Be honest how often do your boys speak to your mother without being prompted... How often do you call or visit for that matter....It sounds like you feel jealous...here is another way to look at it...You could choose to be grateful that your mother has someone and that you don't have to feel guilty or worried because she has people with her who care about her.\n\nYou feel your mother should have put your first..you mother may have not wanted Lily to feel that the minute you turned up she was no longer important or needed.\n\nAnd you kind of proved your mother right..the minute it didn't go your way you packed up and drove 8 hours home taking her grandsons with you. Guess who probably has made your broken hearted mother a cup of tea and is actually being there keeping her company through her upset....\n\nI think you need to think about why you are upset and what you want and what you want would mean to/for your mother...and your mother needs to learn some tact maybe.

It was on me to come to her or no visit, not that she was ever happy to see me anyway. For context we lived in the prairies in Canada; the drive is no better or worse in either direction. It's just flat and straight, boring both ways. I eventually gave up, stopped calling or visiting and she apparently had no issue with that.

Could you have made the trip with your mom, or did work and life not allow you the chance? I'm guessing you probably wouldn't have been able to do that with her. So, would you rather that she couldn't go at all? Or can you be glad that she had this opportunity to take this enjoyable trip with another companion? Another way of looking at it is how about yourself when you are older? Do you want to be able to spend your money as you wish, our do you want your children to guilt you over how you spend it? It is her money, and she's earned it. She can take great trips to Europe and bring someone along if she wants to. If she hadn't gone on this trip, she wouldn't have necessarily given more graduation money to others, and $300 is a very generous graduation gift. So, do I understand why your feelings were hurt? Absolutely, and she should, too. You drove many hours to see her and as her child, she could have made you feel prioritized. But feeling resentful and angry in general about the fact that she has someone nearby that she gets friendship and support from... I think you might be better off in the long run if you try to be a bit more understanding about that.

They were much closer to my cousins who lived near them, which sometimes showed in monetary ways and I was never bother by that because I was never taught I was entitled to what they had and it just seemed logical to me.\n\nFamily by choice is still family. You are caught on this thing about her wanting a girl, and I believe that is real and is a trauma you hold deep. But she isn't close to Lily *now* because Lily is a girl. She's close because Lily spends time with her, helps her, is there for her every day, because they have a bond that quite frankly your kids cannot have when you have kept your mother at arm's reach. \n\nFamily by choice is family. Your mom is incredibly generous to make college accounts for her grandkids, she'd be well within her rights to not. But she has, she's made college accounts, and made those for her biological grandkids much larger.\n\nHow often do your kids call her? Take an interest in her and her life? Off their own back? At least one is old enough he has had plenty of time to make his own relationship with her.\n\nThe parking spot is Lily's, because Lily parks there every single day. You regressed to childhood because you are still holding onto all that trauma, but you need to get some therapy and learn to respond like an adult, stop being so entitled, and take a step back.\n\nHonestly, until I saw this comment I could accept this was NTA or ESH, but come on. Really?", "Thanks - sons didn\u2019t belong in that sentence.", "Really like your metaphor there, very visual and clear to the point of what this entire post is about", "She is paying for there college", "Sounds like OP has his own money and the neighbour is not as fortunate.", "Maybe her own sons were just not interested in her culture and language and she has more in common with Lily - hence the Europe trip? Different treatment is not always based on malevolence; some parent-child pairings just \u201cclick\u201d more than others.", "She gave her *actual* grandchildren $300 but took the neighbor's child to Europe for 2 months. We have plenty of information.", "Presumably she's in her late 50s at a minimum. I wouldn't expect any significant changes in character at this point in her life...", "[removed]", "Yup to all you said. \n\nAlso mom probably had an empty nest by the time Lily came around. Her boys are all grown and have left the house. She\u2019s probably retired/semi retired by then and have a lot of time on her hands to look after Lily. Lily and her mom probably treats the mom really well and have become family. And they\u2019re right next door when OP and his brothers live pretty far away. They probably look out for the mom as much as the mom looks out for them. It\u2019s a relationship 16 years in the making while OP and his brothers are away living their own lives. \n\nI get the feeling that the parking is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back as the feeling of resentment built up towards someone who takes up a lot of mom\u2019s money and time. Moving the car because it\u2019s parked in Lily\u2019s spot isn\u2019t such a big deal, imo. It makes sense since it is Lily\u2019s spot and has probably been since she could drive. Also she\u2019s a girl so I\u2019d give her prime spot too. In my house we have an unspoken rule that girls\u2019 cars are closest to the door, boys\u2019 cars are further away. Girls tends to wear heels, carry more things so it makes sense for their car to be closer. We have the same kind of unspoken rule when we go to our mom\u2019s house. People with babies/young kids get the closest to the door spot, then girls then guys. None of us ever realised it was even a rule until a friend pointed it out. I guess in our collective minds it all just makes sense. \n\nBack to the OP I do think OP is YTA for leaving in a huff without a conversation. But also I don\u2019t see what a conversation can do as I don\u2019t think that OP is entirely reasonable. My mom loves my daughter, even though she is the most difficult grandchild, because my daughter loves hanging out with my mom. Whenever my mom wants to go away for a holiday she\u2019ll always invite my daughter to go with her. They go on trips together fairly often. My other nieces and nephews aren\u2019t really jealous because they don\u2019t like hanging out with my mom quite as much as my daughter does. If my mom goes out to eat, she\u2019ll always ask my nephew to go with her. He is a proper foodie and she loves going out to restaurants with him. On my in law\u2019s side, my kids never get money for visiting, but my nieces get money from them on a regular basis (since January to October my nieces have gotten $4000 each). Their parents are divorced and my in laws started giving them money to cheer them up since it happened. It\u2019s been 10 years and they\u2019ve never stopped giving them money. My kids aren\u2019t jealous at all and they all still go visit their grandparents weekly and just spend time with them because apart from the money, the grandparents treat them all the same. My MIL will cook all the grandchildren\u2019s favourite dishes each week, asks about their week, chats with all of them. My in laws love having all the kids over and if mine can\u2019t make it they\u2019ll be really bummed and will make it a priority to see them on a different day. \n\nThere is more to family dynamics than just gotta treat everyone the same no matter what. Some needs more, some needs less, some makes better travel companions, some makes better eating companion. Some they actually enjoy spending time with because the feeling is mutual. \n\nIf I lived hundred of miles away, and my mom was taken cared of by a wonderful neighbour who makes my mom happy, I\u2019d be eternally grateful and I would not resent the relationship my mom would have with that person. That person is helping me live the life that I chose without having to worry about my mother potentially being alone and lonely.\n\nEdit - thanks for the awards!", "What a weird assumption", "There's \"family of origin\" and there's \"family of choice\".", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bjd41e/aita_for_throwing_away_my_boyfriends_potentially/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "Of course, the treatment is going to be different.

Op also said he moved for college and stayed away, which I assume he moved for college when in his late teens or early 20's, so over 30 years ago.

You are ascribing motives to your mother that may or may not be true. It\u2019s easy to dismiss Lily as \u201cthe granddaughter your mother always wanted\u201d and paint yourself and your boys as unwanted blameless victims. Yet in your comments you share a lot more insights. Lily and her mom are a deep part of her everyday life. You say Lily and your mom help each other with medical appointments, Lily arranges your moms dog grooming, takes her to the Apple Store to help her buy technology, and are there for each other every day. You and your sons can be close with her but it\u2019s \u201cwe live 8 hours away and have our own lives\u201d close. Lily is \u201cyou are my everyday life and we love, help and depend on each other\u201d close. \n\nCan you reframe this in your head that you are so fortunate your mom has the love, caring and companionship of Lily?\n\nDid your boys ever ask to go see your mom for a week or two during school holidays? Did they take an interest in the language and culture?  The Europe trip sounds so wonderful that your mom got to travel and found someone to go with her and share it with? Why are you bitter?  Your mom and dad taught Lily Italian and French. She came over and learned from them, day in and day out, year in and year out? And she expressed interest in not only the language but the culture. It culminated in them planning and taking a trip to visit the places they\u2019d spent years talking about. Is that what you said in your comments?\n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe your boys a trip to Europe, for goodness sake. And don\u2019t make comparisons. She gave each of her grandsons 300. She also took a trip with a friend she\u2019s close with. Maybe she framed it as a gift so Lily wouldn\u2019t feel guilty. I am speculating on this part but I wonder if your son and nephew given the choice would have said yes to giving up their whole summer after high school to leave their friends and travel around alone with their grandmother. Not everyone thinks that sounds fun. \n\nSo please don\u2019t be jealous. If you want to be closer to your mother, go back and visit. Learn her norms. Learn her day to day (including who parks where). Spend time with her. Have your boys do the same. Love is a verb and there is plenty of it for Lily and all of you. \n\nAt the end of the day, she could have let Lily park on the street for once instead of having you move. But you read so much meaning into it and came away with a lifetime of hurt which you say you\u2019ve never discussed with your mother. Could this be the right time for you to speak to her?", "YTA. You live 8 hours away, and only see your parents once a year. It makes sense that, they would view their neighbors, whom they spend a lot of time with and also have seemingly helped raised, as a sort of family. I think it's nice that your mom has someone looking out for her, and helping her with her day-to-day. It just seems like you're mad that your mom has made a life without you, even though you live so far away, and don't seem to talk very often.  \n\nThere is nothing stopping you from getting your kids French/Italian lessons. Or facetimeing your parents everyday so they could teach your kids more of their language and culture. I think it's unfair to put all of that on your parents, when you have done nothing to facilitate that sort of relationship.\n\nAs far as parking in the driveway, I think you overreacted. She seems to have an agreement to let the girl park in her driveway, so you should have just moved your car. Instead you blew that up for no reason, and drove home. It seems like you're just jealous of Lily and wanted an excuse to go home. \n\nIf you want you or your sons to have a relationship with your parents, you are going to have to apologize, and actually put in effort.\n\nEdit: also, I just saw this comment that you posted\n> I did and she brought up that the college accounts she set up for my sons are much larger than the one she has for Lily (even though she spent approximately $2,000 per year on Lily\u2019s school) and that she sees Lily every day and she knows the languages.\n\nSo your mom is paying for your boys college expenses. But you're mad that she is also paying for Lily's school (even though she's paying less for Lily). And it makes sense that she would want to take the one kid who has an interest in her life/language/culture on a trip, because you and your sons clearly don't care. YTA!", "Yta \nLily parks in the driveway every day, she takes your mother to doctors appointments, helps her around the house, spends quality time with her, and sees her weekly, if not daily. They are obviously very close to each other.\n\nYou see her twice a year, you are at least 20 years older than Lily if not more. \n\nWhy is her wanting a daughter even an issue here? You were a grown man when Lily entered your mom's life at 2 yrs old. The jealousy is just weird. Who feels like they are competing with a child. Be grateful your mom has such a solid support system right next door.  \n\nYou were the guest and in Lily's parking spot. So move your car without the drama.", "All that typing to ask about the parking spot?  If that is all then yes YTA. \n\nBut tell us inspite of all she did for the other family, did she ever let you or your kids down?  Or are you just jealous about her treatment?  It is her money.  Would your son and nephew have gone on an 8 week trip with grandma? (Would have had to kill my sons to get them to leave their game systems so long.  They gladly would have take $300 over the trip. )  How did she handle the holidays, graduations, birthdays? Where has she let you and your kids down?\n\nOh yeah. The parking spot. Is there a reason she needs to park there? Street fills up before she gets home, lighting, safety?\n\nAll I see is me me me.", "YTA. \n\nFirst, you decided to omit that your mom set up bigger college funds for your kids. Sounds like your mom considers Lily as family and picked the one grandkid (related or otherwise) who would actually enjoy going on a one-on-one tour with her. \n\nSecond, while you mentioned that your mother wanted girls, there seem to be no other complaints or instances of bad parenting from her side. It's only once your mom met Lily and her mom (which is after you became an adult) that your mom started getting attached to someone outside the family.\n\nThird, Lily seems like she genuinely cares about your mom. Love goes beyond blood as you mentioned that your dad walked Lily's mom down the aisle even. Funnily enough, you seem to have taken zero interest in getting closer to this \"adopted\" family that your parents obvious care about.\n\nFourth, you are in your 50s..that means your mom must be in her 70s? Considering that, she's probably set in her ways due to her age. In her head, the driveway is where Lily parks everyday, so the driveway needs to be clear for her. I doubt that your mom would've thought much further. I agree that it was unnecessary of her to ask you to move your car but old people can be weird like that. \n\nYou seem to be carrying a lot of resentment towards your mother. It's unclear whether that started before Lily came into your lives but I'd suggest that you talk with your mom instead of not robbing your sons of their grandmom (that they rarely see anyway) in her remaining days.", "YTA. Maybe you're just a shitty son and she prefers the neighbor because theyre not.", "YTA. You are a 50-year old man who lives 8 hours away from your mom, visits 1-2 times a year, and are jealous of an 18-year old girl.

What is stopping you and your adult sons from visiting more? \n\nAnd again, why are you jealous of an 18-year old girl when you are in your 50s? Over a parking spot???", "YTA if that's a parking spot that she lets her neighbor use the neighbor would expect it to be there. I never park in someone's driveway, even close family, unless I'm absolutely certain that nobody uses that spot.\n\nAs far as the bigger relationship goes... She's closer with the friend who she sees every day than the family she doesn't see very often. $300 is still more of a graduation gift than most people get. It sounds like she took her neighbor to Europe because she's shown an interest in your mom's culture that nobody in her family has.", "Yta, sounds like you're just jealous of a teenager lmao.", "Going against the grain here: YTA. You seem to feel entitled to things if your mothers that she\u2019d rather give Lily. You aren\u2019t. It\u2019s your moms stuff to with as she pleases. Her money, her driveway. Also, when you are a house guest, parking where the homeowner asks you to is just basic decency.", "YTA. \n\nYou are jealous of a young girl, and sound immature for a 50 year old. You left a lot of details out of the original post (hence the NTAs). Your mom has a large college fund for your children??? Wtf. So she took Lily to Europe. She is helping your sons through college and contributing MORE to their future. \n\nsecondly, you visit your mom twice a year and still feel entitled to her garage space? Lilly is there every day, tending to YOUR mother, giving her company, learning her recipes and likely cooking for her. And where are you? Do you call every day? Every week? What did YOU do for your mother for TG? Lilly prolly has a spot in your mother's garage for the past several years. And she likely deserves one. \n\nYTA for behaving like blood relationships should naturally trump all other human connections in spite of people behaving like asses. Your mom, who's prolly 72-75yo was desperately calling you to make you understand the situation and you couldn't be bothered to come back?

Did you ask her to teach you and your kids how to speak French or Italian( even over zoom calls)?

Your mom got a trip of a lifetime with a dear friend who genuinely enjoys her company while you just complain that she doesn\u2019t give you extravagant gifts like a trip. If she offered you an all expenses paid trip for 8 weeks but she had to go with, would you take it? I doubt it.\n\nYTA and need to reflect on how to appreciate your mom and lily.

I don\u2019t personally feel like your mom being generous to Lily is THAT bad. $300 is fairly generous for graduation money, you\u2019re thinking about this as if Lily is just some random person with no different qualities than your son, but she connected with your mom in ways that you and your son haven\u2019t. Lily is a friend to your mom if anything. And I\u2019m guessing that \u201ctrip to Europe\u201d probably included France and Italy as-well?\nI don\u2019t think anyone is the AH here, and I don\u2019t think anyone sucks either.

I mean please, she lives next door.\n\nEdit to add* you conveniently left out a lot of information. She paid for your kids tuition\u2026 you\u2019re jealous. You\u2019re NAH but you will be an AH if you keep disrespecting your mother online without at least communicating with her.\n\nEdit to add more: after reading MORE I now see Lily is basically a caretaker for your mom.

Why didn't you and your brother  ever make an effort to bond or learn from your parents? Learn their language? Learn to cook with them? Hear their stories?\n\nBecause here's the god honest truth, OP, your mom, even though you think she always wanted a girl and resents you? She loves you. She does. But your mom, like any other person on this earth, has her own affinities, ones you did nothing to learn about or cultivate. She still seems to care a lot for you and the rest of the family but can you blame her for also caring for this other part of her family?

Also, I just find it funny that people are calling your sons neglected when she's paying their college tuition.\n\nWhile I agree that asking you to move your car just so that Lily can take the driveway is kind of unreasonable, I don't see why that should be such a big deal to you. Clearly the parking space isn't the real problem here - it's about you feeling neglected for probably many years, resentful that your mother seems to love Lily more, and perhaps inferior somehow for being a man. However, nowhere in your post or comments do you mention having actually laid out and discussed how you feel to your mom. Maybe if you spoke with her about this years ago you two could have worked this out, but as it stands you seem deeply bitter about favoritism that you attribute to gender, when the most probable explanation is just proximity.

I get that you probably felt slighted over the years by what is basically your younger sister at this point. But, if you are 10+ years older than her, it's time to let it go.

I don't think it is out of line to take her on a Summer trip abroad while grandkids get cash. Let's be honest, the kids probably wouldn't have had fun for those 2 months, but I bet Lily had some wonderful experiences to bring back especially because she learned the languages.\n\nI think a little empathy for Lily is needed (as well as some for you from your mom - talk to her - don't accuse - she may not even be aware you feel this strongly), but also some pride for your mom.

This seems to be literally the only example of anything close to unfair treatment you can muster, because doing something nice for other people doesn't mean that thing has been taken away from you. And then you throw a tantrum like an actual toddler and say 'I'm leaving' because your mum doesn't kick Lily out of her usual spot for your convenience? Clearly this goes deep, but just because you are upset, doesn't mean they've done something wrong.\n\nI will say that again.\n\nJust because you're upset, doesn't mean they've done something wrong.\n\nYou are in your 50s, and have children who you are supposed to be modelling maturity and wisdom for. Get therapy so you can at least make a start on that.", "YTA. By your own admission you have made little to no effort to maintain a relationship with your mother since leaving for college (30 years ago or so). Your kids don\u2019t even know or have affection toward your mother, based on your comment that they didn\u2019t care about your tantrum - and it WAS a tantrum. Meanwhile Lily has treated her as a surrogate grandmother for almost 20 years now, making an effort to establish and nurture a relationship. You couldn\u2019t even be bothered to express interest in learning your mother\u2019s native tongue, which you admit and yet still resent Lily for! Then, you go home and discover your mom and Lily have an arrangement based on their everyday routine. There was no reason for you to be ungracious about it. You assume this is because Lily is a woman because it\u2019s easier to blame a factor out of your control (i.e. your gender) than one that\u2019s in your control (i.e. your active efforts toward nurturing a relationship with your mom). Based on the sage disparity - with you in your late 40s to early 50s at a minimum - Lily didn\u2019t exist for most of your life. Unless your mother was negligent your entire life - which you have no said - you cannot blame Lily for your own willful alienation of your mother. \u201cThe phone works both ways\u201d when it comes to relationships. You get what you put in, and you put in nothing.", "YTA based on your other comments Lily seems to help out your mom a lot. Helping with things around the house, teaching her how to use a phone, scheduling her appointments and driving her to them. She also shares your moms culture and understands her. Did you ever make an attempt to do the same? I\u2019m curious to know where in Europe they went. Italy? France? Maybe Lily has never been. Since she\u2019s already fluent in both languages your mom likely thought it would be a perfect way to repay her and connect her further with her culture. Tbh I think Lily earned that spot in your moms driveway and it isn\u2019t a huge deal for you to just park in the street in front of her house.", "Eh going YTA, some of the NTA's are skipping over the fact that OP is a 50y old with college aged kids who live their own life. Your mom is at an advanced age and likes to dote on her neighbors kids who are a lot closer to her and younger than his kids.\n\nOP is salty that she's spending her money the way she likes it and god forbid has her driveway reserved for herself and the person that drives her places. It was a simple request to move his car, but nope OP decided to make a drama out of it.\n\nWhat cements it for me is the following:\n\n> I did and she brought up that the college accounts she set up for my sons are much larger than the one she has for Lily (even though she spent approximately $2,000 per year on Lily\u2019s school) and that she sees Lily every day and she knows the languages.\n\n> They\u2019re in education accounts for my sons. All 3 used/are using the accounts to help pay for college.\n\nOn the private school part\n> with good public schools and I make too much to qualify for scholarships so she\u2019d have to pay $10,000 for my sons compared to $2,000 for Lily\n\nAs in: she does spend more money on his kids, but also a little bit on her neighbors, and he's salty about it.\n\nOne month of money for his kid would have payed half a year of education for her neighbors kid, a whole year would have amounted to what? 80-90k?", "YTA. You\u2019re letting a host of other issues bubble up over a parking spot. Lilly is like a daughter to your mom and the driveway is her spot. You hella overreacted. But you\u2019re the asshole because you see Lily as someone competing with you for your moms affection and make the parking spot into some weird trophy that goes to the person your mom loves more. Grow up. You\u2019re too old for that immature bs.", "YTA\nMaybe your mom didn\u2019t need to ask you to move your car, but you overreacted. They are neighbors and have an agreement that that is Lilly\u2019s spot. If your mom had an agreement with the adult neighbor that she could park there, would it have been an issue? \n\nA lot of info is left out. It sounds like your mom is filling a void with Lilly because you live far away. Lilly spends more time with her and who knows, many treats her better than you or your children. Maybe you/your children don\u2019t give grandma the time of day? Even if you do when you can, Lilly is there. Which just makes them closer. It sounds like she has a close relationship with that whole family. which is good for her if her own family can\u2019t be around. Also, according to the comments your mom has paid for her grandchildren\u2019s school as well. So her generosity it isn\u2019t as one sided as you portrayed. I think you\u2019re a little jealous. But your mom can spend her money on anyone or anything she likes. She also can vacation with anyone she chooses. Maybe she didn\u2019t think your boys would even want to go anywhere with her. Not everything is done maliciously or intentionally. Maybe you should talk to her about what is really upsetting you instead of storming off.\n\nEdit: OP said they see his mom twice a year. So she made close relationships with neighbors.  OP should be happy for her. Also that his mom taught Lilly the languages and did not teach him. I\u2019ll just say that I have an aunt that didn\u2019t teach her kids Spanish because she wanted to assimilate so badly and didn\u2019t want her kids discriminated against.

Your mom is a person too. How much interest did you or your brothers take in your moms interests (ie learning French and Italian?) Did she spurn you when you showed interest, or did you spurn her by not showing any interest?  It\u2019s ok for people to like what they like and bond with people who have common interests.

You were asked to move a car, nothing life altering. A grown man would have a discussion with his mom as oppose to just packing up an leaving. \n\nYou PURPOSEFULLY left out many details in your list.

Then have a rational adult conversation with your mom.", "I'm going against the grain but I think YTA. From all the comments you have made it seems lily is more of a daughter to your parents than you are a son. She helps your parents out daily and you seem to feel like you are entitled to more than you are getting. It's your parents money and they can spend it however they wish, this includes sending lily on holidays. Also it's a damn parking spot, if lily parks there everyday for years now, she shouldn't have to park on the street because you have made your once a year appearance. Get off your high horse and be a better son, then maybe your parents will treat you better. Also...
