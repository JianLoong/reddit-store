Everything is gross and wrong.", "YTA There are plenty of ways to let him know, even if you did it anonymously it would be better to do than letting him suffer, especially if there\u2019s the potential she gets pregnant by the other guy and he ends up raising the kid as his own, also potential std risks etc. \n\nJust let the poor guy know, wouldn\u2019t you want someone to tell you if it was happening to you??", "YTA - what would you want your family to do if it was you being cheated on ? \nYour whole family are selfish AHs.  \nWhat happens when she gets pregnant and it\u2019s not her husband\u2019s baby ?", "YTA.\nYou're all fooling an innocent man who definitely doesn't deserve this.

The difference is that it was my sister and her husband. I got along with the guy great. For about 2 years I heard that my sister was cheating on him with multiple different dudes all the time. I mean what I was hearing was like she was literally just going out to bars and screwing any guy she could. It was bad. I wanted to tell him, but I didn\u2019t have any real evidence it was happening, just people talking. After a few years she got knocked up. Her husband was fixed, and she knew it wasn\u2019t his. She came clean about it to my parents and eventually I found out. She didn\u2019t want to abort the baby and just hid the pregnancy for as long as she could. During the entire ordeal my parents went along with it, and reluctantly so did I. I thought long and hard about telling him, but all of these crazy scenarios kept popping into my head. What would he do if I told him. Would he hurt my sister, would he hurt himself, would he do some crazy shit, or would he maybe even just confront her, and be upset about but stay with her, then everyone would be mad at me for telling him. I fought with myself over what to do, the entire time this thing was going on until the pregnancy became obvious and she had to come clean. I still remember the phone call from him. We\u2019re very far apart in age. I was about 18 when this happened and he would have been pushing 40. He called me and said \u201chey man I have something I need to talk to you about, and he just broke down and told me how my sister was pregnant and that she had been cheating on him for years etc etc. they had 4 kids together, he provided her with everything, she was an absolute worthless wife and mother. I felt like shit, and I came clean and told him that I knew about it but chose not to say anything because I didn\u2019t know how he would react. He acted like he understood but I could tell he felt some betrayal knowing that I was aware of everything but chose to let him get blind sided. \n\nI totally get the hesitation in telling him what\u2019s happening. There\u2019s so much more at stake here than a few peoples feelings, we\u2019re talking about an entire family being split apart. Imo, you\u2019re NTA, however if you make the same mistake I did, and don\u2019t tell him, when he finds out about you\u2019re going to feel like TA, and he\u2019s probably going to think you\u2019re all AH for letting him get blind sided by this. Tell him. It\u2019s going to crush him, but you have to stop him from having another kid with her.", "NTA\n\nI mean, tell him, obviously. But I get the hesitation. This is going to be an absolute bomb that will shatter your family. And if you have reason to think this will make you lose the relationship with your nephew... that's even worse.\n\nPoor kid will need some stable adults in his life.\n\nBut.\n\nYou can't keep this a secret. If there's a way to let BIL know anon, that would be best. Otherwise, whoever in the family is closest to BIL should take him aside, sit him down, and break the bad news.", "NTA.

Why is she doing this to her husband?  What does she say?\n\nThis is tough because some people want to know if they are being cheated on and some people shoot the messenger.
