Maybe their expectation was totally unreasonable, or you were justified, but it really doesn't change anything.\n\nThe fact they blew up basically means you weren't clear enough with them about what was going to happen.  And while I agree it's lame not to pay up when you need the cash, it's also pretty brutal to give up someone's seat, which is basically a disinvite in practice.  (I'm assuming this is not an open seating situation.)\n\nTo not be an asshole, you needed to look out for your friends a bit more, despite their badness at social-money problems, and give them a crystal-clear, personal heads up so they aren't finding out rudely on Facebook.  At this point, you should definitely apologize and find a way to help fix it.  Otherwise this friendship is probably going to be pretty messed up.\n\nNow not paying up immediately and fairly is a cardinal money sin.  But before you judge them harshly, remember that you're also making some poor financial decisions right here.  You should never put anything on a credit card that you don't have the cash backing to pay off immediately.  That's a cardinal sin too.\n\nNow personally, I'd probably pay a bit extra to be excused from the Brooks concert.. but that part just makes me an asshole, not you.", "ESH\n\nYou should have told them that you were selling them.

I'm just saying it makes her an asshole that she handled it this way, and it's pretty obvious they feel that way too.\n\nIt's hard for me to imagine any kind of situation where a friend _finding out on Facebook_ wouldn't be an automatic YTA.", "whats surprising is your self indulgent \"im just the messenger\" attitude to absolve you from any sort of criticism. again, get off your high horse. \n\nif my friend found out on facebook that something happened they supposedly planned to do with planned time off and didnt pay me back when i needed it, then id be perfectly fine with selling the tickets because of their lack of communication with their planning and promise of paying me back in an agreed upon time.  \n\nher friends were in the wrong and didnt own the tickets. op did what she had to do to maintain her credit since her friends were being flaky. if they didnt want to find out on facebook, they should have communicated better and be better friends by sticking to the agreement.", "You make your point crisply, so I don't want to argue.\n\nI've never actually heard \"get off your high horse\" actually said/typed in anger before.  Isn't the point of this sub to make moral judgements?  Or maybe I miss the metaphor.", "the metaphor means you come off as an ass who considers himself a superior know it all and that you need some humility. \n\nby claiming to be just the messenger, you are trying to absolve your self indulgent know it all ass self of your criticism of op and avoid criticism you may endure. its a cheap deflection. how can you just be the messenger while also saying youve been in shady situations that back up what you are saying which in turn just means you are the one giving the advice?"]}
