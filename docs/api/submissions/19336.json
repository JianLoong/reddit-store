Maybe their expectation was totally unreasonable, or you were justified, but it really doesn't change anything.\n\nThe fact they blew up basically means you weren't clear enough with them about what was going to happen.  And while I agree it's lame not to pay up when you need the cash, it's also pretty brutal to give up someone's seat, which is basically a disinvite in practice.  (I'm assuming this is not an open seating situation.)\n\nTo not be an asshole, you needed to look out for your friends a bit more, despite their badness at social-money problems, and give them a crystal-clear, personal heads up so they aren't finding out rudely on Facebook.  At this point, you should definitely apologize and find a way to help fix it.  Otherwise this friendship is probably going to be pretty messed up.\n\nNow not paying up immediately and fairly is a cardinal money sin.  But before you judge them harshly, remember that you're also making some poor financial decisions right here.  You should never put anything on a credit card that you don't have the cash backing to pay off immediately.  That's a cardinal sin too.\n\nNow personally, I'd probably pay a bit extra to be excused from the Brooks concert.. but that part just makes me an asshole, not you.", "ESH\n\nYou should have told them that you were selling them.

Period.", "Once, a friend of mine ordered concert tickets for her and her sisters and I and said she'd pay for mine as a birthday present. After the tickets were purchased her financial circumstances changed, she told me she couldn't afford to cover my ticket after all, so I paid her for it. I wasn't mad at her for that because not only had she made the promise when she thought she could afford it, she only made it once ticket buying day came and we were able to get them for less than we'd expected- when we decided we wanted to go I'd thought I'd be paying for my own because it would've been way too generous a gift. But OP's friends seem like they made plans they knew they couldn't afford and assumed they'd be able to... somehow trick OP into paying for them?  Just ridiculous.", "> I hate when friends take advantage of the person who generously puts the whole amount of an excursion on their credit card! \n\nIt's not so common in the States, but here in Ireland we pay each other *immediately at the table* with an app like Revolut when splitting a tab (most restaurants here won't split tabs).  You could do it in the US, you've got Venmo and Paypal and stuff.", "I was this naive person for years. I'd put my card down, then no one would pay and/or they would cancel last minute and I'd be scrambling to beg people to go for free so the reservation didn't go to waste. One time in my teens, I split a pizza with friends and I put down a $20. Didn't get any money back. I'm small, so I usually only eat 1-2 slices. $20 for a slice of pizza. And this was like 15 years ago before the crazy inflation.\n\nI don't pay for things for friends anymore, or if I do I just consider it a gift and don't expect to get paid back.", "The families need to know.\n\nWatch out for Waspes!", "Surprised how far I had to go to see this. I completely agree. Yes OP asked them multiple times BUT I doubt the friends knew that the tickets being sold out from under them was an option, because honestly it's a spiteful thing to do. They are wrong for not paying when they said they would. But OP is also wrong for not at least giving them one last chance and letting them know that if they didn't pay up they'd have no tickets. OP is also wrong for not telling them directly and letting them find out on FB. What if they hadn't seen the post? Do they get to the concert and find out there? Again, very spiteful behavior to people you call friends. I wouldn't associate with any of them.", "How many reminders is enough for you? They agreed to pay by X date and OP reminded them multiple times.  They even said afterwards they had no intention to pay on time since they were ok with OP being stuck with the min monthly payment and interest.", "If they took it so seriously enough to make sure in advance that they had time off, they should have made sure they paid for them in advance, too. Especially when op kept texting them in advance.", "They did send reminder texts.  If the friends didn't assume that was a warning, then they were planning on taking advantage of OP. Wo needs friends like that?", "Especially with so many forms of virtual direct payments nowdays like Venmo, Zelle or even Google Pay. I remember back before it was common, I've had to go to an ATM to withdraw cash, count out the exact amount I need down the cent, and physically hand the cash over to people. \n\nNow my friend simply can order the tickets, send me the amount they need, and I can pay them back in minutes from the comfort of my own toilet bowl if I so want to.", "Every purchase has its own \"pay back\" deadline, and normally it's whatever works with friends. \n\nIf someone covers my tab? Yeah, I'm Zelling them or something immediately. \n\nSomething big like this that requires agreements and huge costs? Whatever we agree on, that's what I'm paying back. So it's not a US thing, just crappy friends thing.", "Venmo is used by many in the US, and specifically for splitting tabs, not sure where you get the \"it's not common in the states\"", "Love Revolut for that, they even have a specific feature for a group splitting a bill.", "At the moment, for most lenders, utilization is a snaphsot in time thing, so it only matters at the point you need a good credit score. \n\nBut I learned from another redditor that [Fico 10t](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/new-fico-score-10-t) (the trended version) will take this into account. And that model is now available with adoption probably coming over next few years by lenders. The score will be available with and without trended info so lenders may still not take into account historic utilization.", "Yeah that's because your credit utilization % went up. If it put your credit utilization over 30-40% you'll see a big drop.", "Yeah, but she didn't send that \"pay now or lose out\" text.  It's unfortunate that it's what many people need, but it's what many people need.", "This isn't about reminding them.  It's about letting them know what happened rather than being passive-aggressive or being too much of a coward to let them know the tickets were gone.  The above comment suggests doing so by telling them an hour beforehand (giving one last chance), but OP could also have told them after... but didn't.\n\nI get that this sub has very black-and-white and frankly vengeful thinking, but if OP had more thoughtfulness than fear and/or pettiness, OP would have just texted, \"Since you didn't pay, I had to sell the Garth Brooks tickets to someone else.  Sorry it didn't work out this time.\"\n\nIf OP wanted to be a brat, another text could have gone, \"I hope your cash flow problems get resolved soon!\" But OP found a way to be a brat by passive-aggressively hinting the tickets were gone through public social media posts the friends had to stumble across.  That may be delicious to your typical reader here, who loves meeting rudeness with revenge, but it's still rude.\n\nNTA for selling them, but ESH because of how it went down.", "But again at the point they hadn't even paid op a couple bucks towards the tickets.", "Goodmorning Julia!", "Oh I so just saved your comment. Nice!", "I have a personal rule: Never lend anything that you aren't prepared to give away. This goes for money and items.

Back in the mid-90\u2019s my SIL asked my wife for a loan of $500 for rent and utilities. Her husband was an alcoholic druggie with a gambling problem. After a six months my wife asked her sister for repayment of the money because we had learned they had gone on vacation and were constantly bragging about their trip. My wife was furious! Well SIL did not like being confronted and tried to make my wife the guilty party by saying she didn\u2019t need the money and that she was a money grubber. It was tough seeing my wife hear this because she has a good heart and never thought it would sour their relationship. SIL finally paid wife back a month later when she appeared at our front door to drop off the money. She never apologized just acted as if my wife was bad guy in this situation. Good thing was she never asked for another dime and she finally divorced her jerk of a husband after 15 years of marriage.", "I had this in HS when I put the prom limo  in my name and paid the deposit. I was 18 before everyone and everyone had agreed to go together. They were mostly my husband's friends. They told me a few days before prom  they couldnt come when I asked for the rest, one  said it was because of academic probation and the administration took it away, other has excuses.  My husband split the cost with me. It really sucked for us to pay for a whole limo but we couldn't cancel. I would have lost the deposit which was not a little sum.  We ended up having the limo driver pick up my parents and take them around  for their anniversary while we were inside prom and drop them off before the driver came to get us. I didn't want to pay all that money just for it to sit outside the venue for hours. We got inside and they were there and rode in a different limo. That was one of the many  reasons why I hated about them. They are not in our lives 17 years later.", "Probably from living in the US for 40-someodd years and going out to eat a lot, but hey, who's counting?", "They were never going to pay", "They most likely weren\u2019t trying todo that and just were being inconsiderate; but they did lie after agreeing to pay for the tickets by a certain time. So I think OPs response and reaction is completely reasonable.", "I'm working on building my and my wife's credit scores. Whenever our total utilization is over 10% at the time the cards report to the bureaus, our scores drop by a few or several points. I don't let our utilization go much over 10%; so I don't know what it might look like at 30+. Also, this might have an outsized impact on our scores since our overall length of credit is quite short and we have what seems to me to be a relatively low total available credit (under $10k).", "Then they don't need to go to the concert.", ">but she didn't send that \"pay now or lose out\"\n\nShe didn't need to.

Once a deadline passes the offer is off the table.", "Her friends are adults.
