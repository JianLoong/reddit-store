Maybe their expectation was totally unreasonable, or you were justified, but it really doesn't change anything.\n\nThe fact they blew up basically means you weren't clear enough with them about what was going to happen.  And while I agree it's lame not to pay up when you need the cash, it's also pretty brutal to give up someone's seat, which is basically a disinvite in practice.  (I'm assuming this is not an open seating situation.)\n\nTo not be an asshole, you needed to look out for your friends a bit more, despite their badness at social-money problems, and give them a crystal-clear, personal heads up so they aren't finding out rudely on Facebook.  At this point, you should definitely apologize and find a way to help fix it.  Otherwise this friendship is probably going to be pretty messed up.\n\nNow not paying up immediately and fairly is a cardinal money sin.  But before you judge them harshly, remember that you're also making some poor financial decisions right here.  You should never put anything on a credit card that you don't have the cash backing to pay off immediately.  That's a cardinal sin too.\n\nNow personally, I'd probably pay a bit extra to be excused from the Brooks concert.. but that part just makes me an asshole, not you.", "ESH\n\nYou should have told them that you were selling them.

Need to use credit to build credit", "sort of? so the corporations that actually calculate your credit score use different equations to do so, and those equations are a secret, mostly, and they change every once in a while. they\u2019re mostly sussed out at this point, but there are some blank spots. \n\nother countries do it similarly but not the exact same way, and your credit score in the US means *mostly* nothing to credit scoring agencies overseas. additionally some countries don\u2019t even have credit scores, and funnily enough they weren\u2019t a thing anywhere until 1989.", "Yes I'm from a country where credit scores exist but they don't mean nearly as much as they do in the US. A small percentage of the population uses credit cards. I only tracked it to feel good about myself lol. I'm just curious about how they calculated it. \n\nI now live in a country where credit scores don't exist, you can pay to get their equivalent, but no one does unless you're asked to for a big purchase like a mortgage. Also not as much credit card usage.", "yeah, the way they\u2019re handled here is nuts. it can effect your ability to rent housing, and some jobs will even pull your credit score before hiring you. which is actually becoming more common as time goes on. the amount it can effect your life leads me to believe that it\u2019s a social cancer personally, but not everyone feels that way.", "I couldn't agree more. It's just another way to punish the working class for *checks notes* being born poor?", "yeah, at least in the US you could basically just score people on their zip code of birth and largely get the same overall result most of the time for most people."]}
