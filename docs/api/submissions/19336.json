Find less entitled friends and ones who can read.", "Some of these judgments are really easy...\n\nNTA. They don't pay, they don't go. No excuse, here. They had multiple reminders and opportunities. Maybe they'll learn to keep their promises, but it doesn't look promising if they're angry at you and not their own (in)actions.", "NTA They didn't pay you, so you were justified in selling them to someone else.", "NTA!!! I hate when friends take advantage of the person who generously puts the whole amount of an excursion on their credit card! I am the same way\u2026.I pay it off in full every month and I would not be okay with just paying the minimum and not the whole statement balance. Your friends are selfish and petty! That\u2019s so crazy they expected you to front them for 4 tickets!\n\nEnjoy the concert!!!!!!", "NTA. You asked for money at a certain time. You set a clear expectation and they didn\u2019t pay. They made an assumption that should never have been made, especially since you were clear with them. And good for you for paying your full bill every month. We do that too, if we won\u2019t be able to pay in full that month, then we don\u2019t buy it.", "NTA. You told your friends when you needed to be paid. They ignored you. If they had even so much as said, \"I can pay X now, but I need to pay you the rest later,\" they might have a case. As it is, you had every right to give the tickets to people who could pay for them.", "NTA. I'm guessing they would've \"forgotten\" the bill was due if they didn't see your sister going. Maybe it would be different if they asked to set up a payment plan, but they tried to use you and realized it was a mistake.", "Haha! NTA\n\nyour terms and conditions were clear. Good for you for protecting your credit score.", "NTA. So they couldn\u2019t afford to go, and we\u2019re hoping you\u2019d float them by paying crazy high credit card interest? Nope.  They could have said no, they could t afford it, but assured you they would have the cash in time.", "NTA.  As soon as someone else uses their credit card to buy something on your behalf you should pay them.\n\nHonestly sounds like you might have ended up with never being paid for the tickets.", "NTA. Post lots of pictures. Video.  Hell, having a beer out of Garth's boot. Its the most super awesome fantastic time.  They farted around & fucked themselves over.", "NTA, even if you had only asked for payment once would still not be TA, the fact they \"forgot\" more then once and didn't say anything about it for more then a week is sus on their parts.", "NTA. I bet you had much more fun with your sisters and their husbands than your friends. You had no choices, but to ask around about who you can give tickets if your friends could not pay on time! It might be time for you to look into a new group of friends if you are still having issues with those ones who don't respond to you!", "NTA. Your friends FAFO.", "NTA. Your friends are entitled narcissists.", "NTA at all! You gave them plenty of warnings, IN WRITING!! There\u2019s really not much more you could have done. \nYou are super responsible in making sure you pay off your balance every month. Wtg!!  But I will add one thing. Even if you just pay the minimum required on your credit card, that won\u2019t \u201cscrew with your credit\u201d. All it will do is charge you interest for the month, whereas when you pay the balance in full, there\u2019s no interest added. Just an FYI!", "NTA", "NTA you had an agreement for them to pay you in full before your card was due.  The kept \"forgetting\".  The missed the payment deadline and you sold the tickets to another party.", "NTA. So what you\u2019re saying is that they wanted free tickets.. as long as OP pays the minimum. Yeah no. Remove those friends.", "NTA I bet they were planning on continually forgetting so they never had to pay", "YTA. How hard would it have been for you to send a quick text to follow up? \"Hey guys, reminder that I need you to reimburse me in full for your Garth tickets ($x) by [y date] before my credit card bill is due, as we agreed. Otherwise I'm going to sell them because I don't carry a credit card balance and I won't be paying off your tickets. Thanks!\"\n\nYou never say in your post that you told them you were going to sell the tickets or do anything with them. Should they have paid you? Of course, but many people are comfortable having things on their card. You could have asked them to pay the interest if you were that concerned. But you didn't even tell them you were going to sell them.\n\nDo you even like your friends?", "NTA\u2026.y in the world would you pay the minimum on your credit card and pay exorbitant interest for their tickets..", "YTA\n\nDon't downvote me, just listen.  It's not me saying she's an asshole, it's her friends, and I think that's the point of this sub.\n\nThe reason people get upset like this is when they had a certain expectation, and then you did something different from that expectation.  Maybe their expectation was totally unreasonable, or you were justified, but it really doesn't change anything.\n\nThe fact they blew up basically means you weren't clear enough with them about what was going to happen.  And while I agree it's lame not to pay up when you need the cash, it's also pretty brutal to give up someone's seat, which is basically a disinvite in practice.  (I'm assuming this is not an open seating situation.)\n\nTo not be an asshole, you needed to look out for your friends a bit more, despite their badness at social-money problems, and give them a crystal-clear, personal heads up so they aren't finding out rudely on Facebook.  At this point, you should definitely apologize and find a way to help fix it.  Otherwise this friendship is probably going to be pretty messed up.\n\nNow not paying up immediately and fairly is a cardinal money sin.  But before you judge them harshly, remember that you're also making some poor financial decisions right here.  You should never put anything on a credit card that you don't have the cash backing to pay off immediately.  That's a cardinal sin too.\n\nNow personally, I'd probably pay a bit extra to be excused from the Brooks concert.. but that part just makes me an asshole, not you.", "ESH\n\nYou should have told them that you were selling them.  Mild Y T A there.  It's impolite and you knew they would be upset.  \n\nThey are massive A H's for disrespecting you. \n\nAs in kindergarten 2 wrongs don't make a right", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
