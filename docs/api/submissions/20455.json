You asked and they invited you over. If they weren\u2019t cool with it they\u2019d have said. Just bc your mom didn\u2019t want guests doesn\u2019t mean everyone feels that way", "NTA - YOu asked and they were happy to see you. Your mother needs to mind her own business.", "NTA, you asked permission to go over and give a gift, and they decided to invite you in, and even insisted when you said you didn't want to be a bother. How could you be the a-hole.", "NTA. You did everything right, gave them an out and was not an imposition. You are totally fine", "NTA, you did ask.  How long did you stay?", "NTA you waited, you asked, they said yes, it's none of your mum's business frankly.", "NTA, you asked and they were good with it. Not an issue. Would have been if you didn't ask and just went", "How long did you stay? New parents don't stop being adults, and still need occasional adult company. But they can run out of energy pretty quickly.\nAssuming that their words can be taken at face value, NTA for visiting and entering when invited, but if you stayed for more than half an hour you would have out stayed your welcome.", "You behaved perfectly and respectfully. Your mom is way off base - ignore her. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, every couple has different preferences during this time, and you asked them if it was okay to come over and they invited you in. There is no problem here, you did nothing wrong. Your mom is out of line.", "NTA. You asked first. YWBTA if they had said no and you came anyhow, but this is the most wholesome AITA that my jaded eyes have seen this week, so thank you for sharing it \ud83d\ude03", "NTA at all. It was a very kind gesture and it seems you clearly made a point to do a drop off. I\u2019m assuming your friends are genuine and invited you in because they wanted to. When my first and only was born we had no issue with visitors and we\u2019re quite proud for everyone to see the bundle of joy.", "NTA. Your mom needs to chill. It sounds like you did everything right. The couple wouldn't have invited you in if they didn't want you there.", "NTA at all. I just had a baby 3 weeks ago. I saw in your comments you stayed 20 minutes. That\u2019s perfect and you did everything right leading up to that. Come visit me lol", "NTA - You were going to just leave something at the door. The didn\u2019t even have to answer the door if they were sleeping or busy.", "NTA. They are the ones that get to decide if they are accepting visitors, not your mother. You offered to drop off the gifts, they invited you in: their choice.", "NTA (but your mom is). New parents don't want to be bombarded with visitors, but they sometimes *need* adult friends to talk to.", "NTA. When we had our first, some friends set up a meal train deal so people could drop of meals at our door. They were instructed by our friends to leave the meal stuff in a cooler by the door so as not to disturb us\u2026which was great except we were desperate for company! \ud83d\ude02 We camped by the window and invited everyone in! Your mom needs to stay in her lane. You did everything right.", "NTA. Yes, those first few weeks as a new parent are exhausting, but here's something a lot of people don't want to admit, we want to show off our new little poop machines that we made. Having my daughter was one of the proudest moments of my life and also damn hard work, plus she was cute, so I'd like people to meet her and fawn over her a little. A 20 minute visit after asking and being invited in is not at all rude.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t stay for an awkward or extended period of time, you checked before coming, and you brought useful items. \n\nYou get one knock from me for not bringing them food. \n\nYou know your friends better than your mom and are likely more in tune with \u201ctoday\u2019s parents\u201d.

Did you ask what they needed before choosing the bath items?", "NTA, but you could have also given something before or send them something.", "INFO: is it only your own mum thinking your in the wrong or has your friend said you were wrong for taking their invitation?", "Soft YTA.

As long as you didn't stay super long or demand they make you food or something, you're good. Your mom needs to chill a little, there's definitely situations which put the parents of newborns in a bad position but this wasn't one of them.", "You checked with them, they said it was fine, feel free to ignore your mother. NTA.", "NTA. You waited 2 weeks, had their permission and gave them lots of opportunities to say no. As long as you kept your visit brief, you're good.", "NTA you asked and they couldve let you just leave it if you wanted to. You were considerate. Honestly, having one of my best friends visit me about 2 days after I gave birth was such a welcome relief. It\u2019s nice seeing someone else\u2019s face and talking to other non-sleep deprived adult. As long as you didnt stay for too long I think you\u2019re good.", "NTA. Your mom doesn't know what they want more than they do. All that matters is their opinion. They said yes. \n\nYou waited plenty of time before asking and made sure to go by their comfort level. You didn't just show up and demand they come out to see you.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur mom is an AH, ignore her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe parents of the newlyborn told you it was ok AND invited you in - so you are fine.", "NTA. You asked and they were okay with it.", "NTA. How do you know they wanted to be alone?  Is something your mother said or your friends said? You asked and they said yes. It sounds like you would have taken no for an answer and didn\u2019t push or manipulate. Maybe they were really hoping for company.", "NTA\n\nHer opinion, state your case to her then drop it, this is going nowhere.  If she continues, just look at her and roll your eyes, after a couple of times she should get the hint.  \n\nSomething tells me this happens with other things as well so I am sure you are well versed on how to handle her.", "NTA. Sounds like they were ok with it. By the way, is this whole no one visiting thing a new thing? I\u2019ve had lots of friends and family in the past who had kids and there was never an issue with popping by the hospital or house to say congratulations and bring a gift.", "NTA you asked the couple that\u2019s what matters.

They're the ones who invited you in.", "NTA, it's better don't mind your mother's comment\n at all.", "NTA - you asked whether you could come, they said yes, you didn't overstay your welcome. You're good.\n\nPro tip for the next time you're visiting new parents: bring food. That's the best type of guest. ;)", "NTA you checked with the new born parents it is up to them to decide if they want visitors or not, it's not up to your own mother who has nothing to do with it.", "NTA. You did the right things by asking for permission and everything. It sounded like your friends really appreciate you for asking in a timely manner and wanted to spend some time with you. Keep up the good work. You might even grow closer to your friends as time goes because you are in a position where you know your friends to a point with what they wanted to do while having a baby. If they ask you for something good, go do it for them. :)", "Is your mother the third in their throuple? How on earth is she involved?\n\nIf you asked and they said yes, then NTA.", "About 20 mins", "I\u2019m the kind of person who absolutely hates bothering others, hence why I even made this post, but about 20 mins.", "Aww thank you! Ahaha", "Agreed! I would have been very happy to get a short visit from a friend a few weeks after our baby was born, both for the company and because she was perfect and I wanted everyone to meet her!", "Hi! So the reason my mom is bothering me is because a slight bit more complexity: they are a couple of family friends, who also happen to be our tenants (we are landlords). She also knows them, not as well as I do. I did ask what items they wanted yes. Over where I live normal baby welcoming gifts don\u2019t really include food, although I did also buy some chocolate for the parents and pet treats for their dogs.", "That\u2019s fair yeah. Just not very customary here.", "Just my mom. Friends were happy. For context my mother and I have a complicated relationship because we are both BP II, but I\u2019m medicated and she\u2019s not. And whenever she comments on anything regarding me, although I try to not listen for the most part, its still a work in progress in therapy for me because of the years of gaslighting and such.", "I mean I did ask and they said I could. Maybe I wasn\u2019t super clear on that. But I did wait.", "Not bad.  When people come over, I wish they would only stay for 20 mins, and I don't have a kid, lol", "NTA at all.", "NTA I just had a baby and I was so happy with people coming to visit because I'm an extrovert. 20 minutes is the perfect visiting time.", "Has your mother spent your entire life telling you that you're a bother to others? And she's still telling you to make yourself smaller and stop 'bothering' other people?  \nSomething to think about.", "That was really sweet of you. \n\nYou did nothing wrong \n\nNTA", "Still NTA but I would consider that your role as a landlord, even if you consider them friends, COULD make them feel like they had to welcome you in regardless of whether or not they were wanting visitors. \n\nI think the ideal scenario here is sending a message saying \u201cCongratulations! I want to drop off something for you and the baby. I\u2019ll leave it at the doorstep today around (insert time) incase you\u2019re still not up for visitors. If you think of anything you need before then, let me know and I\u2019ll be happy to pick it up for you!\u201d\n\nEdit: this type of message leaves the ball in their court to say \u201coh no we\u2019d love some adult company!  Let us know when you\u2019re on the way!\u201d Or something", "Yeah, and I mean I get that you wanted to bring it over and it's very nice but I can also see how this is very exhausting for fresh parents.", "If the people you went to see are happy, then you did nothing wrong, they clearly wanted to see you enjoyed the interaction. Everyone is different and your mum is probably just thinking that she wouldn't have wanted guests that early, but your friends were fine with it. NTA, I know it's hard but try to remember your mum's opinions aren't always the ones that matter.", "Maybe they were just polite.", "You're fine. Nobody knows when a family starts taking visitors *until* they ask. It's not a standard one-month window or anything. And it's different from family to family.\n\nYou sound thoughtful. They sound happy to see you. It's all good.", "Me too! I recently bought a door mat that says \u201cOh no! Not you again!\u201d But nobody has taken the hint yet \ud83d\ude02", "Thats pretty much what I did tho. I sent them a message just like that, just not the \u201ctoday\u201d part, but instead asked them what day and time would they be ok with me dropping something off\u201d", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m scared of. Because I really don\u2019t wanna bother them and I make it super clear I would be absolutely fine with a No", "Oh. Then you covered all bases! Totally NTA and I applaud your respectfulness and kindness toward a new family. Continuing to let them know that you are a willing resource/helper if they need anything is pretty much the kindest and most helpful thing anyone can do for a new parent (obviously speaking from experience)", "You offered to just drop a gift at the door and they invited you in. You only stayed for 20minutes. That sounds like an ideal post birth visit to me. Don't let your mom get into your head about this. You were kind and thoughtful, try to not overthink this."]}
