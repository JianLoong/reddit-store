Her younger brother, Marco, got into our university and moved here about 4 years ago. Kate and I are 8/9 years older than Marco (Edit: I am currently 31 and Marco is 22) but when he moved here he immediately got quite attached to me and started to confide in me fairly often, which I wasn't entirely comfortable with but because he's young and clearly has not had the best of friends or peer relationships/family support, I figured I could be there in an older brother capacity. \n\nHe's been dating this girl, Alex, for over a year now. Alex is closer to my age than his (EDIT: she is 29), and comes from a different culture to us. I've noticed her generally belittling him about weight, facial hair, generally shaming him for being immature (and other comments/behaviours that are just very uncomfortable to witness) but when I bring it up to him, he always brushes it off because they are \"in love\" and she's \"just giving some honest feedback to make him more mature\". Recently he confessed to me that she's become very very into Christianity and will not let him practice his own faith. She's told him that premarital sex is a sin and that he cannot even touch her before they get married because of it being a wrong intention. She's also moved into his apartment and assumed financial control of all the bills and belittles the work he does- saying that she should be in charge. Marco still insists she loves him deeply, and that if she wants to get married he will eventually, and when I tried to tell him how bad of an idea this was, he started sobbing because he was scared she would leave him, and that she's the best he can ever do.\n\nI think her behaviour is abusive and he is reacting out of fear, grooming (I know it's not technically grooming given their ages...but the age gap is weird) and anxiety of the unknown. I feel like this is above my pay grade as a friend and while I'll be there to support him if he is willing to get out of this, I should tell Kate what's going on because I think this needs an intervention from someone closer to him than me. When I suggested this to Marco, he got frantic and made me promise I wouldn't tell Kate, but I think even if he hates me for a bit for telling her, it'll be better to be out of this situation than in it.

You are primarily friends with Kate. When this situation comes to a head (and it will) Kate will wonder why you didn't talk to her and it will damage that relationship. Ask if thats the risk you wanna take to protect an abuser? Talk to Kate, and step back.\n\nIm also dubious about the religion thing being the reason for no more sex till marriage. sounds like Alex love-bombed, has now assumed control and cut Marco off while breaking him down. I feel for the guy.\n\nThe marriage pushing is even more dubious if Marco or his family have money/assets.", "NTA. He is definitely in an abusive relationship. Emotional, mental, financial, and who knows what else happens behind closed doors.", "WNBTA. This is very troubling behaviour. I believe you would be right to talk to his sister about this. It sounds like he is being isolated from his family, and she is most definitely manipulating him emotionally and financially.", "I wouldn\u2019t get in the middle of this - it sounds more like Marcos girlfriend is in a cult rather than a relationship with him. But the question is *should you tell his sister* and the answer is YES. Let his family work on it - you can offer your support - but you won\u2019t be the AH by expressing your concerns to his sister.", "NTA - Sounds like emotional abuse to me. I would tell the sister right away.  Those red flags are waving merrily in the hurricane of gf's ill intentions. Even if he never speaks to you again it would be worth it if it helped him get out of this life sucking relationship.", "Marco has been dating Alex for a year.... you are the only person who has noticed her overbearing behavior? Kate has no clue about any of this?\n\nYou need to include Kate. If you truly respect your friendship with her. She was your friend first. Marco is still Kate\u2019s lil brother before your friend. \n\nYWNBTA", "NTA - this is an abusive relationship. She is isolating him and taking over his life and money, so she can isolate him more. It's a cult of one.", "NTA sounds like abuse to me but I wish you had put your ages rather than 8/9 years older.", "NTA. Soooo many red flags here, and like you said, it's above your pay grade. Tell Kate, especially since she's your primary friend (you met Marco through her).", "Honestly, this is a tough one. Not that she shouldnt know, but whether you should be the one to tell her.\n\nIf the gf is being abusive and manipulative then telling his sister behind his back runs the risk of alienating him from the both of you. You dont want to create a situation where the gf can isolate him from you & his sister and make him even more vulnerable.\n\nNTA, but tread carefully.\n\nId maybe consider asking him why he is so against Kate being told - if he knows what her reaction will be, that suggests deep down he knows why its a bad situation & why she would react against it. If you can help his confidence and get him to voluntarily include Kate that would be the best outcome, but if that isnt possible then you might have to tell her anyway.\n\nAlso: Look for some professional resources. Domestic violence resources would be a good place to start - even if they arent directly applicable there will be a lot of overlap & might be able to direct you to the right place.", "YWBTA, even with the best intentions, he specifically asked you not to tell her and you should respect his wishes. I don't know what good would it do if his sister knew, it will just increase the number of people belittling him and considering him immature and not treating him like an adult. If anything he needs your support, he trusts you out of all people and that is not something you want to mess up. Be there for him when he needs you, be vocal about the things you think are wrong about this relationship and let him make his own decisions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From what you've said, there is financial abuse and psychological/emotional abuse going on - possibly also other abuse too which Marco hasn't confided in you.
