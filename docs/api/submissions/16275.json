But if this is causing conflict it means you're not just fact checking but something is happening and there's trust issues happening.\nIf I read into this a bit more it sound like she's either got control issues or you have trust issues, both of which will rot a relationship if not dealt with.", "I fact check myself all the time. I like learning new things. I know it's frustrating when someone else tells a story and you go 'well actually you're wrong', but when I need information, I want to get information from the internet/ a fact checked source.

If OP hides his googling the GF will blow up when she eventually finds out .", "I was going to say the same thing. NTA for double checking Google yourself, but you could be TA in how you approach it with her. You didn\u2019t give details as to how exactly you go about correcting her in these situations. Unless it\u2019s something she absolutely needs to be corrected on (like someone is going to get physically injured because she is relying on inaccurate or straight up false information), maybe just let her believe what she wants and keep your Google-verified updates to yourself. I\u2019d be willing to bet she feels a bit stupid when you call her out for being wrong, and her anger is likely just her reaction to being embarrassed. Keep fact-checking for yourself, but don\u2019t mention it to her for the sake of your relationship and for her happiness and self-esteem.", "Thanks for the insight.

She had some reasons to be mad at me sometimes, because I actually had more confidence in what I think that in what she thinks and sometimes it was me the wrong one. But, apparently, that goes both ways, and somehow we both managed to be more respectful with the other's statements, stuff like \"hmmm, maybe, but let me check it out\" instead \"I think you're wrong, let me show you\". It's the same, but some ways are less annoying to our egos and helps us take less offense.", "To clarify, I didn't say to hide it. I said to not announce it. If OP is doing it in this way it can come across very \"I'm right and you're wrong\". That may be true but it's completely unnecessary to have this approach.", "Her* I'm a woman too. I usually announce it, my girlfriend asked me to hide when I google but I don't want to feel like I have to hide and lie to make my relationship work.

I think it's  wise to remain skeptical, especially when others are often wrong.\n\nThere's no shame in ignorance, as long as one's lack of knowledge doesn't result in actions that hurt others.  Not knowing something is perfectly acceptable.  What's unacceptable is when people who don't know speak like they do.  \n\nIt's unfortunate that your girlfriend doesn't share that view.  You could try to explain that her habit of being confidently incorrect makes it hard to take her at her word, but it sounds like she is unwilling to entertain the thought. You'll have to figure out for yourself if that's a dealbreaker.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n\"I'd trust you with my heart, just not my washer.\"", "NTA.\n\nI don't get it though. It's not like she told you the amount of soda to use, and you didn't believe her. She just told you that you wouldn't get the answer from Google. \n\nSo what did she want you to do? You needed to know how much to put in, neither you nor she knew off hand. What other option is there besides looking it up?", "NTA.

My X was exactly like that. I had to fact check all the \u201c information\u201d she gave me.", "NTA. This sounds like your GF has a hard time accepting she doesn\u2019t know everything.", "NTA\n\nStop asking her first and then googling that's what she's annoyed about.", "NTA. I do the exact same thing. I fact check almost everything I say, and I fact check almost everything anyone else tells me. If I am even slightly unsure, I bring up Google. It literally takes two seconds to do, it's not hard, and it can seriously help reduce misinformation.", "INFO: how often do you do this?", "Okay so this may be too deep for reddit, but I had a similar issue. My gf would get SUPER upset when we'd play trivia. She also didn't like when I'd google things, so it got to the point I'd do it silently beneath my privacy screen or on privacy tabs. It took a lot of talking it out to get to the bottom of it. She even admitted she didn't know why it bothered her so much. \n\nBut the answer kind of dawned on both of us: she was afraid I would think she was stupid. \n\nShe and I are both in the same profession, both very smart, I think she's brilliant. But she does have a lot of self-confidence about not going to the 'same quality' schools as me (all bs, all money making schemes full of debt scams), the fact I have a retentive memory (I remember a LOT of random facts, they just stick in my brain if I like them), that I have read a lot of classic literature and know a lot of history. These things are skills, not smarts. I'm not that good at sports trivia because it genuinely doesn't interest me. I know there are people out there that know all the stats for every baseball game for the last sixty years. That's a skill. No one is born a weird baseball savant knowing this. \n\nAnyway, she and I came to the conclusion that when I 'fact checked' something, it was saying she was wrong, dumb, etc. not to know something. She was too hasty in looking something up, that I didn't trust her. \n\nThe answer is not 'stop fact checking' nor is it 'keep fact checking.' It was more about communication, reassurance in other areas, and genuine gratitude when she did or said things that made my life easier.", "NTA, she's gotta get over her pride, especially when you can verify she was actually wrong about something.", "Google's search engine truly is a blessing. I'm having flashbacks to AskJeeves", "I'm a pretty accomplished home cook and I can make fairly complicated recipes from memory, but let me tell you, every single time I absolutely have to google how long to boil an egg for to get the yolk perfect.", "In this instance the OP is seeing if there\u2019s further explanation on how much soda to use. GF said she didn\u2019t find any, so whats the harm in double checking for an answer? Besides, if GF has a track record of being wrong, then why wouldn\u2019t she want to know the right answer? Isn\u2019t it pretentious of her to be mad that her incorrect information isn\u2019t taken as gospel? The only way i see OP being the asshole is if they\u2019re \u201ctesting\u201d their GF or asking them questions for the purpose of humiliating them, or if their tone is one of condescension when they correct her.", "Fact checking yourself as well as others is why you're NTA. Even if you were just fact checking others I don't think you'd be an A-hole either. \n\nMy partner and I both fact check ourselves - in fact we've both stopped ourselves mid conversation before saying '...actually I'm not 100% and I might be making an assumption, let me look it up and get back to you'.\n\nI tihnk that made me love her even more.", "Frame your inquiry as \u201cfurther research\u201d rather than \u201cfact checking.\u201d Just act like you\u2019re interested in learning more about things rather than correcting her.", "Right, but most people don't get uspet when someone looks it up instead of taking their word for it.", "you shouldn't have to hide that you're googling stuff, she needs to learn how to google better if she hates that she's wrong so often you can't trust anything she says."]}
