Or I say 'I wanna know more' or 'I want to be 100% certain so I'm gonna ask another 3 sources, just because I'm scared of making a mistake'.", "I google a lot in general, it has nothing to do with her specifically. Usually, I google stuff because I'm interested to learn more about whatever topic people told me about, not because I don't believe them. Or I google because it's easier to learn complex information by reading/seeing pictures than through audible conversation. I am more likely to google stuff the more interested I am.", "She's not wrong more often than anyone else! She's very smart, she's just also stubborn and she doesn't double check things as often as I do. I usually believe her, but usually I only double check when I either want even more context or when I feel like her information sounds shaky.\n\nFor example, we also had a disagreement about a mechanic in a game we both play. Both our information was based on own experience. So I looked up a datamine, turned out I was correct. She then got mad about me looking it up and telling her in the first place - I just thought she could also benefit from knowing it.", "We've had a few conversations about it but didn't find a good middle ground, hence me asking the internet :T \nAfter today, we talked about it again and found a semi solution for 50% of the cases. Sometimes I get hyperfocussed on something interesting she tells me and I then google the topic to find out even more. She assumed that I then also fact check her and got mad about it in the past, while I just want to find as much as possible because what she said was so interesting. We found a way for me to communicate about that better.", "She's not more wrong than other people! Most people aren't 100% on facts. She's very smart but she can be over confident in her knowledge.", "She's not less accurate than the average person and she's very smart, but she's also used to always being right and can therefore be a bit overconfident on topics she doesn't know much about", "I shouldn't dare to tell her to double check anything, she takes that as a personal attack. So I just do it myself when I need it. Which is still an issue.", "Op is a woman.", "Or it could have absolutely nothing to do with gender and have everything to do with her specifically.", "OP should have just looked it up to begin with, rather than asking girlfriend about it and *then* looking it up.", "She said she googled it a while ago and google didn't say how much to use. I was scared of breaking my new second-hand laundry machine, so I googled it anyway. She was wrong, so I was glad I googled it. FYI it's half a cup. She'd also never done it herself, her only source was that she had googled it a while ago.", "She's not wrong more often than other people. I was also just thinking aloud. And as soon as I pondered about how to clean it, she was like 'I googled that a while ago!' so I heard her out. I still wanted to double check that whatever I was gonna do wouldn't harm the machine though. And I looked up the one part she didn't know. That's all I did, I trusted the rest of her information.", "I always do, it doesn't really help. I also prefer to have an external source in a case like this. If the machine did break, I didn't want her or me to be responsible, I wanted the random website to be at fault. I'm really good at breaking stuff accidentally and I was nervous about cleaning my very dirty second hand laundry machine.", "Yes I do it with everyone, it's not been an issue before. It's not about trust to me. I'm a careful person, I want to do things right and I always want to learn more. I never doubt her when it comes to personal stuff, but when it comes to facts, I just don't rely on myself or my friends and family, I want reliable, neutral, professional information.", "I'm going to go NAH. As soon as I read your example I knew that there would be a million different answers on Google and yes I fact checked it and I can tell you the first three link came up with 500g, a cup, and a scoop with a capful of vinegar. \n\nIt's soda so you're hardly going to do any damage short of putting in several kilos and your GF was right that Google didn't tell her how much to use (or at least didn't provide the information needed to make a decision). This sounds like you communicate differently and your instant assumption she's wrong and instinct to go look at random sources on the internet instead probably doesn't make her feel great. This isn't about AHs, especially because we're talking about soda here, it's about how a particular behaviour is impacting on each other and working to find a happier ground between you.", "Google can give different results depending on what words are, and sometimes even the order of the words, used.\n\nSo, you could acknowledge this, but at the same time, do it in a way that blames Google, not your GF's choice of words to use.", "Why was OP asking girlfriend in the first place, if she was planning to look up the information anyway?", "But you know she doesn't like being constantly checked, so YWBTA to keep doing that to her (in her presence, anyway, I make no judgement about doing it in a different room if you can't avoid the urge).\n\nPart of interacting with people is interacting with them. Basically: you're not dating google you're dating a person, it's okay if she doesn't want to micromanage checked all the time.", "That's awesome! Pat yourselves on the back for a communication win.\n\nYou seem more diligent about vetting information than she is, and this may be a fallout of that difference between y'all. \n\nI strongly suspect that when you fact check something she says, she gets a feeling that you don't trust her. That's a feeling nobody likes. It's not an easy question or problem to navigate. Being more transparent about what you're doing can at least remove the number of times she thinks you're fact checking her when you're not. With it happening less often, that should help.\n\nI really don't think anyone is an AH here, maybe just soft TA for her for this actual instance. If she's very frequently wrong, as I recall you mentioning in the OP, I do think encouraging both of y'all to verify information before sharing it with others would be healthy for your relationship (and her, IMO). She will feel like you trust her more if her declarative statements are proven right more, because you *will* trust her more. But again, that's a sensitive discussion so handle with care: nobody likes being called ignorant.", "I know most people aren't 100% on facts,  but you did say she is wrong very often, which certainly paints her as being wrong more than other people. She may be smart, but perhaps being smart is part of how she identifies, so when she is wrong it feels like an attack on who she is. There should be no shame in saying you aren't sure about something.", "Is she like, not clicking any actual pages? Is it possible she's relying entirely on that little pop-up box that Google sometimes has, that directly answers the question - and she's *never* actually clicking on anything? Because that would explain why she thought Google \"had no answers\".\n\nI ask this because I have done something similar. I have quoted stats that I saw in that pop-up, then gone back, actually clicked on the site, and realised the stats as presented in the pop-up were slightly misleading when you take the whole study into account.", "[deleted]", "Sure fully reasonable enough. But again it falls onto did you ask her, no was she \"right\".\n\nIf you daily ask questions, she answers, and you ignore her and google anyways... its a much different situation than her just talking to talk and you researching on your own.", "Why did you ask her about it at all?  Why didn't you just look it up and go clean the washer?", "[removed]", "I do this, too. I have opened my mouth to argue with someone (or started typing) and then gone \"Hang on. Before I say this, let me check I'm actually right\". My partner laughs at me, because when we're arguing about something (mostly light-hearted arguments) and I suddenly go dead silent... it's always because I'm googling it. And sometimes, that ends with me going \"... Fuck. I'm totally wrong\".", "I didn't assume she was wrong, I just wanted to be sure. And funnily enough I found different amounts haha, but that's not the point, I just wanted to make sure that 'too much' wouldn't be an issue and I wanted to make sure that soda was the best option in this case. We've had similar situations about things like game mechanics, medication side effects, prices of certain things etc. Whenever I feel like we disagree on what we think a fact is, I don't want to argue about it, I just want to look it up and find out. If I happen to find that she was incorrect, I want to tell her so we both learn something. If she was right I also tell her so we both learn something - but then she's just annoyed that I still had to check even though she was right. I want people to fact check me, because I want to learn if I was wrong.", "YTA\n\nWhy do you bother asking her if you're not gonna take her answer and google it anyway? Do you not see how annoying it would be to her? The way you act is like her input is never trustworthy enough. That gets insulting over time. \n\nIf I were her I'd be like \"if my answers always need to be fact checked, don't bother asking me in the first place\". And then I would answer to you every time you ask me a question \"idk just google it I guess\". \n\nNo one likes to take time to help someone then see that person disregard it entirely times and times again.", "Fact checking is her term for it. I never intend to 'fact check', I just prefer to look things up myself.", "Of course! It's just that she got mad as soon as I grabbed my phone. She said she couldn't find it and that's perfectly fine, but then please let me look it up myself too. Even if I also can't find it, at least I've tried everything then. And usually I can.", "She wasn't. The girlfriend wasn't able to answer what amount, so OP went ahead and looked for the amount. OP has clarified that obviously if the gf had offered the actual quantity, that would not have been \"fact checked\"", "Please explain.", "It's not daily, more like monthly. I only google when I want more information than she can give like this time, or when I'm very scared of doing it wrong and want to double/triple check - which was also the case this time.", "However, if you are going to see something yourself, don't bring it up to others first. People don't want to spend their time helping others and then feel undervalued.", "But this makes you the arbiter of what's correct. You get to decide and then tell her whether she's right or wrong. Not everyone wants every moment to be a learning moment, especially when it's your partner. \n\nJust because you want to be fact checked doesn't mean she does. She had chosen a course of action but you had to \"fact check\" and then said she was wrong except she wasn't as you fully acknowledge. Ultimately you can keep insisting your way is the right way and see how that impacts on your relationship or you can work with your gf to find a way forward.", "Isn't that what most people do? Asking someone who's there in the moment is faster than pulling out your phone. We've only lived in the era of instant fact checking for the last 20ish years, it's normal to just ask for information. If someone gives you an answer that seems off your baseline, then you check another source. There's certain questions that you might google first, \"what's the GDP/c of Qatar?\" is not something you expect girlfriend to just know off the top of her head. \n\n\"How much baking soda do you put in a washing machine?\" is more likely in someone's stored knowledge. If the answer is \"last time I used half a cup, but I don't think there's a specific measurement\", that's perhaps worthy of a fact check. There likely is a specific recommendation based on washing machine capacity, soil level, etc and the gf just didn't read the manual (who does?) but google likely has the answer to that question.", "Because her answer was incomplete. I asked how much to use, she said google didn't say how much. If she'd said an amount I'd have believed her.", "I guess my question to you is... if you prefer to look things up yourself anyway, why even bother asking her first? Just go straight to the source of information that you trust. \n\nI don't actually think you're doing anything wrong here, nor are you an AH but I can see how this could be annoying to your girlfriend as well. Might make things more peaceful to just go straight to google.", "Lol that\u2019s literally the same thing? *Why* do you want to look it up yourself? Because you want accuracy. \n\nI\u2019ve never had someone be offended by my supplemental research when I don\u2019t come back correcting their answers but instead giving further info contextualizing or posing it as a debate or whatever.", "my husband is a better google than i am OP. i want specific information and google likes to give me not what i want to know. my husband says my questions are sometimes too specific.", "probably not an asshole then but do be careful around this. It certainly does suck to be ignored and depending on job/other relations you may take the brunt of what society does to belittle some people. \n\nI have certainly taken a step back from asking and offering advice as I am a very inquisitive person but it mostly comes off as me being a narcissistic ass.", "Well I'm okay with not telling her te outcome, I just wanted to be extra sure I wasn't going to ruin my laundry machine. And I don't trust my own judgement any more than anyone elses, I look it up.", "YTA for how you're going about this, not the fact that you Google things. You're coming across as baiting her so you can prove how wrong she is. Just stop it, stop trying to use being factually correct to feel superior in the end. You even said she asked you to just look things up for yourself. Why is that? Does that not give you some clue about how you're making her feel?", "My gf is not better or worse than me, but she googles very differently and gets different results. When she cannot find something, I usually can and vice versa. It's only an issue in one direction though.", "I feel like you're shifting the goalposts and missing my point. First it was she's frequently wrong and she was wrong here, then you acknowledge that she wasn't wrong here but you just like to look stuff up so you can tell her if it was right or not, and now it's you're often wrong. All of which is irrelevant because my point is you're doing something which is hurting her and undermining your relationship. You can continue to do it and defend it with a moving array of excuses and see how that works out or you can work with your girlfriend to find a way to work through these moments.", "She never said to look it up myself? She said SHE looked it up herself a while ago. She'd never done it herself. \n\nWhen we talked longer about it she said that if I plan on looking things up anyways, I shouldn't ask her at all and just look it up in secret so she doesn't find out. I didn't think much about it, I just thought aloud like \"hmm, how to do this\". I just wanted to make sure. It wasn't about her, it was just about not breaking my new laundry machine. I don't bait her. I hate situations like this. And I want to be able to share struggles without having to hide whenever I ask another source than her memory.", "But you keep repeating this same pattern, with the same result. Don't you want it to be different? Then you have to be willing to look at the situation and recognize where you might be wrong and then make a change. And I believe you have to be willing to do that if you're here asking. It's hard not to get defensive, I know. But if this situation keeps happening and neither of you are ok with it, change. She's asking you to solve it, she's telling you she wants you to stop doing this. But you refuse. If that's the case, you are the one making a conscious decision to prolong strife. That makes you TA.", "If you want to Google it, don't ask her for the answer first.", "Don't ask her questions like that. Just look up the information you need and do what you gotta do.

I think it is great that you are open to the possibility that you could be wrong about something, and verify your information.

You're putting a lot of importance into being right and it's going to damage your relationship. Facts matter, but at some point, people get tired of being corrected, makes others feel stupid and like they're not good enough. It's a thing I'm working on because it pushes others away. YTA.

I often know more about some topics than he does and visa versa.

We\u2019ve discussed this many times in our marriage.

Or you might want to Google that later because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got the details quite right.

If you know that your girlfriend feel slighted when you ask her a question and you fact check her answer in real time or she volunteers information and you fact check her answer then stop doing it in front of her. Control yourself enough to look it up later when she\u2019s not there. And don\u2019t tell her that you looked it up.
