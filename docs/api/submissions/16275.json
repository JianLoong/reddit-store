Once we\u2019d talked about it, it also helped me in how I phrased my questioning, because a lot of the time that was what the issue was for both of us.

I totally understand that. Maybe having a deep conversation on the importance of vetting information that we accept as true would be beneficial to y'all and get y'all on the same page.

If you are more short or just \"That's wrong!\" with your answers that is probably why it bothers her.", "NTA  if she is giving you wrong info then that's on her.

It was medication I was about to take and we both need to know this for our studies, so it never occured to me to stay silent about it.", "Thanks. I never use the word 'wrong'. I just usually say 'Im gonna look it up just to be sure' or I don't say anything and just grab my phone after the conversation. I usually don't even think about it. Or I say 'I wanna know more' or 'I want to be 100% certain so I'm gonna ask another 3 sources, just because I'm scared of making a mistake'.", "I google a lot in general, it has nothing to do with her specifically. Usually, I google stuff because I'm interested to learn more about whatever topic people told me about, not because I don't believe them. Or I google because it's easier to learn complex information by reading/seeing pictures than through audible conversation. I am more likely to google stuff the more interested I am.", "She's not wrong more often than anyone else! She's very smart, she's just also stubborn and she doesn't double check things as often as I do. I usually believe her, but usually I only double check when I either want even more context or when I feel like her information sounds shaky.\n\nFor example, we also had a disagreement about a mechanic in a game we both play. Both our information was based on own experience. So I looked up a datamine, turned out I was correct. She then got mad about me looking it up and telling her in the first place - I just thought she could also benefit from knowing it.", "We've had a few conversations about it but didn't find a good middle ground, hence me asking the internet :T \nAfter today, we talked about it again and found a semi solution for 50% of the cases. Sometimes I get hyperfocussed on something interesting she tells me and I then google the topic to find out even more. She assumed that I then also fact check her and got mad about it in the past, while I just want to find as much as possible because what she said was so interesting. We found a way for me to communicate about that better.", "She's not more wrong than other people! Most people aren't 100% on facts. She's very smart but she can be over confident in her knowledge.", "She's not less accurate than the average person and she's very smart, but she's also used to always being right and can therefore be a bit overconfident on topics she doesn't know much about", "I shouldn't dare to tell her to double check anything, she takes that as a personal attack. So I just do it myself when I need it. Which is still an issue.", "Op is a woman.", "Or it could have absolutely nothing to do with gender and have everything to do with her specifically.", "OP should have just looked it up to begin with, rather than asking girlfriend about it and *then* looking it up.", "She said she googled it a while ago and google didn't say how much to use. I was scared of breaking my new second-hand laundry machine, so I googled it anyway. She was wrong, so I was glad I googled it. FYI it's half a cup. She'd also never done it herself, her only source was that she had googled it a while ago.", "She's not wrong more often than other people. I was also just thinking aloud. And as soon as I pondered about how to clean it, she was like 'I googled that a while ago!' so I heard her out. I still wanted to double check that whatever I was gonna do wouldn't harm the machine though. And I looked up the one part she didn't know. That's all I did, I trusted the rest of her information.", "I always do, it doesn't really help. I also prefer to have an external source in a case like this. If the machine did break, I didn't want her or me to be responsible, I wanted the random website to be at fault. I'm really good at breaking stuff accidentally and I was nervous about cleaning my very dirty second hand laundry machine.", "Yes I do it with everyone, it's not been an issue before. It's not about trust to me. I'm a careful person, I want to do things right and I always want to learn more. I never doubt her when it comes to personal stuff, but when it comes to facts, I just don't rely on myself or my friends and family, I want reliable, neutral, professional information.", "I'm going to go NAH. As soon as I read your example I knew that there would be a million different answers on Google and yes I fact checked it and I can tell you the first three link came up with 500g, a cup, and a scoop with a capful of vinegar. \n\nIt's soda so you're hardly going to do any damage short of putting in several kilos and your GF was right that Google didn't tell her how much to use (or at least didn't provide the information needed to make a decision). This sounds like you communicate differently and your instant assumption she's wrong and instinct to go look at random sources on the internet instead probably doesn't make her feel great. This isn't about AHs, especially because we're talking about soda here, it's about how a particular behaviour is impacting on each other and working to find a happier ground between you.", "Google can give different results depending on what words are, and sometimes even the order of the words, used.\n\nSo, you could acknowledge this, but at the same time, do it in a way that blames Google, not your GF's choice of words to use.", "Why was OP asking girlfriend in the first place, if she was planning to look up the information anyway?", "But you know she doesn't like being constantly checked, so YWBTA to keep doing that to her (in her presence, anyway, I make no judgement about doing it in a different room if you can't avoid the urge).\n\nPart of interacting with people is interacting with them. Basically: you're not dating google you're dating a person, it's okay if she doesn't want to micromanage checked all the time.", "That's awesome! Pat yourselves on the back for a communication win.\n\nYou seem more diligent about vetting information than she is, and this may be a fallout of that difference between y'all. \n\nI strongly suspect that when you fact check something she says, she gets a feeling that you don't trust her. That's a feeling nobody likes. It's not an easy question or problem to navigate. Being more transparent about what you're doing can at least remove the number of times she thinks you're fact checking her when you're not. With it happening less often, that should help.\n\nI really don't think anyone is an AH here, maybe just soft TA for her for this actual instance. If she's very frequently wrong, as I recall you mentioning in the OP, I do think encouraging both of y'all to verify information before sharing it with others would be healthy for your relationship (and her, IMO). She will feel like you trust her more if her declarative statements are proven right more, because you *will* trust her more. But again, that's a sensitive discussion so handle with care: nobody likes being called ignorant.", "I know most people aren't 100% on facts,  but you did say she is wrong very often, which certainly paints her as being wrong more than other people. She may be smart, but perhaps being smart is part of how she identifies, so when she is wrong it feels like an attack on who she is. There should be no shame in saying you aren't sure about something.", "Is she like, not clicking any actual pages? Is it possible she's relying entirely on that little pop-up box that Google sometimes has, that directly answers the question - and she's *never* actually clicking on anything? Because that would explain why she thought Google \"had no answers\".\n\nI ask this because I have done something similar. I have quoted stats that I saw in that pop-up, then gone back, actually clicked on the site, and realised the stats as presented in the pop-up were slightly misleading when you take the whole study into account.", "Internalized misogyny", "Sure fully reasonable enough. But again it falls onto did you ask her, no was she \"right\".\n\nIf you daily ask questions, she answers, and you ignore her and google anyways... its a much different situation than her just talking to talk and you researching on your own.", "Why did you ask her about it at all?  Why didn't you just look it up and go clean the washer?", "[removed]", "I do this, too. I have opened my mouth to argue with someone (or started typing) and then gone \"Hang on. Before I say this, let me check I'm actually right\". My partner laughs at me, because when we're arguing about something (mostly light-hearted arguments) and I suddenly go dead silent... it's always because I'm googling it. And sometimes, that ends with me going \"... Fuck. I'm totally wrong\".", "I didn't assume she was wrong, I just wanted to be sure. And funnily enough I found different amounts haha, but that's not the point, I just wanted to make sure that 'too much' wouldn't be an issue and I wanted to make sure that soda was the best option in this case. We've had similar situations about things like game mechanics, medication side effects, prices of certain things etc. Whenever I feel like we disagree on what we think a fact is, I don't want to argue about it, I just want to look it up and find out. If I happen to find that she was incorrect, I want to tell her so we both learn something. If she was right I also tell her so we both learn something - but then she's just annoyed that I still had to check even though she was right. I want people to fact check me, because I want to learn if I was wrong.", "YTA\n\nWhy do you bother asking her if you're not gonna take her answer and google it anyway? Do you not see how annoying it would be to her? The way you act is like her input is never trustworthy enough. That gets insulting over time. \n\nIf I were her I'd be like \"if my answers always need to be fact checked, don't bother asking me in the first place\". And then I would answer to you every time you ask me a question \"idk just google it I guess\". \n\nNo one likes to take time to help someone then see that person disregard it entirely times and times again.", "Fact checking is her term for it. I never intend to 'fact check', I just prefer to look things up myself.", "Of course! It's just that she got mad as soon as I grabbed my phone. She said she couldn't find it and that's perfectly fine, but then please let me look it up myself too. Even if I also can't find it, at least I've tried everything then. And usually I can.", "She wasn't. The girlfriend wasn't able to answer what amount, so OP went ahead and looked for the amount. OP has clarified that obviously if the gf had offered the actual quantity, that would not have been \"fact checked\"", "Please explain.", "It's not daily, more like monthly. I only google when I want more information than she can give like this time, or when I'm very scared of doing it wrong and want to double/triple check - which was also the case this time.", "However, if you are going to see something yourself, don't bring it up to others first. People don't want to spend their time helping others and then feel undervalued.", "But this makes you the arbiter of what's correct. You get to decide and then tell her whether she's right or wrong. Not everyone wants every moment to be a learning moment, especially when it's your partner. \n\nJust because you want to be fact checked doesn't mean she does. She had chosen a course of action but you had to \"fact check\" and then said she was wrong except she wasn't as you fully acknowledge. Ultimately you can keep insisting your way is the right way and see how that impacts on your relationship or you can work with your gf to find a way forward.", "Isn't that what most people do? Asking someone who's there in the moment is faster than pulling out your phone. We've only lived in the era of instant fact checking for the last 20ish years, it's normal to just ask for information. If someone gives you an answer that seems off your baseline, then you check another source. There's certain questions that you might google first, \"what's the GDP/c of Qatar?\" is not something you expect girlfriend to just know off the top of her head. \n\n\"How much baking soda do you put in a washing machine?\" is more likely in someone's stored knowledge. If the answer is \"last time I used half a cup, but I don't think there's a specific measurement\", that's perhaps worthy of a fact check. There likely is a specific recommendation based on washing machine capacity, soil level, etc and the gf just didn't read the manual (who does?) but google likely has the answer to that question.", "Because her answer was incomplete. I asked how much to use, she said google didn't say how much. If she'd said an amount I'd have believed her.", "I guess my question to you is... if you prefer to look things up yourself anyway, why even bother asking her first? Just go straight to the source of information that you trust. \n\nI don't actually think you're doing anything wrong here, nor are you an AH but I can see how this could be annoying to your girlfriend as well. Might make things more peaceful to just go straight to google.", "Lol that\u2019s literally the same thing? *Why* do you want to look it up yourself? Because you want accuracy. \n\nI\u2019ve never had someone be offended by my supplemental research when I don\u2019t come back correcting their answers but instead giving further info contextualizing or posing it as a debate or whatever.", "my husband is a better google than i am OP. i want specific information and google likes to give me not what i want to know. my husband says my questions are sometimes too specific.", "probably not an asshole then but do be careful around this. It certainly does suck to be ignored and depending on job/other relations you may take the brunt of what society does to belittle some people. \n\nI have certainly taken a step back from asking and offering advice as I am a very inquisitive person but it mostly comes off as me being a narcissistic ass.", "Well I'm okay with not telling her te outcome, I just wanted to be extra sure I wasn't going to ruin my laundry machine. And I don't trust my own judgement any more than anyone elses, I look it up.", "YTA for how you're going about this, not the fact that you Google things. You're coming across as baiting her so you can prove how wrong she is. Just stop it, stop trying to use being factually correct to feel superior in the end. You even said she asked you to just look things up for yourself. Why is that? Does that not give you some clue about how you're making her feel?", "My gf is not better or worse than me, but she googles very differently and gets different results. When she cannot find something, I usually can and vice versa. It's only an issue in one direction though.", "I feel like you're shifting the goalposts and missing my point. First it was she's frequently wrong and she was wrong here, then you acknowledge that she wasn't wrong here but you just like to look stuff up so you can tell her if it was right or not, and now it's you're often wrong. All of which is irrelevant because my point is you're doing something which is hurting her and undermining your relationship. You can continue to do it and defend it with a moving array of excuses and see how that works out or you can work with your girlfriend to find a way to work through these moments.", "She never said to look it up myself? She said SHE looked it up herself a while ago. She'd never done it herself. \n\nWhen we talked longer about it she said that if I plan on looking things up anyways, I shouldn't ask her at all and just look it up in secret so she doesn't find out. I didn't think much about it, I just thought aloud like \"hmm, how to do this\". I just wanted to make sure. It wasn't about her, it was just about not breaking my new laundry machine. I don't bait her. I hate situations like this. And I want to be able to share struggles without having to hide whenever I ask another source than her memory.", "But you keep repeating this same pattern, with the same result. Don't you want it to be different? Then you have to be willing to look at the situation and recognize where you might be wrong and then make a change. And I believe you have to be willing to do that if you're here asking. It's hard not to get defensive, I know. But if this situation keeps happening and neither of you are ok with it, change. She's asking you to solve it, she's telling you she wants you to stop doing this. But you refuse. If that's the case, you are the one making a conscious decision to prolong strife. That makes you TA.", "If you want to Google it, don't ask her for the answer first.", "Don't ask her questions like that. Just look up the information you need and do what you gotta do.

I think it is great that you are open to the possibility that you could be wrong about something, and verify your information.

The next day she said 'I googled it, and you were right'. Maybe she meant it as a compliment, but to me it just showed that I wasted my time; if you don't trust my answer, don't come to me in the first place or at least don't share that you thought my advice was bad and had to double check it!", "You are making her feel like shit.", "Why do you ask her then?

You're putting a lot of importance into being right and it's going to damage your relationship. Facts matter, but at some point, people get tired of being corrected, makes others feel stupid and like they're not good enough. It's a thing I'm working on because it pushes others away. YTA. Continue to focus on the important thing,  being right, and you'll see people leave.", "INFO: That depends on how you correct her.

I often know more about some topics than he does and visa versa. But when it\u2019s a topic i *do* objectively know more about, it drives me nuts and is really insulting when he tries to argue with me or fact check me.

We\u2019ve discussed this many times in our marriage.

I'm looking up silly stuff all the time. And I like to excitedly share my findings. It's also happened that I'd be like 'did you know that this and this?' and then she disagrees and I go like 'but I just read it right here' and then I double check and then if it turns out my information was right, she's still annoyed.", "I have this habit of thinking aloud.

I understand the need to have correct information. That is important, but if you constantly fact checked people, it can come across as you doubting their intelligence. Like I said, it hurt and costed me my relationship. I just couldn't handle constantly having someone pull up Google when I'm talking to them to verify what I said. In this case, she was wrong and should have accepted that, but I can totally understand why it would hurt her feelings too.", "Perhaps she assumes her partner isnt incapable of looking something up in a way that's actually useful for the task at hand?", "Seems like a pretty useless and petty AH to keep around then, IMO", "Ofc, I checked 3 other sources after", "I used to be indecisive, now I'm not sure", "In this kind of scenario I think it's reasonable to say \"Thank you for looking into it; I'd like to find out how much is too much so I don't bork the washing machine\".

We both look up what the other says sometimes when it just sounds wrong. But we do try to verbally recognize that we could be the one that\u2019s wrong or that it\u2019s an interesting tidbit that we want to know more about. But we should all recognize that google is an algorithm and isn\u2019t always the necessarily correct information that gets put to the top but often the most clicked that works with the cookies already in your computer/device. Definitely not saying it\u2019s completely unreliable, just that it is something to keep in mind as you scroll through it. I do recommend using google scholar. You can almost always get the abstract (the summary) for free and depending on the actual source, you may be able to access the full article also for free or you could directly email the author and sometimes they\u2019ll send it for free where the magazine wouldn\u2019t. And if you\u2019re a student, your school account may grant you access regardless (my school had access to the major ones like jstor and a few others). But my professors always told us to keep those things in mind when researching for a paper", "[removed]", "Keep the answer to yourself unless she\u2019s interested in it too. That\u2019s annoying. I say this as someone who often looks stuff up with my boyfriend and in general likes to look stuff up.", "NTA\n\nAt first glance I'd say she's bonkers to even think she can demand you have to 'believe' her statements at all, especially if she failed to provide accurate info previously.\n\nTo handle this more constructively I'd suggest asking her to send you a relevant source in these situations in the future, which should be a trivial thing to do if she was just looking the thing up herself. \n\n-\n\n\nI'd like to also suggest there might be an issue not with 'believing' in information but with how she communicates it?\n\nLike in your example about 'how much soda to use for the washing machine', apparently she told you 'google wont tell you the amount', which is obviously nonsense. \n\nPerhaps she wanted to express something else actually, along the lines of 'the first five entries on google gave five different amounts'. \n\nBut even saying that it would still be badly communicated because it still wouldnt have been a useful-complete answer to your problem. That would have been something like 'the entries all say something different, like from one to three cups.' That would accurately sum up her own findings in a way that explains her pov to you. \n\nImo it's on her to communicate more clearly but also to reconsider what she regards as 'looking this up' because in your situation I'd like to know more than just 'well...seems to vary', like whether that's just some home remedy which will work at every dosage between 'enough soda to nuke bacteria' and 'not so much soda that the resulting base will be strong enough to fuck up something in the machine', or whether it strongly depends on water hardness or whatever.", "Then do so and stop treating her like she\u2019s stupid- which is what you\u2019re doing.", "INFO : Are you asking her and then looking it up after she answers?", "Bot, comment stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136fske/comment/jiofhka/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).", "Good point. Not entirely relevant to what I was saying. But it is a good point for the OP.", "If you\u2019re consistently googling things anyway after asking someone, why do you waste their time and insult their recall by asking in the first place and then telling them that you\u2019re going to google it anyway?", "How does she react if you explain to her that her answers are incomplete? Imo that's a perfectly fine complaint. \n\nWhat she's doing is like telling someone to give you '*that* thing' from the toolbox and then getting mad at you for not magically knowing she meant the telephone pliers.", "But you're clearly doing this a lot. It's the fact that this happens constantly that is aggravating to her. And you don't seem to believe her when she says she did not see how much to use on google.", "Yeah, but her girlfriend already asked op not to \"fact check\" her in front of her. I don't think the issue is with the fact checking so much as that the girlfriend asked op not to do something that bothers her and op keeps doing it.", "It depends honestly. So I guess in short, sometimes, yes. He has ADHD as well as we both know how prevalent false memories or misremembered situations can be. Additionally so when we both have ADHD. And some of the times I double check him, I do it obviously and others I think of it later while I\u2019m in the bathroom or something and look it up so I guess he may not know about those if it weren\u2019t for the fact that I know he likes having interesting tidbits so I usually let him know even with those times. IMO people need to recognize how prevalent misinformation is and accept the possibility that they could be the one spreading it and realize that being fact checked across multiple sources isn\u2019t a personal attack, but merely something that needs to be done because the wrong information is everywhere", "It\u2019s fine to quietly look it up. It\u2019s the comments to her that are probably irritating her. You\u2019ll be fine to look stuff up to your hearts content with a little more tact.", "GF said she already looked it up- but  somehow neglected to get the quantity & ratios, which is like 85% of the task. If someone told me they already got info, then relayed a half assed incomplete set of instructions, I\u2019d def google it. There\u2019s no cruelty- just one person who thinks half info should be enough, and apparently asking for complete instructions from an adult is making the partner feel bad. The gf is being a brat.", "Lol have you ever used Google? There will always be an answer as to how much to use so someone saying otherwise either didn't actually Google it, or was too lazy to search past the first result. Either way, OP is NTA", "It happens slightly less than once a month. In the beginning it happened twice in a row because I didn't know it would bother her. I do it a lot less now, so now it's only an issue when I really need my information for real life applications. And I believed that she did not find it, I just didn't believe that it would be impossible to find. In any case I wanted to try.", "[removed]", "She got mad just because she noticed me grabbing my phone though.", "There were multiple different answers. Some very different from each other. So GF could well have meant 'google doesn't provide a clear answer'", "Then OP can simply stop asking her! She said already that her gf wants her to stop. So instead she keeps at it knowing it's against her partner's wishes, putting her on the spot, then just looking the info up herself anyway. It's so childish the way they're acting like the only possible way to do this every time is involving the gf. It isn't, OP is just weirdly hung up on taking this route.", "OP doesn\u2019t say that they ever asked the gf about the soda thing though. From the wording, I personally interpreted it as the girlfriend saying they couldn\u2019t find the amount online unprompted so OP then went to double check. Even if prompted, there\u2019s a huge difference in saying \u201cI couldn\u2019t find it\u201d versus confidently saying \u201c2 cups\u201d. If OP had directly asked and gotten an actual measurement and then looked it up, your comment would make sense. But outside of that, it just doesn\u2019t hold up in everyday society to expect people to not look further into an \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I fully understand that my relationship is very well possibly an outlier and that maybe most people do see questioning your information as a personal attack rather than a fact of generations of misinformation, but I can\u2019t think of a valid reason someone would be upset that you looked something up because they couldn\u2019t find your answer", "I'm trying, but I also want to get the correct information. I don't want to break my appliances. So then I have to chiose between my relationship and factual information, which is not a choice I want to make. She doesn't try to meet me halfway either with this. I'm fine with not doing it with 'her' stuff, but if I am in trouble if things go wrong, I want them to not go wrong.", "That's a bot account.\n\nThey're copying comments and replying to others.", "[removed]", "Don't over think it my man. The people responding in this thread are doing mental gymnastics. Fact is your girlfriend is being immature and the problem has gotten to the point of wanting to do something about it, you are not TA, you are asking for outside opinions. This seems like a compatibility and communication thing. Sure you can change your behavior to avoid this issue, but the fact is you shouldn't really have to because there is nothing wrong with your behavior, it is healthy, and suppressing such healthy behavior is in fact not healthy. You want to be honest and not have a strained relationship over such a basic thing. Only change your behavior as a temporary means if you have a plan as to how to improve communication in your relationship. The situation sounds pretty annoying. When someone acts as your gf is acting, it might be about something deeper. People say don't get into a relationship if you want to fix a person, but perhaps she needs some kind of therapy here, otherwise perhaps she is just too immature for you. Can you attribute her behavior to something deeper? Is there another way of getting to the bottom of it? Imo you shouldn't have to sacrifice such an essential thing as being able to do research to improve your life/solve problems. What a silly expectation.\n\n\nThe people saying \"well, then don't ask her\", are really being unrealistic. Are you supposed to not ask her anything? Are you supposed to not have an inquisitive mind which wants to fill in the blanks and collaboratively arrive to better solutions? The whole premise sounds silly. Your gf is being very defensive and unreasonable.", "The point here is it\u2019s fine to get the correct info but announcing she is wrong can come off as you are baiting her to prove her wrong lol", "You are trying to argue that if you listen to her and her incorrect information that you will ruin something in your home. But she herself is asking you to simply not ask her. So then... don't. This is you trying to make it seem like there's an either/or situation here but there isn't. There's a \"respect her wishes by not asking her for information which you can just readily Google from the start and take care of your home while leaving her tf out of it\" situation. Otherwise you are looking for arguments and discontent. Decide now who you want to be in this scenario."]}
