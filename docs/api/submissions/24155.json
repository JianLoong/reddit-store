They simply could not fathom a person not having ANY faith or religion, they expected everyone in my country to be Christians and asked about it over and over, I did not give them the satisfaction though and stuck to my atheism every time. They did not ask any deeper questions because their kids were there.\n\nOne the other hand, Christians are not much more accommodating either.

Things are a little less strict now than when I first started working in some respects regarding the discussion of politics, religion, and sexuality, but in your case it proves how it can lead to awkwardness if it's in a work setting. \n\nEither way, he should actually be appreciative of your emotional labour to educate him. It's not only religious differences between you, though. \n\nFor example, in some cultures, it's an expectation on the speaker to ensure that the listener understands. In other cultures, it's the listener's responsibility to understand. This is just an example, but it illustrates the differences in expectations across cultures... I'd apologize for his feeling how he does but also remind him that he was the one asking, so you assumed he genuinely wanted answers. And encourage him to say something sooner next time if it's too detailed.", "NTA. He\u2019s being confronted with an an atheist with morals, something many religious people raised in sheltered communities. It\u2019s a large part of his identity and that\u2019s being shaken right now. But that is not your fault or responsibility.\n\n\u201cI was making him question Islam\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t MAKE him do anything. You just answered questions. You can tell him that you empathize with the idea of struggling with identity and faith, but that wasn\u2019t your intent. \n\nYou can choose to be there for him as he goes through this if you want, but make it clear that you will not accept blame for him not having enough faith in his own religion.", "NTA, you were honest and he asked the questions. It sounds like he wasn't ready for the conversation but that's his problem. His personal shit is not your fault.", "Wow. NTA.\n\nI am firm in what I believe, but make concerted efforts to respect everyone's agency in deciding their beliefs and their truth. If someone asks questions about my beliefs, I answer in-depth. If I ask someone about their beliefs, I appreciate in-depth answers. I find it fascinating to exchange these ideas-- being able to question these things and share our thoughts is a fundamentally human interaction. No other species on Earth is able to communicate in this way.\n\nAll this to say that I think you were actually being a good human! It is not your fault and never will be if your answers made some questions or concerns he had about the Islamic faith feel more... real and justified.\n\nHowever, knowing how organized religions function (especially Judeo-Christian ones), many of them thrive off fears like what your friend is experiencing to keep people's minds from questioning. Often not to the benefit of the believer, too.\n\nI pray your friend finds clarity in what he believes and finds comfort in and acceptance for whatever that may be. The world is confusing, we don't need to pile shame on ourselves for seeking answers and explanations just because a priest, pastor, rabbi, imam, or any religious teacher told us to.", "Nta", "Its allways good to make people question islam. NTA", "NTA. People believe in different things and that's ok. I'm an atheist, but my husband is a Christian. We have discussions about religion, but we're both secure enough in our beliefs that our discussions are more like healthy debates, rather than trying to sway the other's way of thinking. \n\nThe fact that your friend is questioning his belief isn't necessarily a bad thing. That happens more than you think. I think he's more upset at the fact that he thought that his faith was strong enough, that it cannot be shaken. And that's normal. Everyone's faith is challenged at some point, sometimes by external factors, other times by their own brains. \n\nOP, you did nothing wrong. Your friend will realise that at some point. Right now he's questioning a lot of things and he needs to find those answers on his own.", "NTA.\n\nWhat he believes is his choice, not yours and his crisis of faith is something he has to sort out.", "NTA - you were just asking the questions he posed, if he is questioning his beliefs that is something for him to deal with and wouldn't have happened if he was already secure in his faith or had learnt about other trains of belief before.\n\nAs a Christian who's had deep conversation with atheists on our differing beliefs, I find them to be interesting and kinda fun provided both people are respectful", "NTA\n\n**Dude:** *Asks questions about religion*\n\n**OP:** *Answers all of them patiently and truthfully.*\n\n**Dude:** (*With confused pikachu face)* You are horrible, I am now questioning my religion because of you.\n\nDoes he even realize how stupid that sounds in his head, let alone saying it out loud?", "Yea i was raised in a southern baptist church.  But ooo boy when i started asking questions youd have thought the devil entered my soul, and grabbed hold.\n\neveryone from the youth counselors to the preacher man himself was ready to \"exercise my demons\".(this part must be read with a full on southern accent too lol)\n\nIm atheist now btw.  i guess that demon just liked my residency and now has tenants rights  hahah", "His 'Faith being weak' isn't on him. It's on the religious belief that's build on bad reasoning. There is no need to worsen his mental crisis by blaming him to be raised with a faulty worldview.\nTelling a person who's raised in a religious environment that their 'Faith being weak is on them' is basically telling them the enternal punishment that will follow for their disbelief if they don't get their shit together is their fault. There are plenty of other ways to be critical of the belief system without triggering a mental crisis that has been conditioned by their upbringing.", "NTA Does he think Atheists can control people's thoughts?  If you answering questions eloquently has him questioning his religion then there was definitely doubt there before he spoke to you. This isn't your fault ans if he keeps trying to blame you,  cut him off.", "NTA\nCheck your boundaries with this guy. He is having a weirdly strong reaction to your perspective. Now he's making it your job to guide him through his existential crisis. Why is YOUR spiritual view an issue with him, that you should give time and attention?\n\nHe is considering you as a potential romantic interest and trying to find a loophole in his own thinking that would still allow that. You are already uncomfortable with his intrusion into your time and your spirituality. Firmer boundaries are needed.", "NTA.  If your answers make him question his religion that's a him problem, not a you problem.", "ugh darwin hits this one hard huh? NTA cant be that faithful if he got tumbling over that or he sees finally beyond the veil. and is scared to be left out of the truth of the world. no creator just some lucky coincidence", "NTA. He is, for blaming his crisis of faith on a woman. Gave him the fruit of the tree of knowledge did you? Bad, bad Eve!  /s", "NTA. This is an internal struggle people have with their faith. To blame you and try to guilt you because his parents will be mad at him for questioning his own faith is one weird guilt trip. What is he trying to accomplish by telling you this? You're not going to magically have faith in a religion because of this.\n\n I would be wary of spending more one on one time with this guy. He needs to figure out his faith on his own, Further discussion isn't going to make him feel any better or less guilty.", "NTA I find it funny how people's faith can dissolve if they just think about it for a bit", "He asked, you answered. Not your problem what he does with those answers later. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If his faith is too weak to handle contact with the diversity of people who believe otherwise (or not at all) then that is entirely his problem.", "That\u2019s not necessarily what will happen so it is not a good idea to say that.", "I'm sure it was an autocorrect error, but when people use exErcise instead of exOrcise, I picture a demon being taken for a long walk. Possibly on a leash.", "Jumping jacks. Demons hate doing jumping jacks.", "Can confirm."]}
