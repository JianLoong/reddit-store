It's not only religious differences between you, though. \n\nFor example, in some cultures, it's an expectation on the speaker to ensure that the listener understands. In other cultures, it's the listener's responsibility to understand. This is just an example, but it illustrates the differences in expectations across cultures...

Often not to the benefit of the believer, too.\n\nI pray your friend finds clarity in what he believes and finds comfort in and acceptance for whatever that may be.

That happens more than you think. I think he's more upset at the fact that he thought that his faith was strong enough, that it cannot be shaken. And that's normal. Everyone's faith is challenged at some point, sometimes by external factors, other times by their own brains. \n\nOP, you did nothing wrong. Your friend will realise that at some point.

The guy seems to have lashed out because he's worried about what his relatives will think if he loses the faith. Plenty of countries where apostasy will get you murdered.\n\n\nThe real problem here is building a culture where refusing to acknowledge the designated deity, is a crime akin to murder.

There are also many other doctrines in Islam which demand of Muslims to pretend living in perfection rather than showing flaws, because this would weaken iman. You're not supposed to confess sins to anyone, no matter how bad you feel, as you aren't allowed to reveal what Allah has hidden: the goal is to make sin less seen, as this is believed to weaken iman.

It sounds like he didn\u2019t really respect your identity as an atheist and wanted to call to question everything you belief in.
