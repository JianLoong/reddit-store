They simply could not fathom a person not having ANY faith or religion, they expected everyone in my country to be Christians and asked about it over and over, I did not give them the satisfaction though and stuck to my atheism every time. They did not ask any deeper questions because their kids were there.\n\nOne the other hand, Christians are not much more accommodating either.

Things are a little less strict now than when I first started working in some respects regarding the discussion of politics, religion, and sexuality, but in your case it proves how it can lead to awkwardness if it's in a work setting. \n\nEither way, he should actually be appreciative of your emotional labour to educate him. It's not only religious differences between you, though. \n\nFor example, in some cultures, it's an expectation on the speaker to ensure that the listener understands. In other cultures, it's the listener's responsibility to understand. This is just an example, but it illustrates the differences in expectations across cultures... I'd apologize for his feeling how he does but also remind him that he was the one asking, so you assumed he genuinely wanted answers. And encourage him to say something sooner next time if it's too detailed.", "NTA. He\u2019s being confronted with an an atheist with morals, something many religious people raised in sheltered communities. It\u2019s a large part of his identity and that\u2019s being shaken right now. But that is not your fault or responsibility.\n\n\u201cI was making him question Islam\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t MAKE him do anything. You just answered questions. You can tell him that you empathize with the idea of struggling with identity and faith, but that wasn\u2019t your intent. \n\nYou can choose to be there for him as he goes through this if you want, but make it clear that you will not accept blame for him not having enough faith in his own religion.", "NTA, you were honest and he asked the questions. It sounds like he wasn't ready for the conversation but that's his problem. His personal shit is not your fault.", "Wow. NTA.\n\nI am firm in what I believe, but make concerted efforts to respect everyone's agency in deciding their beliefs and their truth. If someone asks questions about my beliefs, I answer in-depth. If I ask someone about their beliefs, I appreciate in-depth answers. I find it fascinating to exchange these ideas-- being able to question these things and share our thoughts is a fundamentally human interaction. No other species on Earth is able to communicate in this way.\n\nAll this to say that I think you were actually being a good human! It is not your fault and never will be if your answers made some questions or concerns he had about the Islamic faith feel more... real and justified.\n\nHowever, knowing how organized religions function (especially Judeo-Christian ones), many of them thrive off fears like what your friend is experiencing to keep people's minds from questioning. Often not to the benefit of the believer, too.\n\nI pray your friend finds clarity in what he believes and finds comfort in and acceptance for whatever that may be. The world is confusing, we don't need to pile shame on ourselves for seeking answers and explanations just because a priest, pastor, rabbi, imam, or any religious teacher told us to."]}
