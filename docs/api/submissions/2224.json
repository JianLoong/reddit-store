If you were still conscious and dealing with a dizzy spell then there is no reason at all to barge into the bathroom. He thinks he has better judgement about YOU and YOUR health then you do! Sorry you had to deal with that and continue to deal with this situation, good luck op", "NTA- if he was worried he could have yelled down for a parent the fact you said no many times is a clear indicate you did not want his help he walked in on you and handled you while you did not consent to that behaviour. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFO: how old are you?", "Info: do you have a history of dizzy spells? Have you ever been seriously injured from these spells? Did you tell him that you would rather he get your parents?", "I mean if someone sounded so out of it they couldn't really speak to me coherently, and I could hear that they were in the shower, I would consider that a life threatening emergency. How would he know you were safely sitting down? And standing up alone to get out of the shower would have been even riskier, since that's when you're most likely to faint...", "NTA\n\nTell him and your parents that no means no.\n\nYour parents should be on your side. It is sad that they are not.", "NTA he IS a pervert. Why is he monitoring your shower habits? Are your parents trying to set you up with him? Wtf. This is so many levels of fucked up.", "NTA\n\nAsk him why he didn\u2019t call for your parents. He might not have had perverted reasons for it but to keep going after giving explicit \u2018STOPS\u2019 is wrong on so many levels.", "Need info! You could of been worse off than you are implying, he could also be a perv. You state this is a regular thing, but you didn\u2019t explain the extent of your dizzy spells and how they affect you. Are you always resentful to help like you give the impression here? It was wrong of him to barge in for sure, but there is very important information missing here.", "NTA, he invaded your privacy, if he was that concerned he should have asked a family member to check on you", "NTA He violated your clearly stated boundaries. Could he not have gotten your Mother to assist you if needed? Bellowed for someone else? I would be pissed too.", "NTA.  He violated your boundaries big time.  He was worried because you didn't sound good but could he not have asked someone else to help you??  This didn't happen to anyone else so their opinions don't matter.  Seems pervy to me.", "Info: How old are you even? And how did he even come in? I'd assume you lock the door if you're on a visit with family friends. Why didn't he call your parents when they were all having breakfast? How exactly did this whole situation even play out??? Like he grabbed your wet, naked ass and yanked you out of the shower while you yelled at him to go away? And no one else came to see what was going on?\n\nI'm sorry but the way this is written, this seems like a fake story, made up to rile commenters up.", "NTA. You said no, you asked not to be touched, and he violated those boundaries anyway. It\u2019s a clear overstep under the guise of trying to be helpful, as if it was out of concern, he would have called for your parents instead of ignoring the fact that you asked him both not to come in and not to touch you. If you were my kid and this scenario took place, I\u2019d be pissed and we\u2019d be leaving wherever immediately.", "Girl/guy go home and away from these people", "NTA\nWhy on earth did he not called your parents????", "NTA,\n He should have called for your family to help you out. \nAnd that your own family doesn't see this as inappropriate is just \ud83e\udd2f", "NTA- You told him to go away several times and he did the exact opposite. Also his line \"I just won't help you next time\" is ridiculous. He shouldn't have \"helped\" this time if you didn't even ask for it and to call you childish? For having a normal response to someone invading your privacy after being asked MULTIPLE times not to? Yikes. Sounds like you hit the nail on the head there calling him a pervert and he's just embarrassed by his own behavior so wants to make it seem like he's not the creep here.", "NTA - couldn't the hero good Samaritan, idk, find a woman to help the naked woman instead of busting in? Also this sounds a bit odd, is there a history here?", "NTA\n\nYou made it clear you did not want help, and he barged in anyways knowing full well that you were naked and vulnerable.\n\nIf he was genuinely concerned about your safety, he should have run downstairs to get your Mom.", "NTA I truly don't understand why anyone is siding with him he clearly violated your privacy and autonomy I think he sounds like a disrespectful pervert too. I'm so sorry that no one is standing up for you. You told him to leave you alone and his response was to charge in and force his will on you while you're naked and screaming for him to stop!! Wtf that sounds like the police could have been called I am appalled and I am so sorry this happened to you! You're not an AH and the nerve of him saying next time I won't help you when that was what you explicitly asked him to do!!", "NTA\n\nHe is a pervert! Who does that!?! He should have at least called your parents. He behaved inappropriately", "NTA you said no and he continued. stop talking to your family until they realize that and if they ask what\u2019s wrong tell them that they fell short of supporting their child.", "NAH. after reading several comments from OP saying they are prone to dizzy spells, I'm going with no AH. I probably would have done the same thing if a loved one sounds rough on the other end of the door. I feel like he was very worried and wanted to make sure OP was safe. OP stated that the house they were in is huge soo that's probably why the parents didn't her her yelling at Nic. If the house is that big, how long would it have taken Nic to run and get a parent and get back to the bathroom with the parent? OP could have already passed out and busted her head open in that time.", "NTA. IMHO this was assault, probably wouldn\u2019t rise to SA but it\u2019s still a form of assault. You told him not to touch you and he did. The fact you were naked makes him a pervert.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your family was there, you were obviously conscious as you were verbally communicating  \u2018no need to come in\u2019.   He then naturally comes in, you\u2019re obviously naked in the shower he COMES IN TO THE SHOWER AND TOUCHES YOU TO TAKE YOU OUT OF IT.\n\nNope, this isn\u2019t normal by any stretch.  Why is he basically breaking the door down because you\u2019re late for breakfast? This is weird. Trust your gut, talk to your parents that this was hinky. \n\nAny concern he felt could have been allayed by going to tell your parents.  Since you were speaking through the door it\u2019s not like he thought you fell, hit your head or passed out.", "Info are you are woman or a man?", "Exactly. I wouldn't have wanted my parents to come in either but it would've been better if he at least made an effort to call them instead.\n\nI'm 25", "Yes, I do. I've only hurt myself once but now I sit down as soon as I start feeling dizzy until it stops. No, I just kept telling him to go away.", "Not all bathrooms have locks, and some locks are easy to open from the outside using a coin.", "Based on this account, there are two possibilities: Nic is a pervert who assaulted OP for no reason and their parents are okay with it, or OP wasn\u2019t as okay as they think they were (or they sounded REAL bad). \n\nI know which one I would be betting on.", "I'm 25. I never lock the door when I shower because I get dizzy a lot and nobody else would've used the bathroom I was in anyway. I don't know why he never called my parents as I would've preferred that. He turned the shower off and then used a towel to touch me so he could get me out of the shower and into my room. I don't think they heard me yelling at him as they have a huge house and I would like to think my dad would've come if he heard.", "That's how I know he wasn't being a good Samaritan. A vindictive jab like that is not something a helpful person would do. \n\nOP you are NTA and I hope your \"family\" comes around because holy shit. They took the side of a pervert creep.", "Where does it say OP is a woman?", "It\u2019s weird he continued to engage after she showed she was safe though. Why\u2019d he touch her and try to help her out of the shower after seeing she was safely seated? Wouldn\u2019t it be more dangerous to try and make a dizzy person stand back up?", "Agreed. \n\nA loved one fell in her bathroom once - she told those coming to check on her she was fine for HOURS (neighbor came to check on her). It wasn't until he forced his way in that it was realized she was in very very bad shape. She was in ICU for 2 weeks following the event.\n\nMaybe the family friend had a similar experience. Maybe OP sounded really bad. \n\nSometimes in life we have judgement calls to make and when it comes to health issues its best to air on the side of caution. Before saying he assaulted her, I suspect there is a LOT more to this story then is being conveyed.", "she told him not to touch her when she was, presumably, naked in the shower. That automatically makes him an asshole, especially since her family was in the house at the time.\n\nThat alone makes him the asshole, imo. NTA.", "Why does it matter?", "Irrelevant", "I'm a woman.", "You do have grounds to press charges for sexual assault. He pulled you out of the shower when you were naked and protesting. That is totally inappropriate and the fact that your parents refuse to see that is concerning. Even if you were laying there bleeding if you say no to him touching you and are aware of the situation he has no grounds to touch you.", "Sitting is good! I always do this when I get dizzy because the one time I didn\u2019t I ended up with a terrible concussion. So dumb. What he did wasn\u2019t right. You should talk with your family about what your needs are when you get a dizzy spell. So this doesn\u2019t happen again. You should also let Nic know that no means no and if he is worried about you he should get someone from the family. I wouldn\u2019t want a family friend getting me out of the shower in such a venerable position.", "Either way he could\u2019ve gotten her mum", "Unless OP was actively dying, it doesn\u2019t make sense for him to barge in himself (especially since they told him not to). It shouldn\u2019t take long to get their parents", "No judgement, but if you \"get dizzy a lot\" then you: 1) should be checked out by a doctor for medical issues that would cause vasovagal syncope, POTS, or other similar problems, because that's not at all normal (and I say this as someone who has a disability that causes dizziness), and 2) should be using a shower chair to mitigate your fall risk.", "> I would like to think my dad would've come if he heard.\n\nSo why did your parents side with this man after you told them that you yelled at him for barging into the shower?\n\nOr have you only called him a pervert during breakfast without actually explaining what exactly he did. Giving him the opportunity to sping the story, making it sound like he thought you've gotten hurt or something. If you have a medical issue that everyone knows of it would at least paint a somewhat coherent picture of how your parents came to agree with this guy if they never got to hear the details.\n\nAre you in shock perhaps? And haven't really grasped what actually happened? Because in that case I'd seriously advise you to talk to your parents again and try to explain again what really happened, the way you did here. Because not calling someone else and ignoring your protest sounds like this man used your issues as an excuse to basically assault you. That doesn't just make him an asshole it makes him something worse.\n\nAnd excuse me for being highly critical about your depiction of this situation, but it's so utterly simple to whip up people into a frenzy in this forum and I get suspicious if I don't see a way of fitting the pieces of a story together that makes sense.", "It didn't specify but contextually isn't that implied? Why else would you call a dude a pervert for going into the bathroom unless he's specifically gay in which case they'd probably mention it.", "Because I presume Nic is a man (it sounds like a male name). If the OP is the same sex, I wouldn't call Nic perverted but he should understand boundaries. OP maybe sounded really bad and NiC made a rash decision.\n\nIf OP is a woman then Nic should have definitely first called out for her parents.\n\nOP is calling Nic a pervert, so is Nic gay or bi? Or is the OP a woman? Is important information.\n\nBoundaries are important in either case but information is important as well. Else accusing someones character who simply helped without anything to back it up is a big red flag on the OP.", "In that case he should have definitely called for your parents. If no one responded, I'd understand him getting worried and coming in. But just walking in was a major NO NO. \n\nNTA.\n\nEdit: I asked because I found your parents reaction very strange. Either way boundaries should always be respected.", "Do this. Do this. Do this.", "How would they know that without checking?", "It also seemed to imply OP is a minor, but a comment clarified OP is 25. Ultimately, I think the post is missing crucial details.", "Opening the bathroom door and putting your hands on an unwilling naked individual is pervert behaviour. Especially when that person is obviously coherent enough to tell them to stop", "She\u2019s able to communicate in full sentences, and speak in a way that is understood. Even if walking in was necessary, as soon as he saw OP was safely seated on the floor he should have left. Instead he grabbed her and forced her out of the shower", "Definitely, that's why I also asked. Like it sounds almost like OP has a history of this behavior to make them act this way.", "Lol no one broke any doors. OP doesn't lock doors as she is prone to dizzy spells. \n\nEdit you changed the comment. So yes, I agree he should have first called for her parents so they could handle the situation.", "Yeah, I edited the comment as soon as I posted bc I misspoke. It\u2019s still pervert behaviour. At the very least he could have left as soon as he saw that OP was safe, instead of engaging further. He saw she was seated on the floor"]}
