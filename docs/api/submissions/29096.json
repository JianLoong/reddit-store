It started when he would come over frequently to help us put things up in our house. While I've always been incredibly grateful for his help, I don't like that he never lets us know when he's coming or even which day (despite express requests for him to let us know). One weekend when my husband and I went away, my FIL went over to our house without permission or any prior discussion to work on our garden. \n\nIt just feels rude, and makes for awkward situations. So far he's entered our house when my husband and I have still been in bed, when I've just got out of the shower in a towel, or when we've got other plans. There have been times I've walked into a room thinking the noise within is my husband, and it's my FIL. He never seemed to acknowledge any fault in what he was doing either. \n\nNaturally all this was very frustrating and upsetting to me, and I spoke to my husband. To start with he thought I was overreacting, because I don't think any of it had actually bothered him yet. Of course when it started to he suddenly understood my point of view, and said several times he'd get his dad alone and talk to him. That's apparently because his dad can be easily offended and my husband still wants his help around the house. My reply was basically that I'd welcome his help and don't want to offend him, but he's overstepping our boundaries and I'm getting tired of not feeling like I can relax in my house in case someone bursts in. \n\nThe last straw came the other day. I was home alone and my husband texted to ask if his father could come over to grab his work boots from our garden. He wouldn't need to come in or anything. Before I even had a chance to respond to that, my FIL came into the house. He hadn't even bothered to wait until he'd been given permission, let alone respected my opinion on the matter.\n\nI politely but firmly told my FIL how I was feeling, and mentioned that if this continued, I'd feel uncomfortable with him having a key to our house and would like him to give it back.

He was provided many opportunity to address this and did not....he is TA.  Oddly, he 'wants to keep good relations so you both can benefit from your FIL free labor....yikes. He's motivated to get what he can for free instead of building a healthy relationship living so close to one another. \n\nIt is creepy to be in your home and the door becomes unlocked without you knowing who or what is occurring.

I get that the FIL is doing things when he can and has the momentum but yeah he needs to have permission to enter someone\u2019s home. \n\nOP, I would consider upgrading the locks to electronic ones that can be monitored from your phone, you can even give FIL a code that allows him into the house , some system  allow you put hours on the code where he can only use for noon to 1pm on Saturday, that way you have more control on when he has access.", "NTA.\n\nAn emergency key is not permission to invade your privacy.", "NTA, FIL being a massive fucking baby isn\u2019t your problem.

He clearly didn't set boundaries with his father and left you in an awkward situation. If he thinks you overreacted then he can only blame himself for creating that scenario.", "NTA \nYour FIL was stomping all over boundaries and didn't care and your husband wasn't firm enough.  I will be moving close to my in-law's soon and they won't be getting a key. I have been talking about my MIL fence since my partner and I discussed moving closer.  My home will be a fortress against my MIL because she hasn't any boundaries.

It\u2019s his dads problem if he\u2019s gonna be sullen and act like a child about it. Honestly, I personally wouldn\u2019t ask him to help around anymore.

Show up unannounced and just walk into their house at random day/hours.  See how he'd react, then ask why it's OK for him to do that to you.", "NTA, it appears that either husband had been sufficiently afraid to talk to his father that he was letting it continue, or FIL was ignoring what he was told.  Given that FIL was supposed to be not coming in and came in anyway, I wonder if he was hoping to catch you coming out of the shower or something.   (He may not be a creep - could be just someone lacking self awareness and with boundary issues, or perhaps your husband never spoke to him about it at all.)  But, without knowing the details of what was said, it's perfectly fine to tell someone you're uncomfortable with them coming in uninvited and without announcing themselves or knocking, if your FIL is mad because he thinks he should be freely able to barge in on you walking around the house naked, or on you and your husband, for example, having sex on the living room floor, that's his problem not yours and if the subject comes up, you might put it that way.", "Can you get an electronic keypad lock and give him his own code? You can control when it is active so he can't come in unannounced but still has emergency access.", "NTA, you did the right thing and confronted him directly.  Problem solved.", "Your FIL overreacted. You did not.", "Just change the door to a keypad lock. Claim you wanted to upgrade in case you forgot your key. Keypad locks can be pretty nice to be honest. \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA - but I think you did slightly overreact & maybe could have handled it a little better. Of course, I don't know the whole situation, but possibly talking to your MIL first would have been better. You could have said, \"It would be nice if FIL gave us a heads-up when he is coming over, sometimes you're asleep, showering, etc and it surprises you.\" Let her relate to hearing an unknown man in her house and let her approach FIL and maybe hint that he should give heads-up if he is stopping by. Make it not sound personal, just startling. They may be more comfortable with family coming and going and just say how you are not used to that \"yet\" (even if you mean long term). It will definitely be helpful down the road to have them keep a key on-hand and keep that relationship solid.", "NTA. Entering your property without permission is trespassing, even if your FIL has a key.\n\nYou've tried the nice approach, but FIL is still breaking your boundary.

It's unfortunate this was not a priority to him. Guess the free labor was more important.", "NTA. You have a husband problem more than a FIL problem, though. \n\nYour husband would rather you be upset and uncomfortable in your own home than possibly upset his dad. He cares more about his dad\u2019s feelings than yours. Or, his dad makes life unpleasant when he doesn\u2019t get his way, and he\u2019d rather \u201cnot rock the boat\u201d than stand up to him.

He would have been more sullen. :-) I have been married to my husband for 27 years. I still dont walk in their house without knocking.

After all he's already walked in when you just got out of the shower.", "NTA.  A key doesn't mean an open invitation.", "NTA.

Most brands will show attempts using the code when it's disabled, so you'll know if they try to come over when you haven't requested they do.\n\nWhile we haven't given anyone our code, that's exactly what we would do if needed, as a one off situation.", "NTA - This isn't really a big deal, it's a personal preference thing. I have friends that have the same relationship with their parents, they just come on over whenever. It's a social upbringing thing and it's pretty obvious you and your husband were raised differently and just discovered that! No issues here, you got the thing handled. \n\nBut it's your FIL you know, like he's just been coming over and working on things, he probably feels like he's doing an act of love/service for his son and DIL.

You have every right to privacy in your own home. \n\nYou also made it clear to your husband how uncomfortable it was making you feel on multiple occassions, and he said multiple times he would talk to his dad about it. He obviously didn't. This is not your fault, it's your husbands fault for not addressing it with his dad when you've told him multiple times how it's upsetting you and making you u co.fortable, and despite saying multiple times he'd talk to his dad, he didn't. \n\nYour husband is to blame for how this went down. \nIf he'd have spoken to him when he had the chance, it wouldn't have come to this. \n\nYou have a right to privacy and respect in your own home. You have the right to take a shower and walk in a towel to your bedroom without being afraid your FIL is somewhere in the house. \nYou have the right to tell someone you're busy and they can't come round right now. \nYou have the right to a lay in in bed, or even have sex with your husband at any time of day in any room of your house without worrying your FIL will walk in. \n\nObviously his dad is going to be hurt and even a bit embarrassed possibly. I would either talk to him yourself, or get your husband to, or together, and explain to him that you gave them a key for emergencies, so that if they needed to get in the house in an emergency they could, or if you lost your keys or got locked out they had a spare one. However you're not comfortable with them using it to walk in unannounced at any time. You like your privacy, and don't want to have to worry about walking from the shower in a towel, or if you and your husband are being intimate.

Just reiterate you're happy for him to co.e over at times but you need your privacy and just need advanced warning rather than just walking in unexpected. \n\nA similar thing happened with my dad once, and my sister in law was in the shower when my dad let himself in their house for some trivial reason I can't remember. We didn't know at the time but he had early dementia, so he didn't really think about the privacy or polite thing to do, so we had to take the key off him and just me and mum have it. It was only a bit later we found out he had dementia. Not saying that's what's causing your fil to do it. Just that you're not being unreasonable for wanting privacy. We still have keys to my brothers house but we still k ock the door when we are going over there. Only time we use the key is if they are out and we are asked to go there to watch my nephews or something.", "Hoe old is FIL?", "Maybe he wants to catch you nude and alone... NTA. Change the locks instead of asking for the key back", "NTA\n\nDon't ask for the key, he may have copies.

This feels so familiar. My FIL was doing the same thing. He's also quite easily offended. We bought our house from my FIL, and not only did he only take the things he wanted and leave us to get rid of all of his literal junk, but he was coming over to use our garage and not tell us. Our garage was full of his 'projects' and we couldn't even get our cars in there! He would come in the house to use the bathroom or get a drink. After being caught in the shower once and coming out in a towel another time when my husband wasn't home, I flipped. I told my husband that we are not his storage facility or hobby space. If we couldn't fit our cars in the garage by the end of the week, I was throwing his stuff out. And if FIL didn't give notice of his coming, I would kick him out under threat of police if I had to. \n\nThere are other underlying issues and incidents, but now FIL calls to let me know he's coming/ here (literally sometimes calls from my driveway lol), and while he works on things in our garage, we can fit our cars in and he cleans up after himself. It's the best I'll get and things are better now, so I'll take it even if it's not 100 percent what I wanted.\n\nOP, NTA. As Reddit loves to say, you don't just have a FIL problem, you have a husband problem! He never should have let it get to this point. Your husband doesn't like how you handled it?
