Bit of a long post.\n Some important background: I (22F) live in an apartment with 2 other girls (we will call them A and D). Their bedrooms are on the other side of the apt, but I have to walk through the living room to get to my bedroom & share a wall with the tv.\n\nMy one roommate, D, is having a guy over tonight to watch movies in the living room. Today she knocked on my door and asked to talk. The conversation went like this:\n\nD: \u201cso he will be here around 4. Id appreciate it if you\u2019d either leave for the day until he leaves, or make sure you have everything in your room so you don\u2019t have to leave while he\u2019s here\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cI can definitely leave and go to the library around 1 or 2. How long do you think he will be here for? I can stay out as long as possible.\u201d\n\nD: \u201cI don\u2019t know yet, but I don\u2019t want to feel rushed\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cWell, I have to be in bed by 11:30, I have lab at 8 and an exam tomorrow.\u201d\n\nD: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if he will be gone by then.\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cIf he\u2019s not, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll be quick and just go straight to my room. You won\u2019t even know I\u2019m there.\u201d\n\nD: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want that. What if we are doing things upstairs. It\u2019d be awkward if you just came up during that.\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cI\u2019ll be loud when I\u2019m opening the door, and I\u2019ll text you before I leave.\u201d\n\nD: \u201cWell, then just stay here. Then you\u2019re in your room and you don\u2019t have to worry about being in bed late.\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cThe walls are thin. I really struggle to study with noise. I\u2019m okay leaving, but I can\u2019t stay out past 11:30.\u201d\n\nD: \u201cYou\u2019re being rude. This isn\u2019t a big request. This is my apartment too.\u201d\n\nMore ensued, but I ended up telling her that I\u2019d leave at 2, but I\u2019d be back when I was back and she would just have to cope. She stormed downstairs and slammed her door. My other roommate texted me and said I was being unreasonable. \n\nI feel like I wasn\u2019t fully in the wrong here; maybe petty at the end, but not unreasonable. With that said, I sometimes can be stubborn. \nSo, Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1695573369, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16r25fz/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_that_she_was_being/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
