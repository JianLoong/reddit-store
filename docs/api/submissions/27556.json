Today she knocked on my door and asked to talk. The conversation went like this:\n\nD: \u201cso he will be here around 4.

Then you\u2019re in your room and you don\u2019t have to worry about being in bed late.\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cThe walls are thin. I really struggle to study with noise.

This is my apartment too.\u201d\n\nMore ensued, but I ended up telling her that I\u2019d leave at 2, but I\u2019d be back when I was back and she would just have to cope. She stormed downstairs and slammed her door. My other roommate texted me and said I was being unreasonable. \n\nI feel like I wasn\u2019t fully in the wrong here; maybe petty at the end, but not unreasonable.
