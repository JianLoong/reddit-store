My brother Jason has a girlfriend, Carmen, who has a daughter, Lia (5), with her ex, who does not see Lia. Jason and Carmen have been together 6 months, and don't live together. I met Carmen first at a dinner when they had been together 4 months, and the next time I saw her was when she and Jason came to my house with Lia.\n\nLia and Tory were playing together in my drawing room, I was watching them, Carmen was in the kitchen with my mother preparing tea. After a while, I heard the girls raising their voices, so I went over to see what happened, only to find Tory tearing up and Lia looking very angry. I asked the girls what had gone on, and after a fair bit of untangling I figured out that Lia had told Tory that they were cousins, and Tory had said that they weren't. This upset Lia who kept trying to make Tory admit she was wrong, which Tory would not do. Lia kept insisting they were cousins, but Tory said they can't be because Jason isn't Lia's dad. Both girls were demanding I settle the debate, so I just said that no, they aren't cousins, but that doesn't mean they can't be friends, and someday if Jason becomes Lia's dad, they might be cousins. Lia immediately burst into tears. I called Carmen back into the room and explained what happened.\n\nCarmen insisted I should have told the girls Lia was right to make her feel validated and part of the family. I argued that I wasn't going to lie to my daughter to force a narrative. This was the second time I was meeting Carmen, and the first time the girls met, did she really expect me to gaslight my daughter for the sake of what she told hers?\n\nAt this point Lia was inconsolable, so Carmen and Jason left. Jason has since told me he thinks I owe Carmen an apology. He said even though Tory was right, it would have been easier to spare Lia's feelings and explain the situation to Tory later. I told him I wasn't going to lie to my daughter, and teach her that you adapt the truth to fit the situation. I was happy to stand my ground on this until Jason said Carmen is refusing to see the family (our parents sided with me) because of this, since she takes it as proof we don't like her. I don't think I was the AH for taking my daughter's side, but since Carmen is making such a scene, I'm beginning to think maybe this is a bigger deal than I realise and maybe I messed up.", "created_utc": 1670199669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcqx4c/aita_for_taking_my_daughters_side_when_she_said/", "score": 1381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you're spot on--Lia and Tory are *not* cousins.  But that shouldn't stop them from being friends.  No, you handled the situation quite right.", "NTA. You handled it very well. It's very weird for your brother's girlfriend to be pushing for the girls to be \"cousins\" so early in the relationship. They don't even live together.", "NTA. I think you handled the situation as best you could and even told the girls one day they could be. Carmen is playing a dangerous game with her daughter's feelings having only been with a man for 6 months and pushing the family narrative she's the one setting her daughter up for heartache and you were just being honest in an awkward situation. The fact that Carmen is now refusing to see everyone just proves that she's immature and pushy.", "NTA. 6 months is not long enough to date to be serious enough where your brother is now dad to her and your kids are cousins. Sounds like the girlfriend is desperate to make a nuclear family asap", "**NTA**\n\nI'd say you handled the situation with the girls beautifully and thoughtfully by reassuring them that they could be friends and didn't NEED to be cousins, and by adding that they might one day be cousins still. That was lovely! \n\nCarmen, on the other hand, seems to be wearing a full outfit made of red flags. Your approach was sensible, warm, and thoughtful. Hers is irrational, demanding, and based on telling small children untruths and insisting as an adult on seeing things in exaggerated terms of black and white, and nothing but. Yikes.\n\nContrary to what Carmen is suggesting, there is a vast world of nuance between calling someone \"family\" or their children \"cousins\" when they have been dating your brother for a mere 6 months and you've only ever met them twice, and \"not liking them\". You can like someone very much and even consider them a dear friend . . . that doesn't make them your cousin, or sister-in-law, or any sort of family.  That she is demanding that her child be literally called by a familial term this fast, and when she's only dating been dating your brother a matter of months is worrisome. It's not even healthy for her daughter to be teaching her to call people \"family\" this fast. It skews a young child's understanding of what family is. \n\nI'm very sorry. This sounds exhausting. But you handled it really kindly, and you are certainly NTA.", "NTA this is factually true", "NTA. You don\u2019t seem to have been rude to the child but gentle explained reality.

They don\u2019t have that \u201cthink before you speak\u201d mentality that adults have. Sure, yeah, sometimes kids say the wildest things, but it\u2019s important that we let them be a kid. \n\nWhen you tell a kid to lie to someone, you\u2019re teaching them that it\u2019s okay to lie. If you want your child to learn the difference between right and wrong, you can\u2019t conflict them this way. \n\nNTA.", "NTA they are absolutely not cousins and have just met. The mom probably told her daughter they were cousins and that's why it was brought up in the first place. They haven't even been together long so it seems she's trying to push her way into the family but it's backfiring big time. They can be friends they don't have to be cousins.", "NTA You explained the situation to the children appropriately. They weren't cousin's now but they may be in the future. How your brother's girlfriend's daughter got the idea they were cousin's remains to be seen? However, if Carmen is offended by the truth, not much you can do about it.", "NTA. \n\n\nJason needs to take a hard look at how early his girlfriend is comfortable with bossing around your family and lying to her daughter about relationships. It seems like she\u2019s trying to force strong bonds way too early. Maybe it\u2019s innocent, maybe she\u2019s trying to make your brother feel trapped. Either way it\u2019s very strange behavior and should be nipped in the bud early.", "NTA. If Tory had referred to Lia as her cousin on her own, that would have been fine but you can't lie to her to try to force a relationship on her. I grew up with my aunt's step granddaughter spending a lot of time at their house. I was too young to understand the actual family relationship so since we were around the same age, I took to referring to her as my cousin because it was just easier and that was the kind of relationship we had. I'm honestly closer to her as an adult than most of my actual cousins, but no one ever forced that relationship on us or tried to convince me we were really related. Both families need to let the girls' relationship or friendship evolve naturally and let them forge their own relationship if they want one.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s true, they aren\u2019t cousins.", "NTA\n\nI hate it when parents bend reality to appease children.", "NTA. You handled it well. No, they are not cousins but that doesn't mean things can't change. Forcing an inaccurate narrative is unnecessary.", "Info: were they telling Lia they were cousins, or was this a conclusion she drew on her own?", "NTA. While there are many ways I could imagine this having maybe gone marginally better or different, you\u2019re never morally obligated to lie to your child. Period. \n\nCarmen sounds insecure about her budding relationship but that really isn\u2019t your problem unless you want it to be.", "Nta.

Carmen and Jason asked you to lie to Lia. A mother asked you to lie to her child. Unless there are EXTREME circumstances, this isn't normal. (Extreme circumstances are explained by parents). Carmen and Jason also expected you to deny your own child, for the sake of Lia. This is beyond troublesome.\n\nI wouldn't  have Lia or Carmen in my home.
