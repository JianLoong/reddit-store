My brother Jason has a girlfriend, Carmen, who has a daughter, Lia (5), with her ex, who does not see Lia. Jason and Carmen have been together 6 months, and don't live together. I met Carmen first at a dinner when they had been together 4 months, and the next time I saw her was when she and Jason came to my house with Lia.\n\nLia and Tory were playing together in my drawing room, I was watching them, Carmen was in the kitchen with my mother preparing tea. After a while, I heard the girls raising their voices, so I went over to see what happened, only to find Tory tearing up and Lia looking very angry. I asked the girls what had gone on, and after a fair bit of untangling I figured out that Lia had told Tory that they were cousins, and Tory had said that they weren't. This upset Lia who kept trying to make Tory admit she was wrong, which Tory would not do. Lia kept insisting they were cousins, but Tory said they can't be because Jason isn't Lia's dad. Both girls were demanding I settle the debate, so I just said that no, they aren't cousins, but that doesn't mean they can't be friends, and someday if Jason becomes Lia's dad, they might be cousins. Lia immediately burst into tears. I called Carmen back into the room and explained what happened.\n\nCarmen insisted I should have told the girls Lia was right to make her feel validated and part of the family. I argued that I wasn't going to lie to my daughter to force a narrative. This was the second time I was meeting Carmen, and the first time the girls met, did she really expect me to gaslight my daughter for the sake of what she told hers?\n\nAt this point Lia was inconsolable, so Carmen and Jason left. Jason has since told me he thinks I owe Carmen an apology. He said even though Tory was right, it would have been easier to spare Lia's feelings and explain the situation to Tory later. I told him I wasn't going to lie to my daughter, and teach her that you adapt the truth to fit the situation. I was happy to stand my ground on this until Jason said Carmen is refusing to see the family (our parents sided with me) because of this, since she takes it as proof we don't like her. I don't think I was the AH for taking my daughter's side, but since Carmen is making such a scene, I'm beginning to think maybe this is a bigger deal than I realise and maybe I messed up.", "created_utc": 1670199669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcqx4c/aita_for_taking_my_daughters_side_when_she_said/", "score": 770, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's very weird for your brother's girlfriend to be pushing for the girls to be \"cousins\" so early in the relationship. They don't even live together.", "NTA. I think you handled the situation as best you could and even told the girls one day they could be. Carmen is playing a dangerous game with her daughter's feelings having only been with a man for 6 months and pushing the family narrative she's the one setting her daughter up for heartache and you were just being honest in an awkward situation. The fact that Carmen is now refusing to see everyone just proves that she's immature and pushy.", "NTA. 6 months is not long enough to date to be serious enough where your brother is now dad to her and your kids are cousins. Sounds like the girlfriend is desperate to make a nuclear family asap", "**NTA**\n\nI'd say you handled the situation with the girls beautifully and thoughtfully by reassuring them that they could be friends and didn't NEED to be cousins, and by adding that they might one day be cousins still. That was lovely! \n\nCarmen, on the other hand, seems to be wearing a full outfit made of red flags. Your approach was sensible, warm, and thoughtful. Hers is irrational, demanding, and based on telling small children untruths and insisting as an adult on seeing things in exaggerated terms of black and white, and nothing but. Yikes.\n\nContrary to what Carmen is suggesting, there is a vast world of nuance between calling someone \"family\" or their children \"cousins\" when they have been dating your brother for a mere 6 months and you've only ever met them twice, and \"not liking them\". You can like someone very much and even consider them a dear friend . . . that doesn't make them your cousin, or sister-in-law, or any sort of family.  That she is demanding that her child be literally called by a familial term this fast, and when she's only dating been dating your brother a matter of months is worrisome. It's not even healthy for her daughter to be teaching her to call people \"family\" this fast. It skews a young child's understanding of what family is. \n\nI'm very sorry. This sounds exhausting.

Sure, yeah, sometimes kids say the wildest things, but it\u2019s important that we let them be a kid. \n\nWhen you tell a kid to lie to someone, you\u2019re teaching them that it\u2019s okay to lie. If you want your child to learn the difference between right and wrong, you can\u2019t conflict them this way. \n\nNTA.", "NTA they are absolutely not cousins and have just met. The mom probably told her daughter they were cousins and that's why it was brought up in the first place. They haven't even been together long so it seems she's trying to push her way into the family but it's backfiring big time. They can be friends they don't have to be cousins.", "NTA You explained the situation to the children appropriately. They weren't cousin's now but they may be in the future. How your brother's girlfriend's daughter got the idea they were cousin's remains to be seen? However, if Carmen is offended by the truth, not much you can do about it.", "NTA. \n\n\nJason needs to take a hard look at how early his girlfriend is comfortable with bossing around your family and lying to her daughter about relationships. It seems like she\u2019s trying to force strong bonds way too early. Maybe it\u2019s innocent, maybe she\u2019s trying to make your brother feel trapped. Either way it\u2019s very strange behavior and should be nipped in the bud early.", "NTA. If Tory had referred to Lia as her cousin on her own, that would have been fine but you can't lie to her to try to force a relationship on her. I grew up with my aunt's step granddaughter spending a lot of time at their house. I was too young to understand the actual family relationship so since we were around the same age, I took to referring to her as my cousin because it was just easier and that was the kind of relationship we had. I'm honestly closer to her as an adult than most of my actual cousins, but no one ever forced that relationship on us or tried to convince me we were really related. Both families need to let the girls' relationship or friendship evolve naturally and let them forge their own relationship if they want one.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s true, they aren\u2019t cousins.", "NTA\n\nI hate it when parents bend reality to appease children.", "NTA. You handled it well. No, they are not cousins but that doesn't mean things can't change. Forcing an inaccurate narrative is unnecessary.", "Info: were they telling Lia they were cousins, or was this a conclusion she drew on her own?", "NTA. While there are many ways I could imagine this having maybe gone marginally better or different, you\u2019re never morally obligated to lie to your child.

Carmen and Jason also expected you to deny your own child, for the sake of Lia. This is beyond troublesome.\n\nI wouldn't  have Lia or Carmen in my home.

You can\u2019t be close when meeting for the first time, jeez!", ">My brother Jason has ***a girlfriend***\n\nHe doesn't even consider the relationship serious enough to marry her or even propose, a little rich for him to be criticising others for taking it just as seriously as he does.\n\nNTA.", "NTA at all.", "They've been together 6 months and her little girl is crying because she's been told she's a part of a family she doesn't even know. \n\nThis is why you don't introduce kids to partners and families right away. What happens when they split and she never sees her cousins again. Then gets a bunch of new cousins and repeat. \n\nNTA Carmen is fucking with her kids life.", "Nta. But before saying anything I would've consulted with Carmen about this issue. Lia might be dealing with trauma attributed to abandonment issues duento her father not being in the picture and maybe they don't have access to other family and misunderstood the situation or it was explained to her poorly by your brother and her on why they were going to your house.", "NTA\u2026\n\n*But* you could probably have avoided the debacle by telling both kids they are \u201ca little bit wrong, and a little bit right\u2026\u201d, then go on to say exactly what you think the truth is, but with some decorative nuance. \n\nEx: \u201cTory is right that you aren\u2019t cousins by birth, Lia is right that some people make families with the people they choose, so if Jason and Carmen decide to be a family, then you will be cousins\u201d\n\nAt this age, the kids are probably more attached to the idea of winning an argument and/or the label of being right.", "NTA, what happens 6 months from now your brother and his girlfriend break up and Lia has to deal with not being able to see her \"cousin\" anymore. Yes she's upset now but lying to her might make it worse in the long run.", "NTA. That's weird.\nYour *daughter* probably has clothes older than that relationship. If they break up, who has the conversation with her around why cousin Lia isn't coming around anymore? \n\nAs an elementary educator, these little lies lead to kids not trusting their parents. And it's not bad for them to be skeptical, but if they don't trust you then they may not come to you with problems when they should, whether that's small things like dealing with friendship issues or large issues like depression, radicalization, grooming, etc.", "Nta. A girlfriend of 6 months....no her kid is not related to any of you. And they should have been honest with her. If they break up tomorrow does she then stop being cousins?", "They really said to teach your daughter to \u201cadapt the truth to the situation\u201d? Yikes on a cracker. I was already feeling NTA when it was clear their whole vibe was \u201cYes, your child is right, but my child\u2019s feelings matter more,\u201d but that next bit is a terrifying prospect.", "NTA You didn\u2019t take your daughter\u2019s side; you stated the truth in gentle manner!", "NTA - The truth is the truth. You rightfully do not want to lie to your daughter, and it would be a lie. I feel for Lia that she is being told to immediately adopt people she doesn\u2019t know as family, but you are not responsible for the lies her mother tells her.", "i think you're using the term gaslighting a bit too liberally here. just my personal opinion.", "NTA. The girls asked you to settle a specific point. You did that, and were careful not to deliberately hurt anyone with your answer. It is not your fault Lia got fed a falsenarrative, and took it so hard.", "Without even talking it over with her bf the entitlement of these ppl", "In the post you're talking about, OP was the *adoptive mother* of her wife's three children.", "NTA. 6 months together, they don't even live together. What happens when and if Carmen and Jason breaks up and Lia asks why she can't see her cousin anymore?", "NTA. He wants you to apologize for not lying? And if the relationship doesn\u2019t last how is she going to explain to her daughters why she doesn\u2019t see her \u201ccousins\u201d anymore?", "NTA. Your explanation was bang on point, and exactly what I would have said to my kids. You don\u2019t owe anyone an apology.", "NTA - if this strange woman choses to confuse her daughter, that's her business but you should be bullied into lying to your daughter\n\nYour brother is a jerk for going along with this strange narrative.  If over 20 years you choose to include these people in your family, that's different but based on blood, they are nothing to you or your child", "NTA. You did what a great mother would do.", "NTA what is going on in this world?", "NTA OMG the dramah. That must be a passionate young love that they are experiencing. I hope that it works out or Lia will experience some terrible effects if she believes that each new boyfriend is her new father.", "NTA, they have been together 6 months which is zero time at all. My boyfriend didn\u2019t even meet my daughter till we were together for 6 month. I dont know why she even told her daughter they were cousins in the first place, that\u2019s a huge red flag", "Lmfao this was hilarious. you should look up in the dictionary ridiculous. That's a good place to start.", "This is delusional...", "He who is right, is wrong. that should be your name tag on here. They met for the first time. What are you even saying?", "Interesting that it\u2019s ok to invalidate one child\u2019s feelings for another when the truth should be the tie breaker if they are going with some sort of weird narrative where sparing someone\u2019s feelings are all that matter, you can\u2019t spare one persons feelings and stomp on another\u2019s and make it all work out.  I\u2019m not getting into how two kids who have never even met before that night are somehow magically cousins, and the BIl and his girlfriend have only been together 6 mos so there\u2019s a hell of a shot that it won\u2019t last if they are pushing this weird story so early in the relationship, that usually portends a bad outcome.", "Don't underestimate small children. They will absolutely argue about this kind of stuff\n\n***Currently sitting through an argument on why banana bread isn't a fruit***", "Seems like the perfect age for kids to get obstinate about detail like this.", "Can someone link this story", "Can someone link this story", "The truth is the tiebreaker. Love that!", "I've a feeling he's already bleeding out on the ground though.", "NTA and dont you dare apologize for saying something true. They should not of lied to their child then tried to get you on board. It's just plain wrong. Tell your cousin your sorry his gf condones lying and that it's best she stay away from your family. You dont want your daughter picking up their bad habits.", "NTA. That is a fact", "I think you could have been gentler, saying something like \"Well, if her mom marries your uncle she'll be your step cousin, but maybe she feels like your cousin already, even if she doesn't fit the exact definition\"", "Why are people in 6 months relationship trying to be family? This is like the 3rd post I\u2019m seeing now. People are becoming too entitled!!", "Okay unpopular opinion but Lia wasnt fully wrong, and the gaslighting comment rubbed me up the wrong way. They are not biologically related (as well as the brother and gf haven't been together very long lmao), but you could have explained the difference between biology and created family, which is effectively where this confusion is coming from. \n\nAt the end of the day like you don't *have* to say they are cousins by blood or any other metric but its common courtesy to tread carefully if children are asking if they are family or not. And the options were not \"simply say no they're not cousins\" or \"gaslight my daughter\" for heavens sake. It would have been a moment to open the conversation up to what constitutes family.", "NTA. Unless Jason has proposed and just isn\u2019t telling you guys this isn\u2019t a thing.", "NTA, you actually explained things very nicely. If Carmen can\u2019t get over it, that\u2019s her insecurity.", "NTA- you explained the situation perfectly. Your brother and his girlfriend are the huge assholes here for misleading lia.", "NTA lying and creating false narratives leads to feeding delusions and false expectations. I've seen it on here and in my own family. My cousins are in their fifties and are still dealing with all the delusions they have from being fed false narratives by their dad. Family have tried telling them the truth, but the best they can do is at the truth to the lies to create more complex stories. It is so sad. The reason the child is so upset, is she is being fed false narratives already and its messing with her perception of the world. If you support it it will get worse. Stamp on it now as my parents and her siblings failed to do with their nieces and nephews. Always tell and stand up for the truth.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but Carmen sounds kinda weirdo for acting like this since you guys only met her for the 2nd time. It may be a red flag for your brother and I hope he sees it before it\u2019s too late. Yikes.", "NTA it would do more damage to Tory because she could learn to just say what people want to hear", "NTA - they\u2019re not cousins. It\u2019s inappropriate for the child\u2019s mother to insist otherwise.", "NTA and Carmen sounds exhausting.", "NTA", "NTA. Plus you tried to explain the poor innocent Lia, who has obviously been told white lies, that if Jason and her mum get married, then they would be cousins. You didn\u2019t shut down the possibility of it. Jason and Carmen need to explain it better to Lia. And bravo to you and Tory for sticking to your guns! You shouldn\u2019t have to lie to a child to make them feel a certain way\u2026 what if the truth comes out later on? The feelings would be hurt even more. So yes, again\u2026 NTA!", "Kinda TA. You could have resolved the situation with \u201cwell you are kind of like counsins aren\u2019t you\u201d and then talked with your daughter afterwards and not in front of the other crying child. It costs nothing to be kind to a child who\u2019s thrown into a new family and just trying to fit in. \nWe all know that the definition of family has changed and no longer just means blood relatives.", "Honestly, I had a few temporary \"cousins\" as a kid and it was hard. It would have been easier if the relationship wasn't stressed. OP handled it perfectly. NTA.", "Dear, this is in fact a bigger deal than you realised: Carmen is bonkers and delusional about family dynamics.\n\nOnly about one point she's right: you and your parents might not like her, omitting the fact that she herself caused the problems leading up to this.\nYou did everything right and Carmen made her bed and now has to lie in it...", "Yiiiiiikes.", "That was a shocker!", "Are you actually around 4 year old? They argue this stuff all the time. And they are even more stubborn than adults because they hardly ever back down on their view!", "No it's not. And they can be very petty about it.", "Now I\u2019m interested and would like to know the arguments for and against", "hour long argument on why its ok to add milkshake powder to milk, but not ok to just drink the milk then eat the milkshake powder with a spoon", "That\u2019s madness"]}
