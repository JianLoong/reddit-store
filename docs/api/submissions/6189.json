I can't complain about my time in the US as it was fun while I lived there, I got a wonderful boyfriend and I managed to get an associate degree in social work which might not have happened if I wasn't in Korea. Well last year my grandmother, who had decided to stay in Korea and take care of the farm she had started broke her hip and couldn't take care of it effectively anymore and she had discussed this with my entire family. My family discussed this at first without her and came to the conclusion that it would be best for her sell an move to the US to live with one of them as she is fairly old. My grandmother didn't like the idea and asked if there was any other way. They told her no as, in their words, we all have lives that we can't uproot here. After I found out about this discussion I was furious because it was obvious my grandmother didn't want to leave. So after that I basically ghosted my family and made the spontanious decision to move back to Korea and take care of my grandmother and the farm. My grandmother was surprised and shocked that I had done so but was also happy. After I got settled and everything I called my parents and informed them that there would be no need to have her move to the US as I was there to take care of everything. They were angry at me because they had bought the plane ticket for her to come to the US in February. I told them that I didn't care because she only was going to be leaving reluctantly. My father told me that I threw my life and promising future away and that I was an asshole for it, I'm now curious because I basically did give up everything to move back to my small village to take care of my grandmother and didn't tell anyone that I was doing it even though I knew that my family was planning on moving my grandmother to the US.

Wow you are so generous. Taking care of anyone is hard but moving across the world to do it, that\u2019s amazing. Your family should be proud of you. Obviously none of them wanted to move. You let them know where you went, I think that\u2019s enough. \n\nIt sounds like you are still young, there\u2019s a lot of time for you to make lifelong decisions on whether you want to stay in Korea or move back to the US later. Be proud of yourself in your decisions.", "NTA. Good on you for doing that. I don't know if it's a smart decision, but it sure is a kind one. The US will always be there if you want to go back. But for now, enjoy rebuilding your life. \n\nOnly person I feel bad for is your boyfriend. I know you didn't talk to your family, but I hope you at least said goodbye to him.", "This seems like a situation that is outside of the scope of this subreddit. It sounds like there was a lack of reasonable communication on several fronts, and while I personally think your decision to help out your grandmother is admirable, such important choices that would affect everyone involved should have been discussed explicitly with your family instead of you \"ghosting\" them as you've described here.", "IMO yes and no. You are in a no-win situation, and sadly you cannot win. Were you right not to tell your family? Absolutely because of the shitstorm that you would have had there and potentially not been able to help your grandmother. \n\nForcing your grandmother to live in the US is not a good thing. When I was a child they tried the same thing with my grandmother, and after six months she wanted to go back to Germany.\n\nThe problem that your family has is that they don't want to move to South Korea and hence they are saying to your grand mother take it or leave it. I understand your family completely as their lives is in the US. Whereas your grandmother's live is in South Korea. Meaning there is no compromise and neutral position.\n\nThe only solution is and was that somebody moves to South Korea. You stepped up to the plate and good for you. Did you throw away your life? Again let me tell you something about that.\n\nMy parents immigrated when I was in Grade 1 to North America. I grew up and did all of my education in North America. But then a couple of years after that I went back to Germany and lived in multiple places in Europe. My wife (Canadian) and I are not going back to North America. Meaning you have a new life in South Korea and who knows what doors that will open. You might even move to other places in Asia since you probably have American and South Korean citizenship.\n\nIf you allow me to be cynical, and snarky. Moving out the US right now might not be a bad thing. America is going through its rejuvenation era and going through those era's is why people leave the country in the first. My parents left Germany because of it, and I left Canada because of it. \n\nLong winded... Don't look back, look forward, look forward to spending time with your grandmother, and with time your differences with your family will pass as well. So no IMO you are NTA...", "It sounds like you made a decision on a whim without thinking things through. \n\nYour parents were thinking what was best for the family.\n\nI will go with ESH because ghosting everyone was not the right approach.\n\nTaking care of a sick grandma is a lot of work, and so is a farm.\n\nI hope you don't regret it.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think you aren\u2019t an asshole for wanting to take care of your grandma, but maybe a bit for complete lack of communication with your parents. I don\u2019t know what your priorities are but if it is to stay close with your grandma and take care of her and her farm, you did the right thing. It sounds like a lovely life. But I also feel for your parents who spent lots of effort into immigrating to the states for your future (and the family\u2019s), and their frustration. Not many young people choose to look after their grandparents + the farm over their career. So I think your parents may be worried about you regretting your decision do to so. Korea has a really good care for the elderly, esp those who live alone so I advise you to look into that. I\u2019m sure your grandma appreciates you, you are very kind.", "NTA.  I do question your choice though, moving to Korea to run the farm.  An associate in sociology isn't going to make a big splash in the currrent economy.  But just about anything would be an upgrade from running a one-person farm in Korea.  Not to mention...even assuming the farm is so efficient of an operation that only one person can run it....\n\nHow are you going to run the farm and care for disabled grandma at the same time?\n\nThe way I see it, saving the farm would take a minimum of two people, under the circumstance.  And what's the ROI on such a venture?  Would the yearly profit be enough to sustain livable wages for two people?  After expenses, can you clear 100M KRW profit?  Annual?  The way inflation is going, 200,000,000 annual profit might be a more realistic goal.  Is the farm going to get you there?\n\nYour heart is in the right place, which is why I judge NTA.  But this to me seems like a serious \"leap before you look\" type of tactical error.", "NAH, but why couldn't you just have a normal discussion with your family? It seems unnecessarily spiteful for you to move without telling anyone.", "NTA- i moved to help take care of my grandmother for the last 2 years of her life and it was the best thing I ever did. My family was pissed off too. They had convinced her to go in a home and she hated it and no one was visiting her. And they didn't treat her that well at the home. Your grandmother would not be happy and being there with her will help you be uniquely able to help aging immigrants in the US. Geriatric social services is one if the fastest growing areas of social work in the USA. The US population is aging and people still need help when they are aging. You will be just fine. Id bet you could get a good paying job anywhere in the US because of your experience.  Good job and who knows where following your heart will take you.", "I mean Asshole - no-ish.\n\nBut I\u2019m just going to say your whole post is about other people and what they want and need. Nothing about you.\n\nYou\u2019ve been there forever. Do you want to live in Korea and own a farm in a village? Bc that\u2019s a big life change. Some people would love it, but it\u2019s a choice to make. Not something you do to make your grandma happy.\n\nSounds like you have a lot of pressure and not thinking through your needs. I\u2019d say think about what it is you want in life - other than making your Grandma happy. And probably move back to the US\u2026\n\nAlso, there\u2019s a support group called CoDa for people with codependency - try checking it out. There are steps that help you figure out HOW to figure out your wants and needs, communicate them effectively, and build healthy and mutually beneficial relationships.", "NTA I think this is so generous of you. Your grandmother can be very proud of you. Grandparents are precious people on earth and deserve way better treatments of their family sometimes. Sure it is not ideal that they already paid the ticket and so on. But they didn\u2018t even told you about the discussion and just said no to your grandma so the first mistake was one their side.", "NTA. Human kind needs more people like you mate.", "NTA, if you're happy with your decision to be with your grandmother in korea then that's all that matters.", ">My father told me that I threw my life and promising future away\n\nBeing bilingual in a country that can support the infrastructure for residential Internet connection means that you can still have that promising future.\n\nYou could work from home. You could probably even get a whole bachelor degree online if your parents let you use their US address as a home address.\n\nIt's 2022. Location isn't as important as it once was.\n\nNTA and it sounds like your parents just didn't wanna upset their comfortable lives. Now you can build your own comfortable life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

It is your future and i am sure you thought about what you would be giving up before you moved. It is natural that your family worries for you.
