She said she asked her stepmom to let her help as well to earn some more money but she refused\n\nI talked to my sil and asked her if there is any reason she won't let Nora babysit. She said Katie is older and she thinks Katie is more responsible and better with babies and she doesn't trust Nora with a baby.\n\nI told her it's ok if she doesn't want to let Nora babysit but then she needs to make the payments a bit more fair. Right now Katie gets around twice as much as Nora(Nora gets about 15 and Katie gets about 30 a week). She said babysitting is harder so Katie should be paid more for doing it. I was getting angry so I told her fine, then I'd like to offer Nora a job . She won't do any chores for you anymore. I told Nora she is babysitting for me from now on.\n\nI have a 7 years old son and a 13 years old son.

I offered to pay her 40 a week in exchange for spending time with her cousins. Last week was her first week and all the kids are very happy with this situation\n\nMy sil however is not happy. She called and asked me if I actually paid Nora 40 a week to just watch tv and play video games with her cousins? I told her that I did\n\nShe said I'm being an asshole.

You stick your nose into someone else's household. You start querying them about the division of labor and payment.

Even if your niece is not a good choice for babysitting a 1yo, she and her stepsister should be given equally demanding work to earn equal money. But keep in mind: 1. It's not your place to tell other parents how to parent, and 2. The person you should be really mad at is your brother. It's his primary job to look after the interests of his daughter.\n\nYou had several options when your niece confided to you what was going on. You could have advised her to tell her father, whose job it is to make sure she's treated fairly. That may or may not have done any good, but the father should know what's happening, and know that his daughter feels cheated. (Unless she truly is too immature to babysit young children, which we can't know from your post.) You could also have promised to recommend her to any of your friends who actually need a babysitter, and let her earn money that way. The result to your niece's finances would be the same, and she would know that she truly earned what she has.\n\nBut now, you've made an enemy of your sil, meddled in your brother's marriage, likely created drama in the family beyond your two households, and taught your niece that one-upping her stepmother is a legitimate way to handle conflict.\n\nYTA", "How is any of this your business?

And in that scenario, it\u2019s not so much about contribution, it\u2019s about the pocket money.\n\nYou can have both those scenarios in play together, with multiple kids, as long as the kids are both/all on a reasonably level playing field (age permitting). Once you start paying a difference for the quality/value/difficulty of the work, that\u2019s when you confuse the situation.\n\nNow, sure, they should be doing basic chores to contribute, but if you sold them that on the basis of cash payment, and they get a better offer, they won\u2019t see \u201cwell no pocket money for you then\u201d as a threat.\n\nIf you try to make them do the same chores for *no* money, using punishment as a motivator (ie grounding), that\u2019s actively unfair. Other kid is getting paid to do (at minimum) the same work (I\u2019m presuming that basic non-babysitting chores are shared).\n\nYou could in theory say that they *have* to do chores, threaten grounding, and then pay them additionally if they end up doing those chores because of the grounding threat.\n\nSo\u2026 I think it\u2019s probably a bit tricky to navigate that situation as a parent, especially if you do want to be fair. It\u2019s just that it doesn\u2019t seem like SIL *does* want to be fair.\n\nOther comments from OP do make it sound like Nora doesn\u2019t feel included or valued by her stepmum and stepsister, so ultimately I get why OP said what she did, even if it\u2019s a bit iffy.", "This was my thought too.

People on here scream so much about how unpaid, consistent babysitting of younger siblings is akin to abuse (and I don't disagree in some cases, parentification is a real thing and is harmful) that I'm surprised she's getting so much shit for having the niece be paid to babysit as a point on it's own.

I\u2019m team Nora on the simple fact they have a one age difference and no trusting her to hold a baby is weird, almost like she only trusts her own blood. \n\nnta, but honestly if you don\u2019t at the very least speak to your brother about this fucked up dynamic then everyone sucks here", "NTA you offered your niece a job and she took it.\n\nMy real question is where is your brother in all this?  Why is he letting Nora's stepmother make all the parenting decisions?\n\nIMO both kids should have chores they do at home because that's what you do as part of a family, and then they each are paid for babysitting separately.", "NTA\n\nBut what is the juicy backstory with you and your SIL? Caus you two seem petty with each other, lol.", "YTA\nYou are undermining your brother and SIL.  it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to pay the older sister more money. She does more.

Plus it makes sense for Katie and Nora to be getting different payments if Katie is taking on more with the babysitting on top of other chores.\n\nI feel like we need more info because there are a lot of more reasonable explanations for why there is a difference in allowance.", "Does your SIL make a habit of prioritizing her own blood? It's Katies half brother just as much as Nora's?\nDisappointed in your brother, but so glad you're helping your niece!\n\nLet your SIL know that as Katie is responsible for keeping TWO kids happy and healthy, she shouldn't worry about the payment being too much, because she definitely earned it.  And if Nora needs it to be more equal, she can always do Katies old jobs at home.", "NTA.\n\n  Why SIL,  I don't know what you mean.\n\n$40 is worth the price to pay for a trustworthy teen to watch my beloved children and my children have fun with sitter", "I don\u2019t think you should get to control what chores she does for money at her own house.

Pot meet kettle.. it\u2019s good of you to help your niece and stand up for her but let your niece know to stop talking to step mom about what she does for you because it\u2019s basically non of her business.

One person got paid less and only got the annoying chores. Why should the tasks not be divided in a fair manner.", "Eeeh I\u2019m going to differ with you here. Watching a 1 year old is not like watching a newborn. They\u2019re mobile, demanding, and a frequent danger to themselves. It requires continuous attention, inventiveness, patience (they throw tantrums, want to do the same thing over and over, are learning independence and so actively resist your care) and the task not over until you hand that child off to another person. Unless they\u2019re napping, you can\u2019t usually put them down to attend to something in the same area or leave them alone for short periods of time. Doing the dishes, vacuuming, etc are all discreet tasks that can be finished. It\u2019s hard to determine who\u2019s actually doing more without some first hand observation.", "What does your brother have to say about the way his wife treats his daughter compared to his stepdaughter?", "This was my thoughts reading this post about the ugly evil step mom and Cinderella. \n\nYou get my upvote and OP NTA", "but it\u2019s not fair that nora doesn\u2019t get a choice in which \u201cchore\u201d to do. she is always stuck doing all the household chores while katie CHOOSES to watch the baby and nothing else. that to me is what isn\u2019t fair. katie isn\u2019t doing dishes or laundry or cleaning, she is spending time with her you her sibling. yes one year olds are a handful but she obviously enjoys babysitting more than other chores", "I\u2019ve babysat quite a few kids (never any that were in diapers), that\u2019s literally what it was just about every time. And I got paid way more than $3/hour.", "The problem is that the parents set the rules.  This person busted in to cause drama.  She paid nora more money than katie while her complaint is about katie getting more.  There could be a range of issues.  Maybe nora is not as responsible,15 and 16 are a big difference.  Maybe katie was told she had to wait till she was 16 to help.  Maybe katie got paid less when she was younger.  Maybe nora is not doing as well in school.  Maybe nora has an attitude problem.  Maybe nora has easier jobs and they cant afford to pay another 60 out of pocket a month. Maybe katie has to buy her own clothes and nora does not.  Maybe katie has to chip in for gas and nora does not so katie doesn't have as much extra money.  All these assumptions are made on the sil being a bad person when op is the one who inserted themselves on nora's word alone to make drama.  My perspective of the world was also wildly different when I was 15.  I thought my curfew should be the same as an older teen.\n\nHousehold chores/wage are not based on equality they're more often based on age.  As kids get older and have to pay for more and get more responsibility parents help them transition.\n\nEverything OP did shows it was not about helping nora but snubbing not only the sil but also katie based on their perception of was going on told to them by a 15 year old and in turn they reacted like a 15 year old.  One of ops main gripes is that katie is paid more so she settled that to make things more \"fair\" by paying nora more?  She is pushing on the idea and creating drama because of how she believes things operate in their family instead of talking to her sister in law and brother to come to an adequate solution.\n\nLife isnt fair especially when you're growing up under parents rules.  No one said teaching kids about doing chores has to be about fairness.  My parents gave us an allowance and chores were separate.  We were expected to do chores and I made tons more in allowance because I was buying my own clothes had my brother made the same amount he would have spent it all on coca cola because that's the only thing he had to spend money on so I can understand why my parents didn't want to throw their hard earned money away.  When I got a job my allowance stopped and I was still expected to do chores.  Doing chores for no money is fine.  Again it's a family not a democracy parents dont owe their kids money.  There's a reason that a lot of places need patently permission also for kids to get jobs even at 15.", "Well I spent my teen years babysitting and when I had to babysit a baby it was way harder than the older kids and something my mother wasn't happy about when I was 15.", "I don\u2019t see any mention of Katie choosing this over those other chores though. Even if she is, I don\u2019t see why she would ever do the other chores because her mom pays her more for childcare, incentivizing her to spend her time doing that task. Again though - you\u2019d have to actually see both sisters in action to determine who is actually doing more work. I\u2019m open to the idea that Nora might be but that\u2019s not OBVIOUSLY the case as you\u2019re stating.\n\nI\u2019m of the opinion that everyone is shitty here. Obviously the mom should give Nora some sort of opportunity to make more money so they balance out. The Aunt could maybe help fill that gap to create some equity (and is entitled to pay Nora whatever she wishes) but has instead inserted herself into her brother\u2019s family\u2019s chore schedule and intentionally incentivized Nora not to do any work in her family home anymore. The brother obviously just blows with the wind and isn\u2019t contributing towards the resolution of this problem or the maintenance of family boundaries.

Where the fuck is your brother in all of this nonsense.", "SIL has shown her hand. She favors her kids meaning her blood daughter and son. As long as her daughter has the advantage then everything is ok. Definitely NTA.", "NTA, so her bio daughter got a cushy job and was getting paid a lot, but she was giving her stepdaughter all of the actual hard labor and was paying her less. She's mad that you are paying her stepdaughter a good amount now and she isn't in a position where the only money she can get is through doing all of the cleaning in the house.\n\nIt sounds like your sister-in-law is angry that her stepdaughter is no longer in a position where she has to be a maid to have any spending money. I think this is an issue where you should stop talking to your sister-in-law about this, talk with Nora about how to present this, and bring your brother in. Because given Nora's age, she should be able to tell her dad what's going on, and he should step in. If his wife is using his daughter as a maid and is anger at the idea that she has other options, he needs to stand up for his kid", "op=NTA\n\nAs your SIL is definitely favoring her own child, BUT I hope you had your brother's permission to give Nora this babysitting job.

If she won\u2019t let her babysit, she should have at least offered a way to earn the same as Katie, give her an equally difficult chore to even things out and pay them the same.
