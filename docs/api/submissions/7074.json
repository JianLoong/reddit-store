She said she asked her stepmom to let her help as well to earn some more money but she refused\n\nI talked to my sil and asked her if there is any reason she won't let Nora babysit. She said Katie is older and she thinks Katie is more responsible and better with babies and she doesn't trust Nora with a baby.\n\nI told her it's ok if she doesn't want to let Nora babysit but then she needs to make the payments a bit more fair. Right now Katie gets around twice as much as Nora(Nora gets about 15 and Katie gets about 30 a week). She said babysitting is harder so Katie should be paid more for doing it. I was getting angry so I told her fine, then I'd like to offer Nora a job . She won't do any chores for you anymore. I told Nora she is babysitting for me from now on.\n\nI have a 7 years old son and a 13 years old son. My 13 years old is old enough to watch his brother when my husband and I are at work or on a date night since both kids are very mature and well behaved but they were both happy to spend time with their cousin. I offered to pay her 40 a week in exchange for spending time with her cousins. Last week was her first week and all the kids are very happy with this situation\n\nMy sil however is not happy. She called and asked me if I actually paid Nora 40 a week to just watch tv and play video games with her cousins? I told her that I did\n\nShe said I'm being an asshole.

You stick your nose into someone else's household. You start querying them about the division of labor and payment.

Even if your niece is not a good choice for babysitting a 1yo, she and her stepsister should be given equally demanding work to earn equal money. But keep in mind: 1. It's not your place to tell other parents how to parent, and 2. The person you should be really mad at is your brother. It's his primary job to look after the interests of his daughter.\n\nYou had several options when your niece confided to you what was going on. You could have advised her to tell her father, whose job it is to make sure she's treated fairly. That may or may not have done any good, but the father should know what's happening, and know that his daughter feels cheated. (Unless she truly is too immature to babysit young children, which we can't know from your post.) You could also have promised to recommend her to any of your friends who actually need a babysitter, and let her earn money that way. The result to your niece's finances would be the same, and she would know that she truly earned what she has.\n\nBut now, you've made an enemy of your sil, meddled in your brother's marriage, likely created drama in the family beyond your two households, and taught your niece that one-upping her stepmother is a legitimate way to handle conflict.\n\nYTA", "How is any of this your business?

Lastly, I think that Nora isn't learning a great lesson by being paid to do nothing, your SIL is right about that. What lesson is she learning? Life is fair? Injustice will be over corrected?

Because stepmom and dad could cut OP out of the child's life. And then where would the kid be?\n\nI agree that this is an evil stepmother situation. I would love it if OP's actions solved the whole problem. I just think OP is going to have to handle this differently, and stay well within her own business, if she is going to be able to provide any long-term help for her niece. Because this allowance issue isn't going to be the last time the stepmom treats her stepdaughter unfairly, and the girl is going to need access to her aunt. Which she won't have if OP pisses off stepmom.", "You said, in your post, that your 13 year old watches your 7 year old. That they do NOT need a baby sitter. You then further said that your SIL asked if you're paying her to just watch TV and play video games and you said yes.   \nIf she was actually babysitting, this is a different story. But she's not - by your own words, she's not needed, she's not responsible for the kids, etc.   \nI will change to ESH in that I think mom should give Nora opportunities to earn more if that's what Nora wants. But truly seems as though you're just meddling bc you don't like SIL", "OP didn't overstep. They could have given her an additional chore and made it even. But they didn't. People in this sub sit on a moral high ground. But a lot of us in real life with means do this will react similarly in such a situation, especially if a child they love is being treated unfairly.", "the step mom isn't her parent either", "OP has a six year old. I don't think the niece is just sitting there. Playing with a six year old needs a lot of patience.", "She is not needed but she is wanted. My kids enjoy the company and my 13yo is happy to not be responsible for his brother anymore", "She is the wife though, a stepmom is still kinda a parent. Isn't she legally? I feel like this is something between parents", "So again, you're saying that you're paying your niece to hang out with their cousins bc you don't like how SIL is parenting her.   \nIf she's wanted, have her over. If you want to help teach and parent - at least teach and have her do actual work for the money. You also do NOT get to tell her she's not doing chores at her own home, huge overstep their.  \nIn every way you're just confirming that you're undermining the parenting of Nora and you're not teaching her anything but entitlement.   \nAgain, if she's ACTUALLY babysitting, then it's a different story. But you've not given any indication she's actually working for a wage.   \nI like giving Nora an opportunity to EARN the same (or even more) than her sister. But what you have done is create a bad dynamic of undermining her parents and telling Katie she's not worth being around."]}
