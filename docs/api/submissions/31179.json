We got married a couple of years later and had our second son within the first year of our marriage. Jayce's mom was not in his life. When I met my husband he was a single parent with sole custody. Jayce's mom didn't want to take him home from the hospital and Jayce automatically went into my husband's custody. So when Jayce started to talk he would call me mama and mommy. I have always loved Jayce with all my heart.\n\nI was pregnant with our oldest daughter when Jayce's mom said she wanted to be in his life. Jayce was 7 and his mom went through the courts to get visitation. A step up plan was put into place. She started off with supervised visits, followed by one overnight every other week and then it went to every other weekend. She never went beyond that because the judge did not think that much upheaval would be good.\n\nIt was rough for Jayce at first but over time he grew so much closer to his mom. Once they started getting closer she started engaging in parental alienation and Jayce started pulling away from us. It started when he was 11 and my husband and I were back and forth in court over this. Jayce's mom had to go to therapy and she needed to do co-parenting classes with my husband (I was not allowed to attend). Then two years ago Jayce said he wanted to live with his mom. She took us to court. Jayce was spoken to and it was denied initially but then we had problems with him just going to his mom's and refusing to come home, so she won the second time. The judge said he needed to maintain contact with us. Ordered every other weekend visitation as a minimum.\n\nJayce is now 16 and our other kids are 13, 10 and 9. Our other kids miss him like crazy but hate when he's around because he has changed so much and gets so angry with them for wanting a relationship with him. They have started to pull back. My husband's parents have told them they shouldn't do that or Jayce won't know they love him still. My husband has told them to stop that because it puts too much on the kids.\n\nA few days ago ILs stopped by because our 13 year old was told he was getting an award for something and ILs wanted to congratulate him. They brought up invite Jayce to the ceremony when it happens and my son said he didn't want to. My ILs started to address all the kids saying they should never stop wanting their brother and to think of how it would make Jayce feel. They said you don't  just discard family. I asked my ILs to stop and told them not to be so hard on the kids because this was a difficult situation for them too. My ILs told me they weren't being hard on the kids, they were teaching them an important lesson. I told them they were being too hard on them. They left in anger and texted my husband who was out of town for work. He told them I wasn't wrong. But they said I was rude for accusing them of being too hard on the kids.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700245061, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xlbnk/aita_for_telling_my_ils_to_stop_being_so_hard_on/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason for feeling like an asshole is I insisted that I felt they were, even when they argued back and this all went down in front of my kids. At the time I wanted them to see me stand up for them. But my ILs felt it was rude and I feel like that could be part of it.

They're unloading too much guilt onto your kids. Jayce is at a complicated age and full of complicated feelings.

They're responsible for their relationship with Jayce, period", "NTA. You need to  have a talk with IL about making 13 year olds accomplishment about Jayce and let the poor kid have his moment.  It's the kids' decision to distance themselves and it has nothing to do with them. And it doesn't sound like he'd come anyway.", "NTA They basically poked holes in their own logic, Jayce made his choice to leave, and therefore, he's in a way abandoning them, so why is it on the younger siblings to foster this relationship? If everyone was older and had more life experience, I'd say it'd be a more appropriate conversation, but these kids are literally in the middle of hormonal changes and putting this pressure on them to be the bigger person is only gonna harm all of them even Jayce.", "NTA. It's important to prioritize the emotional well-being of your children, especially in a difficult situation like this. Your ILs may have good intentions, but constantly pressuring the kids to maintain a relationship can put unnecessary strain on them. It's crucial to let the kids navigate their own feelings and decisions in their own time.", "NTA. You don't owe anyone anything.

Regardless of their opinions about this, you have every right as their parent to set this boundary with them and if they want to have a relationship with your children they should respect it. It's obviously a complicated situation, but putting the responsibility on children to maintain a relationship with their older brother is pretty wild and it sounds like you and your husband are doing the right thing here.", "INFO:  Do the ILs have a relationship/contact with Jayce\u2019s mother?

It comes down to this: you are the parent, and, thus, the final authority on your children\u2019s lives. Grandparents\u2019 authority come far is second place after yours. So, when you tell them to stop, they shouldn\u2019t argue with you, they should stop. If they think you are wrong, they can discuss it with you at some other time. \n\nAnd them saying you were rude is like saying \u201cit wasn\u2019t what you said, it was how you said it\u201d - that is when someone can\u2019t admit they were wrong and doesn\u2019t want to be seen to back down.", "NTA.  Your kids' efforts at having a relationship with Jayce won't matter unless Jayce wants a relationship too, so it isn't fair of your in-laws to act as if your kids need to be the peacemakers here.", "Your ILs need to butt out.  This is a nuanced issue between parents and children and they aren\u2019t either of those categories so they need to stay in their own lane.  Your husband needs to draw a distinct boundary with them about this.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nThe in-laws overstepped.  They need to stay in their own lane.", "NTA. They're setting your kids up for a heartbreaking disappointment if things don't go the way they hope. There is zero reason to put your kids through that. They're already coping as best they can given the situation.", "NTA it\u2019s literally none of their business, not their kids, not their rules. It\u2019s really simple. Grandparents are owed fuck all.", "That's exactly how we feel. We understand the fear of irreparable damage to their relationship. But that will happen if too much force is put on the younger kids to always reach out only to be rejected or for Jayce to show but have an attitude about the whole thing and make a scene. This has been such a difficult situation for everyone but the kids are kids, just like Jayce, and they need compassion here too.", "My husband told them that yesterday. We're not really sure they will listen but we hope they do.", "Lovely response! The grandparents are TA. They totally hijacked the 13 yr olds achievement", "That's something they cannot see unfortunately. It only harms the relationship between the four kids even more.", "Exactly. It's so important to be understanding and compassionate with them like we have always been with Jayce. The situation as a whole is so rough to navigate and the kids are still so young.", "That's something we have struggled with a lot. We really had to leave it to the courts and the professionals they appointed and they almost always try to allow contact between a child and their bio parent(s). But it created so many problems. Especially when they were okay with some of her \"hiccups\" early on, like missing some days with him and then other days trying to extend their time together.", "It's very complicated and very emotional for all of us. And you are right that it's wild to put the entire relationship on the younger kids. It's not something as easy as just stay open. Over time the hurts collect and could do more harm over time.", "I'm so sorry, I don't understand why she did all this when she disappeared for several years. I get she may have had PP but come on. This was unnecessary. I'm so sorry you're going through this. Hopefully, Jayce changes. If not, just focus on your younger ones. NTA", "My message would have been something like: \"My house, my rules. If you don't like them don't visit.\" \n\nI know this is harsh and I don't know your relationship situation but I have never tolerated someone else trying to overrule my parenting decisions.", "Your in laws need to mind their own business.\n\nYour children are entitled to have whatever relationship want and feelings they have.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This isn\u2019t really about them being \u201ctoo hard on the kids.\u201d It\u2019s about them bullying the kids because they don\u2019t like the situation.", "NTA. You and your husband are the parents. It\u2019s *your* job to teach your children things, not your ILs\u2019.", "NTA but this is a sucky situation.\n\nYou have a mom who abandoned her kid at hospital. Pretty sure that would normally be considered termination of parental rights.  Your husband had son for 7 years and mom just waltz back in. What was the judge thinking.  She gave up her rights and never should of gotten them back.  The fact that she manipulated Jayce into going against dad is proof that her rights should never of been reinstated.  \n\nSince Jayce left your home he changed.  He is being mean to his siblings and that isn\u2019t their fault.\n\n\nDo the grandparents expect your kids to keep being nice to a a stranger who punches them?  I know that this is their brother but the same logic applies.", "NTA. Gram and Gramps suggest, they ask, they accept the no, they move on. Ideally.", "NTA.  I somewhat understand where they\u2019re coming from, but ultimately I feel like it\u2019s a toxic mentality to keep turning the other cheek and accepting abusive behavior from a family member to \u2018show them you still love them\u2019 and because family, etc.  Your kids definitely shouldn\u2019t be shouldering the weight of maintaining this relationship, and their feelings are valid too.  Sorry, but alienation is the possible consequence for Jayce\u2019s actions here.  It\u2019s honestly sad, but also the reality.", "Exactly.  I was thinking this too. \n\nThis is too much pressure to put on the kids. Honestly, if grandparents are so concerned,  maybe they should start forging a stronger bond with Jace and leave the kids out of it.\n\nNTA"]}
