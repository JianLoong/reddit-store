But there has been multiple times where I\u2019ve been on the toilet and the handle has just stared to literally jiggle frantically. I quickly go to open it and it would always be my roomie\u2019s bf who would say \u201cI really have to go\u201d or \u201c(roomie) has a question.\u201d this also happened two times when I was showering which pisses me off because you can hear the shower from outside the door so obviously leave me alone. he never asks to touch our things and never knocks. when I hear him stomping up to my door I\u2019ll alwyas cover myself because I know he won\u2019t knock. I cant even wear a towel to go to the laundry room because I know he (and sometimes even his unannounced friends)will be there sitting on the couch giving me a weird look.\n\nI haven\u2019t complained to anyone but my other roomie (who feels the same way about him) bc we still have another semester to live together after signing the lease.

I was getting dressed for a sneaky link that same night and couldn\u2019t find my tights in my sock drawer.

I asked who else it would\u2019ve been and she had the audacity to look straight at me and go \u201cmaintenance maybe?\u201d I was so livid. I told her to check her stuff.

There was this girl who was in the other room who would allow her boyfriend to come over. My suite mate and I used to come back to the room between classes to take naps or take a break. How about I woke up to someone trying to open my bedroom door. But I always locked the door when I was in the room. You had to use a key to open it from the other side. Told the roommate about it and then also reported it to the resident advisors.

Creeper knows he's been caught but it'll only be a matter of time before he can't stop and it escalates.", "NTA\n\nGo to the RA before this gets even more out of control and get yourself some new friends because the ones you have... aren't actually your friends and people who talk behind your back like this.. will never really be your friends. Take this from a mid 30 year old who dealt with that crap... I prefer my small but close-have you back always - group of 4 girls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nget a camera for your room but position it so you don't break any rules.. like aka not on your bed but on your closet/dresser and door.", "NTA- and it's time for new friends. If people honestly feel you just stirring the pot when it happened to both of you then you are better off without them. Those are not your friend. Report him anyway. You shouldn't feel like a prisoner in your own home. While it may seem like a long time to be ignored by your roommate  it's better than spending allllll semester uncomfortable in your own home. She can go hang out at his place.", "THE DUDE IS STEALING YOUR UNDERWEAR OP! Say that out loud to yourself a couple of times. It's not even just you, he feels so comfortable he's done it to both of his GFs roommates. You have no idea what else he's done while in your room. Report his creepy ass now. Any of your friends have comments just tell them that, he stole your underwear. NTA", "Agree. And not only is your room mate slandering you but she is enabling her boyfriend. It seems clear to me that you are concerned that he is being creepy with women - and not just you - and I\u2019m sure your RA will agree.", ">he never asks to touch our things and never knocks. when I hear him stomping up to my door I\u2019ll alwyas cover myself because I know he won\u2019t knock\n\nYour roommate's boyfriend is a creepy guy.\n\nI would be willing to bet money that he's either (a) assaulted women in the past, or (b) working up to assaulting someone.\n\nTalk to your RA **right now**. Do not wait another minute.", "Tell your roommate to hook up at her boyfriends room", "Double check that you don\u2019t already have a camera in your room. It sounds like he is trying to get a peek at you with the way he barges in on you.", "Agree with talking to RA, immediately.\n\nNot so much on camera/lock. First, you really need to look into these items as they may violate a school policy and get OP into trouble.", "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair", ">NTA, you deserve to feel comfortable in your own home and he has constantly ignored the very simple boundaries you put down.\n\nThis.", "I live in Canada, where there's a pretty infamous case of a guy who started out stealing undies when he was younger, then escalated to home invasion and rape, then eventually became a serial killer. As a society, we really need to stop minimizing this kinda stuff. Most creeps start out small.\n\nETA: just Googled to remind myself. Col. Russell Williams was stealing panties in his 20s and murdering women by his 40s. Don't ignore this OP.", "Not if they are in her private space.  So she would only need a camera in her room to catch if someone is coming in and what is happening in her room when she is not there.  They don't have to be mounted to the walls or ceiling.  There are ones that you can just sit on the night stand.\n\nI would have one pointed towards the door and underwear drawer.  Ideal if you can capture the majority of the room but best to catch the areas where he is most likely to rifle through ie drawers and wardrobe.", "That guy is one sick and twisted individual.", "I know someone who worked with his wife - a couple years before he was caught.", "it's not really her private place if it's owned by a university.. rules are different when these things are brought into the mix. Kind of like how if a crime happens a lot of universities don't contact the police and have free reign over punishments... that's how we get sexual assaulters whose only punishments are to write sorry notes.."]}
