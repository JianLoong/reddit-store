I\u2019m a 20 year old living with two other girls, one has a boyfriend who stays here most nights.\n\nwe all share one bathroom and that was never an issue. But there has been multiple times where I\u2019ve been on the toilet and the handle has just stared to literally jiggle frantically. I quickly go to open it and it would always be my roomie\u2019s bf who would say \u201cI really have to go\u201d or \u201c(roomie) has a question.\u201d this also happened two times when I was showering which pisses me off because you can hear the shower from outside the door so obviously leave me alone. he never asks to touch our things and never knocks. when I hear him stomping up to my door I\u2019ll alwyas cover myself because I know he won\u2019t knock. I cant even wear a towel to go to the laundry room because I know he (and sometimes even his unannounced friends)will be there sitting on the couch giving me a weird look.\n\nI haven\u2019t complained to anyone but my other roomie (who feels the same way about him) bc we still have another semester to live together after signing the lease. I was going to bite my tongue until recently. my roomie borrowed my fake ID to go out and I found it returned on my bed one day. not only that but when I opened my drawers, I noticed that my previously folded clothes were messed up, as if someone had tried to refold them. I was getting dressed for a sneaky link that same night and couldn\u2019t find my tights in my sock drawer. I am 80% sure that roommate\u2019s bf took them because I already talked to roommate and she said that her drawers looked like that too and she had a bra missing. \n\nwhen she told me this I immediately knocked on roomie\u2019s door to talk to her about this issue. I asked for just her to step out to the hall so we can talk and other roomie came up and we told her about this. She completely denied it saying that neither of them did that. I asked who else it would\u2019ve been and she had the audacity to look straight at me and go \u201cmaintenance maybe?\u201d I was so livid. I told her to check her stuff. I called her bf out into the hall and told him for the fourth time to start knocking on doors before entering. I told them if we keep having an issue then I\u2019m gonna talk to the RA about how he\u2019s staying here without paying anything. she gave me an extremely bitchy look before shutting her door without saying anything. \n\never since that she won\u2019t even look at me, and her boyfriend tries very hard to avoid me and ignores me. we\u2019re all part of a large friend group and one of my closer friends told me that she was complaining about me to her and other girls saying that I was looking for attention pretending like her boyfriend wants me because nobody else does. I feel like I\u2019m insane, I keep doubting myself even though I\u2019m not alone in this experience.

Honey, go to the RA. There\u2019s no friendship left here to protect if she\u2019s slandering you to your other friends in defense of some weirdo. \n\nEven if he didn\u2019t go through your drawers/remove your items, you don\u2019t feel comfortable with this person in your home. That\u2019s enough.", "NTA. Report his presence to the RA. Put a camera in your room if you can\u2019t put a lock on the door. Does the bathroom door lock? If so, let him bang on the door all he wants, just ignore it. Tell him if the bathroom is occupied he needs to go find a public toilet to use. You have a right to feel safe and comfortable in your space, ignore the rumors.", "NTA at ALL. I've been in your shoes before- I used to have a roommate who would help herself to my food, and her boyfriend would barge into our bathroom while I was in there, not flush our toilet, and stomp around making noise at 5am. Absolutely report them to your RA.", "NTA - The boyfriend trying to enter rooms without knocking is creepy and downright rude. Feeling like you can't even relax in your own bedroom or the shower as he might enter unannounced is not okay.", "Your roommate's boyfriend is stealing your and your other roommate's underwear. I would not be waiting to call the RA. He needs to be out. It is no coincidence that he doesn't knock. He should not be living there.  And his presence is not conducive to your wellbeing. \n\nNTA.", ">  we\u2019re all part of a large friend group \n\nCreeps thrive in the darkness because they pick victims who are afraid to turn on the lights. It's time to tell the entire friend group about his behavior. Sending this thread in a group chat he's not on is a good start. So is going to the RA right now.  \n\nPredators often start with small shit like this and get worse because no one ever goes public. Time to go public and kick his ass out.  \n\nNTA", "NTA at ALL that's a serious invasion of privacy and not ok in anyway. go to your RA and talk with them.", "NTA. Go to the RA. Why should a fourth person be staying there without your leave and without paying? When he then starts creeping on you and going through your stuff that is boundary stomping to the nth degree. BTW, being ignored by people like that is a blessing, isn't it?", "Talk to the RA and see what they say. NTA", "NTA, you deserve to feel comfortable in your own home and he has constantly ignored the very simple boundaries you put down. He has been super inappropriate and if your friend can't listen to your and other roomies concerns then I'd be dubious of that friendship as well. Good for you for setting boundaries and sticking to them. If he won't respect them then he should be kicked out and threatening that isn't an a-hole move, it's just you setting boundaries. If she wants to talk smack about you to other friends that's on her, you've done nothing wrong", "NTA. Go to the RA. Why wait? Do you want to live like this for any longer than you have to?", "NTA and stop making yourself live in constant anxiety so your roommate can get laid by her creepy, disrespectful bf. \n\n\nThis is your home. This is why they have RA's. See if you can get your other roommate to go with you. Don't wait until it escalates further and he ends up assaulting someone.", "NTA. Interesting and telling that she turns your reasonable requests and accusations of creepiness and theft into something akin to you are seeking her boyfriends attention.\n\nTo me that says SHE KNOWS he\u2019s doing this, and it\u2019s because he\u2019s a creep, trying to catch you undressed etc in the bathroom, your room and taking underwear.\n\nShe\u2019s literally victim blaming and gaslighting and lying about you.\n\nThis is NOT a friend.   \n\nReport them both.", "NTA. Put a lock on your door and/or a camera in your room. Report to the RA if you need to, just prepare for the storm to follow. \n\nIf your friend group can\u2019t appreciate how your privacy has been violated, are they really your friends? Tell them that they can room with them next semester, then.", "NTA!!! I had a similar situation in college. My roommates boyfriend lived with us too and he was awful. So was she to be fair but they would always steal my things or go through my stuff. Nip it in the bud now before it escalates. I ended up having to get a restraining order against both of them (super long story lol). Go to your RA if you live on campus or if you have a lease with a landlord go to them. Explain the situation and see what they can do. If his name is not in the lease he\u2019s not allowed to be living there end of story.", "NTA she\u2019s already being cold to you, how much worse could she get while not being kicked out by the school too.", "NTA. OP, you should go speak to your RA immediately. He is making you feel unsafe in your home, that is never ok.\n\nNot to be scary, but have you and your other roommate checked your personal areas for cameras?  My little sister's male roommate in college hid video cameras in her room and the bathroom and was watching her for months.\n\nAlso, the appropriate response for somebody opening your door without knocking is to yell loudly and angrily. \"What the fuck!? Don't you knock? Get the hell out!\"", "NTA. Just remember, it isn't just you this guy is creeping on. Your other roommate is having problems too. I would talk to RA anyways. If he isn't contributing to your household, his lazy ass shouldn't be there. He especially shouldn't be there if he is fondling you & your roommate's stuff. I would put a locking doorknob on my bedroom door. He could be in the early stages of even creepier behavior.", "You're not insane.  Your roommate's bf has definitely worn out his welcome with everyone except his gf.  He doesn't knock before entering your room, or the washroom?  2 big strikes against him, and just for that alone, you would be right to go talk to the RA.  And then he starts going through your stuff?  Nah, three strikes and he's out.  Go talk to the RA.  Your roommate is an AH, her boyfriend is an even bigger AH. NTA\n\nI wonder how those friends would feel if they'd been in your position... him walking in on them in the washroom, and barging into their rooms.  Manhandling their stuff. I very much doubt they'd be ok with it.  \n\nYou might want to make sure that they know YOUR side of the story... I'll bet they've been given a very skewed version of events from your roomie.", "NTA", "You\u2019re not crazy. He\u2019s using your and your roommate\u2019s underwear for his \u201cpersonal alone time\u201d. He walks in on you for \u201cinspiration\u201d. Go to the RA and tell EVERYONE what has transpired.", "It\u2019s amazing how many of these you don\u2019t even need to know what happened, just the setup/situation.\n\nNTA, he shouldn\u2019t be there at all in the first place and they both need to get out at this point. Should have told the RA as soon as he spent two consecutive nights or more than once a week. It\u2019s a dorm not a men\u2019s shelter.", "You need to not give them an ultimatum and tell the RA TODAY. Say you\u2019re extremely uncomfortable, there is no permission for him to stay, he tries going into your private spaces when you\u2019re in them and when you\u2019re not and say he\u2019s very creepy. Tell him you want him out now and that your belongings have been stolen too. NTA", "Nta are you sure you are not in grade school.  You all sou d so childish.  Report him.  He doesn't pay rent, he us causing g problems between roommates and he may be a creep.thzt is taking your underwear for sexual purposes. A child would sit there and do nothing about him.  An adult would put a stop to this now.  Which are you a frightened child or a mature adult?", "INFO Can\u2018t you put door locks on your room and the bathroom?", "NTA.
