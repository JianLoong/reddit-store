NTA", "Nope, tried to explain the situation and say i even have video proof that what they claim didnt happen but they are to stupid to care that theres evidence. They want none of it. Another reason im close to just evicting them all now.", "Your advice is to make kids who have nothing to do with this homeless when he can just show his aunt the video proving his dog didn't attack his cousin so she knows the threat is pointless?", "I would say get lawyers involved.", "So basically they say \"I don't care that you can proof, that your cousin is at fault, we want that money!\" ?\n\nWell, NTA\n\nBut as others mentioned, it might be better to call the police for the attepted extortion (if you have proof for that)", "Police likely wont deal with this since as they would say \"its a civil matter\". Reports for dogs go through local councils for the area the dog would be registered with. Doubt the council will do anyting to my dog but unfortunatly its just probably a matter the police wont deal with since its between family that are also tenants.", "Crappy legal system, if extortion is ok if it's family.\n\nIs it possible to start the eviction procedure and stop it before they are actually out on the streets?\n\nMight make them more compliant.", "NTA\nCan you take the video to the police and report an attempted burglary? Get out ahead of it?", "NTA\n\nBut why didn't you just tell them if they try to report your dog, you will file a police report for attempted burglary and will give the video proof to the police and tell them its your cousin and where to find him and you will definitly press charges. \n\nThis way only your cousin would be affected from the \"punishment\", not the small kids living in the house.", "Nta ! Start to charge them for rent ! As long as they treat you right i get why you would help them bettering the life of their child. But no they are trynna take advantage of you and your kind heart.
