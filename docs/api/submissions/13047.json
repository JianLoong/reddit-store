We\u2019re really close. \n\nMia\u2019s being bullied by a couple kids. We\u2019ve tried everything but the school is not cooperating. My parents have suggested moving but Mia refuses so we\u2019re trying to support her. \n\nAnyways, my mom got a call from the school a couple days ago and what happened was that Mia recorded a boy and posted it on social media. They showed my mom the video and the boy was crying really bad (like a panic attack) while a teacher comforted him. They knew it was Mia because she didn\u2019t try to hide it.\n\nMia seemed unbothered by the whole thing and I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. If this boy bullied her, I\u2019d understand. But this boy didn\u2019t. \n\nHe\u2019s dating one of the girls and is in the friend group but Mia admitted that he\u2019s never around when the bullying happens. She doesn\u2019t really have anything against him like she does with the others. \n\nBut her attitude kept getting worse. \n\nWhile I do want her to stand up for herself and for the bullies to get a taste of their own medicine, I don\u2019t want her to take it out on someone who isn\u2019t involved and has problems of their own. Besides, this boy is well liked and she just dug a bigger hole for herself.\n\nI picked her up from school yesterday and she looked more upbeat than usual so I asked her what was up. Apparently there are rumours that the boy\u2019s not coming back to school till next year because he\u2019s getting sent to a mental health facility. \n\nI asked my sister why this was good news. She said \u201cwell he\u2019s like the center of the whole friend group and he\u2019s -blank\u2019s- boyfriend. If he isn\u2019t there, then the whole group falls apart and I get the upper hand.\u201d I asked her if this is what she really wanted? I mean she said herself that the boy\u2019s actually pretty chill. She said yes, he never said anything to me but guys like him need to be put down a bit. She then asked if I was proud of her.\n\nI told her that I\u2019m not. I\u2019m actually disappointed. She got all quiet and said that she\u2018s just frustrated. She knew that no one would actually be mean to him so that\u2019s why she decided to record and post his breakdown online. I told her that she still messed up. She got mad at me and said that she thought I\u2019d be on her side at least. I told her that I am on her side, but I\u2019m not proud of her actions. She called me a bitch and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. AITA? I know the situation isn\u2019t fair, but what she did was wrong. Even she says that the boy was just an easy target.", "created_utc": 1679606081, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zxnl6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_im_not_proud_of_her/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It also isn't very good that she's happy he went into a mental health facility after the fact.", "NTA. She needs professional help.", "Hey, it sounds like you're really caught up in a tough situation with your sister. It's clear that you care about her and want to support her, but you also recognize that what she did wasn't okay.\n\nIt's understandable that your sister is frustrated with the bullying she's experiencing, but recording someone's breakdown and posting it online is not the way to handle it. It's important to stand up for yourself, but not at the expense of someone else's well-being.\n\nWhen you told your sister that you're not proud of her actions, you were being honest with her while still showing that you care. It's important to hold her accountable for her choices, but also to continue to support her through this difficult time.\n\nIt's concerning that your sister seems to be taking pleasure in the idea of this boy being sent to a mental health facility and sees it as an opportunity to gain the upper hand. This kind of attitude is not healthy or productive and could lead to even more problems down the line.\n\nMoving forward, it may be helpful to have a calm and respectful conversation with your sister about the impact of her actions and how she can make amends. It's important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding, but also to stand firm in your belief that what she did was wrong.", "NTA.

I'd have told her the same.\n\nThis boy had nothing to do with the bullying, and she shouldn't have taken this out on him.

Sadly, this sounds like a lose-lise situation until she sees the error of her ways and actually apologizes to the boy.", "NTA but I seriously wonder if your sister was bullied, or if she had done other awful stuff to kids that resulted in her being called out. This is pathological behavior. Bully and humiliate a kid to destroy a friend group. She needs therapy.", "NTA, but he *is* connected to the bullying. He's apart of the friend group and most likely knows about what they're doing even when not present, and is still a bystander. \n\nThis is his punishment along with one of the girls, but that doesn't mean your sister shouldn't be punished either. He dug his hole with the people he surrounded himself with, she dug hers.\n\nShe is still the victim, but people expecting victims not to fight back are in denial. \n\nYour parents shouldn't have asked her to move once it was this bad. Since she obviously has no one, they should have taken her out. What was her reason for not being taken out anyway?\n\nTherapy and guidance counselors might not work because she'll still be in the situation and she was level-headed when it happened. The most they'll do will ask her how she would feel if she was him or to empathize with the bullies.
