We\u2019re really close. \n\nMia\u2019s being bullied by a couple kids. We\u2019ve tried everything but the school is not cooperating. My parents have suggested moving but Mia refuses so we\u2019re trying to support her. \n\nAnyways, my mom got a call from the school a couple days ago and what happened was that Mia recorded a boy and posted it on social media. They showed my mom the video and the boy was crying really bad (like a panic attack) while a teacher comforted him. They knew it was Mia because she didn\u2019t try to hide it.\n\nMia seemed unbothered by the whole thing and I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. If this boy bullied her, I\u2019d understand. But this boy didn\u2019t. \n\nHe\u2019s dating one of the girls and is in the friend group but Mia admitted that he\u2019s never around when the bullying happens. She doesn\u2019t really have anything against him like she does with the others. \n\nBut her attitude kept getting worse. \n\nWhile I do want her to stand up for herself and for the bullies to get a taste of their own medicine, I don\u2019t want her to take it out on someone who isn\u2019t involved and has problems of their own. Besides, this boy is well liked and she just dug a bigger hole for herself.\n\nI picked her up from school yesterday and she looked more upbeat than usual so I asked her what was up. Apparently there are rumours that the boy\u2019s not coming back to school till next year because he\u2019s getting sent to a mental health facility. \n\nI asked my sister why this was good news. She said \u201cwell he\u2019s like the center of the whole friend group and he\u2019s -blank\u2019s- boyfriend. If he isn\u2019t there, then the whole group falls apart and I get the upper hand.\u201d I asked her if this is what she really wanted? I mean she said herself that the boy\u2019s actually pretty chill. She said yes, he never said anything to me but guys like him need to be put down a bit. She then asked if I was proud of her.\n\nI told her that I\u2019m not. I\u2019m actually disappointed. She got all quiet and said that she\u2018s just frustrated. She knew that no one would actually be mean to him so that\u2019s why she decided to record and post his breakdown online. I told her that she still messed up. She got mad at me and said that she thought I\u2019d be on her side at least. I told her that I am on her side, but I\u2019m not proud of her actions. She called me a bitch and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. AITA? I know the situation isn\u2019t fair, but what she did was wrong.

Granted, she does say that he\u2019s probably just too preoccupied with his own problems to give a shit so I doubt he\u2019s stopped his girlfriend or friends but if his problems were enough to send him to a mental health facility then it wouldn\u2019t be fair to make him the sole victim of her punishment. What about the others? The actual bullies? What does humiliating that boy do for her? \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is messed up to say, but if my sister did anything to... let\u2019s say his girlfriend who actually does bully her, then I would not be bothered. I\u2019d even be proud. But I will never support my sister hurting (because she did hurt him) an innocent boy who\u2019s already dealing with a lot (her own words)."]}
