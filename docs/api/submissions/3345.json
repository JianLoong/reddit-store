For the most part things are really good and I plan to propose soon and hopefully have at least a couple of kids with her.\n\nHowever we've run up against a conflict.\n\nShe's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast. She likes a huge breakfast in the morning. She usually has eggs, either French toast or pancakes, hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes, and sausage or bacon. Sometimes on weekends it's ham or steak. She eats almost nothing for lunch and usually has a smallish dinner but she loves a huge breakfast.\n\nMeanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning.\n\nHowever my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her \"no\" but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her.\n\nShe seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return. But I think that since she makes a huge breakfast for herself every morning anyway that throwing an extra portion of whatever she's making on for me would take next-to no effort on her part, so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?", "created_utc": 1669547862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5ys4j/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_start_making_me/", "score": 556, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s already up so she should be the one to pack bags and lunches and cook Everyone breakfast?  She\u2019s breastfeeding so you never need to cover the night wake ups?  She\u2019s home earlier \u201coften\u201d and that\u2019s the person who starts dinner 1 and picks up the kids and deals with the homework but you\u2019re totally doing 50/50. She\u2019s washing her clothes anyway so it\u2019s no extra effort to put yours in - then fold them and put them away cause she\u2019s doing that for the rest of the load right? \n\nIt sounds like she already feels like she\u2019s doing more and now you\u2019re asking for something else.  If it would require effort and energy for you to do it, it requires effort and energy for her to do it. This may be a small amount of additional energy for this one thing but it makes me wonder if she\u2019s already feeling that she\u2019s putting out significantly more effort for household duties as it stands.", "You are not an asshole for asking. You are absolutely an asshole for insisting after she made a very reasonable suggestion. You already share dinner cooking responsibilities, so it is perfectly reasonable to request the same for breakfast. You just want to take advantage of the fact she is up. And no it isn't just slapping down some extra food. All the planning and prep work also changes. So no, it isn't just slap on a couple of extra things and call it good. If you don't want to share in that work too, then I don't blame her at all for turning you down.\n\nYTA", "I\u2019m trying to understand because I didn\u2019t get it.\nYou want her to maker breakfast for two in the morning because you don\u2019t have the strength to but it\u2019s not supposed to count as a chore like the rest?", "YTA LMFAO  \n\n\n\"Oh so we'll take turns making breakfast for each other? :D\"  \"Oh.. no you'll just make food for me, it's no extra effort for you anyways\"  \n\n\nThe CHEEK on you.", "Ah, I remember the early days of counting up all you do and all they do.

Not true, nor is the cost.\n\nThere's bound to be a way to sort it but it's about your attitudes.\n\nGood luck.", ">so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?\n\n\n\nBecause you are asking her to do something for you.

I\u2019m just like your girlfriend. Breakfast is my main meal. I nibble at work as I have to taste with sample spoons what I cook. I wake up early for personal time and cooking. My husband skips breakfast. \n\nIf he TOLD me to cook him breakfast (you didn\u2019t ask because no wasn\u2019t an option) it would be extra work. Planning it out, shredding twice as many potatoes, doing twice as much work for French toast, keeping it warm.. it\u2019s not me time now. \n\nIt\u2019s more work. And is expected. And doesn\u2019t leave me the option of doing something weird when I feel like it. Like eating leftover pizza or a tuna sandwich. \n\nSo yep there would be compromise if I did this extra work. \n\nHusband would do it every other day or make all dinners (why not? Just double what you are making for yourself!) \n\nWhat would you do if you had no girlfriend and wanted a hot breakfast?\n\nDo that or compromise. It actually is double the work, prep, and shopping and removes the days when you don\u2019t feel like it and eat a slice of pie \n\nIt\u2019s forced and less fun and more work. That\u2019s fine if you pick up somewhere else. You are eating dinner anyway. You are awake at dinner and are a night person.

It's about not letting a precedent be set of an unfair division of labor in an equal relationship.", "YTA. If you offered to make every dinner while she makes everybreakfast, that would be a reasonable compromise.", "YTA, not for asking, but for how you reacted when she said no. You tried to persuade her into doing it by saying how easy you think it is, and ignored her reasonable compromise.", "Simple compromise is you always make dinner for her, and she always makes breakfast for you. Seems fair to me", "YTA.\n\nOnly if you make her dinner every night. I mean, you're already cooking for yourself, what's an extra portion thrown in? Right?", "YTA but not for asking her to make breakfast like you worded it. If was perfectly fine for you to ask her if she would be willing to do it for you, but she can certainly say no. She doesn't owe it to you just cause she's awake or cause she's already cooking.\n\nYou became the AH when that answer wasn't okay with you, you weren't willing to do anything in return for her extra work and you weren't willing to accept her answer. That's just selfish.\n\nWe all make choices for ourselves, you might not be a morning person, but you can put on your big boy pants and figure out a way to get up and make yourself breakfast if it's important to you. Go to bed earlier, stop drinking so much caffeine, prep your breakfast the night before. The possibilities are endless, be an adult and figure it out.", "YTA\n\nNot everything can easily be doubled up and she\u2019s got a point about what will be more effort every morning.", "How about you do the dishes after every breakfast?", "YTA for refusing to take another task on to equal it out.

That\u2019s fair play.", "Info: why can't you just always make dinner instead?", "YTA. \n\nYou could pitch in by offering to do something else, that would equal the amount of effort she'd put into making breakfast for the both of you.", "You'll soon become a morning person if you have kids cause they wake up early. Or will you delegate their care to your GF as you're not a morning person? Just set your alarm & cook breakfast, it's not that hard.", "Huh?? You're definitely the asshole here, and you not understanding that is ridiculous. She's right, if you trade off making dinner, why should she make breakfast for you every day simply because she gets up earlier? She's not your mommy, bro.   \n\n\nShe works just like you, it doesn't matter if she has to go later. She still works. So why do you think it's fair to put MORE work onto her just because you can't get up earlier and make your own breakfast, or do a trade off like she said? Her suggestion of a trade-off is completely fair, reasonable, and a great compromise if you want actual good breakfast.   \n\n\nShe WOULD be doing extra work by making extra food, so your argument on YOU doing extra work and not her is null.   \n\n\nGrow up. You're partners, so act like it. If you can't do a trade off, then YOU start cooking dinner **every day** and she can cook breakfast every day. Once again, she's not your mommy. You are not a child. You are equals, and it's entirely unfair for her to do extra work.  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA but if making dinner all the time or breakfast doesn't work then agree to something else.

You\u2019re joking, right? \n\nIt is not fair at all if she does 80% of all work (mental and physical) because you\u2019re \u201dnot a morning person\u201d.

I\u2019d be questioning that assumption right now if I were you. A person who feels loved and happy in their relationship is generally glad to do something like this for their partner. The fact that she went to asking you to do something to balance it out makes me think there\u2019s an imbalance in other parts of your relationship.

The trade off could be something you do for her at another time of day that she isn't good at or suited to in some way.\n\nThat said, I think what you need to do is have a talk about expectations. If she expects 50/50 in the exact same things that should extend to things she isn't suited to temperamentally or in other ways; for example, she might hate the idea of mowing the lawn, or of some other chore that you tend do because in some way or other it's easier or more pleasant for you to do.\n\nAlso, there's the issue of just how much tally-keeping is going to be done.

If you expect her to cook a big breakfast for you every morning then you should be making her diner every evening.", "YTA, why don\u2019t you cook every dinner, and she cooks every breakfast?", "There\u2019s a lot wrong in this relationship if your own girl isn\u2019t willing to make a portion of breakfast for you when she\u2019s already in the process of cooking (breakfast food is easily cooked and adding a couple eggs, bacon, etc isn\u2019t a hassle to do) unless there is something else not being said. \n\nYou claim you make dinner pretty often so a trade off would be she makes breakfast, you make dinner (not very fair as the standard dinners are a lot more complex and time consuming than the standard breakfast usually but I\u2019m gonna digress from that) but you also say this doesn\u2019t work because you work later than her more often and then went on to say that the person who gets home first cooks dinner which means she makes dinner more often as well.\n\nIt seems like there is a serious lack of communication and both parties are upset (more so on your part from what I\u2019ve read because a lot of people here calling YTA refuse to realize that it honestly would take almost zero effort to just make some extra portions while already in the process of cooking and a healthy couple would have no issues in doing this unless the split of dinner between you two is something like 70/30 in which case she is justifiably upset as well)\n\nAll that being said, I would suggest asking if your partner would be ok with having dinner later than usual and handling that yourself if she would handle breakfast (again it\u2019s not a very fair trade off since she makes these HUGE breakfasts every morning already and could easily add an extra portion but I guess a sacrifice should be made if you really can\u2019t get yourself up in the morning.)\n\nNTA but there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on in the background that needs some working on because a happy relationship doesn\u2019t always work in an X for Y way, sometimes you just do for the person and don\u2019t need something in return because when you love someone it\u2019s not about what you can get for something it\u2019s about giving and trying to make your person happy.", "NTA - like you said it\u2019s zero extra effort for her to throw in a couple extra sausages etc. You should be doing all the washing&tidying up after so you\u2019re also sharing the breakfast labour (and you\u2019ll be more awake then too).", "NTA.

For the most part things are really good and I plan to propose soon and hopefully have at least a couple of kids with her.\n\nHowever we've run up against a conflict.\n\nShe's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast. She likes a huge breakfast in the morning. She usually has eggs, either French toast or pancakes, hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes, and sausage or bacon. Sometimes on weekends it's ham or steak. She eats almost nothing for lunch and usually has a smallish dinner but she loves a huge breakfast.\n\nMeanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning.\n\nHowever my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her \"no\" but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her.\n\nShe seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return. But I think that since she makes a huge breakfast for herself every morning anyway that throwing an extra portion of whatever she's making on for me would take next-to no effort on her part, so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That\u2019s not equal, at all.\n\nFor that reason, domestic chores are where I will absolutely insist there is a tit for every tat. Any other types of chores? Happy to do you a solid and throw in extra work to keep things warm and fuzzy, I don\u2019t care and I\u2019m not keeping score.

Nor would I. It's like making another coffee for someone as they walk in and see you making a coffee to me. \n\nI get things being an equilibrium to a degree. I always find people who are focused on I did this you should do this. \n\nI guess being complimentary in actions and thoughts doesn't come naturally to all. \n\nOne may do more cleaning but the other does the hard labour jobs outside.

But that is because I love my partner, he works ridiculously hard, and he does amazing things for me all the time without expecting anything in return.\n\nSo yes, I am confused why people wouldn't want to do kind things for their partner just because.\n\nBut the vibe I am getting is that OP does not do enough kind things for his partner or show her that he loves and appreciates her.", "OP is kind of a dick for pushing the issue after the initial ask but gf seems to treat the relationship as transactional, which to my mind doesn't seem like the right way to go about handling a relationship.  Personally if I was in a relationship and always up before my partner and already cooking breakfast, and they wanted me to fix something for them, I'd gladly do it because I (hopefully) love and care about them and the small amount of extra effort would be well worth seeing and hearing their gratitude each morning.  I wouldn't automatically expect them to do other chores or tasks in return, even if they explicitly offered to do so.", "It\u2019s dudette and they\u2019re in a relationship. Are you in one? There\u2019s give and take. I don\u2019t have to be asked by my SO to make extra if I\u2019m cooking for myself. I love my partner so I ask him \u201cI\u2019m making \u2018such and such. Want some?\u2019 He says yes or no thank you. He\u2019s out and about and stops at the coffee shop he calls \u2018babe, want your usual?\u2019 I do or don\u2019t. No one says I\u2019m doing this for you so I expect you to do that for me. This is why relationships don\u2019t last today. People are selfish and are me centered.", "Oh well that's a key detail to leave out!", "how would you know that", "Aahhh, I see. I should have known there was context I was missing.", "Except OP isn't doing any of those things. It sounds to me like the girlfriend is simply fed up, OP a lot has more to worry about then breakfast. He wants a life with her and she may be getting ready to check out.", "Because, according to his replies, he actually doesn't do half the evening cooking either. He said that the only chores he does is making the bed and mowing the lawn. She should be holding the line on this.", "Or maybe she doesn't want another thing for him on her plate while he barely does anything now (read his replies). The truth is most would say \"sure honey\", the fact that she didn't tells a lot.", "Exactly! \u201cHoney, throw in my laundry while you\u2019re doing yours [and the kids\u2019], it\u2019s not any extra work!", "Life experience.", "Probably reading his post and how stupid he is. That\u2019s how they came up with it. He wrote out how big of a complete loser he is without seeing the fault in how wrong he is.", "That's literally what I said", "This, yeah. My GF and I trade cooking and cleanup. In OP\u2019s case, him taking over the cleaning could well make up for the added effort it costs his GF to make breakfast for him as well as for herself.", "So they can have a couple.of.kids that she will have to take care of.", "Im willing to bet \"often\" means less than 50% here.", "It'll never be 100% even, but with one doing dinner and the other doing breakfast, it'll be more even than one doing breakfast and dinner half the time, and the other doing just dinner half the time. Plus, it's never *that* much more difficult unless you make it difficult", "Excuse me, where does it say they have already imbalanced division of labour because I read the whole thing again and did not find suggestions of this? Where does it say she already does more? He said he makes dinner in example and they do have a division of labour, was not said it's not balanced.", "And they basically JUST moved in together. It\u2019s posts like this that make me glad I\u2019m single. Not interested in spending so much of my time/life with someone like this.  Hahaha this got downvoted because I\u2019m not interested in spending time with people who don\u2019t like me \ud83d\ude02 what", "I\u2019m responding specifically to the \u2018you have to make it equal again\u2019. My vote is ESH because they both sound selfish and too focused on getting their share instead of caring for each other. Seems exhausting", "I would never think my partner asking me to make extra of something I\u2019m already cooking as them \u2018taking advantage of me\u2019. I think if you feel like your partner is taking advantage of you, your relationship has more problems. \n\nI think it\u2019s common decency to cook for all members in the household when you\u2019re cooking. \n\nThat said, I think op should also offer to cook breakfast sometimes. \n\nBut something else is up when a request like \u2018hey will you also make me a plate\u2019 is met with \u2018only if you\u2019ll do something for me\u2019.", "It literally says in the post that after gf asked if OP would do anything else to even out responsibilities, OP said no and told her it wouldn't take any extra work to make them both breakfast. And that this started a fight. Sure sounds like OP demanded it to me. \n\nAnd on top of that, OP doesn't want to contribute any more than they already are (which if you see from their comments certainly looks like less than 50% already) so your other point about equally dividing labour is off base as well. OP just wants something for free, and doesn't appreciate the work GF is putting in.", "op  told that it one of the comment", "Lol that's the perfect answer.", "Oh, so nothing to do with the actual post you're replying to then? There's literally zero evidence for the comment I previously replied to. You're supposed to read the post and base your response on the information actually provided, not just make up random shit that supports your preconceived biases", "Fair point.", "Warvation seems to be the only voice of reason among all of these replies.  She's happy to spend lots of time and energy making a huge breakfast for herself, but won't consider doing it for anybody else unless she gets something in return.  \n\nIf my girlfriend pulled that crap, I'd probably have a huge breakfast delivered every morning from that day on.  And if she asked me why I was doing it, I would say...\n\n\"YOU wanted to make breakfast for me a commercial transaction by asking for payment for it.  So I'm skipping the middle-man.  There's fewer headaches this way.\"", "I have a feeling that there\u2019s more going on here with the division of labour, and the girlfriend feeling taken advantage of. Plus, is OP going to start making requests for breakfasts? \n\nIf this is wholly due to a \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d mentality, I agree with you. But this is one of those where I get the feeling we need more info.", "You're right it's not that big of a deal to make extra breakfast and normally it'd be fine. But it woukd also annoy me if I was the only one ever making breakfast and my partner couldn't be arsed to get out of bed once to do something nice for me. \n\nLike if they offered to take an extra day making dinner would make me feel like they cared and were grateful. That's what it comes down to I think.. it's not transactional, it's just showing that you appreciate the effort.", "Read his comments. His gf is clearly doing way more, and that's probably why she's asking for a trade-off. He said that the only thing he helps with at home is making the bed and doing the yard work. Then he went on to say that actually, his gf cooks dinner usually because she gets home first. So, she works, does all of the house work too, and cooks dinner essentially every night.   \n\n\nSo basically, he's not doing much to help his gf AND he expects her to do more work. In this case, I understand his gf looking for something fair because she's very clearly already being treated unfairly. It sounds like she's built up resentment", "Exactly, that\u2019s what I was trying to convey."]}
