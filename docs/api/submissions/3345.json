For the most part things are really good and I plan to propose soon and hopefully have at least a couple of kids with her.\n\nHowever we've run up against a conflict.\n\nShe's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast. She likes a huge breakfast in the morning. She usually has eggs, either French toast or pancakes, hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes, and sausage or bacon. Sometimes on weekends it's ham or steak. She eats almost nothing for lunch and usually has a smallish dinner but she loves a huge breakfast.\n\nMeanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning.\n\nHowever my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her \"no\" but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her.\n\nShe seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return. But I think that since she makes a huge breakfast for herself every morning anyway that throwing an extra portion of whatever she's making on for me would take next-to no effort on her part, so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?", "created_utc": 1669547862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5ys4j/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_start_making_me/", "score": 16801, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s already up so she should be the one to pack bags and lunches and cook Everyone breakfast?  She\u2019s breastfeeding so you never need to cover the night wake ups?  She\u2019s home earlier \u201coften\u201d and that\u2019s the person who starts dinner and picks up the kids and deals with the homework but you\u2019re totally doing 50/50. She\u2019s washing her clothes anyway so it\u2019s no extra effort to put yours in - then fold them and put them away cause she\u2019s doing that for the rest of the load right? \n\nIt sounds like she already feels like she\u2019s doing more and now you\u2019re asking for something else.  If it would require effort and energy for you to do it, it requires effort and energy for her to do it. This may be a small amount of additional energy for this one thing but it makes me wonder if she\u2019s already feeling that she\u2019s putting out significantly more effort for household duties as it stands.\n\nEdit - thanks for the awards!\n\nOh. And YTA", "You are not an asshole for asking. You are absolutely an asshole for insisting after she made a very reasonable suggestion. You already share dinner cooking responsibilities, so it is perfectly reasonable to request the same for breakfast. You just want to take advantage of the fact she is up. And no it isn't just slapping down some extra food. All the planning and prep work also changes. So no, it isn't just slap on a couple of extra things and call it good. If you don't want to share in that work too, then I don't blame her at all for turning you down.\n\nYTA", "I\u2019m trying to understand because I didn\u2019t get it.\nYou want her to maker breakfast for two in the morning because you don\u2019t have the strength to but it\u2019s not supposed to count as a chore like the rest?", "YTA LMFAO  \n\n\n\"Oh so we'll take turns making breakfast for each other? :D\"  \"Oh.. no you'll just make food for me, it's no extra effort for you anyways\"  \n\n\nThe CHEEK on you.", "Ah, I remember the early days of counting up all you do and all they do.

Not true, nor is the cost.\n\nThere's bound to be a way to sort it but it's about your attitudes.\n\nGood luck.", ">so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?\n\n\n\nBecause you are asking her to do something for you. Like, obviously you should offer do something for her too. If she makes breakfast every morning you do dinner every night, or some other mutually agreed upon task.

If you want her to cook you breakfast every morning, you should cook dinner every night.", "YTA - She gets up in the morning and puts in time and effort to make herself the breakfast she wants, and you want in for zero in exchange because you cbf getting up early enough? Not even occasionally to balance it out? You get a full cooked breakfast every morning and she gets.. to make herself a full cooked breakfast every morning.", "If waking up 30 min earlier and helping make breakfast feels impossible\u2014and you somehow think you\u2019ll have kids someday and preserve this childish preference\u2014then YTA.", "I\u2019m a professional chef. I\u2019m just like your girlfriend. Breakfast is my main meal. I nibble at work as I have to taste with sample spoons what I cook. I wake up early for personal time and cooking. My husband skips breakfast. \n\nIf he TOLD me to cook him breakfast (you didn\u2019t ask because no wasn\u2019t an option) it would be extra work. Planning it out, shredding twice as many potatoes, doing twice as much work for French toast, keeping it warm.. it\u2019s not me time now. \n\nIt\u2019s more work. And is expected. And doesn\u2019t leave me the option of doing something weird when I feel like it. Like eating leftover pizza or a tuna sandwich. \n\nSo yep there would be compromise if I did this extra work. \n\nHusband would do it every other day or make all dinners (why not? Just double what you are making for yourself!) \n\nWhat would you do if you had no girlfriend and wanted a hot breakfast?\n\nDo that or compromise. It actually is double the work, prep, and shopping and removes the days when you don\u2019t feel like it and eat a slice of pie \n\nIt\u2019s forced and less fun and more work. That\u2019s fine if you pick up somewhere else. You are eating dinner anyway. You are awake at dinner and are a night person. So she does breakfast you do dinner. \n\nYou do the dishes at breakfast? \n\nRight now you say she does breakfast daily and dinner every other night as well. \n\nSweet deal for you. Doesn\u2019t work for her.\n\nAlso thanks for the upvotes and award!", "She is right. If she feels that you should do extra for breakfast, then you should. If she didn't feel it, then, you shouldn't. There is no absolute rule here. What matters is whether you adapt yourselves for each other or not. Trying to force a thought or behavior is a red flag and mostly a deal breaker.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nIt's not about how much work it takes. It's about not letting a precedent be set of an unfair division of labor in an equal relationship.", "YTA. If you offered to make every dinner while she makes everybreakfast, that would be a reasonable compromise.", "YTA, not for asking, but for how you reacted when she said no. You tried to persuade her into doing it by saying how easy you think it is, and ignored her reasonable compromise.", "Simple compromise is you always make dinner for her, and she always makes breakfast for you. Seems fair to me", "YTA.\n\nOnly if you make her dinner every night. I mean, you're already cooking for yourself, what's an extra portion thrown in? Right?", "YTA but not for asking her to make breakfast like you worded it. If was perfectly fine for you to ask her if she would be willing to do it for you, but she can certainly say no. She doesn't owe it to you just cause she's awake or cause she's already cooking.\n\nYou became the AH when that answer wasn't okay with you, you weren't willing to do anything in return for her extra work and you weren't willing to accept her answer. That's just selfish.\n\nWe all make choices for ourselves, you might not be a morning person, but you can put on your big boy pants and figure out a way to get up and make yourself breakfast if it's important to you. Go to bed earlier, stop drinking so much caffeine, prep your breakfast the night before. The possibilities are endless, be an adult and figure it out.", "YTA\n\nNot everything can easily be doubled up and she\u2019s got a point about what will be more effort every morning.", "How about you do the dishes after every breakfast?", "YTA for refusing to take another task on to equal it out. If she\u2019s ALWAYS cooking you breakfast, you should ALWAYS be making dinner. If she wants to cook dinner you should always wash the dishes. That\u2019s fair play.", "Info: why can't you just always make dinner instead?", "YTA. \n\nYou could pitch in by offering to do something else, that would equal the amount of effort she'd put into making breakfast for the both of you.", "You'll soon become a morning person if you have kids cause they wake up early. Or will you delegate their care to your GF as you're not a morning person? Just set your alarm & cook breakfast, it's not that hard.", "Huh?? You're definitely the asshole here, and you not understanding that is ridiculous. She's right, if you trade off making dinner, why should she make breakfast for you every day simply because she gets up earlier? She's not your mommy, bro.   \n\n\nShe works just like you, it doesn't matter if she has to go later. She still works. So why do you think it's fair to put MORE work onto her just because you can't get up earlier and make your own breakfast, or do a trade off like she said? Her suggestion of a trade-off is completely fair, reasonable, and a great compromise if you want actual good breakfast.   \n\n\nShe WOULD be doing extra work by making extra food, so your argument on YOU doing extra work and not her is null.   \n\n\nGrow up. You're partners, so act like it. If you can't do a trade off, then YOU start cooking dinner **every day** and she can cook breakfast every day. Once again, she's not your mommy. You are not a child. You are equals, and it's entirely unfair for her to do extra work.  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA but if making dinner all the time or breakfast doesn't work then agree to something else.

Why didn't you offer to just take over dinner then", "YTA \n\nIf you want her to make all of the breakfasts then you should make all of the dinners", "YTA.  GF making you breakfast should figure into the division of labor.  It is extra work.  It is a little weird that you are even questioning this.  Just ask her what she wants you to do and you can see if you even mind.

You\u2019re joking, right? \n\nIt is not fair at all if she does 80% of all work (mental and physical) because you\u2019re \u201dnot a morning person\u201d.

No harm in asking but you become TA by refusing to offer any kind of kindness in return, minimizing the effort it would take her to cook for you, and then bringing up the fact that you already make dinner *sometimes* (which she also does).

She makes you both breakfast every morning, you make you both dinner every evening. It's not rocket science.", "YTA she offered to trade off like you do for dinner and you refused. If you want a big breakfast so bad make it yourself. Imagine being a full ass adult and feeling this entitled.", "She clearly stated the she wants a trade off.

I\u2019d be questioning that assumption right now if I were you. A person who feels loved and happy in their relationship is generally glad to do something like this for their partner. The fact that she went to asking you to do something to balance it out makes me think there\u2019s an imbalance in other parts of your relationship.

I don't know, maybe I'm just different, I lived with an ex who had to leave the house by 6:am, and I got up every morning to make him breakfast, because if I didn't he wouldn't have eaten.

You, because you should at least be thinking about balance. The trade off could be something you do for her at another time of day that she isn't good at or suited to in some way.\n\nThat said, I think what you need to do is have a talk about expectations. If she expects 50/50 in the exact same things that should extend to things she isn't suited to temperamentally or in other ways; for example, she might hate the idea of mowing the lawn, or of some other chore that you tend do because in some way or other it's easier or more pleasant for you to do.\n\nAlso, there's the issue of just how much tally-keeping is going to be done. If one of you generally does more of one thing or another, it should be fine as long as there is an overall feeling of fairness and balance. A one-to-one bartering of chores seems to me something that would become stifling and a seed for arguments and resentment over time. \n\nI think an awareness of trying to be fair overall is the important thing, as is a general attitude of wanting to be helpful and make your SO's life a bit easier and pleasant.

If you expect her to cook a big breakfast for you every morning then you should be making her diner every evening.", "YTA, why don\u2019t you cook every dinner, and she cooks every breakfast?", "There\u2019s a lot wrong in this relationship if your own girl isn\u2019t willing to make a portion of breakfast for you when she\u2019s already in the process of cooking (breakfast food is easily cooked and adding a couple eggs, bacon, etc isn\u2019t a hassle to do) unless there is something else not being said. \n\nYou claim you make dinner pretty often so a trade off would be she makes breakfast, you make dinner (not very fair as the standard dinners are a lot more complex and time consuming than the standard breakfast usually but I\u2019m gonna digress from that) but you also say this doesn\u2019t work because you work later than her more often and then went on to say that the person who gets home first cooks dinner which means she makes dinner more often as well.\n\nIt seems like there is a serious lack of communication and both parties are upset (more so on your part from what I\u2019ve read because a lot of people here calling YTA refuse to realize that it honestly would take almost zero effort to just make some extra portions while already in the process of cooking and a healthy couple would have no issues in doing this unless the split of dinner between you two is something like 70/30 in which case she is justifiably upset as well)\n\nAll that being said, I would suggest asking if your partner would be ok with having dinner later than usual and handling that yourself if she would handle breakfast (again it\u2019s not a very fair trade off since she makes these HUGE breakfasts every morning already and could easily add an extra portion but I guess a sacrifice should be made if you really can\u2019t get yourself up in the morning.)\n\nNTA but there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on in the background that needs some working on because a happy relationship doesn\u2019t always work in an X for Y way, sometimes you just do for the person and don\u2019t need something in return because when you love someone it\u2019s not about what you can get for something it\u2019s about giving and trying to make your person happy.", "NTA - like you said it\u2019s zero extra effort for her to throw in a couple extra sausages etc. You should be doing all the washing&tidying up after so you\u2019re also sharing the breakfast labour (and you\u2019ll be more awake then too).", "NTA.

For the most part things are really good and I plan to propose soon and hopefully have at least a couple of kids with her.\n\nHowever we've run up against a conflict.\n\nShe's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast. She likes a huge breakfast in the morning. She usually has eggs, either French toast or pancakes, hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes, and sausage or bacon. Sometimes on weekends it's ham or steak. She eats almost nothing for lunch and usually has a smallish dinner but she loves a huge breakfast.\n\nMeanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning.\n\nHowever my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her \"no\" but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her.\n\nShe seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return. But I think that since she makes a huge breakfast for herself every morning anyway that throwing an extra portion of whatever she's making on for me would take next-to no effort on her part, so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As a morning person, I\u2019m usually up before anyone else (when I\u2019ve had roommates).  I usually have a meal shake for breakfast, but if I were inclined to cook up a mess of eggs, I\u2019d be more than happy to cook more for others, especially if they were known to not be as perky in the morning.

So if my significant other needed my help to prepare more breakfast to help him out, I cannot imagine not just agreeing to doing it.

If I were having these feelings, I sure as heck would not be remotely considering making a commitment and making babies with this guy.  Years ago, I dated a sociopathic narcissist.  (Learned what one of those were based on my experience with him.).  I had to have surgery during our time together.  He called from work to check on me and to see if I needed anything.  At the time, I had run out of dog food for my dog.  I didn\u2019t want to ask, but I was still on bed rest.  I asked if he could stop at the pet store after work for me.  I would pay him back.  He hesitated then complained that he was too busy at work and asked me why I couldn\u2019t just do it for myself.  The phone call ended soon after.  I immediately regretted even asking.  At that point, I had to strategize how to get myself up and put together enough to run an errand.  Doubled up, I made my way out of the bedroom.  I remember to this day looking at my dog and telling him, \u201cif I\u2019m stupid enough to marry him and get pregnant with his kids, I swear you\u2019re going to have to drive me to the hospital.\u201d That\u2019s when I allowed myself to admit I was dating a very selfish person and it would only get worse from here.

One might even do those extra eggs and hashbrowns, if your partner makes you feel loved by doing similar \"labors of love\".\n\nBut every relationship I know that did not negotiate things clearly fell into super gendered roles when the romance mellowed out, and you bet the \"if you love me, you would do this\" faction had soooo many fights about this.\n\nI watched them closely growing up, and I learned to sit down like an attorney with anyone I moved in with.", "Well said in your first paragraph.

A relationship isn't about compromise, either. Sometimes you pull and sometimes you push. That's not keeping it equal, that's doing what you can, when you can, knowing that sometimes you do a little more, and sometimes you ask of them a little more.\n\nTrying to keep the line in the middle all the time is a great way to feel entitlement (i.e. \"you need to do ...\") or feel resentment (i.e. \"why do I have to ...\"). Bringing this back to OP, and my karma ruining judgement, getting 3 months into a relationship with a live-in partner is a great time to find this out. It's probably not great for either one of them.\n\nHopefully this opens up some lines of communication about the issue, and figure out if OP and his partner can trust each other and give and take, instead of trying to balance the scales.", "Op never says what he does for gf.", "That's what has me perplexed.

My husband and I have a relationship that feels transactional a lot\u2026 from bills to cooking/cleaning and that can cause resentment for sure.

When each person truly cares for the other, each shouldn't mind doing something extra once in awhile because it will, at some point, be returned. Or should be. An exact 50/50 split of tasks is unrealistic to achieve, but at times one partner will be doing more based on circumstances, and at other times, the other will do more based on circumstances. It's ebb and flow, give and take. It's never going to be 50/50 all the time, forever. People need to be flexible. For example, I have a chronic illness. When I feel good, I love to cook and cook dinner most of the time. When I'm not feeling well, my husband cooks. It might just be hot dogs or spaghetti, but he gladly does it. I love to cook, so I don't mind doing the majority of it most of the time. He and my son clean up after dinner. To me, that's a fair split, even though it takes more time to cook.

More recent research, though, shows that's not really true: older people *need* as much sleep (if not slightly more, because the repair and regeneration that *does* happen can take longer and be more resource-intensive), but often have a harder time *getting* it. They wake up more often, sleep less deeply, and wake earlier in the morning. \n\nI\u2019ve seen conflicting research as to why many older people *feel* like they need less sleep, even when they (in the studies I\u2019ve seen) objectively benefit from more than they normally get.

If he asks, I\u2019ll make his too. And I predominantly cook dinners. We do pretty much everything else together- cleaning inside and out, groceries, he takes trash out, I put the new bag in, whatever. He only does the labor on his own like cutting the grass.

Moving in together has growing pains. It\u2019s fine but you can\u2019t let it fester.
