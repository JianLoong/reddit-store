{"id": 8920, "submission_id": "10ri5l2", "title": "AITA for throwing out my daughters old blanket her deceased father gave her?", "selftext": "Hey all. I need unbiased opinions. My ex-husband and daughters father passed away when my daughter was 9, my husband had a heart attack while home alone with my daughter. My daughter suffered extreme trauma to the point where she wouldn\u2019t talk. After consulting with a therapist, he suggested we move somewhere that won\u2019t constantly remind my daughter of what happened. We ended up moving and in the process I sold majority of his stuff, only leaving about a box worths. My daughter though, decided to keep a blanket my husband got her on their father-daughter trip to Mexico. She kept the blanket and slept with it everyday. Eventually through therapy she got better and started to carry on a more normal life. Now, she\u2019s 20 in college and doing just fine.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the issue. The blanket is about 13 years old and looks like a rag, it\u2019s stained with rips and a completely different color than it originally was, the blanket is completely worn out by a few years. My daughter also recently got her first apartment and moved out of her college dorms, she basically told me to keep everything except the furniture, since \u201c it\u2019s all old and from High school and I don\u2019t need it anymore\u201d she recently picked up the furniture and I decided to go through her old stuff. I eventually found the blanket. When she left for college she left it here and even when she came back for break she never slept with it anymore, just randomly placed it in her closet. Obviously she didn\u2019t want it anymore so I threw it out.\n\n Fast forward to now. She spontaneously visited for the weekend (hour drive) we were having a nice time when during dinner I reminded her about the blanket and laughed that I threw it out if she didn\u2019t mind. Her mood changed from laughing and having fun to complete psycho. She yelled about how could I throw the blanket out knowing how much it meant to her and that it was the only reminder she had of her dad. I told her about the box of things and that she left the blanket here. She then left without saying another word. She ended up blocking my phone number and all forms of contact. She then got my and his family involved to the point where they kept calling me just to tell me I\u2019m a horrible mother. Eventually my ex MIL called saying my daughter was never going to speak to me again and that I deserved it. I really don\u2019t feel that way, she didn\u2019t even remember the blanket. I believe she\u2019s just doing this for attention and to make me look bad. Which is why I\u2019m posting here for unbiased opinions.", "created_utc": 1675316618, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ri5l2/aita_for_throwing_out_my_daughters_old_blanket/", "score": 530, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I really can't even begin to understand how you look at your child's special blanket and think \"that's trash\" no matter how long it's been in storage. Let alone to laugh about it and think that your child's hurt feelings are *to make you look bad*.

You knew this meant the world to her, YOU ARE A HORRIBLE MOTHER. I feel so bad for your daughter, I doubt she\u2019ll ever forgive you and if she does, it definitely will take a long time specially since you don\u2019t feel bad for what you did.", "YTA. Don\u2019t throw out sentimental items unless told explicitly to do so. What harm was it doing, sitting folded on a shelf? This has shades of \u201cwell she should be over it by now!\u201d which is fucked up.", "YTA. Memories are associated with other senses. Her father is gone and you took away a token of her core memories and comfort. And then laughed in her face. Shameful", "Unbiased? \n\nYTA. \n\nIt was a momento to her and you tossed it out, then acted like it wasn't a big deal. How could you not see her sleep with it every night as a child and not realize this, even when you found it left behind?\n\nYou might honestly be screwed here. She's gone no contact.

It was a memory of her father and it helped her through her trauma, even if it was old and raggedy it still most likely had a place in her heart. I hope you\u2019re able to find a way to apologise and resolve this with her if you choose to do so.", "YTA. How could you not be? It doesn't matter what it looks like or if she uses it. How could you be so callous? And to LAUGH about it? Were you jealous of your deceased husband or something?", "YTA. For some people, certain objects of sentimental value are irreplaceable EVEN if they\u2019re not looked at or touched on a daily basis. It was a memento, not a practical object. You assumed to know what she valued, turned out to be dead wrong, and are calling her an attention seeker??  And why would you laugh about it??

I\u2019m sure you will get no sympathy here.", "YTA and a psycho.", "YTA and I think you know it, else you would not have spent your post justifying your actions. Just because she disnt sleep with it any more didn't mean she didnt cherish it... and given her reaction, I suspect you knew how she'd react.

Then you have the audacity to tell her, to her face, \"if she didn't mind\"? I'm pissed off for her and I don't even know you. Then you think she's doing it for attention, how disconnected are you from your daughter?\n\n\nIt seems more like to me that you didn't want reminders of her father around anymore, whether it be that you are jealous of it, or something else you aren't revealing, but either way, she has every right to cut you out of her life for that.\n\n\nIf I were you, I'd be jumping on any chance I'd get to speak with her again and make her very well aware how badly you messed up.\n\n\nAnd btw, YTA.", "My unbiased opinion is that YTA for throwing out an item of such obvious sentimental significance without a word to her first.

YTA", "The blanket wasn't yours to throw out. Just because she was in college doesn't mean that it had no more meaning left. I also don't like how your post immediately concludes that \" I believe she\u2019s just doing this for attention and to make me look bad.\" Is your relationship with your daughter really this bad?\n\nYTA and you need to look at this relationship holistically. The blanket is only one part of what I suspect is a complicated relationship that needs a lot of help.", "Having my father being deceased for several years now, if my mother ever threw anything of mine away that was related to him without asking, no contact for life would the the absolute minimum.

You threw away a cherished object and she's mad about it because it was not yours to throw away. Doesn't that make more sense than her \"making you look bad\"?\n\nYTA for throwing it away and YTA again for thinking this is about you.", "You knew this was a YTA move, 100%. That\u2019s why you brought it up in the way you did joking about throwing it out and claiming you knew she wouldn\u2019t mind. Completely without another thought to anyone but yourself. \n\nNow you\u2019re fishing for N T As so you can make yourself feel better and put the blame all on her (your claim of her doing this just to get attention and make you look bad because of course you think you\u2019re the victim). \n\nJudging from how coldly you said you did all of this in your own words, it sounds like your daughter has a narcissistic parent. I had one of those and going complete non-communicative was the best thing I ever did. Sounds like she thought so too. I highly doubt this is the only reason.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t even think to ask her if she wanted to keep it?!? It was the one thing she had left that had a special meaning to her.

Why would you think that would be okay to throw away. You knew better and you did it anyway. \n\n100% guarantee she never forgot about the blanket, she just didn\u2019t think about it during a move with so many other pieces. She also probably though it was safe, no matter what. It would always be there because you both knew how important it was. \n\nWhy would you think she is doing it for attention?

You laughed!  And said \"if she didn't mind?\"  WTF, her opinion didn't matter at all to you. You had thrown it out already, and you find out it funny that you did so.

What else have you don't to suppress the memory for her father, your ex-husband?", "YTA \n\nYou knew exactly what that blanket meant to her and got rid of it anyway.

I need unbiased opinions. My ex-husband and daughters father passed away when my daughter was 9, my husband had a heart attack while home alone with my daughter. My daughter suffered extreme trauma to the point where she wouldn\u2019t talk. After consulting with a therapist, he suggested we move somewhere that won\u2019t constantly remind my daughter of what happened. We ended up moving and in the process I sold majority of his stuff, only leaving about a box worths. My daughter though, decided to keep a blanket my husband got her on their father-daughter trip to Mexico. She kept the blanket and slept with it everyday. Eventually through therapy she got better and started to carry on a more normal life. Now, she\u2019s 20 in college and doing just fine.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the issue. The blanket is about 13 years old and looks like a rag, it\u2019s stained with rips and a completely different color than it originally was, the blanket is completely worn out by a few years. My daughter also recently got her first apartment and moved out of her college dorms, she basically told me to keep everything except the furniture, since \u201c it\u2019s all old and from High school and I don\u2019t need it anymore\u201d she recently picked up the furniture and I decided to go through her old stuff. I eventually found the blanket. When she left for college she left it here and even when she came back for break she never slept with it anymore, just randomly placed it in her closet. Obviously she didn\u2019t want it anymore so I threw it out.\n\n Fast forward to now. She spontaneously visited for the weekend (hour drive) we were having a nice time when during dinner I reminded her about the blanket and laughed that I threw it out if she didn\u2019t mind. Her mood changed from laughing and having fun to complete psycho. She yelled about how could I throw the blanket out knowing how much it meant to her and that it was the only reminder she had of her dad. I told her about the box of things and that she left the blanket here. She then left without saying another word. She ended up blocking my phone number and all forms of contact. She then got my and his family involved to the point where they kept calling me just to tell me I\u2019m a horrible mother. Eventually my ex MIL called saying my daughter was never going to speak to me again and that I deserved it. I really don\u2019t feel that way, she didn\u2019t even remember the blanket. I believe she\u2019s just doing this for attention and to make me look bad. Which is why I\u2019m posting here for unbiased opinions.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Is there more to the story? \n\nJust the way you treat your daughters blanket is concerning. It was her last piece of her father and her connection to him. \n\nYTA", "YTA, i still sleep with my childhood blanket (and is as disgusting as your daughters) and would honestly never speak to my mother again if she just threw it away AND THEN LAUGHED", "YTA on many levels.  You knew how important this was to her, yet you threw it away.  Then you laughed about it.  \n\nYou write that her response to clearing out the room was to keep everything except the furniture. So why did you throw away other things?  This is a most disrespectful thing to throw another persons belongings  away. Complete disregard for their feelings. When you add the importance of this blanket, what you did was horrendous. AND YOU LAUGHED!\n\nIf you didn\u2019t want these things that your daughter told you to keep, you should have told her she needed to come collect her belongings she asked you to keep.", "YTA. This blanket obviously would have had sentimental.value to her! You threw away something that reminded her of her dad! And did she \"go psycho\"really? Or did she just express how she was feeling? You seem to be showing a lack of awareness of how much that meant to her", "I have my grandma's shawl and my dad's wallet. My husband was helping me clean the closet and saw the shawl forgot what it was (it's folded) and was about to donate it but he thought to ask because it was not his. This is a good thing because I keep my dad's wallet inside my grandma's shawl and he would have accidentally donated the two most important mementos of my loved ones I have.", "YTA. \n\nShe would be completely in the right to never have any contact with you again.", "*Without question* YTA. Taking initiative and throwing away something you *knew* was your daughter's only memento of her late father without even thinking to ask her about it, and then breaking the news to her in a way that practically *mocked* the idea of it even being important to her at all? She doesn't have to do a damn thing to make you look bad; you've done that yourself.", "What the fuck why would you disrespect someone else's property like that?\n\nIt's not your shit to do with as you please. Just because she doesn't use it constantly doesn't mean she wanted to throw it out.\n\nWhat else have you done to piss her off so much she decided to cut you out of her life? Disrespected her in other ways?\n\n# Being a parent does not give you the right to get rid of your kids' stuff as you please. \n\nYou're an Asshole.", "YTA", "YATA she's still grieving the loss of her father. You didn't care about her process, you called her psycho while she was going through a deep sense of loss all over again. Honestly you seem to be a bad mother.", "Yeah, I refuse to believe this woman thinks there is a question of her being the asshole. She obviously is. I can\u2019t imagine this is the first cruel thing mother has ever done.", "and then laughing about it in her face!??!??!??? i would have blocked her and never talk to her again", "Yeah let\u2019s all laugh about how OP lost her daughter because she was so focused on the blanket was too ugly for her to be kept in a corner of her house \ud83d\ude02", "I have 3 blankies from when I was little. Two are extremely sentimental to me. One is literally ripped in half (my dog ate its head, lol) and the other has it's stuffing coming out the back of its head.\n\nMy mother tried throwing one of them out one day after it went through the wash and I literally dug through the trash for it. I have them safely tucked away now, but if my mother ever tried getting rid of them again because they looked worn and ratty, I would be so, so heartbroken.\n\nOP is a massive AH to do something so cruel to their daughter. If I were their daughter, I wouldn't speak to OP ever again either.", "My money is that she thought it would be easier to get forgiveness than permission. Might be that she\u2019s used to getting a certain amount of forgiveness? And this time\u2026 Went way too far.", "Don\u2019t be sorry. OP is such a narcissist she thinks her daughter\u2019s reaction is to make her look bad and \u201cattention seeking\u201d. OP is not sorry for what they did", "I can see why he was the ex-husband", "Yeah but she comments that her daughter 'went psycho' like... Hellooooo.\n\nI have a feeling this was the final straw in a series of previous AH behaviour.", "My childhood horse, and friend, passed away and my mom sold his saddle. I was crushed. It was on that saddle I felt his big lungs inhale and exhale... Could feel all his muscles working below it... I sat on that saddle on all our rides together... It was molded to fit him perfectly, and was a one of a kind and quality item... I still remember the way it smelled, and how I'd wash and condition the leather. It had a beautiful textured leg panel... I even offered to buy it from her in installments, but nope, she sold it. I was so sad. I know it was valuable, but my parents are fairly well off and didn't need the extra money to get by. I believe it even still smelled like him a little.", "Most likely. But I also feel like everybody knew how much she loved that blanket. The entire family probably knew that blanket.", "I mean OP says she thinks daughter is doing this for attention and to make her look bad, so...\n\nYeah there is no way this is some one off or genuine mistake.", "And even then, why would you bring it up at dinner?  \nIf she'd genuinely forgotten about it, why remind her only to tell her it was long gone? If OP had just thrown it out and kept her mouth shut, it wouldn't be so obvious that she did it specifically to get a reaction from her daughter.  \nShe wanted her daughter to know she'd thrown it out. She wanted to hurt her. She wanted her to make a scene at dinner.  \nWhat an AH.", "Fucking literally. I have a pair of pants that I wore the day I took my childhood dog, who was there for me throughout my childhood trauma, to be put down. It has her fur and smell all over them. I put them in a plastic bag and up on a shelf in my closet to keep it safe. \n\nIt feels so ridiculous but they\u2019re special to me. I would lose it if someone tossed them out.", "It\u2019s not even a mistake like a donation box or something. When asked about what should happen to her stuff her daughter said \u201ckeep everything except for the furniture. It\u2019s old and I don\u2019t like it anymore\u201d. She picked up the furniture to donate I\u2019m assuming or toss it and assumed everything else would be safe. The mom specifically went through the remaining stuff and decided to throw away the blanket by her own choice and touch nothing else.", "Saw another commenter state that it wasn\u2019t her ex at all, but her second husband wanted her to refer to him as such. \n\nSo he wasn\u2019t an ex at all. OP is just a massive AH and I can imagine this isn\u2019t the first issue the daughter has had to put up with.", "I quote OP:\n\n\n\"We were still together when he passed? He\u2019s my ex since I got remarried and my husband prefers the term ex.\"", "OP says they\u2019re an \u201cex\u201d because her current husband prefers she call her late husband that.", "And said she \u201cwent psycho.\u201d That\u2019s what complete assholes say in order to devalue and delegitimize their person\u2019s very understandable upset reaction to the awful shit they do.", "It\u2019s 100% a manipulation thing. Possibly narcissistic. \n\nLike how could you be that cold to your own child?", "Love that show! Octavia was a favorite! However it was Blodreina, so might be something different? No clue.", "Okay, just the biggest hug to you.", "Well\u2026.then OP sounds even worse, but then makes me think it\u2019s maybe her own trauma that made her dispose of the blanket", "Winners all around. What kind of pathetic creep insists a widow imply to people that her dead husband was her ex to spare their fragile ego? Daughter probably has every reason to want to get away from the both of them.", "Not only are YTA for just tossing the blanket instead of asking, but your husband is an insecure AH for preferring ex, which he has to know makes people assume you got divorced.", "I think it was jealousy about her emotional attachment to dad. Her motto: Let's purge dad from her life, he's gone anyway.", "I have a blanket I\u2019ve had for years. I don\u2019t recall where i bought it or when but it\u2019s starting to show it\u2019s age. Nothing to terrible just a tear or two here and there. But I\u2019ve told my wife I\u2019m not throwing it out (the topic has come up) I\u2019m going to have it made into blankets when the kids start arriving in the next couple of years as I don\u2019t have a lot of heirlooms I can offer them. It\u2019s a good way of refreshing older material.", "I can see where you\u2019re coming from and agree. Anything done with it should have been okayed first but there are other options besides just throwing it out. \n\nThat connection to an ancestor can be something that people appreciate down the line so I\u2019d put that down to a case by case situation. I have keepsakes from my grandparents that will mean absolutely nothing to my children but I\u2019ll leave it up to them to make that decision. But, you do help to support the idea that this is a complex thing to make a decision on and \u201chaha I\u2019ve thrown it out\u201d was a colossal error on OP\u2019s part, she should have left it alone or discussed it before taking any action.", "Wow. \nAlthough I worked with  a woman that referred to her dead husband as The Man Who Inconsiderately Left Me . It confused the hell out of people when they found out he had died and not run off as many assumed.", "That's really messed up", "That\u2019s batshit.", "I was looking for this information, did I miss it?", "Yeah I definitely see that but usually the items that future generations will care about are things that will last like jewelry, dishes/serving dishes, silver, furniture. The blanket is already falling apart, it just won\u2019t have value to someone else. Like you said she should\u2019ve left it alone or asked her daughter.", "Oh goodness. Was she normally quite a dry humoured person? Or was that out of character for her?", "Oh I love this !", "It\u2019s in OP\u2019s comments.", "Honestly I believe it was because she couldn't  cope after her husband died suddenly at a relatively young age (47) . It was like it was easier to pretend he left her and their children than to admit he died."]}
