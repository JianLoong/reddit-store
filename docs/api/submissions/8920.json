{"id": 8920, "submission_id": "10ri5l2", "title": "AITA for throwing out my daughters old blanket her deceased father gave her?", "selftext": "Hey all. I need unbiased opinions. My ex-husband and daughters father passed away when my daughter was 9, my husband had a heart attack while home alone with my daughter. My daughter suffered extreme trauma to the point where she wouldn\u2019t talk. After consulting with a therapist, he suggested we move somewhere that won\u2019t constantly remind my daughter of what happened. We ended up moving and in the process I sold majority of his stuff, only leaving about a box worths. My daughter though, decided to keep a blanket my husband got her on their father-daughter trip to Mexico. She kept the blanket and slept with it everyday. Eventually through therapy she got better and started to carry on a more normal life. Now, she\u2019s 20 in college and doing just fine.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the issue. The blanket is about 13 years old and looks like a rag, it\u2019s stained with rips and a completely different color than it originally was, the blanket is completely worn out by a few years. My daughter also recently got her first apartment and moved out of her college dorms, she basically told me to keep everything except the furniture, since \u201c it\u2019s all old and from High school and I don\u2019t need it anymore\u201d she recently picked up the furniture and I decided to go through her old stuff. I eventually found the blanket. When she left for college she left it here and even when she came back for break she never slept with it anymore, just randomly placed it in her closet. Obviously she didn\u2019t want it anymore so I threw it out.\n\n Fast forward to now. She spontaneously visited for the weekend (hour drive) we were having a nice time when during dinner I reminded her about the blanket and laughed that I threw it out if she didn\u2019t mind. Her mood changed from laughing and having fun to complete psycho. She yelled about how could I throw the blanket out knowing how much it meant to her and that it was the only reminder she had of her dad. I told her about the box of things and that she left the blanket here. She then left without saying another word. She ended up blocking my phone number and all forms of contact. She then got my and his family involved to the point where they kept calling me just to tell me I\u2019m a horrible mother. Eventually my ex MIL called saying my daughter was never going to speak to me again and that I deserved it. I really don\u2019t feel that way, she didn\u2019t even remember the blanket. I believe she\u2019s just doing this for attention and to make me look bad. Which is why I\u2019m posting here for unbiased opinions.", "created_utc": 1675316618, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ri5l2/aita_for_throwing_out_my_daughters_old_blanket/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I really can't even begin to understand how you look at your child's special blanket and think \"that's trash\" no matter how long it's been in storage. Let alone to laugh about it and think that your child's hurt feelings are *to make you look bad*.

You knew this meant the world to her, YOU ARE A HORRIBLE MOTHER. I feel so bad for your daughter, I doubt she\u2019ll ever forgive you and if she does, it definitely will take a long time specially since you don\u2019t feel bad for what you did.", "YTA. Don\u2019t throw out sentimental items unless told explicitly to do so. What harm was it doing, sitting folded on a shelf? This has shades of \u201cwell she should be over it by now!\u201d which is fucked up.", "YTA. Memories are associated with other senses. Her father is gone and you took away a token of her core memories and comfort. And then laughed in her face. Shameful", "Unbiased? \n\nYTA. \n\nIt was a momento to her and you tossed it out, then acted like it wasn't a big deal. How could you not see her sleep with it every night as a child and not realize this, even when you found it left behind?\n\nYou might honestly be screwed here. She's gone no contact.

It was a memory of her father and it helped her through her trauma, even if it was old and raggedy it still most likely had a place in her heart. I hope you\u2019re able to find a way to apologise and resolve this with her if you choose to do so.", "YTA. How could you not be? It doesn't matter what it looks like or if she uses it. How could you be so callous? And to LAUGH about it? Were you jealous of your deceased husband or something?", "YTA. For some people, certain objects of sentimental value are irreplaceable EVEN if they\u2019re not looked at or touched on a daily basis. It was a memento, not a practical object. You assumed to know what she valued, turned out to be dead wrong, and are calling her an attention seeker??  And why would you laugh about it??

I\u2019m sure you will get no sympathy here.", "YTA and a psycho.", "YTA and I think you know it, else you would not have spent your post justifying your actions. Just because she disnt sleep with it any more didn't mean she didnt cherish it... and given her reaction, I suspect you knew how she'd react.

Then you have the audacity to tell her, to her face, \"if she didn't mind\"? I'm pissed off for her and I don't even know you. Then you think she's doing it for attention, how disconnected are you from your daughter?\n\n\nIt seems more like to me that you didn't want reminders of her father around anymore, whether it be that you are jealous of it, or something else you aren't revealing, but either way, she has every right to cut you out of her life for that.\n\n\nIf I were you, I'd be jumping on any chance I'd get to speak with her again and make her very well aware how badly you messed up.\n\n\nAnd btw, YTA.", "My unbiased opinion is that YTA for throwing out an item of such obvious sentimental significance without a word to her first.

YTA", "The blanket wasn't yours to throw out. Just because she was in college doesn't mean that it had no more meaning left. I also don't like how your post immediately concludes that \" I believe she\u2019s just doing this for attention and to make me look bad.\" Is your relationship with your daughter really this bad?\n\nYTA and you need to look at this relationship holistically. The blanket is only one part of what I suspect is a complicated relationship that needs a lot of help.", "Having my father being deceased for several years now, if my mother ever threw anything of mine away that was related to him without asking, no contact for life would the the absolute minimum.

You threw away a cherished object and she's mad about it because it was not yours to throw away. Doesn't that make more sense than her \"making you look bad\"?\n\nYTA for throwing it away and YTA again for thinking this is about you.", "You knew this was a YTA move, 100%. That\u2019s why you brought it up in the way you did joking about throwing it out and claiming you knew she wouldn\u2019t mind. Completely without another thought to anyone but yourself. \n\nNow you\u2019re fishing for N T As so you can make yourself feel better and put the blame all on her (your claim of her doing this just to get attention and make you look bad because of course you think you\u2019re the victim). \n\nJudging from how coldly you said you did all of this in your own words, it sounds like your daughter has a narcissistic parent. I had one of those and going complete non-communicative was the best thing I ever did. Sounds like she thought so too. I highly doubt this is the only reason.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t even think to ask her if she wanted to keep it?!? It was the one thing she had left that had a special meaning to her.

Why would you think that would be okay to throw away. You knew better and you did it anyway. \n\n100% guarantee she never forgot about the blanket, she just didn\u2019t think about it during a move with so many other pieces. She also probably though it was safe, no matter what. It would always be there because you both knew how important it was. \n\nWhy would you think she is doing it for attention?

You laughed!  And said \"if she didn't mind?\"  WTF, her opinion didn't matter at all to you. You had thrown it out already, and you find out it funny that you did so.

What else have you don't to suppress the memory for her father, your ex-husband?", "YTA \n\nYou knew exactly what that blanket meant to her and got rid of it anyway.

I need unbiased opinions. My ex-husband and daughters father passed away when my daughter was 9, my husband had a heart attack while home alone with my daughter. My daughter suffered extreme trauma to the point where she wouldn\u2019t talk. After consulting with a therapist, he suggested we move somewhere that won\u2019t constantly remind my daughter of what happened. We ended up moving and in the process I sold majority of his stuff, only leaving about a box worths. My daughter though, decided to keep a blanket my husband got her on their father-daughter trip to Mexico. She kept the blanket and slept with it everyday. Eventually through therapy she got better and started to carry on a more normal life. Now, she\u2019s 20 in college and doing just fine.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the issue. The blanket is about 13 years old and looks like a rag, it\u2019s stained with rips and a completely different color than it originally was, the blanket is completely worn out by a few years. My daughter also recently got her first apartment and moved out of her college dorms, she basically told me to keep everything except the furniture, since \u201c it\u2019s all old and from High school and I don\u2019t need it anymore\u201d she recently picked up the furniture and I decided to go through her old stuff. I eventually found the blanket. When she left for college she left it here and even when she came back for break she never slept with it anymore, just randomly placed it in her closet. Obviously she didn\u2019t want it anymore so I threw it out.\n\n Fast forward to now. She spontaneously visited for the weekend (hour drive) we were having a nice time when during dinner I reminded her about the blanket and laughed that I threw it out if she didn\u2019t mind. Her mood changed from laughing and having fun to complete psycho. She yelled about how could I throw the blanket out knowing how much it meant to her and that it was the only reminder she had of her dad. I told her about the box of things and that she left the blanket here. She then left without saying another word. She ended up blocking my phone number and all forms of contact. She then got my and his family involved to the point where they kept calling me just to tell me I\u2019m a horrible mother. Eventually my ex MIL called saying my daughter was never going to speak to me again and that I deserved it. I really don\u2019t feel that way, she didn\u2019t even remember the blanket. I believe she\u2019s just doing this for attention and to make me look bad. Which is why I\u2019m posting here for unbiased opinions.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
