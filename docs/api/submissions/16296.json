There was a snicker from my parents, I ignored it because I didn\u2019t realize it was aimed at me, then the meal came and I only ate about a third of it, got the rest to go.

Yes. \n\nWas what you said also rude? Also yes.\n\nESH.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nThey're being unnecessarily interested and judgmental about your new diet/exercise choices. So yeah, they should back off that. Probably should stop making restaurants a big focus of socializing with you as well.\n\nBut you know you could have explained your choices and lifestyle without adding **\"so I don\u2019t end up like you two.\"**  I guess you're the type of person that thinks anything goes as a response when someone has been rude to you first.", "NTA , they started it , plain and simple , don\u2019t talk crap if you can\u2019t take it.", "NTA. They likely know that their habits are the cause of some of their health issues (I\u2019ve never been small, and at 50, my joints are paying for it - instead of mocking my daughter for wanting to be healthier, I encourage good habits without shaming her love of sugar - we\u2019re working on balance and making healthy choices), and the truth hurts sometimes. If they\u2019d not said anything, or, in particular, not vilified your desire to stay healthy and fit, you wouldn\u2019t have had to be so direct. The saddest part is that as parents, so long as it isn\u2019t something unhealthy or disordered eating, they should be happy that you\u2019re healthy and fit and taking care of yourself.", "ESH. They snipe at you, and then you snarl at them and everyone feels bad. It may be worth considering whether you have inherited unhealthy communication styles from them, and whether you could clean those up like you have with your eating habits. I get how you feel when they come after you, but just as with changing your diet, changing your reactions might make you feel better overall.", "NTA. Seems ok for them to shame you for having a healthy lifestyle; what you said was not even rude. If anything it was a bit too honest and some people can\u2019t handle blatant honesty, which you may not even have had the need to use if they hadn\u2019t been so pushy with their mockery to begin with. \nHere\u2019s what gives me ick about this: instead of praising you for being a bit better and being grateful that their daughter may not endure painful heart problems like they have, they seem to feel so ashamed that you\u2019re doing so much better, that they are trying to bring you down. Uuggghh nope, that\u2019s just not right. Parents are supposed to want what\u2019s best for you and this is clearly not the case for this particular issue.", "Woof, NTA.\n\nThis isn't a healthy/unhealthy debate. You now live a different lifestyle than the one you were raised in (which is totally healthy normal you're out in the world and making your own choices). And your parents are criticizing and mocking you for it, when it doesn't affect them in any way whatsoever.\n\nI think you returning their personal attacks with your own is understandable. It was in the moment, they were picking on you, you were highly activated.\n\nBut going forward, you need to decide what relationship you want with your parents. If you want respect for your decisions, you're going to need a different approach that disrespecting *their* choices. Because again, it's not about who's lifestyle is better. All of you deserve to live the lives you want without being constantly criticized.", "NTA\n\nPeople need to keep their mouths shut about other peoples' bodies, eating habits, and the like. \n\nI get something similar from my father, who is of course the least healthy person in our nuclear family. \n\nNothing wrong with firing right back in those circumstances. Two wrongs don't make a right, but they can make a *what the fuck ever.*", "NTA - most parents want for their children what they never had. So it\u2019s unfortunate that they are either delusional to their own health or just don\u2019t care and think you shouldn\u2019t either. Kind of baffling tbh. \n\nThe way they kept poking, it was bound to end in a fight eventually. Sounds like you\u2019d never be able to fully sidestep the situation without giving the direct answer that you did. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you aren\u2019t getting the parental support but congratulations to you for your hard work and effort into prioritizing your health.", "NTA I disagree with the E-S-H voters. They raised the issue, they started teasing then escalated to how they don't know you (in these cases it's always because they know they don't have the willpower to do what you do so they get mad and lash out at the nearest target, you) and you just ended it.", "NTA - They don't want to get in shape (their choice) but to try to shame you for it? No.", "NTA. Your parents are in denial they set you up with unhealthy habits. It might make sense to write them a letter or email explaining your new lifestyle and if they want to continue having visits and contact they'll respect your new lifestyle of agree to disagree and stop speaking to them. I can't imagine a 300lbs man thinks he's healthy or in shape.", "NTA. you aren't telling/asking them to change their lifestyle at all but you are investing in your health & frankly, they can't handle that.  You are not the AH but they certainly are.", "NTA. Our parents are our window into good and bad habits we will form as adults. It is an opportunity to glimpse into the future without a time machine. Sometimes they have good habits worth emulating, other times there are habits that we don't want to copy. This goes for everything from how you treat and raise your children to how you treat yourself.", "NTA. Your parents opened the door to this conversation by making snide comments about your eating and workout habits. All you did was be honest with them when they inquired.", "I can't figure out how to edit the post so here we are. First of all thank you to everyone who commented/offered feedback. I appreciate it. Some serious self-reflection going on and some new things to talk about with my therapist so I appreciate the outside perspective. I'm trying to grow as a person and never really realized what an opportunity my communication presents. I do want to clarify a couple of things that came up repeatedly in the comments, not that I expect it to change anyone's perspectives.\n\nI didn't say it in a harsh way or accusatory or judgmental or anything like that. I said it in as neutral/even a tone as someone saying they're going to the dog park because they want to let their dog run around and play with other dogs would say that. If I had said it in any kind of unkind way, I 100% agree I would be TA, wouldn't have wasted anyone's time with that. But I sincerely didn't. I do know thought that words alone carry weight regardless of tone so I appreciate people pointing that out. \n\nA few people said they're just jealous/salty/whatever word you want to go with. That's probably true, but I do also think it goes deeper than that. They're very controlling people and like to have everything exactly to their narrative. So the fact that I'm not willing to be the same person they want me to be is also pretty annoying to them, to put it mildly. This is far from the only thing about me they take issue with, this was just the breaking point it seems.\n\nOverall with reflection I agree, it was a shitty thing to say. I think it was partly motivated by my sincere hope they wake up one day and realize they're killing themselves because I want them to be able to live the life they want. Do I think it's likely? No of course not, I've watched them do this to themselves my whole life. But I can't not hope, you know? Obviously that doesn't excuse it. But I hope it at least explains it a little more than the character limit allowed.", "NTA -  sounds like your parents didn\u2019t like being told the truth .\n\nFor them to make fun of you and berate you for not eating as much as them stinks of jealousy. \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the daughter we raised. How dare you not want to be obese like us.\u201d \n\nNTA", "NTA at all and good for you on breaking that awful cycle. Hopefully your parents learn that they can't comment on you without getting hit back.", "NTA. If you had said it out of the blue, you would be TAH, but they backed you into a corner with their haranguing and teasing.", "NTA\n\n \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding eight years old: They started it. If they criticise your lifestyle, you get to criticise theirs.", "Something to check into, there's a chance that some obesity is due to antibiotics killing off the probiotics your digestive system needs to tell you that you're full. This leads to overeating and several other health problems.", "ESH \n\nYou need to understand something here - you aren\u2019t wrong, but you were an asshole, because will never \u201cwin\u201d this because your lifestyle is a DIRECT INDICTMENT OF THEIR LIFESTYLE AND THEIR PARENTING.\n\nYou living healthy and taking care of yourself makes them feel badly about themselves. It has nothing to do with you. \n\nNow, if you\u2019re like a cross fit paleo guy who won\u2019t stop talking about his latest ultra marathon, I can perhaps see their point, but if you\u2019re just trying to be healthy and active, just stop bringing it up with them. Grey rock them. Say you don\u2019t want to discuss it anymore. You\u2019re going to do your thing and then you\u2019re happy to talk about anything else. If they can\u2019t get a rise out of you, it won\u2019t be interesting for them to pick at. You also don\u2019t need to antagonize them (which is literally just trauma at how you were raised manifesting as like resentment now - you\u2019re angry bc you recognize they had choices and made poor ones, that impacted you and your life.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was, and low key still probably am, really angry at my parents because of raising me that way and that there were so many issues both mentally and physically that I wouldn\u2019t have had to deal with if I was raised with healthier habits.

There are far more tactful methods of saying that kind of thing.\n\nI get it though, the biggest motivator for me to grab my health by the horns was watching my dad kill himself through negligence.

I feel like they got exactly what they were looking for.\n\nOur choices are often a mirror, and make other people uncomfortable. Not uncomfortable with our choices, uncomfortable with their own. They see that they could be making different choices, you're their own child and you are able to actually live in a healthy way. So where's the excuse saying it's genetics and they have no choice? The excuse is gone. And now they can either change their ways or double down, being angry at you instead of reflective on their own behavior\nNTA.", "NTA.

I've seen almost this exact scenario play out with my own partner - his mother lives a terrible lifestyle in terms of her personal health, and he was raised with a ton of bad habits. When we first started dating, he ate loads of unhealthy pre-made meals, barely exercised, and was always snacking on sugary stuff.\n\nBut he wasn't happy with his health and his weight, so I - gently! - encouraged him to improve his lifestyle, starting with proper home-cooked meals and less snacking. He's come a really long way, barely touches surgery snacks except as a treat now and loves to cook good, wholesome meals with me. We've even recently got a gym membership together to start exercising more (we already have a dog so we do at least get out and about a fair bit).\n\nLast week, his mother came and stayed with us for two days. She bought a veritable smorgasbord of unhealthy snacks with her - I'm talking chocolates, gummies, cookies, crisps, the works - and ate the whole lot while she was staying, constantly offering them to my partner who turned most of them down. I was actually really proud of him; unlearning those childhood habits is super difficult. I smoked for years because my parents did when I was younger.\n\nSure, you probably shouldn't have made it an attack on them - their bodies, their choices etc. - but they'll have to live with the consequences of their unhealthy lifestyles and they absolutely shouldn't be shaming you for trying to do better, they should be congratulating you. A lot of parents don't want to admit that they've passed on bad habits to their kids.", "> I guess you're the type of person that thinks anything goes as a response when someone has been rude to you first.\n\nMy eyes are rolling so hard they're gonna be used as Atlaspheres in the new *Gladiators*", "I think it\u2019s crab in pot mentality.
