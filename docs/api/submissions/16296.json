Yes. \n\nWas what you said also rude? Also yes.\n\nESH.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nThey're being unnecessarily interested and judgmental about your new diet/exercise choices. So yeah, they should back off that. Probably should stop making restaurants a big focus of socializing with you as well.\n\nBut you know you could have explained your choices and lifestyle without adding **\"so I don\u2019t end up like you two.\"**  I guess you're the type of person that thinks anything goes as a response when someone has been rude to you first.", "NTA , they started it , plain and simple , don\u2019t talk crap if you can\u2019t take it.", "NTA. They likely know that their habits are the cause of some of their health issues (I\u2019ve never been small, and at 50, my joints are paying for it - instead of mocking my daughter for wanting to be healthier, I encourage good habits without shaming her love of sugar - we\u2019re working on balance and making healthy choices), and the truth hurts sometimes. If they\u2019d not said anything, or, in particular, not vilified your desire to stay healthy and fit, you wouldn\u2019t have had to be so direct. The saddest part is that as parents, so long as it isn\u2019t something unhealthy or disordered eating, they should be happy that you\u2019re healthy and fit and taking care of yourself.", "ESH. They snipe at you, and then you snarl at them and everyone feels bad. It may be worth considering whether you have inherited unhealthy communication styles from them, and whether you could clean those up like you have with your eating habits. I get how you feel when they come after you, but just as with changing your diet, changing your reactions might make you feel better overall.", "NTA. Seems ok for them to shame you for having a healthy lifestyle; what you said was not even rude. If anything it was a bit too honest and some people can\u2019t handle blatant honesty, which you may not even have had the need to use if they hadn\u2019t been so pushy with their mockery to begin with. \nHere\u2019s what gives me ick about this: instead of praising you for being a bit better and being grateful that their daughter may not endure painful heart problems like they have, they seem to feel so ashamed that you\u2019re doing so much better, that they are trying to bring you down. Uuggghh nope, that\u2019s just not right. Parents are supposed to want what\u2019s best for you and this is clearly not the case for this particular issue.", "Woof, NTA.\n\nThis isn't a healthy/unhealthy debate. You now live a different lifestyle than the one you were raised in (which is totally healthy normal you're out in the world and making your own choices). And your parents are criticizing and mocking you for it, when it doesn't affect them in any way whatsoever.\n\nI think you returning their personal attacks with your own is understandable. It was in the moment, they were picking on you, you were highly activated.\n\nBut going forward, you need to decide what relationship you want with your parents. If you want respect for your decisions, you're going to need a different approach that disrespecting *their* choices. Because again, it's not about who's lifestyle is better. All of you deserve to live the lives you want without being constantly criticized.", "NTA\n\nPeople need to keep their mouths shut about other peoples' bodies, eating habits, and the like. \n\nI get something similar from my father, who is of course the least healthy person in our nuclear family. \n\nNothing wrong with firing right back in those circumstances. Two wrongs don't make a right, but they can make a *what the fuck ever.*", "NTA - most parents want for their children what they never had. So it\u2019s unfortunate that they are either delusional to their own health or just don\u2019t care and think you shouldn\u2019t either. Kind of baffling tbh. \n\nThe way they kept poking, it was bound to end in a fight eventually. Sounds like you\u2019d never be able to fully sidestep the situation without giving the direct answer that you did. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you aren\u2019t getting the parental support but congratulations to you for your hard work and effort into prioritizing your health.", "NTA I disagree with the E-S-H voters. They raised the issue, they started teasing then escalated to how they don't know you (in these cases it's always because they know they don't have the willpower to do what you do so they get mad and lash out at the nearest target, you) and you just ended it.", "NTA - They don't want to get in shape (their choice) but to try to shame you for it? No.", "NTA. Your parents are in denial they set you up with unhealthy habits. It might make sense to write them a letter or email explaining your new lifestyle and if they want to continue having visits and contact they'll respect your new lifestyle of agree to disagree and stop speaking to them. I can't imagine a 300lbs man thinks he's healthy or in shape.", "NTA. you aren't telling/asking them to change their lifestyle at all but you are investing in your health & frankly, they can't handle that.  You are not the AH but they certainly are.", "NTA. Our parents are our window into good and bad habits we will form as adults. It is an opportunity to glimpse into the future without a time machine. Sometimes they have good habits worth emulating, other times there are habits that we don't want to copy. This goes for everything from how you treat and raise your children to how you treat yourself.", "NTA. Your parents opened the door to this conversation by making snide comments about your eating and workout habits. All you did was be honest with them when they inquired.", "I can't figure out how to edit the post so here we are. First of all thank you to everyone who commented/offered feedback. I appreciate it. Some serious self-reflection going on and some new things to talk about with my therapist so I appreciate the outside perspective. I'm trying to grow as a person and never really realized what an opportunity my communication presents. I do want to clarify a couple of things that came up repeatedly in the comments, not that I expect it to change anyone's perspectives.\n\nI didn't say it in a harsh way or accusatory or judgmental or anything like that. I said it in as neutral/even a tone as someone saying they're going to the dog park because they want to let their dog run around and play with other dogs would say that. If I had said it in any kind of unkind way, I 100% agree I would be TA, wouldn't have wasted anyone's time with that. But I sincerely didn't. I do know thought that words alone carry weight regardless of tone so I appreciate people pointing that out. \n\nA few people said they're just jealous/salty/whatever word you want to go with. That's probably true, but I do also think it goes deeper than that. They're very controlling people and like to have everything exactly to their narrative. So the fact that I'm not willing to be the same person they want me to be is also pretty annoying to them, to put it mildly. This is far from the only thing about me they take issue with, this was just the breaking point it seems.\n\nOverall with reflection I agree, it was a shitty thing to say. I think it was partly motivated by my sincere hope they wake up one day and realize they're killing themselves because I want them to be able to live the life they want. Do I think it's likely? No of course not, I've watched them do this to themselves my whole life. But I can't not hope, you know? Obviously that doesn't excuse it. But I hope it at least explains it a little more than the character limit allowed.", "NTA -  sounds like your parents didn\u2019t like being told the truth .\n\nFor them to make fun of you and berate you for not eating as much as them stinks of jealousy. \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the daughter we raised. How dare you not want to be obese like us.\u201d \n\nNTA", "NTA at all and good for you on breaking that awful cycle. Hopefully your parents learn that they can't comment on you without getting hit back.", "NTA. If you had said it out of the blue, you would be TAH, but they backed you into a corner with their haranguing and teasing.", "NTA\n\n \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding eight years old: They started it. If they criticise your lifestyle, you get to criticise theirs.", "Something to check into, there's a chance that some obesity is due to antibiotics killing off the probiotics your digestive system needs to tell you that you're full. This leads to overeating and several other health problems.", "ESH \n\nYou need to understand something here - you aren\u2019t wrong, but you were an asshole, because will never \u201cwin\u201d this because your lifestyle is a DIRECT INDICTMENT OF THEIR LIFESTYLE AND THEIR PARENTING.\n\nYou living healthy and taking care of yourself makes them feel badly about themselves. It has nothing to do with you. \n\nNow, if you\u2019re like a cross fit paleo guy who won\u2019t stop talking about his latest ultra marathon, I can perhaps see their point, but if you\u2019re just trying to be healthy and active, just stop bringing it up with them. Grey rock them. Say you don\u2019t want to discuss it anymore. You\u2019re going to do your thing and then you\u2019re happy to talk about anything else. If they can\u2019t get a rise out of you, it won\u2019t be interesting for them to pick at. You also don\u2019t need to antagonize them (which is literally just trauma at how you were raised manifesting as like resentment now - you\u2019re angry bc you recognize they had choices and made poor ones, that impacted you and your life.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Most people like to bring fitness enthusiasts down because it's easier than rising up themselves, and it's usually stemming from jealousy that you're taking the initiative they don't have the discipline or motivation to take themselves. \n\nLastly, I learned to just take the high road in those conversations, and just simply say \"so don't work out or use supplements then if you think it's a waste of time and money\". Your comment may have come off as rude, but what do people expect?", "ESH", "The fatties never get it.. NTA", "NTA they were being extremely rude and then took offence to the truth. This is on them.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "It's okay to have a healthy lifestyle but you didn't have to be so rude and mean. ESH", "NTA. They harassed you continually until you finally gave them a much-needed dose of truth. You didn't call them any names or put them down. I find it hilarious that some people keep pressing a button but are outraged when it lights up.", "Nope. NTA. You responded well. Just because they don't care about their health doesn't mean you have to follow their footsteps. Let them sit in their anger. People don't always have to be so appropriate all the time. Maybe this will be a good wakeup call for them", "Nope. They started it and she ended it with facts. Nta.", "Disagree because her parents were hounding her for trying to be healthy.  When someone is that rude to you, you aren't an AH for returning in kind", ">Was what you said also rude? Also yes.\n\nThis is not the right question. The right question is\n\nWas the response appropriate/commensurate to their behavior? Yes.\n\nYou can be rude and it being the appropriate response in the moment. They basically asked for it.", "This is what I always say.  If they're rude, and you're rude right back, well, they weren't in the wrong to be rude in the first place, because you just normalized being rude as an acceptable conversational tactic.\n\nThere's a way to get your point across without being rude, or it's time to stop talking to that rude person.", "It seems like she tried to be nice about it but they kept pushing and making fun of her healthy choices. She might still be the asshole, but it sounds like her parents weren't really going to stop unless she agreed with them, or said something like this. She didn't say anything untrue, and if their health problems are really that bad, they have absolutely no right to be angry that she doesn't want to end up like that. Her parents are absolutely the assholes here, and if OP is the asshole at all its a very soft one because I cant really see any other way this situation would have resolved.", "\"You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole\"", "I get the impression that was inferred and not said, and mom and dad knew it but wouldn\u2019t stop.  They FAFOd and have now thrown themselves in the floor to play fat-shamed victims.", "Nah, ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you said they likely know their habits got them to where they are. The daughter just rubbed it in their face. Absolutely no reason for that other than being an asshole", "Honestly OP I don\u2019t believe you set out to offend them in any way. They started badgering you and nitpicking your choices where you felt that you had to stand up for yourself. The E S H votes are missing the key point that you literally were minding your business and then stood up for yourself. That\u2019s the takeaway I got and maybe that\u2019s because I have a problematic brother who uses \u201cjokes\u201d to criticize my choices then gets \u201coffended\u201d when I stand up for myself and uses the good ole \u201cI was only jk\u201d defense.\n\nYou\u2019re good, I think. NTA.", "Excellent response.  Good on you for working on stuff, love to see people self-reflect.  \n\nI do feel your pain about what a minefield it can be talking to your parents as an adult.  They know exactly how to push your buttons and bring out the worst in you.  It can be hard to communicate that you are trying to grow from your upbringing and build on what they taught you, without making it personal.   I hope this will be an opportunity to open up some better communication with your folks.", "Right, NTA.\n\nNot only did they try to drag OP (back) down to their level, they had *multiple* opportunities to stop needling her about her impressive change in her lifestyle. Now they're upset because they FAFO'ed.", "Exactly. OP didn\u2019t set right out to nitpick their own lifestyle. She explained the why when HER DAD kept badgering her and making little remarks AT HER expense. \n\nNTA.", "'Taking the high road' is code for \"be a doormat.\"", "Or just eating fried and sugar crap all the time.", "Disagree.  I can expect folks to be civil, especially my parents.", "Why was it disrespectful to push back on people who are harassing her for her food choices? Society would say it\u2019s rude for a skinny person to give an overweight person a hard time about how much they are eating. But it\u2019s acceptable for obese people to give a skinny person a hard time for not eating more? No, neither is OK. The parents don\u2019t get a free pass to commenting on OP or anyone\u2019s food choices just because it makes them feel insecure that they are overeating.", "Why should her parents be allowed to disrespect and mock her, and she has to be \"respectful\" to them? \n\nThat's super fucked up.", "lol why do parents always deserve respect?", "So it's ok for the parents to laugh at their kid and son in law. And make jokes at their expense throughout the entire dinner. And keep going on and on and on about OPs decisions to live a healthier life.  But as soon as she defends herself SHE is the disrespectful one?\n\nYeah no.  Parents are 100% in the wrong, and the ones being disrespectful.", "She is not the asshole for disrespecting her parents, they disrespected her first.", "This is where I end up. OP tried to be polite and her parents kept pushing and pushing.", "No. The parents were being inappropriate and OP had enough. She ignored them laughing at her (you know, *making fun of her*). She rebuffed their original shock that she didn\u2019t pig out. But they doubled down, insulting her choice to eat better portions and be active because, gasp, that\u2019s not how they raised her!  Right, they raised her to be unhealthy and treat her body poorly. And thanks to all our overly PC \u201cbody positivity\u201d (which, funny, only seems to apply to overweight people..), medically abusing your child by over feeding them is acceptable but putting up boundaries to not allow someone to harass you for making different choices is wrong. Her parents weren\u2019t going to stop. They were going to keep making snide comments about OPs weight and eating every chance they got if she didn\u2019t get real blunt with them and tell them with no uncertainty that them abusing their bodies does not have to translate to her abusing hers. They may have raised her with no clue how to be healthy but despite their sabotage, she is making better choices and they are going to have to keep their insecure bullying to themselves. \n\nNTA OP.", ">Parents obviously feel insecure and were taking it out on OP for making healthy choices.\n\nExactly this.\n\nI totally applaud OPs commitment to their health, even if it's clear she's still learning (ex. if she got a higher risk and doesn't want a heart attack she should probably skip the pre-workout), but I think she was naive about how it could change things with her parents.\n\nIt's a tale as old as time that when one person changes their lifestyle to focus on their health it can be perceived as judgement by the people around them - that doesn't make it ok to behave the way OPs parents did, but it makes OPs comment an especially low-blow, she just confirmed that she *is* judging them.\n\nNo one (except OPs bf) behaved well here.", "They're trying to shame her for choosing her health. That's horrid behavior, especially from parents who should want their kids to be healthy.", "No, it isn\u2019t.  It\u2019s called not being an asshole.", "While I disagree with the person who commented here, I don't agree that taking the high road means you're a doormat at all. I have taken the high road in these scenarios with people before and just simply said \"if you don't think working out is worth it, then don't do it\" and walked away. they feel silly and you walk away knowing you're on the right track for you. In OP's case, there was nothing wrong with what they did and I probably would have done the same thing, but taking the high road isn't always a bad option and doesn't make you a doormat.", "This sums up my feelings exactly. OP's parents seem to expect there adult daughter to make the same food choices she did as a kid. It comes off as they're unwilling to accept that she's grown as a person and has experienced things outside of the limits of her childhood and decided that some of the things OP did when she was younger no longer suit her as adult", "The parents AREN'T getting a free pass the first commenter said the parents were rude, but also the comeback was rude.  EVERYONE was an AH in this situation.   it's not AM I RIGHT, it's was my behavior rude and therefore am I an AH?", "It's an antiquated system that will eventually die out with the boomers. They're the only ones that seem to think parents are automatically owed respect. Young people know far more these days and since it's easier to discern what is normal and what isn't, this belief system has come into further question.\n\nOP does not owe their parents anything. The fact that this comment about \"disrespecting parents\" is upvoted at all is frankly pretty ludicrous. Being a parent isnt a carte blanche pass to be rude to your children.\n\nAt the same time, OP was rude as well. It doesn't matter if it's her parents or some other people on the other end of this interaction. What she said is objectively rude and unneeded. She could've put up with it and then dipped right after without issue, but instead clapped back and created problems.\n\nESH", "I never said her parents are allowed to be disrespectful. I'm saying there are non-AH ways to respond to disrespect especially if it's people you love (yes, not everybody has to love their parents but I'm going to assume OP loves their parents, idgaf if that makes me a boomer).", "They don't. Older than you doesn't mean I can speak to you however I want the I get to be offended when you clap back.", "Yeah and there\u2019s really only so much that you can take of that. I know I can handle a few comments, but if it\u2019s my parents and they continue to comment, I will 100% say something rude.", "Oh yeah I'm 100% ESH here because commenting on other people's diets or exercise or whatever like this is rude af, in both directions (whether teasing them for being \"healthy\" or mocking their \"unhealthy\" lifestyle). \n\nIt was just the comment about \"disrespect\" and especially having so many upvotes that rubbed me the wrong way.", "As a boomer myself, I take offense to your antiquated opinion of boomers."]}
