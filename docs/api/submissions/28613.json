You also have the right to keep your yard private.

It\u2019s not ok to let a 2 year old wander around unaccompanied.", "NTA. There\u2019s a reason management decided this was important enough to talk about. A TWO YEAR SHOULD NEVER BE OUT WITHOUT SUPERVISION. They could have gotten hurt, or kidnapped, or have gotten lost, or any number of awful things.", "It doesn\u2019t matter what the kid wants. Two years old is too young to be allowed to wander off like that. The kid isn\u2019t even verbal yet. The kid couldn\u2019t even tell you where he lived. \n\nIt would be absurdly easy for the kid to just wander off, possibly into traffic or other dangers.

But how would you feel if the baby was hurt while you were gone, or snatched from your yard. Nothing the mom did was okay. It's not safe and it's not something you want to be involved in.", "Info: is it your yard or a shared yard for the complex?", "You are not the AH. I understand that the child just wanted to play however it is the job of the parent to realize it is inappropriate to go into someone else property without permission. I am just so shocked the parents of this child let them go into a strangers place. I think you did the right thing of reporting, it won't happen again I bet. Also if the kid got hurt on your property you could get sued so your just looking out for yourself and your family.", "NTA - parent was neglectful in not watching their child.

The parents are awfully cavalier about a 2-year old wandering around unsupervised.  And you're 100% correct about the liability.\n\nZero AH behavior here from you.", "You have what is called an attractive nuisance.  You have to expect that children in an apartment complex are going to want to come and play on the playground you built.  You probably need to either find a way to lock it up better or just remove it.  Otherwise you are opening up the apartment complex and/or yourself to a liability risk.  I guess I will go with ESH since this is a known legal issue and you do have some responsibility in preventing the risk.", "NTA, they should have asked first.", "NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s your yard. You should call child protective services the next time the child is left alone to wander to your yard. It\u2019s neglect, and they have no right to expect you to worry about their kid.", "NTA in the slightest. If it were me, I'd have gone a step further and reported the family to CPS. That kid is going to end up hurt or abducted because his parents are neglecting and endangering him.", "You need to put up a camera, and report every instance of trespassing by the child to the police, the complex, and CPS.  This happened October 4th.  \n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12611055/Marcus-Hall-Ohio-death-pool-mom-police-investigation-charges.html\n\nNTA", "NTA. If the child gets hurt, the parents will be coming to you. That\u2019s the world we live in today.", "Yup. Came here to say this.", "That was my thought too, OP might want to mention this to CPS - if the parents think it\u2019s okay to let a 2 year old walk so far away unattended who knows what else the child is doing or where else they might be going.", "It's actually my yard. The child walked across 4 other people's patios and yards to get to mine.", "Lol... of course the parents of a 2 year old don't need to be present or responsible in this scenario... genius take.", "OP doesn\u2019t t have to take responsibility for neglected children. A couple of phone calls can nip that nonsense the bud.", "When the child showed up, so many questions ran through my mind about that. But I didn't want to cause any problems. Cause the mom seemed to be a struggling single mom. But I was concerned about the child walking down that far unsupervised. And playing unsupervised. And to find out it's not the first time, really bothered me, because like I said what if he would've gotten hurt while using our stuff when I was at work?", "Parents need to be parenting - NTA", "Definitely NTA", "If it's not fenced in it could be an attractive nuisance and expose you to liability.", "The parents are responsible, but having an attractive nuisance also opens up the owner to liability. \n\nIt is precisely why in the USA all swimming pools have to be secured behind a fence. \n\nThe laws of the state where you live will dictate the height and any other requirements for the fence for a pool. \n\nIf the OP wants their own playground equipment, they should fence it.", "Insult me all you want, but an \"attractive nuisance\" is a legal issue.  Clearly children *shouldn't* be unsupervised, but if you **know** that their parents aren't watching them closely enough, and you know that you have a super attractive item on your property that a child, due to their age, can't resist playing on, then the law may absolutely consider you to also be negligent in not locking up the playground equipment better.  The child was able to get to the equipment due to the fact that OP **doesn't** have a fence around her yard, and that means other children might do the same. Legally that could get OP in trouble, and since again, this is a known issue that many people have dealt with, OP does have a duty to consider this.  If that child gets hurt because OP knowingly turned a blind eye to this problem, then yes, I and the law think OP might very well have some blame in it.", "A single call to CPS is unlikely to get the child taken away. I work in education and am a mandated reporter so I have some experience in this. Reporting this would put it on the radar of social services which can give mom access to social programs and more resources to better help care for their child.\nIt\u2019s possible mom doesn\u2019t realize how dangerous this could be and it might be a wake up call.", "Interesting legal take, I never thought of it that way. It makes sense but I still think parents need to supervise their children. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard  for a 2 year old going though development but I think kids need to be taught  boundaries and not everything is for them or that they get what ever they want.", "OP brought the child back to its negligent parents and raised the matter. Case closed.\n\nI understand what you're getting at - I was more going after your representation of the issue tbh.\n\nNo hard feelings from me.", "I agree 100%. \n\nThe parents are not parenting their 2yo and if their kid gets hurt, it should also be 100% on the parents for being negligent.\n\nBut insurance companies (and police) have never been known to use common sense when it comes to claims. \n\nReporting the parents was the right thing to do.  But the OP should seriously consider fencing their yard as well.", "I get what you are saying, and absolutely the negligent parent and the apartment complex needed to be notified, that is not why I voted E. S. H.  I voted the way I did because OP shouldn't stop there, she needs to consider what other steps she can take to mitigate the risk she has created, which as someone else pointed out, would mean putting up a fence.", "One thought I had is if it\u2019s an open complex, how would building it not against the rules for situations like this exactly and to avoid liability.", "Incidentally, I'm in the UK and the concept of where the responsibility lies in that law system/scenario is purely comical from my perspective.", "So as far as fencing goes, as a tenant, we can't put up \"permanent structures/fences\". The only thing we can do (which I've already done) is put baby gates around the yard. And the child was able to keep wiggling the gate till it opened. I'm getting a new one", "Before building it, there used to be a fence that separated the yards. For some reason the complex took them down to rebuild and just never rebuilt.", "Americans don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their children. They\u2019re too entitled.", "Well that\u2019s shitty on their part and makes more sense that you built it while the fences were up. These rental places are using COVID as an out to save money. \n\nBefore I got married and moved into my husbands house, I had an apartment for 6 years and we always had pest control. Every three months, a pest company would come in and spray but during COVID they claimed residents didn\u2019t want people in their house even though it literally took 5 minutes and they were out. The years after they stopped it all together and now everyone\u2019s having bug problems from what I hear."]}
