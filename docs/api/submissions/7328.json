I think it's pretty clear they f****d around and found out.", "NTA. Her opportunity to negotiate any part of the established contract was before/when she was moving in, not once she moved in after agreeing to them. You and A agreed to her moving in on the assumption she\u2019d follow the contract. If she wanted to disagree with it or propose changes, she should\u2019ve given you and A the opportunity to weight in or say no before she moved in", "Dear gf,\n The fact of the matter is you are not on the lease and we can evict you at anytime. If you do not like the agreement we have, you are free to leave ANYTIME. Perhaps you should stop being entitled, and start being grateful for the fact that we are ALLOWING you to live here.\n\nSigned,\nThe actual leaseholders.", "NTA. The fact the gf only started having problems with your job once you were pushing back on her complaints is weird here. The new person should be trying to fit in, not making waves.", "NTA, let them take their medicine. You compromise is more than fair I would have suggested she leave if she was unhappy with the preexisting arrangement. For this is not the final chapter of her causing drama.", "NTA", "NTA - you could go back to the original agreement and just keep it simple and reinforced. There are no changes unless somebody wants to move out.", "NTA.   Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  She wanted to take over and want even part of the original agreement, then tried to force changes without talking it over with everyone else.  And then he started AGREEING to it.  Nope.  Consequences.", "NTA. Everything was running smoothly until she showed up and started trying to change everything and complaining about everything. Stupid games, stupid prizes. Of course when their agreement becomes shittier they try to backtrack. Sucks to be them I guess.", "NTA - you had an agreement. They want to break the agreement? They need to renegotiate it. Sound like they were trying to push their luck, good on you for not giving them an inch cos God knows they would have taken the mile.", "Nope, definitely NTA. B was good with all of it before his GF came in complaining. They want to complain, the two of them can do their shopping and whatnot. Sucks to be them!", "NTA. Can I say Gf probably judges you harshly for the work you do and so may be more aggressive towards you? Or expects you to be more passive and a victim?\n\nIt sounds as if this was a great situation that she broke up.", "NTA. You've been very fair and clear with them. They've got to learn their lesson... Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA. Your lease is for that room specifically, its not something she can arbitrarily change, just like I cannot tell my neighbour that we should switch houses because I like theirs better. She also doesn\u2019t get to come in and make changes to an agreement that pre-existed her and that she agreed to as a condition of her moving in. Sounds to me like she tried to throw her weight around and it backfired on her, thats entirely a her problem not your problem.", "NTA", "NTA.  Maybe they shouldn\u2019t agree to things they have no intention of abiding by.  Like what was the alternative?  You and A just take care of everything?  Also, it\u2019s YOUR bathroom.  If GF doesn\u2019t like it then she can leave.", "NTA.\n\nIt's entirely up to you and A to decide if you want to let B back into the old contract or not.\n\nB's GF sounds like a toxic drama llama who wants everything her way. IMO you're better off leaving her out of the agreement. B is collateral damage. He earned his consequences first by not stopping her and then by agreeing with her.\n\nThe one wrinkle I see is that you were exempt from cleaning common areas as a result of shopping and cooking. If you aren't shopping or cleaning for B and GF, it seems like you should pick up a share of common area duties.", "NTA\n\nNTA\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

BTW that includes breakfast, packed lunches and dinner.", "Both my jobs are absolutely legal, and I keep them strictly to my private room (for OF) and the club.\n\nAnd even though I whole heartedly believe that a person should be able to wear what they want, I am in a hoodie and jeans almost 24/7 when not working, so I don't even see how my job impacts them.", "Some people are just prudes and don\u2019t want to think that people can do things that they think is immoral and when they see that person is having fun/having no problems with it, they don\u2019t know how to react. They would have some right/ability to reasonably complain if you were doing your OF content in the public/shared areas, but since you do this in the privacy of your own space, they have no legs to stand on. Roommate B and his GF wanted some more rights/privileges than they had already agreed to, due to their greed and they got burned. I mean, who the heck is complaining about someone else buying their groceries for them AND cooking, and all they have to do is reimburse you for the food and do some easy cleaning of the common areas?

Your job is nobodies business. I actually like your roommate agreement. Well thought out and makes any desputes easy to settle. The GF is clearly a spunge and has no say anyway.\n\nI like how you handled the situation. One concern though. If they don't get back into the agreement. Won't they just spite you and make a mess of the common areas?", "NTA.\n\nI would happily clean common areas in exchange for someone doing meal planning/prep and cooking.\n\nB and his GF had **no** idea how sweet of an agreement they were in.\n\nI think you\u2019re fine not letting them back into the agreement.\n\nIf you **do** let them back in, I think they need to make some concessions.

They should move out to their own apartment together.\n\nThey knew what the agreement originally was, this was just run of the mill bullying from his girlfriend. \n\nYou have no obligation to return to the old agreement because they are unhappy with the outcome.", "OP would have to be hot to be a stripper, she lived with GFs boyfriend before GF did, and OP has the money she makes off of her looks and charm. GF feels powerless and is intimidated by OP, so she figured that if she started dictating the household's dynamic her BF would force OP to give GF the concessions she wants. Funny thing about ladies who work in the industry, they are generally not pushovers. GF fucked around and is now finding that out.", "Lol, you're such a boss. Way to look out for yourself, and you're letting the sneaky b stay. Totally NTA...", "You are a rock star.", "No wonder they're regretting gf's whining, that's a great deal! \n\nThat nice, shiny spine of yours is an excellent way to nip roommate problems in the bud. She obviously wanted to change the arrangement to suit herself, and you said elsewhere she also wanted to make you uncomfortable - SO nice to see that she loses on both counts. \n\nMy money's on them breaking up soon and B coming crawling back begging to be on the plan again. Since he spinelessly went along with her this time, though, there's no guarantee that he's not gonna pull the exact same shit next time he's got a gf, so if you do let him back in, put some extra clauses in there in lieu of a backbone!", "Oh of course, please don't feel I was suggesting anything other than that!\n\nMy comments were very much a generalised statement applicable to any scenario rather than specifically commenting on yours. Your job is certainly none of their business, both B and GF can get in the fucking sea.", "NTA. If GF doesn't like it, she can move out.", "NTA.

The GF knew everything before moving in. She knew which room she would get, the bathroom, the way the bills were split, what everyone does for a living...

I would kill for a roommate that did my shopping and cooking in exchange for some cleaning. I didn\u2019t even know this was an available option!", "NTA. Also, you\u2019re awesome.

What!?! All she had to do was work with two other people to keep the common areas clean? What?!? I can't even imagine a better deal.\n\nYou are so NTA. \n\nI guess since you aren't cooking or shopping for her, she no longer needs to clean. So, be prepared for the place to start being messy.

You could probably treat your space as a stockade.\n\nShe really didn\u2019t think things through.", "Thats pretty cheeky to come in and start demanding changes for an arrangement that has worked for four years.", "Apathy is an amazing weapon. So many people just cant seem to grasp how to *truly* not care about what other folks think, or say, sadly.", "I had a very good friend say about 10 years ago \"if I wouldn't take advice from them why would I give a fuck about their insults\". It stuck.", "100% as long as OP is not forcing uncomfortable situations on them (eg being butt naked in the living room), it's 100% no one's business but her own how she makes money and how she utilizes her private space (bedroom). I'd love to have the body and confidence for such jobs !!! I think the gf is just envious."]}
