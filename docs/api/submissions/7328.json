Of course when their agreement becomes shittier they try to backtrack. Sucks to be them I guess.", "NTA - you had an agreement. They want to break the agreement? They need to renegotiate it. Sound like they were trying to push their luck, good on you for not giving them an inch cos God knows they would have taken the mile.", "Nope, definitely NTA. B was good with all of it before his GF came in complaining. They want to complain, the two of them can do their shopping and whatnot. Sucks to be them!", "NTA. Can I say Gf probably judges you harshly for the work you do and so may be more aggressive towards you?

IMO you're better off leaving her out of the agreement. B is collateral damage. He earned his consequences first by not stopping her and then by agreeing with her.\n\nThe one wrinkle I see is that you were exempt from cleaning common areas as a result of shopping and cooking.

Also OP has no obligation to let anyone use her bathroom that is included in her lease. Finally a fourth of HBO max is like 3 dollars.

I'll clean the whole place by myself if it meant no cooking.", "I doubt that would happen. Separate leases mean they are all responsible for their own part of the rent.

It's hella weird for two grown ass men to live in a house with an OF stripper as it is.\n\nI'm saying she should have been more compassionate towards the only other woman in the house.

I\u2019d also go further to be kicking her back out and him too if he has a problem with it or not renewing their lease when it ends. You don\u2019t need that judgment and hassle in your own home. You lived there without housemates so you don\u2019t need them. You can find another person and next time I wouldn\u2019t allow partners to move in only visit to avoid this when they get comfortable and want to impose their opinions you didn\u2019t ask for or want to hear on you.

Ok.", "NTA good for you now they can cry in the bed they made", "OP you are the roommate of my fucking dreams lmfao.

They obviously never heard the phrase \"don't bite the hand that feeds you\". I love how this has worked out for you. Don't let them go back on the new deal. This is what they asked for and you gave it to them. It's not your problem that they didn't read the fine print and understand how they were fucking themselves over.", "NTA.

You are very generous and your roommate and his gf are idiots.", "\"your\" lol", "The reason it \"impacts\" them is because of their insecurities. We are taught that sex is bad. Being sexual is bad. Also taught to be ashamed of doing anything to make money with flaunting your body is bad. I see you as someone who built herself to be a confident woman and know your own worth. People say ignore what others say and don't take it personally. It is hard to completely ignore it. Surround yourself with people who see your beauty inside and out.

And me and konouchii will split cleaning.", ">I'm judgemental because it is weird and creepy. \n\nNo it isn't, grow up. You don't have enough information to call it weird and creepy, you know nothing about OP's situation besides what she has decided to tell us. This set-up has worked fine for nearly 5 years, do you seriously think that if OP spotted anything creepy she would have stayed in this living situation?\n\nIf anything is weird, it's your inability to accept that men and women can live together as friends perfectly happily. Yes, even when one of them posts on an OF account.", "I think that from outside perspective, it's a weird situation. Not only to OP, but OP herself, too.

But since she complained about everything, nope", "Hello, fellow heaux! Yeah, in my experience strippers are more likely to be hot and heauxs don't need to be as how because they are getting to do more than just look. Regardless, OP is still making cash off of her looks and charm and I think that really upsets the GF.", "Good for you. I tell people that no one can insult me.
