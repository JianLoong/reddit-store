We were both very close with her, me especially. My family in law haven't been very accepting of me, and she was the only one who really took the care to know me better. We had similar tastes in fashion, jewellery and makeup, and we really bonded discussing different products. \n\nNaturally, my husband and I were both very upset when we heard the news, however I think her funeral helped us both get the closure we needed. Now, here comes the part where I think I might have been the ah. \n\nIn his grandmothers will, she gave him all her jewellery and me nothing. We were both quite surprised by this, as what would he have to do with jewellery. He said it would probably be because they had fun dressing up in it when he was a kid, but I was a little skeptical of this as what use would he have for it as a fully grown adult? \n\nI told him he should just give it to me as I would probably use it more anyway and if it was his it would just be put somewhere gathering dust. He told me that wasn't what he wanted, and he wanted it for nostalgia purposes. I thought that was ridiculous, and I told him as much. \n\nHe then got very upset with me saying this was the only thing he got in the will and he wanted to keep it for himself. He then said that I was being insensitive and I should just let him have the jewellery. I left it that in the moment, but later I told him I thought he was being selfish and inconsiderate of my needs. He's been cold with me ever since, and I've been doing the same.
