We were both very close with her, me especially. My family in law haven't been very accepting of me, and she was the only one who really took the care to know me better. We had similar tastes in fashion, jewellery and makeup, and we really bonded discussing different products. \n\nNaturally, my husband and I were both very upset when we heard the news, however I think her funeral helped us both get the closure we needed. Now, here comes the part where I think I might have been the ah. \n\nIn his grandmothers will, she gave him all her jewellery and me nothing. We were both quite surprised by this, as what would he have to do with jewellery. He said it would probably be because they had fun dressing up in it when he was a kid, but I was a little skeptical of this as what use would he have for it as a fully grown adult? \n\nI told him he should just give it to me as I would probably use it more anyway and if it was his it would just be put somewhere gathering dust. He told me that wasn't what he wanted, and he wanted it for nostalgia purposes. I thought that was ridiculous, and I told him as much. \n\nHe then got very upset with me saying this was the only thing he got in the will and he wanted to keep it for himself. He then said that I was being insensitive and I should just let him have the jewellery. I left it that in the moment, but later I told him I thought he was being selfish and inconsiderate of my needs. He's been cold with me ever since, and I've been doing the same. I think he should at least apologise to me for being so greedy, as he wouldn't even let me have 1 necklace.\n\nSo, AITA?

It took me a long time to learn, but appealing to rationality/objectivity in interpersonal relationships is doomed to fail.\n\nI'll try to break down why.\n\n\"Rationality\", or logic, is just a method of assessing premises and arriving at conclusions based on those. However rational you are, your premises are the core of your reasoning.\n\nIn this case, I assume your logic goes something like this: Jewelry is meant to be worn, I am the only one who will wear them, therefore I should have them.\n\nYour husband's logic, however, probably goes something like this: Heirlooms are meant to remember/honour the dead, I loved my grandma and want to honour her, therefore I should have them.\n\nNotice how both approaches rely on a very subjective premise about what the jewelry is \"meant\" for? No matter how much you break your logic down, you're gonna have a subjective premise in there.\n\nYou are both rational. You just disagree on the premises. Those can be discussed, of course, but claiming you are \"just being rational\" is being disingenuous. You use it as a shield to imply that he isn't rational, and to avoid challenging the premises underlying your own \"rationality\".\n\nSo, yeah, YTA for not respecting your husband's feelings, his grief, or his own rationality.", "YTA.

Then you may want to consider consulting an ornithologist.\n\nYTA", "YTA\u2014-and since it doesn\u2019t sound like OP sees children in her future she needs to consider Grandma simply left the jewelry to him to function as caretaker of the pieces.   She needs to be prepared that at some point he may decide to gift the items to other, younger family members.

She didn't have a ton of jewellery, but she had a few nice items, and I think she had Grandma's stuff, too.   I have no idea what is going to be done with her rings, etc.\n\nI mean, yes, I would like something as a keepsake, but, honestly, it makes more sense all that goes to my sisters (I'm the only son).  Value is meaningless to me, because I could never sell anything like that, and, honestly, giving to me just means that it goes to my sisters or their kids when I die.\n\nBesides, I got something that really mattered to me the Christmas before.  When I was 3-4, I had an awesome little biker jacket.  Fake leather, but a magnetic buckle!  I loved that jacket so much, and thought it had been given away to cousins long ago.\n\n50 years later, I open a Christmas present - and there it was.  My jacket.

She gave the jewelry to her grandson to choose who he gives it to in the future.  Says volumes.", "Exactly that.", "Oh eww, YTA. And why are you only 'fairly close' to your husband?", "You\u2019ve been fairly close? \n\nThat\u2019s not a normal way to describe a marriage.\n\nIt\u2019s his grandmother, it\u2019s what was left to him and it\u2019s up to him to decide what to do with it, so yes YTA", "YTA, hard-core! \n \nWhy would you expect to be in his grandma's will?

It\u2019s husbands and wives acting like they work on opposite sides of a courtroom, not as a team. If my husband inherited jewelry he\u2019d tell me I was welcome to wear it (he\u2019d probably even want me to, so he could see the pieces he remembered) and I wouldn\u2019t dream of quibbling with him over who they \u201cbelonged\u201d to or demanding ownership.
