We had similar tastes in fashion, jewellery and makeup, and we really bonded discussing different products. \n\nNaturally, my husband and I were both very upset when we heard the news, however I think her funeral helped us both get the closure we needed. Now, here comes the part where I think I might have been the ah. \n\nIn his grandmothers will, she gave him all her jewellery and me nothing. We were both quite surprised by this, as what would he have to do with jewellery. He said it would probably be because they had fun dressing up in it when he was a kid, but I was a little skeptical of this as what use would he have for it as a fully grown adult? \n\nI told him he should just give it to me as I would probably use it more anyway and if it was his it would just be put somewhere gathering dust.

I thought that was ridiculous, and I told him as much. \n\nHe then got very upset with me saying this was the only thing he got in the will and he wanted to keep it for himself. He then said that I was being insensitive and I should just let him have the jewellery. I left it that in the moment, but later I told him I thought he was being selfish and inconsiderate of my needs. He's been cold with me ever since, and I've been doing the same.

I feel  like I know exactly who she is.", "YTA a major one at that. For starts his grandma left him her jewelry and me noting. She's not your grandma she doesn't  need to leave you anything. Also who do you think you are to demand his inheritance. \nIf you were given money or a car from a relative would it be far for your husband to demand you give him it all. Your sound very greedy. Hopefully he locks it in a safe and will it to someone else in his family.", "100% YTA. I was extremely close to my grandfather and was given some of his things. At no time is my husband entitled to those things. They belonged to MY grandfather. Now, after 20 years i have given my husband a few of these items.

His grandmother left them to him because she wanted him to have them. She did not leave them to you because she did not want you to have them.\n\nYou say, \"we were surprised by this.\" I'm betting you use we to mean you. I'm sure your husband was not surprised at all.  He knows your marriage is all but over, and he'll never get them back in the divorce.  Have you already planned your theft?  Or have you already taken them for \"safekeeping\".\n\nYou accuse your husband of being selfish and inconsiderate of your needs. WTF? Your desperate need for stolen jewelry?

And hoping his family,  who sees you for the shallow, vacuous thief you are, can help to open his eyes.  His grandmother didn't like you. She tolerated you because she loved her grandson. She saw you for exactly who you are, as demonstrated in her will.", "YTA\n\nIf you really had such a good relationship with his grandmother, you would accept her last will. But you don't.

HIS grandmother died and you are arguing with him about jewelry??? I don't know what your husband is going to do with the jewelry but it doesn't matter because it's now his. Have you ever thought he might have given you a few pieces if you didn't immediately demand him to give you the jewelry?\n\nAlso, you are so worried about him being inconsiderate to your needs. What about his needs? What about you being considerate of what he's going through? His grief?", "YTA. Couldn't you buy your own? Start your own heirlooms.", "YTA Just when i think i have read it all. This entitled women comes a long and makes everyone go WTF. Lady you are not entitled to anything of his grandmothers. Get a grip and let the man have his memories. Also maybe get some therapy before you blow up your marriage.", "YTA. 100%\n\nI think grandma got your number and gave all of the jewelry to him on purpose, so that he can give it to his second wife (or heirs)!\n\nYou aren't fooling anyone, honey.", "this isn't real. it can't be.", "YTA, for thinking you could take your husband inheritance from him. Because it is his grandma's jewelry. The jewelry is his not yours even if you gotten along with his grandma. When she was alive. That doesn't mean it yours. You don't get to demand it or be entitled to it. She didn't put your name in the will. So it's not your and it will never be your. It is your husband.

If she would have left him cash, it\u2019s HIS. Not yours. All his. When your family member passes and leaves you something it\u2019s all yours, not his. See how this works? Spouses expecting or demanding inheritance of any kind is disgusting. I\u2019d be cold towards you too and reevaluating my feelings for you.

Selfish Op very selfish SMH.", "YTA\n\nThe jewelry was left to your husband. It is his. It is not yours. There is no reason you should have it other than greed and/or jealousy.

I\u2019m baffled.", "YTA and you sound really entitled too. How can you look in the mirror with that selfish attitude   you got there and not be totally disgusted with what you see?  You deserve nothing and your husband definitely deserves a much better wife than you.  If you don't manage to eventually get any common decency, I'm sure Karma will get you in the end. It is what it is.", "YTA - good god let the man grieve. If you would have just kept quiet I\u2019m sure after he had time to  mourn he may have given or let you borrow a piece that was part of the collection.

It is a nice luxury but never a need. It's not yours and the owner said no.", "YTA. He inherited it from his grandma and it's his to do what he wants with it. You're not owed anything.

If he is, then good for him but I don't think it will last with you two. If he isn't then he should give you the jewelry with a caveat that is in writing. If you divorce, it all goes back to him.
