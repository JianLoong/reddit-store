I met her for the first time but I know her to be a popular make-up artist in the city. \n\nSince they knew I was getting married in December, my friend wanted his fianc\u00e9e to do my make up for my wedding. This session would be paid for, and was supposed to be his wedding gift. I'm not sure if he had discussed it with her or not, but they both seemed happy to offer me this. At the time, I loved the idea because I do know that she is great at her job. I wanted her for my reception and wedding but she only had one slot open for December, so I chose to book her for my wedding day.\n\nFast forward to 2 months  before my big day, I asked when I get to do my trial so that my family and I can see how I will look at the wedding. To that, she told me that she can't fit me in for a trial because of scheduling issues but reassured me that she will make look gorgeous. Getting a trial before the wedding is pretty common where I live and was something that anyone in my peers would expect, had they been in my place. I even offered to pay her to do the trial because this was important for me (and my family). \n\nEver since that day, my family has been pressuring me to look for somebody else. Parents play an important role in weddings down here and they went ahead and booked me somebody else. I also understand why they wanted to do so but now  this put me in a tough spot and I hesitated to deny, what was essentially a wedding gift. Not to mention that the backlash could hamper my friendship as his fianc\u00e9e knows about our \"history\" (Even though nothing happened). I've been delaying but I'm going to break it to her today.

N A H for cancelling or for the lack of trial being a dealbreaker, but because of how poorly you handled this.", "YTA \n\n\nShe told you at the beginning that she didn't have any extra slots available. Nowhere during that time did you ask anything about a trial. You wait until two months before to bring up the trial, knowing she doesn't have the availability. \n\n\nYes, trials are very common, but even if 99% of people have trials, it's even more common to DISCUSS that with your make up artist. In fact, often done before booking for good. \n\n\nYou took up a weekend where she could have otherwise gotten a job. And now your friend probably feels obligated to get another gift.\n\n\n\nAlso, realistically, you think you are going to find another make up artist that has time for a trial and availability on your wedding day that's good?", "YTA.

It's not ok to cancel this close to the day, but it was also not entirely up to you it seems.\n\nThis might be a weird suggestion, but is it possible to have her do the bridesmaids in stead and pay her?

No one would do it with a make up artist theyve never met or used previously with no trial. And two months notice will free up their schedule for one day. The \u201cgift\u201d is not sufficient.

I would prefer a trial cause it gives me more money tho. Lol\n\nBut at the end of the day it\u2019s your fault cause you never told her your expectations about a trial.

She\u2019s also not an AH for her limited availability.", "NTA but just ask the friend \"since you can't book the trial run I need for my wedding, would you be open to doing bridal party makeup that day. I understand if you are not open to that, but my mom and MIL are too worries about the lack of trial run and are booking me an artist.

I don\u2019t blame you at all for assuming \u201cone open slot\u201d meant one event slot, not that there would be no trial or consultation beforehand, those are standard as part of wedding packages.

I am not generally sensitive to products or scents, but discovered at my wedding make-up trial that her preferred finishing spray set off my asthma - which is so mild I don\u2019t even have an emergency inhaler prescription. If we\u2019d waited until the wedding day, I would have missed my wedding.\n\nYour friend may have meant well, but he was kind of an asshole offering up his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s services for your wedding without making sure that she\u2019d be able/willing to treat you exactly the same as a paying client, and that she could offer everything you\u2019d want for your wedding makeup.

Ever heard of the saying \"don't look a gift horse in the mouth?\" You not only did that, you also spit in the mouth. Good luck finding another makeup artist and friend. \n\nWedding culture of \"its my special day so everyone becomes my free labor\" is so toxic.", "YTA. This was a gift and you cancelling is like throwing that gift away, very ungrateful.", "Maybe NAH.  The two of you should have had agreement that includes expectations before and after the wedding ceremony and the window of time for cancelations.  For large events I'd usually give my clients one week before I'd charge them 100%.", "NTA. OP is only 23 years old, and under major pressure from parents. If she wants a trial before her make-up, why shouldn't she be allowed to find someone who will do it?\n\nAlso, what's up with other commenters encouraging the MUA to charge a cancellation fee? If it's a gift, then she's not losing any money, and last I checked, you are not required to use a service just because it's gifted to you.\n\n As long as OP doesn't insist on a different gift from the friend, this seems reasonable to me, and if friend's fiancee wants to be salty about it, she can tell everyone how terrible OP is for not using her gift (although other guests may remind her that the bride is not obligated to use the air fryer she didn't ask for either.)", "NTA. They offered this themselves and you can't half ass a gift, especially something like this. Trial thing sounds common from what you've said, they should've planned a trial before gifting you.\n\nGo on with your wedding day and don't think too much on this. Especially if you aren't that close to them. I mean she wasn't going to work that day anyways. She isn't losing or gaining anything.", "YTA for the timing and not setting the expectation from the time of \"booking\" to ensure a trial would be included. I'm going to be honest - if you know she does great work then you really don't need a trial. It seems strange to me that your family is so concerned about it. Looking back at my wedding day/the days leading up to it, one thing I would have skipped is the makeup trial.", "You should have asked her about a trial as soon as you wanted to book. Before you booked. But you waited and delayed until she didn't have spots left then waited and delayed more expecting her to conjure up a slot now you want to cancel because it didn't appear. You took up a booking= costing her a paying gig. I would charge you a substantial cancellation fee. This will impact your friendship with both because you cost them the ability to put someone else in your spot, didn't communicate with them early enough and then cancelled.", "I\u2019m confused how she had only one slot open for either the reception or the wedding, so the bride chose the wedding.  Wouldn\u2019t openings be date and time specific?", "ESH. She\u2019s being idiotic to think you don\u2019t need a trial for something so important. Not only looks wise but also in case of allergies.

What do the two have to do with each other, and how can you possibly have your tailoring done with less than two weeks??", "But OP took the slot of a paying customer only to cancel last second.", "Yes, she is losing money. She\u2019s making herself available on OP\u2019s wedding date and not taking any paying clients during that time slot as a gift to OP. With OP canceling on her at the last minute, she won\u2019t be able to book a paying client for that time slot. That was fine when she was providing a service that OP wanted but now she will be out money for no reason.", "It is literally the expected process where I am. The fact that she can't fit in a trial means she doesn't actually have capacity for the wedding itself. \n\nIt might be different where you live, but in a lot of the world that is part of the whole package. Like taste testing cakes at a bakery, it's expected you get a trial of the flavours before purchasing it for the wedding.", "Pretty unreasonable of the makeup artist to not try to fit in a trial.  She was asked 2 months in advance, and no one I know is letting someone do their wedding makeup without a trial.  Sounds like she didn\u2019t want the gig to me.", "If OP can\u2019t stand up to her parents, she probably has no business getting married. This is one of many times that she\u2019ll have to tell them to butt out. They overstepped by hiring another MUA so OP needs to put them back in their place by saying: \u201cno thanks, I already have one\u201d.", "You keep saying \u201chere\u201d? Are you somewhere specific? Trial runs for hair and make up are common. At least a consultation. This isn\u2019t a special or odd thing.", "For Brides, and talking about good quality MUAs, there is always a trial. ALWAYS.\n\nRegular makeup no, but bridal makeup 100%", "Sometimes we want to rest and have a personal life tbh. Sometimes i say i dont have slots because i need time for myself or personal commitments.", "I guess hindsight is 20/20. I planned my own wedding, but I made sure I had a contract with my vendors and that we were on the same page about important details before committing. That includes making arrangements with my friend who provided a wedding cake as a gift - asking her all the important details and getting written agreement.\n\nPutting off cancelling until 2 weeks before is the reason why I say YTA. Again, I think if she has a great reputation then you don't need to worry about the quality of her work on the wedding day. However, at this point you're either cancelling on her or on the other makeup artist your parents booked so someone is getting let go on short notice either way. So at this point you just have to make a choice and follow through with it, the sooner the better.", "Too bad.  If it's not in the contract for services it's just societal pressure.\n\nTwo weeks is fine.", "I read the whole post.  OP bowed to social pressure from a friend and was getting social pressure from family.  No winning for OP.\n\nThe parents booked her somewhere else, but OP didn't choose the new stylist, parents did.  That's why I said good luck to OP finding her own stylist on short notice.\n\nTwo weeks is an adequate cancellation window.\n\nThe end.", "We never spoke about a trial. We never spoke about anything There was no plan. I went along with it but I didn't realise it was going to end this way. She is pretty popular so I figured she got it all figured out. Had I known she was not going to give me a trial, I would've had more time to think about it. Also I've been going on about the trial from the past few weeks but her schedule is not flexible to fit me in. I thought we could work something out. \nIt's my fault for not thinking this through. But this is my big day and I can't think about the moral high ground and risk something so important.\nAlso, the only reason I'm cancelling is because my parents have already booked another person and their saying goes here as they are the elders.", "So when you\u2019re attending a wedding as a guest, you don\u2019t accept any bookings for that morning? I doubt that you would turn down money because you\u2019re attending someone else\u2019s wedding later that day. Also, you don\u2019t know if she\u2019s not being paid. For all you know, her fianc\u00e9 is going to pay her fee or they made an agreement that he would help her out with someone in exchange for her doing OP\u2019s makeup. It\u2019s really not OP\u2019s business if  she\u2019s being paid or not. What she knows is this woman gave up one of her slots for a paying gig so she can do the makeup for her wedding.", "\"With OP canceling on her at the last minute, she won\u2019t be able to book a paying client for that time slot\" eh, it's the holiday season so there probably are people that will take that spot if they already are so booked up they can't run a trial, still OP is in the wrong for flaking just now.", "She is a guest at OP\u2019s wedding also. Therefore, would be very unlikely to have booked anyone that morning anyway. Also, if she is as well known as suggested, she absolutely could book a client within two weeks - unless the MUA industry is so drastically different where OP is vs the UK where I am.", "And she knew that 2 months before the wedding. Why\u2019d she wait 6 weeks before backing out? Because she\u2019s the AH.", "I'm trying to keep an open mind. Because, I guess people might have cultural differences. Or may not think of weddings the way we do here. I'm in India", "i think she means where she lives it\u2019s pretty standard to have a trial and i agree trial runs are pretty common but many people in the comments are telling her it\u2019s not", "Absolutely NOT true. Wedding I was at the this weekend, bride did not have a trial. Wedding one month ago, bride had NO trial.", "Not since the pandemic. Several make up artists have realized that it\u2019s not necessary and they only offer it as their availability allows. Some even charge the bride for it.", "I didn't have a trial for my wedding makeup in 2003.  I told her what I wanted, and she did it. The artist did a fantastic job; I never looked better in my life.", "Two weeks is you screwed somebody over. Not fine. It's not a family backyard birthday party but someone's livelihood. It's not realistic for her to expect to keep her friend and fiance after this because she was too indecisive and procrastinated having everything either spelled out or cancelling a long time ago. If there's a contract then you can expect to pay $$$ for breaking the contract.", "OP is going use the makeup artist their parents booked.", "She's been telling you for weeks that she doesn't have time for a trial and you thought \"we could work something out\"? What do you think that was? Do you have the power to add more hours to the day? Do you \"call in favors\" to make another bride \"disappear\"?\n\n\nShe did have it all figured out. She told you she'd do your make up on the day. Did you talk about day of schedule?", ">I can't think about the moral high ground\n\nI mean, AITA is basically the \"do i have the moral high ground or not?\" subreddit.

Since when is a wedding is more important than doing the right thing? Your wedding is one day. I assume you want the MUA\u2019s fianc\u00e9 to still be your friend for years to come. How likely do you think that will be if you screw his fianc\u00e9 over? This is a popular MUA, so I assume she\u2019s good at what she does. If she does a good job for her other clients, why don\u2019t you trust her to do a good job for you?", "Yta. If you haven't found someone already good luck on finding someone because this is a busy holiday for makeup and hair artists. Especially someone good and decently priced. If she is popular enough to have a full booking to do it for free you might have shot yourself in the foot because now she can open up for a actual paying client.", "Your wedding is one day and there's going to be an after the wedding where you have to live with the fall out of your decisions for a very long time. If she's the fiance of your friend she and this issue is going to be an issue for a long time after because if you hadn't waited so last minute she could have booked a paying customer so you cost her a lot of money. You should have decided about the trial and booked or not booked based on that months ago.", "This sounds like a \"you\" problem.

You can\u2019t always guarantee how long/ smoothly things will run, and I also don\u2019t like the stress of having to be at my shop when I have prior engagements that entail my own preparation so soon thereafter.", "Also- she wasn\u2019t being paid, remember? They had specifically said it would be free and their wedding gift to OP. Soooo\u2026", "Anyone who wanted a makeup artist for the holidays has probably made those arrangements all ready. It\u2019s very unlikely that even an in demand MUA would be able to fill a slot with only two weeks notice.", "What are you talking about? Plenty of people work on the morning of a wedding they\u2019re planning to attend. My hairdresser and my nail tech do it all the time. Also, most people book their MUAs weeks, even months in advance. Regardless of the MUA\u2019s popularity, anyone who was interested in booking makeup services on OP\u2019s wedding date has probably made other arrangements by now.", "I am in the UK.

Literally no one i know has done a make up trial for their wedding.", "Ok, understood. I\u2019m in the US and the trial for make up would be built in to the contract. It\u2019s a good lesson, not every gift needs to be accepted. My opinion is \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d would\u2019ve been ok from the initial offer.

Indian weddings are grand functions on another level and this sub probably doesn't get why you're worried about the trial. \n\nIn the last 5 years or so, every bride I knew has had a trial done. Most professionals would definitely get a trial done, the desi wedding look is tricky to get right. It's surprising she's being causual about it. You can't rely on this MUA's verbal assurance, especially when she has never worked on you before. In case, she messes up somehow, it'll be difficult to fix and your family would blame you and never let this go. \n\nDefinitely cancel girl and keep \"family pressure\" as the reason.", "Thank you! People don\u2019t realize how much the industry has changed since the pandemic. When I was helping my friend plan her wedding in 2014, every MUA she was interested in using included a trial in their package.

Bridal package is more expensive for exact this reason, it includes a trial consisting of up to two different makeup and hairstyles.\n\nI have two good friends who are too MUAs in their cities, and that continues to be the norm for them and all their peers.

I know a lot of people in  the cosmetology field and none of them do that. They try their best to make as much money as they can that day because their livelihood depends on it.

Maybe her fianc\u00e9\nwas going to pay her or they might have done a quid pro quo where she provided makeup services to OP in exchange for her fianc\u00e9 helping her with something else.
