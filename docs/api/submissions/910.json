Perfectly okay with me since the kids were thrilled to get extra time with dad.\n\n\nI was taking a video of mom and my kids at the wedding and posted it on my insta. Hours later, I get a call from my ex yelling about my camera catching him dancing drunkenly in the background. I said \"so what?!?!\" He told me he's getting engaged to his conservative girlfriend soon and if her or her conservative family saw him in this video then there's gonna be trouble. I thought that was silly. He demanded that I take it down but I declined. He insisted saying he was \"technically\" recordered via my camera and he did not consent. I called him ridiculous and refused to take it down. He's gotten the kids involved now which got me mad and made the argument escalate.\n\n\nMom is saying I should take it down but I feel like he's trying to control my social media activity.

On the other hand it\u2019s one video, would it really be so terrible for you to remove it or make it private.\n\nI think the bigger question and red flag is his reasoning.  I\u2019d take the video down for now but demand a larger conversation around why he\u2019s basically being fake to his \u201cnew\u201d family, what does he mean the fianc\u00e9 and her family are conservative, why would dancing at a wedding be trouble but divorced with kids isn\u2019t?  Or is it a problem, does fianc\u00e9 and her family know his full situation?  And what does conservative mean to their lifestyle, will their be an expectations around how the kids have to act or what they can and can\u2019t do at his house once he\u2019s married?  Thing they aren\u2019t expected to do or believe now.  To me his reason for wanting the video gone raises a lot of questions about future expectations with a step-mom and step-family possibly involved.", "Ask yourself this - is that \"silly\" video worth destroying your co-parenting relationship with him right now?

You get to share your funny moment, he's protected, win-win. \n\n\"Controlling your social media\" doesn't apply when you violate someone's consent. Even for seemingly silly moments.

Both of you need to commit to never put the kids in the middle of your disagreements, particularly ones that have nothing to do with them.", "FWIW, you have no reasonable expectations of privacy in a public setting, so him saying he didn't consent is a moot point.

He's the asshole for not accepting the repercussions of his own behavior, and for bullying OP by getting the kids involved.\n\nOP is NTA because she wasn't posting a vid of her ex, but one of her kids with their grandma. It sucks for the ex that he will get called out by his fiancee, but that his completely on him.\n\nThat said, sometimes it doesn't matter who is being the asshole, and we retreat in order to keep the peace. OP needs to evaluate the relationship she has now with the ex, and also how that relationship will change once he gets married.

Whatever you decide, good luck!", "It\u2019s your social media is correct and anything you post that is just you then no big deal.

Kids should never be used as pawns in a parent's argument. Lastly, it sounds like he's hiding a lot from this gf which can't lead to a good future for him. He needs to personally evaluate why this is causing such anxiety for him. \n\nTHAT BEING SAID: It isn't hard to delete a video or re-edit it or blur or remove person's from it. It isn't difficult at all. That feels more like a pride issue for you. If this is the only time he's asked, this can be the only time you oblige. Who cares.

I say NTA. For two reasons. \n\nFirst, he was at a wedding. There was no expectation of privacy. If he didn't want his photo he shouldn't have gone to a wedding where there's going to be photos and videos. \n\nSecond, he is upset there's a drunk video of him on the internet and his conservative maybe future in-laws and GF will see it. Does he realize that they aren't against videos, they're against the behavior. He's literally hiding the parts of him he doesn't like so that they'll stick around; if you like to get drunk, but they don't, then maybe that's just something to not continue, especially if it's such a deal breaker that you believe they'd end a relationship over itm \n\nThird, he can't control what you put up on SM. \n\nTLDR: Don't like videos of you being drunk on the internet? Don't get drunk in a public place or place where privacy is not assumed/expected. Also, don't let your ex tell you what to do over something stupid.\n\nEdit: I realize I said two reasons then listed three; I decided to add the third one cause why not \ud83d\ude09\n\nEdit number 2: Yes, I get it, the ex doesn't want the video up. I don't think it matters. You can't go to events where you know there are going to be videos and photos, act in an embarrassing manner, and then expect everyone to get rid of any media that has you in it. Behave how you want to be perceived, at a minimum. If the situation was different and this was a small get together of friends, and a video was taken and posted in bad taste, then this would be different. I would be against that.

What about their social media? What expectations or changes to how your kids currently live is he going to expect that he has a right to impose on THEM because of his new relationship?\n\nAfter this conversation, you may decide to alter the custody agreement, or you may wind up needing to have a very specific conversation with your kids as coparents explaining what you have both agreed to.", "Yes!!! Take the video down, it's a stupid argument to have. The important conversation is about the kids. How is this woman going to treat your children?!? If this silly video is such a big deal how are your children going to be expected to act around this woman and her family? This would be a serious concern for me.", "I was suspect of his reasoning as well. Dancing at a wedding!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think he told the GF he was somewhere else and not at his ex wifes brothers wedding. I think he is more worried he will be caught for being at the wedding and not dancing at the wedding. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would he call OP and right away get pissed and yelling BEFORE she even answers yes or no to taking the video down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can bet had he asked nicely and not yelled OP would of taken it down. I have had pics etc posted and just asked nicely \"Hey would you mind taking that down?\" And most just say Ok and remove it. I dont start out YELLING like OPs ex did. He acting like she did it on purpose.", "This, completely.  The fact that he's marrying, and thus exposing your kids to, someone who is so conservative that a video of him dancing at a wedding will get him in trouble is VERY concerning to me.

This is the best possible answer. \n\nEven though he was in a more public space, so technically you have the *right* to leave it up, it's basic courtesy to take a video of someone else off your public page if that person asks you to, and I believe you are definitely an AH for not making it private after he asked. There's no reason the video needs to be shared with people outside of those actually involved in it. But it definitely sounds like there needs to be a discussion about how step-mom will be fitting in to your lives and co-parenting dynamic.", "This. If his conservative girlfriend is soon going to be a step parent, you guys need to work out parent rules before the fanatic moves in and starts to brainwash them.

The best thing to do is not get drunk at a place you know people are recording if you have a chance to ruin relationships with people because of it.", "I'm betting he's trying to couch this as they don't think he drinks or something when it's actually \"you told me *she* wasn't going to be there\"", "Furthermore, does this mean that the kids will be raised to adhere to the conservative standards of the step-mother? Because that could be a big problem for me", "Yeah, I wouldn't want my kids around ultra-extreme loons like the ex's fiancee's family sound. That needs to be a priority problem.", "So much this! ESH for the exact same reasons. Taking the video down or making it private is super easy and there's no reason not to just do it for the sake of your co-parenting relationship. I'm sure OP has plenty of videos from the wedding that could go up in its place. The real issue is the fact that he *wants* it taken down, lest his fiance find out he drank and danced.

Is he gonna ask the kids to lie about his behavior at the wedding for him?\n\nIf it really does violate his rights, he can report it, and the site will take it down, but he can't give OP the duty to help him cover up his behavior, and taking on that job is not worth good coparenting. \"Just agree to keep them happy\" is a policy RIPE for abuse.\n\nNTA He didn't have to get drunk and dance. He did it willingly, and now he wants to lie to his fiancee/marry someone he needs to lie to to earn their love.

It seems more like OP wants to keep the video because the main focus is her mom and kids. Plus, I can also understand her feeling immediately defensive if her ex called and yelled at her without even trying to talk like an adult. It\u2019s a video of her children and her ex suddenly yells at her over it. So I can definitely see her reasoning for wanting to keep it.

One of them would affect my children and how they're being raised, the latter just means he's likely to be divorced again lmao", "\"Hey we have a great  co parenting relationship and are just disagreeing about taking a video down\"\n\nAita - Nuke the relationship.", "Surely that\u2019s 90% of any wedding photos?", "Yeah, but that\u2019s her ex\u2019s decision", "Her children are in it enjoying themselves at a wedding. He should suck it up and let the wedding be celebrated and stop causing drama NTA", "And she cant blur him out of the video, why?", "Right? If your future spouse/in-laws will hate you for drinking and acting foolishly you either need to ditch that relationship or quit drinking. It's not OP's job to cover up his mistakes for him. \n\nIf the video was solely him acting like a fool OP might be the AH but not if the focus is clearly other people and he just happens to stumble into the background for part of it. NTA OP.", "At a wedding? Where most people have at minimum a photographer, and possibly a videographer? \n\nVideographer not so much now, because everyone has better cameras in their phones than a decent DSLR; but ffs, if he didn\u2019t want to be caught acting drunk, he shouldn\u2019t have gotten drunk. \n\nWhy wasn\u2019t his soon-to-be fianc\u00e9 with him anyhow? He didn\u2019t get a plus one? Or does he plan to just hide this side of himself from his new gf and her family\u2026", "She doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with him tho", "I'd argue the wedding makes this a bit different - they're highly photographed events, and you don't really have an expectation that you won't appear in videos or photos there.\n\nThe reasonable compromise for me is that OP can keep it up, but lock down who can see it a bit - if it's on Facebook or insta, there's a solid permissions model that OP can use", "Im a private person too but I understand that if i go to a wedding of all things there are going to be cameras *everywhere*. It\u2019s not like she had a video of him being drunk at a bar or a party, it was a wedding. Everybody constantly has their phones out and even most people have professional photographers. In that situation you can\u2019t try and hide your way out of it. If i didn\u2019t want to be in the background of someones video while i was drunk at a wedding, i just wouldn\u2019t get drunk. Simple as that.", "I had a friend at church who used to make out her tithe checks to the Ass. of God. It's been 50 years, and it still cracks me up.", "Dancing leads to kissing and kissing leads to sex. Premarital sex makes Baby Jesus cry. The first wedding in my generation in my community that featured a dance was SO controversial! They\u2019ve mostly lightened up now though.", "Really? Yours must have been more restrictive, I also grew up and was raised in a Pentecostal church and all that but we were allowed to dance, just couldn't wear pants, couldn't wear make-up, dye your hair or cut your hair.", "It was awful. Everything was a sin. Especially being a girl. I have trauma regarding it to this day. I know every religion has offshoots and everyone interprets the Bible differently which is stupid.", "I am so sorry but hey at least we've escaped it right? I'm sorry that you had such a traumatic experience though that's always rough.", "Her actions weren't immoral though... She didn't do anything wrong, he was in the background and threw a hissy fit that him tipsy dancing can be seen by his inlaws. Jeopardizing her stable parenting setup is where she could be the jerk", "I might feel a bit differently if they didn\u2019t currently have a good relationship, which is so beneficial for the kids. If he was constantly making her life difficult I might not blame her. But it really doesn\u2019t cost her much to either take it down or blur/crop/edit him out. \nI also believe that people should have the most agency possible over their own image. He was obviously doing something he didn\u2019t want make public and should have realized there were cameras constantly at work during a wedding. But I don\u2019t think that means he can\u2019t request it be removed. \nI\u2019ve had a number of friends over the years ask me to take down a photo just because they didn\u2019t think it was flattering. It was sometimes annoying but it cost me nothing to edit them out or remove the post.", "It depends on where and definitely not universal.  Many places have privacy protection built into their legal system that limits publication of your likeness.  In these places outside of certain exceptions you have a right to not have your identity exposed without your permission.", "Which is the confusing part here. This isn\u2019t a public thing but it could possibly be in a public place. It\u2019s also unreasonable to assume you have privacy here.\n\nI will say that\u2019s completely beside the point.  If someone asks you to remove it from social media you should remove it to be respectful.", ">  if he's featured in it.\n\n#FEATURED\n\nIn a movie there are the **_featured_** performers, the ones the focus is on, and who are intentionally being filmed, and then there are the extras in the BG. \n\nHere, dad was just an extra.", "> if someone asks you to take down a pic/video of them then you should\n\nIt's not OF him. It's of her mother and kids.\n\nHe's in the background as per OP.\n\nFurthermore, do you defend him yelling at her for posting the video? If not, why YTA instead of ESH?", "It\u2019s not a video of him though he is in the background of the video.", "Yeah but this guy sounds a bit mental for caring that much, or is marrying into a family that sounds detrimental for his children. So yeah I\u2019d probably take it down just for the lack of drama but ultimately there\u2019s something dodgy going on for him just having a drunken dance to be an issue.", "agreed", "Come on.

This is one of those situations where I can't quite decide if ESH or NAH. Like each are leaning just a little too far one way or the other to call it either", "It\u2019s ESH.  Op for not taking it down (putting it up was innocent, but not leaving it up) and ex for lying to his gf about who he is so that this is an issue in the first place.  That\u2019s a real AH move.", "Ex is definitely bigger AH in this case. Marrying conservative that sounds like she\u2019ll upend these kids whole understanding of the world; using kids as a weapon in the argument; hiding his behavior from new gf.", "Seems like an effort, the other alternative is he just gets over it and takes responsibility for the fact he got pissed and danced at a wedding \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "That's fair. I would be open to discussing an E.S.H., but I just believe this isn't a straight her only  being an A.H.", "And if someone asked me to take it down I would.", "That... Sounds very very unfortunate... Do they know that Jesus danced and had wine? Like????", "THIS. Everyone is talking about OP harming the co-parenting relationship but HE started it by calling and screaming at her from the get-go, making demands (NOT requests), and then weaponizing their children. \"Just do it so he doesn't get mad\" is just...terrible advice.", "Exactly. With the technology and filters at our finger tips she could easily blur him out or crop him out or just cover his face.", "Normally people in cults like that do not marry outside their religion, it can be frowned upon to downright not allowed. *speaking from experience in deep evangelical christianity - and yes it is like a cult.", ">Also, it is a major red flag Ex is engaged to someone so conservative that he can't be himself when she's not around.\n\nHe can be himself when she's not around...just not on camera.", "Some might but the church I grew up in was SUPER strict. We were independent and weren't allowed to associate with the official United Pentecost Church because it was considered too liberal (as in, people could watch TV and could wear short-sleeves).\n\nPreachers would use the argument that the vertical dance position was like a horizontal wish or something like that, implying that it was too close to sex. \n\nPentecostal churches are pretty varied too. Some are in the UPC, some believe in the Trinity while some don't, and there are different opinions on speaking in tongues. Then you have the televangelists who will say they're Pentecostal but my former church said were fakes. \n\nThe more years I'm out of the church the crazier it seems, but while I was in the middle of it everything seemed normal.", "Why do people feel like their need to get attention on their posts is more important than protecting the feelings of people they know? If someone you know asks you to take a video of them down, the polite thing to do is take it down. It costs you nothing. It's so weird to me that so many people in here think it's okay to keep an embarrassing video up that someone asked you to take down just because you can.", "Lol great little out-of-context snippet. Shame you got called out for it eh?", "Your example can only occur under specific circumstances. Such as revenge porn or stuff that occurred during a marriage. But in an environment where a third person can see, then it is public. In other words your comment is irrelevant to the original scenario.", "In the US the only way you are going to get in trouble is if you do something with someone else's image for renumeration.

I\u2019m the type of person who always looks at avoiding the unnecessary. Is having a video up on your IG that in reality has no actual value to you (it\u2019s not her wedding) worth the trouble, where as it could be for someone else? I take it down, but then again I\u2019m not so stubborn over such nonsense.", "He's not even asking her to delete the video completely. Just take down the post.", "Okay, no one in this particular comment thread talked about legality. Just saying that weddings are not private events and you should expect to be photographed or be in the background of other peoples videos.", "But HE jeapordized the relationship by calling her and yelling and making demands. Why does \"not jeapordizing the co-parenting relationship\" necessitate that *she* capitulate to him? HE escalated first over an objectively very minor thing.", "There is a lot of discussion of legalities in this thread. Either way it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is very basic etiquette to edit or delete a post from social media if someone in it asks you too. \nI\u2019ve had friends ask me to do the same simply because they didn\u2019t think it was a flattering photo. I can\u2019t imagine denying someone that request.", "But he also came out swinging at OP, literally yelling at her over the phone and \"demanding\" she take it down. I suspect that OP might have been more amenable to compromise if he hadn't already seriously escalated from the get go. How was OP supposed to know this would be a problem? He was just dancing, not like, banging someone. There's a big difference between a polite request and a screaming fit.", "Hmmm, I don't know about that. In the UK at least, there is 1 CCT camera for every 11 people and it's estimated that the average person is caught on camera 70 times a day."]}
