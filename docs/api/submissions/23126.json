Noah and i met when we were sixteen and got engaged when we were about 24 and shortly after we found out that i was pregnant. however, Noah died in a car accident not too long after. this wrecked me and both of our families since we had been together for so long and they had watched us grow up together.\n\nNoah was his mom\u2019s only child and she had him at a young age, so they were very close. the whole family helped raise Noah when he was young and when Noah and i started dating we always had our weekly dinners with just the three of us. his mom and i became really close and even closer after Noah\u2019s death. her and i continued those weekly dinners and included the twins when they came along. \n\nmy current boyfriend of ten months (i\u2019ll call him Rick) has recently told me that he doesn\u2019t like how close i am with Noah\u2018s mom. he doesn\u2019t like our weekly dinners and thinks that only the twins should go, he doesn\u2019t like that i still have pictures of Noah and I in my house (Rick doesn\u2019t live with me and the twins, just spends nights), and doesn\u2019t want me going on vacation with Noah\u2019s mom and her family. \n\ni\u2019ve been going on vacation with Noah\u2019s mom and her family since i was sixteen and i continued to go even after Noah\u2019s death with the twins. it\u2019s never really came across my mind to stop going because i love Noah\u2019s mom and the twins love spending a week at the beach with their grandmother and the rest of the family. \n\ni told him that the pictures stay because he doesn\u2019t live here and the twins love looking at pictures of their dad. then i told him that it\u2019s too late to back out of the vacation and that i enjoy spending time with Noah and his family. he then told me that i\u2019m not apart of Noah\u2019s family so i have no reason to go and that i\u2019ll never be apart of the family because Noah and i never married. i was taken aback by this and told him to get out. \n\ni called my parents and told them what happened and to my surprise, they agreed with him. they believe that i need to start pulling away from Noah\u2019s family because again, i\u2019m not apart of it and i never will be. they said that i don\u2019t need to be rude to them or anything, but i shouldn\u2019t be going on vacations, having dinners with his mom, or going to family gatherings and that i need to start a new chapter of my life, one where Noah and his family aren\u2019t in it because i\u2019m taking \u201ctoo long\u201d to move on from Noah. then Rick texted me saying to contact him when i\u2019m actually ready to be in a relationship with someone who isn\u2019t Noah. \n\ni really don\u2019t know what to make of this. i thought i moved on enough. i know that Noah and i will never be married, i\u2019ve accepted that. i just still see his mom as a mother figure because i\u2019ve known her for so long and the twins love her. she was one of the only people who knew how i felt when Noah died and i don\u2019t know what i would do without her. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690318085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159kk6n/aita_for_not_moving_on_fast_enough_from_my_late/", "score": 716, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You aren't doing anything wrong by staying close with Noah's family.  It sounds like this is a healthy arrangement for most people concerned, especially the kids.  I think anyone coming into your life needs to respect what they are getting themselves into by dating you. \n\nI think Rick and your family are 110% wrong about your not being a part of Noah's family. That's just really crappy thinking.  Family isn't always blood or have a ring attached. \n\nThat said, over time I would hope/expect the relationship with his family to evolve a bit so that  you DO have (emotional) room for a new significant other, and that he and Noah's family could develop a healthy bond. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't think Rick is the right person for you.", "NTA Holy smokes! \n\nYOU ARE A PART OF NOAH\u2019S FAMILY, and they have shown you this through their actions. You will always be family because you are the mother of Noah\u2019s children. Everything that you\u2019re describing is healthy behaviour. You have a support network that extends past your own blood relatives, and this is a good thing. \n\nUnfortunately some people confuse allowing a person\u2019s memory and legacy to live on with not healing. You are healing, you are continuing to do good things for yourself and you have surrounded your children with people who love them. Mariage is only a piece of paper. You and Noah were partners and family, something his side of the family clearly understands and appreciates. \n\nUnfortunately, parents (yours) don\u2019t always give meaningful and insightful support, and that\u2019s okay. They don\u2019t have the tools to handle what you\u2019re living through, but you clearly do. \n\nAs for your boyfriend\u2026he is an immature, insecure, controlling child and you should not waste a single second with him moving forward. You get to grieve and move on at your own pace, and having photos of your deceased partner and the father of children in the home is not only reasonable it is wonderful that you are keeping his memory alive for your kids. \n\nThere is this disgusting and misogynistic view in the world that a widow (what you are despite the lack of mariage certificate), and a single mother are somehow damaged goods. This is grossly misguided, and giving into those tropes will only bring more people into your life who believe that nonsense. \n\nYou don\u2019t need that. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re doing great. Take the boyfriend as a learning experience (you will have others). Don\u2019t introduce your kids to man until you\u2019re sure his values are reflective of your own. Furthermore, don\u2019t let that man dictate how you raise your children in your home. This are issues that must be discussed and clarified in advance. As for your parents, they are what they are, love them for that and ask for advice from people who have a deeper understanding of what you\u2019re going through like a grief counsellor or perhaps a mentor if you can find one.", "NTA - Your kids have a right to have a relationship with their grandmother and you\u2019re doing a wonderful job fostering that.

You were with Noah for nearly 10 years and you had children together. Your families have been closely intertwined most of your life. That\u2019s not something you just \u201cmove on from\u201d, especially considering that Noah\u2019s family *is* your family since they are related to the father of your kids. You and your children need and deserve full access to both sides of their biological families. \n\nA true partner would support you, understand & respect these relationships, and encourage them as they are good for you (and good for your children to see their dad\u2019s family). If Rick cannot do any of those things and is instead doing the opposite, I would use that as a hill to die on. \n\nAs for your own family, shame on them as well. If the roles were reversed (you were gone and Noah was around and maintaining great relationships with them + your kids), how would they feel if Noah\u2019s new GF had him cut them off?  Would they not be upset at losing that relationship with him that they\u2019ve had for 2 decades?", "Your parents are wrong.  She is your family.  She is your childrens grandma and has been a part of your life for over 10 years.  You will never forget Noah and you shouldn't feel like you have to.  You see him everyday in your children.  Love is not finite, you can love someone else while still loving Noah.  If Rick can't understand that, he is not ready to be in a relationship with you.\n\nNTA", "Kudos to you and Noah\u2019s Mom for providing your kids with such a stable and loving connection. Noah\u2019s Mom isn\u2019t just your kids\u2019 grandma, she\u2019s a part of your chosen family. A boyfriend who asks you to close the door on love and support is acting from their own insecurities.", "NTA\n\nNoah is not only your late fianc\u00e9,  he's the father of those twins.  The people Rick wants you to pull away from are not  just your late fianc\u00e9's parents,  they are your children's grandparents. \n\nWhen the kids are a little older,  maybe it *will* be the right move to step back *a little bit* (like not stay for every dinner and maybe let them take the kids on little trips without you) but right now?  You're doing just fine. \n\nI am very sorry for your loss.", "You had children together. That makes you family beyond anything that anyone can dispute. Your children deserve to be a part of their dads family and that will include having a relationship with you as well. \nRick sounds jealous and controlling and it will only get worse. Someone who truly loves you will allow you to grieve and be there for you and your kids without judgment or ultimatums. \nMy late boyfriend passed away 4 years ago. My current boyfriend allows me to cry still and will hold me when I get sad and allow me to talk about it without getting upset. It\u2019s not very often, but it happens. When someone dies suddenly they don\u2019t disappear from our hearts, and you need someone that understands that. For your mental health as well as your children\u2019s. \nNTA", "NTA Wow. You will always be a part of Noah\u2019s family and anyone new in your life needs to accept that. Your children will be connected to them and in extension you will too.

Your boyfriend is jealous of a dead person, wtf? Also, just because you were never married doesn't mean you can't consider his family your family. Family is about more than just genetics and legally binding contracts. Keeping in touch with his family doesn't mean you haven't moved on, but more importantly what even is his definition of moving on? Does he think you should just pretend the relationship never happened and none of it should matter anymore, to the extent that you have to cut off people who were involved? That's a sad way to live life in my opinion.\n\nYour boyfriend is trying to cut you off from people who genuinely love and care about you and have been with you through hard times.

First, there is no timeline for grief. Second, only you get to decide who is your family. Just because you and Noah were never married does not mean that he and his family are not your family.

Maybe that will fade as your kids get older. Maybe you will eventually find a new partner who respects your relationship with Noah's family and is able to join you for those family dinners or trips. Maybe you will remain single forever. None of those options are \"wrong\" or \"inappropriate.\" And guess what - you NEVER have to move on from Noah.

Noah and i met when we were sixteen and got engaged when we were about 24 and shortly after we found out that i was pregnant. however, Noah died in a car accident not too long after. this wrecked me and both of our families since we had been together for so long and they had watched us grow up together.\n\nNoah was his mom\u2019s only child and she had him at a young age, so they were very close. the whole family helped raise Noah when he was young and when Noah and i started dating we always had our weekly dinners with just the three of us. his mom and i became really close and even closer after Noah\u2019s death. her and i continued those weekly dinners and included the twins when they came along. \n\nmy current boyfriend of ten months (i\u2019ll call him Rick) has recently told me that he doesn\u2019t like how close i am with Noah\u2018s mom. he doesn\u2019t like our weekly dinners and thinks that only the twins should go, he doesn\u2019t like that i still have pictures of Noah and I in my house (Rick doesn\u2019t live with me and the twins, just spends nights), and doesn\u2019t want me going on vacation with Noah\u2019s mom and her family. \n\ni\u2019ve been going on vacation with Noah\u2019s mom and her family since i was sixteen and i continued to go even after Noah\u2019s death with the twins. it\u2019s never really came across my mind to stop going because i love Noah\u2019s mom and the twins love spending a week at the beach with their grandmother and the rest of the family. \n\ni told him that the pictures stay because he doesn\u2019t live here and the twins love looking at pictures of their dad. then i told him that it\u2019s too late to back out of the vacation and that i enjoy spending time with Noah and his family. he then told me that i\u2019m not apart of Noah\u2019s family so i have no reason to go and that i\u2019ll never be apart of the family because Noah and i never married. i was taken aback by this and told him to get out. \n\ni called my parents and told them what happened and to my surprise, they agreed with him. they believe that i need to start pulling away from Noah\u2019s family because again, i\u2019m not apart of it and i never will be. they said that i don\u2019t need to be rude to them or anything, but i shouldn\u2019t be going on vacations, having dinners with his mom, or going to family gatherings and that i need to start a new chapter of my life, one where Noah and his family aren\u2019t in it because i\u2019m taking \u201ctoo long\u201d to move on from Noah. then Rick texted me saying to contact him when i\u2019m actually ready to be in a relationship with someone who isn\u2019t Noah. \n\ni really don\u2019t know what to make of this. i thought i moved on enough. i know that Noah and i will never be married, i\u2019ve accepted that. i just still see his mom as a mother figure because i\u2019ve known her for so long and the twins love her. she was one of the only people who knew how i felt when Noah died and i don\u2019t know what i would do without her. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you ever want him to be a father figure to your kids, it would be very hard to compete with an idealized rival. And he might worry that Noah WOULD be idealized and that he'd be compared.

With as close as you are to Noah's family, it really could feel like there were three people in any relationship you have.\n\nBUT....them's the breaks. You really genuinely might have to choose between moving a little bit away from Noah's family and having a successful relationship with Rick or other partners. But you're not an AH if you choose Noah's family. And even if you did marry Rick or he moved in, your kids shouldn't be deprived of pictures of their Dad. You'd have to be careful not to make Noah an obstacle to Rick being able.to be a good father figure, but he'd also have to be secure and mature enough to not try to eliminate memories of your kids' dad from their home.", "NAH: If you feel you want to continue these traditions I completely understand. \n\nAt the same time I see Ricks point of view because if you stay together long term do you plan on bringing him to these family dinners once a week, will he be going on vacation with their family. \n\nThe pictures I agree with you but seemed you told him if you don't like it leave.....so he left", "NTA you are in a tough situation.\n\nWith that said, you are putting a huge burden on any potential future partner by leaving so little room for them.

She just wanted to find a nice man who would love her and her mom and to help.  Needless to say that sales pitch didn't win me or any guy over.\n\nIf you met a nice guy and he wanted you to spend time with his ex's family weekly and to use your limited vacation time to vacation with these inlaws how would that land on you?

Your BF should be embracing Noah to the kids, that\u2019s what I\u2019d want.  Maybe as they get older and you grow more with BF, pictures can minimize but right now it\u2019s still fresh.

Or because you never spent an exorbitant amount of money to feed all your friends and family one time? You\u2019re not married because you didn\u2019t profess your love to each other in front of a bunch of people? We define marriage as this public, contractual thing. And, sure, legally, it is. But spiritually, eternally, truthfully, it sounds like you and Noah WERE married. It sounds like you had the kind of love that is recognized by the Universe or by God, if there is one. And you gestated two of Noah\u2019s blood relatives in your womb. That is related as fuck! That is family! That\u2019s how families are made! Love is how marriage gains it\u2019s integrity! I am very, very fucking sorry that your HUSBAND died. That is so unfair, it hurts to read. Everyone saying you weren\u2019t married or aren\u2019t family are absolutely, inarguably WRONG. They do not get to define marriage and family for you! I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get to have your wedding, mama. I think you\u2019re making great strides in moving forward with your life. I think Rick is not ready to be in a mature relationship with someone who has had to live through hell.

Family is forever.  A boyfriend of 10 months trying to bully a widow? Tell him to take a hike if he is threatened by a person that has passed.  \n\nThis reminds me of the redditor that burned all the possessions of her husband's dead wife.  The husband and the dead wife's children were crushed by the \"disappearance\" of their mementos.  But the new wife was all smugly satisfied.  Once the husband found out the truth, he divorced her. Jealousy of a passed spouse is ridiculous.", "NTA. You are forever connected to Noah\u2019s family because you literally had kids with him. Your kids are a part of Noah\u2019s family so you\u2019re a part of Noah\u2019s family. Even if you never had kids together, you were engaged high-school sweethearts.

I don\u2019t know you obviously, maybe you are ready for a new relationship, but maybe not, it really doesn\u2019t matter. Grief doesn\u2019t move in a straight line. I can undertake your parents wanting the best for you, or being worried but honestly if you have healthy relationships with Noah\u2019s family there\u2019s no harm in maintaining those  bonds and still having room for the right fella at the right time.

It's lovely that you have such a strong relationship with Noah's family, and as your kids grow they're going to so appreciate this link to their dad's family as well. \n\nSometimes grief does prevent people from 'moving on' after a partner dies in an unhealthy way (you want to be in a new relationship but you can't stop thinking about your previous partner, comparing them to your current one, not being able to commit to a new relationship because of the old one, etc.) but that doesn't sound like the case here. You're maintaining a connection for your children with half of their family, you're staying close to people who you've known and loved for over a decade, and you're keeping pictures up of your children's father in the house where they live. \n\nYour parents are not correct. Is it possible that they're jealous of how close you are with Noah's mom? (Not that it justifies their behavior, but it might explain it.)

Any man who says he loves you must also love Noah and his memory too, because it should be a living breathing part of your twins\u2019s lives. They should never have to worry about if missing their bio dad will hurt the feelings of their stepdad. Stepdad should encourage them to find and nourish the bonds they can. A good man will understand that it\u2019s an honor to love and care for another\u2019s kids when their dad is not alive to do it himself.

First, you can grieve as long as you want, no one gets to tell you when to stop.  Second, Noah's family is your family regardless of your marital status with Noah; they want it, you want it.  No one gets to take that away from you (or them) or decide otherwise, except you.  Finally, Rick needs to stop being jealous of your (sorry) former boyfriend.  I think having the photos in the house may be a little upsetting to the new guy, but keeping photos of the kids' dad while the new guy doesnt live there is mostly okay, and spending lots of time with the grandparents is lifelong.

It sounds like Rick is not the one for you. You should always be free to remember Noah and love him and grieve him. Staying close with his family will be such a blessing for your kids. You can and will find someone who is secure enough with themselves not to be threatened by a dead man's memory, someone who will want to blend his life with yours and not ask you to give up a part of yourself in order to be with them. I'm so sorry for your loss. You are an amazing mom to those kids.", "My wife died when my youngest daughter was 3.5 months old(she's 4 now) and your story is one reason I don't date at all.

I can't tell you what to do with your new bf but good luck, you are NTAH.", "A couple of thoughts. \n\nFirst off - NTA\n\nYou are doing you and taking care of your boys and keeping the memory of their dad going strong and keeping a relationship with their grandparents.  This is all well and good and admirable. \n\nWhat you learned here in this episode is maybe a little bit about yourself, maybe it warrants some introspection, and some self reflection.  I am not suggesting that you are doing anything at all that is unhealthy.  But perhaps you are not quite ready to move onto a relationship with someone else. \n\nHowever, what you learned more than anything is about Rick.  Rick drew his boundaries and he is not wrong to respect them, but those boundaries don't align with your wants or needs.  \n\nFor a man to date a woman who is for all practical purposes a widow, and to respect that relationship and all that it entails, is not an easy thing.  This is much different even from dating someone who has kids with an ex.  There are men out there who can do this, but it is not run of the mill. \n\nSo, NTA.  Rick isn't the guy for you, or at least not the guy for the person you are right now.  And that's ok.  Two people can simply not be AH and still not be right for one another because they have different visions and goals for their lives. \n\nBest of luck", "Nta. Noah\u2019s family has been a part of your life since you were 16 and are your children\u2019s blood family. It\u2019s great that you are close with them.

No, thank you.", "NTA - I am still very close with my ex\u2019s mum (our kids grandmother) she is a second mum to me. My current partner hated it to start with but that\u2019s a him problem to work out his own insecurities about it he did. Now we all spend Christmas together", "You are literally attached to that man\u2019s family tree via your children. Not to mention, the way you speak of him, he seemed to be a best friend on top of being your partner. Your hopefully ex boyfriend and parents are weird for thinking like that and frankly rude as hell for saying it out loud. NTA.", "Tell Rick he has nothing to be concerned about as he is your ex from now on, and certainly not part of your family, unlike your kids' grandmother. Problem solved.\n\nSeriously though, NTA. You deserve someone more mature than that.", "From how you describe your relationship with Noah\u2019s mother, you are very clearly family. It\u2019s absolutely not weird at all. Your new partner\u2019s reaction to this is dumb and pathetic. Your parent\u2019s reaction is bizarre. NTA.", "It sounds like your boyfriend and your family are treating him like an ex-boyfriend when he's not, he's your late fiance. Honestly, I think that's a pretty big red flag with your boyfriend. If I was dating someone who had a partner pass away, I couldn't even imagine pulling what he's pulling. It's completely understandable to have photos up, and to have a relationship with your in-laws", "NTA. I love that you are close with Noah's family. You're giving Noah's mom an incredible gift, and being close to you and the twins probably means the world to her. \ud83d\udc9c\n\n\nMy vote is to get rid of Rick. He's the one that isn't family. The person you are with should recognize that you'll always have a place in your heart for Noah and be respectful of that.", "NTA. I'd drop Rick asap. Noah's mother is a very dear friend, and the twins add another layer to that connection. You need someone who will respect that you had a life before them and that you will continue to be in contact with Noah's mother.", "NTA who TF does Rick think he is to dictate anything about your life. You grieve as long as you want. The fact that he is trying to tell you what to do in regards to your family is a huge red flag. Your parents are wrong to push you with this. You probably aren\u2019t really ready to let that part go and that is okay. Maybe see a therapist.", "NTA. You are definitely family. You are exactly the kind of family people want; family that fosters relationships for their kids and remains in touch. There are divorced families this close too. \n\nI don\u2019t usually yell red flag, but bf wanting to remove Noah\u2019s pics from your home is concerning. He\u2019s your kids dad; they should always have pics of him available and you and they should be able to talk about him freely and openly. A truly mature partner won\u2019t be jealous or icked out by this. If you continue with your new bf I worry that he will eventually want to make even the children not talk of their dad. A good partner will foster the kids remembering their dad while finding his own place to shine in the family.", "NTA. Dump Rick\u2019s ass. You are not seeing Rick because Noah left you (dumped). You\u2019re single because Noah died. Your relationship with Noah (and his Mom) is very close because you guys make it work. You guys are good people.

One year she bought me tickets to a show for my birthday and we went ALLL together including my new husband.   She is my family.

Noah\u2019s family is your family. You\u2019re always going to have ties to them. If your partner has an issue with it, he\u2019s not the right partner for you.

Not twins but two kids, early death and a widow who's technically not family. She made an effort to be involved for the kids cause it's their family and she was treated like any other aunt. In fact, she was kinda more revered for making efforts and making herself family than blood relatives who were just expected to by default..\n\nThe kids would have lost half their extended family if she didn't. \n\nAnd it goes beyond that. Any future partners should be supportive of your grief and the fact that you have a support system, and that the kids had a father that they want to remember.", "What! You are absolutely part of his family! If he hadn't passed, sounds like you'd still be together,  right? You two didn't separate because you broke up, he died, you still love him, and you always will. You have his children, which you will teach them about loving with all your heart, even through death. If his family loves and includes you and the children together,  that is a gift that your children will appreciate in the future.

They were there for her when he died and, like your situation, could understand her grief as they were grieving too. Those relationships were something her new husband had to accept if he was going to pursue a relationship with my sister.

You still involved with them is healthy and normal because your still family even if you are not married and heck even if you didn\u2019t have kids together your still family because family is not blood or legal documents saying you are.

I\u2019m sorry but drop the guy and find someone who can understand you have a blended family and can accept that your late fianc\u00e9s family is in your life for you and your kids cause there was a bond even before you and your fianc\u00e9 were even together it sounds like!", "NTA but Rick definitely is. I think what happened is he felt threatened by the fact that you clearly were deeply in love with Noah and he felt inadequate because you didn't immediately forget all about Noah and become all about Rick when he walked into the picture. But what he doesn't understand is that, since Noah died, you will never be able to completely \"get over\" him\u2014and no one who loves you would ask you to. You will always love him, he will always have a piece of your heart, but eventually you will learn how to make space for someone new in your heart that you will love just as much, if not even more. Maybe you're there, maybe you're not, only time and experience will tell, but that's what happens when you're a widow. Clearly Rick isn't mature enough to be that person. Secondly, no one could ask you to stop being involved with Noah's family because they are your kids' blood relatives. *Maybe* if you didn't have the twins, you would eventually not interact so much with Noah's family as you grew closer to a new partner's family, although I don't think you would ever stop talking to them completely, especially his mom, but with the twins involved? They 100% deserve to have full and unfettered access to their dad's family, and I see no reason why you can't or shouldn't be involved as well.

Thus if he plans to build a life with her he needs to accept this fact. \n\nEven if Rick lived with OP and the twins, she had every right to keep photos of Noah around.

I\u2019d let Rick go simply for suggesting you dump your children\u2019s grandmother. To be jealous of a dead person and their family is a no go. Even if you have been slow to move on this is beyond a red flag. The healthiest thing would be when Rick is ready to go on vacations with you.. not cut off contact with grandma.

When my ex husband died just after his daughter (with his new wife) was born she and his family kept each other afloat. When she remarried, her new husband became a part of their family too. He honors her past and brings up her late husband often, so their children (they've had more since) can hear stories about him regularly. His pictures are on the wall. He's alive in that household and her new husband is a huge part of that. \n\nBecause that is what supportive partners do. Especially when children are involved.

Did they ever complain about how much time you and Noah spent with his family when he was alive? Because honestly they sound jealous more than anything else. \n\nYou sound like you\u2019ve built a lovely connection between your children, the father they never got to meet, and a family that loves all three of you.

Getting married is just paperwork, having his kid and knowing his mother for 11 years is a lot more important to being part of the family.\n\nThe only part that had any validity would be the pictures of Noah.  Obviously some should stay up, he is the kids father.  But without walking through your house I can't really say if you have a tasteful amount of pictures of Noah up, or a creepy amount or somewhere in between.\n\nI'd feel weird dating a woman a who had dozens of pictures of her ex up, even if he were dead.

In her eyes, you've been family since you got with Noah... trust me on that. Never let a significant other demand something so ridiculous from you like Rick, he will only get more controlling as time goes on. He doesn't even live with you yet and he wants to demand you change your entire life for him? Pathetic on his part, tbh. Sounds like he's a bit jealous. \n\n My friend Matt was a police officer, and passed away last September at 27 because of a faulty trigger in his service weapon. (has happened to multiple officers now unfortunately) It went off in his holster and ruptured an artery, just a few months before him and his fiancee planned on tying the knot. Matt was an only child, and only had one child himself, his parents just haven't been the same since he passed. His fiancee Destiny still spends dinners and most nights at Matt's parent's house with her child and the child they had as a couple\n\nMy ex boyfriend Dylan who's also a cop (he was Matt's best friend and the one who introduced me to him) still picks me up at least once or twice a month to go visit Matt's parents and grandparents. We go and help them with things like clearing heavy branches, taking out trash, weeding their garden, mowing, and shooting guns in the backyard range with Matt's dad. It was the same thing we used to do together with Matt, and fuck it's so hard sometimes.\n\nMy current boyfriend has no issue with this, he understands what happened and that nothing weird is going on. It's simply being there for grieving parents and grandparents  who will never have a chance to see their boy down the aisle. It's being there for his grandparents, slipping into dementia, who break down into tears when we have to tell him why we're there but not Matt.
