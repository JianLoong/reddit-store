Sure. But medical emergencies are often deeply inconvenient.

Part of living in bum fuck no where is having contingency plans in place. I also grew up in middle of no where. If our family had had an emergency, where taking kids along was gonna be hard, my parents would have called (yes, in the middle of the night) one of a few different neighbours. We would have been dropped off there or someone would have came to our house. As an adult living in a small city, I\u2019ve been woken up in the middle of the night by a friend needing me to come watch her kids - because her mom was dying and she needed her husband to drive her.

Whether you needed it immediately or whether it could have waited until morning is something you and your wife will find out. \n\nCarting young children out twice within one night is rough and I understand why your wife didn\u2019t want to do that. She would have either had to do 4 hours worth of driving with them (if they chose to go back home while you were in the ER) or she would have had to somehow keep them contained and rested while in the ER with you. \n\nTo me, this really comes down to poor planning on your end and that\u2019s a shared responsibility that you both failed on. \n\nI hope you are better soon. And I hope that you and your wife will make plans for the future - who lives nearby/on the way that you can contact if something happens again.

NTA, of course.", "That\u2019s what I was wondering!", "Blurry vision and almost blacking out from a coughing attack can be attributed to lack of oxygen during the attack. \n\nWould I go to the ER for this?  Nope\n\nWould I drag my kids out of bed to be taken to the ER for this? Hell, no. \n\nWould I drink some hot coffee or tea with caffeine to help open up my lungs? Yes\n\nWould I google home remedies if I wasn\u2019t sure what to do to try to stop this cough before posting on Reddit? Yes", "Yeah this is answer. I can imagine the discussion with the doctor:\nI coughed a lot then nearly passed out\nYou have a cough, drink some soup and sleep", "You could wait in the waiting room. It\u2019s not like the ER is going to have you in and out in an hour. You could easily wait 6 hours to be seen.", "That still doesn't solve the problem of the kids and OP talking about it being about the ride home.\n\nIt is more than a little work to bring the kids on a road-trip like this, what is needed here is a third adult to either drive or babysit.\n\nNAH", "What is a \u201cman cold\u201d and why would it have anything to do with this guy not wanting to be a road hazard", "In my experience the nurses line almost always suggests the ER.", "I agree with you. As a parent myself I would not want to get my kids into the car at night and drive two hours with kids that should be sleeping in their beds. If you mess with a kids sleep schedule you have a kid that will probably not sleep well for a week or even longer. Especially the one year old. Besides, children will be awake at their normal time so they would not get enough sleep. So I get why this mother would not want to drive that far. \n\nAnd I also get why he did not want to drive himself due to safety issues. \nNAH.\n\nSo there indeed should be a close friend or family member to help out in these kind of emergencies. Maybe to watch the children or to drive. I get uber is not an option but maybe OP could take a cab/ taxi? Hospitals are mostly not in the middle of nowhere so taxi companies should be there, shouldn\u2019t it? Or maybe there is a hotel nearby the hospital where you can sleep until your wife can take the kids to pick you up, OP?", "I think the real possibility of dying in a car crash because you blacked out is a bit more of an inconvenience than getting the kids out of the house.\n\nNTA.", "Nice plate of man-hating sexism you\u2019ve got there!", "To be fair even in American bullshit-crazy-healthcare terms, calling an ambulance here seems reasonable. OP is an hour away from his wife minimum, anything could happen in just that period, she could arrive to an unconscious husband - what could she do at that point? Try to resuscitate whilst keeping the infants calm and also driving him to the hospital? Or ring an ambulance and lose an hour from of OP had rang an ambulance?", "NAH this is an occasion where you call on a third adult.", "The drive TO the hospital wasn\u2019t a concern you said. So basically it was the drive home from the ER that is worrisome? Then it doesn\u2019t matter what your wife will or won\u2019t do with small children in the middle of the night to drive you back to your car. The hospital shouldn\u2019t allow you out until you were well enough to leave and then you can wait until someone can get you. At this point it wouldn\u2019t be an emergency.", "INFO: If taking an ambulance is not an issue, why not take an ambulance to get there and have your wife come pick you up when they\u2019re ready to release you? You also might spend a while in the hospital, and that would give the kids time to sleep and her time to get them up and ready for the drive.", "Honestly I don't get why you cannot call an ambulante and then stay at the hospital until morning.\nIf you guys are discussing that she might need to pick you up right away in the middle of the night, doesn't that kinda imply that neither of you really believes that its serious?\nIn that case, why not wait until the kids are up and call your normal physician?\nAlso, what is he treating you for? \nI see all the ntas, and - as a mother of three, who die have to wake up kids in the middle of the night for medical emergencies - i actually think this is YTA.", "Absolutely NTA! I'm sorry, but how selfish can she be? Those \"sickness and health\" wedding vows aren't just for when it's convenient. I would be very upset. \n\n Unfortunately, this is topic I know all too well. I have a rare, debilitating disease and my husband has diabetes, asthma, and some other conditions. There are times where we feel like we're just taking turns playing caretaker. It sucks, but you can't leave your partner in a dangerous medical situation. Sometimes that means dragging the kids along, but we mostly try to get family/friends to babysit while we deal with whatever medical emergency. \n\nYou were absolutely right for not driving yourself. And your wife should have at least tried to get babysitters or just bit the bullet and drug the kids along.", "NTA. I thought that was something spouses just *do* for each other, provided they\u2019re capable of doing it (one time I couldn\u2019t take my husband to the hospital because I didn\u2019t know how to drive. He asked his mom to do it).", "NTA.\n\nYou mentioned that it's the drive back that worries you, and everyone is telling you off because that shouldn't happen in the middle of the night. I don't know what country you're in, but in the UK at least, they don't care what time it is. If you're well enough to leave the hospital, then they show you the door at any time of the day or night.\n\nThat said, is there anyone else who can drive you, or look after the kids while your wife drives? If you have friends or family nearby, it's time to ask for their help. Your symptoms sound extremely concerning, you need to get looked at ASAP, even if it means you're stuck at the hospital until you figure out a way home. They may not want you taking up a bed, but I doubt they would have a problem with you occupying a seat in one of the waiting rooms until you sorted this out.", "NTA.  Any other family nearby that can watch the kids instead of having to take them?  Or neighbors?", "NTA. You should probably be reconsidering if this is the woman you'd die for, when apparently she won't even inconvenience herself to stop you from dying.\n\nNever drive if you are not safe to be driving. If push comes to shove, take an ambulance to the ER, and perhaps someone in the community like a police officer or truck driver may be willing to give you a ride home. Live another day and seriously consider getting a partner who will be there for you", "NTA my ex husband was like this...I actually broke 2 toes during the night...he refused to take me to the hospital...made me wait till the morning...said I was making it up...one toe was sticking out the other way. Your wife doesn't sound any different...its an inconvenience to them...unless they are ill..then its all about them", "NTA, from a mother of two young kids.", "I can\u2019t believe how inconsiderate you are. You should have just died (and possibly taken another few road users with you) rather than mildly inconvenience your wife. Selfish of you, really. NTA", "Right, sounds like an overrecaction to me, unless there is an underlying health condition where coughing is a sign of an impending emergency. Take meds, drink fluids and rest for a while. Contact primary care in the morning if you have one, or wait a few days and go to urgent care if one is available and it isn't clearing up.", "She wanted me to drive there so she wouldn't have to  come get me upon release. That was what I disagreed with.", "I was directed by an after hours nurse hotline to go to the ER. It's just a cough and the fuzzy vision is a new symptom, we werent concerned but typically we listen to medical professionals. We both work so it was either come get me in the middle of the night so we can stick to the normal routine in the morning. Or she gets up, makes breakfast for the kids, gets them ready for school / day care (which i do so she can sleep more). To come get me, to go get my car for both of us to drive our separate commutes to work.", "I don\u2019t want to be on the roads when someone who is blacking out is behind the wheel.", "Sometimes there just isn't multiple people to help.", "I've had the cough two ish weeks, and have been to the urgent care (as directed by my primary doctors office) and worked with my primary. I was told to go to the ER by an after hours nurse hotline due to the onset of the new symptoms. I personally wouldn't call it an emergency but I'm not a medical professional so I was just taking their advice.\nShe wanted me to avoid an ambulance so that I could get myself home after.", "You're not a very good troll, are you?", "Unfortunately not, my in-laws \"could\" but won't. And my nearest family would be doing a 3 hour round trip and it's my mom who gets nervous driving at night.", "You\u2019re already assuming she wouldn\u2019t even pick you up\u2026?", "They were blacking out whilst driving. As well as being illegal, it could also cause a fatal crash", "NTA. Tell your wife to suck it up. Your health is more important than her inconvenience. The 1 and 8 year old will be just fine. Seriously reconsider whether you want to spend the rest of your life with some one that cares so little for you.", "Especially, if he thinks he will have to get Back that same night, doesn't that imply he doesn't really think its serious?", "You\u2019re already assuming she wouldn\u2019t even pick you up\u2026? Like if you were to get yourself there, would she at least pack up the kids to pick up their father from the hospital?", "Right, so be home resting and not out driving.", "Sorry if your spouse is possibly dying, you may just need to deal with the inconvenience.", "This was what she didn't want to do. She wanted me to risk driving myself instead of her / ambulance taking me. So she didn't have to come get me as I would be without a means of transportation.", "Some women like to be martyrs and pretend they\u2019re the only ones who get sick and \u201cplay through the pain\u201d so to speak, and that any time a man gets sick they\u2019re faking or over-exaggerating. Usually this is tied to people who tie their identity to being mothers\n\nKeep in mind this is a completely nonsensical notion given that it\u2019s been shown that men are much less likely than women to seek medical treatment and try to admit everything is fine", "So she would black out in front of her kids and traumatize them? That\u2019s good parenting?", "That was the first time they had experienced the black outs (hence their wanting to go to A&E). Were they supposed to just teleport home?", "Nurses line always just tell you to go to hospital. It's pointless in Australia. Heck, I had cysts that burst and they told me to drive to hospital even after I told them I had been drinking. My partner at the time was unlicensed/never had one and had also been drinking. Their answer was drive anyway. \nThe idea of it was to stop so many people from going to the er but they send everyone there for everything.", "He\u2019s not asking for a lift to and from the pub. He\u2019s asking for a lift to and from the hospital, where it would be dangerous for him to drive back. He wouldn\u2019t just be putting himself in danger but others as well. This is one thing where you just get on with it and deal with crabby children for the week. She is 100% TA.", "I'm guessing you have no love for your children's other parent? I'm sure if he ends up in a car crash or dies the kid's sleep pattern would be far more messed up.\n\nIf I called someone begging for help and they said anything in that last paragraph to me, our relationship would never be the same. I would drop anything and inconvenience myself in any way to help someone I love who was calling me for support. \n\nShow up for the people who show up for you or one day when you call for help, no one will answer.", "I know that Uber usually has a policy where they won't take to a hospital due to liabilities. I feel like a cab/taxi would be the same way. \n\nMaybe on the way back to the car. That's has been sitting abandoned on the side of the road for who knows how long. But honestly, the payment would not be worth it. I'd rather wake up my daughter and do.it if a close neighbor isn't able to babysit. I'm not leaving my sick husband to figure this shit out. And I would hope he would do the same for me.", "That\u2019s incredibly selfish of her wow. Do you have any friends or family who could look after the kids or take you? Dude get yourself medically straightened out and then figure out if your marriage is even worth staying in. She\u2019d rather risk you passing out, crashing, and dying than inconvenience herself for your health. That\u2019s absolute shit spouse behavior", "I was referred to the ER Sunday for stomach pains. I went to urgent care per the nurse advice line. They heard stomach pains and said \"nope, you need imaging and only the er can do that.\" It wasn't life threatening, but that's where you get sent.", "Yep, Australia and Australia is nothing like the U.S if you have a concession card and Medicare card the ambulance ride is free. If you earn too much you can get full ambulance cover for a small yearly fee. I think it's something like 100 dollars. \nThe only people who pay thousands are those who are idiots who think they're invincible and earn too much but even they can pay the debt off in small increment affordable instalments."]}
