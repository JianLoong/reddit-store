Imagine having to drag the kids out to their father\u2019s funeral because you felt like it was an inconvenience to drive him to the hospital.", "NTA. Definitely not the AH. Your wife needs to revisit the whole \"in sickness and in heath\" part of the marriage agreement. Why she would refuse to drive you during what was clearly a medical emergency is beyond me. It's really concerning.", "NTA. I get that your wife is probably tired, but having small kids myself, I have driven my husband who cut his hand to the ER with 2 kids I had to wake up to get into the car. It isn't fun, but it isn't safe to drive yourself.", "Are you kidding me? NTA. In no way are you the AH here. Your wife actually wanted you to legitimately risk your life driving an hour to the hospital so she wouldn't have to box up the kids and be inconvenienced a little bit one night? How's she gonna manage if you died in a wreck or seriously injured yourself? That would be pretty inconvenient then having to raise those kids alone, no? Your wife is a major AH for that.", "NTA you made some great judgement decisions regarding safety as a fellow driver I thank you. \n\nCall a cab or an ambulance if she won't grab you.", "What's more inconvenient?

Suggesting that you get behind the wheel of a car for an hour-long drive to the hospital (or at all, for that matter) when you'd just had a medical episode involving blurred vision and nearly fainting is staggeringly irresponsible and dangerous!! \n\nWould it have been inconvenient for her to take you? Sure. But medical emergencies are often deeply inconvenient. When I got sick as an infant only months after my parents had moved to a new city, my mother had to ask neighbours that she barely knew, also in the middle of the night, to come watch my toddler sister so she and my dad could take me to the hospital. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO IN AN EMERGENCY. \n\nYour wife should have driven you or y'all should have called an ambulance, but even then she'd have been an AH for even suggesting that you drive. You are definitely NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.  Sometimes people are inconvenienced by the lives of other people - even people we love.  Feel free to call your wife's family members and ask if one of them can either drive you or watch the kids, because your wife is being unreasonable and is waiting for you to pass out and crash while driving, just so she can avoid taking the kids out to pick you up late at night.

Do NOT drive yourself to the hospital, but you should definitely go. Phone a friend, pay $100 for an Uber, call an ambulance! Do not drive if there is ANY risk of losing consciousness.

Heading to something or home? You probably should have just gone to the er at that time.", "NTA - but do you have anyone to watch your kids in situations like this? A parent? Aunt? Uncle?", "INFO - are there no family members without kids, rideshares like Uber or Lyft, or cabs in your location?", "NTA. You needed medical attention ASAP and her priority was that she didn't want to have to deal with the kids. \n\nHow about not dealing with a dad because he doesn't get medical treatment? \n\nI'd honestly bring this up.

What you described is just the result of coughing too hard.  YTA for expecting your wife and little ones to be out in the middle of the night.", "NTA\n\nI hope you are feeling better.", "NTA.

Part of living in bum fuck no where is having contingency plans in place. I also grew up in middle of no where. If our family had had an emergency, where taking kids along was gonna be hard, my parents would have called (yes, in the middle of the night) one of a few different neighbours. We would have been dropped off there or someone would have came to our house. As an adult living in a small city, I\u2019ve been woken up in the middle of the night by a friend needing me to come watch her kids - because her mom was dying and she needed her husband to drive her. I woke up and walked there (I don\u2019t drive) in the middle of winter with my pjs still on. It was an emergency and she KNEW she could call me and that I would be there asap. \n\nYou didn\u2019t have a plan in advance and that is on both of you. Living so far away from emergency care means you NEED to have a plan. You have to be prepared. You weren\u2019t and now look at the mess you\u2019re in. \n\nYou need hospital care. Whether you needed it immediately or whether it could have waited until morning is something you and your wife will find out. \n\nCarting young children out twice within one night is rough and I understand why your wife didn\u2019t want to do that. She would have either had to do 4 hours worth of driving with them (if they chose to go back home while you were in the ER) or she would have had to somehow keep them contained and rested while in the ER with you. \n\nTo me, this really comes down to poor planning on your end and that\u2019s a shared responsibility that you both failed on. \n\nI hope you are better soon. And I hope that you and your wife will make plans for the future - who lives nearby/on the way that you can contact if something happens again. You need a list of multiple people, because there\u2019s no guarantee that someone will be home, answer their phone, or be able to help out at any given time.

But willful ignorance and foolish pride makes you live an hour away from treatment when your kid get appendicitis or is allergic to bees?", "Judging from your grammar you're not from the US (Australia?) and likely don't have experience with our healthcare system. Calling an ambulance is incredibly expensive and never taken lightly. It's normal to not call an ambulance unless you are unconscious or in a life threatening situation.
