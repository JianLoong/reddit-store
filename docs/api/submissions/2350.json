If you are blacking out, you shouldn't be behind the wheel. Will your insurance cover an ambulance ride?", "NTA. Imagine having to drag the kids out to their father\u2019s funeral because you felt like it was an inconvenience to drive him to the hospital.", "NTA. Definitely not the AH. Your wife needs to revisit the whole \"in sickness and in heath\" part of the marriage agreement. Why she would refuse to drive you during what was clearly a medical emergency is beyond me. It's really concerning.", "NTA. I get that your wife is probably tired, but having small kids myself, I have driven my husband who cut his hand to the ER with 2 kids I had to wake up to get into the car. It isn't fun, but it isn't safe to drive yourself.", "Are you kidding me? NTA. In no way are you the AH here. Your wife actually wanted you to legitimately risk your life driving an hour to the hospital so she wouldn't have to box up the kids and be inconvenienced a little bit one night? How's she gonna manage if you died in a wreck or seriously injured yourself? That would be pretty inconvenient then having to raise those kids alone, no? Your wife is a major AH for that.", "NTA you made some great judgement decisions regarding safety as a fellow driver I thank you. \n\nCall a cab or an ambulance if she won't grab you.", "What's more inconvenient?   Hauling the kids out for a drive to the hospital, or having a husband that dies/kills someone else because he blacks out while driving himself to the hospital?    \n\nNTA", "**NTA** but your wife is a huge one.\n\nYou were having what sounds like a legitimate medical emergency. Suggesting that you get behind the wheel of a car for an hour-long drive to the hospital (or at all, for that matter) when you'd just had a medical episode involving blurred vision and nearly fainting is staggeringly irresponsible and dangerous!! \n\nWould it have been inconvenient for her to take you? Sure. But medical emergencies are often deeply inconvenient. When I got sick as an infant only months after my parents had moved to a new city, my mother had to ask neighbours that she barely knew, also in the middle of the night, to come watch my toddler sister so she and my dad could take me to the hospital. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO IN AN EMERGENCY. \n\nYour wife should have driven you or y'all should have called an ambulance, but even then she'd have been an AH for even suggesting that you drive. You are definitely NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.  Sometimes people are inconvenienced by the lives of other people - even people we love.  Feel free to call your wife's family members and ask if one of them can either drive you or watch the kids, because your wife is being unreasonable and is waiting for you to pass out and crash while driving, just so she can avoid taking the kids out to pick you up late at night.  I mean, I know it's last minute, but can't she (or you; but I'm giving you a pass because, sick) find a sitter for the evening/night?\n\nMy mother used to drag my siblings and me back and forth to the hospital at seemingly all hours after my dad suffered a sudden heart attack when I was young.  We all survived.  Now I work in healthcare, in fact.\n\nPlease get somewhere to get help.  I don't know you, but I'm worried about you.  I don't want you driving, either.", "NTA at all! Do NOT drive yourself to the hospital, but you should definitely go. Phone a friend, pay $100 for an Uber, call an ambulance! Do not drive if there is ANY risk of losing consciousness. And DO go to the ER. Coughing like that could be anything from an infection to potentially fatal blood clots.\n\nYour wife is a total AH!", "NTA. OP I had a one year old and when my husband woke me up with CHEST PAINS, would you like to know what I did? I drove my terrified husband and very sleepy, cranky 1yr old to the ER without a second thought. At 3am. Because that\u2019s what you DO.", "NTA. Do you have any neighbors or friends you can ask for a ride?", "NTA", "NTA. You were not safe to drive and the fact that she was more concerned with dragging the kids out of the house than your safety is uncool.", "Where were you when this happened? Heading to something or home? You probably should have just gone to the er at that time.", "NTA - but do you have anyone to watch your kids in situations like this? A parent? Aunt? Uncle?", "INFO - are there no family members without kids, rideshares like Uber or Lyft, or cabs in your location?", "NTA. You needed medical attention ASAP and her priority was that she didn't want to have to deal with the kids. \n\nHow about not dealing with a dad because he doesn't get medical treatment? \n\nI'd honestly bring this up. This is a serious issue that she can't see how your life is far more important than the 'inconvenience' of saddling up your children.", "YTA.  911 would be a better option than making your wife drag your kids with you to the ER for an indeterminate amount of time.  \n\nI realize you had blurry vision and almost blacked out, but there are other ways you could have gotten help without getting your kids up and dragging the family to the ER.", "NAH.  You and wife need better problem solving skills if the first thing you do is try to place blame on who is the asshole. You\u2019re a team", "NTA sounds like when I had covid. It can be serious", "you are being vague about your medical condition. Can you elaborate on it within the bounds of  anonymity ? Cuz to me, while I wouldn't want to drive with that either, that doesn't quite sound like something that needs to be checked that night?", "I'm pretty sure a local urgent care would have been able to help you.  What you described is just the result of coughing too hard.  YTA for expecting your wife and little ones to be out in the middle of the night.", "NTA\n\nI hope you are feeling better.", "NTA. Your wife cares more about her own convenience than about risking your life and the lives of others on the road... I would rethink whether she even loves you or not.", "Call an ambulance?", "ESH - Let me spell it for you - AMBULANCE - During a medical emergency you don't call your wife you call an AMBULANCE.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019d pack for a long day with the kids. Blankets, food, drinks and some toys. Probably get a hotel for night if it got real late.", "NTA bet you\u2019re triggering your vasovagal reflex.

Yes lets go with that option instead of taking the kids for a drive.", "You're aware 911 is for emergencies right? Having blurry vision/being dizzy isn't an emergency.", "If this was who needs to clean the kitchen sure. But OP literally can't drive himself to the hospital without risking the life of himself and everyone else on the road. His wife is the one refusing to be a partner here. Idk what else he really could do in the situation except shell out hundreds-thousands on an ambulance ride or a very expensive Uber/taxi", "It's just a cough along with a coarse wheezing feeling when I breathe.

I\u2019ve experienced exactly one ambulance ride and it was ridiculous how expensive one ride was. I don\u2019t blame anyone for not wanting to use one when they could drive instead. And many insurances do not cover them so it\u2019s all out of pocket.

As for your argument about the ride home, she would at least have time to find someone to watch the kids and then come get you. \n\nYou do know there are lot of OTC medications for a cough? How many days have you been ill? Have you even tried self medicating before the ER? The ER is not a doctors office, you should give an illness a couple days to resolve if you just got sick, if you just got sick and you are so bad you need the ER, you should 100% call an ambulance. Your wife won\u2019t be able to both drive and take care of you.", "I\u2019m going to go INFO here\u2026 do you black out often? You were coughing - do you have RSV or another illness? We\u2019re you driving at the time or does this happen randomly? Were the fits in the same night? When did you ask? What are your jobs like?

I\u2019d tell her either she takes you or you\u2019re calling an ambulance. By the time you\u2019re done at the ER it\u2019ll be morning. She\u2019s ridiculous for not taking you though. I hope you were able to get to the ER and get checked out.", "NTA. Your wife doesn\u2019t sound like she cares much about your health.

But at that point you\u2019re safer going to a doctor and verifying\n\nAlso, a cough not going down after taking medicine, doesn\u2019t mean that you need an ambulance over a different ride.

Taking them to their father\u2019s funeral", "No, you don't.  Besides a potential cost of over $6,000, you'd be taking away an ambulance from somebody who could possibly need it even more.  Strapped in the damn kids and drive your spouse to the hospital!", "Common 3rd-time-lucky L", "Never in all my first aid courses or anything like that has blackout ever been a need for resus. Not breathing, no heartbeat yes definitely resus. My late husband has a lot of health problems and it was quicker for me to drive him to the hospital more than an hour away than to get an ambulance. Also I have seen many people released from hospital at all hours of the night (not if they have been admitted but from emergency)", "This is so true. It's likely she would be taking care of the kids, cleaning the house and feeling like forget the ER, she didn't even have time to black out in peace.", "Blood clots most definitely can, and do, cause \"a cough\". \n\nPulmonary embolism has similar symptoms to conditions like heart attack, aortic dissection, and pneumonia. Symptoms may vary greatly depending on a range of factors, including the size of the clot and the patient's overall health. The most common symptoms include: Coughing (in rare cases, accompanied by blood).", "If you live in a more rural area, Uber cars aren't circling around.", "OP was blacking out, in his own words. Therefore potentially needed resus. How are the kids going to resus him while Mum is driving, or the kids drive while Mum does resus?\n\nI called an ambulance for a neighbour in a similar situation once, he was angry. The ambo's thanked me for NOT trying to drive him through the night, putting us both in danger.", "OP said he nearly blacked out, not that he actually did. And even if he had, I don\u2019t see how that relates to resuscitation. \n\nAnd let\u2019s say he did need resuscitation, in the hour that they\u2019re waiting for the ambulance to arrive at their house, what are the wife/kids going to do? IMO, that time is better spent driving to the hospital and in the event something truly did happen, you call 911 and follow instructions.\n\nYou can pull over on the side of the road, if you need to."]}
