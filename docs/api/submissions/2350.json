If you are blacking out, you shouldn't be behind the wheel. Will your insurance cover an ambulance ride?", "NTA. Imagine having to drag the kids out to their father\u2019s funeral because you felt like it was an inconvenience to drive him to the hospital.", "NTA. Definitely not the AH. Your wife needs to revisit the whole \"in sickness and in heath\" part of the marriage agreement. Why she would refuse to drive you during what was clearly a medical emergency is beyond me. It's really concerning.", "NTA. I get that your wife is probably tired, but having small kids myself, I have driven my husband who cut his hand to the ER with 2 kids I had to wake up to get into the car. It isn't fun, but it isn't safe to drive yourself.", "Are you kidding me? NTA. In no way are you the AH here. Your wife actually wanted you to legitimately risk your life driving an hour to the hospital so she wouldn't have to box up the kids and be inconvenienced a little bit one night? How's she gonna manage if you died in a wreck or seriously injured yourself? That would be pretty inconvenient then having to raise those kids alone, no? Your wife is a major AH for that.", "NTA you made some great judgement decisions regarding safety as a fellow driver I thank you. \n\nCall a cab or an ambulance if she won't grab you.", "What's more inconvenient?   Hauling the kids out for a drive to the hospital, or having a husband that dies/kills someone else because he blacks out while driving himself to the hospital?    \n\nNTA", "**NTA** but your wife is a huge one.\n\nYou were having what sounds like a legitimate medical emergency. Suggesting that you get behind the wheel of a car for an hour-long drive to the hospital (or at all, for that matter) when you'd just had a medical episode involving blurred vision and nearly fainting is staggeringly irresponsible and dangerous!! \n\nWould it have been inconvenient for her to take you? Sure. But medical emergencies are often deeply inconvenient. When I got sick as an infant only months after my parents had moved to a new city, my mother had to ask neighbours that she barely knew, also in the middle of the night, to come watch my toddler sister so she and my dad could take me to the hospital. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO IN AN EMERGENCY. \n\nYour wife should have driven you or y'all should have called an ambulance, but even then she'd have been an AH for even suggesting that you drive. You are definitely NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.  Sometimes people are inconvenienced by the lives of other people - even people we love.  Feel free to call your wife's family members and ask if one of them can either drive you or watch the kids, because your wife is being unreasonable and is waiting for you to pass out and crash while driving, just so she can avoid taking the kids out to pick you up late at night.  I mean, I know it's last minute, but can't she (or you; but I'm giving you a pass because, sick) find a sitter for the evening/night?\n\nMy mother used to drag my siblings and me back and forth to the hospital at seemingly all hours after my dad suffered a sudden heart attack when I was young.  We all survived.  Now I work in healthcare, in fact.\n\nPlease get somewhere to get help.  I don't know you, but I'm worried about you.  I don't want you driving, either.", "NTA at all! Do NOT drive yourself to the hospital, but you should definitely go. Phone a friend, pay $100 for an Uber, call an ambulance! Do not drive if there is ANY risk of losing consciousness. And DO go to the ER. Coughing like that could be anything from an infection to potentially fatal blood clots.\n\nYour wife is a total AH!", "NTA. OP I had a one year old and when my husband woke me up with CHEST PAINS, would you like to know what I did? I drove my terrified husband and very sleepy, cranky 1yr old to the ER without a second thought. At 3am. Because that\u2019s what you DO.", "NTA. Do you have any neighbors or friends you can ask for a ride?", "NTA", "NTA. You were not safe to drive and the fact that she was more concerned with dragging the kids out of the house than your safety is uncool.", "Where were you when this happened? Heading to something or home? You probably should have just gone to the er at that time.", "NTA - but do you have anyone to watch your kids in situations like this? A parent? Aunt? Uncle?", "INFO - are there no family members without kids, rideshares like Uber or Lyft, or cabs in your location?", "NTA. You needed medical attention ASAP and her priority was that she didn't want to have to deal with the kids. \n\nHow about not dealing with a dad because he doesn't get medical treatment? \n\nI'd honestly bring this up. This is a serious issue that she can't see how your life is far more important than the 'inconvenience' of saddling up your children.", "YTA.  911 would be a better option than making your wife drag your kids with you to the ER for an indeterminate amount of time.  \n\nI realize you had blurry vision and almost blacked out, but there are other ways you could have gotten help without getting your kids up and dragging the family to the ER.", "NAH.  You and wife need better problem solving skills if the first thing you do is try to place blame on who is the asshole. You\u2019re a team", "NTA sounds like when I had covid. It can be serious", "you are being vague about your medical condition. Can you elaborate on it within the bounds of  anonymity ? Cuz to me, while I wouldn't want to drive with that either, that doesn't quite sound like something that needs to be checked that night?", "I'm pretty sure a local urgent care would have been able to help you.  What you described is just the result of coughing too hard.  YTA for expecting your wife and little ones to be out in the middle of the night.", "NTA\n\nI hope you are feeling better.", "NTA. Your wife cares more about her own convenience than about risking your life and the lives of others on the road... I would rethink whether she even loves you or not.", "Call an ambulance?", "ESH - Let me spell it for you - AMBULANCE - During a medical emergency you don't call your wife you call an AMBULANCE.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019d pack for a long day with the kids. Blankets, food, drinks and some toys. Probably get a hotel for night if it got real late.", "NTA bet you\u2019re triggering your vasovagal reflex. Which you cannot control and you absolutely should not be driving. Your wife endangered your life and the lives of everyone on the road. Get to a doc one way or another (preferably not via ambulance because you wrapped your car around a tree)", "WTH! That's not a spouse you can count on. Think about that. How would she feel if you said that to her. NTA", "NTA!\n\nRun, don\u2019t walk, away from this self absorbed m, selfish spouse!", "The issue is the ride home. I'm out in the boonies where uber isn't an option.", "I read this as \"my husband who cut OFF his hand\" and I was so taken back. Like I agree OP is NtA but blurry vision and a severed limb just seemed like two completely different things hahaha", "She probably thinks he\u2019s over reacting or exaggerating. \n\nOP is NTA.  And his wife is being stupid.", "Imagine if the genders were reversed everyone would be screaming leave him \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "No ride shares, and cabs won't make the trek. My nearest family is my mom, about an hour from the er and then another hour to my place so 3 hours round trip for her and she gets nervous driving at night.", "Which could take hours and cost thousands of dollars. Yes lets go with that option instead of taking the kids for a drive.", "You're aware 911 is for emergencies right? Having blurry vision/being dizzy isn't an emergency.", "If this was who needs to clean the kitchen sure. But OP literally can't drive himself to the hospital without risking the life of himself and everyone else on the road. His wife is the one refusing to be a partner here. Idk what else he really could do in the situation except shell out hundreds-thousands on an ambulance ride or a very expensive Uber/taxi", "It's just a cough along with a coarse wheezing feeling when I breathe. I wouldn't normally make a special trip of it, but when I called the after hours nurse number they said ER / Urgent care but would suggest ER. So probably not critical, but I'm just trying to take the direction given to me.", "Until they find out it's a blood clot in his lung and send him to the hospital anyway!", "The issue is the ride home, uber is not an option where I live", "Ambulances are expensive", "Let me spell it out for you - EXPENSIVE - thank you American health care for that. I\u2019ve experienced exactly one ambulance ride and it was ridiculous how expensive one ride was. I don\u2019t blame anyone for not wanting to use one when they could drive instead. And many insurances do not cover them so it\u2019s all out of pocket. Just a separate perspective from someone who\u2019s been there herself.", "So she wants you to drive through little traveled areas, at night, while possibly blacking out. My dude, there is absolutely no way you're TA here.", "Lmao yikes. I would *DEFINITELY* have called an ambulance", "He could have had a stroke, 911 is the right answer,", "What do you think the E in ER stands for?  He either needs to go to ER as an emergency or it can wait until morning for a standard appointment.", "> You might have blurry or double vision. Call 911 right away if you have either of these changes and other stroke warning signs, such as: Dizziness. Face drooping\n\nIt seems you are wrong.", "Not to mention how expensive ambulances are. I've literally had to WALK to the ER before because I simply couldn't afford an ambulance. I can only imagine how expensive an hour long ride would be.", "They need to come together and make an plan for when either of them need to go to the hospital or any other urgent things that come up.", "Yeah, wow. No.", "Where do you live that uber isn't available?", "So that's usa thing? Who pays for an ambulance? Crazy.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Its easily $1,000 if not more to take an ambulance in the good 'ol USA. WITH insurance I might add.", "Unfortunately healthcare isn't free in America.", ">So that's usa thing? Who pays for an ambulance? Crazy.\n\nThe person who it's called for, even if they're unconscious and unconsenting to the medical debt that would ensue.", "Ambulances are independent contracting companies that are most likely not in-network with insurance companies - as a result - can confirm - currently paying off a 10,000$ ride my kid had from one hospital to another.", "What's the point of paying insurance than?", "That is a question we all ask ourselves everyday.  I have worked in Healthcare for years and I have zero good answer for you. It's disgusting."]}
