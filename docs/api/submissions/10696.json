Point this out to your parents. You lived in that unit for two years without issue. You did not need a babysitter to keep you on track academically. You tried to get the partying to stop but they refused to back you up. If brother is having these issues, he probably needs to move into a dorm or transfer closer to home do he can be properly supervised.", "So what exactly did you do, or not do, that was wrong here?\n\nYou're not in the apartment. OK. You're not watching over your brother. Since you're not allowed to have any sort of authority over him, what difference does that make? \n\nAre you supposed to be running around cleaning up his messes, apologising to people for his behaviour, and doing his homework?\n\n...\n\nYou actually are supposed to, in your parents' eyes, aren't you? Like he can do what he wants, and you should be doing the work of 3 people to fix his problems, do his work and housework, and keep up with your own studies and housework.\n\nThat's the secret payment they expect from you for two years' use of the apartment. **Surprise!!** \n\nNTA. Eeeeeesh. Your golden child sibling can fail all on his own -- or your parents can damn well do his homework for him.", "NTA. I'm glad that the two years of freedom you got helped you. It sounds like you are having a good life. And you are more mature than I was at your age.  I was more like your brother. If they want you to temper his behaviour they have to put you on charge of him. Since they won't, and he probably would not have accepted it, you have made the right choice by distancing yourself.", "NTA.\nYour brother is causing the issue, so why are they making you out to be the 'bad' one. Your parents seem to want to make you responsible for your brother, rather than making him responsible for his behaviour. If they aren't willing to put their foot down about him partying too much, you should not have to suffer living with him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.", "NTA. Your parents bought the condo knowing you weren\u2019t social and thought this would be a great solution. Even though its your brother, if he acts worse than a roommate in the dorm\u2019s it makes no sense that this would work for you. If I understand correctly you offered to move back in if he agreed to no parties. That is more than fair on your part.", "NTA, and we\u2019ll done!  You told your parents about the parties, etc. in the beginning and they did nothing.  You did a good job rescuing yourself and moving out.  Now, they want you to go back and babysit your adult younger brother.  You know from experience that will not work.  You were wise to say no.  You saw that it would be a huge headache, a failed effort and would end badly.\n\nReal estate markets are unpredictable.  Once your brother flunks out they can throw him out, or take him back home where he can be a mooch for another 10 years.  They can rent out the condo until the market improves, or sell and take a loss.  Their choice.", "NTA-your brother is fully responsible for this mess. Not sure why your parents coddle him, but I\u2019m glad you declined moving back in because at that point in the story, I was getting very nervous. He is not your child; you should not be taking on parenting him.\n\nEdited to add: If your brother drops out, you can help protect your parents from the financial loss by moving back into the apartment IF your brother is required to move back home. Your arrangement with the uni is probably on a semester basis, so this is at least feasible. \n\nYour parents are having a hard time accepting that they failed your brother as parents. Hopefully, he grows up soon.", "You're NTA for wanting nothing to do with the cops. \n\nYour parents can always evict him then rent it out to someone else, I guess. Market's hot.", "NTA\n\n>I asked if I was allowed to bar him from having parties and stuff. He was part of the conversation and was upset that I was asking to be put in charge of him. My parents said he was allowed some freedom and that as his big sister I should look out for him and not let him fail.\n\nYour parents want to spoil their son but blame you for the consequences of their shitty parenting. You are 100% right to wash your hands of it.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your job to watch your out of control brother. Being a big sister doesn't make you a babysitter. They created this monster by letting him have parties. They want to use you as a scapegoat for their bad parenting.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu escaped. Do not let them make you responsible for your brother's academic success.", "Nta. Your brother is irresponsible and is proving it. \n\nPoint out to them, that you appreciated them getting the apartment and for them to notice how there were no issues or problems with you, your grades, or with the apartment,  until he moved in.\n\nYou getting your own place was the only alternative to keep your own peace..\n\nLet them know that, you wouldnt mind living in the apartment but, your brother has made it uncomfortable for you to be there.", "NTA\n\nYou moved there to study. He moved there to party. He was making it difficult for you to be able to focus on your studies and sleep I'm guessing. On top of all of this, your parents want you to parent him while he is out of the house. Noone needed to parent you when you moved away from home. It is not your responsibility to look after your brother, it's your parents.", "NTA! Totally NTA. A serious student and a partying slacker are not a compatible mix. Parents should have put their foot down with brother immediately.", "NTA. \n\nWhy should you have to parent your younger brother simply because your parents don\u2019t want to? They would rather you live with him and clean up his mess than enforce some sort of boundaries or consequences on his behavior and ensure you both have an environment where you can thrive.\n\nAlso - the condo was likely an investment for them. Usually when this happens parents save money by buying a place near campus for their kid instead of having them live on campus or rent, and they make a  decent ROI when they sell it. Or keep it and use as an investment property. Just to say, it likely wasn\u2019t an 100% altruistic move on their part.", "NTA it's not your job to babysit your brother. His actions are his own and yours are yours. I would of moved out too. If your parents sell the place its because of him not you.", "NTA. Sounds like you\u2019ve made fantastic progress, and used your parents\u2019 gifted apartment to move your life in the direction that you wanted. Your brother, however, is not. You are not his babysitter, and you\u2019re doing the right thing for your life and future. Congratulations on your independence and future success.", "Your NTA for moving out, especially as you did flag up the partying and your parents didn't do anything to mediate or back you up.  They had every right to move your brother in to help him save money but they were wrong to assume that you were going to be willing or able to rein him in.  He's an adult now so I'm not sure how you're supposed to do that.  A better option would be for them to tell him to move out (so the flat is no longer 'party central') and let you move back in until it's a good time for them to sell it.", "NTA. You tried to look out for him and look after him but it's like they didn't want that. He seems like he just wanted somewhere to party", "NTA - but your parents are also NTA. Your brother is the root cause of all these problems. It was totally reasonable for your parents to try this situation out as it\u2019s fair for both of their kids to get the same opportunity (off-campus housing). But once it was demonstrated your brother wasn\u2019t responsible or mature enough to live on his own, he should have been the one to go to on-campus housing. Generally on-campus housing has more restrictions and oversight (not that it matters to you, you\u2019re doing fine, but it would have been more beneficial to your brother to help him mature). It\u2019s not on you to make sure your brother succeeds.", "NTA do what is best for you to succeed.", "NTA. None of this is your fault. They want you to be responsible for controlling the child they can't control, but in doing so you're not allowed to tell him what to do and he doesn't have to exercise self-control. Ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to curb your brother's excesses on more than one occasion and your parents shot you down each time.  So, he's their problem to deal with.\n\nMy guess is that he's absolutely trashing their condo and it's going to be in rough shape when he leaves, too", "You did a great job taking care of yourself! NTA", "The parents could also just rent the condo out. They aren\u2019t going to be in a hole unless they put themselves there to make a point. (Well, except the repairs which I assume will need done once the brother drops out.)", "Agreed!", "NTA. You are not allowed to stop your brother\u2019s partying, yet are supposed to somehow do all your studying and chores AND somehow see to it he does not flunk out?  \n\nYour parents are idiots, that is not possible. Since your parents won\u2019t give you authority over him they created the problem, so he is not YOUR problem. Either your parents need to step up and MANAGE your brother\u2019s bad behavior or he needs to grow up. Or flunk out. \n\nYou made a good move into a place where you can succeed in school. Enjoy your success at college!", "NTA. If they want you to constrain your brother, then you have to have authority over him. They refuse to help with that. They believe they can dictate your actions without in turn being dictated by you, and this is simply tyranny on a familial level.\n\nFililal piety goes both ways and they have failed their duty to both you and your brother by refusing to help you constrain your brothers excesses and foibles and then failing to chastise him now that you have decided to be free of his rampant fun-having that has disrupted both of your lives.\n\nFuthermore, they seem to have no idea what the situation on the ground was and did not trust your judgment. Baffling.", "NTA. Your parents are, though. You asked them repeatedly to help you curb your brothers partying. They blew you off & gaslighted you. So, you found a better living situation & moved out. You are not your brother's keeper, nor are you responsible for what he does. Besides, what makes them think that he will behave if you move back in? He didn't listen to you before. While it's a shame that they might lose money on the condo, they have no one but themselves to blame.", "NTA\n\nYour brother has entitlement issues and your parents are likely a contributing factor.\n\nTime to learn that actions have consequences.\n\nIt's a much easier concept to learn if you don't wait till adulthood to learn it.", "NTA - you aren\u2019t his parent and you tried but were asked to be in control without being given any ability to control. It was your parents choice how to do this so nothing to do with you.", "Depending on where you live, the \"crappy housing market\" might be bullshit they made up to guilt you. There's a housing shortage in a lot of areas in North America (US and Canada are what I'm personally familiar with) and available properties are on the market for MAYBE a week before they sell, if they even make it to market at all.

Apparently your parents think that you would be willing to help 'control' your brother and it is obvious whom they favor. Keep doing what you need to do to succeed. Eventually they will realize that your Brother is either responsible for himself or they will continue to view you as 'uncaring'. Either way, go LC and watch out for yourself.", "NTA instead of letting you set reasonable restrictions like no parties, they are letting the police deal with your brother instead.

If they want him to stay in school, get good grades AND stop all the partying it is up to them to dictate rules.\n\nYou are in no way responsible for his actions and it is not your job to parent your brother.

If you're expected to \"look out for him\" with no power to tell him no, it's pointless. He can sink or swim, just as you have.\n\nI hope for the best for him, but being in a position where you're expected to \"be in charge\" with no actual power is setting you both up for a ruined relationship, if you ever had one.", "NtAH - your brother and your parents are though.

Again, yes, that is assuming that OP's telling of the story is accurate, but it's the reasonable inference anyone would make if so. \n\nAnd again, this still isn't a livable situation for her because the brother is literally holding giant parties that are being shut down by cops and the parents refuse to let her do anything about it. I don't know if you've ever been a busy college student, but being asked to watch out for ANOTHER person's academic performance is never a reasonable expectation.", "That's irrelevant. It doesn't matter that she might have initially not wanted him to move in.
