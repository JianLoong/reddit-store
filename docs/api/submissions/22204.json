I could go to bed in 10 minutes \"and shouldn't start a discussion over 10-15 minutes\".We slept really bad that night, it was warm, there were a shitload of mosquitoes, the bed is really small (1,9m on 1,2m), etc.\n\nThe next morning he had to wake up to go to uni, while I wanted to sleep a bit longer so would be well slept to write my thesis. He sets his alarm clock, stays in bed for 15min scrolling his phone, then gets into the shower, comes back and opens up the curtains all the way and took half an hour to gather all his stuff \"because he wasn't unpacked yet and didn't know where his stuff was\".I got annoyed because he opened to curtains all the way (he could have just opened them enough to be able to see) and took so long.\n\nI told him to be quick and leave the room, so I could continue sleeping. He says that that's unreasonable and that I should stop being so sensitive/controlling about sleep. I need more sleep than he does (8-9 hours vs. 7) and I don't feel like he respects that (eg. Setting alarms, taking a long time to go to bed, staying in the room for almost an hour in the morning, leaving/turning on the light, etc). He tells me I dictate when he should go to bed, while I feel like I only ask him to create an environment I which I can comfortably sleep.\n\nWe've had discussions like this for a year now and this morning I told him he's insensitive to other people's sleep and that I  wish he would grow up and get some empathy. He doesn't seem to understand where I come from and fired these statements back to me.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling him that he's insensitive and asking him to get out the room quickly\n\n\\- To be fair, I am a really light sleeper. It is hard for me to fall asleep/stay asleep with even a little bit of light/noise. So I might be pretty annoying. However I understand that he needs some time to wake up.

This may seem like an extreme position for such a \"minor\" thing, but when one person does not respect the other's boundaries and is not sensitive to the other's needs, then it is time to call off the relationship.  Things are not going to magically get better; it is far more likely they will get worse.  He is not going to suddenly develop empathy.  Better to end things now, when the matter is still small than wait until you are married, have a joint banking account, kids, and you realize that his behavior has made you fall out of love with him, but leaving would be far more complicated.", "Sounds like he needs to read in a different room. Sounds like you guys need a small lamp. Sounds like you guys need to unpack. Sounds like you guys need to work together to come up with sleeping arrangements that work for both of you.

Especially not in a student flat, where you just share a room. How long have you been together?", "NTA because he did not need to open the curtains all the way and his responses to you sound asshole-ish like he is unwilling to compromise. Sitting in bed to scroll the phone isn\u00b4t necessary if you have another room where he could sit. But if it is only one room then it is normal for lots of people to scroll a bit in the morning as well as read before bed at night. \n\nIf you are living in a small flat you are going to get disturbed though, you cannot expect him to tiptoe around while you are sleeping longer than him. So you need to set up bedside lamp for him as well as an eye mask for you to sleep in and earplugs if sound keeps you from sleeping.", "Any time someone tells you to \u201cstop being so sensitive\u201c, tell them to GF themselves. NTA", "NTA. Y\u2019all need to sit down, have a grown conversation, and come to an agreed upon compromise.

Doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re having issues, or that you\u2019re mad, it just works better for a lot of people to have your own spaces where you don\u2019t bother each other when you need time alone, and where you don\u2019t have to compromise on your needs to suit the other person.\n\nIf both of you can\u2019t sit down and have that conversation and make compromises in both of your needs, not just you giving in to his needs or him giving in to yours, without yelling or calling names, it\u2019s a problem with communication and follow through that\u2019s deeper than just disagreeing on bedtime routines.", "NTA.\n\nYou are ready to find a middle ground, he isn't.

That is not a balanced relationship at all. \nHe sounds pretty lame in how he treats you, and I hope that you find in yourself that you truly do not deserve to be treated in such a way. \n\nA relationship should be about caring for each other, not you just taking care of his needs and your own and him just leaning back and doing whatever.

I sleep light and as i am a living entity i also need rest and sleep. If im having a rough night, i sleep elsewhere. Solves the issue and everyone is happy. If he thinks that that is not a good enough compromise, then he needs to start organising his day the night before. \n\nThis to me seems like weaponised incompetence. It seems he wants you to bend to his way of doing things without a thought for yours. Its a narcissistic trait, but doesnt necessarily mean you boyfriend is a narcissist, its just he values his wellbeing and schedule over yours, and will gaslight when you bring it up. \n\nIts fixable, but id say you should always go into these things understanding that young men can have an inflated ego at that age, and he many not realise hes even doing it.", "NTA.

You have different needs for sleep. Going to bed just to stare at the dark is hell too.", "EAh. You both are the As. Both of you don't know how to sleep with someone else. You're the A for expecting him to do things your way because since you can do it, it shouldn't be that hard. I think it's wonderful you are able to fall asleep quickly. I can do that on some nights. I must be tired to zonk out as soon as my head touches the pillow and some other nights I can lay in the dark in silence and not be able to fall asleep. It takes a bit to fall asleep. It's not easy when you can't. My husband winds down in bed. He'd watch or read things on his phone or even turn on the TV to watch an episode etc and i learned not to let it bother me because realistically once I fall asleep, im out. I'll also add I struggle to fall back to sleep if I'm awaken so I get it. My husband also snores so yeah. But I love him and I respect his own process. As for mornings, I'm one that needs to linger in bed. I'll even put my alarm 30 minutes before I need to wake up so I can wake up before needing to actually get up. I'm more irritated when I have to jump out of bed and I found this method to be helpful for me. Slow wake up. I will lay in bed, scrolling thru my things, reading, catching up on my day etc. But I won't play any videos out of consideration for my husband still sleeping. And cue in where your bf is also an A. He should be mindful of continuing to create a space for you to continue sleeping with less interruptions. He shouldn't be opening the curtains. He shouldn't be watching videos in the morning to create more noise. You both share a space. You both need to learn how to compromise. Since it's a recent situation, find a routine. If he needs to wake up earlier than you, then the night before he should get his things put together so it's easier to access. Learn and communicate and compromise! This situation alone doesn't show he is controlling, more so you than him but truly, you both are in the wrong. Learning to live with someone takes time. And if something is a deal breaker then so be it. End the relationship if it's something you'd rather die on than compromise with.

Seems like he doesn't care about the harmful effects his behaviour has on you.", "Lots of married people sleep in different rooms. I know a lot of people who do that.", "So what? When she sleeps he should lay there in darkness and silence?! Absurd", "I know that now, and if it works for them/their relationship, I clearly see the benefits. And it has helped us have less of these fights (when possible to sleep appart). However it does make me feel disconnected and somewhat lonely (?). So I don't know if this is something I see myself doing long-term.", "She mentioned the main light. Would be curious if a small lamp or reading light was considered. In the morning, was a smaller light an option instead of curtains wide open/ lights all on? Also a sleep mask for OP can be helpful- it won\u2019t address a fully lit up room, but those could be some compromises for both of them if he reduces high light usage and she adds some supports for herself to reduce light exposure.\n\nHowever, ultimately they seem incompatible for sharing a room and bed.", "There was no problem with a side light but she was not \u2018allowed\u2019 to turn the main light off."]}
