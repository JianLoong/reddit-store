If this is the case buy a door wedge. Normally they are to keep doors open in the wind, but in this case you can use it to keep the door closed when you are inside. \n\nOther than that, it's probably just best to spend your time as far away from him as you can until your father comes home. Hang out with friends after school till late and then go in your room and keep the door firmly blocked from inside. \n\nI hope this is nothing and you are overreacting, but its better to be safe than sorry.", "It is horrible to be afraid in your own home.

If you\u2019re worried this isn\u2019t an option you can buy a strong wedge shaped doorstop to put under your door at night- portable and easily removed. I would also recommend keeping a loud whistle within reach under your pillow. That way if he does manage to get in you can alert everyone in the house. It\u2019s disturbing that your mum is disregarding your safety concerns, perhaps sending her some information regarding Andrew Tate and seeing if it resonates with either of you may help.

If it's not - lock your bedroom door at night and tell your father as soon as he gets back.\n\nIt may be that your brother has started down a dark road online or that he's suffering from some kind of mental illness (or drugs). No matter what it is, he needs to be helped and you need to feel safe in your own home. \n\nNTA and lock that door, keep your valuables somewhere safe and have a serious sitdown with both your parents when your father returns.", "NTA\n\n>When I do rise to his baiting\n\nIm confused what this term means?\n\nYou can't be an AH for being scared but maybe ask for a lock on your door for privacy reasons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
