I would also recommend keeping a loud whistle within reach under your pillow. That way if he does manage to get in you can alert everyone in the house.

But two things I can think of right now: your brother either wants to hurt you OR he wants you to hurt him. The comment about you being legally an adult is super suspicious to me. It\u2019s like he wants you to get angry and physically engage with him so he can call the police on you, or maybe use \u201cself defense\u201d but in turn hurt you with a valid excuse when accused. \n\n\nDefinitely get a lock, maybe even a camera for your room.

If your mum won't let you get a lock get a door wedge like many others suggested so that you can feel safe while you are in the room.

Your best bet is to ignore everything and anything your brother says or does to push your buttons. Ask your father for permission to change your bedroom door knob to one that locks with the key.
