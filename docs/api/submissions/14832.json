Your son's mother doesn't care that the party is for *him*, she cannot see anything beyond what she wants.\n\nYou do not need your ex's permission to invite Chris to your son's birthday.  It's a party for him, not for your ex.   And you did your part by *informing* her before the party so she wouldn't be blindsided at the party.   That was you being considerate of her feelings; which is much more than she accords her own son.", "INFO: what does Austin want?  To see Chris at his party, or not?", "NTA - I understand the mom's point-of-view, but just because I understand doesn't mean I agree with it. She introduced stepdad into the family, they all bonded, and now she wants to sever that bond shared between the son and the stepdad. She initiated the relationship, but that bond doesn't belong to her. She's kind of monstrous if you think about it.", "Info:  will she be at the party?", "Your son's feelings matter more than your ex-wife's.

Maybe there was more to the divorce than let on\u2026.", "Listen bro, fuck her and her bullshit. You did the right thing inviting him because it obviously means a lot to both him and your son. Moreover, your son shouldn't be punished because his mom's relationship didn't work out. Ask Austin what he wants and go from there but at the very least, that man did right by your son, do right by him. NTA", "NTA.

I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s healthy for kids to have to deal with that separation immediately (my parents - mom & stepdad - divorced and it fucked me up worse than my actual parents divorce).", "Soft YTA. I recognise the good intentions behind the gesture, but you bungled the execution. You should\u2019ve asked your wife first before you talked to Chris and Austin. When she refused, you could ask why and explain how Austin missed him and wanted to see him. You might\u2019ve been able to persuade her to relent. Now, she\u2019ll be more adamant to refuse because she feels you\u2019ve crossed the line. I feel sorry for Austin and Chris. They will be very very disappointed. \n\nBTW, I\u2019m not saying your wife is correct either. She is wrong in preventing Chris and Austin to have a relationship, but unfortunately because Austin is not Chris\u2019 dad, there is nothing he can do about it. When Chris is older, hopefully he can reconnect and they can have a good relationship despite his mom\u2019s objections.", "I mean...you never know what goes on in a marriage.

You should have discussed this with your son\u2019s mom before extending the invitation to Chris.", "ETA to a certain extent.

Otherwise, mom has no real say. Even though he is not the real father, he was with the child for 4 years which is a lot and if he and his stepson have a good bond, it should make no difference and mum should be the adult and put aside any issues she personally has with 'Chris' for the benefit of her son.

However, I'm not sure of your co-parenting situation, but you might want to consider if this is a hill to die on with your ex.
