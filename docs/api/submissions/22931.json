My in-laws were also invited to this wedding; which includes his parents, his two sisters and their husband/boyfriend. \n\nThey were all throwing around ideas of staying in the same accommodation together. I\u2019m not very close with them, as even though I lived with them for a short while, I had to move out again because I was constantly having my privacy and personal boundaries violated; e.g. closed door being opened while I was getting changed, coming into the bathroom while I was in the shower (had no idea that the lock didn\u2019t actually work), going through my personal belongings, etc.\n\nI told my fianc\u00e9 that I wasn\u2019t comfortable staying with them, because it meant a full weekend where I would feel anxious about what would happen and by the look of the house that we were going to stay at, I wasn\u2019t sure there were even going to be enough rooms. The last time that we stayed in an accommodation with them and there weren\u2019t enough rooms, we ended up on a blowup mattress in the living room.\n\nI booked us a seperate room and told him that I would feel more comfortable with that arrangement. He agreed and I thought that was the last of that. \n\nCome to today, he called me to tell me that his sister was asking for our share of payment for the house. I was confused and reminded him we were staying somewhere else. He told me that his sister booked it after I had booked ours and he hadn\u2019t told her that we were staying somewhere else. I said that he would have to tell his sister that and they would have to work out the rest of the payment amongst themselves because I wasn\u2019t going to cancel our booking. He said that I would have to call her and explain, because he wasn\u2019t going to be defending us to them anymore. \n\nI hung up on him and have been ignoring his calls since.

Ditch him.", "Well, he's giving you a pretty clear idea of what the rest of your life is going to be like if you go through with this marriage. His failure to communicate with his family doesn't have to be your problem. Cancel your reservation, tell him to have fun with his family, and think very carefully about your future.\n\nNTA.", "NTA: your fianc\u00e9 is the asshole. This is 100% his fault for not telling them. It\u2019s ridiculous that he expects you to call and explain it. It\u2019s also not fair to your family members that they counted on you paying your share because he didn\u2019t bother to tell them: frankly, he should pay it from his personal funds if you two don\u2019t have joint finances.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9e is, though. He failed to communicate with his family about the bookings, and now he wants you to clean up his mess.\n\nHe should be dealing with his family when there's problems like this. Did they ever check with him on committing? Did he ever tell them yes or no?\n\nIf they never checked with him for a commitment, then it's on them to cover. If he led them to believe that you were joining the rest of the family, then it's on him to cover-- unless you guys were just going to be on an air mattress.  That's just wrong.", "NTA but your fiance is. He isnt' having your back on this despite his family violating your privacy and your belongings. I would never sleep in the same accommodation as these people ever again!\n\nHe wants you to take the blame for this when in my view he should understand that his family's behaviour was really inappropriate. It sounds like the onus would be on him to tell HIS family that you two will not be joining their accommodation. Or, you know what, just tell your fiance he is more than welcome to join his family's accommodation and share in their costs if that makes him happy but that you will stay in your booked room.\n\nIt's one thing for your own parents or siblings to snoop or walk in on you taking a shower. It's another thing entirely when someone else's family does that even if they are your in laws. Ask him how he would feel if your mother deliberately walked in on him having a shower or if your father would snoop through his personal belongings.", "Nope right out of that OP. He manages the relationship with his family not you. You owe them no explanation. If your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t deal with this appropriately, what does your future look like with him and his family? Something you want to sign up to a lifetime of?\n\nNTA", "NTA He should have informed them so he should deal with it. It's also his family. If he's \"fed up\" I question his marriage compatibility/capability to be a good husband. He should have spoke up in the last situation and sounds like he didn't.\n\nAlso think about if you do get married and have kids now your kids will have to deal with creepy and weird in laws if you husband won't be sticking up for your family.", "Good for you for hanging up on him. This is his mess to clean up, not yours. NTA", "NTA. You never agreed to this. He can pay the share and stay with them.\n\nEdit to add: boyfriend is a double AH if he doesn't take care of this right away. His sister might be able to cancel and book somewhere else if he doesn't draw this out.", "'Former' BF is an ass...and a spineless ass at that.  Really frustrates me when I see other guys act childishly around or with their significant others.  I've made my fair share of mistakes but nothing like this.

Don't ignore them.", "NTA\u2014neither is you fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister because she booked the property believing you were staying with her. This is your fianc\u00e9\u2019s fault. He should have told his family you were staying elsewhere. And his telling you to handle the problem he created is the cherry on top of the sundae. Wow!", "NTA but you married a wimp. The cardinal rule of marriage is that each person handles their own family.\n\nWhen you finally talk to him, explain that this is his mess to clean up and if he insists on acting like a child, you'll have to be brutally honest with his family about neither of you wanting to spend time with any of them, you two had agreed, and they raised a wimp.", "NTA. Call his sister and tell her that you booked a separate hotel before she booked the house. Her brother said he would tell her and apparently didn't. You could also explain to her that he is too cowardly to tell her this himself and requested you do it.\n\nThen stand back and watch the fireworks. You probably won't end up going to the wedding but do you really care?", "NTA. Your man is throwing you under the bus. This pattern of behavior will repeat as long as you are with him\n\nThe good news here is that he's your fianc\u00e9 not your husband. Plan accordingly.", "NTA\n\nYour Fiance can pay his half of the room you booked and whatever he wants to his family for their accomodations... And then he can sleep on an air mattress in his family's accomodations for this wedding.", "NTA either ditch the man and get a refund if any money spent and if not possible enjoy your mini vacation by finding fun activities in the area.", "Tell him to pay it on his own and he can go stay with them.  U will be in your own lodgings where u can have respect and privacy.  NtAH but he is.  He made the mess, he needs to deal with it.  He did not forget to mention it. He straight up decided he could manipulate you into caving and going along.", "NTA, tell your fiance to either go no contact or grow a spine.", "NTA -- I assume that your fiance told his sister that you guys booked a separate room as soon you did.", "NTA, he needs to man up", "NTA and absolutely not your responsibility to inform HIS family about your plans.\n\nAlso, this is something you really need to nip in bud right now.  You need a come to Jesus meeting with your fianc\u00e9 about how he HAS to have your back and any and all battles with his family are his to take.  Else, you may end up with a lifetime of your partner rolling over for his family and expecting you to always fight the battles and be the bad guy.  Not a fun place to be.", "NTA, but this sure sounds deliberate. Perhaps I'm reading too much into this, but it's very convenient that your fiance \"forgot\" to tell his sister you had booked your own room.\n\nThis sounds like it was set up to keep him from being blamed: by you, for forcing you into accommodations you're not comfortable, and by his family, for pulling out of their arrangement. So instead he has cast you as each others' villains. To you, he can say \"whoops I forgot, but we *have* to give sis the money or everyone will hate us.\" To his family he can say \"I didn't know she did this, of course I want to stay with you but I have to make her happy.\" You and the in-laws are mad at each other, and he's the only winner here.\n\nOf course it's quite possible he's just forgetful - I know I am - but the way he threw you under the bus because he didn't want to \"defend you to them anymore\" makes me think otherwise. Ask yourself why you want to spend time with someone who is quite comfortable with his family hating you for things that are not your fault.", "This is a time your fiance is showing their true colors.\n\nThey have said that the were not going to defend a joint decision to the family and that your had to do it.  it isNOT your job to defend this decision to HIS family. It is HIS job.\n\nYou are right to draw this boundary.\n\nNTA", "NTA pay attention to how your fianc\u00e9 deals with you and his family. It certainly won\u2019t get better", "You left it to him to explain to his family and he was too cowardly to do it\n\nNTA", "NTA for booking, but phone his sister\u2026 you\u2019re already the bad guys in their eyes\u2026 what\u2019s one more thing", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
