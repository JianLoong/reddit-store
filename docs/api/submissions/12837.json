When she came over, she took a couple of bites and said that she didn't understand why I spent so much time and money on it because it tasted EXACTLY like the lasagna she would make with canned Panzani bolognese sauce and boxed pasta sheets (not similar, not kinda like, but EXACTLY like it). My feelings were a lil hurt ngl, but I understand that to each their tastes and I just told her I'm sorry she didn't like it that much and then kept it pushing and suggested we watch a movie.\n\nFlashforward to yesterday, she was coming over for dinner and I asked her what she wanted to eat and she said \"lasagna\". So I popped over to the store and got panzani sauce and pasta sheets to make it because A)- She said my lasagna and the quick made one tasted the exact same, so no need to spend a lot on ingredients and B)- Because even if I had wanted to make my recipe, I wouldn't have the time since it takes me an entire afternoon, which is why it's a special occasions thing. So she showed up at my house, took one bite of the lasagna and then spat it out and said that it tastes different. When I told her I made it how she did, she got really upset at me and said that I wasn't putting in effort and that she was expecting to have a real meal and not something cheap. I pointed out the comments she made last time, and she rolled her eyes and said she was clearly exagerating. So then I got upset because wth?\n\nThe situation got brought up to our mutual friends, most have stayed out of it but two of them think I'm the asshole because my gf clearly meant she wanted my \"special\" lasagna which is why she asked for it as dinner, and that I should have let her known before hand that I was going to make one using premade sauce etc... I think it was clear that that's what I was gonna do cause she literally asked for lasagna 2 hours before coming over, which is not enough time to make the \"special\" one even if I wanted to. AITA ?\n\nTo clarify, the \"cheap\" lasagna tasted just fine, pretty tasty even! Just not at all comparable to the original one, in my opinion.", "created_utc": 1679413163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xkj0v/aita_for_making_my_girlfriend_cheap_lasagna/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ive been crafting a chili recipe for a while now that I'm very proud of, and similarly it's an all-day procedure (even though most of that time is fucking around while the pot simmers untouched), and if someone tried my chili and told me it tasted just like the chili they make at home with just ground beef and a couple jars of spaghetti sauce I'd be pretty upset too. \n\nBut that kind of comment also just sends a couple signals, such as \"your effort doesn't mean too much to me\" and \"I don't mind cheap or easy food\" and so yeah, I would also trim down my level of efforts for that person.\n\nI'd only note that even though it should have been obvious to her, it would have helped your case if you had sent her a message clarifying that you'd make the cheap easy one since you didn't have time now for your special recipe, but imo, she still had some pretty rude reactions to you at both instances so still NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe wants to diminish your effort and the resulting recipe, then she's lucky she got lasagne at all, let alone quick-made. \n\nPeople like this chap my ass.
