So she showed up at my house, took one bite of the lasagna and then spat it out and said that it tastes different. When I told her I made it how she did, she got really upset at me and said that I wasn't putting in effort and that she was expecting to have a real meal and not something cheap.

I think it was clear that that's what I was gonna do cause she literally asked for lasagna 2 hours before coming over, which is not enough time to make the \"special\" one even if I wanted to.

Make a little space in the middle of the pan and fry the tomato paste in that space then mix it with everything and add the passata, bouquet garni, and salt, pepper, chilli flakes and spanish smoked paprika to taste.

Either way she's trying to keep you insecure. The \"jokes\" are a way to create an imbalance of power in the relationship, because she doesn't want you to realize you can do better.
