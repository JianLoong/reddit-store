When she came over, she took a couple of bites and said that she didn't understand why I spent so much time and money on it because it tasted EXACTLY like the lasagna she would make with canned Panzani bolognese sauce and boxed pasta sheets (not similar, not kinda like, but EXACTLY like it). My feelings were a lil hurt ngl, but I understand that to each their tastes and I just told her I'm sorry she didn't like it that much and then kept it pushing and suggested we watch a movie.\n\nFlashforward to yesterday, she was coming over for dinner and I asked her what she wanted to eat and she said \"lasagna\". So I popped over to the store and got panzani sauce and pasta sheets to make it because A)- She said my lasagna and the quick made one tasted the exact same, so no need to spend a lot on ingredients and B)- Because even if I had wanted to make my recipe, I wouldn't have the time since it takes me an entire afternoon, which is why it's a special occasions thing. So she showed up at my house, took one bite of the lasagna and then spat it out and said that it tastes different. When I told her I made it how she did, she got really upset at me and said that I wasn't putting in effort and that she was expecting to have a real meal and not something cheap. I pointed out the comments she made last time, and she rolled her eyes and said she was clearly exagerating. So then I got upset because wth?\n\nThe situation got brought up to our mutual friends, most have stayed out of it but two of them think I'm the asshole because my gf clearly meant she wanted my \"special\" lasagna which is why she asked for it as dinner, and that I should have let her known before hand that I was going to make one using premade sauce etc... I think it was clear that that's what I was gonna do cause she literally asked for lasagna 2 hours before coming over, which is not enough time to make the \"special\" one even if I wanted to. AITA ?\n\nTo clarify, the \"cheap\" lasagna tasted just fine, pretty tasty even!

I think tone and subject matter are really important to distinguish the two. You don\u2019t poke fun of a dish your partner worked hard on. \n\nAnd if you verbalize that the joke hurt you and the response is any variation of \u201cyou\u2019re being too sensitive\u201d \u201cI clearly didn\u2019t mean it that way\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry *you* took it like that\u201d, there\u2019s a 99.9999% chance it\u2019s negging. \n\nBottom line, if it makes you feel criticized and like your partner is taking a shot at you rather than making you laugh and feel like your partner is laughing with you, it\u2019s not affectionate, it\u2019s not lighthearted, and you don\u2019t need to put up with it.", "I affectionately tease my husband all the time.\n\nThe difference is I might crack a joke while he is cooking but I also compliment him. So I might make fun of him for spending half of the day cooking but then once I eat I would say \"holy shit I get it now this is amazeballs\".\n\nAnd that's probably a bad example because I generally don't make fun of anyone willing to cook for me because I hate cooking. I just know that we rag on each other all of the time that's just the nature of our relationship. But then we get serious and sappy and tell each other how much we actually love each other... it's quite gross really", "Didn\u2019t notice, thanks.", "May her noodles always be mushy. \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffb", "\u201cAnd [her] marinara sauce never cling to [her] pasta!\u201d - Golden Girls", "I respect your experience. My locust friends never allowed this to happen.", "When I'm simmering the meat sauce it's after I've added the 800 ml of passata, which is the tomato sauce.", "And with your spirit.", "His noodley appendage be upon you.", "Thank you for this, it explains it really well. I'm not very attractive, I've known that for a long time and made my peace with it it doesn't really bother me most of the time since it's just my objective reality; however my gf (well ex-gf soon I think), would always make jokes or remarks that she wasn't with me for my looks, but for my personality, or my sense of humour, even when the situation doesn't call for that type of remark at all. She'd always rectify it with an assurance that she was just joking, but there was sometimes the feeling that she was making a joke at my expense, and not joking with me. I just wanted to thank you for the comment, this has been a real \"come to jesus\" moment for me. I know it's embarassing but this is my first relationship and she is quite frankly out of my league so I thought that that was the price I had to pay and that it was all in good fun.", "I'm down for any lasagna, special or cheap.", "May her mince be full of gristle", "That\u2019s fair. I cook for myself frequently so it\u2019s not uncommon for me to make a large tray and then freeze portions after it\u2019s cooked to reheat later.", "Ah, I didn't know what passata was. Thanks for the clarification", "You misspelled shirt, that's where the sauce normally winds up", "Oh, it is.", "Dude. She's out with no apologies. Plus I'll make lasagna tonight. Cheers!", "She\u2019s not out of your league.   \n\nYour lasagna is out of her league.   \n\nTime to go!", "Are we organizing a lasagna party?", "May her pesto always be bland and oily"]}
