She needs to make a commitment to being in the kids lives first.  She's being very selfish. She should go stay with her parents, but she knows they'll tell her the truth and she doesn't want to hear it.", "NTA and you absolutely don't need to be propping up her bad decisions. It's not fair on the kids, but it's also not fair on you.", "NTA.. she is no longer a mum to the kids her actions completely rule out that title.  Don't know the age of the kids but You need to break it to the kids why she left in the first place..", "NTA, \n\nIt is best she doesn't come to your house for the sake of kids.\n\nYour parents and new gf are kind enough understand and accommodate, which is good, however the ex-wife  would be an intruder and there will be disruption. And you have to keep on giving....", "NTA - it\u2019s not fair on you or your children. You don\u2019t owe your ex anything. She chose this life and this is part of it. \n\nShe is not homeless, she had options.  She might not like those options, but she has them. \n\nEven if she was homeless, it still would not be fair on your children to let her back in the family home.", "NTA - like so many others have said protect the mental well-being of your children.", "NTA. Let her stay with your parents. You don't owe her anything.", "Hell no.  She walked away, she can stay the hell away. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. You had good boundaries not to let her stay. I see it as becoming a long term thing and not appropriate at all.  Ok to keep the dogs IF you want to. Kids will enjoy.  Also ok to not keep the dogs. She can finance her \u201cweek or two\u201d herself.  She can figure out her own life herself.  She can stay with her parents even with the criticism.  She is not without options.  Your parents are wrong, just don\u2019t talk to them about it.   Btw she treats you and the kids like crap (still) and calls you names if you won\u2019t bail her out of the consequences of her own choices.  You have been decent to her in the divorce and not criticizing her to the kids.  Don\u2019t let her stay.  Hold firm.", "Definitely don't let her stay she abandoned them and ran off chasing a dream that did not exist. She's the bad guy you owe her nothing,she made her choice so can't come crying back when things get tough", "NTA Thank you for protecting your kids.", "NTA\nShe either interacts with the kids then leaves or ignores them altogether this is your main priority as a parent she made her choice and now has to live with it.", "NTA \n\nShe made her choice, it was all settled and if you don't want to go back to the previous situation then that's not your problem. \nOffering to take in her dogs in to give her more options is the opposite of AH", "NTA. She can stay at a hotel, you seem like a great dad.", "NTA. As someone who's lived in vans and cars for several years, part of this lifestyle is about the maintenance and failures, and having to sort yourself out around those. She has support available to her that she's not taking. It's entirely more appropriate for her to stay with her parents than with you, and it's entirely appropriate they criticise her the entire time for it. Or she can find a hostel or a campsite, like everyone else does when the van's in the shop for a few days. She already has options and you have no obligation to provide another.\n\nYou and those kids deserve to be respected and to not be taken for granted. She can't opt in and out when it suits her. Boundaries.", "Nta op she chose to leave she chose to sell her portion of the house to you she chose van life she chose not to visit her children this is all on her head          \n\nyour a much nicer person than i am id personally tell her that im not her safety net she made her decisions i moved on from her crap and im with someone else so she better learn to sort her own shit out from now on", "NTA. And thank you for caring for the dogs. It\u2019s not their fault she is an asshole! \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, to be honest your justification alone is valid, if she hasnt shown any interest in the kids and has barely spoken to you, then you have to move on (seems like you are)... You aren't there as a lifeboat to someone who decided to leave YOU. She HAS options, she still has parents... It might be different if you were leaving her ACTUALLY homeless. \n\nA little surprised your parents would challenge you on this if you have a new partner, they must know the whole situation and the pressure this would put on a new relationship?", "NTA.  Reap what you sow, van-lady!", "Nta, please do not do this! My parents had an on again Off again period before they divorced, and it traumatized me!", "Please don\u2019t lie to your kids about why their mother isn\u2019t around. My mother did that toward why my father wasn\u2019t around and it really invalidated what I was feeling. \n\nYears after, and confronting my mother about why she did lie. She now is truly sorry she did and understands what a huge mistake it was.", "NTA. Do not let her stay with you! She abandoned you and her own flesh and blood. What kind of woman does that?  Also, the woman that\u2019s you\u2019re seeing says she would understand letting your ex stay there but for the same of your new relationship, I\u2019d tread really carefully about letting your ex stay there. Your ex lost all rights to criticize you when she walked out on you and the kids. Let her stay in a hotel, let her use her money to pay for it. She didn\u2019t give too much consideration for you and the children.", "You\u2019re a great dad. Keep on putting their needs first.", "NTA\n\nI totally get your logic, and very likely would have had the same instinct, depending on the kids.\n\nFWIW, mine never mattered where dad stayed, they always had a serious crashout when he left again. Expect it, and hug them, and make sure they know it's totally normal to feel sad when someone you love isn't around much.", "NTA for eons. Double-good on you for keeping your kids safe from more trauma *and* for giving her dogs maybe the most stable and relaxing time they\u2019ve ever had. \n\nMy stepdad has a friend that also saw Nomadworld or whatever that \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool to shit in a bucket for the rest of your twilight years and wander around dirt\u201d movie was, and he let him crash at the house so he could \u201cmake some repairs to the van\u201d. After 4 months of his friend \u201cworking on the van\u201d, stepdad told mom he needed to stay for \u201canother year or so\u201d. Poof. Gone. Smartest thing mom ever did. \n\nYour ex was *not* going to make it a \u201cquick stay\u201d with you. You\u2019re saving your kids from some serious disappointment.", "NTA", "NTA, your ex FAFO'd and needs to grow up. \n\nShe has a home, her van.\n\nShe cares more for the dogs than her kids apparently, if she can't be back more than once every few years.", "NTA", "Hell no! You're NTA. Shae made her bed and can now lie in it, she wants her freedom and the benefits and security that came with her family unit. Sucks to suck.", "NO NO NO NTA. She can not stay. She\u2019s heartless", "NTA.  Your kids are your only priority, not the mother who started a new life.  Vanlife means you're going to be hot.  She can figure it out.", "NTA. You're not leaving her without options. She can go to her parents. She made her choices and she needs to deal with the consequences, whether it's not having a place to stay because she chose to live in a van or having to put up with the judgement from her parents.", "Amen, on point, NTA. Stay right there in that lane, you're absolutely correct. \ud83d\udcaf", "Nta it would definitely be hard for the kids when she left again in a week. She also has a place to stay with her parents. If she chooses not to stay with them because it's awkward for her then that's her problem and her choice.", "NTA at all. It would cause the kids such heartache when she left the house again. You\u2019re looking after your kids, NTA at all for that", "I think the reason she is pushing ex-hubby is that he seems to have \u2018accepted\u2019 the situation, whereas her parents have not.  And op will most likely NOT fight in front of the kids or do anything to upset THEM, whereas it won\u2019t be that peaceful at her parents.\n\nOP = silence, free lodging and food, and getting to play mommy before getting back to her wonderlife.\n\nParents = judgement and probably uncomfortable arguments.", "Also, what happens if she chooses to post her kids to the influencer sites she uses.  Kids always sell, and as a mom, she can post her kids with no legal issues.", "As a child who\u2019s dad kept going in and out of my life yeah every time I\u2019d see him I\u2019d be happy and then i won\u2019t see him again for weeks or months. It hurt badly as a child and learned harshly growing up realizing my dad didn\u2019t like me or love me he was about wanting a son. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m in NC with of my parents cuz they\u2019re just such terrible ppl in the end.", "happylukie nailed it.  And taking the dogs proves what a great guy you are.", "Not to mention, OP is seeing someone else.  If the ex stays, gets the kids' hopes up, then leaves, will the kids blame the new girlfriend, even if she has nothing to do with it?\n\nOP needs to let the ex grow up and deal with her problems on her own.  All of the growth and peace he and his kids have worked towards will be undone if he caters to that ridiculous woman he was married to.\n\nAlso off topic, but everyone hates influencers.  This silly woman abandoned her children to take a job with very little chance of success and is looked down on by society in general.  What a fool!", "the consequences kicked out the door when they came knocking I guess", "Leaving her family aside, \u201cvan life influencer\u201d sounds like one of the worst kind of influencers imho. Even if I were single and for some type of crazy reason wanted to be an influencer, I cannot imagine not having decent access to a bathroom, shower, good mattress, etc. Maybe I\u2019m old and boring at this point in my life, but yikes. \n\nIf I had to be an influencer now, no one would follow me bc it would be like\u2014\u201cso these are my houseplants, and this is my cupboard of ibuprofen.\u201d", "Damn.... she left them at 2 and 3? Poor kids....\n\nYeah, no! They don't deserve more heartbreak", "How the hell does a parent leave like this!?!?", "Nta stick to your guns here, they are too young to understand.", "If the dogs are fortunate that's what will happen. I cannot imagine dogs thriving with a van life, and I've had dogs almost all my own life.", "Can\u2019t be a van life influencer without a cute dog", "Super true; he should be careful or he will definitely get stuck with the dogs", "i mean once word gets around that she abandoned children for gentrified homelessness, that ends her van life influencer career", "Even if they're old enough the most I'd do is ask their input, but be clear that the decision isn't theirs.  It's not fair to place that burden on the already abandoned child.", "I have seen #vanlife people with cats. That would be even worse than with a dog.\n\nAnd don't get me started on people that do it with kids. .", "They'd need to be tiny tiny dogs.", "She can pick up a newer cuter one at the pound.", "I'd want up to date vax and checkups before taking them in. Gift horses need dental exams despite the proverbs.", "[removed]"]}
