I'm assuming you asked politely and not as part of an argument?\n\nAlso, are you getting help for your anxiety? I think your family should be accommodating to a point (without being enabling).

Especially when change makes you anxious.", "it is a sort of coping mechanism for her which is why i dont mind, if she wants to move the house around she can, i cant stop her. i get im not entitled to her letting me know, but I feel as if I\u2019m being ignored when it comes to her just giving me a heads up. i feel like its not too much of an inconvenience for her to let me know \u201chey im moving the furniture around\u201d which she has done a few times before ( 2-3 times ) but she is constantly moving stuff around and especially with scenery change and the loud noises it makes me anxious.

I hope you get the help you need.", "Your mom sounds like a visual person and that is why she has to move it to see if it works or not. It is also probably a creative outlet so she rearranges as she is inspired to do it.  I understand it gives you anxiety and it can be hard for many to understand why.  Maybe work on some of your coping mechanisms like controlling your breath, focusing on your own space/room, etc.  It is your mom's house and I don't think it is reasonable to ask for advance notice as she probably just does it on the fly when she's inspired to change things.  Instead why not ask your mom to text you AFTER she changes things so if you are out or at school you will know before you walk into the house, etc. Like I moved the sofa from the front wall to opposite the fireplace or some such.", "NTA\n\nthere will be (already are) a few people who get up in arms about it being \"her house\" in the same way certain people will go off on the \"under my roof/my house, my rules\" spiel. but as it is, you are, legally, a child who is obligated to live there (assuming typical family situations ofc). it is not unreasonable in any way to want to be comfortable in your own home. you are not asking she \"ask for permission\" before moving things, just simply inform you when she decides to do it.\n\ni also see a bit of myself and my mom in this post, so i'm going to give you some medical advice - this is based solely off my own experiences and is no way an actual diagnosis (nor am i qualified to do that). maybe consider bringing it up to your doctor/therapist.\n\nit may be related more to your mom's other medical condition, but her going on these household projects feels like bipolar manic episodes - particularly if she tends to abandon projects partway through. my mom is diagnosed bipolar, as are both of her sisters. all three of them will get a harebrained idea, often in the middle of the night, to start changing things and moving furniture around. \n\ni have personally been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i also suspect i may be on the autistic spectrum. i *hate* change, in pretty much every form. i will inevitably adapt, but it certainly causes me stress until then. when you're surrounded by constant change in your surroundings, that stress takes a toll on you.  when i was about your age, i came home from a weekend trip to find my mom had cleaned and rearranged my entire room without telling me. not just changing up the furniture in a communal space, but in my personal one, was absolutely horrible.\n\nthings have worked out well for us. i'm 26 and still live at home with my bipolar mom - both of us finding the right cocktail of meds has done the heavy lifting. learning to communicate and compromise has been pretty damn important too, of course. i had a lot of spats with her at 16/17 - most of that was just growing up, but plenty of it had to do with us being at opposite ends of a mental spectrum - me with depression, her with mania.\n\ni hope this helps!!", "YTA.

You don't gain more value if you were an adult or paying rent. She brought you here, against your will, she should at least allow you to feel comfortable. Bickering about things like this is clutter for your mind and at your age you don't need it. She seems to be moving things out of restlessness and anxiety. She's frustrated she can't get what she truly wants and now she's taking it out on you. She's wrong. You haven't done anything wrong", "I feel like most comments here unhelpful. It sounds like your mom has mental issues as well, I often have an intense urge to reorganize things when I feel I have no control over other aspects of my life. \nIdeally your mom should get therapy to reduce the number if times she moves stuff around. \nAgain, it probably isn't rational, which is also why she gets upset about complaints about it.\n\nI understand this is anxiety-inducing for you, i would find this very annoying; but maybe view it as a mental health thing she can't help and try to be a bit more compassionate / find a way it works for you, for example staying in your room a bit more often when something is new.\n\nI'm sorry if this wasnt helpful and good luck.", "YTA children aren't objects or pets, they're people.

These are lifelong skills that will benefit you in the long run. \n\nI understand your home is your safe space where you shouldn\u2019t have to mask your anxiety, but until you pay rent/a mortgage, that\u2019s currently limited to your bedroom. The good news is, when you do rent or buy, your safe space will be the entire living space. The bad news, the real world will be a lot less forgiving/accommodating to your anxiety than your current home environment.
