Some of the things she\u2019s done has been helpful, however some of it is completely useless. I try to keep an open mind about it in case it turns out to be awesome or helpful.

I had already walked downstairs the day before to her moving the furniture around in the living room which was a little bit of a shocker for me.

I'm assuming you asked politely and not as part of an argument?\n\nAlso, are you getting help for your anxiety? I think your family should be accommodating to a point (without being enabling). However things are always changing so it's beneficial to have the tools to navigate your feelings and stressors about said changes.
