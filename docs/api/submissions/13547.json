My boyfriend (22m) has planned us to get an expensive buffet, a DIY teriyaki place, which I absolutely love. So our plan was just a simple birthday, no parties, no big dinner, just us two spending dinner together and spend the night at a hotel later on. \n\nSo me and my boyf\u2019s mum never really has a good relationship nor a bad one. But one thing I know abt her for sure is that she likes to complain abt me all the time to my boyf, and assumed stuff about me. For instance, when we went out to buy groceries, me and her mum got different stuffs and were planning to pay for our own stuff. When I got home, my bf told me that her mum assumed he had paid all my groceries instead of paying myself. Basically she likes the idea of me being a gold digger. She always complains about how I would spend a lot of his money. And I know for sure that is not true. \n\nThere\u2019s also this one time, where I asked my boyfriend if I could borrow one of his keyboards because mine was broken. He wasn\u2019t going to use them since he is using a laptop. His mum complained and said \u201cWhat if we need for emergency?\u201d. Mind you, the mum doesn\u2019t even use computer. On the other hand, she never sees what I have done to her son at all. When my boyf\u2019s laptop screen broke, I gave him my monitor that I am currently using because I use 2 monitors whenever I use my pc. And idc, but she never noticed it ig.\n\nSo the issue rn is, I was really looking forward for this birthday dinner because i only get to eat at this restaurant once a year since that it is expensive, and I want to spend it with my boyfriend alone. So the dinner was going to be my birthday gift from my bf, which I am very thankful for. When the mum heard of our dinner plan. She kept asking \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask your sister and Lucas (bf sis\u2019s bf), to come along?\u201d \n\nAt first I was ok with this idea until his mum mentioned that my boyf has to pay for everyone. In total it would be around 400 bucks. It might not be much for you, but it is to me. Not only I wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy the food with peace, my boyf has to use his money for their meals. \n\nI told my boyf, if his mother really insisted on his family to come along on MY birthday dinner, I don\u2019t want to go. I just want my birthday to be just the two of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: It\u2019s a teppanyaki place, not terayaki, my bad :/ The reason why the DIY Teppanyaki place is pricy because it\u2019s a buffet. So it\u2019s like a hot pot place. But instead of hot pot, you get the grill. Basically, you get free flow of High quality meat, Australian wagyu and Japanese wagyu. It\u2019s just a buffet, but instead of cooked stuffs, you cook it yourself the way you want it.", "created_utc": 1680168599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126hojd/aita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriends_family_to_come/", "score": 320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with how his mom talks to you. He definitely should have TOLD her that this is his gift to you which more importantly your and his time for a quiet romantic evening with the hotel room to follow. It seems you get this once a year and it's for you and his undivided attention to you.  WTF, is he even telling her! It is private unless he needs to report to her for approval.\n\nAsk him what is more important you or his mother's input on your relationship. I would die on this hill today bc if you give this private time for your birthday what's next, she gets to be in the room while you give birth? If he can't now, he never will.

MILs were born to destroy everything they see. Complai9ni9ng and scheming to them is like breathing to others. But it will limit the harm she can do.\n\nSo when she pushes in with inviting sister and Lucas, BF says, No, *you* invite sister and Lucas if that matters to you. Or when she complains that OP is a gold digge, etc., cut her off for long enough for it to hurt.\n\nUnless he does that, you're always going to have this problem.\n\nBut good for you for holdoing out for a birthday dinner for TWO ONLY.
