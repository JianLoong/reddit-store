Take your friend off, just the two of you, and explain that he will have to trust you enough to confide in you.

Here are my humble contributions, which assume a certain level of daft thinking on his part:\n\nPerhaps he forgot to ask permission from his Parole Officer to leave your state, and the PO has scheduled a visit for 6 pm.\n\nMaybe he bought a lottery ticket that he thinks is a sure winner, and  the numbers will be announced at 6 pm.\n\nMostly I agree with u/UnicornPanties, though.
