When I was in high school (Im 22 now) I had a boyfriend and I found out this girl at our school was sleeping with him while we were together. I hated her so much especially because she talked about me in so many of their messages saying she likes sneaking around with him knowing that he has a girlfriend and constantly asking him if I think anythings suspicious.   \n\n\nImagine my surprise when we graduate and she starts dating my brother. I couldnt believe his betrayal to date someone who did me dirty and didnt speak to him for a while but we were able to reconcile and I even developed a relationship with her after she got pregnant. When she did get pregnant I had my suspicions if my brother was even the father. Not to slutshame but she had a history of being a side chick and promiscuous. I didnt say anything at first until one of my guy friends tells me shes been hooking up with one of his cousins overlapping when she started seeing my brother, he even sent proof.  \n\n\nWhen I showed my brother he told me I was a psycho liar who never liked her and is trying to get them to break up. I told him that its true I dont like her but that doesnt change the fact that I had Tinder screenshots during the beginning of their relationship after they made it official and she cheated. We got into a huge argument where I told him to get a paternity test since the timeline she slept with the other guy would be when she conceived and she told him that he needs to cut me off because Im being toxic during her pregnancy and he did. He asked me to apologize to her so she could let us be cool again so I did to appease him.\n\n   \nRecently it came out that back in late May my brother and her split up and she left the apartment for a few days and when she came back she took their \u201cson\u201d and told my brother its over and proceeded to move into another mans house. They ended up getting back together and she moved back in but come to find out the other man who is the suspected father was the man she had ran away with and then moved in with temporarily and they filed a paternity test for him through the court and he is the father. Once it was established she moved out again and took my \u201cnephew\u201d last week. The other man is now wanting my brother to relinquish rights so he can get on the BC.   \n\n\nMy brother came over to the house and broke down sobbing and told us since he hid everything. I guess her moving in with him again and establishing him as the father through the state was his breaking point. During this he turns me to me and says I should have warned him more and not let her isolate him and I said I did and he says I could have done more and I got upset and said that its his fault since he knew she was unfaithful and cut me off when I told him and its his fault he forced me to be kind to her to have access to him or the baby. He ran out crying and my mom says Im a major asshole and shouldnt have blamed him and kicked him while hes down after he tried to blame ME!", "created_utc": 1690407442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ailp5/aita_for_telling_my_brother_i_told_you_so_after/", "score": 419, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What a shit brother.  Your mother sucks too. \n\nIf he's down,  it's his own damn fault.  He betrayed you, went NC with you, and is now blaming you. Why the hell are you still in contact with him? I'd go NC until he groveled with an apology. \n\nYou could have lit yourself on fire while doing the watusi, and he wouldn't have believed you.", "NTA. Truth hurts, and you were only standing up for yourself. He cannot accept responsibility for his poor judgment and is looking to blame you for it, just like he tried to blame you for bringing the truth to his attention while he was still with her.

He tried to drag you under a bus and you didn't let him.", "NTA. Your mother seems to have it nice and easy here, delegating responsibility to you to do all the sense-talking to your brother and blaming you when you don't give the proper babying. A mother perhaps should put up with your brother's mercurial temperament, but you are NOT responsible for his feelings. Drop your mother's shaming like a bad habit.", "NTA. Your brothers an idiot, has he never heard once a cheat always a cheat he\u2019s got no one to blame but himself", "NTA, he FAFO..... quite literally.", "NTA. At the very least he could have had healthy curiosity and asked for the paternity test when the baby was born. It would have saved him from a whole lot of drama.", "NTA, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA for reasons I went into in another comment. Your brother betrayed you, you tried to help him anyway and he insulted you, then he had the audacity to blame you for not doing more to help him. He's a shitty sibling.", "Nta, your bro was warned, hell you had proof she was a cheater to start with, he chose her coochie over good advice, its on him, at least he wont be stuck paying her to have his kid. He should be thanking you and apologising for dismissal of your warning.", "NTA\n\nYou might want to stop apologizing. You had red-handed picture proof. Stay strong and don't bend. It sounds like you are the only one who is able to help your brother grasp reality.", "NTA. \nYes, you don't kick people who are down already. But you didn't. You just defended yourself after comforting him and being attacked by him more than once. He's sad and heartbroken. But you're not his scapegoat. You were more than patient already.", "NTA. Not sure if you wanna hear the perspective of someone slightly younger than you, but I don\u2019t think what you did was wrong. I think he\u2019s hurting right now and is finding someone else besides Ex to blame. You warned him, and he proceeded. He has to accept the consequences and I hope things get better for him, but you aren\u2019t the a-hole here.", "NTA\n\nI know we amateur judges love to toss this around but he was gaslighting you.\n\nHe dated her knowing what she did to you. You warned him then.\n\nWhen the stakes went up with a baby, you not only told him she was cheating you provided proof.\n\nYou did your part and him rewriting history won't change it.\n\nDid he want you to sky write it?

He should have curbed her when he found out what she did to you.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is hurting and your mom wants to help him, which is understandable if misplaced.

Perhaps your delivery could have been a little softer but you had tried to warn him. He\u2019ll probably calm down when he\u2019s had more time to process the situation.", "NTA, if you had said it out of the blue then yeah rude. But he tried to blame YOU?! I think the eff not sir.", "NTA\n\nYou warned him as best you could, but he refused to hear it. He probably is hurting and humiliated, but that's what happens when you wilfully persist in doing stupid things.", "NTA, but just for future reference...  \"Told you so\" is always a lot more effective when you don't actually say it aloud.    The other party \\*knows.\\*", "I want to be sympathetic to him because fck cheating and paternity fraud. \n\nBut damn, getting in a relationship with a promiscuous woman who cheated with your ex-boyfriend.

She's a cheater.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd it really doesn't sound like you did the classic \"told you so\" in a mocking way.

So there was no chance to convince him.", "NTA", "NTA, hope he learns", "\u201cOnce a cheater, always a cheater\u201d is a saying for a reason. You tried to warn him. He didn\u2019t listen.

His ignoring you is his own fault. \n\n\u201cYou can take a horse to water but you can\u2019t make it drink\u201d. You led him to water. He\u2019d rather die of dyhydration. Now he\u2019s whining because he is thirsty.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA!  \nYou tried!! He didn't want to hear it. You showed him proof, he didn't want to see it.

Normally I don\u2019t think saying \u201cI told you so\u201d is redeemable but he literally complained about not being told so. Completely justified imo.", "NTA: Your brother is not an asshole, but he definitely is not the brightest. If he knows she got passed around like potatoes on thanksgiving AND he gets shown proof she is still mashing it up on the side, he should\u2019ve broke it off then and there. I get denial is a thing, but he has no right to blame you for anything", "NAH: Your not wrong you did give fair warning.

He was being an asshole because he's been keeping all these emotions bottled up and refusing to see the truth because it's so abhorrent to him. You're a little the asshole because you could have bit your tongue right that second and recognized that he was lashing out because he's currently in distress and unsure of where to go from here.\n\nIt was an opportunity to actually be the bigger person. I suggest focusing on his hurt right now and telling him that you can be there to listen and help him sort through what to do next. He's your brother, and he's hurting. Focus on that for now. \n\nThere will be time to hash out who was right and who was wrong and who should have listened to the person with the fucking receipts in hand.\n\nYou weren't wrong.

Smug little barb to make sure that everyone knows that you were right and he was wrong.\n\nGuy's at the lowest point of his life.

Wow. \n\nAnd to top it off, now he has to go to court to get everything sorted out legally which is a hassle emotionally and financially. Youre all in your early twenties so young.

And then to go to your mom and sister completely broken only to be told \u201cI told you so\u201d because of mindless ranting during the worst time of his life?!

You\u2019re not the AH, but he\u2019s in hell right now.", "NTA. normally, yes, it isn't nice to rub things in someone's nose right after it happened, but in this case he quite literally asked for it by trying to defer blame onto you. you quite literally did tell him so.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to place the blame for it on her, and for believing her on himself.\n\nYou literally have no part to play in this mess.", "If you had told him \"I told you so\" directly after receiving the news I would have said you're the AH but him shifting the blame to you like that makes you definitely NTA", "NTA.\n\nNormally, I'm against kicking people when they're down.  Damage is already done and it's gone past the point of correction.  At that point, you're just doing damage control.\n\nHowever, that's not what you did.  Alot of people shoot the messenger because it's less painful than having to admit what your partner has done.  That's part of why the cheatee is often the last person to know.  If you press him, he'd probably admit that you would have lost him had you pressed further.  You already took the chance of being the messenger once.  There wasn't anything else you could do after presenting him with the truth.  He already knew her character before they got together.  Personally, I think it's the other way around and he owed you an apology for knowingly bringing her back into your life.", "NTA.

I don't even think you really said \"I told you so\" in the mocking sense? You literally told him so and he's claiming you didn't.

He's understandably hurt and is trying to shift the blame to feel a little better. However, you did warn him, and he was a shitty brother to you. You don't have to take the blame now when he did this to himself.", "NTA but you really shouldn\u2019t reconcile with your brother until he apologizes for blaming AND for ignoring your warnings and cutting you off. Ignore your mother. Don\u2019t be the bigger person and reach out first, which your mother will probably ask. It\u2019s time for your brother to grow up and make things right with you, not the other way around", "NTA. You tried to warn him and he just didn't want to believe his girlfriend cheated. As you go through life, you will find that what people want to believe is often more important than the truth. When people don't want to hear something, they will try to rationalize and explain things away, no matter how much others try to point out the reality of a situation.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, but try to remember your brother was only being human in the way he denied reality and didn't want to listen to you. Many people are blinded by romantic love and will ignore major red flags about a new lover because they desperately want the relationship to work out.\n\nHe's just upset now, so he's lashing out at whoever is close by, and you are a convenient target. Don't take it personally. Give him plenty of time to get over this disappointment. Once he has some time to get over the worst of the anguish and settles down enough to think rationally, he's going to see that you tried and you were looking out for his best interest.

OP suffered a lot by his words and doings already and was right to stand up against it instead of being a doormat.", "Then don\u2019t ask stupid questions when people been warning you about things you\u2019ve been doing", "He told her that she should have \"warned him more.\"  In this case \"I did warn you\" is an appropriate response.", "It's not great behaviour but guess what, nobody's perfect and after being treated like crap then completely vindicated by the truth I'd say if a 100% justified \"I told you so\" is the worst this guy gets, he's getting off lucky.", "I would normally agree, but he asked for it when he continually blamed her. \"I told you so\" is literally her main defense against that accusation.", "I\u2019m sorry - but no one gets to blame someone else for their dumb decisions just because they\u2019re \u201clow\u201d.", "I've seen your other comments. \n\nAren't you her brother", "I agree, I guess I just feel for everyone involved. Hard for me to call a guy an AH when his world just came down, and definitely feel for the sister too.  Nobody wins here.", "But he wasnt thinking clearly. He just had his whole world turned upside down. If I was the sister I would understand his anger wasnt towards me and he wasnt thinking clearly.", "What?", "OP, you did nothing wrong.  You defended yourself against a false attack.  He's only hurting because of his own stupidity and weak will.", "There's a time and a place for everything but this wasn't the time nor place. \n\nHe's humiliated beyond belief.", "Serious question: is this a very small town?  Why is there so much overlap all around?", "I don't think his misplaced anger (misplaced blame?) was OK or called for either, but it doesn't make what she said not asshole-y.", "[deleted]", "\ud83d\udcafpercent correct", "That's very compassionate, but he's still being an asshole to the family he came to for support.  When I went home to lick my wounds after being cheated on, I didn't berate my family for my own bad choices.", "They were trying to respond to lunarenergy, the comment below you, and ended up on yours instead. They said he was in a relationship with an abuser.", "He turned on her and started blaming her for not doing more. Why turn on the one person who was warning and telling him the whole time but he didn\u2019t listen. OP isn\u2019t the AH here", "Disagree. What was she supposed to do, agree with him that it was all her fault and she should\u2019ve done more? He decided it was the time and place for placing blame, so she took his cue and corrected the record. He doesn\u2019t get to make up his own narrative just because he\u2019s upset. I doubt she would have even brought it up if he didn\u2019t try to blame her", "If you want empathy from people don't make false accusations and try to blame them for your own actions.\n\nHumble people deserve empathy.", "It\u2019s called being honest. It\u2019s not like the sister was being an asshole to her brother. He didn\u2019t want to listen and see the signs, so he can deal with the consequences. Don\u2019t try to blame the others for not \u201cwarning\u201d you. Everyone is capable of making their own decisions so they should be capable of accepting the consequences", "Honesty without compassion is cruelty.  Yes it's important to be honest but being tactful is also important", "That's all fine and good but it doesn't apply here. Tact went out the window when he doubled down on gaslighting her into thinking she was somehow the cause of all this when she in fact warned him multiple times."]}
