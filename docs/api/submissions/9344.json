Our families had never met before.\n\nWhen she met my family, she was immediately extremely rude to my family. She spoke to her parents in Spanish (their native language) not realizing that my father is from Venezuela and taught all of his children Spanish. She complained in a nasty voice about how my family was underdressed for a family dinner (they all had just gotten off a very long plane ride and came straight from dropping their luggage off at my house), how my little sister's baby wouldn't stop crying, etc. My father tried to speak to her in Spanish and she gave him a nasty glare and said she was going to wait in the car.\n\nShe was rude and belittling to me and my family the entire week they were there visiting for the wedding.\n\nShe refused to even acknowledge my family the entire time they were with us and my husband found it so obnoxious he refused to see her while my family was here, making her upset. She was one of my bridesmaids but she made everyone else feel extremely uncomfortable. She refused to come to my bridesmaids events (only came when the groomsmen came too), left 20 minutes into my bachelorette party to go to a club without saying goodbye, was very mean to my other bridesmaids and sisters, and didn't even want to get ready with the bridesmaids morning of the wedding. She called my mother (who doesn't speak Spanish) nasty names in Spanish to her face, and she had AirPods in 24/7 and actively ignored everyone who talked to her.\n\nMy whole family left after the wedding and she hadn't spoken more than one sentence to my family. I called her out and she broke down explaining how she felt like my family had stolen my husband from her family and was jealous. I told her that was no excuse to treat my family the way she did. (I have a list of every little thing she did on my phone that was rude the whole week.... the list is 134 times long and we barely saw her.) I told her I appreciate her apology. She took that as being forgiven and treats me like a friend now.\n\nFast forward back to now and she's really upset I refused to be one of her bridesmaids. My husband agrees with my stance and reiterated to her why I refused.

I just assumed she would be happy because she said she loved me. It might make me the asshole because I told my husband to ignore her texts and calls because I was so upset. Those might have been her trying to reach out. I probably should have tried to get her to be happy but I was so angry about that first dinner with everyone that I kept that as my image of her.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
