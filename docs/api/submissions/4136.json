When we moved in together I had to take out loans to pay for all the essentials, appliances and furnishings for the house as the only available property we could find in the area that he was allowed to live (determined by the ex as she wanted to live her and has primary custody of the child and my ex partner doesn\u2019t drive)  was an unfurnished one! He wasn\u2019t able to financially do this and at no point in the 2yrs since we have been here has he purchased any new furnishings or appliances or even offered to help with the costs! I\u2019ve been left to make this place a home for the 3 of us. \nWe have recently broken up, not under great circumstances as I was made to feel left out of everything as he would make decisions on which weekends he would have the child with child\u2019s mother and not include me, so I could never make plans for us! I was always an after thought to include in their decisions. \nNow that it\u2019s over I am sorting out my stuff to move and I am being made to feel like the villain for taking all the furniture and appliances that I have paid for.

Should I be leaving all my possessions behind for him to take ownership of cause he has a child and I have to just accept the financial loss and start all over again from scratch?
