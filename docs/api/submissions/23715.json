He was not mad at me. He acknowledged it is his responsibility for waking up on time and getting himself to work. I showed him this post and all your comments, and he agreed with the comments saying, \"The room would still be there tomorrow. it wasn't urgent. it was an overreaction. to the situation. \" I agreed with him. I retaliated for a separate issue (him making me late) rather than communicating. He did make it to work on time for those wondering. Thank you for all your comments. For all the people saying break up, neither of us plan on breaking up over one instance. We have been together for 4 years and each of us have made mistakes or over reacted at some point. \n\nLast night, I [23 F]  texted and asked my boyfriend [25 M] to come down to the basement where my office space and new futon are. He replied \"nah\" and then asked me me to come upstairs to go to bed. (He probably wanted cuddles) \n\nBut I told him it  was important to me, and I wanted him to come see my new arrangement/new set up in the basement. He didn't reply to my text. So I slept downstairs on the futon. \n\nThis morning, I left without him to go to work (we work at the same place). He called me and asked me if I overslept. He assumed I was still at home in the basement. I said no, I left. \n\nHe was in so much shock that he kept asking me, \"Did you actually leave me? You're not at work.\" \n\nThen I tried to tell him, \"I asked you to see something that was important to me. And you ignored me.\"\n\nHe got mad. He said he slept through his alarms. You really left me. Over that?\" \n\nThen I tried to tell him again, \"I'm mad because I said it was something IMPORTANT to ME, but  you -\" But before I could finish my sentence, he ended the call. \n\nhow I feel about it at this moment is: \n\nIf he's too lazy to drive himself, I understand. He has his own car, but if we're going to the same place, it makes sense to drive together. But missing your alarms? You're an adult. You should wake yourself up and if you don't you'll be late to work. That's on you. Don't rely on me to be your mommy and wake you up and wait for you to get ready. I don't know.. \n\nI feel bad for hurting his feelings and literally leaving him behind. But at the same time, he's an adult who has his own car and his own job separate from mine. If he's late, that's on him. Why should I have to be late every morning because he can't wake himself up on time. Or vice versa. I don't want to make him late because of me. \n\nI felt so much better without the responsibility of taking care of him in the mornings. But now I feel bad. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for leaving my boyfriend behind while I drove to our workplace in my car?", "created_utc": 1690974666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g61zn/aita_for_leaving_my_boyfriend_behind_while_i/", "score": 912, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of telling him he hurt your feelings (even just by text on your way to work), you chose to let him know by deviating from your shared schedule as though he can read your mind. It is not your fault he slept through his alarms and was late to work, but it is gallingly naive to pretend like that wouldn't have the potential to screw up his morning given that you typically get ready and go to work together. And if you knew that's what would happen and were hoping for it, that's troubling. \n\nYour resentment towards your bf's reliance on you every work morning is completely valid. You didn't sign up to mommy him and he should be able to get himself up without you having to fuss him about it. Girlfriends tend to end up with an unfairly large share of time management/housework responsibilities and if you are made to feel responsible for him getting to work on time every single morning, I can absolutely see how draining that would be. The hurt you felt that he didn't respond to your text about coming down to see your new set up is also completely valid. But the healthy way forward would have been to talk about both of those things with him at some point during the day, not just removing yourself from your home like he would automatically be able to infer how you were feeling based on that action. \n\nHumor me and imagine you fall asleep waiting for your gf to come to bed and the next thing you know, you're waking up, you're late for work bc you slept through your alarms, and you think your gf must have too. But you call her and she's already at work and pissed off at you because you didn't reply to her last text. That would be a horrible way to start your morning - I know I'd be upset \n\nOf course, it's entirely possible I'm full of BS and it didn't go down this way, he saw the text and ignored it, etc etc. But the point is, in a relationship, you give your partner the benefit of the doubt and you communicate your needs when you can't.

BUT and yes there is a but if this is something that u normally do everyday and u just chose not to do it that day because u were butthurt he didn\u2019t get up out of bed to look a where u moved furniture to the brown the eff up if I had pulled this I would be the AH if I just decided ya know what I\u2019m not waking up at 4:50 this morning cuz he\u2019s being a meanie head and hurted my feewings as a result my husband now misses work and could possibly my get in trouble or worse all because all because I got my panties so twisted they wadded up my tootie crack that\u2019s my fault I caused him to miss work now had I TOLD him he I\u2019m not waking up tmrw at 4:50 u need to make sure u get urself up cuz I will not be doing it then that\u2019s on him because I told him I communicated to him ya know like an ADULT or if I had said hey that really upset me that u ignored me (I\u2019m trying out myself in a Monday where seeing this room is so important to me but i can\u2019t some ima use something else) when I wanted u to come downstairs and help my catch the dog after he broke his chain (because that\u2019s a good reason to ask someone to get out of bed ) u dismissed me and it was upsetting and because I\u2019m upset tmrw I will not be getting up early u r an adult and I should not have to wake u up everyday because u can\u2019t act like one", "You\u2019re mad bc he wanted to sleep and not see a setup he could see the next day? Childish af", "ESH, sounds like there are some other issues at work here besides the stated ones. No, you shouldn't have to be his mother and ensure he gets to work on time, but you also need to learn to express your feelings with words.  Tell him he hurt your feelings and you overreacted by sleeping downstairs, girl I'm not sleeping on a futon for anyone, explain you don't want to be responsible for his morning routine in the future and from now on if he isn't in your car by a specific time, you'll need to leave to ensure you're on time.\n\nCommunication is key for a successful relationship neither of you seems good at that yet, which is fine you're both young just learn and move on.", "YTA\n\nYou slept on the futon because he was already in bed? Look sister, I don\u2019t get back out of bed unless a baby\u2019s crying. It can wait until the morning. It is the same level of important then. It was important, but not urgent", "While not wanting to be someone's mom is totally justified, usually something more needs to happen. A discussion, for example, when you say \"I'm tired of momming you, I know that you count on it happening here and there, so count no more.\"", "We're all very impressed. Please teach us how to be as perfect as you and your wife. Real relationships never have any arguments or misunderstanding ever, apparently. Heaven forbid.", "Good grief. Stop it. Answers like this are embarrassing. Telling people that you know literally nothing about that they need to break up over one extremely minor argument. You know how people make fun of this reddit because redditors will immediately jump to absurd, extreme, and asinine conclusions with zero justification? Yeah....", "If I'm already in bed, it's time to sleep and the whatever they worked on would be right there in the morning - I wouldn't go. Among other reasons because my reaction in this case would be \"wow, it's awesome, can we go sleep now?\"\nAnd moving out - if that's her reaction of not coming running , then if would be more of coming my way in the future. If a person can't work with me on resolving conflicts it's easier to break it off asap", "Thank you! I appreciate your reverence, and am likewise impressed by your inability to consider the broader context of a comment and it's implications.", "So? Wake him up and make him drive himself. \n\nIt was petty revenge. If she wanted him to see it all she had to say is 'when you have the chance can you come give me your opinions on the basement?' People aren't at your beck and call, with some flexibility for some time sensitive things.\n\nGoing to work is time sensitive. She didn't have to wait around but it's petty to know he wasn't up like usually and leave him there. Especially as a one off.", "Or maybe, just maybe, she loves him otherwise and just doesn't like the one minor aspect of needing to make sure he was up and ready in the mornings? This may shock you, but... ppl don't like 100% of everything about their SO's. People can dislike one thing about a relationship while still being happy in the relationship as a whole. There is zero reason to assume that she is as unhappy as what you are projecting onto this.", "If I was lazy enough to need my partner to wake me up every day and then I offended them to the point that they don't come to the room to sleep together, I'd at least make sure to wake up by myself. \n\nI agree that it was petty, but I don't think that it was wrong. OP isn't his mother and he should be able to function like the adult he is without her extra help.\n\nAlso, the problem isn't that he didn't go to see the basement but the way he dismissed her without a second thought.", "my ex & i were both very difficult-to-wake people. i\u2019d snooze right through my alarms but wake up to his, & vice versa. depended on where we were at in a REM cycle if the alarms had any effect. the AC unit in our room was loud as fuck. my phone as loud as it would go wouldn\u2019t wake me.  \nwe helped each other in the morning. we\u2019re in our early 30s & both neurodivergent. doubt we\u2019re going to grow out of it.", "The question is how does normal day looks like. If she always wakes him up or wakes and starts moving around at the same time then he totally can be upset about her not doing it. \nBasically, if I wake you up every morning for a month, and then stop without warning, saying that you are a grown-up and could have woken up to alarm doesn't convey the whole picture. Yes, you could, but you didn't know you had to.\nAlso, while he has his car, we don't know if it's in a ready-to-use condition. If they are always going on hers it might not be.", "I said work routine. Routines are different from a schedule and she even says they usually drive together as they work in the same place. The man didn\u2019t know where she was when he woke up which is why he reached out asking her if she had left. And she then brought up how the reason she left was cause he didn\u2019t go see the room. That\u2019s vindictive by definition. She did something deliberately out of spite because he didn\u2019t do what she wanted. That\u2019s  the definition of vindictive. You don\u2019t fuck with peoples jobs because you don\u2019t get your way. It\u2019s called being a mature adult in an adult relationship. You want space that\u2019s cool but communicate that.", "Sometimes something is punitive and sometimes something is a natural consequence. \n\nBeing dismissive of your partner generally means they want some space after. \n\nAgain OP was aware that he sets alarms and has his own vehicle. This is a \u201cproblem\u201d he could solve.\n\nAlso not sure when she could communicate that as he went to sleep the night before and she left \n\nAgain I\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t petty but to act like this was some underhanded malicious act is silly", "If you read the posted she said he communicated it the next morning but she had already left him. Honestly if they communicated verbally and not in text they probably could have avoided this whole thing in general. But she clearly says her actions were connected to him not doing what she asked. You can call it petty but I\u2019m gonna call it what it is which is vindictive."]}
