He replied \"nah\" and then asked me me to come upstairs to go to bed. (He probably wanted cuddles). \n\nBut I told him it  was important to me and I wanted him to come see my new arrangement/new set up in the basement. He didn't reply to my text. So I slept downstairs on the futon. \n\nThis morning I left without him to go to work (we work at the same place). He called me and asked me if I overslept. He assumed I was still at home in the basement. I said no I left. \n\nHe was in so much shock he kept asking me \"did you actually leave me? You're not at work.\" \n\nThen I tried to tell him \"I asked you to see something that was important to me. And you ignored me.\"\n\nHe got mad. He said he slept through his alarms. You really left me. Over that?\" \n\nThen I tried to tell him again \"I'm mad because I said it was someting IMPORTANT to ME, but  you--\" But before I could finish my sentence he ended the call. \n\nhow I feel about it in this moment is: \n\nIf he's too lazy to drive himself I understand. He has his own car but if we're going to the same place it makes sense to drive together. But missing your alarms? You're an adult. You should wake yourself up and if you don't you'll be late to work. That's on you. Don't rely on me to be your mommy and wake you up and wait for you to get ready. I don't know.. \n\nI feel bad for hurting his feelings and literally leaving him behind. But at the same time he's an adult who has his own car and his own job separate from mine. If he's late that's on him. Why should I have to be late every morning because he can't wake himself up on time. Or vice versa I don't want to make him late because of me. \n\nI felt so much better without the responsibility of taking care of him in the mornings. But now I feel bad. \n\nSo, Am I the asshole for leaving my boyfriend behind while I drove to our workplace in my car?", "created_utc": 1690974666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g61zn/aita_for_leaving_my_boyfriend_behind_while_i/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This kinda reads both like he is at work asking where you are because you arent there and if you broke up with him over the argument but also reads like you left him at home and he was still there. Sorry if my morning brain is missing something", "ESH. So effing petty man.", "ESH\n\nFair enough you don't want him to treat you like his mommy and have to wake him up\n\nBut you want to treat him like your mommy and have him come say well done, look how pretty you made the room - in the way a toddler makes their mommy come look when they have tidied up\n\nNeither of you are adult enough to be a grown up relationship", "ESH yall need to grow up, at least you deserve each other.", "You two best get a older lodger in so they can look after you both. As it seems you both act like kids.", "I\u2019m confused why you couldn\u2019t have showed him your workplace the next day. It was late and time for bed and you even knew he just wanted cuddles. You are incredibly immature.  You even acted out again the next morning by leaving on your own. Your boyfriend is also immature for expecting you to be his mother and wake him up for work. You both suck and need to grow up if you want your relationship to last", "I think YTA is a more fair option than esh. He was pretty insensitive to you in the evening, but only you did things to purposely punish your partner.\n\nAlso I think that partners can rely on repeating the routine and if you want to change the routine - you should notify your partner. If you always wake up together and make sure you both wake up - you both can rely on it. So I think \"I'm not his mommy\" is a very bad justification for you. You did this only because you wanted to make him bad.", "YTA that is bat shit crazy", "NTA for leaving him behind -- he has his own alarm and his own car, this is a responsibility he should be able to handle with or without you. Maybe a little petty about the futon and that doesn't bode well for future fights or disagreements.", "Good god. ESH. \n\nYou both are immature and not ready to be in a relationship", ">(He probably wanted cuddles).\n\nIs he 4??? That would give me the ICK.", "YTA. grow up.", "I've been this petty", "While he\u2019s a grown man who can get himself up and as he has a car get himself to work that\u2019s not why you left him behind. You were trying to make a point. Either he does what you tell him when you tell him or you will punish him for it. It was petty and spiteful and I can get why he\u2019s peeved. If he was comfy in bed and didn\u2019t fancy dragging himself down to the basement to see it right at that moment when it could have waited till the next day and then you did this yeah I think you will be single soon enough YTA", "ESH\n\nGrow up.", "So you guys are really great communicators and partners huh?\n\nESH", "ESH, you're both idiots", "NTA I think you realized this morning you are tired of caring for a grown man. Tell him going forward he needs to wake himself up and get ready for work if he wants to ride with you, if not he can\u2019t take himself to work. You are not responsible for him waking up. \n\nA warning would be nice, but you should not have to wake him go every morning.", "Wow, you literally threw a tantrum over him not coming to see how you rearranged your desk. You sound unhinged.\n\nMajor YTA. If I were him I'd be reconsidering the relationship.", "Bit of both, NTA for leaving him to go to work (he is an adult and is responsible for getting himself up on time. You veer into A H territory for hiding in the basement instead of using your words to get your point across.", "ESH. I think you two have bigger problems than the situation you chose to post about. You both need to grow up.", "Its a partner ignoring the small things that are important to you that will tell you its not going to last\n\nNTA- because i know how that feels. He is an an adult and can drive on his own. \n\nDo leave, itll only get worse", "Going with ESH.\n\nYes, he's an asshole for not caring about something that was important to you.\n\nYou're an asshole for leaving him behind.  \n\nBoth of you were acting like children here.", "NTA\n\nHe ignored you when this was something important to you.  Then he screwed up and slept through his own alarms.", "ESH.  You are both immature.", "Y\u2019all are both way too immature to be in a relationship.", "Passive aggressive and immature.  They need to break up and grow up", "This! You both need to grow up.", "So glad this is the top comment because this was my thought exactly!", "It sounds like he was already in bed or at the best least ready to go to bed when she texted him in which case she would completely be the asshole", "Was the basement \"time sensitive\"?  Was it going to be gone the next day? LOL.  OP is just petty and childish.", "OPs reaction was vindictive in nature. Both are to blame but I don\u2019t think OP had to be vindictive about it.", "Petty would have been turning his alarms off and sabotaging him. She didn't do that. She is allowed to be upset. She is allowed to get herself to work on time. She shouldn't have to babysit him for him to be up on time.", "Facts. I see it the same way too. It\u2019s vindictive.", "Seems to look that way.", "This.\n\nTo everyone saying she doesn\u2019t need to mother him and wake him up in the morning, you are correct. But was that their normal routine and she changed it on him without warning? \n\nShe didn\u2019t say: \u201cI\u2019m not your mother, set your own alarm tomorrow\u201d, giving him a chance to do that. She just changed the routine to suit herself and make him look and feel foolish/bad. As someone who lives with a diagnosed NPD/ASPD (who brought along a BPD ex), this is \u201ccrazy making\u201d behavior.\n\nAll because he wasn\u2019t excited to get out of bed to see her space that he could see once he was well rested and maybe could feign more interest, anyway?\n\nOP leaves out what time of night it was. My daughter loves to stay up until 3am organizing and arranging things in her house. That is not her husband\u2019s problem though, and she wouldn\u2019t ever expect it to be lol. \n\nOP, your man might need to learn to set his own alarm, but in this instance, YTAH and you might want to actually seek some counseling to nip some of these problematic behaviors in the bud before they get out of hand in your relationships.", "She\u2019d be better off. He\u2019s too lazy to wake himself up and drive himself to work.", "\ud83d\ude02 the silent treatment?   He was in bed how do you know he didn\u2019t fall asleep", "Exactly especially if it\u2019s rare that it happens.", "Yeah she is kinda mixing two different \"issues\" in the story. But I don't think their relationship is going to last very long if she keep getting mad about the smallest things.", "But choosing to sleep in the basement just because he didn't feel like coming down to see something she wanted to show him at that exact time is super passive aggressive. Unless there's more to this story, it's an overreaction to be sure.", "Don't mess around with people's work routines without telling them in advance.", "Agreed. I would have been super hurt if I had asked my partner to come look at something I'd done that I was excited about and their response was... \"nah.\" Now if he had said something like, \"Sorry, babe, I just got in bed and I'm really tired, but I'd love to see it tomorrow!\" I'd be much more on his side. But he just shut her down.", "No she is okay to not wake him up it\u2019s not her job. But the only reason why she didn\u2019t wake him up was because she was mad. She specifically said she did it because she was still mad. That\u2019s why it\u2019s petty. If you don\u2019t do it just cause, or maybe you think they left that\u2019s fine. But to do it because you are mad is petty, because you are purposely fucking up their money. He is TA as well. But she is a bigger one", "And she\u2019s a childish ah who stomps her feet because someone didn\u2019t get out of bed to see a room the moment she wanted them to.", "In fairness when my husband and I were on the same schedule he often came to bed after me and would set the alarm since the clock was on his side of the bed.  If I fell a sleep and he decided to pout and sleep on his futon and not come to bed I wouldn't have known to wake up and set the alarm.  FULL disclosure we don't have a futon and neither of us would behave in such a childish manner, LOL.", "And she (OP) sabotages him for work. Big no no right there.", "Except OP stated his alarms went off, he just slept through them, plus has his own car.", "Wait. How did she sabotage him? By not checking that he woke up for work?  Isn\u2019t that his responsibility?  The fact that OP had an easier better morning by not being responsible for a grown ass man, tells me this relationship has run it\u2019s course. He pouted and hung up on her.  He didn\u2019t wake up to his alarm.  He blames her.", "How did she sabotage him? He has his own car and his own alarms he slept through. She was definitely being petty but she in no way prevented him from getting to work.", "She didn't sabotage him -- that would be like if she turned off his alarms.", "If her partner was used to being woken up and driven by her then changing the morning routine one morning without telling him is sabotage.", "yeah sure, if he was a child. except he\u2019s an adult with his own car and he can set his own alarms", "I agree that he can drive his own car and set his own alarms. But that is not the pattern the two have developed. She can't change the morning routine on a whim.", "Okay, but if he usually DOESN\u2019T set an alarm, because there\u2019s already one set (why would you set two??), a heads up saying \u201cI\u2019m sleeping downstairs, so set an alarm\u201d would be nice. It\u2019s basic human decency.", "he did set his own alarms and slept through them. but that\u2019s not OPs responsibility to go and wake him up to get ready for work. \n\nif he\u2019s already running late, he should have just drove his own car. it\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t have another way to get to work \n\noverall i agree it\u2019s esh, but it\u2019s not sabotage lol", "the OP literally said:\n> He said he slept through his alarms.", "Maybe he sets the alarm then she showers and then he gets up. \n\nThe responsible action to take is to warn the person. \u201dFrom now on starting tomorrow, I will no longer be your second alarm.\u201d Not lead OP into thinking the routines have not changed. That's sabotage."]}
