He replied \"nah\" and then asked me me to come upstairs to go to bed. (He probably wanted cuddles). \n\nBut I told him it  was important to me and I wanted him to come see my new arrangement/new set up in the basement. He didn't reply to my text. So I slept downstairs on the futon. \n\nThis morning I left without him to go to work (we work at the same place). He called me and asked me if I overslept. He assumed I was still at home in the basement. I said no I left. \n\nHe was in so much shock he kept asking me \"did you actually leave me? You're not at work.\" \n\nThen I tried to tell him \"I asked you to see something that was important to me. And you ignored me.\"\n\nHe got mad. He said he slept through his alarms. You really left me. Over that?\" \n\nThen I tried to tell him again \"I'm mad because I said it was someting IMPORTANT to ME, but  you--\" But before I could finish my sentence he ended the call. \n\nhow I feel about it in this moment is: \n\nIf he's too lazy to drive himself I understand. He has his own car but if we're going to the same place it makes sense to drive together. But missing your alarms? You're an adult. You should wake yourself up and if you don't you'll be late to work. That's on you. Don't rely on me to be your mommy and wake you up and wait for you to get ready. I don't know.. \n\nI feel bad for hurting his feelings and literally leaving him behind. But at the same time he's an adult who has his own car and his own job separate from mine. If he's late that's on him. Why should I have to be late every morning because he can't wake himself up on time. Or vice versa I don't want to make him late because of me. \n\nI felt so much better without the responsibility of taking care of him in the mornings. But now I feel bad. \n\nSo, Am I the asshole for leaving my boyfriend behind while I drove to our workplace in my car?", "created_utc": 1690974666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g61zn/aita_for_leaving_my_boyfriend_behind_while_i/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(I\u2019m assuming the room will look like it did last night when you get home today ... so really was not urgent or an emergency)\n\nThe rest of the stuff you just added to justify your own actions which were petty & in my opinion mean spirited. You apparently have a routine in the morning.... you changed it because you were mad.", "ESH. Surely two chronological adults can manage their own behaviour and actually act like adults?", "Holy shit I would break up with you on the spot. What an insane over reaction to not seeing a fucking futon.\n\nYTA", "ESH- Everyone acting immature as all hell here.", "JFC yes YTA, he definitely can drive his own car but if this is what you do EVERYDAY why would he randomly plan for that to be the case? You\u2019re childish and should not be in a relationship", "YTA and vindictive it seems. \n\nWhile I agree that it\u2019s his job to get himself up, you refused to come to bed, or give him a lift this morning because he wouldn\u2019t look at your new set up?! Cmon! Act like an adult", "YTA. You messed with a work routine because of a personal tiff. Don't mess around with people's work routines without telling them in advance.", "I was going to say you were the AH . . . until you said he had his own car. If he can\u2019t wake himself up in time to go to work, that\u2019s his own fault. Do you always wake him up when he sleeps through his alarms?", "Yta - ur petty and vengeful he was tired in bed. I don\u2019t wanna come down to the basement. It could\u2019ve waited for the next day.", "YTA - I'd take the day off work, and move out before you got back.", "NTA. You would be the asshole if he didnt have a car which is how I was reading it until you said otherwise. \n\nI do agree that he shouldn't rely on you to wake up for his alarms, but if it is a long term relationship I would definitely try to make sure my partner got up on time, even the morning after a fight, but not doing so doesn't make you the asshole. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe line about why should you have to be late every morning for him suggests there is a different separate issue here as well about you simply not wanting to drive him to work. Maybe have a conversation with him around this as well, about how you want to leave at x time and if hes not in the car you are liable to drive away as you want to be prompt to work.", "ESH you\u2019re both acting like children.

Grow up.", "You actually slept on a futon simply because your boyfriend had the *audacity* to fall asleep or simply keep relaxing before he could haul his tired ass out of bed and go see you setup?!!?!?!\n\nwow YTA\n\nFor that alone, I'm not even gonna start on you purposefully changing your morning routine out of spite.\n\nNo, it's not your responsibility to \"be a mommy\" and wake an adult man every morning. Yes, it is your responsibility to be an adult yourself and be able to differentiate petty grievances from actual reasons to NOT behave like a person in a couple.", "NTA.

Jesus", "ESH", "YTA not sure why it's not obvious to you. You didn't wake him up coz he didn't see your setup from night before end of story. If you're so upset about \"being his mommy\" why be with him", "So to be clear, it sounds like in the wider context of your relationship he is consistently the AH. Making you responsible for getting him up on time is a sucky move. \n\nHowever in this instance, your retribution was excessive for the situation described. He was ready for bed, has problems enough getting up in the morning and didn't want to drop everything to see your space right that minute. In return, you ditched him after arranging to give him a lift. \n\nYou were in the wrong in this incident, especially if its a one off behavior. If you reacted this strongly because your bf has a long history of not giving a crap about things that excite you... thats a whole other issue to handle", "ESH.  However, you are correct in that he's a grown up and he can get his big boy pants on and get his ass outta bed and off to work.", "ESH \u2014- what a petty and immature thing for you to do. Yes he could have come down but he may not have known how much you wanted him to come downstairs. You actively choosing to be this immature to him makes you even more of an AH. \n\nAre you sure you\u2019re old enough to be in a relationship?", "I had to scroll up to check your ages because I thought you were a couple of teenagers squabbling. \n\nESH, you\u2019re both childish.", "Well, three minutes or so before you grabbed your keys and went to the car, you could have yelled up the stairs, \u201cHey, you ready to go?!\u201d\n\nBecause one would assume you both  leave at about the same time every morning and being ready to go, when you went, would have been a normal daily thing.\n\nAnd you are correct, it is not your job to make sure a grown ass man does not \u201csleep through his alarms\u201d. Plural. Alarm*s*.\n\nBut you were both still giving each the cold shoulder, you with no idea why your BF couldn\u2019t be bothered to go downstairs and see your setup, and your BF, with WTF, she left without me???\n\nYou both suck at communicating. But your BF has his own car and can get to work all by himself, it\u2019s not like you stranded him. So, NTA", "> He called and asked me if I overslept. He assumed I was still at home in the basement. \n\nHe couldn\u2019t even be bothered go down to check on her where he assumed she was? And *shes* the petty one? Okay\u2026", "Nta for the going to work and not waking a grown man like a 7yr old.  \n\nHowever, the silent treatment is incredible immature! \n\nYou are completely correct- him ignoring you is not ok. You stated a reasonable desire/need and he couldn't be bothered to walk a set of steps. NO! \n\nPersonally I would be done with this relationship.", "NTA - he\u2019s annoyed you didn\u2019t wake him up and he was late for work! \n\nHe had all the means to get himself up and get to work!
