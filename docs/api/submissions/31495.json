His two kids (3 and 6) are generally well-behaved but they're still kids, so I let him know to keep them out of the bonus room (currently half-finished) and my craft room.\n\nYou all know where this is going so I'll just cut to the chase. I came home yesterday to find the kids splayed out on the living room floor surrounded by art supplies in ruined condition. They were finger painting with my gouache and had completely cross-contaminated the colors, drawn on my good watercolor paper with copic markers (completely crushing the tips of the markers as well) and ruined or dirtied several items that my friend had brought me from Korea.\n\nI confronted my brother, who was nonchalantly watching TV, and he told me that he didn't let the kids go in the craft room, he had gone in himself and grabbed them \"just a couple things\" to entertain themselves with. He agreed to buy me replacements until I actually started tallying up the cost\u2014then backtracked and said the price was \"bullshit\" and started insisting that most of the stuff was still in usable condition.\n\nI said fine, you don't have to replace anything, but you can forget about vacation money. He snapped at me not to argue in front of the kids, I said who's arguing? Sounds like the conversation is over.\n\nNow he wants me to pay the vacation money immediately and work out the replacing of the art supplies after. I feel like he's just going to try to haggle me, or is going to replace my stuff with Crayola and call it even.\n\nUpdate: The cost to replace the ruined items minus the Korean supplies would be about $225. Getting an idea of the replacement cost of the Korean stuff is a bit harder\u2014it was mostly journaling/stationery supplies so I'm not 100% sure how to determine the cost of, for example, a half-used book of stickers or a bullet journal that has several pages scribbled in. There was also a set of stamps that the kids tried to use gouache/markers on, which I'm not yet sure if they are going to need replacing or if they can be cleaned off without staining.\n\nI was fully prepared to just compartmentalize this whole thing for the next day to get through the holiday, but my husband ended up making a call to my ex-SIL (brother's ex and the kid's mom) and discussed with her what had happened\u2014she was particularly upset that the 3-year-old was allowed to fingerpaint with supplies that were not specifically kid friendly and non-toxic, and she called my brother immediately and chewed him out for that. She also called our parents about it, which turned into a call from our mother to our brother, also chewing him out for being irresponsible. And although no one brought up the money angle (and I didn't expect them to,) he was rattled enough to apologize for yesterday and hasn't mentioned the money. I think I will just pay to replace what I can and consider us even.", "created_utc": 1700662240, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181a00n/aita_for_canceling_my_own_debt_to_my_brother/", "score": 4030, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His two kids (3 and 6) are generally well-behaved but they're still kids, so I let him know to keep them out of the bonus room (currently half-finished) and my craft room.\n\nYou all know where this is going so I'll just cut to the chase. I came home yesterday to find the kids splayed out on the living room floor surrounded by art supplies in ruined condition. They were finger painting with my gouache and had completely cross-contaminated the colors, drawn on my good watercolor paper with copic markers (completely crushing the tips of the markers as well) and ruined or dirtied several items that my friend had brought me from Korea.\n\nI confronted my brother, who was nonchalantly watching TV, and he told me that he didn't let the kids go in the craft room, he had gone in himself and grabbed them \"just a couple things\" to entertain themselves with. He agreed to buy me replacements until I actually started tallying up the cost\u2014then backtracked and said the price was \"bullshit\" and started insisting that most of the stuff was still in usable condition.\n\nI said fine, you don't have to replace anything, but you can forget about vacation money. He snapped at me not to argue in front of the kids, I said who's arguing? Sounds like the conversation is over.\n\nNow he wants me to pay the vacation money immediately and work out the replacing of the art supplies after. I feel like he's just going to try to haggle me, or is going to replace my stuff with Crayola and call it even.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe have a basket with kid friendly supplies that\u2019s theirs for when they come visit. It stays at your house so it\u2019s not another thing the parents have to remember/keep track of and when they want to be creative, they can go get their things. Maybe your brother could help fund this basket once he pays you back, and if not it\u2019s cheap insurance to avoid this happening again. \n\nMost importantly, this is between you and your brother.

He needs to replace things, but bigger picture don\u2019t let this affect a relationship.

Put away the expensive objects before throwing a raging party.  Put up tempting objects when hosting kids.   Avoid food allergens if you have allergic guests.  And yes,  think ahead about what the kids can play with,  because they are in a new space and will inevitably be curious about everything.    Everyone is completely responsible for themselves,  but the host still has responsibility to anticipate things that might be issues for them,  and address them.  There is more than 100% responsibility here,  because each party is addressing a different need.  I need to protect the things I value.  \n\nDon't misunderstand me here: dad was completely wrong to just grab some random art supplies to entertain the kids.  He should have turned on Bluey and achieved the same effect,  or brought out the tablets,  pr something.  I'd be upset too if  a guest grabbed my top shelf toys and said \"here, kids - have at it.\"  But yes,  I also have a duty to take protective steps.  To me,  that's all the toy kit is - protection by providing novelty for the kids.  \n\nSaying \"I shouldn't have to\" is well and good,  but reality is that a lot of things fall to whoever is invested in the end result.

OP did this - no question.  But I will take strong exception to the idea that the host shouldn't have to anticipate what guests are likely to do.  Whether you choose to mitigate this by saying \"kids under x are not welcome\" or by actively hosting kids is up to you.  It need not include extra expenses.  It may be that you have a bunch of old buttons,  an old pair of fancy shoes,  a tennis ball and a garage door, a stack of red Solo cups, a scratch pad and pen, or even a functioning TV you can tune to something they find hypnotic.  Yeah,  I go overboard.  But you can figure out something free or cheap.  I've entertained kids by getting them to look for interesting rocks in a field of pea gravel, paid them a quarter to find something I \"lost\", and showed them how to correctly play with my cats, and timed them to see how fast they could run to the end of the yard and back (big yard).  \n\nIf mom and dad aren't actively looking after their kids,  they aren't welcome back.  Well,  unless I'm explicitly babysitting.  But I do think if you welcome guests,  you plan for problems.  That's true of any age or issue.", "Lol, sure, you childless unwanted redditor.

So in your case they should have known the family would violate that rule and plan accordingly with expecting their stuff to get taken/broken or to go buy a lock? That seems really unfair and wrong to me. That feels like giving your guest a free pass to be shitty to you simply because you are hosting them in your home and 'should have known better and planned accordingly'. \n\nA guest should have some courtesy and know their hosts as well to also 'plan accordingly'. If you're going to a house of people who don't smoke you shouldn't expect them to put out ashtrays for you or allow you to smoke. Same for drinking. Here you have kids who obviously wouldn't know better because they're kids and their dad who should have known better and not go into a room he was told not to, take things he should not have taken, and allowed them to be broken simply because he didn't take his host into account and know his kids needed extra activities to not be bored. \n\nI get what your saying with finding items for cheap to entertain (although sadly none of those things would work on the kids in my family) but I feel that shouldn't be solely on the host to provide unless it's a specialized event or something that would require it.
