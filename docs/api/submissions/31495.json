His two kids (3 and 6) are generally well-behaved but they're still kids, so I let him know to keep them out of the bonus room (currently half-finished) and my craft room.\n\nYou all know where this is going so I'll just cut to the chase. I came home yesterday to find the kids splayed out on the living room floor surrounded by art supplies in ruined condition. They were finger painting with my gouache and had completely cross-contaminated the colors, drawn on my good watercolor paper with copic markers (completely crushing the tips of the markers as well) and ruined or dirtied several items that my friend had brought me from Korea.\n\nI confronted my brother, who was nonchalantly watching TV, and he told me that he didn't let the kids go in the craft room, he had gone in himself and grabbed them \"just a couple things\" to entertain themselves with. He agreed to buy me replacements until I actually started tallying up the cost\u2014then backtracked and said the price was \"bullshit\" and started insisting that most of the stuff was still in usable condition.\n\nI said fine, you don't have to replace anything, but you can forget about vacation money. He snapped at me not to argue in front of the kids, I said who's arguing? Sounds like the conversation is over.\n\nNow he wants me to pay the vacation money immediately and work out the replacing of the art supplies after. I feel like he's just going to try to haggle me, or is going to replace my stuff with Crayola and call it even.", "created_utc": 1700662240, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181a00n/aita_for_canceling_my_own_debt_to_my_brother/", "score": 1499, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His two kids (3 and 6) are generally well-behaved but they're still kids, so I let him know to keep them out of the bonus room (currently half-finished) and my craft room.\n\nYou all know where this is going so I'll just cut to the chase. I came home yesterday to find the kids splayed out on the living room floor surrounded by art supplies in ruined condition. They were finger painting with my gouache and had completely cross-contaminated the colors, drawn on my good watercolor paper with copic markers (completely crushing the tips of the markers as well) and ruined or dirtied several items that my friend had brought me from Korea.\n\nI confronted my brother, who was nonchalantly watching TV, and he told me that he didn't let the kids go in the craft room, he had gone in himself and grabbed them \"just a couple things\" to entertain themselves with. He agreed to buy me replacements until I actually started tallying up the cost\u2014then backtracked and said the price was \"bullshit\" and started insisting that most of the stuff was still in usable condition.\n\nI said fine, you don't have to replace anything, but you can forget about vacation money. He snapped at me not to argue in front of the kids, I said who's arguing? Sounds like the conversation is over.\n\nNow he wants me to pay the vacation money immediately and work out the replacing of the art supplies after. I feel like he's just going to try to haggle me, or is going to replace my stuff with Crayola and call it even.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe have a basket with kid friendly supplies that\u2019s theirs for when they come visit.
