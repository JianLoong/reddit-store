Of course he's going to be somewhat concerned.", "YTA. A week is a long time. It would be understandable if your friend matched with him and said hi before handing it over to you but the first week of your relationship wasn\u2019t even you- it was between your fianc\u00e9 and friend. Definitely weird and you should have told him way earlier out of respect.", "YTA of course your friend thought he knew! It's been five years,  why wouldn't this have come up? Like when people ask how you met,  where was your first date,  etc. The beginning of relationships get discussed a lot so it's ridiculous to claim you forgot. \n\nI can see why he's reeling tbh.  Your friend is the one that swiped right on him.... not you.", "Soft YTA for not telling him on date #1 and before it slipped your mind. I get that it's been five years since your deception.

I do find the phrase \u201ccatfishing\u201d to be harsh as there was no malicious intent when the correspondence started, the worst of the situation is the fact that you didn\u2019t tell him, even after five years.  It\u2019s totally understandable for him to react to the news this way, and you clearly recognize that it hurt him, so as others have said, give him the chance to process this.\n\nYou are right, you\u2019ve been together for five years and from what you say, the two of you seem happy aside from this misstep, so I hope that you\u2019re able to move past this and have the life together that you wanted.", "Yeah YTA.

You have already shown yourself to have lied by omission and this will put some unnecessary and unwanted thoughts in his head about whether he trusts you.\n\nI think you would do well to drop this 'slipped my mind' bollocks, sit down with him and tell him exactly what happened and why and truthfully why you didn't tell him.
