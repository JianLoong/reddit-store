She said to  keep them coming,  as she had downtime to read+reply.  \n\nFor a few days it worked out as planned.  But, I wrote one particularly wrenching update, and she left me on read.    I asked if that was TMI and discomforting.  She replied that she was  too busy but \u201cI catch up when I can.\u201d\n\nSo, the next day, I provide an update with better news. No reply to that.\n\nI\u2019m irritated.

She then said (1) she was hardly ever on her phone with this group of friends and (b) she was very busy for rest of trip.\n\nI was surprised.

I said fair, but then don\u2019t ask me to keep sending updates if you can\u2019t commit to  even a courtesy reply..

I am many years away from middle age.\n\nSo I know what it feels like to be in your shoes.\n\nYou are easily forgiven for being stressed and not wanting to have to type out in detail what is going on. It hurts to relive all the bad details! It hurts more to have someone you thought be a supportive and trustworthy friend just leave it laying at your feet.\n\nStop the updates.

So if you keep asking her, of course she will keep saying yes, keep sending them. Given your friendship, she's likely not comfortable directly telling you \"*yeah I'm busy enjoying myself, don't tell me anything*\", especially with the gravity of the situation.\n\nthat said I don't think anyone is an asshole over this, NAH.", "NAH.\n\nThis is a very emotionally charged subject for all involved. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I would imagine that your friend may not know HOW to respond, as her current experience is such a polar opposite to what you are living through. She might feel that she needs to spend the time to carefully and thoughtfully reply, and hasn\u2019t had that time.\n\nYou are definitely NOT TA, and since you said she is a dear friend, I\u2019d imagine that hasn\u2019t \u2018turned off\u2019 simply because she\u2019s on vacation. She\u2019s being a little careless in not responding to your texts, possibly because she\u2019s trying to take an emotional vacation from the crisis, as well.\n\nShame on her for making up the \u2018away from phone\u2019 excuse, but while misguided, I don\u2019t think that it truly makes her an AH, given the whole context of what you provided.", "If it's bothering you that she isn't replying, I think you need to stop the updates. She can call and ask about your wife if she feels so inclined or when her trip is over. \n\nWhen you live in crisis mode everything is a big deal. This is something you should not spend your emotional energy on. \n\nNTA.", "NAH, and I would personally stop the updates. You never know if she is using your texts as a source of insider knowledge with her other group of friends and that\u2019s why she wants them versus genuinely wanting to be there as support for you and your wife. \n\nThis isn\u2019t meeting your needs and is adding additional unnecessary angst. Stop asking if she wants the updates.  Don\u2019t even communicate you aren\u2019t going to update her anymore.  \nJust stop and put her on mute for the rest of her trip and quit stalking her socials. \n\nI encourage you to seek out some therapy instead as you sound possibly on breaking edge.", "NTA\n\nCondolences for this tragic life event. I wish you strength and peaceful comfort. A friend would understand that any communication from you at this time is very important and a must to reply. \n\nYou offered to abstain from updates while she vacationed, and she declined. She should reply to each update because she made the request. For Pete's sake, this is your wife's life. Your life. A friend would understand the importance of the updates. A friend would understand that updates from you are about you, your wife, and the tragedy you are experiencing. A friend would understand it isn't about them and the time restraints of their vacation. A friend would take time from their vacation to console you over bad news and express joy over good news. A friend would be in the moment for you.\n\nSounds like lip service from this friend.", "NTA\n\nYou are not obligated to send updates. Focus on yourself and your wife. Friend can catch up when they return.", "NTA. My husband is currently in ICU fighting for his life. I give twice daily updates to those who have reached out to me to know. Those who haven't get a generic FB update once every week. I have two priorities right now. Being there for my husband and keeping the home fires burning. Idc about anything else right now. If they *truly* want to know, they'll ask. Making these decisions,  watching your beloved die, is hell. It's overwhelming, exhausting, and terrifying. She might be a friend, but you owe her nothing. For the record, all my friends have responded within two hours.", "I think I\u2019m NAH on this. This is an incredibly difficult time for you and it\u2019s hard to act and react in a way that seems rational for someone on the outside, even a close friend who\u2019s aware of the circumstances. I think your friend probably isn\u2019t viewing the updates the same way you are, possibly due to being kind of inconsiderate or maybe a misunderstanding. She probably does not realize the emotional toll they take on you to write them, which is likely a little naive of her. \n\nYou\u2019re not in the wrong to ask for a quick reply that she\u2019d received the update, but at the same time some folks just don\u2019t text like that. You\u2019re also not totally in the wrong for feeling like you\u2019re spending precious, emotionally exhausting time that isn\u2019t being reciprocated. I am so sorry about what you\u2019re going through right now. \n\nMy read on her behavior is I wonder if she thinks that these are updates you\u2019re copy/pasting to numerous people and would be writing them anyway whether you send them to her or not and she doesn\u2019t want you to just leave her off of the chain because she is out of town. It\u2019s just speculation but I do wonder if she realizes that you\u2019re writing these specifically for her only.\n\nI think she likely wants the information but just like it\u2019s difficult for you to write, it\u2019s certainly way easier and takes less time on her end to post an IG story than to read, take in, and reply to you. I do think a quick \u201cthanks for sending\u201d would be much more considerate than nothing. My guess is that she probably wants real-time info in case something really big happens that she needs to immediately respond to, but otherwise plans to catch up all at once. I would slow down/cut back on the updates if I were you.", "I also have stage four cancer. One of my best friends completely ghosted me after my diagnosis and even told a mutual friend that she could only update her husband because it is too overwhelming for her to read on her own. I think for some people it is just far too overwhelming to process. \nWhat I would do is set up a caring bridge website where you can update everyone at the same time. That way, people who can handle it can read, and those who can\u2019t won\u2019t. Either way, you won\u2019t be constantly reaching out. Im so sorry for what you are going through.", "I would never say y. T. A.  to someone in your situation. But I think you\u2019re taking it out on her the pain and anguish you\u2019re feeling about your wife. If you want to send updates, send them, knowing that she may not read them if you want to stop I think that\u2019s fine too.", "I hate to tell someone who is going through something so difficult that they were the asshole but....  YTA.\n\nYou ***are*** in crisis mode and I think you hitched your comfort to this friend who is not responsible for your emotional duress.  \n\nThe first time she didn't respond I would have stopped sending updates until she asked for one.  \n\nHear yourself... you are calculating everything she's doing online and watching for \"read\" and building a case for her lack of care... all the while your wife is there facing the end of her life and you are there trying to cope with that.  I think this may just be giving you something else to pay attention to but it's not productive for you or anyone, really.\n\nFind another outlet that's healthy for you. Glad to see you're seeing a therapist.", "NAH. There was not a meeting of the minds here on what \u201dupdate\u201d meant. You interpreted it as maintaining an ongoing dialogue, you expected  a \u2018two way street\u2019 as you said above. But your friend anticipated a succinct update, no reply needed, like one would get an update on the news or weather channel. imho, you overreacted due to your stress.", "Realistically, does every update require a response?\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s doing anything to be malicious. There is a big difference between uploading a photo to Instagram that takes a couple of seconds versus replying to a text and potentially keeping up a conversation that can last a lot longer.\n\nPeople keep saying to stop sending updates. I think the opposite. Keep sending them but stop expecting back-and-forth, and if they are draining you, then keep them simple to avoid having to go into what you\u2019ve described as harrowing. A simple, \u201cToday was a bad one, hoping for better results tomorrow,\u201d could be a better solution for now till she has returned and is able to properly respond. It means she\u2019s still updated, it doesn\u2019t require a response, and you\u2019re not having to go through the details.\n\nI\u2019m assuming when she\u2019s not on vacation, she\u2019s more attentive? So your frustration and reaction to this seems to be excessive:\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t think it was worth the time\u201d, that is an assumption you\u2019ve made whilst knowing she\u2019s busy and stretched thin for time and energy for all of these spaces. It doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t care and it\u2019s unkind to paint that picture of someone who otherwise has been very involved.", "YTA. Sorry, but I think you are taking her not replying right away way too personally. I understand that you are having a hard time - can't even imagine what you are going through and you have all my sympathy - but there is HUGE difference between posting a pic or story on Insta - easily done while out with said friends or roaming around, only takes a minute or two - and replying to an emotionally taxing text - something I would hold off on until I was alone and in the right frame of mind to address. Consider also that your updates may be upsetting for her as well, and she may not know how to respond to them.\n\nIf this is truly causing so much hurt for you, then stop giving her updates so you can stop obsessing over her lack of replies.", "Dude, you're in pain right now. And I'm sorry for that  losing a loved one, words can't express that adequately. \n\nAnd sending this encapsulated messages of what's been happening, but its ignored by someone on vacation would be enraging.\n\nBut she's ... a friend. And not a very close one, because a close friend would be there right now. A moderately concerned friend.\n\nShe would have no idea of how hard this is hitting you and how much it costs you to write to her.\n\nNot writing any further is a good idea. The only people you should be spending you energy on is your wife and yourself, barring other grieving family.\n\nNAH", "I don't get how you think you are TAH, you are living in a crisis.

She wants the informations but doesn't think it's important that she replies to every update. I can understand that but she kind of framed it like she would reply. You are burdened with writing the updates. It's entirely possible that she thinks you send updates to multiple people and just copy/paste. Not everyone knows how much work \"just\" copy/paste is in a situ like this.

And a real friend will understand that you're going through hell, crisis mode as you say. Give yourself permission to be selfish during this time. It's not actually selfish in reality, but it may feel that way if you're used to trying to please other people. Your real friends should be bending over backwards to make sure you're ok. That's not always realistic but it's how it should be. It sucks to learn that a lot of people just don't know how to act right when someone is going through a tragedy.

But that\u2019s water under the bridge.  \n\nAnyhow, will take what\u2019s left of the high road and send succinct, matter of fact updates about my wife, since I did offer/promise to do so as long as I can do so with minimal strain.  For reasons you astutely noted I just have to write this person/friendship off and make sure to avoid mistakes with others.  Not going to beat myself up about it anymore but do have to make sure I learn from this.", "Yeah.  Maybe the solution is that I just say, sorry can\u2019t do it this way.", "Yes.  Or even \u201cno time to read this now, but am not forgetting.\u201d\n\nBut, I was not without my own failures here and all I can do is work on myself.", "WTF is wrong with you.  He is not in complete control. He's about to lose it and he's looking to interact with those people who are there to support him, not just suck him dry emotionally so they can feel better about themselves for \"checking\" on a \"friend.\"   He isn't letting it continue. He stopped it.  Can you even read?", "Just stop sending them and see if she even bothers to ask.  Will tell you a lot about someone.", "Obviously you can't read.  I stated he is in control of the situation of sending updates to the friend.  If the process of doing that and not receiving a reply is not something he wants to do then he should stop doing it but he should not make a huge deal out of it.  Simply stop sending updates to the friend and if they are truly a friend then they will ask what is going on.  If they do not then I guess they aren't really a friend and he will be better off without them.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is always amazing when the OP replies in a civil manner but others reply with WTF reeeeeeeeeeeee.  Sorry my opinion differed from yours but that is how life works.  Have a nice day."]}
