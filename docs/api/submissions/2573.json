{"id": 2573, "submission_id": "yxykdl", "title": "AITA for excluding my roommate from a \u201cdinner date\u201d with her brother?", "selftext": "My (24/F) roommate\u2019s brother (Jack, 30/M) has been staying at our apartment for the last couple of weeks because he just broke up with his girlfriend. My roommate (Becky, 25/F) has been pretty stressed out by having him around, I don\u2019t fully understand why because in my opinion he\u2019s been fine to live with, but based on what she said this morning I feel like this is relevant background information.\n\nSo last night when I got home, Jack told me that Becky had called him and said that she had to stay late at work and he was on his own for dinner. He said that he was thinking that instead of ordering take-out (which is what we usually do) he was going to cook something, and he asked me if I wanted to come to the grocery store with him to help him pick out ingredients and decide what to make. I thought that sounded fun so I said yes.\n\nJack and I walked to the store, got groceries, came home and cooked dinner, and then we were sitting at the table together eating (instead of on the couch which is more normal for our apartment) when Becky got home from work.\n\nBecky got upset that we \u201cdeliberately waited until the one night that she couldn\u2019t join us\u201d to make a nice meal and said that it really hurt her feelings that we were excluding her and having a \u201cdinner date\u201d without her. Then she went in our room and locked the door and ignored me for the rest of the night when I wanted to come in, so I ended up having to sleep on the couch.\n\nSo this morning I tried to apologize to Becky and I explained that I was just going along with Jack\u2019s idea to make dinner and that I didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d feel left out. She said that of course Jack suggested we make dinner because he was obviously hitting on me, but I\u2019m supposed to be her friend and so I should\u2019ve thought about how she\u2019d feel instead of just going along with whatever Jack wanted to do. She also said that when she told Jack he was on his own for dinner she only meant Jack, otherwise she would\u2019ve texted me the same thing.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1668712044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxykdl/aita_for_excluding_my_roommate_from_a_dinner_date/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also she's literally never been this mad at me before and she's usually more reasonable than this so I feel like I really might've done something wrong here.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Shutting you out of your room is unfair. But out of curiosity, if you had to sleep on the couch where was the brother sleeping? Is she perhaps annoyed because his presence means he's also forcing the two of you to share a room?\n\nHer brother may be interested in you but it seems like you didn't even notice...", "NTA \n\nAnd there's no way I would have slept on the couch, I'd have kicked the door in first.", "NTA. You had no way of knowing what your roommate's feelings about that would be, and even if he was hitting on you, so what? That is certainly not a reason to flip like that on you and keep you from sleeping in your own bed.", "\"She also said that when she told Jack he was on his own for dinner she only meant Jack, otherwise she would\u2019ve texted me the same thing\"\n\nExcuse me, what? That's just an unhinged thing to say. And keeping you out of YOUR room is unacceptable. I agree with other commenters that I'd have kicked the door in at that point. Confrontational? Yes but she needs it. She clearly has some history with her brother and you're getting tossed in the middle of it (made worse that from the post Jack seems pretty chill). My flippant response is to kick out (or leave yourself) Becky and hang out more with Jack but may not be the best advice... but she's being really weird here and keeping you out of YOUR room is absolutely unacceptable.   \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If she invited Jack to stay in your apartment, you\u2019re free to treat him exactly as you would any other roommate.", "That's.... Insecure as hell but ok", "NTA\n\nBecky's feelings are valid and it would be no AHs if it was just the conversation. However her actions of locking you out of your bedroom make her TA.", "NTA-Becky\u2019s behaviour was not a normal response.  You didn\u2019t need to explain your need to eat or your kind gesture to prepare a nice cooked meal with Jack. I definitely wouldn\u2019t have been sleeping on the couch. If I couldn\u2019t get in the room to sleep in my own bed, I would\u2019ve been in Jack\u2019s and the next day, I would have ripped Becky a new one and told her to grow tf up.", "Are you and your roommate in some sort of relationship? Why are you sharing a room? Where did Jack sleep if you slept on the couch? Did she bring home dinner when she came?\n\nI still have so many questions but NTA you and Jack were just having dinner.", "NTA \n\nHas Becky ever suggested the two (or three) of you making dinner instead of getting takeout? Are each of you responsible for your own food? We're you supposed to wait for her to return to have dinner?\n\nI don't see why she should feel left out if she knew of her brother's attraction towards you. I think that would make the \"dinner date\" awkward if the date part was Jack's intention.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Your roommate is really immature.  She locked you out?  After she was the one who let her brother stay.", "NTA But i guess it is time that the brother moves out again. I mean does he even look after places when he stays there for week? Like a room to rent? Or does he have friend where he can stay? Your roommate hates the situation how it is now. And when he really tries to hit on you, it isn't good if he stays there.", "From Becky\u2019s pov, it must be gross to see your brother hitting on your friend/roommate WHILE living in the same space. I can understand why she\u2019d feel uncomfortable by the situation. But I would have an adult conversation with her and tell her that locking you out of the room is inexcusable.", "NTA could Becky have a crush on you?", "Becky is using magical thinking.  You should magically know her thoughts and expectations. \n\nBecky has not developed a high degree of emotional intelligence. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  She told Jack he was on his own.  You were on your own.  He made a suggestion and you agreed.  She is being weirdly jealous about this.  Does your roommate have a crush on you or something?  Making you sleep on the couch is not ok.  It really sounds like Jack would be a better roommate than Becky.", "What was this \"super romantic dinner date\" food? I'm genuinely curious.", "Why don\u2019t you have your own room is really my only concern in this story because where is Jack sleeping anyway? Or is he sleeping in her room and she locked you out of YOUR bedroom? Either way NTA but this seems like a weird situation", "She is the asshole if her brother doesn\u2019t pay rent( and make yours less) and he\u2019s the reason why you\u2019re sharing the same bedroom with your roommate. But you\u2019re not an asshole for making dinner when she\u2019s at work.", "Nta, sound like Becky needs therapy. Soujd like she LIKES her brother,jealousy.", "NTA\n\nShe seems just stressed with this situation with her brother. I would apologize and end it there. Also, don't have much interaction with her brother.\n\nIt seems out of proportion but with siblings it's always a weird line and they always seem to pass each other off but not other people.", "NTA\u2026. \n\nis your roomie into you?", "That\u2019s what I was wondering.", ">From Becky\u2019s pov, it must be gross to see your brother hitting on your friend/roommate WHILE living in the same space. \n\n\nNo. Why will it be gross? How?", "NTA.  Becky and Jack like the same person.", "NTA. She is possessive of her brother and felt left out. Even if you try to understand her feelings, locking you out of the room is not acceptable. Time to move out.", "NTA. And excluding Jack from her plans was ok?", "MIL troll branching out to be the SIL troll.  Solid for a first effort, 7.5/10.", "I also have the exact same questions", "This is a suggestion cause I can't see OP commenting anything as of yet in the thread, but I figured that roommate and OP have separate rooms and roommate gave up a room to brother, thus OP and friend sharing a room. \n\nI could be completely wrong though, so if OP elaborates or I see something otherwise, I'll edit based on that", "I legit think Becky and her brother both have a thing for OP which is causing the friction.", "OP wrote a comment in response to mine but deleted it before I could read it. \n\nAnd if the room was OP\u2019s then the roommate was beyond wrong for locking her out of it.", "Ooohhhhh, I'll definitely be on the lookout for a comment explaining then\n\nAnd I am in total agreement that if it was OP's room it was extremely wrong to lock her out."]}
