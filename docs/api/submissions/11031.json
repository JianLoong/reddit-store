We\u2019ve been asked a lot of times when we\u2019re getting married, and we always said we\u2019re happy together and that we don\u2019t need a wedding or any paper that says what we are. \n\nMy best friend (33M) and me have been best mates since kindergarten. We are part of a very close group of friends, but we were the only 2 who attended higher education and shared a lot of interests that the rest of our friends were not interested in. \n\nA couple of months ago my and my gf decided to get legally married so we could use the paid vacation days to travel, and be prepared for when we decide to have children.

I was upset for the rest of the dinner and a couple of people asked if I was okay and I said I was and then said to my gf that I\u2019d rather go home than go to the bar with the rest. I wasn\u2019t even mad about he not coming to the party until I heard that conversation. He\u2019s always been self-centered\n\nHe yesterday texted me if I was up for a couple of beers.

If you truly had this close friendship for all those years then what you should do is apologize to your buddy there, both for how you were feeling at the time and how you reacted later. Moving forward, realize that being non-confrontational puts you at risk for having your feeling disregarded.", "YTA. OP, you planned a strange event. Your friends were excluded from the lunch, then you were having a casual get together where they were invited. At no point did you communicate this was an important occasion, and in truth the plain clothes dress code sends a strong message that it isn\u2019t important!\n\nFurther, if this was a wedding, it was as though your friend was not invited to the actual wedding (the lunch) but was welcomed to enjoy a less important gathering. Not saying he felt this way, but he could have felt snubbed for this. \n\nYou\u2019ve planned this in a confusing way, so it\u2019s easy to misunderstand your intent.

If you wanted this to be treated as a wedding (a once-in-a-lifetime event that should be prioritized in social calendars), then call it a wedding.\n\nAdditionally, I think you\u2019re reacting in a pretty childish way by blocking your friend.

This is petty and you will regret it I'm sure", "YTA and so determined to not have a wedding, but you want your friends and family to treat it as special, but you're not, but they should make it a priority, but you're not. \n\nYour friend obviously assumes you don't need him to celebrate a piece of paper which you've probably told him a million times already means nothing.", "YTA\n\nYou told your friend that it was fine that he wasn't going to attend your 'non-wedding', but really you weren't ok with it and expected him to read your mind, so you blocked him everywhere as a response. Mature.\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019ll it\u2019s not a wedding...\n\nHe's repeating your words - verbatim - yet he's self-centred? What?\n\nIt sounds to me like you've been frustrated at this guy and have been searching for an excuse to go scorched earth on him for some time. Using your big boy words is scary sometimes, but you're going to discover quite quickly that always choosing this path isn't going to get you far in life. You really should've done something about the clear frustration you have with your friend long ago instead of stewing and behaving in a way that even your fianc\u00e9e thinks is over the top.\n\nI hope for her sake that you manage to figure out how to communicate like an adult before you get married. She's in for a hell of a time with you otherwise.", ">\u201cmaybe you should ask [soccer player] if he\u2019s up for that\u201d\n\n\nSorry, it sounds like something a teenager would say. \n\nNot only that sentence, but this whole situation you created is very immature. The adult thing to do is to communicate your feelings and expectations. Also, just make up your mind: is it or isn't a wedding? You do want or you don't want to be the center of attention that day?\n\nJust be clear with yourself and others\n\nYTA", "NTA- your feelings are understandable, it may not be the regular wedding but you still expected the people you're close to attend the dinner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Instead of saying \u201cactually this is really important to me and I really want you to be there\u201d you said \u201cthat\u2019s fine\u201d. Look, I get it to a degree. I hate contradicting people or confrontation too. But after the fact you could have messaged him to tell him how you felt, rather than ghosting him? You can\u2019t expect people to know how you feel if you never tell them.", ">he has traveled to attend other peoples weddings and bachellor parties,\n\nbut you made clear that this was a \"non-wedding\"", "Honestly you could have called it something else other than a non-wedding as to me that indicates it\u2019s just a party/ dinner. You could have called it your reception as technically that isn\u2019t incorrect as you are getting married. \n\nWords are important as it gives an idea to a person whether it can be optional or not. You could have also been honest to your best friend as well with how you felt. This isn\u2019t worth throwing your friendship away as he has done nothing wrong.\n\nMaybe you could plan something else with him to celebrate like a couple of beers and a meal but you have to let your feelings/ grudge go.\n\nYou did create this situation not him.", "It's the lack of communication on your part and jumping directly to blocking him that make YTA\n\nBeing upset about him not attending is fine.\n\nAnd you aren't \"non-confrontational\", you are a person who has not developed health adult communication skills!\n\nDid it ever occur to you that blocking him actually removes his opportunity to apologise and make it up to you?", "You then subsequently said it was okay if he missed.  All you had to do at the moment was ask him to come to your ridiculously named event. Like I said 100% on you.", "You're non-confrontational until you go scorched earth on people, make passive-aggressive swipes at them and then block them from being able to contact you again?  \n\nThat's called cowardice, my dude, and repeatedly choosing that path isn't going to get you far in life. A simple 'Hey, I'm disappointed that you're ditching my wedding for a soccer game with only two weeks notice. What's up with that?' isn't spoiling for a fight. It's clearly communicating your feelings and giving him a chance to rectify.", "Then that is on you, not your now ex-friend. \n\nYou said it wasn't a wedding and gave the impression it wasn't important and are now upset that that is how they are treating it.\n\nSure, ghosting a 'best friend' is easier than communicating with them.  To be honest, if I was your soon to be spouse this would make me concerned with how you would deal with any issues/expectations/communication in the future.", "Not that many places, actually - it\u2019s been phased out in most places because it\u2019s bad for the legal system when there isn\u2019t a clear, simple test for whether someone is married.  Also common law takes more than that: you have to specifically present yourself to the world as spouses, not as boyfriend/girlfriend/partner/etc.", "In my country it just makes it a lot of easier to sign the papers, for things like kids, medical stuff....\n\nwe didn't want a fanfare, just to have a dinner with our close friends.", "you are getting married.... it's a wedding", "It is a wedding, and if you want people to treat is as an important event, stop making up new terms for it", ">the importance he gives to our friendship.\n\nMy guy, you're the one who insisted that this is a \"non-wedding, we don't like being the center of attention\" kind of day.  Why would you expect anyone to make you the center of attention when you've gone out of your way to clarify that you don't want that (except that you apparently DO want that)?", "You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions here. It seems that you have been downplaying the importance of this event - it\u2019s a non-wedding, no big deal, casual. He takes that at face-value and figures you won\u2019t miss him if he\u2019s not there. You then cut him out of your life without so much as a \u201cmate, this is actually really important to me, and I\u2019m hurt that you\u2019ve decided not to come.\u201d If you\u2019re going to throw away a life-long friendship without having the maturity and courage to even talk to your friend about it, then that\u2019s on you, not him.", "It doesn't confirm that at all!\n\nWhat it confirms is that your friend misunderstood the importance of this event to you.\n\nIf you communicated that it was actually really important to you for him to be there and upset you of he won't be, instead of blocking him, I guarantee he would be apologetic and try to make it up to you.", "Probably should have told him that at the time. He is not a mind reader.", "But that's too haaarrdd. OP would rather just sit and marinate in his misery or something.", "that's why I also mentioned bachellor parties.", "We don't have receptions in our culture. Either it is a wedding or not.", "I guess it's my fault for being non confrontational.", "I may be telling him that. Thank you.", "Then tell your friend that.", "It may be a cultural thing... in spain a wedding is when you go to church or whatever and do a ceremony.", "Would anything change? He already took the decision, he wasn't asking.", "How you gon' have a bachelor party for a non-wedding?\n\nLookit, you either want to be the center of attention like a bride & groom typically are or you don't.  This whole \"non-wedding, no big deal, hate being the center of attention except that we TOTALLY want to be the center of attention\" bit is why you're in your current predicament.", "Pretty much.", "I suggest you add in an apology for flying off the handlebars.", "that's what we told him and the others when we invited them to it.", "Yes, things are different when we communicate. You said it wasn't a big deal and he trusted you to be honest. You can still save this friendship by communicating. He isn't the one that's wrong here.", "What I'm trying to tell you is that he gets out of his way to attend this events even if they are not official weddings.
