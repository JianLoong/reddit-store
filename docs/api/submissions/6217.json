For some context, she was living with me, she did not have a steady job, she was paying no rent, and was basically just a long-term house guest. I was fine with this as she was only 18 and still trying to get her life together and I am happy to help out where I can. However she and I both suffer from very intense anxiety disorders, I started seeing a therapist a couple of years ago and have been improving steadily ever since. After she moved in I started realizing that her anxiety was borderline paranoia, she refuses to touch doorknobs because she doesn't want to get a shock, she won't talk to any strangers at all including waiters and employees, she refuses to leave the house without me, she set up a camera in our living room to check up on the cats and make sure our house does not spontaneously catch on fire, we can't go to any public places because she thinks someone is out to get her, she doesn't feel safe anywhere, etc. \n\nThis became such a big part of our lives that she was having a meltdown over something practically every day. I realized how much distress she was in and started suggesting that she see a therapist but she refused, she claims she doesn't need a therapist because she is being \"perfectly reasonable\", I've tried to tell her that she doesn't seem healthy or happy but she won't listen, she doesn't want to get better. Having her around is basically starting to feel like a second job, plus it's not helping my mental health at all, I'm always annoyed or tense to the point where my friends have started to point it out. After two years of this non-stop paranoia and nonchalant attitude she had, I simply could not have her as a roommate anymore. So I gave her an ultimatum and told her that she had to get a therapist or move out. She was infuriated with me but she decided to move out. A week later I got a call from my mother, apparently, my sister had moved back home and my parents were pissed at me. Telling me I was being a bad sister, that I was older and it was my job to look after her. I tried to explain that I tried to get her help, which she denied. But they wouldn't hear any of it, they said I was just being cruel. It's been weighing on my mind ever since.

Your ultimatum was perfectly reasonable(unlike the stuff she does and doesnt that she calls \"perfectly reasonable\")\n\n\nIt was awesome that you wanted to help, but you cant do it with your own health's expense. Your sister needs professional help, and as long as she herself doesnt believe that she does, she Will only get worse and you accommodating to that is in no way helpful.\n\nAlso, your Mother is an asshole too for trying to guilt you.

You gave her a very kind ultimatum. She refuses to get help. She is not being reasonable.\n\nBut you're going to be the AH to her and to your parents. They just don't want to deal with her either, I would suspect.", "NTA, it is NOT your job to look after your sister. It really is your sister's job to look after herself at this age, and if she cannot, responsibility falls back to the parents imo. Don't feel bad, you tried and did everything you could to get her well, but if people do not want to be helped, it just won't work. You were right to choose yourself. Happy New Year.", "NTA, your parents are just exhausted as you are and they are guilting you into thinking that it\u2019s your responsibility.", "Tell your parents she's not your Kid, she's your Sister. They are responsible for taking care of their own kid.", "NTA. Mental health is really hard to deal with, especially when the other person refuses to get help. At some point, it's on them to get help. That said, I don't think your sister is an asshole either - she just has a mental health issue which, ironically, makes it hard for her to get help. It's simply sad. Your parents, though, are assholes. Maybe they can't deal with the sister either - that's fine, but to say that you have obligation to room and board her? That's ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\nI really feel for your sister, as I know how difficult it can be to manage your mental health, but she is refusing to seek help, and could potentially undermine all of the progress you've made in your own therapy. Being unable to talk to strangers or go to a public place goes beyond paranoia, it makes it impossible for her to be an independent person, and she is putting the pressure of being a de-facto caretaker on you, way beyond the typical level of \"siblings looking after each other\". Your parents are also only unhappy because now THEY have to deal with her anxiety disorder that she is unwilling or unable to treat.", "NTA.\n\nPlease allow me to comment on each point I felt the need to respond to....\n\n1. First, my congratulations on your hard work to address your issues; it really is true that acceptance is the first step to resolution, but what nobody tells us is just how hard that first step can be.\n2. Your sister's issues are her own, and are her responsibility to either address, indulge, or ignore; you can only do so much, and it appears that you did everything you could, based upon what you wrote in your post.\n3. As for your parents' argument that it is your responsibility to take care of her as you're the big sister, all I can do is call 'bullshit' on that! In fact, it is **their** responsibility, as her parents, to take care of her; what they are attempting to do is nothing less than an abrogation of their parental responsibilities - if they wanted to wash their hands of the whole thing, they'd be jerks, but within their rights (as she is, technically, an adult). Attempting to gaslight you into taking on those duties, however, is where the abrogation truly occurred.\n\nSo, if my advice means anything, I'd recommend focusing on your continued growth, development, and improvement in 2023...and leave your sister, her issues, and your parents all to themselves.", "NTA. You did look out after her for a long time and she needs help from a professional. You tried to get her this help, but she refused.", "Lol. Mom and dad don\u2019t want to deal with her either.  They just mad because now they have to. NTA. Stand your ground. Don\u2019t move her back in or you\u2019ll be ruining your own mental health.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister is in dire need of help and your parents are enabling and blaming instead of focusing on the real issue.", "NTA.

They're just guilt tripping her because they don't want to look like bad parents for not wanting to deal with another grown adult. You shouldn't be throwing parental responsibilities on your children. In all honesty this really is a situation where as a family you all should admit her to a psych ward. Those people are literally educated in this area and can keep her alive if she really has those problems and it hinders her from actually living life and not getting food or doing things for herself. I never like the idea of the psych ward but it really helps you guys get a better understanding of diagnoses and how to deal with them properly.", "I was thinking the same... Sounds like psychosis.

The most compassionate thing you can do right now is what you've already done.  You have pointed out that she is not living in consensus reality.  You have told her, and shown her, that professional help is effective.  She has chosen not to do the hard work of changing something that she is used to--something that works for her *because she has been depending on you to allow her to do her dysfunctional things.*  And so, it's time for a reality check.
