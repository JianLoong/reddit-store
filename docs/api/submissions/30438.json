Elizabeth was born with a whole host of medical issues and disabilities. From the time she was born it was known she would need someone else to look after her. They had no other kids and realized a couple of years in that someone would need to take care of her when they were too old or gone. So they decided another kid, someone who was born to be her caregiver, was a good idea, and then I was born.\n\nI knew my whole life what my parents intended for me to do and I was trained to take care of her from a young age. I could care for my sister before I even started school and my parents did their best to keep me from getting an education. But that was, thankfully, not allowed to happen, and even though I sucked at school for several years I saw school as a refuge from home.\n\nI wasn't loved at home. I was there to serve a purpose, an employee, and nothing more. It was miserable. I felt like I never really mattered. My parents only cared about Elizabeth's welfare. Mine wasn't even secondary because they put themselves before me too. They told me Elizabeth was their daughter and I was her caregiver in training. They also told me they had no obligation to me, just Elizabeth. Because she is their daughter, their \"real daughter\".\n\nI started planning my escape a year ago. It was when friends convinced me I deserved better and should have a life. I never got to see them outside of school but they stood by me. They even got together and bought me a phone so I could talk to them while I was home.\n\nI never told my parents I would leave once I turned 18. I also never told them I was planning to further my education. They had pressured me for years to drop out at 16. But I was able to work on my grades and do good enough that I can focus on work now and get money together so I can attend community college next year.\n\nBefore I left I told my parents that their plan for me failed and they better hope they can figure out something else for Elizabeth's long term care, because I would not take responsibility. I will not be tied down forever. They were yelling at me as I left and since they did find out about the phone after my friends gave it to me and they did take my number, they have told me I am the worst kind of person there is. They said I was selfish, evil, that I turned my back on poor Elizabeth, that I had a job to do and fuck me for not. All kinds of stuff like that. They said if something happens to them in the morning Elizabeth is screwed and it will be all my fault.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699278850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p383v/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_their_plan/", "score": 1186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
