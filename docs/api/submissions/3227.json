I\u2019ve met what she calls her \u201cleather family\u201d about five times now. About as frequently as I see some of my own chosen family and more frequently than I see my own family, tbh. \n\nShe tells me that they saved her from unsafe BDSM situations and accept her for who she is. So it\u2019s important I get along with them. They are like chosen family to her. I get that. But each time I hang out with them I get creepy vibes from them. Supposedly they are all queer and trans, but I feel myself explaining things about misogyny, consent, and power I shouldn\u2019t have to explain. They are also all much much older than her (we are in our 20s and they are mostly in their 50s.) They all have sex with one another at kink parties. And get mad at me (and her) for me not going to these meet ups or parties. I\u2019ve tried to politely say they aren\u2019t my type. Then my girlfriend calls me \u201cPrincess\u201d for having \u201ctoo high of standards.\u201d \n\nThey also talk too much about blood, piercings, and violence for me to withstand time around them. I wish I wasn\u2019t this sensitive. I\u2019m trying not to be. But one just kept talking about the blood/pus issues he had after top surgery at the bar. My girlfriend mentioned at one get together that we will be trying to get married and get pregnant. At this get together, people in the leather family suggested that she use her ex (who is a cis guy in the leather family) to donate sperm. When I said no, I\u2019m uncomfortable. They then offered the sperm of two other men in the leather family. I once again said I was uncomfortable. My girlfriend doesn\u2019t see the problem. She thinks they are being helpful and I don\u2019t accept her as she is. \n\nFor context, I go to my girlfriends bio family house. I plan vacations with them and I try my best to get along with them. I am friends with her friends outside of this leather family, but lately she has isolated herself from all of those people. This all escalated when this holiday season I didn\u2019t want to go to her leather families Thanksgiving. She isn\u2019t talking to me right now. I feel like a terrible boyfriend.

But looks to me like you are wasting a lot of time & effort on a basically incompatible situation. Your partner & her pals are showing you who they really are so believe them. You won't come first with your partner, you won't be helped to feel safe, and it's going to get worse not better over the years. \n\nThese unsafe folks will be physically handling your babies as they grow up, will you be okay with that? I wouldn't.", "NTA- \n\nYou're not required to like your partners friends/chosen family... In the same way that your not required to like your partners bio family or other friends... \n\nBut it's worth asking yourself if she's like really into the things they say and you're really not into it... Then are you compatible... Because not only is she on board with their comments, she endorses and defends the stuff they say around and to you. \n\nIt also sounds like your girlfriend is non monogamous but she is monogamous because she's will you? Like the play time references and group sex that you both don't attend anymore, it sounds like they are kind of like a big group unit that used to play together and now no longer do.\n\nThe fact that she degrades you on a way you aren't into (i don't know if you all are into kink) by calling you princess when she's around them is big flags. She is super into that environment. She says that she really is down with it. She's telling you that's who she is. And if you're like 'dont ever want to be around them' than i really question if you really should be around her... Because that's who she is? She's the person who makes fun of you for saying no to sex or play with people you don't want to play with or have sex with... And that's gross behavior.", "NTA it sounds like gf is being pulled back into another unhealthy group of people but she's blind to it because she sees them as her saviors.", "NTA. Run.", "Nta, you two do not seem compatible. I can tell you clearly like this woman but she is asking you to do many things you are not comfortable with. You both each deserve a partner with the same goals and wants in life.", "NTA and definitely bail now or brace for impact cause this rekationship us going to crash hard", "NTA- As hard as this is, you should break up with her. She and her friend-family shouldn't be trying to pressure you into sexual situations and their behavior has been very anti-social. That won't improve after marriage.", "NTA \n\nIt also sounds like she's taking her bad experience that this leather family helped her through or what not and is trying to recreate it with someone else just with her as the aggressor instead of the victim. \n\nShe's being transphobic by calling you princess. She's bullying you in front of these people and unless she has kink for that type of thing then that's something BOTH people consent to. \n\nIt also sounds like this leather family doesn't know what consent is just because they spend so much time together. Also like other people have said consent is a big issue in the BDSM community if you don't consent then it's a big no no to do what they haven't given you consent for. \n\nSo like I said if you didn't like this bullying she does in front of people and it's one of her kinks and she never asked for your consent then she shouldn't be in the BDSM community. Also as she is female she should understand the whole consent issue.", "You're NTA, but it does sound like you and your girlfriend aren't compatible, at least over these issues. It sounds like you've tried to accept her other family  (can't say leather family. It makes me think of leather gloves that are alive), but you've found your limits. That's okay, just as it's okay that she has hers. You both need to find a way to manage both of your viewpoints or separate, as it doesn't sound like she's willing to compromise.", "NTA.\nI won't pretend to know much about BDSM or Polygamous relationships because they don't make much sense in my mind. But I do know that they have strict rules and boundaries, and yours are being either ignored, or willfully trampled on. This isn't a relationship I'd continue to be honest, you don't feel safe, comfortable or entirely welcomed by these people and that will not change. Your GFs behaviour is concerning also.", "Dude, you\u2019re not crazy. These people are boundary stomping weirdos. They pressure you to have sex with them, nonconsensually involve you in their dynamic, get in the middle of you and your girlfriend\u2019s reproductive choices, engage in transphobic microaggressions (Princess) and mock you for having reasonable boundaries. And your girlfriend, instead of backing you up, joins them in trying to tear you down. She stops talking to you for very reasonably going \u201chey this is fucked up\u201d. \n\nI know you want something that will fix this, but I don\u2019t think it can be fixed. Your girlfriend has chosen her group of enmeshed weirdos over you. She\u2019s made it clear that the price of being a priority in her life is to make her group a priority in yours. That\u2019s a shitty fucking price. It\u2018s time to let her go. NTA.", "NTA. And this is pretty obviously a relationship that is almost certainly destined to not work out. It really does sound like you and your partner have some major incompatibility issues. You shouldn't have to keep pushing yourself to be okay with things that make you uncomfortable and your partner should validate your feelings instead of belittling you for them. Also, for the record, I think that it's pretty reasonable to find people who get angry at you and your partner for not attending their kink parties creepy - that's weird on their part.", "Run away my dear. Run away. You are so nta here, and this is very concerning :(", "NTA Not for me to say but from the description, you don't sound compatible.\n\nAs for explaining things like misogyny: rules and expectations around gender have changed drastically these past years.  While you've grown up with them, it's likely the 50-something leather family are having to work their way through modernising their viewpoints.", "NTA.  Wait.  You said you want to have children, and they offered a couple of people to get her pregnant? And you are on here wondering if you are out of line? You say that makes you uncomfortable? How about no fucking way?    Sweet summers child.  You aren\u2019t in Kansas any more.  And you seem really passive about it.  Either you are all in for this life or all out.  I don\u2019t think you can navigate a middle ground here.  That she didn\u2019t shut it down right away tells you where she is.", "NTA\n\nShe was their \u201cunicorn\u201d as it\u2019s called and they perceive you as taking her away from them, while also declining their advances. So they\u2019re doubly offended. If you were going to take their unicorn, they would have wanted you to join as a consolation prize.\n\nThe lot is weird. Your gf is weird for thinking this is okay.", "NTA I am getting strong gut sensation that you are not safe with her friends and she would go along with anything they chose to do and do nothing to protect you. If you weren't in love her, your gut would have been screaming at first meeting to get the hell out of there. Honey, your gf is not your one.", "NTA leave her and don't have kids with her, PLEASE!", "This\u2026. sounds like a cult. Like a full on cult. And you need to run and run fast.", "NTA.  You need to leave for reasons even beyond the kink stuff. Good BDSM etiquette emphasizes real consent. Additionally If she wants to spend money on leather but not on stuff for the house that's a problem", "NTA, but honestly it sounds like you need to really sit down and look at this relationship and ask if you're really compatible. It sounds like you two have incompatible life structures, as well as kinks", "NTA for so many reasons, but I have to ask (hypothetically mostly)\nWhy the hell would they think suggesting anything about anyone donating sperm was okay in that situation (or at all they don't really know you and are inconsiderate enough to not care that they make you very uncomfortable talking about the infections they got after surgeries)", "NTA. Like others have said-I think you need to accept that you and your girlfriend aren't compatible. Do you really want to deal with and compete with this \"leather family\" your entire life?", "Nta. But not taking care of yourself either. \n\nThey are trying to isolate her. This is a bunch of 50 yr old sexy friends that brought a 20 yr old into the mix. They are having fun and want to keep her. It is her kink, so she is happy for now. \n\nShe also wants a separate life it seems. She wants a home with a man and a baby, normal relations with her family. \n\nNone of that is surprising. I don't knock her for that. But she has also made it clear that she wants a man to also be a part of her leather family. You do not seem to want that for yourself at all. \n\nSo you would basically be betraying yourself and your own needs if you attempt to join the family to meet hers. She will not be happy in the relationship if you don't join the family. \n\nWhy are you considering having children with her? Because she said so? Is that a reason to bring a child into the world? Are you going to be okay with leather family helping raise your kid?\n\nThis is real. It is not all going to go away when she gets pregnant. You and she want different things in life. In bed, at least. \n\nIf you are interested and excited by her kink, and just want to go down that path slowly, maybe stay in the relationship.  If you have no interest, get out now. If you don't, you will end up with a baby that you are sharing custody with, and watching be 1/2 raised at a leather family house. \n\nEscape while you can!", "NTA. Those people are odd. Just note that these are the type of people she hangs with before planning family or wedding, could be a red flag. The sperm donor thing is pretty wtf", "Run.", "Sounds like she\u2019s not for you but nta yet to answer your question.

Why are you subjecting yourself to\nthese weirdos?", "This person's choices in family and friends are dodgy at best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't sound like a good combination for you. You don't need to accept who she is, you should move on and make better choices in a partner. That's the whole point of dating.", "If this is real at all and yes I am doubting it pretty hard, this person is obviously deep in to a fetish you don't seem to appreciate and that's okay! But I don't see how marrying them would work out in any capacity.\n\nNAH", "Hate to break it to you \u201cPrincess\u201d, but the two of you may just be completely sexually incompatible. \n\nSeriously, sexual compatibility is big, and your SO is clearly into kink, group sex, and her \u201cleather family\u201d.

HUGE. It's you who looks like a redflag and a trigger; not them. Do you understand?  It's ok to be apprehensive.... but years of education and tolerance are not gained quickly. And just because others enjoy or participate doesn't mean they're the redflag in this situation. \n\nYou're not wrong; just incompatible; 2 years is not enough time for this lifestyle unless you allow yourself to let go completely of your apprehensions and prior beliefs and years of taught thoughts and practices and FULLY immerse yourself... go to parties; participate in what YOU are comfortable with; watch; learn; educate; go to munches.\n\nGood luck", "That's what I mean.

Kinky people can be assholes, these people are assholes.\n\nNothing, kink included, should be your whole life. OP shouldn\u2019t have to put themself into uncomfortable situations for the sake of their girlfriends kinks.\n\nTheir behavior is COMPLETELY wrong. Why the hell would it be a red flag that OP doesn\u2019t want to be a part of graphic conversations or parties?  It\u2019s a boundary, something they should respect. \n\nThe only thing I agree with is that they seem incompatible. Because OP\u2019s girlfriend is TA for trying to force them into uncomfortable situations with no care or concern for their boundaries.", "Ima keep coming back to copy this comment every time someone disagrees with me when I say the kink community is glorified psychosis, sexual disorders, and sexual abuse, the unhinged way you talk proves my point perfectly.", "I mean the fact that you, as a member of the kink community, can't see all of the red flags here says a lot about you. The fact that they get mad at her and OP for not joining in on sex parties alone brings in some enormous red flags. They seem pretty hazy on enthusiastic consent and it's not okay.", "I\u2019m curious what aspects are non-negotiable? \n\nAlso, you say YTA and then give evidence to support the point NAH.", "You make it sound like a cult and not a life style", "Gross.", "They understand consent. They just don\u2019t like your answer. You\u2019re not joining the orgies so they\u2019re annoyed with you. \n\nThese people have issues.", "Right? They went after a girl young enough to be their kid. A vulnerable one at that", "No I regularly doubt my own reality of this me being my situation right now. You can laugh.", "I didn't say they'd be clued in; I said they should be clued in.\n\nYou're awesome for thinking this is funny, though. Awesome as a heart attack.", "Batgirl was my hero. I could be her. I knew it. Those shows showed me women could kick butt  And once I grew up more, I could be Lynda Carter/Wonder Woman. (Watch THAT one if you thought Batgirl was captivating). \n\nMatter of fact, I think I'm going to go inside and watch those again tonight. \n\n**Though while they were amazing for the TIME, our time is VERY CLEARLY DIFFERENT now. Except that women can still kick @$$ and look good doing it. \ud83d\ude01\n\nETA: You should watch them again too. Make yourself some popcorn, they're better with popcorn. \u2764\ufe0f", "Yup going with full on nope town as a nonbinary person.", "Thank you for phrasing it as \u201cbutthurt\u201d. My body is shut down because it\u2019s them that say it\u2019s me being \u201cbutthurt.\u201d I\u2019m the \u201csub/bottom\u201d in my girlfriends and I\u2019s dynamic but I would never sub for this leather family. That\u2019s where this \u201cPrincess\u201d comment comes from. She gets mad that I won\u2019t have sex with her other male partners because they would \u201creally love a boy like me.\u201d But none of them are my type. I like dating men and having s*x with people that take care of themselves, queer men that aren\u2019t ashamed of who they are. I also don\u2019t get why she hangs out with these people. She is gorgeous, successful in life, and considered someone in community. She could have anyone she wanted. The disparity in physical appearance feels off. Something tells me that\u2019s part of it for her.", "Thank you for this. I don\u2019t like saying this because no one wants to be shallow\u2014but these guys look gross. They don\u2019t have hair, they are mediocre at best, nothing careers, no hobbies, nothing interesting. They don\u2019t clean their beards? Many of them have messed up or missing teeth??When we can pick the sperm, why not pick it from something that aligns more with us? \n\nAnd it isn\u2019t helpful. It\u2019s dehumanizing.", "Fair. I get how I could\u2019ve phrased that better. But I haven\u2019t met a queer woman I\u2019ve had to explain this too. And my friends are horrified she even suggested an ex be a sperm donor. I\u2019m sure her sexuality is queer. But her politics and values, this is making me doubt that.", "He's TA because he's made his boundaries known; repeatedly yet he still stays and argues about it.... he needs to move on", "Wow... Have the day you deserve; I raise BOTH my kids in a sec positive household that's AGE APPROPRIATE... You're an AH", "Legitimate question. My understanding of kink, BDSM, fetishes is that when your fetishes become your life, that crosses the sane and healthy requirement of play? I have some weird feelings around her leather family wanting themselves to come first before her boyfriend outside of play, her family, her job, her own pregnancy process, her own friends\u2014That to me seems very unhealthy.", "The fact that they get mad is a HUGE red flag. They're pressuring you into crossing your boundaries and doing something you're not comfortable with. That's not consent even if you finally cave and participate. \n\nHonestly, doesn't sound like your partner and you may be compatible if this is the behaviour they're displaying...", "I can understand that completely. I would say that stating confidently; that's a hard limit and non-negotiable as well it's not up for discussion.... but also tell them their continued attempts to disrespect your visits is a huge redflag for you.... also sit down with GF and lay that out clearly; that she needs to hold HER family accountable when they disrespect your limits too.", "I used to think otherwise. But slowly this experience is turning out to be that. I think there are ways that the lifestyle can be quite attractive to people with personality disorders. And unfortunately, some areas hide the abuses and the abusers that happen making it even more fertile ground for people who intend harm. I\u2019ve met people who are in the community who are responsible and do not engage in harm. But I think this idea of I can like what I like without judgement is taken too far and kink can be a good mask for that. And I\u2019m weary of anyone who doesn\u2019t realistically look at that\u2014kinky or not.", "I\u2019m guessing the following: \n1. Accepting it\u2019s a large part of her life, with hook-pulls, leather workshops, BDSM conferences, panels, competitions. \n2. That once you are a part of the family you represent the family. \n3. Protocol that the leather family agrees upon. \n4. Respecting the two leaders of the group and their decisions. \n\nI fail on the last one because I don\u2019t see the hype around the two dominants at the top.", "This right here, they understand the concept but they don't respect you and are willing to violate your consent", "Thank you. That\u2019s the part that makes me feel bad. I feel as if the more I push it, she will just further go along with them but I don\u2019t like this. I have chosen family. Chosen mothers and fathers that have made sure I ate, was fed, clothed and got advice from. I spent holidays with them. Never would I ever have sex with them or let them see me have sex. I would never have scenes with them. Power play with them, etc. they don\u2019t know my kinks. And I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable letting them see me do scenes. \n\nNor would I let them pressure my partner into doing stuff they didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI worry about her often. And I don\u2019t like this. It isn\u2019t that she has these kinks or is a part of the lifestyle. Something tells me that even people in the lifestyle would be against this or at least think something is fishy. \n\nBut she thinks the world of these people.", "I can imagine.  I bet some of them are clever fuckers too and their thing is sadomasochism.  If you're not playing their game, you're likely just their play toy.  As another commenter suggested, you should just run.", "So, S03E19 Nora Clavicle and the Ladies' Crime Club [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519491/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519491/)\n\nI won't have seen this.  I'll search out a copy and hopefully watch it tonight to find out what I was missing, although with beer instead of popcorn.  Maybe I'll understand the joke too.  \n\nHas been excellent talking to you.", "Please, please think long and hard about how much you're being expected to give up for who you think she is. You seem to have her on a fairly high pedestal, but peel back how she looks, who she is in this community etc and examine how she's treating her partner. It isn't good. Her entire leather family, including herself, is predatory. This isn't how safe spaces for such things work. You sound as if you're losing yourself for her life.", "Cause she wants playthings and no Man would let her do that to them.", "I think they know they are gross, and so they do it for the shock value, and to purposely make other people feel \u201cless than\u201d. It\u2019s got to be some weird psychological thing!", "That\u2019s the thing that I don\u2019t understand. I get that some boundaries are incompatible. But if a partner voices boundaries, you can\u2019t follow them so your response is to just move on\u2014that\u2019s not actually respecting a partners boundaries. This experience has shown me some get so wrapped up in power dynamics they forget *compromise* is normal and healthy in relationships.", "What constitutes the line between believing that kink is important between VERSUS believing that kink is no longer fantasy but reality is entirely subjective and often behaviorally impossible to describe. \n\nYour partner is struggling with monetary/time commitment priorities.... Home costs versus play costs... Family time versus child care. That is what happens when people explore different priorities. \n\nAnd the two are not mutually exclusive. There are plenty of polyam, kinky parents in the world navigating those priorities.", "You seem to believe that there is a single default decision to be made once... That you and potential baby can and will always come before anyone and anything else.... Potentially you may believe that nothing required to care for your relationship or potential baby should ever be dedicated to something else. \n\nHowever, it would be thoroughly irresponsible, as a human, to have no social supports or connections and no priorities other than to raise a child. That is the way to drive humans into bad places mentally.\n\nIt's possible to do both (be kinky and be a parent). It's a balance not an all or nothing. And it sounds like you think this is an all or nothing or that you think your partner is going to abuse or neglect a potential child? \n\nAnd it sounds like you don't believe that you have the option of saying no to sex or playing with with people you don't want to have sex/ play with (that's dangerous AF). \n\nDegrading you in public for using your own sexual agency is unacceptable. \n\nExpecting that to be a dynamic that your good with even though you don't consent to is not okay. \n\nThe question of how to balance pre-parenting life with potential parenting is a pretty normal and continual set of questions parents and potential parents face.", "She has made comments that she will just replace me with submissives who are willing to do scenes with her family. She frames it as I\u2019m not a team player. It\u2019s \u201ctoo much work\u201d to do have a separate life. To her, playing with her family is non-negotiable. And they\u2019ve offered several times at this point, and I\u2019m running out of fake reasons to say no other than just no. I didn\u2019t know when I started dating her that it was date her and have sex with her leather family or leave.", "You\u2019re spot on.", "Is this a biker gang too? Damn. I'm in the kink community and nobody here lives it 24/7 with rules for others.", "Because they raised her to think that way\n\nI\u2019d leave, no need to suffer for those who won\u2019t change", "On behalf of the United States of America, I do humbly apologize for this particular incident of Americana.", "Thank you!!! Watching the Ladies crime club! \n\nMay you always have the cool side of the pillow \ud83d\ude01", "Gosh that one was terrible \ud83e\udd23 Like really awful.\n\n Women lock up all the men and take over all the jobs. Only nothing gets done because they're busy gossiping all the time. Batman gets them, though. He releases a bunch of robot mice to scare them, and the women end up releasing the men to deal with the mice \ud83d\ude02", "I didn\u2019t think of it as deliberate. I thought of it as incredibly tone deaf. But this also makes sense.", "No still means no. They should not be pressuring you for your participation. A group that will do that is not safe for you or a child.", "Thank you for this. I do believe people can be polyam and kinksters and good parents. But the priority making is not the type of values I have in parenting or relationships.", "I do not think we will come before anyone else. But she has thrown that in my face when I\u2019ve asked her to do basic things like the dishes once when she said she would. Kink dynamics aren\u2019t real life for me. And I fear they are for her. I do not consent to raising someone\u2019s child, taking care of the house, just to be told I\u2019m a good boy occasionally while she gets to spend her money, time, etc. however she wants. That isn\u2019t real intimacy. That\u2019s a dynamic, sure. But not one I consented to when I entered the relationship. And nor is it what I want the mother of my child to be like. What happens when the child is sick? Hard to tell a child that their mom can\u2019t be there because Mommy is having kink orgies. I think sometimes people get so into co-opting narratives of acceptance around kink that they think any judgement is bad. Judgment can be normal and healthy.", "IDK anything about this community but it sounds like you or your child will never be a priority so the arrangement seems unhealthy all the way round.", "Nope. Full on nope. That's dangerous. \n\nYou have to be able to say no. The fact that you don't feel you can say no without being punished, mocked, or degraded leads me to ask, quite frankly, why you want to be in a relationship where you're not allowed to say no.", "Nope. Just no. Run while you can, that's simply not okay. That's sexual harrassment.", "Why would people in a family be having sex with each other?\n\nI think the relationship may have reached its ending stages. Her 'family' wants to inseminate her with their sperm neglecting the fact that you are her partner. Maybe she can be a single parent and that family can help her raise a kid.", "NTA and it sounds like you simply need to leave. No one is respecting your boundaries, her included. Respect and consent are both major factors in the BDSM life no matter what your kinks. She's also already made the decision that if you're not playing her way, then it's not going to work. Do yourself a favor and leave. You're incompatible, kink or not.", "Then i would say NTA and to tell her YOUR Boundaries are non-negotiable; that you want to stay with her but this is a deal breaker for u", "Thank you for this. They keep normalizing it saying it\u2019s just kink but something feels off about this. They aren\u2019t a biker gang. At least that I know of.", "Indeed, she's a grown woman and you're not going to be able to separate her from the people who went after her when she was young. If she wants to leave them at some point that will be her choice, but there's no reason for you to stick around", "That's cool.  You also gave us the Six Million Dollar Man, who my hero for the longest time.  I should look those up.  I remember nothing.", "It sounds fabulous.", "Legit. It wasn't clear to me that's what you were describing and i apologize. I was clearly wrong. \n\nAs I've repeatedly stated this sounds like a dynamic that isn't healthy for you. Whether or not any potential children are involved... I'm concerned for you and your safety in the current tense. Given you are being mocked, degraded, etc for saying no to interactions you have every right to say no to)... Given that you are being told you are replaceable (ew, that's far outside the scope of your agreed upon dynamic). Given you are being told by your partner that she wants to and intends to keep doing both things... This doesn't sound healthy for you. My judgement is still and has been NTA. And i would encourage you to consider leaving this relationship as safely as you can when you can.", "Just end it bro. She's not the one for you", "Run and don\u2019t look back! This story will not have a happy ending I can assure you.", "This came up. I put a pause on baby stuff and she wasn\u2019t happy. She pouted and said \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have a baby by myself\u201d and I said \u201cyou won\u2019t be by yourself, you have your other subs and the leather family.\u201d She rolled her eyes. We didn\u2019t talk the rest of the night.", "You gave us Dr. Who. We appreciate it.", "You just need to go. This group is toxic and has poor boundary issues and a serious lack of respect. 2 years is a lot to give up on but you can't sink more time into somthing that will eventually fall apart regardless."]}
