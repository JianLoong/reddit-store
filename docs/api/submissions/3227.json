I\u2019ve met what she calls her \u201cleather family\u201d about five times now. About as frequently as I see some of my own chosen family and more frequently than I see my own family, tbh. \n\nShe tells me that they saved her from unsafe BDSM situations and accept her for who she is. So it\u2019s important I get along with them. They are like chosen family to her. I get that. But each time I hang out with them I get creepy vibes from them. Supposedly they are all queer and trans, but I feel myself explaining things about misogyny, consent, and power I shouldn\u2019t have to explain. They are also all much much older than her (we are in our 20s and they are mostly in their 50s.) They all have sex with one another at kink parties. And get mad at me (and her) for me not going to these meet ups or parties. I\u2019ve tried to politely say they aren\u2019t my type. Then my girlfriend calls me \u201cPrincess\u201d for having \u201ctoo high of standards.\u201d \n\nThey also talk too much about blood, piercings, and violence for me to withstand time around them. I wish I wasn\u2019t this sensitive. I\u2019m trying not to be. But one just kept talking about the blood/pus issues he had after top surgery at the bar. My girlfriend mentioned at one get together that we will be trying to get married and get pregnant. At this get together, people in the leather family suggested that she use her ex (who is a cis guy in the leather family) to donate sperm. When I said no, I\u2019m uncomfortable. They then offered the sperm of two other men in the leather family. I once again said I was uncomfortable. My girlfriend doesn\u2019t see the problem. She thinks they are being helpful and I don\u2019t accept her as she is. \n\nFor context, I go to my girlfriends bio family house. I plan vacations with them and I try my best to get along with them. I am friends with her friends outside of this leather family, but lately she has isolated herself from all of those people. This all escalated when this holiday season I didn\u2019t want to go to her leather families Thanksgiving. She isn\u2019t talking to me right now. I feel like a terrible boyfriend.

But looks to me like you are wasting a lot of time & effort on a basically incompatible situation. Your partner & her pals are showing you who they really are so believe them. You won't come first with your partner, you won't be helped to feel safe, and it's going to get worse not better over the years. \n\nThese unsafe folks will be physically handling your babies as they grow up, will you be okay with that? I wouldn't.", "NTA- \n\nYou're not required to like your partners friends/chosen family... In the same way that your not required to like your partners bio family or other friends... \n\nBut it's worth asking yourself if she's like really into the things they say and you're really not into it... Then are you compatible... Because not only is she on board with their comments, she endorses and defends the stuff they say around and to you. \n\nIt also sounds like your girlfriend is non monogamous but she is monogamous because she's will you? Like the play time references and group sex that you both don't attend anymore, it sounds like they are kind of like a big group unit that used to play together and now no longer do.\n\nThe fact that she degrades you on a way you aren't into (i don't know if you all are into kink) by calling you princess when she's around them is big flags. She is super into that environment. She says that she really is down with it. She's telling you that's who she is. And if you're like 'dont ever want to be around them' than i really question if you really should be around her... Because that's who she is? She's the person who makes fun of you for saying no to sex or play with people you don't want to play with or have sex with... And that's gross behavior.", "NTA it sounds like gf is being pulled back into another unhealthy group of people but she's blind to it because she sees them as her saviors.", "NTA. Run.", "Nta, you two do not seem compatible. I can tell you clearly like this woman but she is asking you to do many things you are not comfortable with. You both each deserve a partner with the same goals and wants in life.", "NTA and definitely bail now or brace for impact cause this rekationship us going to crash hard", "NTA- As hard as this is, you should break up with her. She and her friend-family shouldn't be trying to pressure you into sexual situations and their behavior has been very anti-social. That won't improve after marriage.", "NTA \n\nIt also sounds like she's taking her bad experience that this leather family helped her through or what not and is trying to recreate it with someone else just with her as the aggressor instead of the victim. \n\nShe's being transphobic by calling you princess. She's bullying you in front of these people and unless she has kink for that type of thing then that's something BOTH people consent to. \n\nIt also sounds like this leather family doesn't know what consent is just because they spend so much time together. Also like other people have said consent is a big issue in the BDSM community if you don't consent then it's a big no no to do what they haven't given you consent for. \n\nSo like I said if you didn't like this bullying she does in front of people and it's one of her kinks and she never asked for your consent then she shouldn't be in the BDSM community. Also as she is female she should understand the whole consent issue.", "You're NTA, but it does sound like you and your girlfriend aren't compatible, at least over these issues. It sounds like you've tried to accept her other family  (can't say leather family. It makes me think of leather gloves that are alive), but you've found your limits. That's okay, just as it's okay that she has hers. You both need to find a way to manage both of your viewpoints or separate, as it doesn't sound like she's willing to compromise.", "NTA.\nI won't pretend to know much about BDSM or Polygamous relationships because they don't make much sense in my mind. But I do know that they have strict rules and boundaries, and yours are being either ignored, or willfully trampled on. This isn't a relationship I'd continue to be honest, you don't feel safe, comfortable or entirely welcomed by these people and that will not change. Your GFs behaviour is concerning also.", "Dude, you\u2019re not crazy. These people are boundary stomping weirdos. They pressure you to have sex with them, nonconsensually involve you in their dynamic, get in the middle of you and your girlfriend\u2019s reproductive choices, engage in transphobic microaggressions (Princess) and mock you for having reasonable boundaries. And your girlfriend, instead of backing you up, joins them in trying to tear you down. She stops talking to you for very reasonably going \u201chey this is fucked up\u201d. \n\nI know you want something that will fix this, but I don\u2019t think it can be fixed. Your girlfriend has chosen her group of enmeshed weirdos over you. She\u2019s made it clear that the price of being a priority in her life is to make her group a priority in yours. That\u2019s a shitty fucking price. It\u2018s time to let her go. NTA.", "NTA. And this is pretty obviously a relationship that is almost certainly destined to not work out. It really does sound like you and your partner have some major incompatibility issues. You shouldn't have to keep pushing yourself to be okay with things that make you uncomfortable and your partner should validate your feelings instead of belittling you for them. Also, for the record, I think that it's pretty reasonable to find people who get angry at you and your partner for not attending their kink parties creepy - that's weird on their part.", "Run away my dear. Run away. You are so nta here, and this is very concerning :(", "NTA Not for me to say but from the description, you don't sound compatible.\n\nAs for explaining things like misogyny: rules and expectations around gender have changed drastically these past years.  While you've grown up with them, it's likely the 50-something leather family are having to work their way through modernising their viewpoints.", "NTA.  Wait.  You said you want to have children, and they offered a couple of people to get her pregnant? And you are on here wondering if you are out of line? You say that makes you uncomfortable? How about no fucking way?    Sweet summers child.  You aren\u2019t in Kansas any more.  And you seem really passive about it.  Either you are all in for this life or all out.  I don\u2019t think you can navigate a middle ground here.  That she didn\u2019t shut it down right away tells you where she is.", "NTA\n\nShe was their \u201cunicorn\u201d as it\u2019s called and they perceive you as taking her away from them, while also declining their advances. So they\u2019re doubly offended. If you were going to take their unicorn, they would have wanted you to join as a consolation prize.\n\nThe lot is weird. Your gf is weird for thinking this is okay.", "NTA I am getting strong gut sensation that you are not safe with her friends and she would go along with anything they chose to do and do nothing to protect you. If you weren't in love her, your gut would have been screaming at first meeting to get the hell out of there. Honey, your gf is not your one.", "NTA leave her and don't have kids with her, PLEASE!", "This\u2026. sounds like a cult. Like a full on cult. And you need to run and run fast.", "NTA.  You need to leave for reasons even beyond the kink stuff. Good BDSM etiquette emphasizes real consent. Additionally If she wants to spend money on leather but not on stuff for the house that's a problem", "NTA, but honestly it sounds like you need to really sit down and look at this relationship and ask if you're really compatible. It sounds like you two have incompatible life structures, as well as kinks", "NTA for so many reasons, but I have to ask (hypothetically mostly)\nWhy the hell would they think suggesting anything about anyone donating sperm was okay in that situation (or at all they don't really know you and are inconsiderate enough to not care that they make you very uncomfortable talking about the infections they got after surgeries)", "NTA. Like others have said-I think you need to accept that you and your girlfriend aren't compatible. Do you really want to deal with and compete with this \"leather family\" your entire life?", "Nta. But not taking care of yourself either. \n\nThey are trying to isolate her. This is a bunch of 50 yr old sexy friends that brought a 20 yr old into the mix. They are having fun and want to keep her. It is her kink, so she is happy for now. \n\nShe also wants a separate life it seems. She wants a home with a man and a baby, normal relations with her family. \n\nNone of that is surprising. I don't knock her for that. But she has also made it clear that she wants a man to also be a part of her leather family. You do not seem to want that for yourself at all. \n\nSo you would basically be betraying yourself and your own needs if you attempt to join the family to meet hers. She will not be happy in the relationship if you don't join the family. \n\nWhy are you considering having children with her? Because she said so? Is that a reason to bring a child into the world? Are you going to be okay with leather family helping raise your kid?\n\nThis is real. It is not all going to go away when she gets pregnant. You and she want different things in life. In bed, at least. \n\nIf you are interested and excited by her kink, and just want to go down that path slowly, maybe stay in the relationship.  If you have no interest, get out now. If you don't, you will end up with a baby that you are sharing custody with, and watching be 1/2 raised at a leather family house. \n\nEscape while you can!", "NTA. Those people are odd. Just note that these are the type of people she hangs with before planning family or wedding, could be a red flag. The sperm donor thing is pretty wtf", "Run.", "Sounds like she\u2019s not for you but nta yet to answer your question.

Why are you subjecting yourself to\nthese weirdos?", "This person's choices in family and friends are dodgy at best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't sound like a good combination for you. You don't need to accept who she is, you should move on and make better choices in a partner. That's the whole point of dating.", "If this is real at all and yes I am doubting it pretty hard, this person is obviously deep in to a fetish you don't seem to appreciate and that's okay! But I don't see how marrying them would work out in any capacity.\n\nNAH", "Hate to break it to you \u201cPrincess\u201d, but the two of you may just be completely sexually incompatible. \n\nSeriously, sexual compatibility is big, and your SO is clearly into kink, group sex, and her \u201cleather family\u201d.

I would consider members of my circle far more important then ANY \"vanilla\" family or friend that I've known my entire life. \n\nAs far as their actions at parties or conversations.... that's COMPLETELY normal for members of the community; when you consider it Abnormal or suspicious or what have you.... that's a HUGE redflag for kink members. HUGE. It's you who looks like a redflag and a trigger; not them. Do you understand?  It's ok to be apprehensive.... but years of education and tolerance are not gained quickly. And just because others enjoy or participate doesn't mean they're the redflag in this situation. \n\nYou're not wrong; just incompatible; 2 years is not enough time for this lifestyle unless you allow yourself to let go completely of your apprehensions and prior beliefs and years of taught thoughts and practices and FULLY immerse yourself... go to parties; participate in what YOU are comfortable with; watch; learn; educate; go to munches.\n\nGood luck", "That's what I mean.

Do you really want these people exercising influence on your relationship and your CHILD? Is that the life that you feel you deserve, that your child deserves?", " **NTA -** here is why. First will be overall thoughts, then my recommendation, then a breakdown of specific examples taken directly from the text of issues/non-issues I identified. It's a bit of a doozy, so strap-in lol. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Overall Thoughts**\n\nI have no issue with serious BDSM, or even the stronger stuff like sadism or hardcore degradation, ASSUMING it has the full consent of all parties *and* is practiced safely. ***People don't choose their kinks, their kinks choose them.*** You should not judge someone based on what makes them excited, you *should* judge them based on how they treat others. About the only place I am fully on board with your GF is \"accepting her for who she is,\" at least when it comes to her kink preferences. Not so much how she goes about that practicing her kink preferences though. \n\n**No kink shaming here - but part and parcel of that is NOT FORCING YOUR KINKS ON UNWILLING PARTIES.** \n\nIt seems quite clear from your post that your GF and her leather family don't seem to take no for an answer easily, and constantly trample over your very reasonable boundaries or attempt to pressure you into things you don't want. \n\n* I see serious red flags when it comes to consent\n* I see serious red flags when it comes to respecting boundaries\n* I see serious red flags when it comes to involving unwilling people in kinks\n* I see serious red flags for issues related to being in a cult-like environment\n\nYou are not the asshole AT ALL for being worried and thinking this is unhealthy. Not unhealthy because of her desire to engage in kinky BDSM stuff, but because of how she treats you. Further because of how her \"leather family\" treat you, treat your GF, and potentially even how they treat each other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Recommendations** \n\n I don't think you HAVE to necessarily end the relationship with your GF over this, but FIRST you need to sit down and have some VERY serious talks about everything I mentioned above. Start by writing a letter, explained further below. Expand upon how all this makes you feel, what worries you, how she and her actions are a part of it, how her leather family is a part of it, and while you accept her for who she is, *she also has to accept you for who you are in return*. And so do her friends.\n\nI find her self-isolating from former friends and family (who presumably aren't toxic) very worrisome, as is her refusing to talk to you over a very reasonable Thanksgiving disagreement. *This is not how healthy relationships operate*. \n\n**If a long conversation covering EVERYTHING isn't successful at making resolving these issues or at least making progress, I think this relationship might be over.** I would recommend making it clear to her she can ALWAYS reach out to you though if she finds herself in too deep, even if she pushes you away. I worry that this is headed in a cult-like direction, and she needs to know at all times she at least has a life-line to the outside world that will help her even if she was an asshole to you (assuming you are up to the task). \n\nSince you know her family, I would also consider approaching them and laying out your thoughts and fears on this issue if your talk goes south. You provided no real evidence of who they are as people, so I will leave it to you to evaluate if this is actually a good idea or not, and how to potentially go about doing it. But it is an option you should be aware of. Look for allies among her (former) friends and family, and remember that *if something can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed*, so tell them *everything* they need to know about what is going on, and see if they can reach out to her with similar messages of support in the event she goes too deep. Or just come up with a collective approach to the issue of your GF as a group. \n\n**How? This sounds like a LOT of VERY hard conversations?** \n\nSadly, if your long talk with your GF goes poorly, getting allies will involve some hard and difficult convos. Not gonna sugar coat it. BUT there is a way to make it a lot easier. \n\n***Write a letter outlining everything.*** \n\nCover all the major points, concerns, how you feel about X, etc. You can get everything down and say what you need to as perfectly as you can without worrying about messing it up in the moment. It will also help clarify your thoughts every issue, guaranteed. \n\nThen, when you need to talk to someone, hand them the letter. You can edit the baseline letter as needed for specific people if you want, adding or leaving out some info. Wait for them read it, then answer questions/have a discussion about it. Talk with them regarding what you want from them, what they can help you with, what advice of theirs you want, their thoughts on the issue, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Textual Evaluation of What Exactly is an Issue or Isn't an Issue**\n\n>They also talk too much about blood, piercings, and violence for me to withstand time around them \n\nPeople don't choose their kinks, their kinks choose them. This isn't necessarily a warning sign.   \n\n\n>I feel myself explaining things about misogyny, consent, and power I shouldn\u2019t have to explain.\n\nThis is a MASSIVE warning sign something is wrong. A serious BDSM group that doesn't know much about consent?!?! Actually insane. If YOU are having to explain basic concepts to \"kink professionals/lifestyle enthusiasts,\" something is seriously wrong with that specific group. \n\n \n\n>get mad at me (and her) for me not going to these meet ups or parties\n\nA potential waring sign, depending on what \"mad\" means. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Then my girlfriend calls me \u201cPrincess\u201d for having \u201ctoo high of standards.\u201d\n\nDefinitely a warning sign. Never lower your standards just because someone else wants you to. Never do anything you aren't comfortable with just because someone else is pressuring you, ESPECIALLY anything related to sex with a bunch of randos you don't like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>the leather family suggested that she use her ex (who is a cis guy in the leather family) to donate sperm. When I said no, I\u2019m uncomfortable. They then offered the sperm of two other men in the leather family. I once again said I was uncomfortable.\n\n**Question**: did they take \"no\" for an answer and then offer the next suggestion, or did they keep pressing over your obvious objections until it was MORE THAN CLEAR you weren't interested? This COULD be just an ask-culture guess-culture thing ([https://www.tumblr.com/tkingfisher/129997067313/ask-culture-and-guess-culture](https://www.tumblr.com/tkingfisher/129997067313/ask-culture-and-guess-culture) ), OR it could be a sign they don't respect your boundaries. Hard to say given what you have provided. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I am friends with her friends outside of this leather family, but lately she has isolated herself from all of those people.\n\nMAJOR warning sign! Every cult ever isolates people from their friends and family. Why do Mormons and other cultists have to proselytize so much? It's a win-win for the cult. Either they bring in fresh blood, OR they push away everyone who might serve as a support structure if the individual ever decides they want to get out. Now she could just be shifting her friend focus based on her new interests, things change and old friends fall by the waysides sometimes, but you used the word \"isolated\" so I assume it is more than that. Do your best to drag her back into the light of healthy friendships. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I didn\u2019t want to go to her leather families Thanksgiving. She isn\u2019t talking to me right now.\n\nAgain, it's a \"get with the program or get pushed away\" situation, which is pretty manipulative and textbook cult-like behavior. Either she gets you to go along (willingly or unwillingly), OR she pushes you away and falls further into the group, who will serve as the source of her emotional support AT THE PRICE of following and agreeing with the group and their actions.", "NTA. maybe i missed something, but why would they suggest that someone donates sperm to get her pregnant. you called yourself her boyfriend. thats why im a bit confused because i find this specific situation extremely weird and absolutely understand you dont feel comfortable.", "NTA.

You deserve someone better", "NTA\n\nYou sound like you've gone above and beyond with them.\n\n>then my girlfriend calls me \u201cPrincess\u201d for having \u201ctoo high of standards.\u201d\n\nWhy are you in a relationship where your choices are laughed at? Your boundaries are valid and to be respected.\n\nYou feel uncomfortable with them. There is no reason to ignore your gut here. \\\\you've accepted her and her family, but it seems like she has issues with you.", "NTA. You actually said it best yourself: polyamory doesn\u2019t mean lack of boundaries. You have every right to say \u201cno\u201d to what you\u2019re not comfortable with. I myself like to walk away from sex feeling like I just got into a fist fight with a bear; my boyfriend is a very gentle person that, while not opposed to ramping things up, isn\u2019t used to that type of energy. I would never, EVER shame him for that. I hate to say it, but your girlfriend sounds horrible. She is being manipulative and trying to shame and embarrass you into things you\u2019re not comfortable with. This is a serious violation of boundaries and trust. Maybe you once were compatible but it does not seem as if that is the case now.", "NTA. If your gf doesn't attend the parties either why are you the princess??  Why on earth are they suggesting donors? Are you incapable of fathering children?", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing to have a partner with a toxic family they don\u2019t want to be around and will stick up for you. But it\u2019s an entirely other thing to be required to spend time and have sex with people who denigrate you.", "INFO: if you are the boyfriend, why were they talking about sperm donors?", "NTA. Tbh, this sounds like a cult. Run away.", "NTA. Run away. It sounds like a cult and I WOULD NEVER WANT MY KID TO GROW UP WITH THESE CREEPS!", "NTA but you will be to yourself if you stay in this relationship.. the gf will NEVER put you first it will always be \"the leather family\" you wasted enough of your time.. get out now", "I'm so sorry you went through that. :/ I hope you are okay and in a better situation now", "I was told I wasn\u2019t accepting of her queerness and other people\u2019s willingness to help. She wanted a pregnancy with me, specifically. Even though she has other subs/boyfriends who can produce sperm. But she wanted me to raise the baby? So since sperm is expensive supposedly (she spends just as much on her lifestyle so I\u2019m unsure why we couldn\u2019t just pay for that part) they are supposedly helping us out. But we went through the sperm bank option. Picked out donors. I even offered to pay for it. It was dehumanizing to be told I wasn\u2019t being a team player by being upset that they all had this conversation without me. Without her even asking me if it\u2019s okay. Without any discussion of what boundaries would look like if anyone in the leather family did donate. \n\nAnd she just\u2026 defended them. Sided with them. And claims I hate people with penises now. And I find myself saying I don\u2019t. I just wanted to be consulted first.", "My first thought was that they like to tan a lot", "The first year we dated\u2014she respected my boundaries around it. I didn\u2019t have to be around them much. And I certainly wasn\u2019t asked to have sex with them. I could spend holidays with my own family and do my own thing. This happened over time. So to answer your question\u2014I didn\u2019t know it was going to be an issue. I thought I was going to be able to be kept separate.", "I\u2019m trans (assigned female at birth). I can get pregnant myself but I cannot get someone pregnant. And apparently, me being trans is something she told them. Because I wasn\u2019t sure how they knew. Since I \u201cpass\u201d.", "I\u2019m not ready to admit certain parts of this. But for the kids part\u2014as I\u2019ve stated elsewhere I paused those convos. To which she said \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have a baby by myself\u201d to which I said \u201cyou won\u2019t be by yourself, you\u2019ll have the leather family and your other boyfriends.\u201d She rolled her eyes. And one day passively aggressively packed up the nursery. \n\nI\u2019m not backing down on that. I grew up in an abusive home. One where I often had to compete with my mom\u2019s friends and randomly \u201cadopted\u201d children to get the attention I needed. I\u2019m not doing that to a child. And clearly I\u2019m not ready if I\u2019ve invited this into my life. I was very close to becoming my father.", "To clarify: I\u2019m not uncomfortable with kink. I\u2019m uncomfortable around these particular people who happen to be kinksters.", "You want to have kids with a chick that goes around fucking a gaggle of 50 year olds?  If your judgment is that bad, I think you're beyond help.", "Yeah - see: that's manipulation and gaslighting. They managed to twist this into something, that is so far away from what's actually happening. You are just communicating *your* feelings. Their queerness/you \"accepting\" it (?!) has not the slightest bit to do with that. What they are doing reminded me if DARVO (you can look it up), a manipulative tactic: distract - accuse - reverse victim and offender (I hope I got the exact words right). That is at least kind of what they are doing here. *They* are pressuring you to agree to/like an idea about how you and your gf could procreate. *you* are not doing anything that's wrong. And btw - that they are shaming you for not wanting to have sex / scenes with them (I hope I got that correctly?) borders on harassment. That is so (!) not okay. And that these people are in the BDSM community, and are still so ignorant of the concept of consent is honestly frightening (and kind of...goes against the core of what BDSM should be about). Consent that was given after pressuring/coercing the person isn't consent (regarding the things they try to pressure you into doing).\n\nI get that you are worried about your girlfriend, but I'd really say: Your first responsibility is to keep yourself safe. And that group sound really horrible and unsafe. (And maybe your girlfriend has been around their manipulation so long, that you can't really convince her they aren't safe people to be around).\nEdit: misunderstood a part of the post and corrected my comment now that I saw ny mistake", "This is all such shitty behaviour from them. You aren't an actual part of these decisions - big decisions! Raising a child is *so* so so much work. It's vital that the parents involved are having a relationship where everyone is heard and actual communication about boundaries/values etc. is possible. A healthy relationship, that is a safe for all involved. That does not seem to be the case with your gf and you. I really hope you take a step back, either completely, or at least from the bringing-a-child-into-this-world part.", "No. That\u2019s people from Florida. \ud83d\ude09", "thank you for \"unconfusing\" me and im sorry for even asking and not thinking about that myself. \n\nim sorry, that you find yourself in this situation. i dont think all this is a healthy dynamic and i believe in the long run, you would be better off without her. i know, it hurts to make decisions, but from what you wrote, she will not give her leather family up for you. you'll always come second and there is nothing worse than the feeling of being a second class person to someone you care very much about.", "This. As another fellow trans person (transmasc/nonbinary) I'd be gone the moment a partner misgenders me clearly on purpose (\"princess\" is so very gendered). And using that as an insult?! Wtf!! That's not a partner, that's some sucky/cruel human being I wouldn't want anything to do with.", "The longer I stay the more I realize no one who loves themselves would want this. That\u2019s why she hangs out with really unattractive guys who are much older. Honestly, I\u2019m starting to think that\u2019s why she dates me. And I\u2019m gonna guess she has dated other trans people who she expected to not have enough self-dignity to say this isn\u2019t okay.", "this seems more like an abusive dynamic tbh. 50 year olds trying to isolate 20 year olds? 50 year olds getting mad at someone saying no? at having boundaries? repeatedly pushing the message that if someone isn't as 'cool' as them they should be isolated out? like...thats abusive.", "Oh it gets better, she also doesn\u2019t think kids have no control and no right to privacy \n\nAgain, while having unrelated adults over to have sex with", "Omg, NTA, but this doesn\u2019t seem like a safe relationship for you. It is beyond disturbing that she\u2019s mad at you for saying no to having sex with her other partners. It doesn\u2019t matter if they would \u201creally love a boy like you\u201d if you don\u2019t want to have sex with them. They\u2019re all making it clear that they don\u2019t care about consent or boundaries. I don\u2019t usually like the jump to telling someone to end their relationship, but all of this makes me really scared for you. For polyam and bdsm to work, it has to be built on consent and mutual respect and your gf doesn\u2019t seem to have respect for you or care about your consent.", "Yeah sounds like her ideal man isn't ever gonna be in the position she wants thats why shes settling. She wants to be dominant to a CIS male and have him get fucked by her leather family but then he wouldn't be CIS anymore anyway. So as soon as she gets what she wants she loses it because its contradictory to what she wants.", "So you think it\u2019s on the victim to leave? That the predator can keep pressing, but they didn\u2019t leave, so they wanted it?", "It seems unhealthy, but you are full steam ahead on bringing children into this mess???", "You think it\u2019s on the victim to remove themselves\n\nYou said you think a leather family is **more important** than a vanilla one \n\nYou think your children have no right to a lock or door. And with the community you\u2019re in? \n\nGod help your kids", "Sounds more like a cult to me too! Honestly OP, I would leave this relationship, it doesn\u2019t sound like you would be safe or that your boundaries are being respected.", "I'm 54, in the lifestyle, and this is fishy as hell. Get out, tell your gf you are done with her leather family due to their constant limit stomping, disregard of consent, and degrading you when you don't fold and play along. She can come with you or not, but you are leaving the situation completely, even if that means leaving her. You can't save a drowning person when you're barely treading water yourself. I would bet good money that the local BDSM community considers that group to be squeaky stairs.", "Right, which is why **YOU** need to move on because this is a completely unhealthy group and she's shown that there's no way to separate her from them. She has no respect for you, internet friend. I hope you emerge from this and find a better partner.", "Then it's time to cut your losses and go OP, this is an unhealthy relationship, she's tied to them and won't leave. I understand if you care for her and want to rescue her from this dynamic, but it's just not going to happen. They've successfully programmed her. NTA but there is no win for you here.", "My dude. You are a trans guy getting misgendered by being called Princess. You are a person whose boundaries are constantly being crossed, which is a huge no-no in any sane BDSM community. You cannot get her to do chores or pay for the household. You cannot get her to place yourself first, and that you will get replaced. This is ABUSE. LEAVE. PLEASE.", "That right there is your queue to bail on the relationship, my dude. The fact is that she's willing to just replace you instead of trying to meet you halfway. \n\nThey aren't a safe group of people. They are old to be her parents. They are not respecting you when you say no and get upset when you turn them down. The fact that they've been pursuing her to push them as her first and only really family from the sounds of it makes it like they want her isolated and dependent on them. \n\nYou aren't going to win here. Cut your losses.", "For me it sounds like they are a cult", "I\u2019ve gotten mixed answers on this. They make it seem like they are beloved. They do workshops, etc. but when I talked to other kinksters, including my therapist who is both queer, polyamorous, and pro kink, she knows one of the leaders who is also a therapist in town. And has heard several things about him, the harm he causes, etc. I also do not like him. And I\u2019m expected to cause he is an elder trans guy and runs a practice that hires trans therapists to work with trans clients. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s a small town too, which doesn\u2019t help. But I\u2019m guessing based on her response\u2014there\u2019s more skeletons in that closet. And a suspicious lack on my girlfriends part to talk about previous subs and what happened to them. But every time we go to an event, other people in community love my girlfriend cause she is one of the only dominants who is young, a woman, and it helps she is stereotypically physically attractive.", "This might sound dumb. But what makes a cult\u2026 a cult? I don\u2019t think there is any belief in a higher system.", "NTA for what it's worth. \nThis whole group AND your gf sound toxic af. Wtg is that with them being angry thay you don't want to do scenes with them?\n\nHow come she didn't state that when the relationship started (as you stated you didn't know this was a thing). How can she claim it is non-negotiable and then still be with you?\nHowcome all these people are SO much older than her and you? Like what the actual hell, how are thwy so comfortable demeaning you AND pressuring you to basically fuck em? \nThat aint right. \n\nIf I was you, I'd leave to be honest.
