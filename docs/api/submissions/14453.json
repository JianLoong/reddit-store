If Jesus wiped the slate clean and gave us very few rules to live by such as \"love one another\", then nothing in Leviticus applies after Jesus's death right? Love one another. Gosh it's not that hard to do.\n\nOn the other hand if conservative Christians believe Leviticus still applies, then shouldn't they be abiding by *all the rules* and not just a small handful?
