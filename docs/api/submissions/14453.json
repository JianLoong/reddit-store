Most Christians will look at blended clothing, animal sacrifice, tearing clothes, etc. as matters of ritual or ceremony, and those are Jewish rituals, and therefore unnecessary and outdated/irrelevant.\n\nCulturally, they view not touching the carcass of small animals as \"common sense\", like not eating shellfish that has odds of poisoning you for no apparent reason. Therefore, those have nothing to do with morality or sin: they're a list of things ancient people were instructed not to do for their own physical well-being, not as a spiritual safeguard.\n\nThat's why they dismiss those things as outdated and irrelevant: they don't have moral relevance to modern Christians. \n\nAdditionally, a lot of them read the KJV bible, which calls a lot of things \"abomination\". The word \"abomination\" has a moral judgment to it, and in English, is generally used in very different contexts than what the original Hebrew word (toevah) was used for. When they see \"abomination\" applied to shellfish, they chuckle and find it quaint. But when they see the word \"abomination\" applied to homosexual relations, it rings true to what they-- culturally-- have been brought up to see as a legitimate moral question. \n\n(Sex and morality have a strange and storied relationship in Christianity, but I won't get into that today.)\n\nTo put it simply, \"toevah\" is \"prohibition\". The prohibition could be rooted in any number of reasons, and they were not all created equal.\n\nModern-day Christians, are funnily enough, continuing a very old pre-NT tradition. The Hebrew Bible has a pronounced habit of characterizing a number of sexual practices as something that \"others\" or \"outsiders\" do, and they were especially opposed to it if those practices had any spiritual or religious/ceremonial purpose to those outsiders. The Hebrew Bible characterizes these practices as deviant, and therefore, good Hebrews did not engage in these practices that were used to typify the outsider. \n\nIt's worth considering that the Hebrew Bible was not written in a vacuum. It was written by men who were surrounded by other cultures whose practices and beliefs were *very* different from the Hebrews', and the Hebrews responded by pulling away from and rejecting those other cultures. The authors of the Hebrew Bible called out these practices so explicitly for a reason, and it can be hard to detangle the moral and spiritual prohibitions from the \"we don't do that, that's what *outsiders* do\" ones. There was probably also a lot of overlap, too.\n\nAnyway, to make a long story short, it makes sense to modern Christians because like it or not, most of them are raised in a relatively puritanical society that still has an uncomfortable relationship with sex, sexuality, the human body, and gender roles. And on some level, I suspect modern-day Christians (especially conservative ones) *do* feel a strong sense of \"these practices are what *outsiders* do\", which is why they feel betrayed and like their children have been corrupted and lost to them if they turn out to be gay. \n\nIn some sense, that's consistent. Just about everything in the Old Testament that modern mainstream Christians view as a moral concern is something they (at least *nominally*, don't @ me about political hypocrisy) agree is bad: prostitution, adultery, incest, child sacrifice, robbery, murder, exploitation of the poor, usury. Prohibitions on \"deviant\" sex and sexuality are viewed as genuine moral questions rather than stuff that can be dismissed as \"ceremony\" or \"health and sanitation\".\n\n**Summary:** It makes sense if you identify which parts of Leviticus resonate with modern Christians as a legitimate moral question. Yes, it's still cherry-picking. But for real, you should've just stuck with the initial tl;dr, because humans are rarely as internally consistent as they pretend to be."]}
