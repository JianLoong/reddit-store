I was feeling kinda embarrassed, I honestly am sorta insecure about my hearing, so I didn't want to ask him to repeat himself a fourth time.

You're tryna tell me to look out for someone and you can't even tell me which guy you're warning me about?  \n\nAt that point he raised his voice at me, and yelled that it was Jesus Christ.
