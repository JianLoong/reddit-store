It shouldn't take long. We have been at MILs for 3 days now and we are all staying in her spare room. My SIL (46) also lives here permanently with her own child (13f). \n\nWell, yesterday was a rough day for me and my youngest. He has severe asthma and him and I both developed some sort of cold. We were completely down all day long and he had to use his rescue inhaler way more than usual. I also have insomnia. So on top of being sick and up with an asthmatic child, I couldn't fall asleep to save my life last night. Last I checked the clock it was 3:20ish am. \n\nMy SIL, who is fully aware of my insomnia and is also fully aware of how sick me and my kid are, decided to come and wake both me and my son up at 4am to tell me she had gotten my kids breakfast from McDonald's before she left for work. I was immediately pissed, though I just said thank you and tried my best not to show it. But at this point, my son is fully awake and due to that, so am I, after running on MAYBE an hour collectively in the past 24 hours. There was absolutely no chance of me going back to sleep (my husband had already left to go work on the house- as he's trying to get it done as soon as possible to get us out of here).\n\nWell, my husband called at 7am and asked how my morning was kicking off, cause I have to be up at 6am anyhow to get my other son off to school. I explained that his sister woke me and my youngest up at 4am to tell us she bought the kids food instead of just sending a text or leaving a note on the door and due to this I'm fucking exhausted and irritable. He completely understood and told his sister to not do that again through text. He said \"my wife and I appreciate you buying food for the kids but please refrain from waking up the kids and wife at 4am. They are sick and she has insomnia.\" SIL is pissed and saying she \"will never be nice again because it's unappreciated\".", "created_utc": 1685461293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vtopk/aita_for_causing_tension_after_being_woken_up_at/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's lucky you didn't blow up at her right then and there.", "NTA. But I would've handled it, myself.", "NTA\n\nThat sort of \"nice\" is actually thoughtless and rude. The sister needs to work on  learning real consideration for others.", "Obviously NTA, who the fuck wakes someone up at 4am to tell them they got McDonald's? Incomprehensibly rude.", "NTA it is rude to wake anyone up unless they have overslept and you have permission. It sounds like your SIL resents boundaries. She felt she did something nice so, the thanks were cancelled out by reminder of your boundaries. I hope you get back to your house soon.", "'Never wake someone up for good news'\n\nNTA.", "NTA!!\n\nFFS she can door dash breakfast but couldn't shoot you a text to let you know about breakfast? \n\nMaybe she just had a brain fart and thought with your insomnia you'd be awake anyway?

I know you say she knows you have insomnia and probably does, but she doesn't know when you went to sleep still. Did she know you went to sleep at sometime after 3:20 a.m. and did she know you were asleep at 4 a.m.? Sounds like she may have thought you were either still up or that maybe you went to sleep earlier and hadn't just went to sleep. (this kind of depends on how she woke them up. Did SIL shake OP awake or just speak into the room causing OP to awaken.)\n\nI personally assumed that even if you had insomnia you could still go back to sleep after being woken up. I didn't know that would cause you to stay awake the whole day. I assume the SIL thought the same. Instead of telling her not to wake you up like that you tell your husband on her.\n\nI get you were tired and I get that you're pregnant, but I feel as if the way you went about it all was asshole-ish. She didn't know that you'd stay up all day and just wanted to tell you she got y'all food. Not communicating with her is what made her upset.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
