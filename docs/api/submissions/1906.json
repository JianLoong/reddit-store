I work in Finance and she works in IT. The office is connected to the restaurant, so most days we go there to eat dinner. \n\nRecently, a new guy (17ishM) starting working in the restaurant. We\u2019ll call him Jon. Jon has a bit of a crush on my girlfriend. Jon impishly teases my girlfriend every time we come in to order food. His teasing, though, has a tendency to go too far. Here are a couple of things Jon does to flirt:\n- Pretends not to see or hear my girlfriend when she goes to the register \n- Refusing to take her order (i.e. she says \u201ccan I have a burger?\u201d And he says \u201cno\u201d and takes the order of the person next in line.)\n- Making her repeat her order up to 10 times\n- Purposely getting her order wrong\n- Charging her extra for things she didn\u2019t order\n- Playing keep away with straws and receipts, and if she walks away he throws it at her\n- Throwing sauce packets at her when she asks for sauce\nThere are more but these are the ones I can name off the top of my head. Keep in mind, he didn\u2019t do this to me or anyone else. \n\nMy girlfriend is very non-confrontational and shy so she usually just gives him an awkward laugh and brushes it off. At first I tried to gently tell him off, but she told me to stop and leave it be. She said he probably didn\u2019t know any better. So I did. I held my tongue as I watched my girlfriend get progressively more and more uncomfortable. So uncomfortable she started to bring snacks and skip dinner. She didn\u2019t ever want to go into the restaurant at all. \n\nOn one of the rare afternoons she wanted to eat in the restaurant, Jon was there, being insufferable, as usual. After repeating her order several time and receiving the wrong drink, my girlfriend asked for a straw. Jon continue to tease her by moving the straw around so she couldn\u2019t grab it and laughing at her. It went on for so long that the man in line behind us stepped up to tell Jon off. This is where my masculinity complex may have come in. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed that another man had to step up and take care of my girlfriend when I was standing right there. \n\nThe next day when we went to order food and Jon approached the register, I flagged down manager (who we are friends with) and asked that someone other than Jon takes our order. I explained the situation to the manager, and Jon was fired by the end of the week.\n\nMy girlfriend is furious with me. She says it was selfish of me to get someone fired because I felt emasculated by some stranger in a fast food restaurant. That I used my position of power to get a kid who didn\u2019t know any better fired. I just feel pretty guilty about the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting a man fired over my masculinity complex?", "created_utc": 1668015837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqpwsp/aita_for_getting_a_man_fired_over_my_masculinity/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jon was bullying your GF and she decided she was ok with it, for whatever reason. That was her choice. You chose to do something about it, knowing that was against your GF\u2019s wishes. The question is whether you did the right thing or not. I believe you did. How your GF feels about it it\u2019s her issue. From what you wrote it has nothing to do with \u201cmasculinity\u201d. How you react to bullies it\u2019s on the person and has nothing to do with your sex. Do you still believe you did the right thing? If yes, NTA.", "NTA, I don't think this has anything to do with a \"masculinity complex\". The kid was being a jerk, he absolutely does \"know better\", and he was doing a bad job, wasting time and annoying customers. \n\nI'm a little concerned for your GF, being so non-confrontational that she couldn't tell this guy to knock it off and wouldn't even allow you to tell this guy to knock it off. We women are used to being socialized to always be \"polite\" but she deserves better for herself.", "NTA - that wasn't a masculinity complex - your girlfriend needs to stand up for herself. He deserved to be fired. Anyone else would have complained long before it got to that point.", "NTA. He did his thing, and eventually found out. If you're a dick to your customers, customers complain. I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nIf anything, you took too long.", "NTA.  You didn't get him fired, you called attention to his behavior and his manager fired him.  His conduct was clearly offensive and in no way should your gf have put up with it.  Yes you should have said something earlier but that does not make you TA here, Jon is.", "NTA. You didn't get him fired. His own unprofessional behavior got him fired by his manager. I don't get the impression that this was a masculinity complex thing either, it just sounds like seeing somebody else step up gave you the impetus to step up as well.", "In what world is that kind of behaviour flirting??? This is more like bullying.", "NTA. Talk to your girlfriend tough. One thing is to be non confrontational, another is to take abuse from a little jerk on the daily, to the point of avoiding eating at a place she likes because said jerk would accost her. Saying this as a woman. She should be able to stand up for herself in these situations.", "NTA regardless if it was a mascilinity issue jon needed to go", "NTA \n\nI don't see how any of that is related either to a masculinity complex nor flirting \n\nIf your gf really think you acted out of jealousy, I think you should probably talk with her about the fact that, maybe watching your significant other being humiliated over and over and feeling miserable is simply something you didn't want to see anymore ? \n\nThis guy was just being an insufferable jerk to your another human being and watching this going on over and over would drive nuts pretty much anyone with any form of empathy\n\nThis was some horrendous level of unprofessionalism, had anyone do that to me ONCE in a restaurant I'd not let things go so easily", "NTA. Jon got himself fired for being an AH and unprofessional.", "There's a couple of things going on here:\n\n* Jon was behaving inappropriately and doing his job poorly    \n* His behavior was upsetting your GF, but she refused to say anything herself and also didn't want you saying anything.     \n* Someone else felt obligated to call out Jon's behavior and you felt emasculated because that should have been your role as the boyfriend.  \n* Jon was fired\n\nfirst off, Jon was fired for his workplace behavior.  You have no idea if your GF was the only person he acted that way towards, and it's unlikely to be so.  The 20 year old \"corporate finance\" guy isn't exactly slinging around a massive amount of corporate clout that's intimidating the store manager into firing people.  \n\nWhy did your GF dislike the behavior, but refuse to do or allow anyone to do anything about it?  that's something only she can explain, I got no help for you there.    \n\nthe emasculating part is all in your head.  You were respecting her wishes to not get into the mix, and a random stranger who was not obligated to stay out of it stepped in.  Nobody was wrong here (except Jon).\n\nit's a tough call....you're kind of in the wrong because you stepped in when your GF asked you not to, but at the same time she doesnt get to forbid you to ignore something that was absolutely negatively impacting your own life, and nothing said or done was untrue.\n\nSo I'm going with overall NTA, but I'm a bit amused at \"used my position of power\" which is honestly an amusing mental image.", "NTA the only thing you did wrong was not doing it sooner. Your GF is wrong to be mad at you, the asshole deserved to be fired.", "Nta, you didn't get him fired, his actions got him fired! And for her to say he probably didn't know better is just BS he's what 17? He knows right from wrong. Your gf is an AH to herself for allowing that behavior to continue. I guess you should've anonymously reported him. or pulled the manager aside and told them to sit back in the curtains to see this behavior himself instead of telling him what's going on yourself.", "NTA\n\nThe only way you\u2019re an AH here, is for waiting as long as you did. It is embarrassing that someone else had to stand up for someone you\u2019re with.\n\nHe got himself fired. Nothing to do with flirting/harassment/masculinity, he was a horrible cashier. He literally wasn\u2019t doing his job.", "NTA\n\nHe wasn't flirting with your girlfriend, he was harassing her. You did the right thing by reporting him.", "NTA it's not at all a \"masculinity complex\" to be offended by seeing a man harassing a woman to distraction. It's not a man thing or a woman thing, it's a human thing.", "NTA. He should have been fired long before. That is unprofessional behavior by any stretch.\n\nHe KNEW better and CHOSE to do it. You weren't being emasculated, your girlfriend was being treated unprofessionally as a CUSTOMER of the establishment. The fact you work there is irrelevant.", "NTA. I\u2019m non confrontational, I hate telling people to stop when they play those games with me because it feels uncomfortable. That being said, I\u2019m confused why your girlfriend would be so uncomfortable but want him to keep his job there. If he\u2019s 17, he SHOULD know better than to waste the restaurants money on purposeful mistakes and tease customers.", "NTA for getting him fired, he deserved it\nbut yta for not saying something sooner.", "NTA for getting him fired since he's only 17 but YTA for not doing something the first time. What he was doing wasn't flirting but bordering harassing your girlfriend who was just trying to order food.", "NTA. His behavior was wildly inappropriate. May this be a lesson to him. Actions have consequences.", "NTA. What took you so long? You can only put up with childish stuff like this for so long. It has nothing to do with masculinity, and everything to do with standing up for your GF. Your GF must have enjoyed it though if that was her teaction.", "NTA and honestly I\u2019m going to say your gf is a pushover, that doesn\u2019t spell good things for her, you should talk about it. I get non confrontational, I\u2019m this way, but come on, show some backbone! And she shouldn\u2019t be mad at you because you stand up for her, that\u2019s just misplaced repressed anger.", "YTA for not doing something sooner. Who taught this man being openly disrespectful is how you flirt? I'd see tossing her extra cookies not messing up her order or not taking it properly on purpose. Also, his behavior is ridiculous and inappropriate. Someone should be fired for behaving like that. As a female bartender if I that aggressively flirted with or disrespected a guest I'd be canned immediately. The only thing wrong here is that this was allowed to go on so long. It only reinforces to men making women uncomfortable is no big deal.", "Nta. Should have spoken with the manager in the beginning. This is this kids own fault for his rude behavior and bad customer service. If the manager fired him this quickly then there must have been more issue other then this one.", "NTA. It was sexual harrassment. It doesn't' matter if it was directed to you or not. You felt uncomfortable and you should have reported it to HR immediately. As for the GF, she has clearly been taught to go along with the patriarchy and not rock the boat.", "NTA. Where the fuck did he learn to flirt, first grade?", "NTA.  Jon got Jon fired.  Dollars to donuts there have been many other complaints about Jon from other diners.  The manager knows you and believes you and your complaint might have been just one too many for the manager.\n\nNTA.  I would have been embarrassed also if the guy behind me stepped up when I had not.", "Overall, I\u2019d say NTA, but you get about 1 out of 5 As because you really should have reported his harassment sooner.", "NTA for getting him fired, but you could have also, I don\u2019t know, tried harder? You gently told him off once and it didn\u2019t change. Maybe try again but not so gently? Or just order your food together? That way you\u2019re not just sending your gf in to do battle alone.", "I think this is a net NTA.  Your motivations seemed to be more about competing with Jon (you call him a kid but you are all within a few years of each others' ages) and feeling emasculated by the other guy sticking up for your girlfriend. In addition, your GF--the victim here--asked you not to do anything. \n\nUltimately, though, you did right by Jon.  He needs to learn this is not appropriate workplace behavior or a means of interacting with customers.  You tried to gently tell him off, and he didn't listen--so he had to learn the hard way by losing his job.", "It should also be noted that my girlfriend thought that Jon likely had some sort of mental handicap, and that was part of the reason she was so insistent I don\u2019t interfere. I do see now though that this was really no excuse and I should\u2019ve been more harsh despite her requests.", "ESH\n\nThe behavior you describe is not Jon \"flirting\" - it's grossly inappropriate behavior towards  a fellow employee. Jon is sexually harassing your gf. That deserves being fired. It would have been better if management could have addressed this earlier - most of Jon's issues seem to be associated with being an immature teenager who hasn't been taught how to behave, and a sharp correction early might have modified his behavior.\n\nYou are, however, an AH for your ridiculous feelings of emasculation.", "Esh yu only said something bc of someone came to her rescue instead of yu", "YTA for only defending your gf when someone else steps up to do it. You could have told the guy to knock it off without being a dick at anytime or asked for another person to take y\u2019all\u2019s order previously to this. The fact that you only did it because you were emasculated and then you went slightly nuclear makes you TAH.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA for getting him fired but YTA towards lack of help with your girlfriend. \n\nWhy couldn\u2019t you just had asked for the straw / sauce/ ordered her food whatever. Why did you leave her to and even worse watch her have to interact with him all the time. She was obviously so uncomfortable she didn\u2019t want to return.

He was targeting her and behaving most unprofessionally for only reasons he can explain.  He might have been jealous or had feelings of his own insecurities, but none of that matters.  \n\nShould this ever happen again, ask to speak to a manager, immediately.  His behavior was everything a fast food clerk should NOT be displaying.  He was rude and inappropriate to customers, period.  \n\nNo need to feel guilty....either one of you.

I can see how Jon would get the idea that you were being overprotective if your gf acted fije with the interactions & never said or did anything overtly to tell him she was unhappy with his behaviour. She should have wanted to tell the manager to stop the innapropriate behaviour, why didn't she?", "NTA\n\nThe kid got himself fired for bullying a customer.
