I work in Finance and she works in IT. The office is connected to the restaurant, so most days we go there to eat dinner. \n\nRecently, a new guy (17ishM) starting working in the restaurant. We\u2019ll call him Jon. Jon has a bit of a crush on my girlfriend. Jon impishly teases my girlfriend every time we come in to order food. His teasing, though, has a tendency to go too far. Here are a couple of things Jon does to flirt:\n- Pretends not to see or hear my girlfriend when she goes to the register \n- Refusing to take her order (i.e. she says \u201ccan I have a burger?\u201d And he says \u201cno\u201d and takes the order of the person next in line.)\n- Making her repeat her order up to 10 times\n- Purposely getting her order wrong\n- Charging her extra for things she didn\u2019t order\n- Playing keep away with straws and receipts, and if she walks away he throws it at her\n- Throwing sauce packets at her when she asks for sauce\nThere are more but these are the ones I can name off the top of my head. Keep in mind, he didn\u2019t do this to me or anyone else. \n\nMy girlfriend is very non-confrontational and shy so she usually just gives him an awkward laugh and brushes it off. At first I tried to gently tell him off, but she told me to stop and leave it be. She said he probably didn\u2019t know any better. So I did. I held my tongue as I watched my girlfriend get progressively more and more uncomfortable. So uncomfortable she started to bring snacks and skip dinner. She didn\u2019t ever want to go into the restaurant at all. \n\nOn one of the rare afternoons she wanted to eat in the restaurant, Jon was there, being insufferable, as usual. After repeating her order several time and receiving the wrong drink, my girlfriend asked for a straw. Jon continue to tease her by moving the straw around so she couldn\u2019t grab it and laughing at her. It went on for so long that the man in line behind us stepped up to tell Jon off. This is where my masculinity complex may have come in. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed that another man had to step up and take care of my girlfriend when I was standing right there. \n\nThe next day when we went to order food and Jon approached the register, I flagged down manager (who we are friends with) and asked that someone other than Jon takes our order. I explained the situation to the manager, and Jon was fired by the end of the week.\n\nMy girlfriend is furious with me. She says it was selfish of me to get someone fired because I felt emasculated by some stranger in a fast food restaurant. That I used my position of power to get a kid who didn\u2019t know any better fired. I just feel pretty guilty about the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting a man fired over my masculinity complex?\n\nEdit: I should note that I\u2019m inclined to believe that Jon genuinely thought what he was doing was funny. He was never out right harsh with my girlfriend, he thought it was joke. He usually followed it with something like \u201cyou gotta have fun where you can\u201d", "created_utc": 1668015837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqpwsp/aita_for_getting_a_man_fired_over_my_masculinity/", "score": 1055, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jon was bullying your GF and she decided she was ok with it, for whatever reason. That was her choice. You chose to do something about it, knowing that was against your GF\u2019s wishes. The question is whether you did the right thing or not. I believe you did. How your GF feels about it it\u2019s her issue. From what you wrote it has nothing to do with \u201cmasculinity\u201d. How you react to bullies it\u2019s on the person and has nothing to do with your sex. Do you still believe you did the right thing? If yes, NTA.", "NTA, I don't think this has anything to do with a \"masculinity complex\". The kid was being a jerk, he absolutely does \"know better\", and he was doing a bad job, wasting time and annoying customers. \n\nI'm a little concerned for your GF, being so non-confrontational that she couldn't tell this guy to knock it off and wouldn't even allow you to tell this guy to knock it off. We women are used to being socialized to always be \"polite\" but she deserves better for herself.", "NTA - that wasn't a masculinity complex - your girlfriend needs to stand up for herself. He deserved to be fired. Anyone else would have complained long before it got to that point.", "NTA. He did his thing, and eventually found out. If you're a dick to your customers, customers complain. I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nIf anything, you took too long.", "NTA.  You didn't get him fired, you called attention to his behavior and his manager fired him.  His conduct was clearly offensive and in no way should your gf have put up with it.  Yes you should have said something earlier but that does not make you TA here, Jon is.", "NTA. You didn't get him fired. His own unprofessional behavior got him fired by his manager. I don't get the impression that this was a masculinity complex thing either, it just sounds like seeing somebody else step up gave you the impetus to step up as well.", "In what world is that kind of behaviour flirting??? This is more like bullying.", "NTA. Talk to your girlfriend tough. One thing is to be non confrontational, another is to take abuse from a little jerk on the daily, to the point of avoiding eating at a place she likes because said jerk would accost her. Saying this as a woman. She should be able to stand up for herself in these situations.\nETA: the only way I could understand her resistance to confrontation is if she thought the guy was neurodivergent. But I don\u2019t want to be one those people who diagnose others so I\u2019ll leave it here as a thought.", "NTA regardless if it was a mascilinity issue jon needed to go", "NTA \n\nI don't see how any of that is related either to a masculinity complex nor flirting \n\nIf your gf really think you acted out of jealousy, I think you should probably talk with her about the fact that, maybe watching your significant other being humiliated over and over and feeling miserable is simply something you didn't want to see anymore ? \n\nThis guy was just being an insufferable jerk to your another human being and watching this going on over and over would drive nuts pretty much anyone with any form of empathy\n\nThis was some horrendous level of unprofessionalism, had anyone do that to me ONCE in a restaurant I'd not let things go so easily", "NTA. Jon got himself fired for being an AH and unprofessional.", "There's a couple of things going on here:\n\n* Jon was behaving inappropriately and doing his job poorly    \n* His behavior was upsetting your GF, but she refused to say anything herself and also didn't want you saying anything.     \n* Someone else felt obligated to call out Jon's behavior and you felt emasculated because that should have been your role as the boyfriend.  \n* Jon was fired\n\nfirst off, Jon was fired for his workplace behavior.  You have no idea if your GF was the only person he acted that way towards, and it's unlikely to be so.  The 20 year old \"corporate finance\" guy isn't exactly slinging around a massive amount of corporate clout that's intimidating the store manager into firing people.  \n\nWhy did your GF dislike the behavior, but refuse to do or allow anyone to do anything about it?  that's something only she can explain, I got no help for you there.    \n\nthe emasculating part is all in your head.  You were respecting her wishes to not get into the mix, and a random stranger who was not obligated to stay out of it stepped in.  Nobody was wrong here (except Jon).\n\nit's a tough call....you're kind of in the wrong because you stepped in when your GF asked you not to, but at the same time she doesnt get to forbid you to ignore something that was absolutely negatively impacting your own life, and nothing said or done was untrue.\n\nSo I'm going with overall NTA, but I'm a bit amused at \"used my position of power\" which is honestly an amusing mental image.", "NTA the only thing you did wrong was not doing it sooner. Your GF is wrong to be mad at you, the asshole deserved to be fired.", "Nta, you didn't get him fired, his actions got him fired! And for her to say he probably didn't know better is just BS he's what 17? He knows right from wrong. Your gf is an AH to herself for allowing that behavior to continue. I guess you should've anonymously reported him. or pulled the manager aside and told them to sit back in the curtains to see this behavior himself instead of telling him what's going on yourself.", "NTA\n\nThe only way you\u2019re an AH here, is for waiting as long as you did. It is embarrassing that someone else had to stand up for someone you\u2019re with.\n\nHe got himself fired. Nothing to do with flirting/harassment/masculinity, he was a horrible cashier. He literally wasn\u2019t doing his job.", "NTA\n\nHe wasn't flirting with your girlfriend, he was harassing her. You did the right thing by reporting him.", "NTA it's not at all a \"masculinity complex\" to be offended by seeing a man harassing a woman to distraction. It's not a man thing or a woman thing, it's a human thing.", "NTA. He should have been fired long before. That is unprofessional behavior by any stretch.\n\nHe KNEW better and CHOSE to do it. You weren't being emasculated, your girlfriend was being treated unprofessionally as a CUSTOMER of the establishment. The fact you work there is irrelevant.", "NTA. I\u2019m non confrontational, I hate telling people to stop when they play those games with me because it feels uncomfortable. That being said, I\u2019m confused why your girlfriend would be so uncomfortable but want him to keep his job there. If he\u2019s 17, he SHOULD know better than to waste the restaurants money on purposeful mistakes and tease customers.", "NTA for getting him fired, he deserved it\nbut yta for not saying something sooner.", "NTA for getting him fired since he's only 17 but YTA for not doing something the first time. What he was doing wasn't flirting but bordering harassing your girlfriend who was just trying to order food.", "NTA. His behavior was wildly inappropriate. May this be a lesson to him. Actions have consequences.", "NTA. What took you so long? You can only put up with childish stuff like this for so long. It has nothing to do with masculinity, and everything to do with standing up for your GF. Your GF must have enjoyed it though if that was her teaction.", "NTA and honestly I\u2019m going to say your gf is a pushover, that doesn\u2019t spell good things for her, you should talk about it. I get non confrontational, I\u2019m this way, but come on, show some backbone! And she shouldn\u2019t be mad at you because you stand up for her, that\u2019s just misplaced repressed anger.", "YTA for not doing something sooner. Who taught this man being openly disrespectful is how you flirt? I'd see tossing her extra cookies not messing up her order or not taking it properly on purpose. Also, his behavior is ridiculous and inappropriate. Someone should be fired for behaving like that. As a female bartender if I that aggressively flirted with or disrespected a guest I'd be canned immediately. The only thing wrong here is that this was allowed to go on so long. It only reinforces to men making women uncomfortable is no big deal.", "Nta. Should have spoken with the manager in the beginning. This is this kids own fault for his rude behavior and bad customer service. If the manager fired him this quickly then there must have been more issue other then this one.", "NTA. It was sexual harrassment. It doesn't' matter if it was directed to you or not. You felt uncomfortable and you should have reported it to HR immediately. As for the GF, she has clearly been taught to go along with the patriarchy and not rock the boat.", "NTA. Where the fuck did he learn to flirt, first grade?", "NTA.  Jon got Jon fired.  Dollars to donuts there have been many other complaints about Jon from other diners.  The manager knows you and believes you and your complaint might have been just one too many for the manager.\n\nNTA.  I would have been embarrassed also if the guy behind me stepped up when I had not.", "Overall, I\u2019d say NTA, but you get about 1 out of 5 As because you really should have reported his harassment sooner.", "NTA for getting him fired, but you could have also, I don\u2019t know, tried harder? You gently told him off once and it didn\u2019t change. Maybe try again but not so gently? Or just order your food together? That way you\u2019re not just sending your gf in to do battle alone.", "I think this is a net NTA.  Your motivations seemed to be more about competing with Jon (you call him a kid but you are all within a few years of each others' ages) and feeling emasculated by the other guy sticking up for your girlfriend. In addition, your GF--the victim here--asked you not to do anything. \n\nUltimately, though, you did right by Jon.  He needs to learn this is not appropriate workplace behavior or a means of interacting with customers.  You tried to gently tell him off, and he didn't listen--so he had to learn the hard way by losing his job.", "It should also be noted that my girlfriend thought that Jon likely had some sort of mental handicap, and that was part of the reason she was so insistent I don\u2019t interfere. I do see now though that this was really no excuse and I should\u2019ve been more harsh despite her requests.", "ESH\n\nThe behavior you describe is not Jon \"flirting\" - it's grossly inappropriate behavior towards  a fellow employee. Jon is sexually harassing your gf. That deserves being fired. It would have been better if management could have addressed this earlier - most of Jon's issues seem to be associated with being an immature teenager who hasn't been taught how to behave, and a sharp correction early might have modified his behavior.\n\nYou are, however, an AH for your ridiculous feelings of emasculation.", "Esh yu only said something bc of someone came to her rescue instead of yu", "YTA for only defending your gf when someone else steps up to do it. You could have told the guy to knock it off without being a dick at anytime or asked for another person to take y\u2019all\u2019s order previously to this. The fact that you only did it because you were emasculated and then you went slightly nuclear makes you TAH.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA for getting him fired but YTA towards lack of help with your girlfriend. \n\nWhy couldn\u2019t you just had asked for the straw / sauce/ ordered her food whatever. Why did you leave her to and even worse watch her have to interact with him all the time. She was obviously so uncomfortable she didn\u2019t want to return.

He might have been jealous or had feelings of his own insecurities, but none of that matters.  \n\nShould this ever happen again, ask to speak to a manager, immediately.  His behavior was everything a fast food clerk should NOT be displaying.  He was rude and inappropriate to customers, period.  \n\nNo need to feel guilty....either one of you.

Every person who walked in that restaurant was being impacted by the atmosphere being created in the place and the attitudes that were being allowed to fester. If I witnessed that behavior, I wouldn't want to go in there either and would feel uneasy about patronizing a place where it was clearly allowed. Can you think of yourself as also standing up for the people-women and men or whomever-who were being directly addressed by Jon or uneasy (if not directly targeted) but for whatever reason didn't feel safe confronting it or reporting it?

The GF doesn't get to determine the whole course of action for others who were being impacted by Jon, nor does she get to determine what OP does in response to that kind of behavior in general.

Abusers keep pushing the envelope to see what they can get away with and will escalate if they are not called out and held to consequences.

Even if they don't target the more extreme behaviors at women in a more privileged position (white, middle class or above, or with potential connections/influence) they might aim them at more vulnerable women who would be less likely to reach out for help or to be believed if they do. I've been in the GF's place-reluctant to confront someone or potentially destroy their lives by getting them fired \"simply\" because I was being harassed or threatened in some way (I didn't think I was \"worth\" any concern).

In general, I don't believe that mental illness/disability should be a free pass to threaten people or treat them badly and I try to operate on that, rather than my personal discomfort about destroying a vulnerable person's livelihood. It's a difficult thing to do, as it involves unlearning decades of social conditioning not to make a fuss, years of lessons that any harassment is somehow my fault or that I \"asked for it\" in some way, plus any kinds of personal traumas that can compound it all.

I assumed it was just the boyfriend who was being called an AH based on the comment I was replying to, but it sounds like you're saying that everyone who didn't speak up actually shares equal responsibility for them all collectively being an AH.\n\nI guess I just don't see how calling people assholes is going to make the world a better place or make people want to call out bigotry.

It\u2019s pretty shitty of her to tolerate being bullied by some kid but having no problem being mad at you for standing up for her, especially when she\u2019s trying to spin what you did (which anyone with a shred of decency would do) as toxic masculinity.", "NTA:  Also, tell your girlfreind that when a customer had to step in and get angry with Jon it was no longer just between you, your girlfriend, and Jon; it was starting to negatively inpact customers and business.", "NTA. Jon\u2019s behavior was not funny and was not him trying to flirt. I get that a lot of people believe that males who are mean to females they like is cute but it really isn\u2019t. Jon is young and maybe didn\u2019t understand his behavior was unacceptable. It could have been a teachable moment for him but you are not required to do that teaching. Your girlfriend was. While she isn\u2019t comfortable or even required to get into a confrontation with Jon, the situation would have ended much earlier. If you were friends with the manager, you could have said something discreetly without risking his job but that still wasn\u2019t your responsibility to do. I\u2019m willing to bet your gf isn\u2019t the only customer he does this to and the man that stepped in wasn\u2019t the first to take note of it/be annoyed by it. Jon learned a valuable lesson regardless of how it came about. Hopefully he understands the lesson and acts accordingly moving forward.", "So none of you said anything to Jon and ask him to stop doing dumb shit before flagging down the manager? A kid got fired because none of you know how to give proper feedback and state your boundaries? Goddamn.", "NTA. This wasn't about a masculinity complex, this was about someone in the service industry acting inappropriately and finally being caught. Like others have said, it wasn't the first time he did it and most likely not the only person he did it to. \n\nHe was harassing a customer, delaying service to other people while doing it, and performing his job so poorly it set off another customer. You might have done him a favor by calling the manager's attention to this earlier when it would have been a write up rather than a firing.", "NTA. It's not like you told your manager friend to fire him outright, you simply told him why you were annoyed and the manager made his own decision. Besides, it's not like he fired him on the spot, he was fired by the end of the week.", "It\u2019s a good thing your girlfriend is non confrontational otherwise she should dump your pathetic a___.  I would have dealt with him the first time he pulled that crap.", "NTA\n\nIf he did this to your girlfriend, what is to stop him doing it to other female customers? Would she would be fine with him treating others the same way?\n\nHis manager should know about his behavior. And, ideally, have talked to him about fixing it - the fact he got fired a few days later makes it likely this wasn't his only strike, or that he didn't show any signs of planning to correct how he was acting.", "NTA, I understand your frustration about not reacting to this guy bothering your gf and another guy stepping up. However, you were doing what you gf told you. Just let it be. Once a therapist told me that when we have the choice of doing something \"right\" or doing what our friend tells us to do (as long as it doesn't put them in danger), we should choose our friend. In this case, you were being supportive of her choice of letting this guy be. You acted right. \n\nI do worry about your gf not being able to stop abusive behaviour like this one. I try to imagine all the actions you describe as flirting and I cannot see it that way, this is rude and abusive, you cannot throw stuff at customers or make fun of them. She deserves respect from everyone regardless of their feelings for her. Nothing excuses this behaviour.\n\nLastly, this guy deserved to be fired. Your gf is only looking at this from the \"guy who likes me\" POV, BUT before that, this guy is an employee at customer service position. He must be respectful to the customers. In this situation your gf is not the girl to be pursued,  is a customer that must be treated just as any customer, I'm sure there's rules about how to interact with customers and I'm sure this guy broke all of them. \n\nI understand (although I'm not sure if I agree) your gf saying this guy probably doesn't know any better, but he needs to. He is about to be an adult and about to enter the workforce, he needs to start acting as such.", "NTA \n\nLet\u2019s be clear you DID NOT get Jon fired. Jon got Jon fired. If Jon wasn\u2019t acting like an ass there would\u2019ve been nothing to report to his manager. The masculinity complex is all in your head. You handled the situation as best you could by respecting your girlfriend\u2019s request to not make a big deal about it. She on the other hand needs to be more assertive I get that we as women have watch what we say to some dudes because there are psychos who will try to harm us but this kid shouldn\u2019t have been able to carry on as long as he did.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m just like, why the fuck didn\u2019t someone say something sooner? Good for the random stranger who told this kid to knock it off.\n\nWhat Jon was doing was sexual harrassment. THAT is why he was fired - that has nothing to do with your masculinity. Frankly he needs to learn this lesson now, not people avoid confrontation because he\u2019s young.", "NTA he did know better or he does now he never would if he didn\u2019t get in trouble for his bad behavior.", "NTA. Jon brought this on himself.", "ESH\n\nyour gf needs to speak up. Guy probably didn't know he was being annoying and weird. No-one told him. You didn't stand up for her really, you acted to save face after someone else spoke up.", "You were honoring what she had explicitly asked you to do by not saying anything. But at the same time, she has some issues that make it difficult or impossible for her to realize when she is being treated abusively. (No shaming here, way too many of us are socialized the same way.)\nBut I think maybe seeing a stranger\u2019s reaction might have jolted you into the awareness that this dude isn\u2019t flirting. He is treating your gf in an egregiously humiliating fashion. He is getting off on the fact that he can get away with treating someone \u201cfrom corporate\u201d like this. \nI sincerely hope your gf can get in to see a counselor to build up her sense of worth and ability to recognize abuse for what it is. \nYou\u2019re NTA, btw.", "NTA.\n\nDude was harassing your gf. Period. Shit isn't cute or funny. Thisnis the result of telling little boys and girls that the mean boys that picks on you just likes you. \n\nIt's unprofessional. And he upset another customer with his behavior.\n\nPlay stupid games.\n\nI hope you deal with your emasculation issue, though. Your pride getting hurt being your priority and not \"my gf is being targeted and needs to be defended\" is a litttttle bit of an issue, but I'm sure you know that. I honestly dont think you were emasculated, i think you were just annoyed on her behalf, but ypure the only one who knows how you really.feel. ill leave that to you. I can understand why she's annoyed, but at the same time, it kind of seems like she needs to grow a bit of a backbone too.", "Nope.  All that 'joking' is a form of bullying.  He should have been disciplined way earlier.  Like the first time it happened.  If that were me Id be up the fucking managers ass so hard,  At 17 everyone knows its not ok to 'tease' people like this.  Hes a straight up jerk and you both were wrong to let it go as long as it did.  You're not TA but you both should have spoken up way sooner and maybe he wouldnt have been fired.  Ugh.", "NTA - Even if I was just a co-worker or even a stranger, I would have ripped him a new one if I saw that kind of behavior.  \n\nYour gf has a pathological aversion to confrontation to her own detriment.  She needs to work on if she is so timid that she'll let someone treat her that way for a prolonged period, so much so that she started skipping meals.\n\nIs she on the spectrum by any chance?", "I cannot believe your GF is mad at you over this. \n\nNTA\n\nThat guy was far far out of line. I know these are all kids, but if the manager was there, WHY was he letting this happen, especially when there was a line of customers???\n\nIf his behavior was so over the line that a complete stranger, a customer, felt it was appropriate to tell him off, that was the issue. YOU didn't get him fired. There are a lot of fast food outlets around, usually. If I were a customer and this kid was always pulling this stuff while I was waiting in line, I would just go to a different business down the block, so really he wasn't representing the company well at all.", "NTA. He wouldn\u2019t have been fired for just that anyway- there\u2019s usually some sort of strike system, and I\u2019m sure someone else has complained about him if it got that extreme.", "Okay so I work in a restaurant and this kinda \u201cflirty\u201d behaviour is pretty common for my specific chain. Yeah, teen boys (and older male staff) will  often be over friendly or flirty with the female staff. Are you an asshole for getting the guy fired? Idk, it\u2019s the managers decision to let them go. However if you were honest about their behaviour then, Nta but if you had over exaggerated the situation which led to them being fired then yea, yta.", "NTA. Jon and your GF are though. She should have dealt with this much sooner and in allowing it to continue, caused his firing to happen.", "NTA and I would find a GF with self respect and can stand up for herself. If she wants to be a pushover and to complain when you help she is doomed to a terrible life.", "NTA except for assuming the reason someone is harassing your girlfriend is because he has a crush. He did it because he could get away with it and has severe issues. He might be young but he should know that throwing things at people, ignoring them, insulting them etc is not a joke or \"fun\" unless that person is bully. He did this to a customer, God knows what he is doing to his coworkers and the impact it has on other people who had to watch this BS play out. \n\nYour girlfriend should know that the standard she accepts is the standard she encourages, by accepting this behaviour when she had the power to intervene without fear of repercussions she decided that his behaviour towards women was appropriate.

At first I tried to gently tell him off, but she told me to stop and leave it be. She said he probably didn\u2019t know any better. So I did. I held my tongue as I watched my girlfriend get progressively more and more uncomfortable. So uncomfortable she started to bring snacks and skip dinner.

But is it her place to have objects thrown at her, to be charged for incorrect orders, to be 'forced' to repeat orders again and again and to be ignored when placing an order?

Most of what I do is to make people feel more comfortable around me not less (it actually makes my job easier if people like me). The only people I like to make feel uncomfortable is the people that creep on the staff (I work with probably 80% women) and the people that are generally assholes, not gonna lie it's fun sometimes because I spend so much time trying not to be intimidating as I'm a big guy ( I used to be a football lineman in highschool, and I worked out with the powerlifting team).", "Is it bad all that I could think of while reading this is \"Security, complicated order\"", "Plus I doubt OPs comments were the sole reason for termination.  They probably went back and reviewed security footage and saw what happened and maybe went back further and decided that was enough but more likely they found that his massive immaturity had other negative behaviors that impacted others that aren\u2019t even readily apparent to OP or the GF.  I agree though, she needs to learn how to be more assertive, is she going to let everyone walk over her for her whole life because that is a massive problem", "This.
