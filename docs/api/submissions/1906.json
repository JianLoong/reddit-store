I work in Finance and she works in IT. The office is connected to the restaurant, so most days we go there to eat dinner. \n\nRecently, a new guy (17ishM) starting working in the restaurant. We\u2019ll call him Jon. Jon has a bit of a crush on my girlfriend. Jon impishly teases my girlfriend every time we come in to order food. His teasing, though, has a tendency to go too far. Here are a couple of things Jon does to flirt:\n- Pretends not to see or hear my girlfriend when she goes to the register \n- Refusing to take her order (i.e. she says \u201ccan I have a burger?\u201d And he says \u201cno\u201d and takes the order of the person next in line.)\n- Making her repeat her order up to 10 times\n- Purposely getting her order wrong\n- Charging her extra for things she didn\u2019t order\n- Playing keep away with straws and receipts, and if she walks away he throws it at her\n- Throwing sauce packets at her when she asks for sauce\nThere are more but these are the ones I can name off the top of my head. Keep in mind, he didn\u2019t do this to me or anyone else. \n\nMy girlfriend is very non-confrontational and shy so she usually just gives him an awkward laugh and brushes it off. At first I tried to gently tell him off, but she told me to stop and leave it be. She said he probably didn\u2019t know any better. So I did. I held my tongue as I watched my girlfriend get progressively more and more uncomfortable. So uncomfortable she started to bring snacks and skip dinner. She didn\u2019t ever want to go into the restaurant at all. \n\nOn one of the rare afternoons she wanted to eat in the restaurant, Jon was there, being insufferable, as usual. After repeating her order several time and receiving the wrong drink, my girlfriend asked for a straw. Jon continue to tease her by moving the straw around so she couldn\u2019t grab it and laughing at her. It went on for so long that the man in line behind us stepped up to tell Jon off. This is where my masculinity complex may have come in. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed that another man had to step up and take care of my girlfriend when I was standing right there. \n\nThe next day when we went to order food and Jon approached the register, I flagged down manager (who we are friends with) and asked that someone other than Jon takes our order. I explained the situation to the manager, and Jon was fired by the end of the week.\n\nMy girlfriend is furious with me. She says it was selfish of me to get someone fired because I felt emasculated by some stranger in a fast food restaurant. That I used my position of power to get a kid who didn\u2019t know any better fired. I just feel pretty guilty about the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting a man fired over my masculinity complex?\n\nEdit: I should note that I\u2019m inclined to believe that Jon genuinely thought what he was doing was funny. He was never out right harsh with my girlfriend, he thought it was joke. He usually followed it with something like \u201cyou gotta have fun where you can\u201d", "created_utc": 1668015837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqpwsp/aita_for_getting_a_man_fired_over_my_masculinity/", "score": 2644, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jon was bullying your GF and she decided she was ok with it, for whatever reason. That was her choice. You chose to do something about it, knowing that was against your GF\u2019s wishes. The question is whether you did the right thing or not. I believe you did. How your GF feels about it it\u2019s her issue. From what you wrote it has nothing to do with \u201cmasculinity\u201d. How you react to bullies it\u2019s on the person and has nothing to do with your sex. Do you still believe you did the right thing? If yes, NTA.", "NTA, I don't think this has anything to do with a \"masculinity complex\". The kid was being a jerk, he absolutely does \"know better\", and he was doing a bad job, wasting time and annoying customers. \n\nI'm a little concerned for your GF, being so non-confrontational that she couldn't tell this guy to knock it off and wouldn't even allow you to tell this guy to knock it off. We women are used to being socialized to always be \"polite\" but she deserves better for herself.", "NTA - that wasn't a masculinity complex - your girlfriend needs to stand up for herself. He deserved to be fired. Anyone else would have complained long before it got to that point.", "NTA. He did his thing, and eventually found out. If you're a dick to your customers, customers complain. I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nIf anything, you took too long.", "NTA.  You didn't get him fired, you called attention to his behavior and his manager fired him.  His conduct was clearly offensive and in no way should your gf have put up with it.  Yes you should have said something earlier but that does not make you TA here, Jon is.", "NTA. You didn't get him fired. His own unprofessional behavior got him fired by his manager. I don't get the impression that this was a masculinity complex thing either, it just sounds like seeing somebody else step up gave you the impetus to step up as well.", "In what world is that kind of behaviour flirting??? This is more like bullying.", "NTA. Talk to your girlfriend tough. One thing is to be non confrontational, another is to take abuse from a little jerk on the daily, to the point of avoiding eating at a place she likes because said jerk would accost her. Saying this as a woman. She should be able to stand up for herself in these situations.\nETA: the only way I could understand her resistance to confrontation is if she thought the guy was neurodivergent. But I don\u2019t want to be one those people who diagnose others so I\u2019ll leave it here as a thought.", "NTA regardless if it was a mascilinity issue jon needed to go", "NTA \n\nI don't see how any of that is related either to a masculinity complex nor flirting \n\nIf your gf really think you acted out of jealousy, I think you should probably talk with her about the fact that, maybe watching your significant other being humiliated over and over and feeling miserable is simply something you didn't want to see anymore ? \n\nThis guy was just being an insufferable jerk to your another human being and watching this going on over and over would drive nuts pretty much anyone with any form of empathy\n\nThis was some horrendous level of unprofessionalism, had anyone do that to me ONCE in a restaurant I'd not let things go so easily", "NTA. Jon got himself fired for being an AH and unprofessional.", "There's a couple of things going on here:\n\n* Jon was behaving inappropriately and doing his job poorly    \n* His behavior was upsetting your GF, but she refused to say anything herself and also didn't want you saying anything.     \n* Someone else felt obligated to call out Jon's behavior and you felt emasculated because that should have been your role as the boyfriend.  \n* Jon was fired\n\nfirst off, Jon was fired for his workplace behavior.  You have no idea if your GF was the only person he acted that way towards, and it's unlikely to be so.  The 20 year old \"corporate finance\" guy isn't exactly slinging around a massive amount of corporate clout that's intimidating the store manager into firing people.  \n\nWhy did your GF dislike the behavior, but refuse to do or allow anyone to do anything about it?  that's something only she can explain, I got no help for you there.    \n\nthe emasculating part is all in your head.  You were respecting her wishes to not get into the mix, and a random stranger who was not obligated to stay out of it stepped in.  Nobody was wrong here (except Jon).\n\nit's a tough call....you're kind of in the wrong because you stepped in when your GF asked you not to, but at the same time she doesnt get to forbid you to ignore something that was absolutely negatively impacting your own life, and nothing said or done was untrue.\n\nSo I'm going with overall NTA, but I'm a bit amused at \"used my position of power\" which is honestly an amusing mental image.", "NTA the only thing you did wrong was not doing it sooner. Your GF is wrong to be mad at you, the asshole deserved to be fired.", "Nta, you didn't get him fired, his actions got him fired! And for her to say he probably didn't know better is just BS he's what 17? He knows right from wrong. Your gf is an AH to herself for allowing that behavior to continue. I guess you should've anonymously reported him. or pulled the manager aside and told them to sit back in the curtains to see this behavior himself instead of telling him what's going on yourself.", "NTA\n\nThe only way you\u2019re an AH here, is for waiting as long as you did. It is embarrassing that someone else had to stand up for someone you\u2019re with.\n\nHe got himself fired. Nothing to do with flirting/harassment/masculinity, he was a horrible cashier. He literally wasn\u2019t doing his job.", "NTA\n\nHe wasn't flirting with your girlfriend, he was harassing her. You did the right thing by reporting him.", "NTA it's not at all a \"masculinity complex\" to be offended by seeing a man harassing a woman to distraction. It's not a man thing or a woman thing, it's a human thing.", "NTA. He should have been fired long before. That is unprofessional behavior by any stretch.\n\nHe KNEW better and CHOSE to do it. You weren't being emasculated, your girlfriend was being treated unprofessionally as a CUSTOMER of the establishment. The fact you work there is irrelevant.", "NTA. I\u2019m non confrontational, I hate telling people to stop when they play those games with me because it feels uncomfortable. That being said, I\u2019m confused why your girlfriend would be so uncomfortable but want him to keep his job there. If he\u2019s 17, he SHOULD know better than to waste the restaurants money on purposeful mistakes and tease customers.", "NTA for getting him fired, he deserved it\nbut yta for not saying something sooner.", "NTA for getting him fired since he's only 17 but YTA for not doing something the first time. What he was doing wasn't flirting but bordering harassing your girlfriend who was just trying to order food.", "NTA. His behavior was wildly inappropriate. May this be a lesson to him. Actions have consequences.", "NTA. What took you so long? You can only put up with childish stuff like this for so long. It has nothing to do with masculinity, and everything to do with standing up for your GF. Your GF must have enjoyed it though if that was her teaction.", "NTA and honestly I\u2019m going to say your gf is a pushover, that doesn\u2019t spell good things for her, you should talk about it. I get non confrontational, I\u2019m this way, but come on, show some backbone! And she shouldn\u2019t be mad at you because you stand up for her, that\u2019s just misplaced repressed anger.", "YTA for not doing something sooner. Who taught this man being openly disrespectful is how you flirt? I'd see tossing her extra cookies not messing up her order or not taking it properly on purpose. Also, his behavior is ridiculous and inappropriate. Someone should be fired for behaving like that. As a female bartender if I that aggressively flirted with or disrespected a guest I'd be canned immediately. The only thing wrong here is that this was allowed to go on so long. It only reinforces to men making women uncomfortable is no big deal.", "Nta. Should have spoken with the manager in the beginning. This is this kids own fault for his rude behavior and bad customer service. If the manager fired him this quickly then there must have been more issue other then this one.", "NTA. It was sexual harrassment. It doesn't' matter if it was directed to you or not. You felt uncomfortable and you should have reported it to HR immediately. As for the GF, she has clearly been taught to go along with the patriarchy and not rock the boat.", "NTA. Where the fuck did he learn to flirt, first grade?", "NTA.  Jon got Jon fired.  Dollars to donuts there have been many other complaints about Jon from other diners.  The manager knows you and believes you and your complaint might have been just one too many for the manager.\n\nNTA.  I would have been embarrassed also if the guy behind me stepped up when I had not.", "Overall, I\u2019d say NTA, but you get about 1 out of 5 As because you really should have reported his harassment sooner.", "NTA for getting him fired, but you could have also, I don\u2019t know, tried harder? You gently told him off once and it didn\u2019t change. Maybe try again but not so gently? Or just order your food together? That way you\u2019re not just sending your gf in to do battle alone.", "I think this is a net NTA.  Your motivations seemed to be more about competing with Jon (you call him a kid but you are all within a few years of each others' ages) and feeling emasculated by the other guy sticking up for your girlfriend. In addition, your GF--the victim here--asked you not to do anything. \n\nUltimately, though, you did right by Jon.  He needs to learn this is not appropriate workplace behavior or a means of interacting with customers.  You tried to gently tell him off, and he didn't listen--so he had to learn the hard way by losing his job.", "It should also be noted that my girlfriend thought that Jon likely had some sort of mental handicap, and that was part of the reason she was so insistent I don\u2019t interfere. I do see now though that this was really no excuse and I should\u2019ve been more harsh despite her requests.", "ESH\n\nThe behavior you describe is not Jon \"flirting\" - it's grossly inappropriate behavior towards  a fellow employee. Jon is sexually harassing your gf. That deserves being fired. It would have been better if management could have addressed this earlier - most of Jon's issues seem to be associated with being an immature teenager who hasn't been taught how to behave, and a sharp correction early might have modified his behavior.\n\nYou are, however, an AH for your ridiculous feelings of emasculation.", "Esh yu only said something bc of someone came to her rescue instead of yu", "YTA for only defending your gf when someone else steps up to do it. You could have told the guy to knock it off without being a dick at anytime or asked for another person to take y\u2019all\u2019s order previously to this. The fact that you only did it because you were emasculated and then you went slightly nuclear makes you TAH.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA for getting him fired but YTA towards lack of help with your girlfriend. \n\nWhy couldn\u2019t you just had asked for the straw / sauce/ ordered her food whatever. Why did you leave her to and even worse watch her have to interact with him all the time. She was obviously so uncomfortable she didn\u2019t want to return.

He might have been jealous or had feelings of his own insecurities, but none of that matters.  \n\nShould this ever happen again, ask to speak to a manager, immediately.  His behavior was everything a fast food clerk should NOT be displaying.  He was rude and inappropriate to customers, period.  \n\nNo need to feel guilty....either one of you.

Every person who walked in that restaurant was being impacted by the atmosphere being created in the place and the attitudes that were being allowed to fester. If I witnessed that behavior, I wouldn't want to go in there either and would feel uneasy about patronizing a place where it was clearly allowed. Can you think of yourself as also standing up for the people-women and men or whomever-who were being directly addressed by Jon or uneasy (if not directly targeted) but for whatever reason didn't feel safe confronting it or reporting it?

The GF doesn't get to determine the whole course of action for others who were being impacted by Jon, nor does she get to determine what OP does in response to that kind of behavior in general.

Abusers keep pushing the envelope to see what they can get away with and will escalate if they are not called out and held to consequences.

Even if they don't target the more extreme behaviors at women in a more privileged position (white, middle class or above, or with potential connections/influence) they might aim them at more vulnerable women who would be less likely to reach out for help or to be believed if they do. I've been in the GF's place-reluctant to confront someone or potentially destroy their lives by getting them fired \"simply\" because I was being harassed or threatened in some way (I didn't think I was \"worth\" any concern).

In general, I don't believe that mental illness/disability should be a free pass to threaten people or treat them badly and I try to operate on that, rather than my personal discomfort about destroying a vulnerable person's livelihood. It's a difficult thing to do, as it involves unlearning decades of social conditioning not to make a fuss, years of lessons that any harassment is somehow my fault or that I \"asked for it\" in some way, plus any kinds of personal traumas that can compound it all.

I assumed it was just the boyfriend who was being called an AH based on the comment I was replying to, but it sounds like you're saying that everyone who didn't speak up actually shares equal responsibility for them all collectively being an AH.\n\nI guess I just don't see how calling people assholes is going to make the world a better place or make people want to call out bigotry.

Your girlfriend is WAY too generous about how she lets people treat her, and one day that's going to bite her in the ass in a big way.  As for Jon, he deserved to be fired a long time ago.  If I were the manager and you'd told me all that, I would have fired him same day after confirming that was what he did, because that kind of behavior is completely unacceptable.  \"He doesn't know any better.\"  Yeah - now he does.  Your GF needs therapy so she doesn't get walked all over as she goes through life.  You two are only 20 and 21 now - just wait and see how much harder it gets, and see what happens when you actually encounter people that will take serious advantage of you.  Your GF is a prime mark, narcissists and sociopaths LOVE meeting people like here because she'll be so easily manipulated.  Read \"The Gift of Fear\" by Gavin de Becker, and watch \"Speak No Evil\" (2022).  This was just a rude guy; wait until it's someone who will lie, steal or kill for profit.  Your girlfriend's attitude here is no joking matter.", "ESH. The guy is awful and needed to be fired. We all know that. \n\nBut.  BUT! Your \"masculinity complex\" is the most childish thing I have read in a long time. Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you. You felt emasculated because some dude in line was tired of waiting for the cashier to help him while the cashier was being an ass to another customer.

Grow the fuck up.", "NTA for stepping in when someone else noted it and also said it was wrong. Your girlfriend would be making you out to be a villain even more if you were the one who had initiated that confrontation, so I'm glad that stranger stepped in to talk about how wrong that was.\n\nIt really just seems that what you need to do as her partner right now is insist that she get professional help. She was being fully harassed and she wouldn't speak up, and would also not allow you to speak up for her. That is a serious problem and she needs professional help to deal with it, because not only is it non-functional for her, her asking you to just stand by and watch her be harassed is wrong.

I would jump the counter take my own straw and sauce, then flip  back over and hurt myself because I'm an idiot. He was being elementary with his \"flirting\", this was just plain mean, not to mention doing it after she was clearly uncomfortable, which a  worker should be able to recognize, is breaching harrassment.

It's a good thing that he got fired for his action.", "wow. this is unhinged.", "Also your girlfriend needs to realize that his behaviour was unacceptable, and that you telling him off is how he learns to be better.

She's not doing a favor for any woman, anywhere.", "That's a valid point, but I feel like there were other people who experienced similar or that the kid was already on the final step, because if this was the first complaint,  I can't see them firing him. \n\nBut this kid. I wouldn't have gotten this far and not ripped him a new one. \n\nOP, your girlfriend needs to learn how to deal with stuff like this.

I work in fastfood. Work with a lot of high schoolers. There is definitely a lot of playing and teasing going around, but it is not like what is happening in the post. Throwing sauce packets and playing keep away? Yeah that is a very common situation. But there is a very important distinction that needs to be recognized. OP and the gf are office staff, not restaurant workers. Essentially they are just  regulars at the restaurant. They aren't spending hours together working with Jon. They aren't learning acceptable playing and boundaries with people around to tell them when a line is crossed and can be immediately addressed. Jon was just harassing a customer. I would say that is a failure of training, but frankly I couldn't imagine any of our high schoolers thinking this was ok to do to a customer.", "Yeah, the manager is the real AH in this situation.

Why on earth would ground zero for a fast food place put up with that kind of employee behavior, that particular restaurant should be the pristine example of what your franchisees are expected to do.  Like, I normally wouldn't ever buy a pre-made packaged salad from a gas station, but where I used to work, the gas station down the street was a Meijer gas station, and the Meijer HQ was literally across the street and everything in that gas station was clean, and the food fresh.

He wasn't fired in that moment that you complained.  He was fired later in the week.  I'm guessing that your complaint wasn't the only one that the manager received.  17 years old is still pretty childish in a lot of ways, but it's old enough to know how to act when you are working.  Dude was still acting like he was a kid who could get away with anything.  Dude found out that's not how the world works.\n\nAlso, these things you give as evidence of this guy flirting with your gf sound like asshole moves.  The thing with the straw might be playful, and maybe these are things that you just have to see in context to fully understand, but they sound like jerky things to do to someone... ignoring them, refusing to serve them, throwing things at them, charging her for things she didn't order, getting her order wrong all the time... just no... these are horrible ways to behave, and if he acted that way with other people as well, it's no wonder he got fired.", "NTA.  Are you sure GF didn't know him before?  For someone who is so non-confrontational, she really got confrontational with you.  \n\nI don't read this as threatened masculinity.  You showed some corporate responsibility when another patron complained and you told the shift supervisor.

Although I'd ask your girlfriend how Jon was supposed to learn to be better if she never informed him he was wrong, and didn't let anyone else inform him he was wrong.  It wasn't a kindness to him to let this go for so long.  In avoiding confrontation she let the situation escalate until there was really no option but to let the kid go because he was fucking up his job so badly it was affecting multiple people.\n\nI don't think this was about a \"masculinity complex.\"  This was about being put in a really tough position by someone you care about.  You could either stand by and watch her be hurt, or you could step in and have her be angry.  She put you in a lose-lose situation and that's a pretty shitty thing to do to someone she supposedly cares about.", "NTA - that is egregiously bad customer service.  It was to the point where she didn\u2019t even want to go there any more.  That\u2019s essentially harassment. And he was persistent to the point that other customers were getting inconvenienced and annoyed. He needed to be hauled up short for the good of the business.\n\nYour girlfriend is being an asshole too.  Putting it on you for feeling \u201cemasculated \u201c is deeply unfair.  That would be about as unfair as accusing her of liking the attention. I wonder how she would appreciate being accused of flirting with him.

The guy got fired because he was not doing his job.  sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA. That is not flirting, that\u2019s being a jerk. Ask your girl if she thought it was flirting.

The manager firing him was a consequence for his actions; all you did was update him on what they were. \n\nKeep in mind, this was your dining experience too.

You needed a stranger to do it first, so you finally step up. No excuses, for that YTA", "NTA. It sounded more like he hated her rather than liked her. That is some psychotic and unacceptable behavior and you were right to tell a manager. I am confused as to why she would condone this behavior though. Some people at just too nice.", "NTA. It's fine if your gf didn't want to complain directly but she wasn't the only one being impacted by that asshat's behaviour.

I'm willing to bet you that your gf has not been not his only target and that you were not the first or last complaint.\n\n\"He probably didn't know better\" is a poor excuse for a 5 yo, let alone 17. This isn't just basic manners, this is \"don't be an egregious asshole to other people\". He doesn't treat you that way, he didn't treat the other customer that way - he targeted a shy, pretty girl. He knows. Even if he doesn't, the way to make sure he learns is to complain. If he doesn't learn after that then he lost his job himself. Surely someone who knows how to treat people with respect deserves a job as well, so why would you not want your company represented by that person and know that your customers and fellow employees are no longer being insulted, abused and harassed?\n\nIt was also very unfair of her to suggest his behaviour emasculated you. Like, in what world is a responsible respectful adult who tries to balance respecting his loved one's wishes while still trying to speak up against egregiously bad behaviour in public being emasculated by a mean, underdeveloped 17yo?", "NTA. He said he had to get his fun where he could? His fun is bullying and teasing someone he knows will not confront him? He would have gotten fired the first time he did this to me. He's an obnoxious little rat that cannot even work a fast food job without bothering someone to the point that they don't even want to look at him? Little troll deserved to be fired.

No real way around that", "NTA no you got the kid fired because he was acting like an asshat that is bullying customers because he can (she was letting him get away with it) nowhere at any job is that behavior going to be tolerated. she was so uncomfortable that she was skipping meals and wanting to avoid him. that is wrong. he deserved to be fired. \n\nik shes shy and asked you not to, but you should have done this sooner BECAUSE you're in a position of power and it makes the establishment look bad, he did this IN FRONT of other customers.", "NTA\n  \nI'm thinking that there were other things that this guy did. \n  \nIs it possible to be fired for s*xual harrassment (which seems like what this guy was doing), yes. But it either has to be an ongoing thing or one egregious act.\n  \nThe key to either being that your GF would have had to be part of the complaint. Not just be part of someone else's complaint. She needs to confirm what happened. \n  \nI'm guessing the manager kept an eye on him for the rest of the week and noticed a pattern of behavior that was problematic.\n  \nOR this guy was already on the manager's radar, and this was the last straw.\n  \nEither way, nta.\n  \nYou can have fun at work, but you gotta make sure everyone is having fun.

But they are responsible for how they react to kind behavior. Rejecting and shaming legitimate help (not the hold the door bs but like what you did, stopping a bully) is about the stupidest most unhelpful self-inflicting thing a victim can do.

You let your girlfriend be repeatedly harassed by a colleague, you never encouraged or supported her to tell him to knock it off, you never told him to knock it off yourself, you never took his behaviour to his line manager, you never took his behaviour to HR/Corporate and you let a customer, gender irrelevant, call out his unprofessional behaviour. You have bigger problems that a fragile make ego but the upside is that you'll be single and fired pretty soon so you will have plenty of time to work on it.", "Nta for going to the manager, you are however, ta for not ever doing or saying anything when all this was going on for so long.", "NTA.

Why did it take so long for you to say anything too ?", "Yes, you are the a-hole.  He was a 17-year-old kid.  He sounds like he might have been a bit on the spectrum . . . not getting social cues.  His job may have been one of the things that he enjoyed and gave him a sense of worth.  He wasn't hateful, harsh or downright mean.  He was     just annoying and didn't realize it.\n\nI don't know why we've turned into a world where people cannot just politely confront someone when there is an issue, with \"politely\" being the key word.  You could have said something like, \"I know you are just teasing her, but the attention bothers her and me.  Do you mind toning it down a bit?\"  He may have needed that directness to know he had crossed a line and was irritating.  Instead, you got him fired.  The confrontation with the man might have even started to do the trick, but you didn't even wait to see, and instead, made a scene and got him fired.

Some men might do it because they feel women need to be defended, but normal people defend their loved ones, not only women.\n\nIf she allows this disrespect, and doesn't let him do anything, she is also forcing him in the position of an ass that doesn't care about his gf. That is why the stranged stepped up, he probably thought OP was an ass. Everyone that saw that situation thought OP was an ass. We know there are people that are bad at confrontation so we expect the loved ones to have those people backs.\n\nShe wasn't doing anything, she started to avoid going to eat there. That is not handling the situation. That is just ridiculous. Especially if you don't let your loved ones do anything.\n\nFinally, whatever her feelings may be, as everyone have said, that is a place of work. The guy was downright bullying her in a public manner. All customers were being affected by it. I doubt he was flirting, it is more like some people have a \"won't do anything about it\" detector, that let's them find people like OPs girlfriend easily. So more likely than not he was doing it to other people. But she didnt do anything and didn't let her bf do anything about it. This situation was bad for the company she was working for. Some companies have the policy that everyone in the company is responsible for the good image and name of the company. She was going against that kind of principle.\n\nI think OP should have talked to his gf and said if you don't do something I will, because this doesn't only affect you. And then give the gf a chance to do something. If she didn't he had to step up. \n\nIf is funny how the gf doesn't like confrontation but has no issue basically insulting OP. She was in the wrong. OP shouldn't have let things go this far, but he tried to do what she asked from him, even it was really against the best interests of everyone, including his.\n\nThe kid got himself fired. I mean I doubt they fired him because he teased her that one time, I bet there were talks and they found out he was doing this to other people, or he was not doing other parts of his job right. Seriously doubt it was because OP \"used his power\".\n\nNTA. I think OP should show this post to his gf, because she was pretty much in the wrong here.", "Nope, no no no sister. You don't let an addict keep shooting up, you don't hand the alcoholic another can, you don't enable your loved ones' desire or complacency for some kind of hurt, whether it be physical or emotional. If someone is bleeding out, you don't continue on your way. If someone is being harrassed, you don't wait until you get a signal to intervene. \n\nOP wasn't trying to hold the door for her or infantilizing her by refusing to let her do basic independent stuff like driving or cooking. He stopped a bully from hurting her, and did so in a calm adult manner by speaking to the manager and letting that person do their job. He did what *any* person of *any* gender would and should have done. Jon's behavior was gross, and the GF was allowing that harm to happen again and again.\n\nIf you saw someone being abused by their spouse and they told you to do nothing, is that what you're gonna do, nothing? Because it seems like that's what you're going for, arguing that victims shouldn't be helped until they ask for it.", "Flirting is slipping someone extra chicken nuggets, not charging them extra for food they didn\u2019t order or not giving them food they did order.", "??? WTF does that even mean?", "It's also objectively an issue that affects far more than just her. She can decide she doesn't want to be involved, but other people get to have opinions too. Jon's behavior was just as disrespectful to OP and all the other customers and co-workers you know he pulled similar shit on and all of them also have a right to speak up about it.", "Where was the manager this whole time?", "How long is he supposed to be allowed to get away with this, regardless of who he's doing it to, since it's obvious that if he's not going to be stopped by someone in a position of power over him.  He's just going see how far he can get away with it in other situations and other people.  OP's gf was just letting him get away with entitlement, which is why we're in a lot of the situations we're in today.", "This sub likes to treat anyone under 18 as being an innocent nairce little child who couldn't possibly know any better. 17 is plenty old enough to know that that's not behavior you do with a customer", "Especially as I don\u2019t buy he didn\u2019t know. He only targeted Op\u2019s girlfriend. He doesn\u2019t do this to anyone else? No he knows better; a ten year year old knows better. He keep escalating because the girlfriend refused to end the behavior because she was more concerned about him being fired than he was", ">  It went on for so long that the man in line behind us stepped up to tell Jon off.\n\nLet's also not downplay his behavior wasn't just teasing but was bad enough to affect other customers. I'm sorry but 17 years old know better than this. He deserved to be fired.", "I worked w multiple teenagers for 4 years, they all knew better than to behave as such. And they all started from 15 years. \n\nWhat he did was inappropriate and possibly done towards other women who didn\u2019t step up out of fear. \n\nSo him getting fired is just a consequence of his inability to behave properly. He is more than old enough to understand how one behaves at work.", "I worked fast food in high school, and nobody had to tell me or any of my classmates to _not throw sauce packets at customers._", "Since he got fired, he probably did this to a lot of pretty girls.", "We can't know he only targeted OP's Gf.

Your girlfriend liked the attention and the flirting, and that is the real problem, nothing having to do with you \"abusing your authority\".", "NTA. The GF says \"he doesn't know better\", but he does, that's why he's not doing it to anyone else. GF is enabling his behaviour by letting it be and not telling the boy to stop. He's too old to do things like this, especially with people he's not close with.", "NTA - it must be so frustrating to have to watch that. Macho masculinity or what, no one wants to have to watch that. It's childish and really unprofessional. I'm glad he's gone.", "NTA the kid was bullying and harassing her. It was deliberate cruelty and by all accounts he was enjoying it. \n\nPeople are right that your girlfriend would benefit from some counselling and learning about boundaries and how to speak up for herself. It's true that an inability to hold other people responsible for their actions, even in extreme circumstances, will continue to have negative impacts on her life.", "ESH. Someone should have said something a long time ago. How little does your GF value her time that she would allow someone to waste it like that? Why would you think it's okay for someone to throw things at anyone, much less your girlfriend? Why would you allow this little jerk to control your lunch break and ruin it for others, too? The man that stood up to him embarrassed you out of a stupor.", "NTA\n\nOP, you felt a little ashamed because somebody else stepped in AFTER your girlfriend told you not to. It\u2019s natural to feel a little ashamed because honestly, you\u2019re beating yourself up thinking that you should have done the right thing even if it ticked her off. Now you\u2019re worried that a good action has been tainted because it followed someone else doing it first. And I have been there, believe me.\n\nSo no, you didn\u2019t do it because of a masculinity complex. You did it because this kid, despite being told off, was continuing to be a poor employee and bothering your confrontation-fearing GF. He knew his behaviour was wrong, your GF was suffering from it but unwilling to do anything, you just did what she should have done a long time ago. And she probably isn\u2019t the only one that he does it to.", "NTA You *did not* get a guy fired. You reported absolutely awful customer service that negatively impacted your girlfriend ABD other customers. Most likely, she isn't the only customer Jon did this too. The manager *chose* to fire Jon because he was clearly had no sense of professionalism.", "NTA.\n\nWhen you're young, you may find it uncomfortable setting a boundary on how people should treat you.\n\nNow you've learnt that when a female is being manipulated, you should speak up if it's physically safe for all parties involved. Jon was right to lose his job. He wasn't behaving professionally and your GF probably isn't the only woman he's harassed.\n\nYou should also consider encouraging to your gf to speak up for herself more. The little giggle and laugh entices crazy men to believe it's flirtation instead of being brushed off.", "YTA not for getting him fired but for letting him disrespect you like that for so long.\n \nJust because your girlfriend either didn't want to offend anyone or enjoyed the attention or a bit of both. When you are with her it is an insult to you... and this has nothing to do with gender. \n\nIn your place I would have shut him down verbally on day 1 or day 2 and if that didn't work.... with some mild physical violence.", "NTA. This kid deserved to be fired. He was the only one having fun. This isn't flirting, it's abuse and harassment. He saw that your gf is a doormat, so he enjoyed walking all over her.", "NAH. It was an AH move but it\u2019s like, warranted.

You\u2019re a decent human.\nWhat is wrong with Jon, and what is wrong with your girlfriend?? For real.", "NTA That's not even teasing or flirting that's just bad customer service. Now I am wondering what I am missing cause your nonconfrontational girlfriend seemed to like it enough to confront you about getting him fired.", "NTA This needed to happen a lot sooner. Jon needs to learn that harassment isn't flirting, it's harassment, and you can and should get fired for it.", "NTA don\u2019t know why defending your partner needs to be gender specific.", "NTA.  I doubt your complaint was the first.  Employees generally aren\u2019t fired after one minor complaint, even when it\u2019s from another employee.  Even if your complaint was the first and only, Jon needs to know that the workplace isn\u2019t the appropriate venue for his behavior.  Maybe if your gf had been willing to address it with him before it became a problem for other employees and customers, Jon could have kept his job.", "YTA, for two reasons, you pried her because you didn't act until someone else pointed out this behavior and did something, which you should have done in the first place, and the second because you yourself admit that you had no malicious intentions with your girlfriend, so in Instead of talking to John or asking the manager to fix this more discreetly, you put on a show of not admitting that you failed as a boyfriend.", "Let an old goat help a here. What dipstick Jr there was doing was called immature, disrespectful, and unprofessional. What you were doing was professional, proper (by using the appropriate chain of command) and tolerant.

This guy is a weirdo.", "OP, you did not get this guy fired.   People really need to stop trying to get credit for getting someone fired.  The person got themselves fired.  His actions with your GF got him fired.", "NTA", "I guess it's called flirting in the same manner when boys in kindergarten pull the girls' hair. \"Aaaaww, little Boby just likes you, Suzie, that's why he is hurting you\".\n\nF that noise.", "Also another customer who doesn't work for the company was bothered enough to say something. \n\nThat's the threshold for taking action. \n\nIf girlfriend is too shy to put a stop to it OP isn't wrong for stepping in.\n\nMany shy people are too uncomfortable to take a reasonable action.", "The real insidious problem of \u201che doesn\u2019t know better\u201d or \u201cboys will be boys\u201d is if you don\u2019t correct the behavior at its lowest point, it\u2019ll continue and likely get worse. Maybe not with OP\u2019s girlfriend but with some other girl who doesn\u2019t want to say anything which will give the boy more power. What happens when the kid goes to college, goes to a frat party, drinks a bit too much, and there is a girl there who has also drunk too much. People escalate when they have no consequences. When people don\u2019t say no at the beginning of the problem. Especially idiot college kids.", "The problem is that the GF did nothing to handle it. Maybe the kid could still have his job if she decided to speak up. Or would have lost it sooner lol.", "OP did tell him off.\n\n>At first I tried to gently tell him off, but she told me to stop and leave it be.\n\nBut GF held him back.\n\nAnd no it was not them that got him fired. What if this kid happens to have a crush with a regular who is, at first indifferent of his \"little pranks\" but got fed up after a while? Him being fired was only a matter of time, whether or not they intervened. And his pranking got so out of hand another customer told him off. That could affect the entire restaurant altogether.\n\nETA:\n\n>I explained the situation to the manager, and Jon was fired by the end of the week.\n\nApparently, he did not get fired the instant he explained the matter to the manager. I'm assuming the manager kept an eye on Jon to see if he is acting the same way towards other customers and was found out, which led him to be then fired.", "I will say, when they fired him he probably got the explanation right there. That\u2019s all the explanation someone with this behavior needs. I used to be a restaurant worker too, and if I had done things like throwing the sauce packets at a customer (because OP and GF aren\u2019t coworkers with Jon. They\u2019re customers), I would have been fired on the spot the first time. Managers and coworkers watch a lot more than you\u2019d think, and I\u2019m shocked they didn\u2019t take care of this sooner without OP having to say anything.", "I wonder if there\u2019s something that happened between her and the worker that we or OP don\u2019t know about?

I don't buy for a second this kid thought he was doing nothing wrong. Imo he was passively aggressively going after her because he liked her and she kept coming in with her bf. The more she let him get away with without saying anything, the further he took it. He absolutely should have been fired and this \"boys will be boys\" or \"teenagers will be teenagers\" regarding a 17 year old outright harassing a woman publicly for weeks or months is f'ing insane. This is exactly why men don't behave, because we make excuses for them. Didn't know better my ASS. \n\nThat said, OP is NTA for doing what his gf requested of him but the gf definitely is. She needs some professional help to learn to stand up for herself and have healthy boundaries.", "He also got her orders wrong and charged her for items she didn\u2019t order. That\u2019s just bad customer service.", "Right? Damn. Like sure, the prefrontal cortex doesn\u2019t finish developing until age 25, I get it, but if your self-control development is so poor you can\u2019t keep yourself from throwing stuff at people in public, you aren\u2019t qualified to hold down a customer-facing job."]}
