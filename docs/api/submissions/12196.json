She lost control and hit the barrier. Luckily it was not too bad and the car is drive-able and fixable.\n\nWhen she explained what happened, I told her, I knew that would happen someday and she argued saying that it \"wasn't her fault\". I told her a single vehicle collision is always your fault and that if she had not over corrected, and slowed down gently she would not have lost control or even if she had hit the truck, then it would have been their fault.\n\nThe truck did not stop.\n\nEDIT: Seems like I am the AH, I will apologize. I really meant to say in terms of insurance. Obviously I know the truck initiated it by swerving.

You know what doesn't help anxious drivers? People telling them to stop being anxious drivers. I get anxiety just watching dashcam videos. And some truck drivers are menaces (tbf, some drivers of all vehicles are menaces, it's just more deadly with a semi). The fact the truck didn't stop after swerving shows that he/she was in the wrong. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with making sure or double sure or triple sure. You're just one of those 'Yellow means hurry to beat the red, not slow down-prepare to stop' types. Pausing at a stop sign is not a stop.

YTA", "Why the fuck is that an issue man?", "Yet OP criticizes his girlfriend for an accident that clearly wasn't her fault. How are we to trust she isn't just a decent person on the roads? One of his complaints is that she stops at a stop sign lol", "Except nothing the OP describes indicates his girlfriend is overly timid when driving", "Stopping at stop signs and double checking behind you before you pull out is not being so timid as to be a hazard. OP, YTA", "I understand why you would think overly cautious drivers are a hazard. I get frustrated sometimes when I\u2019m speeding and someone is riding the passing lane at speed limit, but I do understand that I\u2019m actually the hazard and would be at fault in a collision. Great drivers shouldn\u2019t mean skilled race car drivers. We need more drivers to be cautious, myself included.", "*Some* of what OP describes does seem like legit bad and dangerous driving. Pressing the brakes when she notices she is slightly over the speed limit for example can be dangerous or at the very least causes potentially bad situations for people behind them. Some of it is just somewhat annoying like waiting for several seconds at a stop sign. I know it would get to me if I was behind them and I had to wait when they have so much time to go.\n\nThe general tone of the post makes me lean on the side of him not accurately describing her driving. He just seems to be overly annoyed at her cautious driving and its not as bad as he describes.\n\nEdit: For those few people that downvoted, do you really not see a problem with people constantly hitting the brakes when they don't have to? Not even worrying about the people behind them. If you saw someone doing that ahead of you, would you think everything is cool or that the person isn't driving well and maybe give them a bigger cushion than normal?", "I can't trust gf's description of the accident anymore than I trust op's evaluation of her driving.

Really, that's your reasoning?", "The number one aim of insurance companies is to not pay. Of course they claim it\u2019s yours and everyone else\u2019s fault so they don\u2019t have to do so. Anyone without a dash-cam these days is mad.", "While the driver is pretty much always going to be deemed at fault in a single car accident, that does not automatically make her a bad driver. Do you even like her? Because it sounds like this turned out pretty mild. If the truck would have hit her it would have been worse.", "That's not even what you're claiming I'm your OP. You're trying to tell her that her actions could have prevented the accident. That's completely different than the insurance company might find you at fault.

Go apologize and not one of those fake apologies like \"I'm sorry you got mad but I meant the insurance company\". \n\nThat wasn't your intent and you know it", "This isn\u2019t universally true by any means.", "Why does that make her a bad driver? She reacted and avoided an accident with another driver. If she hadn't, then you'd say she's a bad driver bc of her reflexes.\n\nAnyway, the entire ordeal sounds so stressful. I'm always nervous passing a truck, because ... simple Newtonian physics. I wish you showed more empathy for something that happened to her that out of her control. She went from 60 to 0 in mere seconds, thinking \"here's where I die.\" And all you have to say is this post and your bullshit redemption.", ">\u201cif the truck hit her it wouldn\u2019t be her fault\u201d\n\nAnd she would probably be injured. I dunno about OP, but when I'm driving I am far more concerned about keeping myself *safe* than I am about any potential legal or insurance ramifications. \n\nIt's why I try to get away from tailgating drivers and why I am always scanning for my safest exit in case someone else swerves into my lane, etc. I don't care that where I live the person who hits you from behind is always at fault by default. I don't want to get hit in the first place. Getting hit from behind often causes whiplash and I don't want that.\n\nGetting sideswiped by a fuckin semi truck?? That is gonna hurt a lot more than swerving into the median to avoid it.", "Many states have police reports that assign fault.

And like she wants to follow the law so she doesn't get a ticket. OP sounds like he's damn near a maniac on the road if those are his only complaints.

You're supposed to let off the gas to slow down and not use the brakes if you don't have to.\n\nSame with the stop sign. I don't know if you drive in places that see a lot of high traffic or not, but people being overly cautious causes traffic because they wait for a \"perfect\" chance to proceed. There's a flow to traffic and people like OP interrupt it even if \"technically\" they are doing right. Plenty of people technically speed but unless the cop is a fucking massive asshole, they don't pull over everybody that goes 2 mph over the speed limit.
