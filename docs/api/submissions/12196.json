She lost control and hit the barrier. Luckily it was not too bad and the car is drive-able and fixable.\n\nWhen she explained what happened, I told her, I knew that would happen someday and she argued saying that it \"wasn't her fault\".

The fact the truck didn't stop after swerving shows that he/she was in the wrong. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with making sure or double sure or triple sure. You're just one of those 'Yellow means hurry to beat the red, not slow down-prepare to stop' types. Pausing at a stop sign is not a stop.

OP, YTA", "I understand why you would think overly cautious drivers are a hazard. I get frustrated sometimes when I\u2019m speeding and someone is riding the passing lane at speed limit, but I do understand that I\u2019m actually the hazard and would be at fault in a collision. Great drivers shouldn\u2019t mean skilled race car drivers. We need more drivers to be cautious, myself included.", "*Some* of what OP describes does seem like legit bad and dangerous driving. Pressing the brakes when she notices she is slightly over the speed limit for example can be dangerous or at the very least causes potentially bad situations for people behind them. Some of it is just somewhat annoying like waiting for several seconds at a stop sign. I know it would get to me if I was behind them and I had to wait when they have so much time to go.\n\nThe general tone of the post makes me lean on the side of him not accurately describing her driving. He just seems to be overly annoyed at her cautious driving and its not as bad as he describes.\n\nEdit: For those few people that downvoted, do you really not see a problem with people constantly hitting the brakes when they don't have to? Not even worrying about the people behind them. If you saw someone doing that ahead of you, would you think everything is cool or that the person isn't driving well and maybe give them a bigger cushion than normal?", "I can't trust gf's description of the accident anymore than I trust op's evaluation of her driving.

She reacted and avoided an accident with another driver. If she hadn't, then you'd say she's a bad driver bc of her reflexes.\n\nAnyway, the entire ordeal sounds so stressful.

I dunno about OP, but when I'm driving I am far more concerned about keeping myself *safe* than I am about any potential legal or insurance ramifications. \n\nIt's why I try to get away from tailgating drivers and why I am always scanning for my safest exit in case someone else swerves into my lane, etc. I don't care that where I live the person who hits you from behind is always at fault by default. I don't want to get hit in the first place. Getting hit from behind often causes whiplash and I don't want that.\n\nGetting sideswiped by a fuckin semi truck??

You're supposed to let off the gas to slow down and not use the brakes if you don't have to.\n\nSame with the stop sign.

HOWEVER, that \"overly cautious\" limit is pretty extreme, and not what OP is describing. \n\nFor instance, going 30 mph on a 80 mph stretch of highway for no obvious reason (so a full 50 mph UNDER the speed limit, and under what other cars are doing) is dangerous (saw this the other day, hence the example). Other cars are going to be assuming you are moving at roughly the same speed as traffic, so assuming you're +/- 10mph of the speed limit and will likely approach too quickly until they're close enough that they notice the speed difference and closing rate. That's why disabled or limited able cars (like in failsafe mode or on a mini spare, for example) are supposed to (at least where I live) use hazard lights. So they have a visual indicator of \"abnormal behavior happening with this car\". That helps give other drivers enough of a heads up that they have time to move or slow down or otherwise avoid the danger without having to do any sudden maneuvers. \n\nBraking to a full stop on a road to go over say, a small crack, can also be dangerous. Other cars may not be expecting you to stop suddenly. They *should* give enough room that they avoid hitting you anyway, but brake checking will still be the fault of the braking driver (sometimes partially split with following too closely for the hitting driver). \n\nA lesser but super annoying example is hazards in the rain. It doesn't help you be seen, and many hazards override turn signals, so now other cars don't know which direction or lane you are trying to move to. Just normal headlights and/or fog lights, and steady, controlled movements with proper signals is a lot safer. \n\nThat's the sort of unpredictable behavior that, while in theory is cautious, can actually be very dangerous.

The point is that \u201cShe stops at STOP sings\u201d is unequivocally not the issue and it is disingenuous to claim otherwise", "Seems awfully convenient to take tall the others at face value and not that one", "I can list some real bad driver attributes that my mother has.\n- she drives well over the speed limit unless she is tailgating someone and she gets way too close\n- she insists on making eye contact with passengers when she is talking, even on windy roads\n- she stops inches from the person in front of her when stopped at a light or something else\n- she guns it out of parking spots when she thinks the coast is clear\n- she won\u2019t even slow down at a stop sign if she thinks the coast is clear.\n- she has recently started to just run red lights if she doesn\u2019t see people coming. I told her husband about it when that started happening. \n- there are other things", "If someone makes the choice to illegally take right of way because someone is taking a few seconds to make sure it's clear... that's not the safe driver's problem.", "No ticket means the police didn't find any fault/law breaking in her driving.\n\nInsurance companies are designed to make money and pay out as little as they can. \n\nYou're a complete AH. YTA.", "Because right next to them is the best place for them to spot you and there's one magic spot to sit and wait in. \n\nNo, I try to stay in their mirror view for a little before passing them for long enough to think they've spotted me. They can see behind with those big mirrors well but not right up next to them.", "I dated someone like this. I'm not saying it was the reason I broke up with him but it was one of a laundry list of things that after about a year and a half I just couldn't take anymore.", "How is it convenient? He has a problem with her looking around a parking lot, he has an issue with her \u201cstopping for a few seconds\u201d, etc. so yeah I\u2019ll take the \u201cbreaking\u201d one with a grain of salt. I highly doubt she\u2019s breaking. She\u2019s probably slowing down and he doesn\u2019t like that.", "Took me wayyyy too long to realize you meant \u201cscoots\u201d as in \u201cuses a scooter\u201d and not as in either \u201cdoing the boot-scootin boogie\u201d or \u201cdragging his butt along the ground.\u201d Just sharing this moment that made me very confused and amused.", "It took me WAY too long to figure out what \"scoots\" meant.  In My head i was picturing a square of plastic with 4 castor wheels you'd sit on and scoot around in grade school", "I even stay stopped for a few seconds after the light turns green (if I'm at the front), because I've seen way too many people blow through their red lights.", "If you get pissed because you have to wait three seconds, sounds like a personal problem.... \n\nI care much more about my own safety than the feelings of impatient drivers.", "Because this sub has a hard on for demonizing people the moment they have an iota of reason to do so", "Everyone thinkdls they're a good driver.  Most people are wrong.  Timid and indecisive is just as bad as aggressive. \n\nThree seconds is not a standard.  Yield right of way, and exercise right of way when it's yours.  Not whenever you get around to it, or when you're done with your phone call.", "I dont think OP ever quite understood why they were AH - at least thats why they got my downvotes.", "lmao it's not \"timid\" to make sure no one is running a stop sign. I've seen a shit ton of accidents from people going immediately on green at stop lights and going as soon as it's their turn at stop signs... it's always a better option to wait a few seconds. Your feelings are not more important than actual safety. \n\nAlso, it's illegal to go out-of-turn at a stop sign, regardless of whether or not someone is waiting a few seconds to make sure everyone is actually stopped.", "I'm thinking maybe you shouldn't drive.", "Really? Judging by their comments they seem quite aware, saying they will apologize, thanking people for articles about apologizing, acknowledging his partners intelligence.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter to you, you\u2019ll still downvote people saying they\u2019re gonna apologize? Why?", "I was in an accident that was my fault (I've told the story elsewhere on this thread, basically lost control on wet roads) and my car hit the side guard of the semi truck trailer and also the guard rail. I walked away without a scratch despite totaling my car. \n\nBut if that trailer hadn't had a side guard? I would've gone under it and been crushed to death. But sure. Just hit the semi truck. You won't be at-fault by insurance. Sure, you'll be dead. But not at-fault.", "Happy Cake Day!", "Bay Area here and yes it absolutely is a California roll lol. I've driven up and down the state and it's everywhere", "Same here. A lady almost backed into me and my baby the other day and if she\u2019d simply looked she wouldn\u2019t have scared the daylights out of us and nearly flattened us", "I was going over a 2 lane bridge when a semi decided to pass me and the car in front of me. It was a clear afternoon and you could clearly see oncoming traffic. This poor car in the other lane had to swerve and narrowly missed the guardrail. I called the \"how's my driving\" number to report the driver and, wouldn't you know, the company no longer kept track of problems with their drivers.", "It\u2019s more like one of those rolly things a mechanic uses. And a plastic lid he pretends is a steering wheel. Don\u2019t worry though, he has a helmet!", "Wtf is the \u201cshe opened her eyes\u201d comment? Like it\u2019s fine she\u2019s not dead just horribly injured, do they think they should get off Scott free if the person just doesn\u2019t die? Drivers piss me off", "That truck did its job and protected you! Glad you're okay.", "The highway is scary.  And this happened to you while learning!  Hell no.  I would have never gotten over it.", "Look I\u2019m more of a suggested stopper at stop signs, and even I know you\u2019re supposed to count to three\u2026I just don\u2019t.", "Dude, I had neck surgery 9 years ago and can barely turn my head. You better believe I triple check backing out. And so what if GF triple checks? it's not affecting you. YTA.", "Agreed!!!!", "My sister will just tap her brakes, look around then barrel onward. I tend to stop fully, wait til the car does that roll back thing, check no one is coming then go. She hates being a passenger for me as much as I hate being in the car she's driving.", "Most lights have a delay between one set turning red and another turning green. It's good to be alert and defensive, but traffic engineers do plan for people running red lights (well speeding through yellows and then running the red), especially in busy or metro areas.\n\nDon't wait at a green light. Be alert and observant, don't slam on the gas, but go forward when the light turns green unless there is clear danger if you don't yield right of way.", "Yes but your foot can hover over the brake pedal without actually braking. I dated someone who was always, always, always either accelerating by pressing the gas or decelerating by pressing the brake. JUST LET THE CAR COAST AHHHH.", "I always wait a few seconds. Had I not once, I would have been T-boned and killed by someone who blew a very red light a few years ago speeding extremely fast So yeah, since then, I'm going to wait a few seconds, especially because folks where I live run reds on the regular. I've spent way too long trying to get my depression under control to die in a fucking traffic accident.", "No bro you're supposed to look in the rearview mirror, ensure road is present, and floor it in reverse.", "I bet he screams at her while driving which makes her anxious. My ex did this when I asked him to teach me how to drive. I was so terrified of driving because he would terrorize me then tell me I'm a hazard. I failed the driving test after practicing with him for months. Later I got a professional driving instructor for 3 one hour sessions and I aced the driving test because I wasn't terrified at someone screaming in my ear the whole time", "If it was really only about insurance, then why did you say this:\n\n>I told her, I knew that would happen someday\n\nYou're backtracking now because people are saying you're wrong, lol", "OP, in describing her driving habits, has pretty much only told us that he's extremely impatient. All of his examples make me fairly certain that he's one of those people who gets seriously pissed off if you won't speed to make a yellow light that's 100 meters ahead of you.", "That would not even be possible with my car. Right foot is gas or brake, left is transmission (koppeling, am I translating correctly?). So if I keep a foot on the brake, I cannot drive \ud83d\ude05"]}
