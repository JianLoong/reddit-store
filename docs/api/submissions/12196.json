She lost control and hit the barrier. Luckily it was not too bad and the car is drive-able and fixable.\n\nWhen she explained what happened, I told her, I knew that would happen someday and she argued saying that it \"wasn't her fault\". I told her a single vehicle collision is always your fault and that if she had not over corrected, and slowed down gently she would not have lost control or even if she had hit the truck, then it would have been their fault.\n\nThe truck did not stop.\n\nEDIT: Seems like I am the AH, I will apologize. I really meant to say in terms of insurance. Obviously I know the truck initiated it by swerving.

You know what doesn't help anxious drivers? People telling them to stop being anxious drivers. I get anxiety just watching dashcam videos. And some truck drivers are menaces (tbf, some drivers of all vehicles are menaces, it's just more deadly with a semi). The fact the truck didn't stop after swerving shows that he/she was in the wrong. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with making sure or double sure or triple sure. You're just one of those 'Yellow means hurry to beat the red, not slow down-prepare to stop' types. Pausing at a stop sign is not a stop.

OP, YTA", "I understand why you would think overly cautious drivers are a hazard. I get frustrated sometimes when I\u2019m speeding and someone is riding the passing lane at speed limit, but I do understand that I\u2019m actually the hazard and would be at fault in a collision. Great drivers shouldn\u2019t mean skilled race car drivers. We need more drivers to be cautious, myself included.", "*Some* of what OP describes does seem like legit bad and dangerous driving. Pressing the brakes when she notices she is slightly over the speed limit for example can be dangerous or at the very least causes potentially bad situations for people behind them. Some of it is just somewhat annoying like waiting for several seconds at a stop sign. I know it would get to me if I was behind them and I had to wait when they have so much time to go.\n\nThe general tone of the post makes me lean on the side of him not accurately describing her driving. He just seems to be overly annoyed at her cautious driving and its not as bad as he describes.\n\nEdit: For those few people that downvoted, do you really not see a problem with people constantly hitting the brakes when they don't have to? Not even worrying about the people behind them. If you saw someone doing that ahead of you, would you think everything is cool or that the person isn't driving well and maybe give them a bigger cushion than normal?", "I can't trust gf's description of the accident anymore than I trust op's evaluation of her driving.

She reacted and avoided an accident with another driver. If she hadn't, then you'd say she's a bad driver bc of her reflexes.\n\nAnyway, the entire ordeal sounds so stressful.

I dunno about OP, but when I'm driving I am far more concerned about keeping myself *safe* than I am about any potential legal or insurance ramifications. \n\nIt's why I try to get away from tailgating drivers and why I am always scanning for my safest exit in case someone else swerves into my lane, etc. I don't care that where I live the person who hits you from behind is always at fault by default. I don't want to get hit in the first place. Getting hit from behind often causes whiplash and I don't want that.\n\nGetting sideswiped by a fuckin semi truck??

You're supposed to let off the gas to slow down and not use the brakes if you don't have to.\n\nSame with the stop sign.

HOWEVER, that \"overly cautious\" limit is pretty extreme, and not what OP is describing. \n\nFor instance, going 30 mph on a 80 mph stretch of highway for no obvious reason (so a full 50 mph UNDER the speed limit, and under what other cars are doing) is dangerous (saw this the other day, hence the example). Other cars are going to be assuming you are moving at roughly the same speed as traffic, so assuming you're +/- 10mph of the speed limit and will likely approach too quickly until they're close enough that they notice the speed difference and closing rate. That's why disabled or limited able cars (like in failsafe mode or on a mini spare, for example) are supposed to (at least where I live) use hazard lights. So they have a visual indicator of \"abnormal behavior happening with this car\". That helps give other drivers enough of a heads up that they have time to move or slow down or otherwise avoid the danger without having to do any sudden maneuvers. \n\nBraking to a full stop on a road to go over say, a small crack, can also be dangerous. Other cars may not be expecting you to stop suddenly. They *should* give enough room that they avoid hitting you anyway, but brake checking will still be the fault of the braking driver (sometimes partially split with following too closely for the hitting driver). \n\nA lesser but super annoying example is hazards in the rain. It doesn't help you be seen, and many hazards override turn signals, so now other cars don't know which direction or lane you are trying to move to. Just normal headlights and/or fog lights, and steady, controlled movements with proper signals is a lot safer. \n\nThat's the sort of unpredictable behavior that, while in theory is cautious, can actually be very dangerous. But what OP is describing is not even close to that.", "A lot of local roads are totally unsafe to walk where I am. It would be fine if you could trust the drivers, but you consistently cannot anymore.

But braking to stay under the speed limit, though excessive and potentially annoying to other drivers, is not the same thing. The braking driver is not only technically right, but they would not be found at fault in an accident where they braked and got rear-ended by someone tailgating them. Tailgating is far and away the worse offense, and the tailgating driver is liable in an accident. Not the braking driver.", "For me, you\u2019d be done. And she should find a bf who will actually give a shit. An apology would mean nothing at that point.", "Being un/predictable whilst driving is different to being cautious though.

Its not just about the person doing the braking. Unless say the road takes you downhill, you have no reason to brake over just letting off the gas. If a cop sees you brake all the time when you don't have to, they will also pull you over to see what's up.\n\nI just don't understand when people say that braking unnecessarily is not a problem because the person behind them should give them plenty of space to react. Even at a more personal level, you eat up your brakes significantly faster and you're supposed to be able to drive \"smoothly\" for the most part. If you can't, you shouldn't be on the road.", "I don't mean to pile on here, but if you meant that she was at fault in an insurance sense, and not in a real world sense, then why did you take such time to list out how she's a bad driver (for doing things that good drivers do)?

It meant you stopped for at least a few seconds before proceeding. Or else you were getting a ticket. OP is just hypercritical.", "I agree with you there, but you initially argued that what OP's girlfriend does is dangerous when it really isn't. Unnecessary? Probably. Annoying to other drivers? Possibly. But dangerous? No, not really.

Someone crosses the center line, I hold my lane and WANT them to hit me. I don't back down, no, I stand my ground.", "Its not dangerous like cutting people off or going 100mph in a 35. But it does increase at least a little. One mistake, even if minor, can have big consequences under certain circumstances and maybe not the driver behind you, but its possible that someone down the chain of braking you started is not paying attention or is caught off guard in the one moment they are distracted by something and they overreact to it that causes an accident when someone is tailgating them. That was my point. Its not safe or good driving even if its relatively minor. My whole point was that OP was overreacting to it as well because even if it is technically unsafe, his description reeks of exaggeration.", "Do you even like your girlfriend?

He narrowly missed four people and instead hit my sister.  She was extremely lucky to not have been killed.  \n\nOn the other hand, the police asked if he didn't realize he was turning into a crosswalk and his speed.  Again, the driver chose to argue with the police that because my sister opened her eyes after she was hit that she was \"fine\".
