If she wants jewelry,  that's on her husband tp provide it.  If he can't afford it, she'll have to accept that\n\n>. My brother says he will never speak to me again if I don\u2019t apologize but at this point, I\u2019m considering that the best Christmas gift of all.\n\nThis made me laugh out loud.  For your mom's sake, I hope you guys can patch things up, but you're still funny", "NTA, ask SIL what expensive gifts she bought others, and if she says none, then ask her why she hates your family.", "I was only married for 6 years, but my SIL and I never exchanged gifts.  My ex got something for his sister, and nothing for my brother, that was on me to get my brother a gift.\n\nWe both bought for our respective parents, not a large sum, but about the same.\n\nNTA, and if this is the hill your brother chooses to die on, means you are worth nothing to him unless you are spending money", "\n\nNTA. Not only did OP's brother & SIL assume she would be included in the jewellery exchange, but demanded specific jewellery (while inadvertently complaining about the bridal jewellery). \n\n>Things went from bad to worse when my brother stopped by to inspect the jewelry because his wife wanted something more colorful than pearls and she wanted red stone.", "There are red cubic zirconia. A red stone doesn\u2019t need to be a ruby. But really, unless asked you don\u2019t specify requirements for a gift.", "NTA. Here is to you and your sane family members having a joyful and peaceful holiday.", "So, her expects you to buy his wife expensive jewelry, and he gets your wife nothing? I'd love to ask my brothers to buy my wife expensive rings and necklaces. But they have too much common sense to waste money like that.\n\nNo blood relation, no need to buy jewelry. He can buy his wife rubies with his credit card. Your SIL is nuts. NTA", "NTA - I could not imagine being the SIL and expecting I would be getting jewelry like that. Also, who joins a family and feels entitled to such things? People never cease to amaze me.", "Wtf is wrong with people", "hahaha. I was thinking that not speaking to you was the best gift of all. It's up to her husband to buy her expensive jewelry. You don't buy that for your in-laws, you and your wife buy it for your immediate family (sister, mother). SIL is not in that category. Now bro needs to step up for his wife. NTA", "NTAYour SIL is sure entitled.  It's supposed to be her husband that buys her expensive jewelry, NOT her brother-in-law.\n\nThat said, I remember 30 years ago.  My sister-in-law's mother worked in a jewelry store.  She and my husband (my husband's brother) used the discount to buy his mother and his siter a piece of jewelry for Christmas.  I didn't get anything.  NOTE:  the jewelry wasn't that expensive.\n\nWhy was I hurt?  I was the one who always hosted people because we lived near the airport.  People would fly in, we would pick them up, provide a hospitality for the holidays, including all meals and booze, you name it.  My husband's sister never did anything.  I never said anything but I was really hurt.", "NTA - SHE can buy YOU expensive gifts . . .  WHAT is the matter with that woman? She sounds like a little girl . . . . having a temper tantrum and making demands. Don't give in to that kind of behavior because she'll expect more and more and more.", "Buy yourself something nice. You deserve it, others not so much.", "NTA. Perfect solution however- go to Kohls or Claire\u2019s and get costume jewelry.", "This is so childish.  You are all a bunch of grown adults.  Stop giving each other extravagant gifts, pair it down to something practical or do a secret Santa with monetary limits, or nothing at all, and let everyone buy their own jewelry for themselves if they can afford to do so.  If they can't, then too bad.  The main thing is everyone should be treated fairly - and no grown adult should expect expensive jewelry from anyone other than a spouse.", "NTA\n\nThe entitlement is strong with these ones.", "It's a mother's and sister tradition not SIL tradition. She is delusional and entitled,  your brother is in for an awful time because this woman is only after money. NTA", "NTA.\n\nWhat you give your mother and siblings do not need to be on par with what you gift your sil.\nYour brother has not been overly generous with your wife. You get nice jewelry for women who helped raise you. \n\nThey sound insanely entitled. Merry Christmas and Silent Night", "In the years that you have been married, what type of fine jewelry did your brother gift your wife?  Diamonds?  Emeralds?  Sapphires?  \n\nIf he has never gifted expensive jewelry to HIS sister in law, why is he expecting you to gift YOUR sister in law rubies and diamonds?  What woman expects, actually demands, pricey jewelry from a man that is not her husband?", "It's Jesus's birthday. You should have gotten them all bibles to commemorate his birth.", "OP, did your brother chip in for the history of gifts for mother's and sisters?  For his SIL?\n\nNTA, people shouldn't demand gifts.  Gifts are offered as the giver sees fit.", "Eww she sucks. Gold digger and materialistic. Don't give her anything, gross behavior", "NTA wow he isn't very intelligent your brother.  I'd say the garbage took itself out.  He can apologise for being entitled & weak regarding his wife.", "Weird. I thought it was the spouses jobs to buy each other expensive gifts..? Perhaps I\u2019ve been doing holidays and birthdays wrong my whole life. Also what about her own family?? Is there a reason they unable to buy her the expensive things that are seemingly so important to her?", "How did op humiliate or reject her?\n\nHe chipped in for an expensive  bridal set (that wasn't good enough for her) and still bought her a purse. The SIL is the one making this an issue by demanding jewlery and a specific type of jewlery at that. That's incredibly rude and if I were OP I wouldn't bother getting her anything at this point.\n\nWho in their right mind shows up to someone's house to inspect a Christmas gift. That's what set this all off in the first place, OP wasn't the one showing up on their door step.", "The attitude is from the SIL. Expecting expensive jewelry and then sending her husband to inspect if the jewelry is good enough seems like the \"attitude\" is on the SIL and not OP. OP is NTA", "Well then there you go get some pajamas hit michaels up and bejewel the heck out of them...just make sure they're red stones.", "Get them matching ruby red dildos", "Well said\n\nIf SIL wants to be a part of the tradition, she can start buying jewelry for HER mom and (if she has one) sister.", "While this sounds lovely, I don\u2019t think there is any need to say sorry. It is not OP\u2019s fault SIL had it in her mind the entitlement to receive jewelry at Christmas.", "Missed that.  What jewelery set did your brother buy your wife again?", "They\u2019d be a bitch to wash", "Ruby coloured pjs", "AND they will coordinate with each other", "Definitely a cultural thing. We don't do that either where I'm from.", "Birthstones were a big thing when I was growing up.  Being a March baby, I was always told it was red...a bloodstone.  I hated it.  As an adult, I went to a jewelry store in Ireland and was told it's aquamarine and it's beautiful.   Got a claddagh with a stone", "Can I request rubies instead?", "Spot-on :)", "Heya. Saying sorry doesn't mean accepting guilt or blame, at least not always.\n\nYou can say 'sorry for your loss' without being held on murder charges (extreme example, but you get the idea).\n\nSorry that your feelings are hurt, that you're sad, etc, is acknowledgement of a person's emotional state and offering sympathy. That's it. \n\nIt's also a way to have a conversation with someone who is upset - ignoring or dismissing their emotions will decrease the odds of them being open to listening to you.", "Brother cannot afford this wife. If the family gave her expensive bridal jewelry - and the husband didn\u2019t and never has\u2026 she sounds entitled beyond her & husbands means to expect the family to give her more?

Aquamarine is beautiful! Excuse my ignorance; what is a claddagh? I could look it up, but it's funner to find something out from another person ;)", "Get a red necklace from the dollar store", ">\nNotice she got in a knock at the bridal jewelry <<something more colorful than pearls>> So apparently, she didn't even like the bridal gift??/\n\nGood catch", "I laughed.  But sadly when I was in my 20s and working as a HHA, I had a lady patient wearing slick track suit pants slide out of her wheelchair.  I wasn't strong enough to lift her back up  and we had to call her grandson for help. Those pants were a hazard. She wasn't injured, by the way.", "A traditional ring in Ireland with 2 hands, a heart, and a crown.  The heart represents love, the crown represents loyalty, and the hands represent friendship", "He did say they wouldn't spend $5 on her.
