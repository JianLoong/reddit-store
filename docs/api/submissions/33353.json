Maybe there are cultural expectations that you're downplaying a bit (because she's now \"your sister too\"...?), but in general *no one should be making gift demands for Christmas.*\n\n**You should have taken a cue from your wife---who walked away from the discussion altogether.** Your SIL could have thrown her fit on Christmas Day, and she'd be the obvious asshole;  as it stands now, the rest of your family probably thinks you're as much to blame for the estrangement as your brother.", "This is brilliant- your wife should contact BIL and let him know that since she has been married to you for x years he can just combine the gifts he forgot to get her with this years gift and buy her a full diamond and sapphire set.", "NTA. Your brother doesn\u2019t get your wife fancy jewelry and she\u2019s been a part of the family longer. Your brother and his wife sound insane and entitled", "Yeah, OP can even return that expensive purse now...", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "MORE COLORFUL GEMS THIS TIME, BIL!", "They're clearly gonna do the whole entitled thing: \"You know we can't afford expensive gifts. You have more money than us so stop being greedy.\""]}
