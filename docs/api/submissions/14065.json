If she wasn't able to stay at home and had to work, there would be other advantages and disadvantages (like not having a husband holding this great stay at home privilege over your head) for both her and you. \n\nThe reason you are the AH is because of the way you used this view, in an argument, to put her down and to make it seem like she is oh SO lucky to be the primary parent to three children and therefore needs to do a better job at it.", "YTA because the problem here is that she's not picking up and drooping off the kids on time and she's sleeping through calls from the school when the kids are not picked up. She indicates that she's not coping and your translation of that is that she just doesn't appreciate how lucky she is.\n\nYou should be more concerned about what's going on at home that's overwhelming her.\n\nIs she sleeping during the day because she's depressed? Or because the kids wake her up at night and you don't wake up ever to care for them because she's the SAHM and it's her job? Is she staying up too late because she's so busy with the kids that she has to clean up at night?

Here is a list of some of the privileges afforded to you because your wife is a SAHM: \n- a live in nurse\n- a private chef \n- a housekeeper \n- a nanny \n- daily showers \n- solo bathroom breaks \n- coworkers who you can have adult conversations with \n- quiet time on your commute where you can listen to the music/podcast/audiobooks of your choosing or just sit in blessed silence \n- the fact that your coworkers respect your physical space and boundaries, instead of touching and climbing all over you\n- lunch time and breaks where you can sit and recharge \n\nAre you picking up what I\u2019m putting down? \n\nAll that said, the fact that your wife is missing pick up is concerning and you should be worried about why instead of berating her about how good she has it. *Is she burnt out? Is she depressed? Is she sick?* Time to have a conversation with your wife about how she\u2019s actually doing and what she needs from you. If this is your attitude I have a sneaking suspicion your wife has been carrying a very heavy load for a very long time and things are starting to fall apart. She needs your help, not your self righteous criticism.", "ESH. Even if you're right, you saying that implies that she should stop struggling or complaining.

You have valid concerns about her falling short with the kids, but what you essentially told her is \"wow, you already have it better than most and you are still messing it up.\" \n\nLet's be real.
