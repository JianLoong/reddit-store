Or because the kids wake her up at night and you don't wake up ever to care for them because she's the SAHM and it's her job?

Is she depressed? Is she sick?* Time to have a conversation with your wife about how she\u2019s actually doing and what she needs from you.

You have valid concerns about her falling short with the kids, but what you essentially told her is \"wow, you already have it better than most and you are still messing it up.\" \n\nLet's be real.

It is bothersome though that the school has to call you guys to because she forgot to pick up the kids.\n\nI wish i had the liberty to stay at home and care for my kids but then our family income won\u2019t be enough. You\u2019re right, it is a privilege i sadly wish i had even just until my kids are in their teens", "OP, if your wife was able to earn the income you did, would you be a SAHD? If you would be a SAHD then I think you have some basis to see your wife is privileged, if, however, there is no way you\u2019d be a SAHD then you cannot argue your wife is privileged as she\u2019s doing a job you wouldn\u2019t want to do. My wife and I both high earners in tech and both of us get a lot of fulfillment from our careers and although we could afford it, neither of us would want to be stay at home parents, so I wouldn\u2019t consider it a privilege.", "All three of your kids go to school M-F for what I\u2019m assuming is a regular school day - 6 hours, five times a week leaves her 30 hours each week to do what she wants. She doesn\u2019t have to work, she doesn\u2019t have to worry about bills, and she only has to do a full day with the kids on the weekends, so 8 days per month. I have been single-handedly responsible for toddlers for weeks and weeks and weeks with no help and no break. I would\u2019ve given ANYTHING for even a once weekly instance of 6 hours to myself. The fact that your wife is repeatedly sleeping through school pick/ups is unacceptable. I would kill to have a working husband while I stayed home with the kids.", "NTA. In today's economy, it absolutely is a privilege to be a stay-at-home parent. However, when you are getting CALLS (plural) that she is dropping the kids off late and is late picking them up, there's an issue. \n\nMy mom was a stay-at-home mom from the time I entered middle school (when she had my siblings) to 2 years after I graduated high school (when all my siblings were in school all day vs half a day). I rode the bus until I started driving unless my mom picked me up for an appointment. However, there was one incident that I remember. It had been raining for almost 2 weeks, I didn't take the bus because my mom was supposed to pick me. She didn't. I didn't think anything at first because she'd always wait until the pickup line at my high school went down to pick me up, but then I realized that there were no other cars or students around. The doors were locked and I couldn't get inside to call anyone. I had to walk a little over 7 miles with my violin and a bookbag that weighed 10 pounds on a road with no sidewalk, in about 3 inches of mud and rain to my aunt's house. By the time I made it to my aunt's it was close to 5, I got out of school at 3:30, so obviously I waited longer than I should've but still, my mom never showed. No one got a hold of my mom until after 6:30 because she was napping. Honestly, no one even knew she didn't pick me up until I got to my aunt's. \n\nAnything could've happened to me sitting outside the school alone for as long as I did or while I was walking to my aunts.

Never was late I was in the pickup line early. \n\nThe best part is if the children are in school that means they are old enough to help around the house.

Unless you want CPS involved.", "If she is not picking up the kids from school because she is napping, I would be concerned. No idea what is going on, but this is very irresponsible. I would suggest you tell her that she has to go to work and you will get a nanny as she is obviously bored or can't cope as a stay at home mom.

When you\u2019re a sahp and you have little babies and toddlers, you *are* on call 24/7. You do nighttime feedings. You take care of them during the day. You clean and cook on top of that. Being a sahp to school aged children is *still* hard. But you\u2019re no longer attached at the hip. You have some downtime. **Most of the time**, you\u2019re not waking up at night with them anymore. It\u2019s still hard, but it\u2019s not as hard. It\u2019s like a regular job.

I'm a mom in a similar situation (although I work from home and do the other stuff), and I haven't taken a nap in probably 10+ years, except for when I had newborns, and when I had the flu. Your wife should not be napping to the point where she isn't doing what she should. THAT needs to be addressed. I would tell her the next time she fails to pick the kids up on time, you're going to hire a nanny, and she can go back to work. Actually, ask her if she'd prefer that. Maybe that's what she needs. But also talk about what's going on. If you complain about work, she probably doesn't cut you off and tell you you're lucky to have a job. Is she depressed? Does she need to get her hormones, thyroid, or vitamin levels checked out?\n\nIf she's typically a good wife and mom, I'd look for a solution, not just remind her she's lucky to stay home.", "She needs to see a doctor if she constantly needs afternoon naps; if she's sick or not sleeping at night then those are issues a doctor may be able to help her with.

I developed a fear that I wouldn\u2019t get picked up at all, and during after school I never participated in any activities- I chose to stay in the main room and \u201cstudy\u201d because I irrationally thought that either it would make her on time or that maybe I\u2019d get left behind if I wasn\u2019t able to see the front door of the program when she came in. I never even studied, I just agonized because I was so scared a teacher would have to wait with me or that she\u2019d never come back.\n\nEdit: I should say, perception of staff and inconvenience to them as well.

Is she struggling with depression like many stay at home parents do? You say she occasionally is late or forgets the kids, how often does this happen? Weekly? Monthly? or is this the third time in the last year? \n\nA few other factors that could seriously adjust this answer are....    \nHow much do you contribute during your time at home outside of work? Specifically child care, housework, day to day tasks, etc.    \nDoes your wife have the ability to get out of the house and interact with other adults without the pressure of being on call because you can't watch the kids alone? Without the pressure of worrying if she wants to do something that costs money?   \nDoes your wife have to make a to do list in order for you to contribute to your home?   \nDo you two have a good relationship outside of this conversation?   \nWhen you two chose to have children, did your wife express interest in quitting her job to be a long term stay at home parent? Or was it just the \"easy\" and \"normal\" option?\n\nAs an important note, being a stay at home parent is in most cases only a privilege for the working spouse. You are allowed to go to work and make money. You are allowed to go to work and not worry about the inconveniences of kids being sent home for illness or anything else. You don't have to worry about catching up or paying cleaners to help keep up with things when you're exhausted from work and can't keep up. You don't have to worry about cooking, dishes, laundry, etc. In addition to that, stay at home parents (male or female) become a default parent who is in fact on call 24/7. In most cases it is severely detrimental to their mental health. A working parent gets to stay leave work, have alone time on their drive, and come home to a house where the majority of things have already been handled. It is a very different picture for a stay at home parent who is very often overworked, on call 24/7, has no personal time or time to decompress, and never gets a real break or the chance to take care of their basic human needs. Stay at home parents also usually lack any financial independence and have very little ability to control their life circumstances, and I've seen that path lead to resentment of their partner or even kids and horrible mental health many times.   \n\n\nThere's a lot to consider and this one sided post simply isn't enough to rule it out.

It was cheaper for me to stay home than pay for childcare in NYC.  Or barely break even once you factor in everything else. And even today I know families with a SAHP for the same reason.

Because, the truth is, your wife has a job. A difficult one. However, part of her job is getting the kids to and picking them up from school on time. Napping when she is meant to be doing either one of those is not acceptable.\n\nPerhaps next time, instead of telling her she is privileged to have a very difficult job, ask her why she is struggling to do her job and what might help.

Like I am super thankful that we were able to afford it, but I will never recover career-wise because of it. It was a privilege that the choice was there, but it was actually a huge personal sacrifice.\n\n> Phrasing it like the STAHP is the one who is privileged also implies that they are the only ones benefiting from the arrangement, completely ignoring the STAHP valid contributions.", "I mean, if you live in a house with multiple kids, it absolutely can take \"that long\", unless you're really strict on getting your kids to clean up after themselves. \n\nAgree with your judgement on the post, because you're right - kids should be getting picked up from school.
