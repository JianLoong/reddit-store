She has 5 younger half siblings. My grandpa past away when my grandma (GM) was pregnant with my mom.  After my mom was born my GM remarried; my mom stayed with her grandparents. My mom always felt abandoned/less special than her younger siblings, she wasn\u2019t treated the same. It hurts me knowing what my mom went through as a child. My mom married my dad and they moved to Europe; she always made sure they are financially OK and sent them nice presents.  \nFast forward to decades later: all siblings are now in their 60s. Everyone's wealthy either through their careers or marrying well. There\u2019s always drama. My mom tries to stay out of it;she feels if she messes up they might stop speaking to her. She just loves my GM so that\u2019s why she puts up with it.  \nMe: born & raised in Europe. Outside of summer vacations as a kid, I haven't spent much time with my relatives. We connected more when they got on social media which I\u2019ve enjoyed. I missed not having a large family around.  \nI've done well in school & I have a great career. My mom's super proud and she loves to brag about me. Years ago my uncle was going though stuff and needed money. My GM said: your daughter has money, she can give it to him. He needed 5k. I was barely out of university and into my entry level job. I had 5k on my bank account but I was saving up for my future. To me it's not appropriate to ask distant relatives for money. Another example: my aunt wanted me to send money to my cousin that\u2019s graduating. She needed 2k but they wouldn\u2019t say what for. They couldn\u2019t ask the dad who\u2019s a millionaire b/c she had already spent a lot. And the list goes on..  \nThe current request: my uncle asked me to sponsor his EU tourist visa (just for fun, nothing urgent). He said it'd be OK if I declined. I looked into the process; it turns out I\u2019d be financially + legally liable - my husband too. He won't be visiting us so we'd just have to trust him. I\u2019d also have to submit things like our bank statements, pay-slips which I'm not comfortable with. I value my privacy. I said NO and the family's very upset. My uncle shouted mean things about me, my family and even in-laws. 'I changed her diaper, she's forgotten everything I've done for her. I'm done with her' He mentioned taking us around the country even though my parents always paid. During my last visit I treated them all to a 5 star trip, all expenses paid. All I wanted was great memories for my mom & her siblings. My mom is my everything. They told my mom she needs to force me to do this. She thinks that\u2019s ridiculous, my GM's on our side. I'm seen as the good girl, the sweet one so I\u2019m sure me saying NO came as a shock. Note: my uncle has other options; he just wants me to do it.  \nToday I noticed that my 60+ yr old relatives have unfollowed me on IG which just blows my mind. This just adds to the narrative that they never truly loved my mom/European family.  \nTell me, AITA here?", "created_utc": 1692544593, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15we248/aita_for_refusing_to_sponsor_a_visa_for_my/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Follow your initial instinct. As for the other relatives, they are only relatives when convenient for them. Good luck.", "NTA. No to all of this.", "NTA. You're entitled to have boundaries. How flexible those boundaries are depends on the person in question and what they mean to you. That someone would go from asking to being abusive tells you where you fit in their universe. And at this point, why would you do something nice, something that involves personal risk, when you know how they really feel?", "NTA. I understand that, culturally, family is a bigger deal in some places than others. But your mom\u2019s family is entitled and awful. It sounds like you are both better off without them in your lives, even if it means \u201cturning your back\u201d on family. Only people who respect your boundaries deserve to be in your life. \n\nAnd you are absolutely correct about hesitating on the visa. I would never sponsor a visa for someone unless I was extraordinarily close to them and trusted them completely and they would be spending most of their time with me. Depending on which country he\u2019s from, there are most likely several other ways for him to get a visa.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
