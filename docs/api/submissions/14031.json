I have been collecting anime figurines for the past 10 years, the first figurine being a gift from my late older sister. I had a huge collection of over 90 figurines (Figmas, scale statues, Gunpla models, etc.) , which I kept in a display case in our bedroom. When my older sister passed away a few years back, I received her massive collection of figurines. For obvious reasons, the collection I had was very near and dear to me. My girlfriend (27F) has always known about my collection, and has never had a problem with it in the past.\n\nHowever, recently, she has started to become more and more critical of my collection. She says that it's \"taking up too much space in our room\", and that it's \"childish\". She also says that I'm spending too much money on expanding my collection. I tried to explain to her that my collection is important to me, and that I'm not going to get rid of it, but she just doesn't seem to understand. The majority of my collection was given to me after my sister's passing, as it was a hobby we both shared and bonded over.\n\nLast week I came home from work and I saw her moving a bunch of my figurines off the display case that I had set up and into a cardboard box. I asked her what she was doing and she said she was taking them up into the attic (For more context, my display case takes up a lot of room and we've been needing more space in our shared bedroom). I was reluctant, but eventually agreed to store the collection.\n\nThis past weekend I went up into the attic to grab one of my figurines (to show an online friend) and the entire box was missing. This, of course, started an intense argument with my girlfriend, in which she eventually admitted that she gave my collection away. When I pressed her on why she would do that, she said that I need to \"grow up\" as I'm almost 30 years old. She also said that she is tired of dating a \"man-child\" and thought that I would grow out of it eventually. Afterwards I told her I no longer wanted to be with her and that she needed to find another place to stay for the night.\n\nI don't have many hobbies but this is something extremely important to me. I feel like this hobby keeps a part of my sister alive. I'm really hurt by what she did. I still love her, and I thought she loved me too. But I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't accept the things I hold most dear.\n\nI've had time to cool down about our fight, and she's staying at her mother's house at the moment, but now I don't really know if I've made the right choice. I asked my father for advice and he told me that my sister wouldn't want her hobby to cause my relationship issues, but I\u2019m not sure if I should take her back unless I get a HUGE apology and my collection back. I want her to know that this is more than just a hobby for me.\n\nAITA for kicking out my girlfriend over anime figurines?", "created_utc": 1680679751, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cc4m9/aita_for_kicking_out_my_girlfriend_over_anime/", "score": 1487, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should respect your space and your possessions, especially for something you have clearly indicated you greatly value. If she can't do something this basic, I can only imagine the future conflicts you will have.

If she doesn't you could consider reporting her for theft.", "NTA She doesn't respect you or your stuff.", "NTA.  Those collections have a lot of monetary value and she just gave it away.  She\u2019s not your wife, she\u2019s a girlfriend.  It was in the attic.  Wtf? Sorry but she\u2019s a DBC.  Drop her like a dump in the toilet.", "NTA. She gave away your property, some of which you will NEVER regain because of it\u2019s sentimental value from your late sister. Your ex is disrespectful, selfish, and does not love you. Demand the figurines back or report them stolen.", "Your father's advice is unequivocally awful.\n\nBut hey, it's your life and your relationship, if you want to live it without any kind of boundaries then by all means do so.", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing to move part of your collection to another room and another thing to give your collection away. Who is she to make that decision about your collection? It\u2019s not hers. She doesn\u2019t respect you at all. I would never do that to any man. My ex had a huge collection of figurines he displayed. I didn\u2019t say one thing about them as I have my own collections. I\u2019m in my 50\u2019s and dated men who have different types of collections (comic books, figurines, toy cars etc.) and would not think to do what she did to you. There are many women who will respect your stuff so look for one like this.", "NTA. If you don't break up with her, she will break every boundary you have and hound you to an early grave. She demonstrated how little she cares about you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving to the attic was pretty pushy, but maybe it could pass. Giving them away without asking you first was abusive and theft. You didn't authorize her to do so, it's not communal marital property. You would be within your rights to sue her, although it's probably better to just break up and never talk to her again.", "Nta\nShe has no business taking your stuff down and putting it in the attic but surely you could move them and give yourselves enough space in your bedroom instead of adding more items to a collection for which there is already not enough space.    She can\u2019t expect you to get rid of it but she should expect to be able to use her own bedroom as a bedroom and not a storage space.\n\nEdit:changed vote after realising she threw the figures away. She\u2019s a rotten thief.", "NTA. Hey man... I'm a collector myself (though of mtg cards, tarot decks, and art prints). I might not be into anime figurines, but I have friends who are because I'm also into anime... and from my understanding of how much they cost from a number of friends (because I too am an anime fan) - those figurines can be EXTREMELY expensive. A collection the size you're talking about could easily be thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of dollars. While I wouldn't say 'no child could have these figurines', the reality is that those price points make these figurines much more accessible to adults who have the monetary means as well as more space. Do you have receipts or anything stored in a spreadsheet to keep up with how much money was spent on the collection itself? Anything that could demonstrate how just stealing the collection at this scale is, quite possibly, criminal activity because of how much it all cost? Like - you don't have to go there, dude, but the reality is that money is a real factor here that I think you haven't quite accounted for based on your post.\n\nAnd I don't think it's really about the figurines tbh. I mean, yes, it's about them, but think about it, dude. She's downplaying one of your major interests and showing a lot of disrespect to you over them rather than accepting that. It feels really shitty in my experience with people to be really excited about something and the person you care about the most to rain on your parade. What your GF did here is more than just raining on your parade. It's her saying 'I don't think you're ALLOWED to have your parade at all' and those are two very different statements.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like your GF wants someone who isn't you in at least some capacity and is trying to change you to fit her mold by force rather than being mature enough herself to buck up and realize that trying to forcibly change someone just doesn't usually turn out well.", "[removed]", "If you don't get an apology and your stuff back, why would you even want to be with her? She's already trying to change you & imply you're not good enough as you are. She showed you she doesn't even care for your feelings about your sister & your memories. Or your hobby. That's not love.", "NTA. Anime figurines are not a bad or annoying hobby. If she wanted them out of a bedroom, she could have talked to you about relocating the display to a different part of the shared space. Assuming that she knows about your late sister and still acts this way, she's being incredibly insensitive and downright mean. Packing them without consent because SHE wanted to, convincing you to keep them in the attic so that they were out of sight long enough for her to \"give them away\" is flat-out fucked up behavior. Plus those figurines are not cheap! That's a lot of money that you invested to feel good, that she literally probably just threw out.\n\nOP, she sounds like an insensitive, selfish, cruel person. I think you are right to leave her because of this. If she loved you, she would have respected your boundaries and treasures, not have been annoyed by them. \n\nI'm so sorry that you have lost something so important to you, especially since one was a gift from your sister. My mother vindictively threw out clothes and pictures of me and my late friend, and I know how betrayed you must feel and how hurtful it is to lose something you cannot get back. That really sucks.", "NTA and I hope you get the collection back. Not sure if I'd take her back tho.", "NTA: Those were your belongings and she knew they were a part of your life going into the relationship. You drew the line that you would not be giving up on your hobby and she chose to cross that line by throwing out your stuff. She clearly needs to grow up a bit and you deserve better OP", "NTA and that's a major red flag. She doesn't respect your hobbies and what has sentimental value for you. I say good riddance. \n\nNow the only thing you could have done better is the space thing. It looks like you have very limited space and it's not fair that you occupy so much. You should rotate your collection and display only what you have space to show. One day you will have a bigger place and perhaps a room just for your collection, but now it's too much.\n\nBut she had no right to give it away and I would report her if she doesn't tell you where they went.", "NTA. She's already admitted she can't stand the fact you collect figurines and she thought you'd grow out of it. If she intentionally went behind your back to not only move them out of sight just so she could get rid of them altogether you have to wonder if she really even cares for you and what extreme she would go to next to get her way about something you all disagree with. \n\nMy advice is take this time away to really reflect on what she brings to your relationship. Is it her way or the highway most times?", "NTA. What she did was abusive. She gave away something she clearly knew meant a lot for you. Do you really want to stay with someone who doesn\u2019t respect you and ruins your stuff? I\u2019m sure you can find a better person", "NTA But your girlfriend sure is a major asshole. Not only is she lacking in empathy about sentimental things given by your late sister that she should be respecting, but she gave away things you enjoy without your permission and is criticizing.\n\nNo one that truly cares does something like that.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t have lied to you about it. She\u2019s definitely TAH in this situation, not you.", "NTA. She got rid of your property and violated a huge boundary. Make sure she gets back the collection she stole from you to avoid you reporting the theft. And if someone would do that to me, the violation of boundaries, then I would never take them (the person) back into my life.", "Has nothing to do with figurines in the end and everything to do with trust and communication. This person just doesn\u2019t respect OP.", "[removed]", "Horrible take. Would you say the same thing if OP\u2019s partner got rid of some jewellery they inherited?", "Nothing about this is odd, get the fuck off your dumb high horse. I'm 32 and build models. I know other successful people well in their 50s who build models. Big ol display cases too. People who decide what thing are \"adult\" or not are usually the most childish people I've met. Super shallow. Seriously, what a gross mindset.", "Ew, your attitude is gross. You wouldn\u2019t shame someone for collecting plants or stamps. It\u2019s not \u201choarding\u201d. \n\nOP is free to spend his money as he pleases. It\u2019s enjoyable for him and reminds him of his late sister \n\nNTA OP", "People build model trains and planes well into their twilight years. The first person to make an AMV died *this year*. Hobbies don't have an expiry date.\n\nOP, NTA. I hope you can get some of your collection back.", "Just gonna point this out: this isn't odd for the age of what sounds like 28/29 to me. A lot of people in the current generation of that age grew up with anime, which in general has just become more mainstream and accepted as an interest, especially in younger generations. We are past the age of 'being into anime and video games is weird and you're a nerd if you like them' because the content itself has become 'in vogue', if you will.\n\nBut also - real talk, those anime figurines are EXPENSIVE... which means that they cannot possibly be only expecting to sell those to children and chances are high that they don't see children as their main selling demopgraphic. If you expect anime figurines to only be something purchased by children, who generally aren't going to have the means to have this hobby unless they happen to have really rich and accommodating parents, but then say that any adult interested in it is weird for buying them... it sounds like you just want to rain on someone's parade because it's not the thing you're interested in and would rather no one be into it at all.", "Nothing about this is odd.

Just storing in the attic would have been fine.", "That\u2019s secondary to the gold, baby.", "Oh crap I missed that bit, that\u2019s just straight up theft and unforgivable. \nShe needed to pull on her big girl panties and talk to OP about how she felt. The moment hands were on the figurines she fucked up irreparably.", "NTA. I would also be calling the police and charging her with theft unless she got the collection back within a week.\n\nI'm absolutely done with the whole idea of men AND women being told we can't carry on our hobbies and interests for the sake of this mythical beast called \"adulthood\". She took something important to you, that wasn't doing her any harm, and got rid of it because she's jealous, and petty, and doesn't respect you in the least.", "NTA  Your girlfriend is an awful person.", "NTA\n\nPersonally, I'd be done. She didn't respect your hobby, belongings and opinion, why would you stay with her? Why was she so upset about figurines in a box in the attic that she gave them away without discussing it?\n\nIt would have been ok to bring up giving them away or selling them if you haven't looked at them for a while, but getting rid of them without talking to younor even telling you is an AH move.\n\nPetty me would probably tell her she gets another chance if she can get them back or at least reemburse the cost and dump her afterwards. \n\nIf you decide to dump her, make it absolutely clear that this is not about the figurines, it is about respect and communiaction.", "NTA\n\nShe knew that you love the collection and decided to get rid of it because?\n\nThe problem with your girlfriend is not \"anime figurines\", but the fact that she does not respect your hobby, does not care about your feelings.", "NTA\n\nEnd it. Complete betrayal and an absolute deal breaker. \n\nAlso why do you think she will be able to get the collection back? She claims to have given them away, sure she didn't sell them and kept the money? Someone awful enough to have done what she did definitely would pull something like that.", "You absolutely did the right thing, and you should consider pressing charges against your now ex-girlfriend.  This collection sounds like it may be worth thousands of dollars, so it may even qualify as a felony - SERIOUS charges!  If she did not understand the importance of the collection to you, especially those items from your **LATE SISTER**, then your ex never really understood you at all.\n\nMake her get your collection back, at HER expense.  Once it's back in your display case where it belongs, then break off all contact and block her on all avenues of communication.\n\nMy only criticism of you, OP, is for not establishing and defending your boundary about your collection in the first place.  Let this be a lesson to you.\n\n* On a tangential note, this sounds like a scene from the movie \"The Forty Year Old Virgin\", in which the main character himself had quite the collection of comic book and other pop culture collectibles.", "NTA. DO NOT GET BACK TOGETHER. Its obvious that you two aren't compatible. Instead of realizing that you're incompatible and moving on, she decided to lie to you, manipulate you, and destroy something of enormous sentimental value that regularly brings you joy..... because she didn't like them and ot didn't fit her idea of the ideal man.\n\nEvery choice she made in this process, large and small, was obviously the wrong choice. She doesn't want you, she wants \"anyone close enough\" that she can just emotionally and functionally manipulate into being who she really wants, regardless of whether or not you resemble that person at all.\n\nRun.

No. But, he would never, and I mean never touch them w/o permission. \n\nWe had a huge scare a few years back. Like, we might lose all savings, retirement, house type scare. I immediately pulled out some of my rare figures and started pricing them. Did I want to? No, but life happens.

(he's amazing, sometimes irritating, but amazing, lol)\n\nWe ended up being worried for nothing, but I can't tell you how much I appreciated his attitude. \n\nTo have someone tell you to grow up while not appreciating how special this collection is to you, she is out of line.

And space nowadays is *expensive*. Minimalism is the way to keep your mind clear and to detach yourself for material possessions. They don't have value by themselves - it's your feelings towards them that make them valuable. If you kept just one thing from your sister it would serve as much of a reminder as a whole collection.\n\nI dated a collector. In the beginning of the relationship I didn't anticipate it will bring as many issues as it did. He kept expanding his collection, I was living in his apartment, paying him rent (if you ask me, I paid for a lot more space than I actually had) and he never seemed to stop with buying new things. This caused resentment because I was indirectly giving him enough money to buy those - and the more he bought, the less space I had. I still had to keep my apartment to store my things - so I was paying my mortgage and half of his as rent. I kept suggesting that we'd buy a bigger space together but nope, not ready, never ready. It was a terrible arrangement for me.\n\nIt's your absolute right to have and keep expanding your collection, but the more mature adults you date, the more of a dealbreaker insufficient space will be.

She should not have given them away without discussing it with you, period. \n\nNow throw in they are sentimental items reminding you of your deceased sister, and what she did was horrible.

He said that he\u2019d maybe take her back if she had a big apology and got all the figurines back and understood that this is hobby and important to him. \n\nSo that\u2019s what she\u2019s on about.", "Did you read to the end of the post?", "As someone who collected anime stuff in the past; not having them in the bedroom was a fair ask. Boxing them up is a bit extreme, and given them away was just plain out of line. \n\nIt\u2019s really no different that someone not wanting to sleep in a hello kitty room, or in a race car bed. But the problem isn\u2019t not wanting that, the problem is trying to force the decision on others, and stealing their property to get their way.", "She's abusive. She was jealous of him caring about anything but her and it made her feel powerful to do something cruel.\n\nIt's extremely common to see posts here on a situation that can only be explained by intentional cruelty or an unbelievable lack of understanding that's really only logical in the case of a brain injury or something. When you love someone, they've never done something that hurtful, and they lie to your face with such ease & insistence it's really, really hard to wrap your mind around the fact that they are not who they've pretended to be - sometimes for years. If someone does something any sane person would know is hurtful, they *knew it would be hurtful* no matter what they say. Listen to your gut, ignore their lies, and run.", "My friend buys these figurine statues from BNHA, and every single one of them has been between $100 and $250", "right, space was never the fundamental issue. she didn't ever have a problem with it before (maybe she did and it didn't register on his radar?), until just recently (whatever that means). and then it goes from so much space to none at all, just boxed up and out of sight. it doesn't sound like she was trying to find a mutually agreeable solution. and from what she ended up doing with the figurines and then saying to him, however those conversations about space might have gone previously, she clearly had a hidden agenda she was trying to impose.", "It's clearly not a hobby.\n\nI would bet his betrayal cut far worse than hers.", "Missed all the points which I'm guessing will be a reoccurring theme with my post. \n\nI said \"to all those\" - in other words the people responding, not the OP himself.\n\nThese are not momentos, this is an obsession that has descended into emotional reliance. I have far more sympathy for his unloved and ignored partner than for his collection.\n\nIf you were old enough and mature enough to know, you would understand how rare it is for 2 people to meet that are so compatible that they can just be their natural selves with no fuss or complications. You have to work at a loving, lifetime relationship. You have to sacrifice and make concessions, go out of your way to do things that you know will have a big impact on your partner but not necessarily yourself. Be caring, empathetic and understanding of the fact you are not perfect and that this relationship will be the vehicle by which you grow and evolve as a person. You do not get to be a self-indulgent and obsessive and get all the perks of a relationship while ignoring your responsibilities.\n\nShe threw out some of his stuff but I bet he threw her out long before that. Her actions speak to me as the last attempt of a desperate person to get his attention and help him change and move on. Yet all reddit's AH network can offer is \"get rid man, she doesn't respect your stuff man, HUGE red flag man, call the police dude, figurines for life bro....\" \nWell done.", "You have to make assumptions when you only have 3 paragraphs to go on.\n\nHe is obsessive and his obsession is to the detriment of his relationship. If you call that passion then whatever.\n\nI'm no arbiter, just giving my opinion on the matter which is literally the point of this sub unless I've misunderstood. And yes, not a popular opinion but I don't post to be popular. My inference to this post is that he's caused her far more harm over the course of their relationship than she has with her horrible act and if he wants to really understand what happened he will need to take a long hard look at himself.\n\nNot just \"get rid\" which seems to be all the advice this sub can offer on whatever the topic is", "Or she just tossed them in a dumpster.", "She stole mementos of his dead sister and lied about what she did with it, because he didn't live up to her image of what a \"man\" should be.", "100%. I have several bookshelves and one of them is dedicated to \"sillier\" things like action figures, printed standees (they're like plastic or plexiglass with art printed on them, as opposed to actual 3D figures), any kind of ceramic models I've painted at little craft stores, and even a few stuffed animals. Is it childish? I guess you could say that. But I don't care at all.\n\nThe things that people enjoy (that aren't hurting anyone else) shouldn't be embarrassing, and your partner shouldn't mock you for them. I feel bad for OP, especially with the added sentimental value of much of the collection being from the late sister...", "I need to \"grow up\" as I'm almost 30 years old.", "I am just replying to the hobbies vs adulting vs space part, not doing a judgement on the post.", "The GF is TA no question. If you want, you can check my comment with judgement. Of course throwing out somebody's belongings is an asshole territory, doesn't even need to be asked.\n\nI just replied to the \"adulting\" part that considering one's space is something that a developed adult should do.", "In this case, it actually comes before the gold; she could give OP a million dollars, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to regain the figures his dead sister gave him. He might be able to get the same models, but he can\u2019t get the sentiment back. The sentimental value shits all over the monetary value given the context.", "When exactly did he betray her? By telling her that he can't be with her unless she is willing to apologise and return his collection? \n\nAgain, this was him being upfront about what he wants out of the relationship. I'm willing to concede that him casting her out after her theft and betrayal was hurtful for the girlfriend, but then again, it may have been justified. \n\nIt's justified to cut someone off when they threaten your very sense of identity. I'd say it's a measure of self-defense on his part when he threw her out after he found out about the depths of her utter disregard for him and a part of him that he cares about deeply.", "Then gf could have left the relationship if her needs were not being met. It was absolutely not her place or right to decide if something had value to him. And if his needs were being met, he might have decided to give up or sell his collection eventually. The fact that she stole his momentos from him indicates a selfish and self centered personality and he's well rid of her.", "If she was so harmed about his collection (that you continue to refer to as obsession with no supporting proof beyond your skewed worldview) then why did she continue the relationship? If it was so harmful surely she can do better right?\n\nNo she felt she could force a change in his passions by removing it. If he enjoyed carpentry as a hobby (which takes up a lot of space as well) and his partner just took all his tools and materials and gave them away, would you still feel the same? Or is it because they are static items commonly associated with children you feel it's perfectly fine to just get rid of them?", "No you are miserable for sure", "He takes up all the space, spends excessive money, and barely tolerated moving one box, he is not a good partner.", "I'm assuming that her act was the act of a desperate individual trying to get through to their partner after multiple failed attempts. It's very unlikely this came out of the blue and he does explain their conversations around space and money so I'm assuming this is a long-running issue.\n\nI make it clear, assumptions. You cannot get the full picture from 4 paragraphs and I feel it's incredibly irresponsible for people to immediately advocate for their separation based on this post. He is clearly overly obsessed with these figurines and he's losing people who live and care for him. People equate this to their love of a video game or whatever but it's not the same at all. These figurines act as his own little world, where he feels his pain but equally feels safe from it's consequences, where his obsession is now his crutch and his \"therapy\". Except it's not therapy, it's the opposite and it's costing him love in the real world.\n\nI bet he told her all the things she wanted to hear, whispered those sweet nothings when he wanted what he wants but in reality his life is work and figurines and nothing in between.\n\nIt's why I asked a simple question, do you discuss the future, your hopes and dreams together, do you socialise together? I bet you the answer is no and that's how he betrayed her. In my humble opinion tossing someone's figurines pales in comparison to their time, emotion and love that you wasted and ignored.", "Ok sure. In your binary black and white world she stole and has suffered the consequences. I didn't realise this the \"are they the criminal\" sub but you guys have all become experts on personal property law it seems.\n\nI understand your culture is entirely based around one's self-esteem and self-worth being derived from one's possessions but I'm guessing he has been far meaner and dismissive of her than the act of stealing his figurines.\n\nThey are not momentos, if the people responding to the OP understood that small but not insignificant detail he might get some actual advice.\n\nInstead you guys are like \" Heard it, easy one this one, she stole your stuff and doesn't respect you, get rid!\" without even bothering to understand and try to discern why a person acts the way they do which I thought was kind of the point of this sub in the first place.", "Look, you have to make assumptions unless the OP is willing to edit which this one doesn't seem interested in.\n\nMaybe you're right, maybe all of you are right and this man is onto a winner with his behaviour. Takes all sorts right?\n\nI think her behaviour screamed desperation. The act of someone who has tried many times to break through and has eventually lost their patience and lashed out. \n\nAlso give it a rest with the skewed world view. Having a go at someone for making assumptions and then doing so by making assumptions just makes you a hypocrite.", "No, not at all? They seem pretty reasonable, the miserable people are clearly the ones defending the most childish and cringe behavior possible.", "The only miserable person here is the OP, which he will discover soon enough.", "To which the appropriate response is to *leave him*, not steal from him.", "Yeahhhh you\u2019re convincing everyone", "Yeah, you're right about that, she should just leave him and she shouldn't have thrown the box out. Her needs are not respected by him, so she should get out.", "Of course it matters if you are communicating with your SO and work together on solutions or if you are ignoring them until they do something- that is wrong in the first place- and than 'allowing' that to be okay o.o\n\n\nSimply moving his stuff was already not great"]}
