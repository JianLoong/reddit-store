{"id": 14031, "submission_id": "12cc4m9", "title": "AITA for kicking out my girlfriend over anime figurines?", "selftext": "I (29M) am a HUGE anime fan. I have been collecting anime figurines for the past 10 years, the first figurine being a gift from my late older sister. I had a huge collection of over 90 figurines (Figmas, scale statues, Gunpla models, etc.) , which I kept in a display case in our bedroom. When my older sister passed away a few years back, I received her massive collection of figurines. For obvious reasons, the collection I had was very near and dear to me. My girlfriend (27F) has always known about my collection, and has never had a problem with it in the past.\n\nHowever, recently, she has started to become more and more critical of my collection. She says that it's \"taking up too much space in our room\", and that it's \"childish\". She also says that I'm spending too much money on expanding my collection. I tried to explain to her that my collection is important to me, and that I'm not going to get rid of it, but she just doesn't seem to understand. The majority of my collection was given to me after my sister's passing, as it was a hobby we both shared and bonded over.\n\nLast week I came home from work and I saw her moving a bunch of my figurines off the display case that I had set up and into a cardboard box. I asked her what she was doing and she said she was taking them up into the attic (For more context, my display case takes up a lot of room and we've been needing more space in our shared bedroom). I was reluctant, but eventually agreed to store the collection.\n\nThis past weekend I went up into the attic to grab one of my figurines (to show an online friend) and the entire box was missing. This, of course, started an intense argument with my girlfriend, in which she eventually admitted that she gave my collection away. When I pressed her on why she would do that, she said that I need to \"grow up\" as I'm almost 30 years old. She also said that she is tired of dating a \"man-child\" and thought that I would grow out of it eventually. Afterwards I told her I no longer wanted to be with her and that she needed to find another place to stay for the night.\n\nI don't have many hobbies but this is something extremely important to me. I feel like this hobby keeps a part of my sister alive. I'm really hurt by what she did. I still love her, and I thought she loved me too. But I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't accept the things I hold most dear.\n\nI've had time to cool down about our fight, and she's staying at her mother's house at the moment, but now I don't really know if I've made the right choice. I asked my father for advice and he told me that my sister wouldn't want her hobby to cause my relationship issues, but I\u2019m not sure if I should take her back unless I get a HUGE apology and my collection back. I want her to know that this is more than just a hobby for me.\n\nAITA for kicking out my girlfriend over anime figurines?", "created_utc": 1680679751, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cc4m9/aita_for_kicking_out_my_girlfriend_over_anime/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should respect your space and your possessions, especially for something you have clearly indicated you greatly value. If she can't do something this basic, I can only imagine the future conflicts you will have. If she does not give a sincere apology, think about breaking up.\n\nAlso get her to get your stuff back, because she basically stole your stuff. If she doesn't you could consider reporting her for theft.", "NTA She doesn't respect you or your stuff.", "NTA.  Those collections have a lot of monetary value and she just gave it away.  She\u2019s not your wife, she\u2019s a girlfriend.  It was in the attic.  Wtf? Sorry but she\u2019s a DBC.  Drop her like a dump in the toilet.", "NTA. She gave away your property, some of which you will NEVER regain because of it\u2019s sentimental value from your late sister. Your ex is disrespectful, selfish, and does not love you. Demand the figurines back or report them stolen.", "Your father's advice is unequivocally awful.\n\nBut hey, it's your life and your relationship, if you want to live it without any kind of boundaries then by all means do so.", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing to move part of your collection to another room and another thing to give your collection away. Who is she to make that decision about your collection? It\u2019s not hers. She doesn\u2019t respect you at all. I would never do that to any man. My ex had a huge collection of figurines he displayed. I didn\u2019t say one thing about them as I have my own collections. I\u2019m in my 50\u2019s and dated men who have different types of collections (comic books, figurines, toy cars etc.) and would not think to do what she did to you. There are many women who will respect your stuff so look for one like this.", "NTA. If you don't break up with her, she will break every boundary you have and hound you to an early grave. She demonstrated how little she cares about you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving to the attic was pretty pushy, but maybe it could pass. Giving them away without asking you first was abusive and theft. You didn't authorize her to do so, it's not communal marital property. You would be within your rights to sue her, although it's probably better to just break up and never talk to her again.", "Nta\nShe has no business taking your stuff down and putting it in the attic but surely you could move them and give yourselves enough space in your bedroom instead of adding more items to a collection for which there is already not enough space.    She can\u2019t expect you to get rid of it but she should expect to be able to use her own bedroom as a bedroom and not a storage space.\n\nEdit:changed vote after realising she threw the figures away. She\u2019s a rotten thief.", "NTA. Hey man... I'm a collector myself (though of mtg cards, tarot decks, and art prints). I might not be into anime figurines, but I have friends who are because I'm also into anime... and from my understanding of how much they cost from a number of friends (because I too am an anime fan) - those figurines can be EXTREMELY expensive. A collection the size you're talking about could easily be thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of dollars. While I wouldn't say 'no child could have these figurines', the reality is that those price points make these figurines much more accessible to adults who have the monetary means as well as more space. Do you have receipts or anything stored in a spreadsheet to keep up with how much money was spent on the collection itself? Anything that could demonstrate how just stealing the collection at this scale is, quite possibly, criminal activity because of how much it all cost? Like - you don't have to go there, dude, but the reality is that money is a real factor here that I think you haven't quite accounted for based on your post.\n\nAnd I don't think it's really about the figurines tbh. I mean, yes, it's about them, but think about it, dude. She's downplaying one of your major interests and showing a lot of disrespect to you over them rather than accepting that. It feels really shitty in my experience with people to be really excited about something and the person you care about the most to rain on your parade. What your GF did here is more than just raining on your parade. It's her saying 'I don't think you're ALLOWED to have your parade at all' and those are two very different statements.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like your GF wants someone who isn't you in at least some capacity and is trying to change you to fit her mold by force rather than being mature enough herself to buck up and realize that trying to forcibly change someone just doesn't usually turn out well.", "NTA just an incel in the making", "If you don't get an apology and your stuff back, why would you even want to be with her? She's already trying to change you & imply you're not good enough as you are. She showed you she doesn't even care for your feelings about your sister & your memories. Or your hobby. That's not love.", "NTA. Anime figurines are not a bad or annoying hobby. If she wanted them out of a bedroom, she could have talked to you about relocating the display to a different part of the shared space. Assuming that she knows about your late sister and still acts this way, she's being incredibly insensitive and downright mean. Packing them without consent because SHE wanted to, convincing you to keep them in the attic so that they were out of sight long enough for her to \"give them away\" is flat-out fucked up behavior. Plus those figurines are not cheap! That's a lot of money that you invested to feel good, that she literally probably just threw out.\n\nOP, she sounds like an insensitive, selfish, cruel person. I think you are right to leave her because of this. If she loved you, she would have respected your boundaries and treasures, not have been annoyed by them. \n\nI'm so sorry that you have lost something so important to you, especially since one was a gift from your sister. My mother vindictively threw out clothes and pictures of me and my late friend, and I know how betrayed you must feel and how hurtful it is to lose something you cannot get back. That really sucks.", "NTA and I hope you get the collection back. Not sure if I'd take her back tho.", "NTA: Those were your belongings and she knew they were a part of your life going into the relationship. You drew the line that you would not be giving up on your hobby and she chose to cross that line by throwing out your stuff. She clearly needs to grow up a bit and you deserve better OP", "NTA and that's a major red flag. She doesn't respect your hobbies and what has sentimental value for you. I say good riddance. \n\nNow the only thing you could have done better is the space thing. It looks like you have very limited space and it's not fair that you occupy so much. You should rotate your collection and display only what you have space to show. One day you will have a bigger place and perhaps a room just for your collection, but now it's too much.\n\nBut she had no right to give it away and I would report her if she doesn't tell you where they went.", "NTA. She's already admitted she can't stand the fact you collect figurines and she thought you'd grow out of it. If she intentionally went behind your back to not only move them out of sight just so she could get rid of them altogether you have to wonder if she really even cares for you and what extreme she would go to next to get her way about something you all disagree with. \n\nMy advice is take this time away to really reflect on what she brings to your relationship. Is it her way or the highway most times?", "NTA. What she did was abusive. She gave away something she clearly knew meant a lot for you. Do you really want to stay with someone who doesn\u2019t respect you and ruins your stuff? I\u2019m sure you can find a better person", "NTA But your girlfriend sure is a major asshole. Not only is she lacking in empathy about sentimental things given by your late sister that she should be respecting, but she gave away things you enjoy without your permission and is criticizing.\n\nNo one that truly cares does something like that.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t have lied to you about it. She\u2019s definitely TAH in this situation, not you.", "NTA. She got rid of your property and violated a huge boundary. Make sure she gets back the collection she stole from you to avoid you reporting the theft. And if someone would do that to me, the violation of boundaries, then I would never take them (the person) back into my life.", "Has nothing to do with figurines in the end and everything to do with trust and communication. This person just doesn\u2019t respect OP.", "[removed]", "Horrible take. Would you say the same thing if OP\u2019s partner got rid of some jewellery they inherited?", "Nothing about this is odd, get the fuck off your dumb high horse. I'm 32 and build models. I know other successful people well in their 50s who build models. Big ol display cases too. People who decide what thing are \"adult\" or not are usually the most childish people I've met. Super shallow. Seriously, what a gross mindset.", "Ew, your attitude is gross. You wouldn\u2019t shame someone for collecting plants or stamps. It\u2019s not \u201choarding\u201d. \n\nOP is free to spend his money as he pleases. It\u2019s enjoyable for him and reminds him of his late sister \n\nNTA OP", "People build model trains and planes well into their twilight years. The first person to make an AMV died *this year*. Hobbies don't have an expiry date.\n\nOP, NTA. I hope you can get some of your collection back.", "Just gonna point this out: this isn't odd for the age of what sounds like 28/29 to me. A lot of people in the current generation of that age grew up with anime, which in general has just become more mainstream and accepted as an interest, especially in younger generations. We are past the age of 'being into anime and video games is weird and you're a nerd if you like them' because the content itself has become 'in vogue', if you will.\n\nBut also - real talk, those anime figurines are EXPENSIVE... which means that they cannot possibly be only expecting to sell those to children and chances are high that they don't see children as their main selling demopgraphic. If you expect anime figurines to only be something purchased by children, who generally aren't going to have the means to have this hobby unless they happen to have really rich and accommodating parents, but then say that any adult interested in it is weird for buying them... it sounds like you just want to rain on someone's parade because it's not the thing you're interested in and would rather no one be into it at all.", "Nothing about this is odd. Stop shaming people for their hobbies, life is already hard enough so let people have their fun as long as they don't hurt anyone.", "And his sisters stuff", ">lot of monetary value\n\nAnd sentimental", "She straight up gave away his stuff though. That\u2019s way worse than what he did. Just storing in the attic would have been fine.", "That\u2019s secondary to the gold, baby.", "Oh crap I missed that bit, that\u2019s just straight up theft and unforgivable. \nShe needed to pull on her big girl panties and talk to OP about how she felt. The moment hands were on the figurines she fucked up irreparably."]}
