Simplify and really think about it - you don\u2019t ask friends if they want to join you for dinner out if you don\u2019t have money to pay for your share of the bill.\n\nAgain, you made this problem by taking a stance that you should get exactly what the in laws get without giving anything - you want a vacation with them, pay for it. Or accept the weekend getaway he can afford to pay for himself.", "I hope your principles are worth losing your son over. Your DIL's family sounds a lot more emotionally healthy than you and your wife. You've also set yourselves up for failure.", "I guess my wife (and me to a lesser degree) are just hurt that they've never suggested vacationing with us, and are trying to make it happen.\n\nThey haven't suggested vacationing with you BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT", "Then she's not that devastated. \ud83d\ude44", "And please still give the grandkids prezzies.....", "There are many things that I *want* to do; there are few that I can *afford* to do.", "you make no sense. if you want him to come so badly, just pay for him.", "if you actually wanted him to come that badly you would pay.

We often did joint Christmases, vacations and the like. The key is being good friends to the inlaws, not competive assholes.", "Because it is", "I guess I expected more people to think that adults aren't entitled to vacations paid for by others.", "I think she just has it in her head that if they cared enough, they would have been saving already.  However, I did point out that we hadn't actually invited them anywhere, so that expectation isn't really fair.", "OK, that's a fair point.", "I guess I feel stuck between him and my wife.  I honestly don't want to rock any boats on either side.", "That doesn\u2019t seem to describe the dynamic here.", "You are being deliberately obtuse.\n\nYour son and his family go on these vacations because they\u2019re paid for. They cannot afford vacations otherwise, and his in-laws consider covering the cost of the adults worthwhile to enjoy family time.\n\nYour son declined *going into debt to pay for a vacation with you.* That is **not** treating you and your whiny wife like second-class citizens (though you\u2019re acting like it); it\u2019s making smart and caring decisions for his family\u2019s financial welfare. Your son offered you a compromise: push the cruise out or plan an affordable weekend away. You declined and tantrumed.\n\nQuit pouting about the other set of parents, respect your son\u2019s boundaries (financial and otherwise), and go make some memories with these people! If you love them it\u2019s not where you go or how much time is spent; it\u2019s what\u2019s made of the time spent together. You might enjoy yourselves if you step out of this pathetic lil grudge match you have with the other set of parents.", "You are just jealous that he goes with his wife\u2019s family and they all have a pleasant time. If the wife\u2019s family felt he/wife acted \u201centitled,\u201d they likely wouldn\u2019t fund the vacation. Since they are, then presumably it\u2019s their pleasure / delight to pay.   In general, it\u2019s not uncommon for well-to-do parents to fund family vacations for grown adult children/spouses, and it doesn\u2019t make the children necessarily \u201centitled.\u201d", "I would agree if they were the ones asking you to go on vacation and then insisting you pay. But they didn\u2019t. They were fine only paying for what they could afford. It\u2019s you who want them to spend money they don\u2019t have. I\u2019m not going to call your son an asshoel for saying \u201cThanks for the invite, but I can\u2019t afford it.\u201d In fact, a decent parent should be proud that their kid is smart and responsible enough to say that.", "nowhere in your post does he act entitled. you and your wife sound selfish wanting him to go into debt though.", "Your son didn\u2019t ask his in laws to pay for his vacation, they OFFERED. He\u2019s not acting entitled, you are.", "They aren\u2019t entitled.

You invited THEM.   The wife\u2019s parents pay for them.   You\u2019re making a huge issue for nothing.   We could all for tomorrow.   You never know.  LIVE YOUR LIFE and make as many memories as possible while you can.   You don\u2019t know how lucky you truly are", "And everyone is saying, you don't have to pay. But you can't get mad that someone won't charge up a credit card to make you feel valued. If you think vacationing together is a measure of how your son feels about you, then there are some deeper issues to address.", "Your son and his family aren\u2019t ASKING you to pay for a vacation. YOU are insisting that they vacation with you and your wife. The only entitled people in this story are you and your wife. You can\u2019t force your son to go into debt because your wife is jealous, entitled, and a cheapskate.", "Of course your won isn\u2019t entitled to a free vacation.  But he cannot afford one. It is what it is.  You and your wife are assholes for taking it personal that your son cannot afford a cruise.  Furthermore you can do something a lot cheaper than a cruise.  My sisters and I take trips to the beach with our father since our mother died.  We get a condo on the beach.  Split 4 ways and eating all our meals there makes it very affordable for all of us.", "WTF, I take my adult kids on Vaca as much as I can, the memories are amazing!! You'll never get great memories, because of your misguided principles.", "They aren\u2019t. And you\u2019re not entitled to having others pay to go on vacation with you.", "They aren't ENTITLED to a paid vacation, but if they can't afford one and you want them to go then you can pay, help pay, or wait another year or two.", "Jesus Head-Desking Christ, this is ridiculous. Your son isn't coming to you, out of the blue, asking you to pay for a vacation. YOU AND YOUR WIFE are asking him to go on a vacation that he has told you he can't afford! If your choosing beggar wife wants the vacation so much, then you pay for it. You don't ask your son to go into debt for the vacation that YOU want. How is this difficult? Is this some bullshit test by your wife? Prove that you love me, by not only going on vacation with me, but by going into debt to do it. Totally toxic. YTA", "Your wife is being both stubborn and ridiculous.  She expects your son to go into debt for a friggin vacation you can afford to pay for???  She sounds insufferable.  I care about a lot of things but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I can afford actually do them.", "she sounds SO hypocritical.", "So caring = money, in her eyes? But *she* doesn't care enough about them to pay either.  So they can toss that logic right back at her.\n\nShe also needs to understand that wages have not kept up with housing and food costs. Very literally,  it costs more today than it did when you and her were yours kids age.", "Ok, save it all and give it to them  when your  dead.\n\nThey will have a great vacation  and wishing you were there to join in the fun.\n\nExcept your dead\n\nTake them on a vacation and your grandchildren  will remember the fun times", "Save for vacation ???   Young families are saving when they need a new car, extra money to put down on the mortgage because  rates just went up.", "So by that logic if she cares so much she would pay for it so they could come a year is not enough time for a family of 4 to save entry for a cruise in today\u2019s economy you and her are quite out of touch with the world your children and grandchildren are living in", "Your son does care and is  probably saving money.....for his kids education, newer car in a few years, extra money to put down on the mortgage  (because rates just went up)\n\nVacation trips  to resorts or Disneywere a luxury when my kids were  giving up. It just wasn't  in the budget", "Listen, I want to do a lot of things with my bff. If I really want her to go somewhere but she doesn't have the money, I foot the bill. Because *I* want her to do something with me. She does the same with me.", "And PS do NOT allow your wife to ever, EVER mention that you paid for it. They enjoy the trip with the inlaws cause it's a fun, bonding time. Quite sure there is never any discussion of cost. Cause that's not what it is about. Your wife is being Petty, and driving your son away. Quite the opposite of what she wants ....", "well your wife is wrong. aren't parents supposed to like, care for their children? it just seems so selfish of you to have the money to provide a nice trip for your son but expect him to take out credit just to pay for it. like, ridiculous. who cares if he's an adult?", "Honestly, your personality trait is one of the reasons I divorced my ex. He tried to always play both sides until it was obvious (to me) that he was weak and only cared about himself (stay out of the drama).", "This is it exactly.", "I admit that I didn't love the line of credit suggestion, but I feel caught in the middle.", "Yeah, I am starting to think I am supporting the wrong side here", "How about you have a come to Jesus talk with your wife about how she\u2019s going down a path where all she\u2018s going to accomplish is isolating herself from her son with her misguided values.  To think that she thinks that your son and his family should go into debt because of her desperate need to have a vacation with them is ridiculous.  Give it to them for Christmas and consider it a gift to yourselves.  The memories you will have of your families vacation will be worth the money.  You\u2019ll regret it on your deathbed that you made this stupid, petty move your hill to die on.", "Stand up to your wife", "Too bad. Get out of the middle and tell your wife (your son\u2019s mother) that it is unreasonable to expect your son and his family to go into debt in order to go on a vacation your wife has orchestrated.", "starting to? jeez you are what 60 and you thought you were on the right side. \"please cancel the free vacation that you have had planned for a long time to spend way too much money and go into debt to go on a cruise with me even though i could easily afford to pay\"", "OP, it\u2019s not that you picked the wrong side, just the wrong business model. If your wife wanted something that made her incredibly happy and it cost $5000 that you absolutely could afford, what would you say? \n\nUnderneath all this, is what she wants time with her child and his family? Or for him to \u201cprove\u201d his love for his mom by saving up money and vacation hours to spend with her? \n\nHas she always made him jump through hoops?", "Yeah, you're right", "And then trying to lay a guilt trip on top of it. SMH. If my parents pulled that I wouldn\u2019t want to go on vacation with them even if I won the lottery.", "On the contrary - they used to be very close, and he could do no wrong.  I was the hoop-jumper.\n\nBut I have noticed recently, my wife does compare our relationship to his inlaws a bit too often.  Which isn't realistic, because they live locally whereas we are a few hours away.", "It is completely normal for one set of inlaws to get jealous of the other when one lives closer, sees the grandkids more etc.  \n\nCould you gift them this trip for Christmas or another celebratory reason?", "Your wife/Son\u2019s mother is setting everyone up for disaster, and you\u2019re going along with it. \n\nEven if I had the money, I wouldn\u2019t like being expected to take my PTO or vacation time plus paying completely out of pocket for a vacation someone else came up with. If someone else is fully paying the cost, then that might be a different story. \n\nIf you want your son and his family to go on vacation with you, pay for it. If you don\u2019t want to pay for it (fair enough), don\u2019t complain about it."]}
