He came to ask me what I remember about that day. I told him I remember him leaving for 2-3 hours (he says to \"pick up food for us\") to go to the bar & \"celebrate\" with his cousin (he did bring back food, but that's beside the point). I did have my mom there to help while he was gone but he didn't ask if it was OK or even tell me that he would be meeting up with his cousin at the bar until I called to ask whats taking so long. So, I told him I remember him leaving to go to the bar for several hours & I told him I remember him sleeping through the whole night & not waking up once to help with our son after I had just went through several hours of strenuous labor. He replied with \"well I was tired, what should I have done? If you were tired and I just had a baby I would have let you sleep and stayed up with the baby!\". He thinks IATA for saying this is what I remember about giving birth. I say he's the asshole for not realizing or admitting that his actions ON THE DAY I GAVE BIRTH were very wrong.

But, OP, why are you still with this man? I can't imagine he's suddenly become less selfish. I can't imagine he's a good father.

My \u201cbaby\u201d is 34. The day after my son was born my husband drove me home, dropped me off and went out with his dad all day. 34 years later I\u2019m still pissed off. Big whoop you were an addict and big whoop you\u2019re clean now. Clean up your side of the street. Do better and accept fault when you fuck up. Cuz buddy boy, you did. \n\nSweetheart, you deserve better. Do you really want to waste any more time on this dude? He really can\u2019t see that he\u2019s the asshole here?

I feel bad for the child cause their parents suck.", "NTA it sounds like this is something you have been needing to say to him for a while, and he stirred it all up choosing this event to write the paper about. Is he trying to make himself sound good in this paper, and you brought him back down to reality? He should be honest about it, especially if he is now sober and working on redeeming himself for his past actions.", "As Steve Harvey says: \u201cDon\u2019t make a habit of collecting red flags\u201d. You\u2019re making excuses for him by saying he was an addict. He may have been, but he\u2019s still currently an asshole. That hasn\u2019t changed.", "He was struggling with addiction when this happened. He has been sober for awhile now and has made some changes. Although, still lacks empathy & respect for me unfortunately.", "Yeah for everybody saying to leave him.. he has been very helpful ever since he got sober. Without him I wouldn't have been able to go to college or get my life together. So he definitely has been supportive. He is an amazing father & has been my best friend for 11+ years. He just lacks empathy & self reflection sometimes which in return hurts my feelings & makes me feel disrespected.", "I told him he should definitely include my memory in his paper for his instructor to read.. ya know.. since he thinks it wasn't a big deal.", "He really has. It's a process for sure but definitely has made huge strides over the past couple years.", "Yeah he definitely talks about more, but after that conversation I'm definitely good. Which is sad because as an only child myself, I want more kids.", "I know. The comment about him being the tired one literally might be the wildest thing I have ever heard somebody say. My jaw actually dropped. All I could say is \"you are so delusional\". Like I can't even argue with a person who would even think to say something like that.", "Yes I did", "When he wrote the paper? Or when the birth happened? If this conversation happened recently, please get out.", "People don't really learn empathy and respect as adults, and especially if they target their partner for disrespect. Please take care of yourself, OP.", "He sounds like a selfish narcissist.", "Part of recovery is him acknowledging those he hurt and he\u2019s not doing that. If you have to shield him from it, he\u2019s not in recovery\u2026he\u2019s just sober and you deserve better.", "You ARE being disrespected. You can still have him as a friend while he's not your partner. Please break up, you will see in time how unhealthy he was for you.", "There is a reason cause after birth you can have a visitor over night with you. And it\u2019s to let YOU rest and have help. Not for THEM to crash out and recover their hungover. Yes please have instructor read it, and be there at the reading!", "Him saying it wasn't a big deal that he disappeared during your labor and birth shows how little he views you as a person capable of independent thinking and feeling.", "I hope for you that you will, but with someone else! He sounds absolutely terrible as a father and as a fiance", "Yeah like 30 mins ago. I told him I posed it on reddit and he got so upset that other people aren't agreeing with him. He said \"you better tell the full story\" and I asked him to please tell me what the full story is and he had nothing besides \"some men don't even go to their kids births\". I'm a super empathic person so I just don't understand people who can't cop up and say sorry for their shitty behavior. Especially somebody who is supposed to love me.", "He's actually one of the best dads I know. Just a shitty partner.", "Yeah no fuck that noise, NTA.\n\nHe's not doing so well accepting responsibility for his actions and making reparations to the people his addiction hurt, is he? How does he plan on moving forward when he won't even be honest to himself about his past?", "If he\u2019s not saying sorry or empathizing with you now, while sober and actively hearing about a screw up from addiction says, he\u2019s never going to. Your empathy is reserved for him but what part will you start to offer to yourself?", "I would love for you to take your baby and get the hell out of that house.", "I wish you the best of luck in life and hope you don't have to deal with people who lack empathy and self accountability for long.", "I'm sorry, but he doesn't sound like someone who is able to love. he is not reflecting himself or you. This is ridiculous.", "He\u2019s a dick", "So, again, why are you still with him?", "Get off of Reddit, and take care of your kid!", "If he isn\u2019t a good partner, he isn\u2019t a good father. You have to respect, cherish, help, be considerate of your partner before you be a good parent.\n\n\u2018You need a new partner.", "A shitty partner? This is the kind of relationship you want your son to base his future relationships off of? Think about that .", "Remember that when kids grow up and move out to build their own families and their own lives, it's going to be only the two of you... Worth keeping in mind.", "Then let him be a good dad to his kid and go find yourself a better partner. Your kid deserves to see their mom loved and cared for as they grow up. Kids learn what they see. \n\nAlso - NTA, partner is TA", "Toxic and even abusive and dangerous people are good, often downright amazing, 90% of the time. If they weren't, they'd never trap people into life ruining relationships. Who he is at his worst is who he is. We're all judged by our worst behaviors. You deserve respect, support, and compassion. Love isn't love without those, and you will both teach your child how to love someone and what to accept as love from their partners in the future.", "The way he treats you doesn\u2019t set a good model for your child, plus it doesn\u2019t sound like he is able to bear the brunt of the sleepless nights. So I am still doubtful on the \"best dad\" title, I feel like the bar is too low, and I get why if he accustomed you to this :/", "Agree with this wholeheartedly. This is not what a child needs to see modeled as a healthy and loving relationship.", "My kid is 3, right next to me, perfectly healthy & taken care of, thanks though. Without your comment I totally would have forgotten about him!", "No I shouldn't have said that. He is a good partner 80% of the time.", "I think he was referring to your other kid, your supposed partner.", "That\u2019s a really low and very sad percentage OP. A good partner is good 99.9% of the time.", "Well if that's the case I'm sorry & I feel dumb lol."]}
