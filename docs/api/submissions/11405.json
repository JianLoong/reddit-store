Red flags OP even if you dont read. \n\nA big part of recovery, be it 12 step or another program, is attempting to either right wrongs or acknowledge your harm to others. \n\nYou mention he had an addiction before. If he was better this situation should have been addressed. It doesn't matter what you felt, it matters he caused it. \n\nIt isnt to make the addict feel shitty. Most addicts dont feel empathy and destroy everything around them. You can become an objectively better person and still have those personality traits. Thats where people are 'healthy enough' and slip back in. \n\nThis is a bigger issue than you acknowledge. No excuse for what happened, but a general \"I am sorry I  made you feel this way. I should have been more supportive but my addiction made me unable too\" is more than enough. It's hard as hell to face what you did. \n\nI have helped a lot of addicts through work. Went to AA with them. The people who recover and are better have one thing in common. All time they spent when an addict they are remorseful. Even days they consider good. Because an addict's good is still bad. They don't let it beat them up, they are stronger and better people now. But when someone else has an issue they try to mend the bridge but accept if the bridge cant. They never run from it. You accept you lost people and it is what it is. \n\nI am willing to bet a beer your partner would be offended by this. \n\nHe may never use again, but sounds like an addict still. And eventually, something will happen and those traits will come back out. Its really easy to take a step back and recognize you were a bad person then and acknowledge you dont want to be that person again. The you from today loves your partner and child and would spend every moment by their sides. That is the partner you deserve OP.", "Nta. As a kid I heard my birth story, and my mom said \"then your dad went to play in a softball tournament.\" My dad laughed. He still never grasped why their marriage failed.", "NTA.  You definitely are not the TA in this situation. \n\nEdit - After reading other comments.  Al Anon is a thing.  You should look into it.

I\u2019d have killed my boyfriend if he did that when we had our son.", "NTA. But on the bright side, he can learn from this. Let him read it. He lacks empathy, but I believe he can fake that until he makes it. Tell him to write the paper in 2 parts, one from his perspective and then one from yours. If he feels ambitious, he can write a trilogy and write it from the baby's point of view on missing his father that first night (and I'm sure many others). It will not be pleasant, but he needs to step outside himself for awhile to get proper perspective on the consequences of his actions, which is a journey he is only beginning and will need to complete before the tween years hit.", "Why is he writing a paper about an event he wasn\u2019t really present for?\n\nNTA.", "NTA- he asked, you answered truthfully.", "NTA.

And you owe it to your baby to spare them from that. \n\nMy oldest was 6 before I got the courage to leave. She tells people how she hates her dad because she saw how he treated me.

It hardly matters whether he's sober or not. He won't be for long if he isn't able to clearly see the consequences. And even if he does stay sober, who would want to spend time with someone who doesn't accept responsibility for their actions?  \n\n\nHe could have said something like \"I'm so sorry that I wasn't there, and I'll regret it for the rest of my life.\" Instead, he made excuses. I think that's all you need to know.", "Excuses excuses. You made your bed. Please lie in it. Don\u2019t ask strangers to take your side.

He has never taken responsibility for what he did that day, so it will always just be excuses. \n\n\nI\u2019ve had to make some seriously HARD amends in my recovery, and the hardest were the ones to those who still actively loved me and were at my side. It was easy to think that I wouldn\u2019t have to make amends, because if they were by my side, they clearly have forgiven me, right? Nope, not even close. Doesn\u2019t matter how many years later it is, if it\u2019s something that still hurts you- then it\u2019s something he needs to make amends for. \n\n\nYou\u2019re NTA- but take a close look at this- are there other areas of your life that you\u2019re low-key holding resentment about that he still hasn\u2019t made amends for?

Why are you still engaged to this person? Nothing you\u2019ve said makes anything better, or makes his recovery to addiction relevant", "Yeah, I agree with the original question. Why are you still with him? He lacks empathy for you and is selfish and seems a touch narcissistic. He can't accept when he's wrong and instead tries to blame you for confronting his behavior when it is not acceptable. He belittles your pain and struggles and only focuses on his. Honestly, does he have ANY good qualities because I can't see any.", "Get away. Now. I faced a nearly identical situation when my daughter was born, and I will tell you 2 things. 1) that resentment you feel will likely never (and I mean NEVER) go away. He will never be able to apologize enough. That will always stick in your mind. 2) he seems to feel no genuine remorse for his actions, and he doesn't seem to value you or respect your feelings. \nI promise you, you don't want to raise your son to grow up thinking this is the normal way to treat his partner.", "Some men, yes the ones who either cannot be there or don't want to be there.
