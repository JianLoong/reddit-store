Red flags OP even if you dont read. \n\nA big part of recovery, be it 12 step or another program, is attempting to either right wrongs or acknowledge your harm to others. \n\nYou mention he had an addiction before. If he was better this situation should have been addressed. It doesn't matter what you felt, it matters he caused it. \n\nIt isnt to make the addict feel shitty. Most addicts dont feel empathy and destroy everything around them. You can become an objectively better person and still have those personality traits. Thats where people are 'healthy enough' and slip back in. \n\nThis is a bigger issue than you acknowledge. No excuse for what happened, but a general \"I am sorry I  made you feel this way. I should have been more supportive but my addiction made me unable too\" is more than enough. It's hard as hell to face what you did. \n\nI have helped a lot of addicts through work. Went to AA with them. The people who recover and are better have one thing in common. All time they spent when an addict they are remorseful. Even days they consider good. Because an addict's good is still bad. They don't let it beat them up, they are stronger and better people now. But when someone else has an issue they try to mend the bridge but accept if the bridge cant. They never run from it. You accept you lost people and it is what it is. \n\nI am willing to bet a beer your partner would be offended by this. \n\nHe may never use again, but sounds like an addict still. And eventually, something will happen and those traits will come back out. Its really easy to take a step back and recognize you were a bad person then and acknowledge you dont want to be that person again. The you from today loves your partner and child and would spend every moment by their sides. That is the partner you deserve OP.", "Nta.

It hardly matters whether he's sober or not. He won't be for long if he isn't able to clearly see the consequences. And even if he does stay sober, who would want to spend time with someone who doesn't accept responsibility for their actions?  \n\n\nHe could have said something like \"I'm so sorry that I wasn't there, and I'll regret it for the rest of my life.\" Instead, he made excuses.

He clearly only changed as much as he needed to to get you off his back. You deserve better. What would you tell your child if their future partner was treating them this way?", "\ud83d\ude0a Only you know what's right in your relationship. We will never know the whole story. Best of everything to you.", "NTA\nWhat?!? So because some men are worse than him you should be grateful? So if he hits you, you should be grateful he doesn't kill you? Or what's the point in that logic?\nClearly addiction is not his only problem and you should run away asap.", "Ok, the father of my son was an ass after his birth too, but yours is worse. NTA at all. He should be groveling at your feet for the crap he pulled, and instead he\u2019s doubling down.", "My husband didn't attend the birth of our second child... Because I/we needed him to take care of our older boy, who has extra considerations. I'm sorry that your partner isn't actually doing his job as a partner.", "still don't understand why you're engaged.\n\nSounds like he's a grade A AH and is unwilling to hear how much of an ass he is. I wouldn't expect anything to be better in the future, and kids only get harder as time progresses.\n\nNTA. Furthermore his response to this thread is even worse. Lol.", "You should appreciate that he did the bare minimum? \"Some guys don't even go to their kids birth\" what a crock of...so applause for showing up and disappointing the only person actually doing work. Get him on the line right now!", "You're NTA, but you need to make him an ex because he doesn't really care about you or your feelings. The way he talks sounds like an abuser as well. \n\nI have to laugh at him excusing his behavior by saying that he was tired as if *you* weren't exhausted from literally birthing a human being. He has some audacity for sure. \n\nRun now. You may have a baby with him, but that doesn't mean that you have to stay with him. This isn't a good relationship for baby & you. He can't empathize & excuses his behavior instead of owning up to it. \n\nWalking away might not be easy. You can't save or change him. This is who he is & he's showing you that. Believe him & do better for baby & you.", "this won't magically improve with marriage.", "And what kind of example will it set for your baby? NTA", "She's good.  Spent just 3 days in NICU and has had moderate asthma all her life and was/is prone to respiratory infections but graduated from EMT school with her twin brother in December.  Just moved in with her BF and is now 21.  Thank you!", "Mine went home and made dozens of cookies for his coworkers. When I asked for one (I was still in the hospital), he said no.", "Glad to hear that!", "Why are so many men like this after their partners give birth? I had a C-Section and he fell asleep while I was holding the baby. I couldn't sit up to put her down so I could waddle to the bathroom. So I kept calling his name for help. Eventually I powered through the pain and sat up (almost popping stiches). He then sat up and said \"See, I knew you could do it if you just tried!\".", "Oh my god.  Seriously?!  I\u2019m so damn sorry.  You deserve better. Soooo much better.  Did you find better?", "Holy crap what is wrong with my gender.  When we had our kid,  would wake up every time she cried, to try and help.  I can luckily go back to sleep quick(even if I couldn't) so would wake up for feeding, get our kid, change her give her to my wife to breast feed, microwave then take her back and put her back to sleep.  We worked as a team, even made sleep schedules based on what time the other had to go to work.  That way the ones working would get at least 3 hrs of uninterrupted sleep.  Would have liked to help more but only got 3 days off for paternity leave.  I am sorry peoples partners are lazy AH.", "I think we were with the same guy lol"]}
