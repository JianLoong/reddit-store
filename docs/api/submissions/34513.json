The husband was significantly more of an AH than OP. I do not want this to come off as them being equal in that sense. I just think if it was as disappointing as OP said it was, she should have communicated that to him privately the next day before that meeting.

And the worse part isn't that he forgot your birthday or clearly loves the dog more then you. The worst part isn't even that once he remembered it was your birthday he ditched you to get drunk with his friends. The worst part is that he dosen't care about your feelings at all. He isn't sorry he made you feel bad, he's dosen't care that you are disappointed, he dosen't care how you feel period. How he feels though, that's important. He ditched you beacuse it was fun for him. He didn't like you bringing it up beacuse it made him look bad (meaning he *knows* it's sh\\*ty behavior). He dosen't like you bringing it up with him one on one either, beacuse that's annoying.\n\nSo in summary: His feelings matter, then the dogs, yours not at all. You should have zero expectations of him and pretend he cares about you in public.

It sounds like the reaction was more concerned about his image. Maybe he still doesn't know he was wrong lol!

That is a very dangerous thing in a marriage.", "If he can remember the freaking dog\u2019s birthday, he has zero excuse for forgetting his **wife\u2019s** birthday.", "Oh wow. I have to admit that when I first read this one I somehow missed the part about the mom calling to say happy birthday, so I was thinking that the husband didn't even know it was her birthday until the next day, possibly not until the moment her friends brought it up at dinner. But the fact that he freaking knew it was her b-day by the middle of that day makes it like 50% worse! Jeez what a complete dick.", "Why mention it at all???  He didn\u2019t give her even they courtesy of a Happy Birthday.", "Nothing extreme about what OP said to her friends. Telling the truth isn\u2019t public shaming.", "I think he meant to say \"it's just *your* birthday\" becaus obviously the dog's birthday means a lot to him, and I bet his own does as well.", "Does he even *like* you?", "\u2026 So does your husband have any redeeming qualities? Cause he sounds like a jerk.", "NTA. I\u2019d be interested to know what he said/did once he realized he\u2019d forgotten it? What was the immediate conversation? How did he justify going out with friends on your birthday? I\u2019m wondering if he didn\u2019t forget, maybe just didn\u2019t bother?", "It's just *your* birthday is what he is really saying. NTA", "Since it\u2019s \u201cjust a birthday\u201d let his next one completely skip your mind.", "NTA He was the jerk not you. Your husband screwed up. Why are you worried about his feelings when he totally ignored yours?", "Yea, also how old is this dog? I wonder if he is always extra excited for the dog's birthday. In a way, it seemed intentional, as if he wanted to hurt OP. Now, he is upset, because others are aware that he forgot her birthday.", "It's crazy to me how many of my friends are married to misogynistic dog lovers. It's enough that I've started to view guys who make a Big Fuss over their dogs as waving a bit of a yellow warning flag (talking to them in baby voices,  ignoring the people around them to have one-way conversations with the dog, going all out for gifts for the dog in celebrating holidays the dog doesn't understand, taking the dog on special trips,  insisting the dog needs special accommodations); especially if they engage in those kind behaviors just before or after failing to do a nearly parallel thoughtfulness in their human relationships. \n\nIt's like they have a dog specifically so they can use it in a little hurtful, pointed, elaborately staged nonverbal message saying, \"You're worth less than my dog.\"", ">None of my friends celebrate their birthdays.\n\nAre you sure? Maybe they just celebrate it with their families or other friends and just not with you, knowing how much you are against celebrating birthdays."]}
