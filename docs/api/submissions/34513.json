Also if you want to stay with him, I would very explicitly expect that he plan some sort of a \u201cmake up birthday\u201d where he spoils you because to me.

When His Birthday rolls around say this phrase in your head: \" \u201c come on, is just a birthday\u201d.  Do not do anything special for him. DO NOT.  He was in the wrong here, He KNOWS he was in the wrong, he refuses to admit it, refuses to apologize, and is treating you horribly!  So, don't cave and feel bad for him when it's HIS birthday.

Could or should you have not said anything at dinner?  Maybe.  Hindsight and all that.  But did he even apologize for forgetting the day of?  Did he offer to make it up to you?  You could have handled it differently by confronting him sooner.  He lashed out most likely because he's embarrassed, but that's an explanation, not an excuse.\n\nYou could open up the line by apologizing, but also explaining that while you meant no malice, you were hurt by his actions.

My partner is rly bad with dates (birthdays, concerts, partys...), but he never forgets my birthday.", "NTA...he deserved some public shaming for his shitty behaviour.  Especially justified since he gaslit you after for calling him out.", "Esh.\n\nHe shouldn't forget your birthday (or should forget dog's birthday, one or other LOL.\n\nYou shouldn't denigrate him in public. ,(public displays of disrespect to your man are equivalent to public discussion on a women's reputation).", "You both are AH IMO. \n\nHim for forgetting the birthday and going out with friends instead. \n\nYou for not having that conversation privately with him when it was obviously bothering you. Instead you tried to embarrass him in front of your friends as payback.\n\nEdit: I just want to be clear because my first sentence was poorly written. That is on me. The husband was significantly more of an AH than OP. I do not want this to come off as them being equal in that sense. I just think if it was as disappointing as OP said it was, she should have communicated that to him privately the next day before that meeting. I don't think OP would have made the joke she did, which by husband's reaction, was probably very sarcastic or  meant to make him look like a dick. \n\nYes, he was a dick, but maybe I am just crazy, but when did it start to be cool to try to expose our loved one's mistakes to our friends? I thought that was something we worked out privately and only tried to support our partners publicly. Maybe I am not up with the times.", "NTA but seriously, who over 15 celebrates their birthday.

If that\u2019s how it is, then your husband doesn\u2019t deserve anything for his birthday either.

And the worse part isn't that he forgot your birthday or clearly loves the dog more then you. The worst part isn't even that once he remembered it was your birthday he ditched you to get drunk with his friends. The worst part is that he dosen't care about your feelings at all. He isn't sorry he made you feel bad, he's dosen't care that you are disappointed, he dosen't care how you feel period. How he feels though, that's important. He ditched you beacuse it was fun for him. He didn't like you bringing it up beacuse it made him look bad (meaning he *knows* it's sh\\*ty behavior). He dosen't like you bringing it up with him one on one either, beacuse that's annoying.\n\nSo in summary: His feelings matter, then the dogs, yours not at all. You should have zero expectations of him and pretend he cares about you in public. Then at home you should just never show any feelings that cause him inconvenience beacuse he dosen't care about them anyway.\n\nI hope you realize not all men are like this.

It sounds like the reaction was more concerned about his image. Maybe he still doesn't know he was wrong lol! That is my point and why we have conversations for expressing how we are feeling, understanding each other, and learning.\n\nI am not saying that husband isn't a big time AH.
