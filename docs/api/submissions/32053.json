He goes to bed alone, wakes up, and goes to work while you sleep. I would not be in that kind of relationship. One of the best parts of my day is going to bed together with my wife.

Yes, you are the asshole", "YTA pretty easily", "You're allowed to do those things but I certainly wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone like that.  Maybe you're trustworthy but people who live that lifestyle tend to enjoy a different type of fun. It's just not compatible with the 9-5 daytime schedule person.

Part of it is just that your schedules are so out of synch, but the other part is that it sounds like you're spending a lot more social time with people other than him - and that might feel a bit lonely and disconnecting for him.\n\nThis - if not already - is likely to become a relationship issue for you both to deal with.

As long as you spend time with him also, and aren\u2019t coming home drunk every day or being disruptive then I\u2019d say there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. Just be mindful. What kind of hours are you working that allows you to be that flexible? I work school hours and I couldn\u2019t be out until 4/5, id be ruined needing to be ready for 8am at the latest! My OH works nights and obviously he\u2019d be at work during that time.

Yeah, YTA.  \n\n\nWhat place is even OPEN at 4:00 am?  What kind of job do you have that you can stay out until 4:00 and it not have consequences?  What is happening here?", "u seem shady, it\u2019s def a red flag and I don\u2019t blame him for not liking it lmao u sound like a lot to deal with", "YTA. Getting home at 4-5 am is extremely sus and your bf is probably very paranoid about it. Once in a while on a friends birthday or something is fine but sheesh. I would have left you by now", "YTA. Doing something that you know your bf doesn\u2019t like is shitty. I\u2019d break up with you without much thought", "NTA\n\nYou can do what you want but if I were the BF I would break up with you.\n\nYou are obviously still stuck in party mode and are too immature to be in a relationship.\n\nNote:  Sooner or later, you're going to find yourself in trouble and when you do, do NOT call your BF and expect him to come rushing to help you.", "NTA but I wouldn't stay in a relationship with you", "Do you work or study? Is he the one paying the bills since he is working. Then definitely YTA and he should leave you. If you just want to party you do you but other people with jobs and responsibilities are over that faze. Maybe find a bf who is into partying like you?", "I wouldn't be cool with it either. It's very sketchy behavior just imagine the reverse happening and he's out with girls all night for some \"Karaoke\". This gives hard \"Don't worry about him. He's just a friend\" vibes. I don't know of too many guys that would be okay with it. \n\nRegardless, Even if you were in the right this is clearly something that really upsets your boyfriend. It says a lot that you're trying to seek validation from people online rather than your own boyfriend. You're trying to find ammo for him to throw in his face to try to undermine his feelings and that's just not right. You are your own person and you are free to do what you want but so is he. And if I were him I would leave if this continued.", "NTA, as long as you don't mind him doing the same when he has spare time in the evening. In the end it's all about love and trust.

I should have broken up with him two years sooner than I did.", "Nta because you probably aren\u2019t doing anything wrong. But honestly you coming home when im waking up and about to leave for work when i know you weren\u2019t working but \u201changing out\u201d with friends, would cause me to end that relationship.", "YTA. What bars close at 5am?  You aren\u2019t just going to karaoke. You\u2019re sleeping around.", "I feel like there is to little information here to truly say if you are or aren\u2019t the asshole. Does he not want you going out because you arrive home stumbling drunk and he\u2019s worried for your safety or simply because he doesn\u2019t trust the guys that go with y\u2019all? We are missing his reason for not wanting you to do this which is kinda an important piece of the puzzle.", "Not enough info, honestly. Have you two had a serious talk about it? How many times has he mentioned his discomfort? Is he controlling? How many times do you spend the night out a month or a week? Have you tried to reach a compromise, like a certain number of night-outs a month?", "INFO: how often do you do this? what\u2019s the specific issue your boyfriend has?", "NAH. But I seriously think you both should talk and compromise on this. If you only recently started going out for a whole night, and plan on doing this more often, then if I find out my bf wasnt too happy about it, thats when I would slow down, talk and work out a compromise. Because I can see you coming back home at 5 when hes going to work, and you say if you have classes at noon, how is that gonna be enough sleep for you? When do you come back home from classes? Do you sleep any longer to where your bf gets home and hes pretty much alone until around bedtime? \n\nAlso, are you coming back home on the loud tipsy side right before he wakes up?", "Nit enough info. Do you and your BF do things together or is your social life totally dependent on doing things without him. Leave him if he\u2019s not taking your relationship seriously; otherwise he should leave you if he\u2019s a good partner and you\u2019re still doing this. Your behavior is the \u201cbefore\u201d part of most stories of infidelity. Even if you don\u2019t plan to cheat, you are exposing yourself to too many opportunities to change you mind while he\u2019s still in before", "NTA. But are you working as well but just not paying the bills ?", "Opinion based off of your replies in this thread:\n\nYTA - You don't want the dude to know your friends, you aren't even inviting him to go with you, no wonder your BF doesn't like this, he's not even involved in a big part of your life, doesn't even have a connection to your friends, etc. This relationship will fail, might not be now, a week, a month, or even a year but it will fail.\n\nI'd break up with him and just pull the plug if you're that uncomfortable with him, and I'm honestly surprised he hasn't already, 6 years of this?! Dude needs to run.\n\nBefore y'all downvote click her profile, read her replies to questions, then come back.", "NAH but I don\u2019t think you guys are compatible.", "NTA,\n\nYou guys are incompatible.", "I think it is important that people in relationships live life together in a similar lifestyle. \n\nNTA for wanting to enjoy life and have fun while you\u2019re young. \nYou two might not be at the same place in life and might not be compatible.\nPersonally, I dont think people should be in serious relationships until at least late 20\u2019s. There is too much life to live and you dont want to settle down.\n\nYTA if you are serious about this relationship or are stringing him along. He can\u2019t stay out all night because of responsibilities. You either need to commit or move on. Either option is fine, but doing what you are doing is not acceptable.", "How often are you going out? Is the issue that you are stumbling in and waking him up? Is this happening on weekdays? \n\nAll of that is relevant to if you are in the wrong here. Staying out till 4 or 5 am regularly with friends alone while in a committed relationship is a bit of a red flag though regardless.", "NTA but it sounds like your BF and you aren't well matched. You want different things. There's nothing wrong with that but you aren't marrying this guy.", "NAH, it's fine to enjoy going out and partying with your friends late at night, it's fun and so long as there's no squirrelly shit going on then it's totally innocent. That being said it's not unreasonable for your boyfriend to dislike all this, and it comes down to a basic incompatibility problem. \n\nI would talk to him and figure out what aspect of it he doesn't like. If he's insecure and thinks you're cheating or something, it's a very different issue than if he feels left out and wants to go out with you.", "NTA based on the info given. You're not sneaking around. \nDid he say why he didn't like this? That could influence my vote.", "NTA, but it seems your lives may not be compatible. It happens as people mature at different rates. Seems he is ready to grow up, maintain a job, and be on a schedule where you\u2019re more interested in hanging out late with your friends and sleeping in. Nothing wrong with either, I can understand both of your frustrations, just seems you\u2019re at different stages of your lives.", "I was honestly close to N A H thinking maybe just differing stages in life and you need to deal with it or go your separate ways but all your comments catapult you to AH. \n\nThe most glaring is you \u201cdon\u201dt mix relationships and friends\u201d um wtf. You\u2019re young but not that young that makes 0 fucking sense. You guys are living tg and you just don\u2019t mix them? If there was anything that made me think my girl wanted to cheat that\u2019s at the top of the list.\n\nAnd you need him to be the bad guy so bad that you equate hin drinking one night with his colleagues on a business trip to you going out multiple times till 6 am? Again you\u2019re young but you can\u2019t possibly believe those are the same thing. \n\nYoure clearly at different stages and still young so if you guys can\u2019t come to an understanding then end it but don\u2019t like like his protests and concerns have no merit", " if you come home so late, then yes you are. your bf will probably think you cheated on him. If I were him I would RUN", "Streets behavior. I would dump you faster than you could get a word in", "Hard when people want to have a single life being \u201cmarried\u201d.

Go live your single life. Don\u2019t live with someone.", "YTA. You\u2019re not ready for a serious relationship. You can\u2019t act single while being in a relationship. His concern is valid .", "NTA . But expect to get dumped if you keep it up.", "Hanging with your friends once in a while is good. Whooping it up on the regular with them is going to make your bf suspicious. \n\nThis might be a good time to start doing what successful couples do and communicate. Get your individual priorities straight and your priorities as a couple straight. \n\nAfter that, ssk yourself some questions. \n\nHow does going out until midnight help your relationship?  How does it detract?\n\nWhat are the long-term effects of this behavior? \n\nWhat need does it fill?", "Do you not feel even a little guilty of watching him be tired from providing for the both of you while you go out and chill with friends after he is asleep, then coming in as he\u2019s getting ready to head back to work? I feel like you N. T. A. But I couldn\u2019t do that while watching my gf work her butt off to provide for us both.", "NTA but he will likely get tired of not sleeping next to you. Have you heard the saying about ships passing in the night?", "Yta\n\nI wouldnt count on this lasting.

You're not ready for that yet. You still want to go out and have fun. You're 20 something years old. There is nothing wrong with that and you shouldn't feel bad. It's just something you may want to talk to your boyfriend about. Not breaking up, but maybe not living together either.", "Is he the only person working? \n\nNo judgement here. If I was working while my Partner had fun and spent the money, yeah, I\u2019d get the shits. \n\nIf you both work, you\u2019re on an even playing field and it comes down to how you want to spend your life and how you want to respect your partners feelings.

If you're in a relationship and your significant other dislikes this action you need to have a serious talk about it and establish boundaries. If you choose to continue to violate your significant other's boundaries the relationship will end. (And if you've had this discussion and your violating your significant other's boundaries then sorry YTA).\n\n2. You are putting yourself at risk. This would go for any gender of person. If you're out drinking \"alone\" (as in without your partner) late at night there is a chance you're going to need your partner to come and get you in the middle of the night as nothing good happens after midnight. Ruining your partners sleep which will then impact their day at work following.\n\nOn a side note. If you're working a non-night shift job IE a \"9 to 5\" you will not be able to sustain this lifestyle for long.

Enjoy it now in your 20s bc when you're old like me, you'll be in bed by 10 lol.\n\nHowever, he has a different perspective on it. It doesn't sound like he's prohibiting you from going out, he's just expressing his discomfort with it. Why don't you sit down with him and have an in-depth conversation about it?

It's that this is a functional incompatibility between the way two people in a relationship are choosing to live their lives. \n\nThis kind of lifestyle by one person affects the other one, no matter how much the night owl believes it doesn't, especially if you are living together. There is a reason why most jobs require everyone to work generally overlapping hours. Maybe not everyone needs to be there 9-5, but somewhere in the range of 10-6 or 8-4, so you have a big chunk of time where you are able to work together. A relationship is similar in that way. You can't be out until 4 am every night and not sleep in until 1pm the next day. You're cutting into your relationship time when you do this consistently. If OP is going out this late one a month or so, that's fine. If it's most days of the week, that's a problem.", "I'm sorry I thought you were intentionally missing the point. My bad.\n\nIt's not about a bedtime. This is about a relationship. I myself don't hang out with women especially at night if I'm in a relationship. Too much respect for my partner. I also wouldn't regularly come home when they are headed to work. This isn't a 1 time occurrence and OP already said she might start drinking on these nights. \n\nAside from all this 4-5am is nuts for a girl in a relationship to be out regularly. \n\nI date to eventually marry and not for fun.

And in *another* comment you say you don't mix friends and relationships. And you've been together 6 years. And this going out is a new thing. \n\nI sense there are deeper seated issues beyond you just going out. Your actions imply (as others have pointed out) that you seem ashamed of your BF (because you won't introduce him to friends, for 6 years now presumably) and you have one foot out the door already. Now, in *addition* to keeping him separate from your friends you're going out all night semi consistently. No matter what your words say to him, your actions are basically saying that you're done with him.\n\nI still think you're incompatible as you've grown as people based on everything you have said.
