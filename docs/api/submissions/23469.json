He probably did not come out and say it directly, but perhaps being embarrassed to be living with his kid, he made statements designed to lead his gf to believe that you were the one living there rent-free.\n\nMy guess is that both needed to be splashed with a bit of wake-up reality, which you provided.", "YTA.

I just couldn\u2019t envision myself staying with someone that was doing me a favor and asking to add an additional body. In that situation I\u2019d move in with the extra person. Not have them move in with me into a home I don\u2019t own.", "NTA Your Dad should have apologized and admitted being embarrassed instead of doubling down.

What kind of woman would date your father for a few months and then send nasty texts trying to kick you out behind his back???\n\nThis woman is not the brightest spark because it\u2019s pretty obvious that you would discuss this with your father.", "Your dad WAS embarrassed -- embarrassed that he was relying on his son's generosity, and so he either straight-up lied to her or just omitted the pertinent data and let her draw her own conclusions. \n\nI don't know if there was a better way to handle it, but you're NTA for your decision. The dad shouldn't have lied to save face, the GF shouldn't have talked about it like that to you (if she was going to butt in, she could at least have approached it more gently and then you could have had a real conversation and let her know the facts), and when you confronted them, they could have had the decency to be chagrined.", "NTA - I would have done the same. Kick the GF out and if dad want's to follow her, then he can. Nothing wrong in letting your dad choose who he wants to lay in bed with but he has to live the with consequences.\n\nYou also made her wish come true as well. you and her no longer live together so she can now do whatever she wants in her own house.", "Woah ok this gives me flash backs! When me & hubby were first married & our first born on the way we lived in a charity owned house (no complaints it was a lovely cottage & they were brilliant landlords) my FIL came back on the scene after 20 odd years after walking out on my hubby when he was 4 (zero contact in between) but this would his first grandchild so suddenly felt paternal. Hubby stupidly thought he\u2019d give him the benefit of the doubt. By this time he was on his 5th marriage (man he loved wedding cake!) and this wife was very much the gold digger sort who fell for his BS of being loaded. He\u2019d told her he owned our house and was letting us live there rent free while we got ourselves sorted. She started with saying we should pay rent of some sort but never on front of FIL. Hubby always stayed quiet in these conversations & I never spoke up because I was not one for confrontation on those days. Hubby would just say \u201csit on your perch and wait\u201d whenever I asked him why he didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nAny way one day they came round for dinner & my hubby mentions he\u2019s thought about him paying rent to FIL; FIL goes quiet & she looks smug so my hubby suddenly gets up & gets our rent book ( yes we\u2019re going back 30 odd years here!) with the property owners name on it and proceeds to tell her that FIL doesn\u2019t own our property & never has; hubby then proceeded to tell her all about FIL history (she didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d been married before) and quite a few home truths about her \u201crich\u201d husband including his other children she knew nothing about! Amazingly FIL cut all contact with us & she divorced him so all round a very satisfying day!", "Absolutely NTA \n\nI can see you added that your dad told his girlfriend he owned the house.... Haha.

Didn't care.\n\nAbout 2 years after that, I told him he had to leave, too. I was being taken advantage of. He treated me like dirt, made constant insane demands.

He would constantly try to get me to spend my entire weekends doing stuff with him, and when I'd explain no, I have a wife and kids...he'd get all pissed off and say how lonely he is all by himself. Like bro, I'm not making you stay in all by your self. Go fucking do something. So I found a senior apartment complex where he got an apartment for $150 a month, and I moved him there.

As a second, it wasn't her place to make such demands. If the scenario had been true, it would have been your dad's call. She's not even been with him a year, either.\n\n\nNta", "Your dad played a game called mess around and find out. He lied, what did he think was going to happen? At least his girlfriend can enjoy that cold cheap rental she was talking about", "Awesome! They can not only side with but have the privilege of housing them since they feel so strongly about it.\n\nHang in there OP. This will be over soon. Make sure your credit and all is protected so they can't screw you over in any other way.", "You\u2019re better off without people who can\u2019t see beyond his lies.\n\nIn my experience, family can be the community you build and love you and respect you. There only seems to be lies and manipulation.\n\nI would reframe this a bit to \u2018my family are people not lucky enough to have what I have or see the worlds as I do, so they fall prey to the influence of manipulators.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m so sorry he pulled this on you. Just keep in mind, up until a few days ago he was so good at manipulation that even you still believed he was a good guy while he was around telling lies on you.", "Nah. Fuck that. Under what standard is it being an asshole for cussing at some pile of turd that's trying to take your shit. \nYou reacted very nicely according to my standard.", "NTA. \n\nThe fact that they are staying with each other after greedy Janice learned the truth and your thankless dad learned what she had messaged you reveals they are both entrenched, awful people. \n\nI'm sorry you got dragged into this mess, but thanks for sharing so we could enjoy being shocked at the utter gall of these people.\n\nDid Janice say anything to you once you revealed the truth?", "The lie has spiralled.", "Dad is telling Janice how he transferred the house into his son\u2019s name for some not quite believable reason and this is the thanks he gets.", "She is psychotic and went from 0-calling the cops in no time, but the fact that she felt she could/should call the cops makes me wonder what dear ol dad has been saying to her.", "I\u2019D be a little concerned on whatever damage comes to the *house* because of OP Ned Stark-ing his shitty family.", "I wouldn't be concerned. I simply wouldn't give a rat's ass.", "What do you think the chances are that dad is trying new lies to cover up the old ones?", "It is crazy even if what she thought was true. You don\u2019t come at someone like that and expect good results.", ">You must have looked really entitled to her with your father's complete misrepresentation. It doesn't excuse her actions, but explains them a little\n\nExcuse me, but what??  OP has known this bitch for exactly three months. His life is literally none of her business, and her opinion of it is irrelevant. She is a massive, entitled, interferring asshole, and there is zero explanation or justification for what she did.", "How did she miss that OP goes to work like an adult? And that he\u2019s not ordering his dad around like the entitled AH he\u2019s been painted as?", "I want to know as well!", "She probably thought she was doing dad a favor because he was \"too sweet to stand up to his son\".", "Talking about body gives me impression of bringing a corpse In", "\"to become their problem.\" \n\nI gave the same advice to my ex-wife's soon-to-be ex husband. He had caught her cheating, and mentioned all the shit her parents were saying to him. \"They just want you to work it out with her so she won't be their problem.\"", "Sounds like he specifically didn't want the girlfriend there and told his dad that if he leaves her he could stay. So it's not even like he was necessarily trying to force him out so much as force her out and he refused.to.leave her so he go bundled into the eviction. Stupid games stupid prizes...", "If this one is real - NTA", "This!", "Maybe even the sister was unaware and knew that the house was owned by her dad?", "I am leaving open the possibility that the rest of it is true, but now OP is so mad at her that he is... ah... Retroactively making himself sound more hardcore in his recounting of the messages.", "For real, it's a perfect revenge story that reddit loves, but life is rarely this dramatic or perfect. This reads like a TV show not real life", "this.\nthe situation, sure. betting this has happened. to someone. \nthe text messages? not so much. i'm open to being proven wrong though, that'd be fucked up.", "Agreed that the situation sounds realistic, but the narrative voice is off. Especially for someone mature enough to be a homeowner at a young age, support their parent, be generous with his significant other\u2026 it\u2019s a very rapid, impulsive escalation, especially via text.", "It\u2019s a repost / stolen from one I saw here about six months ago", "I didn't realize that you have an exhaustive list of every human behaviour in every situation, lol", "Unfortunately actions have consequences and respect is earned, not given. Forgiving behavior like hers only causes a repeat of the behavior. They are grown adults who made their bed and now have to lie in it. They can sort their things out from the airbnb where they're staying now.", "She's an adult and shouldn't have involved herself in this, even if the house belonged to the dad.", "If someone had told me they owned their home and their kid was living rent-free when it was the other way round, I still wouldn\u2019t have gone to insulting them and threatening them with the police. At most, I might have fished for their plans, what they intend to do, where they see themselves in five year\u2019s time. \n\nAnd backtracked immediately and grovelled and been furious with my lying partner.", "I read it as a bluff.", "He\u2019s telling her whatever it takes to keep banging her. Crazy is a lot of trouble but usually great in bed, on the kitchen counter, back porch, attic, broom cupboard, hiking trail, on the back of a moving police car\u2026", "I once asked a lawyer: \"Can I lie?\". \"Sure, you just have to be able to keep track of all of your lies.\"  \n\n\nDad is not keeping track.", "It's stupid, but we have *no idea* what else the dad had lied about. He probably said his kid is financially abusing him, to explain why he's broke. She might be reacting to an even bigger lie, thinking her boyfriend is stuck in an abusive parent-child cycle, and thinks she's actually rescuing the dad from a horrible, but made up, situation. \n\nThe dad is an asshole above most, everyone else seems just to be reacting to the aftermath of dad's lies", "They only started dating January of this year! The audacity she has to speak to OP like that, whether he owns the house or not is appalling. Like, you're brand new. Chill out.", "Yes, she was waaaaay out of line. There\u2019s no excuse for what she did.", "You guys may as well start a support group because I'm betting there will be more victims of this woman and her family", "It doesn't matter what he was saying about you or whether it was true. She's only known ya few months and it's not her place to do what she did. It's a real dick move to have treated you like that. You just gave her some of her own medicine. Is it what the Dalai Lama would do? Nah. Is it exactly what she asked for? Hell yeah.", "Maybe, but that seems odd. Unless he doesn't talk much to his sister", "Yes and I said she's a mess and was out of line ...\n\nsomeone can be in the wrong and be a victim too - they are not mutually exclusive", "I have heard the expression \u201cDead fish and house guests stink in 3 days.\u201d", ">In my culture we\u2019ve got a saying that translates roughly to \u201cmoochers and dead people stink after 3 days\u201d\n\nWhat's your culture? Also, how do you actually say it (i.e. untranslated - I like using different translators/dictionaries and seeing the nuances of stuff like this)?", "It\u2019s \u201cel muerto y el arrimado despu\u00e9s de tres d\u00edas apestan.\u201d I\u2019m from Ecuador", "Oh nice, thanks! My next door neighbour is from Ecuador, I'll ask her about some of those words and the saying.", "In English it's leftovers and houseguests that stink :)."]}
