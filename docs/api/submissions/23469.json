But you only Schuld kick out her, not your father.", "NTA\n\nThey played a stupid game and won the brilliant prize of being homeless. Congrats to them. And will dive to you for owning a mortgage free house, that's a great accomplishment at your age.", "NTA. Why is your dad still with her after seeing the messages. \n\nI love how she was ok with kicking you out. But when the tables turned, you're apparently an A H. They got what they deserved.", "NTA - Janice is a piece of work and so is your dad. But I applaud you for the response! She deserved everything you dished to her. Keep up the good work.", "Yikes.  Ok the name calling may have been out of line, but high running emotions can some times cloud judgement.  All in all NTA.  They FAFO.  If the rest of your family is so supportive of your father lieing he, and his girlfriend can go live, and mooch of them instead.", "NTA. The girlfriend is an ahole *but so is your father*", "NTA", "NTA but clearly your father was lying to his partner, and. not just about who owns the house. I wouldn't have called her the name you did. She's well out of line and they need to move out.", "NTA oh my god the nerve of her!!!! Do you think your dad told her it was his house or that she just assumed? Seems odd she'd go straight to you without at least mentioning it to him first, at which point I'd have thought he'd set her straight.", "NTA. She was trying to kick you to the curb and ended up there herself!", "One hour on Reddit and this?  SMH", "NTA.  Stand your ground on this, OP!", "NTA \n\nYour dad needs to grow a backbone. I think he told her it's his house and you were living with him. \nThat's his fault for lying.\nThen she tried to kick you out because she didn't know he was living with you. \n\nSo where do his lies end? He's clearly full of it and I wouldn't be surprised if she tried to screw you out of the house or just try claim squatters rights.\n\nLet them have fun in the cold rental they will find. \n\nThe audacity is shocking and the fact your dad wants you to just forgive and forget blows my mind. She wanted you out on the street and showed no sympathy when she thought she ruled the roost. Don't let her back in, even to use the toilet, just remember she was going to see you homeless, you owe her no loyalty and your dad didn't show you any.\n\nTreat people the same way they treat you, especially when it's family.", "NTA, the entitlement of that woman dear lord. I think you were fully justified in kicking them to the curb, I sure as heck would\u2019ve. \n\nYou LET your father live with you, I\u2019m assuming rent free for almost 2 years, if he hadn\u2019t gotten so comfortable he\u2019d have the means to move out.

Your dad was insulting you behind your back and lying he's an ungrateful prick who doesn't need your generous help. And his girlfriend had no right to try and push you out. Even if he hadn't been lying to her it would have been his job to talk to you, not for a woman he hasn't even been seeing for a year to try and butt her head in. They brought this in themselves and I personally think you don't need to feel any guilt.", "NTA - Don't bite the hand that puts a roof over your head when you can't afford to do it without their help. \n\nOP did a generous thing. His dad demonstrated a keen lack of gratitude for it.", "NTA even though this sounds lowkey made up \ud83d\udc80", "NTA although this sounds made up, I congratulate you because it properly made me laugh. I'd have enjoyed getting these text messages, just so I could feel that joy as reality hit. I may be an arsehole myself.", "If this one is real - NTA\n\nHonestly, I don't see a problem. You gave them three month... in May. They should be moving out very soon, even without this confrontation. They should know this and have a different accommodation prepared. It's not your fault they don't.", "NTA but I wouldn't be surprised if your dad lied to her so she really thought it was his house", "NTA.\n\nThe gf way overstepped.  If you had been living with your father instead of the other way around, it still would have been his place/responsibility to talk to you and give you a deadline to move out, not hers.  She sounds like everything you called her.  However, I would guess that your father gave her the impression that it was his house.  He probably did not come out and say it directly, but perhaps being embarrassed to be living with his kid, he made statements designed to lead his gf to believe that you were the one living there rent-free.\n\nMy guess is that both needed to be splashed with a bit of wake-up reality, which you provided.", "YTA. Not for kicking them both out, but for escalating the conversation by name calling. She probably was not aware that you owned the house, because your dad lied to her. No need for name calling.", "NTA\n\nThey are both grown adults and can get a place of their own. Her thoughts didn\u2019t come from no where though, so your dad was probably telling some lies to make himself look better and got caught. Seeing how he wouldn\u2019t leave her for acting like this, he knew it was probably coming. I would take precautions though OP since they were living in your house for sometime make sure you do this legally so this doesn\u2019t come to bite you in the butt.", "NTA kids aren't responsible for taking care of their parents who don't have their shit together in the first place, and if he didn't tell her off and take your side, he can sleep in the bed he rents.", "In a reply OP said their sister heard dad telling people he owned the house to make himself look better. They deserve each other.", "Why?", "OP opens his home to his dad. \n\nScenario 1 : Dad is embarrassed of his living situation, lies about it to his gf, who decides to \"take charge\" (read \"act like a ****\"), and Dad won't (1) own up to it, (2) make gf apologize, (3) take son's side.\n\nScenario 2 : Dad didn't lie about his living situation but gf decided to make up shit to get OP to leave, which was a stupid move. Dad refuses to realize that he is dating a belligerent woman of poor judgement skills and would rather stay with her than make the situation right with his son, who was being disrespected under his own roof, after opening up his place to these two people.\n\nNo matter what, the Dad does not deserve to stay if he chooses ego and crazy gf over son. Let's see if ego and crazy gf can offer him what OP gave him.", "Dad was lying to her. They're both just as stupid as the other. My sister said I was painted as the useless son that dad was stuck with but dad denies he ever said that. It's all just a big mess. Family is a joke", "He had OP's (temporary) permission, so the only audacity involved was the audacity to ask.", "It's all a big mess. I feel like I've been caught up in my dads lies. And Janice just had this crazy idea in her head I was a horrible lazy son who was ruining his life. Family is an actual joke. I'm done with it", "Dad said he owned the house and was making me out to be the useless son. My wee sister says he was telling ppl this to make himself look good", "I can't see it being real. The UK has had a council house shortage since the 80's, I can't see many (if any) councils giving a multi bedroom house to a single male teenager/young adult. The most they would get is a scuzzy single bed flat.", "You're right. I forgot to mention this. He said it was his house. I think it was embarrassing for him being 58 living with son. Shes 40 and clearly a money grabber. I'm betting she will move onto someone new quickly", "Even so, as his fairly new girlfriend with zero stake in the house, she way overstepped her boundaries. If she were my GF and spoke to my kid like that on my behalf, she would have been told to GTFO immediately.", "Glad someone agrees. Dad had lied about who owned the house. Everyone in family has turned their back on me which is why I thought I'd go online to check if I was goin insane", "You're right. It turns out dad was lying to her. I could have reacted better but I let my emotions rule my replies. Mainly wanted some unbiased advice since everyone in family has turned their back on me now. Dad has big influence over them and has turned them all against me. They're all idiots", "Well that sure bit him in the ass! You've definitely done the right thing by throwing them out, don't be guilted into helping him again as he clearly doesn't respect you for it.", "The audacity to ask is a big one. Living in someone else\u2019s house and you ask to bring in an additional body. Idk maybe it\u2019s a cultural difference.", "That\u2019s wild and I\u2019m sorry you had to endure that level of entitlement from someone living in YOUR house. However I\u2019m sure the crazy idea didn\u2019t just spawn in Janice\u2019s head, your father should\u2019ve been told her \u201cthis is not my home, and we gotta be out in 3 months\u201d. \n\nDon\u2019t let her crazy make you feel bad though, you worked hard to have what you do and don\u2019t need any BS in your home. Hold your head high and know you did what was right.", "WOW. This is very relevant information\u2014you should include it in the description of the issue. If anybody would have doubts about whether you should kick them out, that would probably quell them.\n\nYour dad made his own problem by not paying any attention to your deadline and telling an unsustainable lie. Why wouldn't his gf get mad at you? Your own father was sh\\*t talking you and making you the bad guy. Her biggest mistake was believing him.", "Two scammers find out they have nothing. Funny how she brings nothing to the table yet thinks you were the deadbeat. NTA.", "I'm sorry you are in this position and your father sounds toxic. I think Janice is a bit of a mess but I also wonder if she has been manipulated by your father and really thought she was sticking up for him, in a very twisted kind of way. While she was out of line, she is also a bit of a victim of your Dad too", "Not ass, arse. OP is from Edinburgh like me\ud83e\udd23. And arse is so much more satisfying to say , especially with a Scottish accent \ud83d\ude06.", "I can see your point. Not sure if having a father live with the son is also uncommon in your culture. Uncommon in the US, but I can see why the father, having broken that norm, might also ask about his gf, and also why the son would make his acceptance temporary.", "Good point. Will add this in. Reddit character limit forced me to delete a bunch of info", "In my culture we\u2019ve got a saying that translates roughly to \u201cmoochers and dead people stink after 3 days\u201d which is to say we don\u2019t really do extended stays unless the person is sickly or in their 80s and need to be cared for. \n\nBut I guess different strokes for different folks. I just couldn\u2019t envision myself staying with someone that was doing me a favor and asking to add an additional body. In that situation I\u2019d move in with the extra person. Not have them move in with me into a home I don\u2019t own."]}
