I work full time and my husband is retired. Last night my husband decided we'd go visit while Jim's family went out for dinner to celebrate the aunt's birthday. As soon as we got there, it was obvious that Jim wasn't going to last long. Dinner plans were thrown out. The priest came and gave him last rights. I was exhausted and starving after 2 hours. Also, Jim's family was all there and I don't know any of them. I just felt like a stranger barging in on an incredibly personal situation. Nobody made me feel unwelcome, it was just a bad situation all around. \n\nMy husband's ex wife came to visit while I was there and she offered me a ride home. I told my husband I was going with her and he should stay as long as he wants. I didn't want him to worry about me when he should be focused on Jim and his family. I really just wanted to make it easier on him. I was there for 2 hours. My husband stayed until midnight, came home, slept for 5 hours and went back. Jim passed early this morning. My husband was involved as if he was a brother in the family. I'm glad it worked out that way. He's very upset right now but not about me. He appreciates that I gave him the space he needed at the time.\n\nI just feel like I abandoned him at a really vulnerable time when he might have needed me. I wanted to see Jim before he passed but I'm not as close to everyone else. I thought my presence was unnecessary in the face of Jim's imminent death. My husband isn't upset with me right now but he's having trouble processing. He said that he's family, so if I'm with him, I'm family too. I get that but others might not feel that way.

It\u2019s a delicate situation. I suspect your husband just needs time to process this tremendous loss. In time you can explain your reasons, and hopefully he\u2019ll understand better. You did the best you could with an awkward situation.", "NAH Sorry for your loss. Time isn't exactly conclusive to measure friendship and you giving space allows you and your husband the opportunity to grieve together. He got his time with his best friend from childhood, and now he gets to grieve with his best friend and life partner, you.", "NTA. \n\nYou said so yourself that your husband is not upset with you or at you. That's it. No one else's opinions matter here. You gave him the space he needed to spend his last hours with Jim and to grieve. Just support him now while he mourns him. You didn't make this about you.", "NAH. It sounds like this is coming more from your own grief and wish you could more instead of from someone else.", "NTA - Death and loving someone losing a dear loved one is hard to navigate. You both did what you thought was best including communicating. Despite what we see in movies (etc) these life experiences are not perfect (far from it at times). Feel good about what went right which seems to be most of it. Allow him to process and share his experience then together talk about the future and what can be offered to make a future experience more supportive of one another. Best to you and Jim.", "What is the conflict here?  No one has told you you've done anything wrong - it sounds like you're arguing with yourself.", "NTA at all. I likely would have done the same as you. I feel too like I wouldn't want to get in the way of his family saying goodbye etc. I think you're just in a upset/stressed state following all the sadness, try not to worry.", "NTA at all, you did the right thing. From personal experience at a dying family member\u2019s bedside, families likely only want those with close emotional bonds to be there. You can support your husband and his friend\u2019s family in other ways in the days ahead, by helping out at services, etc. So sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Stop second-guessing your decisions. Your initial instincts were correct, and your husband appreciated having the extra time alone with his friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I probably would have stayed close and just went and grabbed food though", "I don\u2019t think so. But you could have sat quietly and just been a physical sign of support. And 20 years is hardly \u201crelatively new\u201d. I think hubby will hopefully appreciate that you have him the time to spend with his friend and the family. But may feel that you could have been there to give him the strength non verbally to be able to do that. \n\nBut, bear in mind, men and women are different. I, as a woman, needed my hubby to stay with me when I heard my mum\u2019s diagnosis. He left to play bowls. He heard the same diagnosis about his dad a few years later and it was only then, when he asked me to stay with him and give him a hug, did he comprehend that he had \u201cabandoned\u201d me. \n\nYour rationale is reasonable. But. Do you think it will be understandable to him, or do you think he would have preferred having you close for moral support?", "NAH", "NTA. You didn\u2019t abandon him. He knew that you knew this was a moment you shouldn\u2019t be part of. This was for the loved ones. He wasn\u2019t the only person in that room and if it was your loved one passing on, you wouldn\u2019t want acquaintances there.", "NTA", "NAH - You've said your husband isn't upset, and you were trying to be respectful in a delicate and tough situation.  Rather it sounds like he needs time to adjust to this huge shift and loss.  As long as you are there to support him in the coming days is the important thing.", "For sharpening his pencil before he wets it.", "NAH\n\nYou all acted with grace and respect at a difficult time. I think maybe you're getting in your own head about a tragic situation and possibly overthinking things. Don't forget to tend to your own grief, too.", "NTA. Explanation may never be needed. Just be there for him as much as possible in the coming days. Give him space as he requests it. Start paying attention Jim\u2019s family and home to see what you can do to help. It\u2019s hard to even know how to ask for help so if you can see a way to be helpful, ask your husband to be sure, and jump in. Food can be really helpful especially if they are hosting other mourners. If there are services ask if they need organizational help. Help with donations and tributes, etc.  best wishes.", "NAH", "Nta. You let him know what your plans were and if he REALLY wanted you to stay he could have asked and when he went back he didnt ask you to rejoin him.  Dont beat yourself up over this.", "NTA\n\nIt's a rough situation. Giving your husband space is a gift beyond measure.\n\nI was notified of a parent's passing and I called my spouse to let her know while she was at work. She literally asked \"do you want me to come home\" and I said \"no. Let me see what is going on so I can get things figured out\". Of course she didn't do that and rushed home and made things much harder all around. I'm still angry 2 years later.\n\nMake sure you communicate with your husband and help where he wants help. (Maybe take care of his chores so he can focus on paying his respects.) \n\nSending positive thoughts to you and your husband.", "My husband is the most generous person. Like give you the shirt off his back. He thinks the best of everyone. I'm not quite there. I just didn't want to intrude with a close friend and his family who have never met me. \n\nI have a ton of feel good stories from Jim. I also have a couple that are wtf that I wouldn't share. We worked it out and became good friends aside from my husband. So I took it more as I'm a good friend who doesn't want to intrude on such a personal thing for their family. I'll be able to share my funny stories. My wtf stories will never be mentioned again.", "Why is the husband the AH here, in your opinion?", "I was really surprised when my husband's ex said that he was lucky to have me. I like her well enough but I never got that feeling from her. I appreciate her even more now.", "It was so weird for me. I only knew Jim and his wife and one friend. I would have been happy to meet Jim's family in better circumstances. My husband might be upset later. I hope he isn't.", "So why is the husband the AH?", "I think you hit a string there. It's not easy to lose a friend and I've lost more than my fair share. I was worried that I was taking myself out of the situation because of my own experiences. I prefer to be alone when I grieve. I could be seen as cold because I internalize my pain and I don't want others to think I don't care. I do, and the more I care the more I isolate myself. \n\nYour comment made me cry. In a good way. Thank you", "Honestly, I hope I pass as well as he did. Diagnosed in December, was fully competent until after Christmas. Went into hospice and passed surrounded by friends and family within 2 days. It was fast but it was compassionate. Awful at this time of year for his wife and family but at least with minimal suffering.", "I did talk to him. I should have driven separately.  We also have dogs at home who need attention. One is at the end of her years and needs a lot of care. I hope she has a few more months ahead of her because she's a huge daddy's girl and losing her will be really tough on both of us. Jim's passing is hard enough right now.", "I watched my own father pass away, so I understand the stress of the situation.\n\nYou were exhausted, starving, and feeling isolated.  You were not family.  You had every right to remove yourself from the vigil for your own mental wellbeing.  Being there at the end is a hard experience that is not for everyone.  I would not have blamed any of my close family for stepping outside if it became too much.\n\nJim's gone.  Your husband isn't.  Honor Jim by supporting his best friend during his grieving process.", "Because it was a typo. My bad", "Why would he be? You left him to talk privately. You didn't intrude. You didn't demand he took you home. You let him do what he needed to do and he didn't have to worry about you. \n\nI cannot for the life of me imagine a more thoughtful approach.", "I dont think anybody thinks that.", "No one is the AH. This sub is Am I The Asshole. It does not mean if OP is NTA, then automatically someone else is.", "You\u2019re welcome, and I\u2019m so sorry for loss. It\u2019s so easy to forget about your own grief when caring for another. While you may find peace in solitude be mindful to still check in with your personal support system, even if it\u2019s just to be sure you don\u2019t turn too inwards.\n\nContinue to give your husband your love and grace but remember to give to yourself as well.", "We can all hope for something as kind and with as little suffering as that. I hope you can all find some peace that he was surrounded by his loved ones.", "Then you should give yourself some grace here. You talked to him, he didn\u2019t object, he came back and slept so it isn\u2019t like you left him the whole day and night. Be gentle with yourself", "Okay, I was curious.  Cuz I didn't think I saw anything that made the husband look bad.  I was wondering if I had missed something in the post or a comment, that he had laid into her for leaving or something.  \ud83e\udd37", "Thanks. I just don't want him to think I'm cold or uncaring. I do care. I'm just the type of person who thinks that everyone needs space to deal with their grief.", "But that's what an NTA vote applies, hence why the NAH (no AHs here) vote was created.  NTA implies the other party is the AH.", "And that is what you gave. If he had asked you to stay, that would have been different. He comforted his friend, I hope he'll turn to you when he's ready to be consoled. \n\nI'm of an age where I've been there. On my first day back at work, I told my colleages that I had lost my father but I was there to work, not to be coddled. I needed to re-centre myself. That was how I felt and it worked.\n\nYou have a funeral to face yet. Again, it's a matter of just being there, when needed, for support. Not patronising or chiding, but letting them remember while helping them to adjust to life without the departed.", "Not always. Sometimes nobody is the ah.   \ud83e\udd70.", "Hence the NAH designation. \ud83d\ude09", "*I just felt like a stranger barging in on an incredibly personal situation*.\n\nI agree with your statement, and would feel the same way.  Dying is not a spectator sport any more than giving birth is.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I think you were right to leave. The family could have considered your presence intrusive.", "NTA.   Just keep supporting your husband.  Maybe throw a meal together to take over for the family.   Try to stay away from lasagna as they will get lots of those (when my uncle passed my aunt got 8 lasagnas)", "NTA at all", "NTA, this situation (as I've been in) has been incredibly important to grieve and say goodbye without worrying about someone else\n\nAlso to bond with the others there at those moments who are of importance in his life.\n\nYou are a stellar person, don't worry about a thing", "NTA\n\nyou did exactly the right thing, you gave him the space", "NTA. You did the right thing, both by accompanying your husband and by leaving when you did. You were supportive at a critical time, then left when his ex offered, giving space to Jim's nearest amd dearest to grieve without a stranger to them.", "NAH", "NAH", "NAH - you tried your best to be supportive and respectful. Just be there for your husband and explain why you left if it comes up. He's going to eventually need you to lean on even if he's being tough currently", "NAH. But I'd take your husband's word for it. I imagine he has a pretty good idea of how they would feel about things like this. It sounds like he's known them for a very long time. I wouldn't sweat it.", "I've been through all this.    I think you did the right thing.", "NTA. As someone who has lost her sibling in a hospice scenario, it\u2019s good that you left. Jim\u2019s family probably wanted their last moments to be fairly private and, while your presence wouldn\u2019t have been a problem, it just feels more comfortable to grieve when there aren\u2019t other people around. Your husband has known the family for years so I\u2019m sure it felt normal for him to be there. \n\nIf your husband isn\u2019t upset with you, don\u2019t worry about it. Be there for him now as he grieves his loss and maybe make a meal for the family if that\u2019s something you\u2019re comfortable with.", "NTA.  Your husband came home, slept for 5 hours and went back.  If he wanted you with him, he should have said so before returning to the hospital, just like he should have said something if he didn't want you to leave with his ex the night before.  Of course he's having trouble processing, but not because you weren't holding his hand every minute.  Stop borrowing trouble, just be there for him now.", "NAH- you did what you could. Just support your husband", "I think how you handle it now that Jim is gone will matter more to your husband than the deathbed vigil ever will. Just keep being loving, let him talk if he needs to, etc- the way you\u2019d support anyone who is grieving. And talk about the good times- it keeps Jim alive for your husband! You\u2019re definitely NTA.", "NTA\nWhat an extremely sad time for you & especially your husband.\nIt sounds like you did all you could conceivably do & treated everyone & the situation with respect and kindness. \nNow your husband will really need you there, when he is sad & grieving. Your support for him now in navigating this grief is what\u2019s really important.", "NAH. My grandfather just passed away two weeks ago in the hospital. I was there visiting the days leading up to his passing and directly after. The whole time my fianc\u00e9 was working and honestly I\u2019m glad that I had the time to be alone with my family and grief together. My family loves my fianc\u00e9 but I know they also really appreciated the space.", "A part of feeling \"new\" is that I haven't met any of Joe's family, and I'm a lot younger than my husband, so I was the youngest person in the room. When his ex showed up, she was greeted warmly because they all knew her. That part doesn't bother me, I would have felt like an outsider whether she had come or not. She knows my husband well enough that she understood that taking me home was the best thing for him. I truly appreciate her for understanding how we both felt in the moment and offered me help that would have been an inconvenience to her.\n\nI did ask my husband if he wanted me to stay and he was good with me going. If he had asked me to stay I would have, but he seemed mostly relieved. He wanted to stay longer than I could. We have an elderly dog at home who needs a lot of care too.", "Jim's wife has a lot of support right now and I expect my husband will be spending some time taking care of her later since we live the closest. He has lots of free time since he's retired and I work swing shifts. \n\nWe've actually discussed this happening before as Joe had some health scares recently. Joe's wife is really scared of facing each day without him and we love her so much it's not out of our reach to help her get through this.", "If no one is the AH, then the verdict should be NAH (No Assholes Here), unless I'm missing something that the husband did.  Not using that destination indicates that the other party is in the wrong or the AH.", "And you are right. \n\nAlso that Jim\u2019s family don\u2019t know you, so it was likely  better for them that you left.  Dying is such a personal and intense time.\n\nAnd extending a strangers sympathy to your husband and all who loved Jim. It so hard to lose those we love."]}
