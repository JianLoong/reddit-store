But the perverted guy he's dating? Fair game.  \n\n\nAlso race is not a good analogy for this situation. Large groups try to paint LGBT individuals *specifically* as perverts and sex offenders. That's not as prevalent with racial issues (not that it doesn't happen, but the intensity is far higher.)", "Homophobes don\u2019t react to every gay person they know by screaming how much they hate them/have an issue with something that doesn\u2019t personally affect them in any way whatsoever.

Looks like she IS homophobic and just refuses to accept OP is actually gay.", "no, it's actually not. your specific justification for why she can't be is, though. I'm not even arguing that she is homophobic but saying that letting *her brother* be around her child is evidence of the contrary is bullshit. plenty of Trumpers and conservatives have their token gay. that still stands true lol", ">Do we know how long ago those comments were made? \n\nNo, we do not. \n\n>They should discuss those comments for sure and she has some explains to do but my view is he also said she has gotten better since he got engaged. So should we judge her on her past actions or present?\n\nAnd I can see your point here. However, I believe a combination of both is appropriate. Someone \"getting better\" can easily just mean that they accept that they can't change someone's choices and they just aren't bringing it up any more. But that's kinda irrelevant because in no comment nor in the post does he say the words \"she's got better since he got engaged\", nor even implied it. In all 4 of his replies, he strongly suggests she still only sees him marrying a woman and that, like I said here, she simply stopped bringing it up. \n\n>Present shows she trusts her fully out gay brother to watch her baby but wasn\u2019t expecting him to sleep on the job.\n\nPresent her shows she still doesn't accept OPs fiance and very likely on the same basis she was constantly trying to get OP to sleep with her friends before he got engaged.", "People likes to feel offended.", "Still being pushed hard by magatards", "You think a 12-year-old asked and badgered her 16-year-old brother about which of her friends he wanted to screw?", "Can you explain your logic here?

She is mindful enough to adjust her behavior out of respect for you.\n\nI'm bi, raised in the Catholic church and schools too.

A lot of people come to accept and embrace inclusivity as a result of personally getting to know someone in a minority group.
