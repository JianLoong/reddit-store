I'm the only one that wants from in house that has the qualifications for the position. They want to hire from in house. The campus has 50 plus buildings between the main and satellite campuses.

May the best man win!", ">I flat out told him that what hes doing is a dick move.\n\nNope, whack. He's applying to a job, he's entitled to apply for the job, he's entitled to take the job if it's offered to him. You're not entitled to the job just because you want it. \n\n>After alittle digging I found out that brother called my temporary supervisor the night before him and i texted and said things like I'm not capable of the job.\n\nThis is also super shitty though. \n\nSo I guess ESH", "The assistant director already guaranteed me the job. They rather hire from in house. There's minimal training on the inner workings side of it. The university is huge. Over 50 buildings between the main and satellite campuses.", "If the brother isn\u2019t careful with his calling, it can easily become a slander case if he\u2019s spreading false information that can impact fair consideration for a job.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m pretty sure his move to do that is a possible reason why he won\u2019t get the job because he\u2019s starting drama in a place he doesn\u2019t work at anymore. NTA", "I forgot to mention. The assistant director already wants to put into the role. The way I approached him with confidence basically secured me the job. I'm already in house and know the inner workings. Rarely do carpenters wanna leave the protection of the union to work directly for the university.  With the union the workers are basically untouchable. The only way he'd be considered is if I back out of it.", "> The way I approached him with confidence basically secured me the job\n\nSo then why is it a dick move for him to apply? \n\nI get that it's a dick move that he's going behind your back and saying shit that isn't true about your work or whatever. But your original post makes it sound like you told him it was a dick move right off the bat before you knew he was doing that, when he just said he was applying for the same position. \n\nIf you've got it in the bag, it's not a dick move for him to apply. (But it wouldn't be a dick move for him to apply even if you didn't have it in the bag.) \n\nSaying that it's a dick move just because he applied to the same position as you is not cool, IMO.", "The dick move I was really referring too was how he got me in and left in three weeks. Alot of people were questioning me about potentially leaving. Yes I do have it in the bag.", "> he got me in and left in three weeks\n\nHe got you a job. Why does that mean he's obligated to stay working there? Usually someone getting you a job is, like, a pretty cool move. He didn't have to do that. He also isn't obligated to stay at a job he doesn't want to stay at. I fail to see how it's a dick move. \n\n>Alot of people were questioning me about potentially leaving.\n\nI mean, he could have just not gotten you the job before he left. And then instead of being questioned about potentially leaving you just wouldn't have this job. Right? Still seems like on the net, your bro hooked you up."]}
