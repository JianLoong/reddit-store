Maybe once every few months if he has a gf he is trying to impress. \n\nSo my daughters are mixed race. I am very particular about how they look most of the time. If we go out in public I make sure they look good. I make sure their hair is done and they have very nice dresses. 99% of the time if someone sees my girls they look magazine worthy. \n\nHowever they are 3 years old and you just don't put a pretty dress on 3 year olds when they are going to the park to play. \n\nI had taken them to get their pictures made for Christmas and after we were going to the park because they deserved a reward for being so good. So I changed them into some really warm rompers and coats, they also had hats and gloves. They were not nasty or anything but playing in dresses in the winter is just a no. They needed warm play clothes. \n\nMy ex called and asked what we were doing and I told him we were headed to the park. He wanted to see the girls so I told him to meet us at the park. I assumed he would be alone and I kind of assumed he wouldnt show up at all because it was very out of character for him. \n\nHe showed up with a woman and a child. He immediately got angry with me because the girls weren't wearing pretty clothes they were wearing winter play clothes. He also complained that one of the girl's hair looked a little messy. She's 3 and messes with her hair of course it's messy. Also she was wearing a winter hat so you could barely see her hair anyway. \n\nI told him no I wasn't going to put them back in their dresses and I wasn't going to keep fixing her hair just for her to take it down again. It's stressful for her and me. She was happily playing and did not care at all. \n\nAnyway he is very angry and I'm not sure if I was being the A hole or not. The woman he came with apologized to me for his behavior but I just told her not to worry about it.\n\nEdit to add he has always been particular about outward appearances. He is always clean shaven and meticulous about his hair and clothing. Nothing can be even slightly dirty or disheveled. So I wasn't that surprised he immediately was upset about their appearances.\n\nEdit#2 bc I just got back on and saw this ? A couple of times. So why it matters that my children are mixed race?\n\n He threatened to take the girls along with his mom because he didn't think I would be able to care for their hair and specific needs that were different than mine. He also screamed at me for 3 hours once for not doing enough to learn even though I had my best friend and her mom teaching me and the girls weren't even born yet. This is just a continuation of him not believing I can take care of them. It happens pretty often if anything is remotely unkempt or if they look ashy at all. Mostly it's just pictures I put on Facebook of whatever we are doing, he will get angry for any slight he believes I made and call. I do my best to make sure my girls do not look unkempt without hurting their self esteem.", "created_utc": 1669872226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9fgb8/aita_for_not_changing_my_childrens_outfits/", "score": 1650, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
