So I changed them into some really warm rompers and coats, they also had hats and gloves. They were not nasty or anything but playing in dresses in the winter is just a no. They needed warm play clothes. \n\nMy ex called and asked what we were doing and I told him we were headed to the park. He wanted to see the girls so I told him to meet us at the park. I assumed he would be alone and I kind of assumed he wouldnt show up at all because it was very out of character for him. \n\nHe showed up with a woman and a child. He immediately got angry with me because the girls weren't wearing pretty clothes they were wearing winter play clothes. He also complained that one of the girl's hair looked a little messy.

Also she was wearing a winter hat so you could barely see her hair anyway. \n\nI told him no I wasn't going to put them back in their dresses and I wasn't going to keep fixing her hair just for her to take it down again. It's stressful for her and me. She was happily playing and did not care at all. \n\nAnyway he is very angry and I'm not sure if I was being the A hole or not. The woman he came with apologized to me for his behavior but I just told her not to worry about it.\n\nEdit to add he has always been particular about outward appearances.

Kids should play in what is weather appropriate and comfortable. Why would you put them in fancy dresses to ruin at the park anyway?", "NTA. You\u2019re nicer then I am. I would\u2019ve said \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about it. He only cares about these things whenever he has a new girlfriend he wants to impress \u2014 this is no shade to you, it\u2019s just how he is when he pops up every couple of months.\u201d\n\nBut I\u2019m a petty person \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA Lol so this woman saw a red flag. Good. He reminds me of \u201csleeping with the enemy\u201d.", "NTA", "NTA. You said the kids are biracial and daddy asshole is obsessed with appearances. I'm surprised he even interacts with them as minimally as he does, and only to impress someone who has a kid this time and losses his mind when the girls are being toddlers. With this woman who also has a toddler. Jesus, he's gonna give anyone a complex. Take him for more support if you can.", "He threw a tantrum over toddlers wearing appropriate clothing whilr playing at a park?\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s sad that the new girlfriend is already apologizing for his behavior. I hope she catches a clue and mopes out of there. NTA", "NTA - he can dress them however he pleases when he has them but trying to shame you for dressing your kids appropriately for the activity they were doing is ridiculous", ">father is supposed to get them every other weekend but he rarely ever gets them\n\nI hope you been tracking all of this down. This will be important if you ever have to go to trial for what ever BS he wants to pull later. You better be getting child support. I would just log everything he does that doesn't line up with stuff. You will thank your past self later for doing all of this.  \n\n\nNTA... its clear he doesn't understand children..  GL to his new GF.", "Take the deadbeat to court.", "The deadbeat is all uppity and upset about how the children he never sees look? That's rich. NTA. It is your misfortune in life that this is the man who is fated to be the father of your children.", "NTA at all. This is 100% the smart and correct thing to do. \n\nBuuuut, in the future if they ever get really picky with clothes and decide they hate pants (like i did, my mom could not get me into pants i HATED them till about 3rd grade) and will only wear dresses, fleece lined leggings and a good pair of boots are everything in the winter. Would wear those with my Eddie Bauer fleece, princess dress (a pink floofy tulle monstrosity lol), and bright yellow rainboots.\n\nCourse if there's snow on the ground they still wont really be enough, but if youre just in a place where it only hits 50 at the coldest during the day they should work really well. And it's a decent compromise if they really don't want pants for some reason that day.", "NTA \n\nThey are 3, and this is all age appropriate in terms of your choices. You sound like a wonderful mom who is still working on the programming from your ex. It's just as well for your girls that he chooses to stay away as he would give them a complex.", "I have watched my Brother & SiL cope with twin girls, and it is tough. They have aged ten years in the last five.   \n\n\nIf you're a single mum raising triplets, frankly you deserve a round of applause for just getting them to wear clothes at all - getting them to look perfect is a mid-range miracle.", "It's a good thing your girls are being raised by you. Sounds like by your ex's obsession with outwards appearances they could develop a complex about their looks if he had too much influence.", "Definately NTA. You are doing what any normal parent would do, dresss teh kids to the weather and situation. If your husband is not stepping up to the plate, why listen to him? Tell him to go home and read a few books on raising three  3 year olds. \n\nYou are doing great!!!", "NTA. What a weird asshole your ex is. I can only hope that his new gf, who apologized for his behavior, sees through it and makes a run for the hills. If you don't have a court order around custody, visitation, and child support, now is the time to get one. As they get older and can wear nice clothes for longer periods, I'd worry he's going to start demanding that they visit all dressed up so that he can get a lot of attention from women or just people in general. They're kids, not show ponies ffs.", "It's a shame he's not as meticulous about his co parenting as he is about his appearance. \nOp is NTA", "NTA and I\u2019m glad the woman he was with recognized his childish behavior. Sounds like this guy is prioritizing their appearance over their safety and comfort. It\u2019s too cold to play outside without winter clothes. And who cares if kid hair is a bit messy while playing at a park lol? I\u2019m sure they looked fine and even if they didn\u2019t, who cares? They\u2019re kids having fun playing outside. They don\u2019t always need to look perfect and it\u2019s probably not good for their self-esteem to hear their dad throwing a tantrum about them looking \u201cmessy\u201d", "Does this ratio seem correct (purely collected  from half-paying attention).\n\nThere are 20 white women having babies with black males than any black woman having a baby with white guy?", "ESH. This obsession with their appearance terrifies me on their behalf.", "He sounds like my grandpa, who only ever wanted to see us when he had a girlfriend who was family oriented and he could be like \u201clook, me too!\u201d", "His appearance \u2018must be perfect\u2019 mindset will be very damaging to your daughters. I think I would evaluate whether anything about him would be a positive influence on them, document every missed visitation, every comment he makes about their appearance with a note of witnesses, date and time\u2026then go for full custody with supervised visits so his commentary can also be under supervision. I assume he gets copies of the formal pictures. The petty part of my brain would send him only pictures of them playing\u2026in play clothes\u2026in the dirt. NTA", "Please start documenting when he does not take them on his designated time and start saying no to him seeing them on your time. Document everything that has transpired, including how generous you have been in access. If you don't have a formal custody agreement, get one.", "Lmao that is the bare minimum required by law, paying child support does not a good father make! Screw him, Mom you\u2019re doing an amazing job raising triplets as essentially a single parent!", "But the woman seemed to appreciate him showing his ass. She has a kid, so it was probably a series of red flags.", "It was mostly muddy water, so they only looked dipped, not slathered! I just stripped them off on our deck...they were cloth diapered, so pretty droopy butts! And yes, wonderful. \n\nThey also played on the kitchen floor with shaving cream in the winter. By the time we all got done, the lower cabinets and the floor were squeaky clean and smelled minty. So did the kids.  Double score! !", "that's my oldest- by 3 minutes- niece. it's better now that she's 7 but i told her to take her dress off so she could play in the water at a playground in NYC once. turned around to help her sister. turned back and she was naked.\n\nyou just had to laugh.", "Tell him that, when he actualy behaves like a responsible father, he will have a say on how to dress the girls. Since he only apprears from time to time... he just should shut up. Girls aren't only cute and well dressed when they are wearing dresses.\n\nEdit to add: stop dressing them up to look like magazine dolls. They are as cute with nice shorts and t-shirst, or anything else. Your ex is horrible to be so bend on image,  butyou are doing the same.", "No, being an absentee father is what makes him look bad. \n\nDon't listen to this shallow, selfish man. Your children are not his accessories to parade around when it suits him to bolster his image.", "No,  it makes him look bad that he can't even be assed to see his kids once a week.  Compared to that,  nothing can make him look good.", "He makes himself look bad by being a shitty father. And it sounds like his gf picked up on that, so it's definitely not just you. I bet he's been talking himself up as father of the year to her and she saw right through it.", "Please don't tell him to dress them like he wants in his time. He will. And they will be unhappy and hurt, because he will be angry at them for messing their picture perfect outfits etc. We've seen so many people here who's been hurt by parents like this...", "The difference, gauging how he treats his ex and how the woman responded.", "If it were me, I would have been tempted to tell the lady that he was with to pay attention,", "I would have been tempted to tell the lady that he was with to pay attention, because he is showing her who & what he really is, and her kids would not be exempt."]}
