Maybe once every few months if he has a gf he is trying to impress. \n\nSo my daughters are mixed race. I am very particular about how they look most of the time. If we go out in public I make sure they look good. I make sure their hair is done and they have very nice dresses. 99% of the time if someone sees my girls they look magazine worthy. \n\nHowever they are 3 years old and you just don't put a pretty dress on 3 year olds when they are going to the park to play. \n\nI had taken them to get their pictures made for Christmas and after we were going to the park because they deserved a reward for being so good. So I changed them into some really warm rompers and coats, they also had hats and gloves. They were not nasty or anything but playing in dresses in the winter is just a no. They needed warm play clothes. \n\nMy ex called and asked what we were doing and I told him we were headed to the park. He wanted to see the girls so I told him to meet us at the park. I assumed he would be alone and I kind of assumed he wouldnt show up at all because it was very out of character for him. \n\nHe showed up with a woman and a child. He immediately got angry with me because the girls weren't wearing pretty clothes they were wearing winter play clothes. He also complained that one of the girl's hair looked a little messy. She's 3 and messes with her hair of course it's messy. Also she was wearing a winter hat so you could barely see her hair anyway. \n\nI told him no I wasn't going to put them back in their dresses and I wasn't going to keep fixing her hair just for her to take it down again. It's stressful for her and me. She was happily playing and did not care at all. \n\nAnyway he is very angry and I'm not sure if I was being the A hole or not. The woman he came with apologized to me for his behavior but I just told her not to worry about it.\n\nEdit to add he has always been particular about outward appearances. He is always clean shaven and meticulous about his hair and clothing. Nothing can be even slightly dirty or disheveled. So I wasn't that surprised he immediately was upset about their appearances.", "created_utc": 1669872226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9fgb8/aita_for_not_changing_my_childrens_outfits/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd remind him that they have two parents, and he's welcome to be involved with dressing them and doing their hair any time he likes. I hope this asshole is paying child support.", "You're NTA but their father sure is.", "NTA they are children, then need to be warm in winter, and they are dressed appropriately for the circumstances. Telling the girls they should be cold to look prettier would be pretty messed up.", "NTA \n\nAll parents of the world know that kids wear comfortable clothes to play at the park. You are a good parent! I can see why he is an ex.", "NTA - This man is barely in the girls lives and he thinks he gets a say in their outfits? Smh. You\u2019re dressing them appropriately for the weather and for playing. Why would you prioritise their appearance over their well being?? And honestly bringing a woman and a child with him without telling you is so toxic.", "NTA, he's obviously just showboating his daughters which is gross but ultimately failed when he couldn't keep up the perfect parent facade in front of his newest prey who is a Mother and saw right through it.", "Effing pathetic. You\u2019re NTA! He villainises you for taking care of your child. Yes yes, OFCOURSE it\u2019s a good idea to risk my children getting hypothermia to impress a man who doesn\u2019t care about them. Whoever that man is, he is a wretch and a leech. He only wishes to impress based off of living, breathing beings with feelings that care and cherish.

You are trying to make sure your kids are dressed appropriately for their environment. I would never put a child in a dress during the winter! That exposes them to a higher risk of getting sick.
