That is a major red flag. I\u2019m usually against the whole dump them/divorce them quick trigger that this sub has, but you need to do some serious soul searching about this woman.

Explain that you want an education and a job so you can get her what you think she is really worth. Keep telling her that if she brings it up. At some point she will realise she has three options: settle for a cheaper ring, wait until you are working in your field and can save money, find a partner with a better economy. \nThis way you may lose her, but honestly, this is such a rubbish thing to leave a guy over, I can't imagine why you would fight over this.\n\nAnd I know engagement rings are culturally a big deal some places, but I would rather have a craft room in our co-owned house. Now that is worth an argument!", "The ring my boyfriend is gonna be getting for me, isnt even $500. It shouldnt be about the price, but the promise, the love, the thought behind it. I'll never understand anyone who has a \"minimum\" for a ring - the only reason mine isnt just a $50 ring, is because i want it to be able to last the wear and tear of my daily life, which costs a bit (quality usually lasts longer). I know he loves me, and he wants to build a life with me - and thats enough. \n\nSo no - NTA.", "NTA and you may want to seriously reconsider this engagement. \n\n\"It better be worth more than $2k\" like what, if it isn't, she'll say \"no\"?

I don't understand how women can place such a monetary value on a ring. If my husband had proposed with a $50 ring I would still be over the moon. Not only that, but where I am from you can get a VERY decent ring for $2000. \n\nThe biggest red flag though is the guilt trip. \"Get me what ever you think I am worth\" that is such a problematic approach to this. Why would you want to get her anything if she is going to make you go into more debt just because she wants a pricier ring? If I were you I would sit down and have a conversation about these expectations.", "NTA\n\nMost people I know who get married/engaged in med school/residency don't have pricey rings.\n\nQuite often, they just get wedding bands and the wife gets \"a rock\" (if she wants one) for the 10th Anniversary after the husband is established.\n\nI have concerns about your intended because she expects a significant amount of money to be spent on and engagement ring while you are still in school.  This doesn't sound like  a reasonable intelligent person or someone who will stick around for the \"better or ***for worse\"*** part of marriage.  It sounds like she wants a rock from her \"doctor fiancee\" to flash around.\n\nThink long and hard before you propose to this woman.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA but maybe reconsider this relationship, she\u2019s manipulative and greedy.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a trap!\n\nBut in all seriousness, you\u2019re def NTA but your GF is.

Maybe now a $100 silver ring is what you can afford. When you are more established in a career, more expensive tokens of love can be given.

I would be appalled at the idea of my husband spending so much on a band of metal with a shiny rock. Plenty of people spend thousands on a wedding ring and realize they hate each other a year into it. And plenty of others live long, happy lives together yet can't afford even the slightest of bands. You each have different ideas of what this means, and you need to address it before actually getting engaged. Do you really want to marry someone who says this to you, or are you going through this because you've already invested time and think it's the only option.", "NTA. Now she is trying to guilt you into buying something you can\u2019t afford. She sounds more interested in her ring than in your financial stability. You might want to rethink proposing to her.", "NTA, you don\u2019t buy someone a ring equally to the value of what they are worth. Finding a life partner is invaluable and no ring can match that value.\n\nIf your partner feels that the rings value is more important than your commitment to her, then sadly she is not the one.\n\nThis is one of the times when life is pushing you towards a junction in your life.\n\nOption one, propose to someone who measures you not on you as a person but how much money you can throw at them.\n\nOption two, thank them profusely for showing you early on what a big mistake you would be making and move on.", "NTA. Fun fact, the more a couple spends on rings/wedding, the more likely they are to break up. 2k will get you a perfectly nice ring and you can always buy a nicer one later. I told my gf \"I don't care if you propose with a ringpop, I just want to spend my life with you.\" You don't need an overpriced shiny rock to show how much you love someone.", "NTA\n\nThis doesn't stop with a ring. This is your life. If she won't accept a $2000 ring, think about what she'll expect the wedding to be like, or the house, or the car.

My boyfriend and I are talking marriage and rings as well. I told him that I don't need an expensive ring and had only one request for it -arthritis friendly as I have a bone disease that  causes swelling- it's not the ring itself that's important,  it's what it symbolizes!", "NTA my husband picked out a ring he thought I'd like and it cost \u00a3169.  I adore it, partly because the ring is very me but because he chose out and thought about what I like.  He could have given me a paper ring and I would have been delighted. I was marrying the man, not the ring.  \n\nI would be questioning if she was with you because you're a med student and likely to earn decently after you're qualified.", "Damn, she is *that* shallow ? \n\nI would say yes to my bf even if he decided to propose with a paper ring. A marriage isn\u2019t about the shiny sparkly diamond, it\u2019s about the person you love and want to spend your life with. \n\nYou can find better than that.\n\nNTA", "obvious NTA. The part that should matter is the love and getting engaged, not the ring itself.\n\nI want to offer some ideas about your would-be fiancee's reaction that I haven't seen covered in other comments.\n\nYes, she could just be a stuck-up snob that sees you as a future gravy train and doesn't care about you outside of money.\n\nBut that comment? about buying her whatever you think she's worth? that stuck out to me, it sounds like an attachment wound poking out. I don't know her background or your background but I came up with a few ideas. \n\nMaybe her mom got a really cheap engagement ring from a guy who eventually left her, and warned her daughter about being with a man who wouldn't shell out for an \"expensive enough\" ring or something. Like it was a warning sign of things not working out or the guy not taking marriage seriously. An expensive ring is security.\n\nMaybe her family is super rich, and was given expensive things as a replacement for genuine love. So she grew up thinking how much money is spent on her is literally how much someone loves her. Because that's the only thing she was shown.\n\nMaybe her family is super rich, and she's completely out of touch with how much money people really make and what things are worth. Maybe the women in her life did that whole \"well you know, Kevin bought ME an 18 karat, blah blah blah\" thing? and it's an insecure, competitive issue?\n\nNone of these reasons excuse her shallowness, but perhaps offer some insight. I read a bit of hurt in there for her. You won't know until you ask her though, and someone you want to spend the rest of your life with *should* be able to tell you why they care so much about the sticker price of a ring.", "NTA ONLY 2000$?! It's not only, it's a huge amount of money. This thing with \"engagement rings need to be 3x monthly income of the groom\" was because if the groom would leave the bride after engagement but before the marriage she will have some kind of compensation and also because other men wouldn't choose her to marry her. Woman where completely dependent from ther husbands.\nToday she should be able to make her own living and shouldn't need the insurance of the engagement ring. Furthermore it's not s problem to find another \"provider\" if she was already engaged or had Sex.\n\nPersonally: i wouldn't wear such an expensive ring in my daily life. I would be too afraid to use it. But I would like to have some quality. A friend of mine got an 50\u20ac engagement ring which \"stone\" was loose after a few weeks.", "When husband and I were talking about marriage I gave him a vague description of rings I liked, with the clear instructions not to spend too much- if it was too expensive I\u2019d just be worried about damaging it! He got me the perfect ring but (in my opinion) spent too much- think at the exchange rates at the time it would\u2019ve been around $800. \n\nIf your girlfriend is trying to dictate the minimum a ring should cost, her priorities are in the wrong place. \n\nNTA.", "Nta. To me rings don't mean much, it's the relationship that matters. My husband had a ring made, he was on very modest wages. I think it cost \u00a3250? My wedding ring was cheaper still. He upgraded the ring a decade later which was unnecessary, but he really wanted to do it.\n\n$2000 is a lot of money to me.", "NTA. Rings are only physical symbol of love and devotion. If she loves you, she should be willing to settle even for less, taken your current financial situation.", "NTA - appreciating a ring purely on monetary value is superficial and selfish. I'd be concerned about her spending habits in the future if she's only interested in how much her engagement ring costs. \n\nWould she think the same if you shopped around, maybe purchased stones online and had one made that would cost $5 000 in a store, but cost you $2 000 for example, or does she want to tell people that it cost $5 000?\n\nAlso, I love jewellery, but wouldn't mind if someone proposed to me with a ring that costs less than the ones I already have, I wouldn't even care if it was a pretty little one in the style I like that only cost a couple of hundred. It's about the meaning behind it.", "NTA the diamond wedding ring thing is literally just a scam made up by De Beers to make a fortune, look it up. Of she was a non entitled intelligent woman she'd prefer a nice smaller ring and the rest of the money toward the deposit for a house.", "NTA. The trappings of modern marriage are just things. Very expensive things. Your financial situation is difficult right now and will be for a while although, as a doctor (I assume) it will get better eventually. Your girlfriend not understanding this and \"demanding\" an expensive piece of carbon seems like a big red flag. Tying what she believes you think she is \"worth\" to this rock is another red flag. From the sounds of it, you both understand that you are already engaged. Why would a proposal and ring change any of that? Seems a bit silly to me since all of that is just to fulfill some invented fantasy that society (and a lot of companies) have convinced people is necessary.\n\nI remember hearing about a study that found a clear, inverse relationship between the amount spent on the wedding (and all the related stuff) and the length of the marriage. Sounds like maybe your girlfriend is wanting to be on the expensive end of that graph.", "NTA \n\nWhat she is worth...\n\nWell have her tell you what she is worth and why...\n\nMy bf spoils me rotten, IMO\nHe thinks he's just treat me decently\n\nIt's all about values, and you should have talked about this kind of thing before you consider putting a ring on it.", "I genuinely have no idea the cost of my engagement ring.

Not sure how well this person would stand by you in residency if they\u2019re already getting hung up on the ring.  \n\nMarrying someone in med school is a completely different path than marrying a fellow employed 20 or 30something.  Other people are going to have money and free time while you have neither until you finish residency/fellowship in half a decade.  \n\nIf you\u2019re planning on getting married you should be having the \u201cfinancial goals\u201d talk before you\u2019re buying a ring.  And divorce in residency is NOT fun.", "NTA. My husband was struggling for money when he proposed. He bought me a \u00a330 ring. He knows I love purple and amethyst so ensured it had that in it. Its 9k gold, cubic zirconia and amethyst. We were engaged in 2006, married in 2013. I still wear it dearly and treasure it, despite the fact that it is now missing a cubic zirconia. Imo an engagement ring is about choosing something you know they will like, not how much money you spend on it!", "NTA. Like not at all.\n If my partner wants to propose to me it could be a 200\u20ac ring I wouldn't mind.\nThe whole \" Wedding/Engagement rings should be worth amount XYZ\" comes from a time where this kind of jewelry was also used as a mean of insurance.\nMan broke off the Engagement? Sell the ring.\nHusband died? You might have had little savings but you can sell wedding/Engagement ring to live off a little.\nThis is long passed.

Honestly...it's something I usually feel separates a girl from a woman. A woman doesn't care and realizes it's a symbol and often prefers the practical aspect of it. A girl wants the money value so she can talk about how much it was.\n\nMy husband and I looked at rings together so he knew what style I preferred etc. We were on a cruise and in one of the Diamond International stores where they really try to tell you \"it's so much cheaper since it's duty free\" and there was a ring I really liked they kept trying to sell me. If I'd said this is the one I know he would've bought it but I also knew we could find a cheaper one back in Canada. And we did - by half.

Is she paying most of the bills and picking up most of the chores? My friends in med school and residency were broke & stretched thin on time and honestly weren't the best partners to their significant others. \n\nSo maybe it's more about recognizing her sacrifice with the ring? Have you talked to her about the financial situation & negotiated about maybe upgrading later or starting with a really nice wedding band and getting \"the rock\" later? \n\nAlso engagement & wedding rings are important to a lot of people and some people don't want to ever upgrade or change them so that might not even work. I paid for my engagement ring, wedding band, and anniversary band because he couldn't afford what I wanted. I'm not a *material gurl* but this was important to me and something I have to wear everyday for the rest of my life & I'm sentimental AF so there's no upgrading in my future. \n\nYou should really talk about the \"spend what you think I'm worth\" comment with her - I think there's way more going on than just the cost of the engagement ring.

And don\u2019t cheap on the metal, especially if you are willing to spend 2k. \n\nIf she isn\u2019t willing to have a lab grown diamond, I would straight tell her she is being selfish and should expect to wait until you are making enough money to support yourself before expecting a proposal.", "When you know your partner can't afford the ring and still you ask for it, on top of that saying typical manipulative dialogues, she doesn't deserve even a temporary ring. Entitled brats shouldn't get anything.", "I'm curious: is it a thing wearing the engagement ring forever or just a personal preference?\n\nIn my country, an engagement ring isn't necessary, just nice to have and you usually put it off at your wedding or shortly before and that's it. I don't get that perspective some fianc\u00e9es have and as it is told in american movies. It's \"Look, I am no longer on the market\" not \"Look, my exact worth is equivalent to its price tag!\"\n\nFor the answer: NTA. She might be if she is serious.", "If they do go this route the temporary ring could be used on trips and such so the real one isn\u2019t at risk of being lost, broken etc.", "Exactly. If I was him I would have left her just for that. My husband knows I don\u2019t need an expensive ring to be happy because he designed my ring with love, but I was making a suggestion in case he wants to continue the relationship. Either way it\u2019s up to op what he wants to do about the situation.", "I personally love rings & wore them all the time even before I got engaged so I don\u2019t take my engagement ring off. Everyone I know never take theirs off as a personal preference, if they decide to keep it on then they get a matching band to go with their ring on their wedding day :)"]}
