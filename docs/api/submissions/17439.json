However, you purchased that particular seat for a very long flight. If she wanted a seat that reclined she should have reserved it.", "NTA.

BUY THE SEAT YOU WANT.", "NTA You paid for a seat that reclines, why would you give up what you paid for?", "NTA. You payed for your seat. Why should you cater to someone you don\u2019t know just because she has a kid with her? If it were an emergency, I\u2019d understand where she was coming from, but that doesn\u2019t seem like the case", "Lol, NTA. This is classic entitled parent behaviour. Her needs are no more important than yours.", "Of course you're NTA. Just because she was using her child for a sympathy prop doesn't mean you're obligated to give up something you paid for; if she wanted a more comfortable and expensive seat, she should have booked one instead of counting on her ability to guilt someone into giving up his seat.", "NTA.  She knows how to pay for the seat she wants.  She isn't entitled to yours.", "NTA. This seems to have become a real problem lately, people just expecting others to switch seats with them. I generally pick a particular seat for a particular reason and don't want to switch. Sorry she got mad at you.", "NTA. Everyone in the flight should sit where they are ticketed. If someone wants a special arrangement they can certainly arrange it well before the flight by purchasing the seat they want.", "NTA. She could have paid for reclining seat.", "NTA that\u2019s why you pay extra to sit where you want.  Having a kid doesn\u2019t entitle you to special treatment", "NTA.  What's up with all these people wanting to kick people out of their seats.", "NTA.", "NTA - Entitled people on planes can feel free to go sit back in the terminal.", "NTA\n\nShe has every opportunity to prebook a seat. \n\nAnd everything except the back row reclines.", "Do you think you should have treated her as an EQUAL or as mother with a baby?\n\nIt's your call Dude.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with her asking to switch seats in case you wanted to do a random act of kindness, but she should\u2019ve also been prepared to hear \u201cno\u201d from someone who understandably might not want to give up the seat they specifically chose and paid for.", "That doesn\u2019t always work\n\n*this sub is such a toxic hive mind.

The seats that recline on international flights often mean the ones that *fully* recline, which cost significantly more money than they ones that just go back 2-4 inches like regular airline seats.

If I ask someone nicely, they have the right to refuse. I\u2019m not entitled to someone else\u2019s prepaid seat either.", "Agreed. Mom here too. I work hard to arrange my situation w my kids ahead of time. This includes seating and time off requests from work.", "NTA you are never an asshole for not giving up your seat on an airplane.

The only ones I\u2019m aware of that don\u2019t, are the seats that are against a bulkhead. Pretty easy not to choose those when reserving.

Her lack of planning is not your problem.", "Why can't the 'mother with a baby' plan better and accordingly purchase the seat of her liking?

So even on the bus or subway OP wouldn't be the AH.", "Wait - why would OP be an AH if this were a bus or subway?", "Because being on a bus, standing, while carrying a toddler can be dangerous.", "Thata true but I've had many friends with kids book seats together.  Oops! Flight got changed and they randomly assigned your 3 year old to sit by themselves.  Still wouldn't be OPs problem, more of an airline problem but I suspect that's what that comment was referring to.", "NTA - If she wanted a reclining seat, she should have paid for one.  \n\n\nPeople continually think that their children are your responsibility.  Glad you stood your ground.  \n\n\nShe was TAH for being mad at you.  (She's not TAH for asking, that's still fine, but as soon as you declined, she should have been gracious.)", "But that's her child, not the OP.  \n\n\nOther people's children are not your responisibility.  I hate that parents contiually place their decisions on the shoulders of others.", "Someone else just pointed out the lady asked to switch seats so said lady already had a seat. OP NTA and same would apply on the bus"]}
