Let's not mince words here. You're asking your daughter to subsidize the trip, either because you cannot afford two cabins or because you are too cheap to pay for two cabins. Let's ask a few rhetorical questions\u2014if your daughter pays for part of the trip, does she get a veto on activities? Does she get her choice of accommodations? Does she have to share a cabin with her siblings? (We all know the answers to these questions are \"no,\" \"no,\" and \"yes.\") \n\nLook, it's your money and you and your wife can spend it however you'd like. But if you're paying for some of your children and not all of your children on what is supposed to be a family vacation, that's the very definition of favoritism. I don't blame your daughter for opting out of this trip. Nor would I blame her for opting out of other activities going forward.", "YTA for planning a vacation that excludes one of your children in the first place, which you did when you looked into 4 person cabins for a 5 person family. It isn\u2019t really a full family vacation. You have the right to go on a cruise and take whoever you want, but your daughter also has a right to be upset that she is seemingly an afterthought in family vacation plans. Are you close to your eldest child? Did you know a surprise cruise would not be reasonably feasible with her job and place in life right now?", "YTA so it\u2019s a \u201cfamily\u201dtrip for your wife and two dependent children. Also, who are you kidding? Her cabin would be your other two kids cabin. Your trying to get her to pay to house your other kids for the trip. Expect your daughter to not feel like a member of your family after this boneheaded move. If you can\u2019t afford another cabin, you should have been planning a different trip you can afford for the whole family.", "INFO - would the extra cabin be exclusively hers or would she have to share with her siblings? Also, if she pays her own way, does she get a say in the trip\u2019s itinerary or will she have to follow the plans you\u2019ve already made?", "YTA. You don't get to have this both ways, if you expect your daughter to participate in these things like an adult. Then you need to treat her like an adult - that means looping her into the planning with sufficient notice", ">\tI (m) am planning a family cruise with my wife, 15(m), 12(f) and 20(f) children.\n\nNo you aren\u2019t.  You are planning it for you, your wife, and your 15 and 12 year old.\n\n>\tI told my daughter that if she wanted to join us, she would need to pay for her share as we would need 2 cabins to fit all 5 of us. \n\nINFO: Is her share the entire second cabin, or one fifth the cost of two cabins?  If she is expected to buy an entire second cabin, then she can choose to have it entire to herself as that is what she paid for.  If you make her pay one fifth, then you are at least subsidizing her cost and can put the other kids in there.  That might be reasonable if she has a full time job and wants to go with you.\n\nEither way, she gets to decide if your chosen vacation is where she wants to spend her money and time off.  She also gets to decide if she wants to visit you on weekends or holidays or if she wants to do you any favors or if she wants to see you at all.  Y T A if you resent her for acting like an independent adult once you have made it clear the family no longer includes her for holidays.  After all, it is so much easier without the third wheel kid.", "YTA and your wife . it\u2019s a family trip , you\u2019re going to pay for everyone but her and then go without your daughter because  she\u2019s too poor to afford it ?", "Yta. It's not a family trip but extortion.", "I hope your 20yr old remembers this when you're old and need help with things. Maybe she'll put you in a REAL nice home... YTA", "YTA. That is your own child. Surely the youngest can sleep on the couch.", "YTA. If you\u2019re planning a family trip, AND you expect your working adult child to pay for her share, then your plans need to work for your adult child\u2019s budget too. \nEither plan a holiday that she can afford, or just admit that this isn\u2019t a \u201cfamily\u201d holiday and you don\u2019t care if she can\u2019t come.", "So this is the first trip of this kind, so you have never taken your oldest on a cruise, but now taking the younger ones?  Of course, YTA.\n\nYou should have picked a vacation everyone could go on.", "YTA. Its obviously not a family vacation if you're taking care of it for everyone but one child. If the 15yo had a job would you make them pay their own way?", "YTA. My family of now adult children would be miserable having a family vacation that one of them can't afford. They would pitch in to help cover expenses for the ones who couldn't afford it because they LOVE each other and family vacations are about TIME TOGETHER. \n\nSounds like you don't care if your kids are close when they grow up. I don't get it.", "YTA How oblivious are you to think you're NOT the asshole in this situation? Are you actually here thinking people will think your daughter is the asshole?!\n\nShe's BARELY an adult, she's not making great money. If you expected her to pay for family trips you should have told her a long time ago. And OF COURSE it's not a family trip to her if she has to pay. Plus it's a cruise, meaning to get a cabin to herself she'd have to pay for MULTIPLE PEOPLE just to have a room to herself. Or, wait, were you going to make her pay for a full room then ask her to let one or both of the kids also stay in there? Seems like something someone like you would pull.\n\nShe can't afford it and isn't going. And....You're mad about that part as well? This is just absurd.", "Info: What exactly is her share? Are you making her pay for a whole cabin herself? Or just a 5th of the cost of the trip? Are you planning on having on cabin to yourself and your wife with the 3 kids in the other?", "INFO: Why are you expecting your 20 year old (you know that adult as you keep pointing out) to share a room that SHE will be paying for, with her underage siblings? \n\nHow pathetic are you? If she was paying for her room and her vacation, she doesn\u2019t have to share her space. \n\nBecause you\u2019re not paying right? And she\u2019s a working, functioning, independent adult who doesn\u2019t need to sacrifice the space she\u2019s paying for, right?", "YTA. Be prepared to accept she will not go on many (or if at all any) trips with you in the future. Specifically looking for a four-person cabin for a five-person family? Sounds like you didn't want her there in the first place.", "So what is the problem with her staying home? Were you expecting her to watch your 12YO?  Share a cabin with the younger kids, so she would have to pay for the priviledge?", "YTA - that's not a family trip. That's a trip with your two favorite kids. The logical solution would be to get two cabins, one for you and your wife and one for your three kids to share. If you can't afford that, don't call it a family trip.", "YTA this is not a \u201cfamily vacation\u201d at all. Making a 20 year old either pay or stay home is beyond messed up. She is barely an adult and I highly doubt your wife actually believes she can possibly make enough to afford that. It sounds like your wife doesn\u2019t like her to begin with. If she thinks it\u2019s so easy to afford then why doesn\u2019t your wife pay for her own accommodation?", "YTA.\n\nIf it\u2019s a family vacation include all the family, additionally you could book her a solo cabin at a much cheaper cost than another large cabin, and if she wanted an upgrade then she should pay but otherwise cover her basic fare.", "There was a similar post to this a couple weeks back and the verdict was YTA there too.", "YTA. I say this as someone who has a family with mostly adult kids and who are expected to pay their share of holidays (admittedly we don\u2019t go as far as cruises!). It\u2019s fine to set that rule, but if you do then you need to a. Accept that the answer may well be no I can\u2019t afford it I\u2019m not coming, b.

You are excluding her, and honestly parents like you just make me so sad for your children- they don\u2019t stop being your kids when they turn 18. And obviously you could pay for her to come and are just choosing not to just because of some weird hang up you have. What\u2019s more important? Money, or your relationship with your daughter?

You have 3 kids and a wife! You\u2018re showing favoritism!", "YTA. How are you even confused on this point.", "YTA x 100", "YTA - I\u2019m all for adult children being given the option to opt out of family activities and holidays. I also agree with the sentiment that if they are financially independent, they should be asked to contribute to some activities.\n\nHOWEVER, that contribution should be proportional to their age and income, not their equal share of the actual costs. It should take into account that you\u2019ve chosen the activity, not them. Your role as a parent of a young adult is to help them set themselves up for success, not fleece them of their income the second they start earning money. This means you might expect them to contribute rent and board if living at home, or pay towards activities, but you wouldn\u2019t ever charge these things at market rate. And if your adult child wants to participate in a family holiday, the amount you ask them to contribute should never be so much that it would prevent them from attending. They won\u2019t want to participate forever, as parents part of your financial obligation is ensuring that family activities can continue to happen for as long as every child wants to participate.\n\nIn the case of a family cruise, with a 20yo child attending who is likely to be asked to room with (and take care of) her younger siblings, I would suggest that a fair way of talking with her would be \u201cWe really want you to come on our family trip, and we appreciate that you\u2019re an adult and might want your own space. Your options are to either pay $X for your own private room, or to bunk in with your two siblings and we will pay for your accommodation. We\u2019re getting the XYZ package that covers accommodation, meals and the following activities (list), if you\u2019d like to upgrade meals, have drinks, or spend some time alone doing other activities not on that list, you will have to pay for those things yourself.\u201d\n\nIf you still genuinely can\u2019t afford to pay for all 5 family members to go on this cruise with that sort of mentality, then you need to pick a different family holiday.", "YTA\nWhen my sister and I go out to dinner with my father, he pays.
