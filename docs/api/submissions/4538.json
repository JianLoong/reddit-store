What you did was definitely following the spirit of the rule and I can imagine not wanting to go back to your room every few minutes if you're dealing with a fussy baby. \n\nSo for me, definitely NTA. You and your husband need to come to an agreement about visiting his family because you could be breast feeding for a lot longer (if you so choose) or what if you have more children? Now, I AM a bit of an asshole. So, I would totally suggest telling your husband you no longer feel comfort visiting because FIL is sexualizing your breast. I mean, why else would they have a problem? Clearly he sees them and is immediately turned on and that makes MIL uncomfortable. Knowing that about him, how could you possibly feel comfortable visiting because what if he's imagining you naked the entire time? I would probably say that with a big dose of sarcasm, but the point stands. Some hills aren't worth dying on, for whatever reason (I blame hippy parents), this is one that I would personally die on.

You agreed to put yourself in a situation that was likely to upset you (for good reason) and you knowingly broke a house rule, however obnoxious it was.\n\nI'd suggest you thread the needle here by apologizing for breaking the house rule and leaving it at that.  Then never visit them again.  And when they visit your house to see their son, you can consider what sort of bizarre house rule you can set for them.  Cuz, politeness and pettiness can be a fun combination when you absolutely must deal with AHs.", "NTA. Your FIL sounds really judgemental and it's not his business to judge why you \"bother to breastfeed\". \n\nBreastfeeding the baby is super important and it's not reasonable to impose a rule whereby you have to walk upstairs to do it.

You were totally right to leave and frankly I don't think you or your child should ever go back--ever.  If your husband wants to continue contact with these AHs, that's on him.

He should have never agreed to these conditions. At this age my baby was eating constantly. If you\u2019re being forced to hide in a back room for hours to FEED your child, then the answer should be no: \u201csorry mom and dad, your conditions are unreasonable so we won\u2019t be able to visit any time soon. Hope you like the pictures.\u201d", "I had a son before with my ex - I've done this mama shit before lol. Little dude would rock up and undress me. I would love to see my FILs face when his little grandson starts it lmao", "They have one kid right now. One is hard enough. If they plan on having more, they will need the help. It truly takes a village.", "Because they suggested it. The very idea that they would even suggest their grandchild be fed on a toilet is disgusting.  And if someone had a rule that I can't comfortably feed my child in their house without hiding like I'm doing something shameful would have me walking out immediately.  \n\nNothing about breastfeeding is inappropriate, shameful, disgusting. The idea people think that says a lot about them.  If FIL is bothered by the idea he can see a bit of her breast, he's the problem. \n\nAnd you are correct, I wouldn't even go there. Ever. They would never see their grandchildren with rules like that.  \n\nAnd yes I focused on the bathroom because it's fucking ignorant and disgusting they even suggested it as an option. \n\nAnd I would happily be an asshole to their faces about it.", "They suggested she sit in the bathroom to feed baby. As long as she was hiding in shame seemed to be the point.", "Maybe OP wasn't allowed to do it in the bedroom either. Sounds like that could be one of the rules, but idk  \n\n\nedit: I didn't know as it turns out. There were indeed guestrooms to use.", ">If someone does not want to see it in their own house, that IS their right.\n\nYou are correct that people have the right to be regressive idiots afraid of a perfectly normal, healthy, wholesome, life-giving activity.\n\nPeople who feel like that shouldn't have breastfeeding people over. \n\n>Yes, you have to change a baby's diaper,\n\nThat's a shitty false equivalency, and you're shitty for using it.\n\nGo change your attitude, it stinks.", "You're absolutely right. They're going to be constantly meddling and criticizing, doing what they can to make OP feel bad. OP is going to have a lot of misery with this family, including her useless husband.", "They weren't homeless. They went to visit family and for the grandparents to meet the baby. Why should they be made uncomfortable on purpose?", "Their suggestion makes them AHs for sure, but she knew that about them. Nothing new there. She accepted to go under those terms. She could have gone to the guest bedroom like she had before. She didn\u2019t want to, for her own reasons, knowing that if she gets caught there will be trouble, and that\u2019s what happened. \n\nThe world is not a perfect place unfortunately\u2026 if you associate with pigs don\u2019t act surprised when you are dragged in the mud.", "She said \"I have to nurse in the bathroom or guest bedroom\" which isn't awesome but is better than it just being the loo.", "The post explicitly says the guest bedroom was an option.", "Because she agreed to it", "Yes, all true. But it takes time to learn to say no when you are trying to keep the peace. Once I learned to stand my ground and say no to things my life got 100% better. The people who think I'm an asshole for no longer catering to them are the real ahs.  Op just needs to learn but she's already in a vulnerable state with a baby, being shamed, and guilt tripped. Husband needs to step in and remove them from the situation. \n\nIt highly offends me that anyone breastfeeding would be asked to not because it makes someone else uncomfortable. \n\nUsually men who look at women as sex objects and women who have husband's who look at women as sex objects are the usual suspects. I've NEVER heard a single good reason why a baby should be fed in hiding ever. And no \"it makes me uncomfortable\" doesn't qualify. The babies needs come before theirs and THEY can leave the room if it bothers them. When I see something I don't like, I remove myself from the situation. \n\nFIL can go sit in his bedroom until she's done if he can't get over his problem. But you're correct, I would leave. Lol I would never honor this for one second.", "Thanks I must have missed that.
