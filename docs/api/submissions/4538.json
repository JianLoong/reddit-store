I\u2019d not let them see the baby for the duration of your breastfeeding - maybe that\u2019ll teach them to not me such arseholes and to not judge you, and not to impose their stupid rules on you.

What you did was definitely following the spirit of the rule and I can imagine not wanting to go back to your room every few minutes if you're dealing with a fussy baby. \n\nSo for me, definitely NTA. You and your husband need to come to an agreement about visiting his family because you could be breast feeding for a lot longer (if you so choose) or what if you have more children? Now, I AM a bit of an asshole. So, I would totally suggest telling your husband you no longer feel comfort visiting because FIL is sexualizing your breast. I mean, why else would they have a problem? Clearly he sees them and is immediately turned on and that makes MIL uncomfortable. Knowing that about him, how could you possibly feel comfortable visiting because what if he's imagining you naked the entire time? I would probably say that with a big dose of sarcasm, but the point stands. Some hills aren't worth dying on, for whatever reason (I blame hippy parents), this is one that I would personally die on. Very dramatically.", "You knew the rules before you went to their home. It's not your place to judge what makes someone else uncomfortable no matter how stupid it might seem.

Breastfeeding is natural, especially around the family (in laws are family too) this shouldn't be an issue.", "ESH  Yes, your in-laws have the right to make their own house rules.  But the rules are shitty and your in-laws are rude, judgmental people.\n\nYour H is somewhat of an AH for not standing up for you more strongly, but at least he doesn't seem overly angry about the situation.\n\nYour behavior is part of this mess too.  You agreed to put yourself in a situation that was likely to upset you (for good reason) and you knowingly broke a house rule, however obnoxious it was.\n\nI'd suggest you thread the needle here by apologizing for breaking the house rule and leaving it at that.  Then never visit them again.  And when they visit your house to see their son, you can consider what sort of bizarre house rule you can set for them.  Cuz, politeness and pettiness can be a fun combination when you absolutely must deal with AHs.", "NTA. Your FIL sounds really judgemental and it's not his business to judge why you \"bother to breastfeed\". \n\nBreastfeeding the baby is super important and it's not reasonable to impose a rule whereby you have to walk upstairs to do it. It's not as if you deliberately did it in front of him anyway; it was an accident that he discovered you. If it offends him, that's 100% his issue, *not* yours.", "NTA. Your husband, however, sounds like one. I agree with your mom. The fact that he didn't defend you for FEEDING YOUR BABY, like any normal person would and should do, he sided with his bonkers parents.", "NTA.\n\nYou have to feed your baby and do what is best for them. The dad can chill out. \n\nI guess it is his house. If I specifically asked someone not to do something in my house, I might be a little annoyed too. But, I mean as them eating my last hot pocket or blasting loud music late at night. Not taking care of a fucking infant. \n\nThey should think long and hard about if they want their grandchild in their life, because after some shit like that, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be bringing my child around them for a hot minute.

You were totally right to leave and frankly I don't think you or your child should ever go back--ever.  If your husband wants to continue contact with these AHs, that's on him.

However, you also have the right to leave when those household rules make your life miserable.\n\nI get it that some older folks aren't comfortable with a woman breastfeeding around them and a lot of them believe that formula is just as good. They don't understand how often a young baby will want to nurse and by forcing you to go elsewhere, they're isolating you. This was a chance for them to be supportive of you and their grandbaby and they failed. Your husband failed too at being supportive.", "YTA - their house their rules and you knew that.

When I fed my kids, I was really surprised how breast feeding divides opinion. I fed mine in restaurants, round friend\u2019s houses and with family.

I mean, I guess you could accomodate them when possible, but sometimes it's not easy. But the fact they make so much drama over it, that they question your choice to breastfeed, that they yell and insult you for doing something completely natural, it's just wrong.

Ever!\n\nPersonally, at the dinner table I would start telling them that I feel uncomfortable and disgusted and nauseated at the sight of them eating their meal.

You are literally feeding a baby and it is natural.  If you need to feed your baby in public that is what you do.", "You're NTA, but I can make you feel better with a funny FIL story. \n\nPicture the scene, my sons 5th birthday, spiderman themed! I'm sat feeding my baby girl (around 7 months), I spot my FIL and dad having a chat by the pizza bar, FIL facing me and dad's back to me. \n\nJUST as FIL decides to look my way, my darling girl flings herself off my breast, exposing my FIL to full funbag. He covers his eyes and yells I'm sorry, I scramble to grab my boob, yelling I'm sorry. My husband starts laughing, which sets off baby girl even though she has no idea what happened.

You had no idea how inconvenient it was really going to be until you got there.  As a new mother, you are already anxious about feeding and caring for your baby. You have now learned that breastfeeding and visiting your in-laws are not compatible, so any time you have a breastfed infant, do not visit your in-laws.  \n\nYelling at you was not the answer to anything.

You feed baby wherever you are. Your in laws and hubby are AH.  \nKudos to your mom for being amazing!", "NTA.  Their house rules are cruel and ignorant.  \n\nIf I had been treated like that, the mere sight of my MIL and FIL\u2019s faces would make me uncomfortable.

She doesn't suck, she just has bad taste in men.", "LOL centuries!", "I don't cover up and never have. Due to supply and latch issues I watch him to make sure he's eating well, and we're trying to wean him off the bottle unless absolutely necessary (and I would of still had to pump while he was eating, landing me locked away anyway).", "To be honest I didn't even think about covering up lol. I've never done it in the past.", "But of course you are NTA for leaving. I would have done the same thing.", "You felt bad because they act like what you did was wrong, therefore you're second guessing yourself. It's not wrong.

You and your husband agreeing on and enforcing boundaries will be key. \n\nIf you\u2019re lucky their interference will be sporadic and infrequent. Good luck!", "Her son didn't need to starve, she could have gone to the guest room", "Plus she even said they sometimes use formula, so it wasn't out of the question to do that. They should have been more supportive of her, but at least they were honest about their rules.", "Why should she have to spend her whole holiday in a guest room because an adult man is scared of tits?", "Because of supply issues, if she doesn't supply she might not be able to breast feed for very long. In laws, and the husband are bullies and all round TA", "This might be my favourite comment ever \ud83d\ude2d thank you for this lmao", "If supply issues are bad then you can pump before hand. She said the reason she fed the baby was because they were hungry. In laws are AH, but I'm guessing they are just old fashioned and genuinely aren't comfortable with it, that does make them AH, but not bullies."]}
