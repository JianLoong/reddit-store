What you did was definitely following the spirit of the rule and I can imagine not wanting to go back to your room every few minutes if you're dealing with a fussy baby. \n\nSo for me, definitely NTA. You and your husband need to come to an agreement about visiting his family because you could be breast feeding for a lot longer (if you so choose) or what if you have more children? Now, I AM a bit of an asshole. So, I would totally suggest telling your husband you no longer feel comfort visiting because FIL is sexualizing your breast. I mean, why else would they have a problem? Clearly he sees them and is immediately turned on and that makes MIL uncomfortable. Knowing that about him, how could you possibly feel comfortable visiting because what if he's imagining you naked the entire time? I would probably say that with a big dose of sarcasm, but the point stands. Some hills aren't worth dying on, for whatever reason (I blame hippy parents), this is one that I would personally die on.

You agreed to put yourself in a situation that was likely to upset you (for good reason) and you knowingly broke a house rule, however obnoxious it was.\n\nI'd suggest you thread the needle here by apologizing for breaking the house rule and leaving it at that.  Then never visit them again.  And when they visit your house to see their son, you can consider what sort of bizarre house rule you can set for them.  Cuz, politeness and pettiness can be a fun combination when you absolutely must deal with AHs.", "NTA. Your FIL sounds really judgemental and it's not his business to judge why you \"bother to breastfeed\". \n\nBreastfeeding the baby is super important and it's not reasonable to impose a rule whereby you have to walk upstairs to do it.

In any other context, it wouldn't be okay to have your breasts out, so I don't see why using them for their naturally intended purpose makes a difference. \n\nIt's like if a man whipped out his penis to take a leak (let's just assume he had somewhere reasonable for the urine to go in a public space for some reason). He's using it for its naturally intended purpose, completely nonsexually. But I'm sure the people in the space would have a problem with it, and that problem isn't limited to \"pee is gross\" but certainly includes \"I didn't consent to seeing your dick, at all, even in a nonsexual context.\" \n\nBreasts and penises are different, obviously; they serve different functions. When people claim breasts are not a sexual organ, are they saying that an adult touching someone's breast (outside of a doctor's office) is a nonsexual touch? Are they saying it's okay for people to look at or touch their breasts as long as they claim they don't mean it sexually? Because you can claim a penis isn't a sexual organ unless you're currently using it for sexual purposes in the same way, but that doesn't make it okay for guys to get it out anytime they want. \n\nI know that raising children is difficult and time consuming and draining. I know that asking people to wear a cover is just another thing on top of a mountain of things to worry about and deal with. I don't mean to be insensitive to that.

OP, understandably, is distressed and feeling pressurised into treating her baby in a less than optimal way because of her ILs incredibly old-fashioned rule. To deal with this, she moved out early and that is ***their*** consequence for their inconsiderate rule.

Both sides get to set boundaries. \n\nWhat I see happening if she didn\u2019t agree is MIL/FIL not allowing them to visit; thus biting their noses off to spite their faces (Aka trash taking itself out), or allowing it and making snide comments the whole time, at which point OP/husband would have grounds to complain.

You don\u2019t have to agree with it which is why you\nHave the choice to not go.", "There wasn't food or drink allowed upstairs, so I had to dash dow regardless.", "All I said is that op agreed? I didn't say \"oh it's very easy to be a breastfeeding mother who has to go upstairs multiple times\"", "So OP knowingly put herself in a shitty situation to please others, and she\u2019s upset that the situation is as shitty as she imagined?", "I think he's clusterfeeding again lol so it was horrific (note, he was not cluster feeding when we arrived).", "Don\u2019t give me that, you can totally play on your phone.\n\nAnyways, you shouldn\u2019t have gone.  You shouldn\u2019t have agreed to the rule and broken it.  You should\u2019ve just gone to the bedroom.  You knew how often your baby gets hungry.  Your inlaws are assholes, you\u2019re an asshole, everyone is an asshole.  My only point was that the bedroom being upstairs is far from being the \u201cunreasonable\u201d part of this whole scenario.  Even if the bedroom was right off the living room, you\u2019d still be alone in there most of the time.", "She was free to not go and free to leave. They informed her of their house rules prior to the event, and she agreed. She still decided to disrespect it.", "She absolutely was. So it's good to hear you agree. Great talk.", "Hopefully, she learned to decline visiting her in-laws in the future. Their rule is degrading and disgusting.", "Not sure you can really call it a boundary, when the boundary is as insane as \u201cevery time you put anything in your mouth, it has to be done behind a closed door, even if we are eating or drinking in common spaces\u201d. It\u2019s not so much a \u201cboundary\u201d as it is controlling how a baby eats.  \n\nI hope OP now knows to never go there again. Still doesn\u2019t make OP an AH or make the ILs \u201cboundary\u201d OK.", "Not allowing water upstairs is stupid. There's faucets up there I'm sure.\n\nYour husband is inconsiderate. Staying there is a huge hassle and it sounds like he does nothing for either of you.\n\nMy wife would literally never let me hear the end of it if I acted this way.", "No *water?* Honestly you should edit this in to your post if you haven\u2019t yet \u2014 that and the lack of chair. These show it\u2019s really not about rEsPeCt or whatever, they\u2019re treating you as a second class citizen. I\u2019m so sorry OP \ud83d\ude22", "I can't. He gets distracted and will cry and whine on me if I don't have both my hands on him. \n\nHe started clusterfeeding part way through the stay; which I was not expecting. It was not meant to happen but my lactation consultant told me its probably because I wasn't feeding him on demand the way I had been previously.", ">\tDon\u2019t give me that, you can totally play on your phone.\n\nJeez dude, there\u2019s no need to be an ass about it. Unless you\u2019re OP or her baby how would you know how baby responds to mom being on her phone? Take a deep breath or something.", "She was not free to leave until her mother rescued her. She said her husband wouldn't drive her home.", "There\u2019s an expectation that you\u2019re going to visit family over the holidays. It\u2019s not the same as him pressuring her. You\u2019re reading too much into this. \n\nHusband is stuck between two people who are being unreasonable.  His parents for creating this situation with judgment and silly rules, and his wife, for not making a very minor concession by going to the guest bedroom for feedings. Honestly, if it was that uncomfortable, you\u2019d think she would\u2019ve welcome the opportunity to excuse herself and be alone. But no, she was upset by this rule, and chose to disregard it, and chose to be the spark that lit the powder keg.", "I\u2019m not saying I disagree, AT ALL! As a bf\u2019ing mom, when in my own home and someone wanted to visit, I let them know in no uncertain terms was I excusing myself to feed my child elsewhere, so if seeing nature at work and seeing why we have these body parts offends, they may want to wait a good long while! Lol \n\nIt will never cease to amaze the capacity in which partial nudity is acceptable. I don\u2019t know if these ILs are strongly religious, prudes, have had some issues or infidelity threats in the past, whatever\u2026. And I don\u2019t like defending such a crazy viewpoint. But I believe she was in the wrong. I wouldn\u2019t have gone, knowing those crazy demands. Maybe start a new tradition of seeing her family a week early and spending Christmas quietly at home. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nETA: I\u2019m actually very body self conscious, so for me to just tell someone they have to be okay with seeing a normally private part of me so exposed, that should speak volumes.", "You may think it's disgusting and degrading, but at the end of the day, it's still their rule and she needs to abide by it or she can GTFO. It's honestly that simple, don't know why you're making it more complicated than it should be.", "Oh I agree. I would never have set foot in that house. But op did, and I feel like she had zero support. Being forced to hide and isolate to feed your baby IS an unreasonable request for someone\u2019s house.  I\u2019d say we aren\u2019t welcome here, good bye.", "I can\u2019t find any of that in the post.

It\u2019s your position that because I have not breast-fed a baby myself, despite being an experienced father of a large family, that I cannot possibly understand how much of an inconvenience it is. OK\u2026 except that you were expecting this new father of one child to understand this thing that you say it\u2019s impossible for a man to understand.\n\nYou\u2019re as bad as all the women in this scenario\u2026 setting impossible expectations and then getting upset when people can\u2019t meet them.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
