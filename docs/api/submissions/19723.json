{"id": 19723, "submission_id": "149th54", "title": "AITA for refusing to share or donate to my good friend\u2019s fundraiser?", "selftext": "We\u2019re all mid-30s here.\n\nMy very close friends (a married couple) have a young child who has some serious health issues. Insurance covers most of the things he needs, although my friends go above and beyond to make sure he has anything and everything that could possibly give him a better shot at living a long healthy life, so they probably spend more money on him than you\u2019d spend on a typical healthy child. \n\nThey make 6 figures and live in a large house in a good neighborhood. They recently took out a loan to put an edition on their house to add a new playroom for him (nothing to do with his conditions, just to give him bonus space to hang out). Shortly after they took out this loan, their insurance denied their request for something they felt their son really needed. It was $8,000 so they got a new credit card (with an introductory 0% APR) and bought it for him.  \n\nSeveral days later, my friend announced that they\u2019d made a crowdfunding page to help pay off the credit card faster. On the page itself, she just explained his conditions and why he needs this thing, but no details about their financial situation. To me, she said they need help because they wouldn\u2019t have taken on the project with their house if they\u2019d known insurance was going to deny them this, they shouldn\u2019t have to pay for this themselves, and this will really slow down their plan to pay off their debt. She asked me to share their fundraiser to my friends (I have a lot more followers then her). I politely declined, and she was furious. She accused me of judging them for needing help, and of not loving their son. \n\nI do love their son very much, but I suppose I am judging her for thinking she needs help. I view crowdfunding as something for people who are desperate, who really need charity. My friends are people who live and eat well, have clothes to wear and a roof over their head, who don\u2019t think twice about ordering a new toy or game or kitchen gadget from Amazon, and who have willingly taken on tens of thousands of dollars in debt for something they definitely don\u2019t need. I know the extra $8,000 was not something they\u2019d planned for, but it\u2019s also not going to break them. They make double what I make and probably triple what half my social media friends make. I don\u2019t want to share their fundraiser to a bunch of people who don\u2019t really know them, and who might think that my friends are in a desperate situation. I think it\u2019s a better use of money to donate to people who really are in bad shape, whose electric is about to be shut off, who don\u2019t know where their next meal is going to come from, that kind of thing.\n\nMy friends are not speaking to me at the moment, so I\u2019m asking Reddit: AITA?", "created_utc": 1686805955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149th54/aita_for_refusing_to_share_or_donate_to_my_good/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Still not your problem.", "Huge NTA.\n\nThis isn't a situation where a surpsie 8 grand bill may make or break a family.\n\nThis family has demonstrated a carelessness with money, and the best course of action they can take right now is to consult with financial advisor and make an attempt to consolidate their debt before it gets out of control.\n\nThey're so used to throwing money out the window that they feel a certain indignity when life decides to throw them a financial curveball. Instead of taking a second look into their finances and coming up with a better game plan, they feel it's the responsibility of anyone but them to pay.\n\nIf people endorse this and bail them out of a situation that they refuse to help themselves in, their financial situation will only get worse, and an 8000 dollar credit bill will be the least of their worries.\n\nEdit: she's also manipulating you emotionally by using her child to guilt trip you when the answer to her problems is to live a slightly less lavish lifestyle for a little bit.

You\u2019re the one making the connection to the renovation and acting like they\u2019re doing the fundraiser for the playroom and lying about it. They are your friends with a sick child and openly making this kind of judgement on their finances will have a deep, negative impact on your relationship.\n\nThat said, you do know about their financial situation and they really are assholes for using their son\u2019s illness as a hook to help pay off debt that they both unnecessarily incurred and can reasonably afford when there are people that are really struggling. It\u2019s totally fair that you didn\u2019t want to share with your followers, but you should have kept the reasoning to yourself. \n\nIf you have a time machine, tell them (without any explanation or judgement) that you\u2019re not comfortable sharing on your social media, but that you will be happy to contribute to their fundraiser and hope their son is doing well.

You sound awfully judgy and not like a good friend.  While not required, you could have shared it or helped out with a small donation. People can choose whether or not to donate.", "YTA. You don't really know what anyone's financial situation is like no matter how close a friend they are. And past spending doesn't do anything for them now that they've been hit with an unforeseen bill. You don't have to share it, but not donating? Really?", "NTA. I think a lot of people would judge them for asking for donations, given their financial situations and choices. I have had a sick child as well so I can understand desperation in doing everything you can, but they seem to have the financial means already.", "YTA, you are so judgmental it\u2019s painful to read.  You don\u2019t get to pass judgment on what people spend their money on, especially parents of a sick child.  Insurance rarely covers 100% of everything, you are way too involved in their personal finances and overall a very unpleasant person.", "NTA - you\u2019re never wrong for not giving someone money, for any reason. How often have they given you money to pay off your debts?", "NTA \n\nYour reasons don't matter at all. She asked a question. You gave an answer. Full stop. She's acting like she gets to demand you do things and you have no say in it. That isn't true.\n\nYour friendship is probably over. Not because you said no, but because she wants to act like her question was a command.", "NTA. They don't need help. They just want lower their debt quicker ... that is a wish of all ppl with debt. Not a need.\n\nAlso I think they're are becoming irresponsible. Sure, the kid has healh issues. But they blow money on something their son doesn't need instead of saving money for future needs.", "NTA\n\nWhat you post on your social media is completely up to you. You don't even owe them an explanation why you don't want to post the fundraiser.\n\nAccusing you of not loving their son was uncalled for and seems to me like an attempt to guilt-trip you.", "NTA.", "NTA.

People who live in large homes and have high salaries don\u2019t need charity.", "I think it makes you look like more of an asshole if you refuse to share and don\u2019t give a reason. It\u2019s kind of like subscribing to a YouTube channel. Doing it helps the channel and it doesn\u2019t hurt you. So I don\u2019t know why a friend would refuse to help out another friend when it doesn\u2019t cost anything, unless they gave some reasons.", "Oh no, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing it for the playroom. I know they\u2019re doing it to pay off this new credit card, which they opened just for his medical expense, and I do agree with them that their son needs this thing. My point is just that they took on $80,000 in debt without hesitation and this is a drop in the bucket in comparison. It\u2019s not that $8,000 is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back; it\u2019s more that they don\u2019t think they should have to pay for this, so if insurance won\u2019t do it, then they\u2019ll try to make their family, friends, and strangers do it instead? Which seems kind of crazy to me, because sure, in a perfect world, insurance would cover it and it would not be their responsibility to pay for it\u2026 but it also most certainly would not be the responsibility of a bunch of random internet strangers to pay for it, either. \n\nI\u2019d actually be much more comfortable donating to it myself than sharing it\u2026 I guess my title is misleading, because I didn\u2019t flat-out refuse to donate to it. She directly sent the link to me and asked me to share it with my followers, and my reply was just that I didn\u2019t want to do that because it would throw off my normal content and people might think my sharing of it meant it was a much more desperate situation than it actually was\u2026 and that\u2019s what started all this drama. I didn\u2019t explicitly tell her I wouldn\u2019t donate (but I haven\u2019t donated).", "That\u2019s a shitty reason. It is not a friendship if it is conditional.", "I don't even understand this expectation that OP MUST love their friend's kid. \n\nI believe that love is an emotion that should not be demanded, and nor should be expected for people who have only just been born and you don't know yet.", "In the same vein, we don't know anything about OP's financial situation. So making a judgement based on not donating seems a bit unfair.", "If you think she's so wrong you can make a donation in her name.", "Wait are you saying they took out 80K in debt for medical treatment and that's why they started a donation page?"]}
