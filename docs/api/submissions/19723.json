Insurance covers most of the things he needs, although my friends go above and beyond to make sure he has anything and everything that could possibly give him a better shot at living a long healthy life, so they probably spend more money on him than you\u2019d spend on a typical healthy child. \n\nThey make 6 figures and live in a large house in a good neighborhood. They recently took out a loan to put an edition on their house to add a new playroom for him (nothing to do with his conditions, just to give him bonus space to hang out). Shortly after they took out this loan, their insurance denied their request for something they felt their son really needed. It was $8,000 so they got a new credit card (with an introductory 0% APR) and bought it for him.  \n\nSeveral days later, my friend announced that they\u2019d made a crowdfunding page to help pay off the credit card faster. On the page itself, she just explained his conditions and why he needs this thing, but no details about their financial situation. To me, she said they need help because they wouldn\u2019t have taken on the project with their house if they\u2019d known insurance was going to deny them this, they shouldn\u2019t have to pay for this themselves, and this will really slow down their plan to pay off their debt. She asked me to share their fundraiser to my friends (I have a lot more followers then her). I politely declined, and she was furious. She accused me of judging them for needing help, and of not loving their son. \n\nI do love their son very much, but I suppose I am judging her for thinking she needs help. I view crowdfunding as something for people who are desperate, who really need charity. My friends are people who live and eat well, have clothes to wear and a roof over their head, who don\u2019t think twice about ordering a new toy or game or kitchen gadget from Amazon, and who have willingly taken on tens of thousands of dollars in debt for something they definitely don\u2019t need. I know the extra $8,000 was not something they\u2019d planned for, but it\u2019s also not going to break them. They make double what I make and probably triple what half my social media friends make. I don\u2019t want to share their fundraiser to a bunch of people who don\u2019t really know them, and who might think that my friends are in a desperate situation. I think it\u2019s a better use of money to donate to people who really are in bad shape, whose electric is about to be shut off, who don\u2019t know where their next meal is going to come from, that kind of thing.\n\nMy friends are not speaking to me at the moment, so I\u2019m asking Reddit: AITA?", "created_utc": 1686805955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149th54/aita_for_refusing_to_share_or_donate_to_my_good/", "score": 367, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And past spending doesn't do anything for them now that they've been hit with an unforeseen bill. You don't have to share it, but not donating? Really?", "NTA. I think a lot of people would judge them for asking for donations, given their financial situations and choices. I have had a sick child as well so I can understand desperation in doing everything you can, but they seem to have the financial means already.", "YTA, you are so judgmental it\u2019s painful to read.  You don\u2019t get to pass judgment on what people spend their money on, especially parents of a sick child.  Insurance rarely covers 100% of everything, you are way too involved in their personal finances and overall a very unpleasant person.", "NTA - you\u2019re never wrong for not giving someone money, for any reason. How often have they given you money to pay off your debts?", "NTA \n\nYour reasons don't matter at all. She asked a question. You gave an answer. Full stop. She's acting like she gets to demand you do things and you have no say in it. That isn't true.\n\nYour friendship is probably over. Not because you said no, but because she wants to act like her question was a command.", "NTA. They don't need help. They just want lower their debt quicker ... that is a wish of all ppl with debt. Not a need.\n\nAlso I think they're are becoming irresponsible. Sure, the kid has healh issues. But they blow money on something their son doesn't need instead of saving money for future needs.", "NTA\n\nWhat you post on your social media is completely up to you.

People who live in large homes and have high salaries don\u2019t need charity.", "I think it makes you look like more of an asshole if you refuse to share and don\u2019t give a reason. It\u2019s kind of like subscribing to a YouTube channel. Doing it helps the channel and it doesn\u2019t hurt you. So I don\u2019t know why a friend would refuse to help out another friend when it doesn\u2019t cost anything, unless they gave some reasons.", "Oh no, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing it for the playroom. I know they\u2019re doing it to pay off this new credit card, which they opened just for his medical expense, and I do agree with them that their son needs this thing. My point is just that they took on $80,000 in debt without hesitation and this is a drop in the bucket in comparison. It\u2019s not that $8,000 is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back; it\u2019s more that they don\u2019t think they should have to pay for this, so if insurance won\u2019t do it, then they\u2019ll try to make their family, friends, and strangers do it instead? Which seems kind of crazy to me, because sure, in a perfect world, insurance would cover it and it would not be their responsibility to pay for it\u2026 but it also most certainly would not be the responsibility of a bunch of random internet strangers to pay for it, either. \n\nI\u2019d actually be much more comfortable donating to it myself than sharing it\u2026 I guess my title is misleading, because I didn\u2019t flat-out refuse to donate to it. She directly sent the link to me and asked me to share it with my followers, and my reply was just that I didn\u2019t want to do that because it would throw off my normal content and people might think my sharing of it meant it was a much more desperate situation than it actually was\u2026 and that\u2019s what started all this drama. I didn\u2019t explicitly tell her I wouldn\u2019t donate (but I haven\u2019t donated).", "That\u2019s a shitty reason. It is not a friendship if it is conditional.", "I don't even understand this expectation that OP MUST love their friend's kid. \n\nI believe that love is an emotion that should not be demanded, and nor should be expected for people who have only just been born and you don't know yet.", "In the same vein, we don't know anything about OP's financial situation. So making a judgement based on not donating seems a bit unfair.", "If you think she's so wrong you can make a donation in her name.", "Wait are you saying they took out 80K in debt for medical treatment and that's why they started a donation page?", "NTA. They sound as though they have lost perspective a bit. Stick to your guns.

It\u2019s not a requirement and it\u2019s not an indication that you don\u2019t care", "NTA.   \nNahhhhhhhh. They make 6 figures and they want to crowdfund? Nah GTFO.", "NTA. I would report their page as well. These people do not need help or donations. Can you make an anonymous comment about how much they earn, the approximate value of their home, etc. ? So people know they're donating to entitled rich people.", "I agree. I\u2019ve unexpectedly had major surgery (today), which was brought forward by 4 months without notice. It meant I didn\u2019t have my expected time to save etc and has placed some financial strain on me.\n\nOne of my friends suggested crowdfunding and I knocked that on the head straight away. I can\u2019t stand it when people put their hand out for everything  and expect all of their friends to foot the bill. I also don\u2019t want everyone knowing my business. The whole thing is just Ick\n\nEdit for clarity: I live in Australia so my surgery has cost me nothing, but the 6-8 week recovery period where I can\u2019t work is what has caused the financial strain.

Wishing you a speedy recovery! \n\nOh and NTA for judgement.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "80k for the home improvement.", "My reading is that they took out an 80k loan to build an extension on their house and the 8k medical treatment expense happened afterwards.", "NTA. How about they don't spend more than they earn? They already have more than average people have and they're using their sick child to act like entitled beggars.", "NTA, crowfunding should be for people in need. It seems like they do well for themselves, and can afford 8000. Maybe they should have checked with insurance first!", "NTA for the reasons you already listed", "NTA\u2026 But for the sake of the friendship and as an acknowledgment of what they are going through (with their ill son, not financially) I would probably donate $50 or $100 or something.\n\nObviously if you don\u2019t have the means to do that, there\u2019s no obligation. But I think they\u2019re probably just wanting some acknowledgment of what they\u2019re going through with their son and they\u2019re feeling a bit judged by you. \n\nAgain, you\u2019re NTA, but I think I they\u2019re just looking for empathy right now and not to be judged.", "While many of us can empathise with parents wanting to give their child the best life they can, a play area in what is already likely a sizable home is not a crowd funding necessity. What it is, is an entitled and misappropriation of a fund raising platform - especially if misrepresented.\n\nBravo to you and NTA.", "NTA - if you think that's the case,  probably everybody thinks the way you think. They probably have house/car loans and just using their kid. \ud83d\udc80", "NTA and thank you for choosing to do the right thing instead of just saving your friendship", "NTA crowdfunding is fancy begging, and if you're panhandling, you damn straight better NEED the money.", "NTA. It\u2019s gross when financially stable people & well off people use crowdfunding to buy non essentials.", "I'd share it, but make it visible to only them..... Win win.", "NTA. If you have the option to either not pursue big projects or maybe even sell some of your expensive stuff to help pay for a medical treatment, you don't need GoFundMe. They need to sort themselves out and not ask strangers to help fund a lifestyle they're unwilling to step back from.", "NTA honestly in todays era of people who don\u2019t really need the help doing it and getting large sums of money and people who have donated finding out about the deception, it\u2019s a risk to you.\n\nI\u2019m sure if its discovered why they really need the money from their own poor financial choices you would take the fallout with them for being the one to share it knowing the truth. Don\u2019t cave and if they choose to stay mad oh well you are only responsible for your own feelings and choices.", "We just did a go fund me for my nephews funeral and when I posted it I didn\u2019t send it to anyone specific, and stated if you wanted to pledge, thank you, if you wanted to share it, thank you. The fact they are coming for you so intently is because they think your network is ripe for the tapping. NTA and if you do have a social media following, it can affect your brand perception too.", "NTA. At all. They're feeling mighty entitled to other people's funds to pay off a credit card, regardless of the reason. Zero percent too? Takes some gall.", "NTA. $8,000 won't be much to them, and they only said they're doing it to pay of the debt *faster.* Not that they couldn't afford it. \n\nAnd I may be biased because I've been forced to stop working for 6 months due to a major medical crisis and now am in poverty myself (by the way, I'm not trying to be lazy, I absolutely love working and finally have become well enough to start a new job which I very much enjoy), but I agree, the money should be going to people who actually need it. Heck, I wish I could do a fundraiser for myself, but honestly I'd rather pay off my debts myself instead of going around begging people for money just to pay off my debt faster when I'm fully capable of working and do have a roof over my head. Well, unless I can find a sugar daddy/momma, that is, lol.", "NTA what your friends are doing actually borderlines fraud", "You don\u2019t need a reason period. However\u2026 I think we\u2019re being asked to judge OP\u2019s reasoning. \n\nAnd I find the reasoning to be sound and rooted in values of fairness and compassion. Sometimes when we\u2019re in the middle of a difficult time, or we\u2019re angry about being treated unfairly (eg the $8K treatment not being covered) we focus on being hard-done-by. I get that. \n\nI think that asking strangers for money requires that you meet certain threshold of need/desperation. Or at least disclosure. As in, \u201cour child will get the treatment whether you fund us or not. But if you don\u2019t, we might need to slow down our renovations or reassess our vacation plans.\u201d\n\nNot making the disclosure contributes to cynicism about mutual aid. And that will mean that someone won\u2019t donate to a family who is about to get evicted. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s fucked up. \n\nOP is totally NTA.", "Best answer so far.", "Exactly my thoughts.  Six-figure income and they start a gofundme so they can pay off a credit card faster?
