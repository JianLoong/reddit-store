{"id": 19723, "submission_id": "149th54", "title": "AITA for refusing to share or donate to my good friend\u2019s fundraiser?", "selftext": "We\u2019re all mid-30s here.\n\nMy very close friends (a married couple) have a young child who has some serious health issues. Insurance covers most of the things he needs, although my friends go above and beyond to make sure he has anything and everything that could possibly give him a better shot at living a long healthy life, so they probably spend more money on him than you\u2019d spend on a typical healthy child. \n\nThey make 6 figures and live in a large house in a good neighborhood. They recently took out a loan to put an edition on their house to add a new playroom for him (nothing to do with his conditions, just to give him bonus space to hang out). Shortly after they took out this loan, their insurance denied their request for something they felt their son really needed. It was $8,000 so they got a new credit card (with an introductory 0% APR) and bought it for him.  \n\nSeveral days later, my friend announced that they\u2019d made a crowdfunding page to help pay off the credit card faster. On the page itself, she just explained his conditions and why he needs this thing, but no details about their financial situation. To me, she said they need help because they wouldn\u2019t have taken on the project with their house if they\u2019d known insurance was going to deny them this, they shouldn\u2019t have to pay for this themselves, and this will really slow down their plan to pay off their debt. She asked me to share their fundraiser to my friends (I have a lot more followers then her). I politely declined, and she was furious. She accused me of judging them for needing help, and of not loving their son. \n\nI do love their son very much, but I suppose I am judging her for thinking she needs help. I view crowdfunding as something for people who are desperate, who really need charity. My friends are people who live and eat well, have clothes to wear and a roof over their head, who don\u2019t think twice about ordering a new toy or game or kitchen gadget from Amazon, and who have willingly taken on tens of thousands of dollars in debt for something they definitely don\u2019t need. I know the extra $8,000 was not something they\u2019d planned for, but it\u2019s also not going to break them. They make double what I make and probably triple what half my social media friends make. I don\u2019t want to share their fundraiser to a bunch of people who don\u2019t really know them, and who might think that my friends are in a desperate situation. I think it\u2019s a better use of money to donate to people who really are in bad shape, whose electric is about to be shut off, who don\u2019t know where their next meal is going to come from, that kind of thing.\n\nMy friends are not speaking to me at the moment, so I\u2019m asking Reddit: AITA?\n\n\nEdit to answer some frequently asked questions:\n\n-I have a niche interest that has gained me many thousands of followers on social media. That\u2019s why she specifically asked me to share it, because that would let it reach a broader audience then just sharing it among family and friends.\n\n-I don\u2019t want to give too many personal details on his conditions, but he has a normal life expectancy and none of this is life-or-death. It is a lot for them to deal with and I don\u2019t want to belittle what they\u2019re going through, but to the people thinking he\u2019s like\u2026 about to die of cancer or something, it\u2019s not like that.\n\n-the go fund me is for $8000 for the thing to help his condition, not for the playroom. The playroom is relevant (in my mind) because they willingly took on $80,000 in debt for the playroom prior to finding out the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover the $8000, but are now balking at taking on this additional $8000 that they \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to pay\u201d.", "created_utc": 1686805955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149th54/aita_for_refusing_to_share_or_donate_to_my_good/", "score": 2101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My point is just that they took on $80,000 in debt without hesitation and this is a drop in the bucket in comparison. It\u2019s not that $8,000 is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back; it\u2019s more that they don\u2019t think they should have to pay for this, so if insurance won\u2019t do it, then they\u2019ll try to make their family, friends, and strangers do it instead?
