Insurance covers most of the things he needs, although my friends go above and beyond to make sure he has anything and everything that could possibly give him a better shot at living a long healthy life, so they probably spend more money on him than you\u2019d spend on a typical healthy child. \n\nThey make 6 figures and live in a large house in a good neighborhood. They recently took out a loan to put an edition on their house to add a new playroom for him (nothing to do with his conditions, just to give him bonus space to hang out). Shortly after they took out this loan, their insurance denied their request for something they felt their son really needed. It was $8,000 so they got a new credit card (with an introductory 0% APR) and bought it for him.  \n\nSeveral days later, my friend announced that they\u2019d made a crowdfunding page to help pay off the credit card faster. On the page itself, she just explained his conditions and why he needs this thing, but no details about their financial situation. To me, she said they need help because they wouldn\u2019t have taken on the project with their house if they\u2019d known insurance was going to deny them this, they shouldn\u2019t have to pay for this themselves, and this will really slow down their plan to pay off their debt. She asked me to share their fundraiser to my friends (I have a lot more followers then her). I politely declined, and she was furious. She accused me of judging them for needing help, and of not loving their son. \n\nI do love their son very much, but I suppose I am judging her for thinking she needs help. I view crowdfunding as something for people who are desperate, who really need charity. My friends are people who live and eat well, have clothes to wear and a roof over their head, who don\u2019t think twice about ordering a new toy or game or kitchen gadget from Amazon, and who have willingly taken on tens of thousands of dollars in debt for something they definitely don\u2019t need. I know the extra $8,000 was not something they\u2019d planned for, but it\u2019s also not going to break them. They make double what I make and probably triple what half my social media friends make. I don\u2019t want to share their fundraiser to a bunch of people who don\u2019t really know them, and who might think that my friends are in a desperate situation. I think it\u2019s a better use of money to donate to people who really are in bad shape, whose electric is about to be shut off, who don\u2019t know where their next meal is going to come from, that kind of thing.\n\nMy friends are not speaking to me at the moment, so I\u2019m asking Reddit: AITA?", "created_utc": 1686805955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149th54/aita_for_refusing_to_share_or_donate_to_my_good/", "score": 874, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My point is just that they took on $80,000 in debt without hesitation and this is a drop in the bucket in comparison. It\u2019s not that $8,000 is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back; it\u2019s more that they don\u2019t think they should have to pay for this, so if insurance won\u2019t do it, then they\u2019ll try to make their family, friends, and strangers do it instead? Which seems kind of crazy to me, because sure, in a perfect world, insurance would cover it and it would not be their responsibility to pay for it\u2026 but it also most certainly would not be the responsibility of a bunch of random internet strangers to pay for it, either. \n\nI\u2019d actually be much more comfortable donating to it myself than sharing it\u2026 I guess my title is misleading, because I didn\u2019t flat-out refuse to donate to it. She directly sent the link to me and asked me to share it with my followers, and my reply was just that I didn\u2019t want to do that because it would throw off my normal content and people might think my sharing of it meant it was a much more desperate situation than it actually was\u2026 and that\u2019s what started all this drama.

You\u2019ve got to be kidding.  I\u2019m truly sorry they have a child with serious health issues, but they should be ashamed of themselves. There are people with *real financial problems* that genuinely *need* crowdfunding type help. Having a superfluous play room built on that you can afford with your 6 figure income isn\u2019t one of those reasons.", "NTA. I have a son with a sensory processing disorder. We get all sorts of awesome equipment for him, but we don\u2019t do it unless we\u2019re sure the funds are there. We are well off for the most part.\n\nBut regardless of your friend\u2019s circumstances, you are not responsible for sharing or donating to their request for help. Nobody is obligated to do so. You can easily love them without offering financial assistance or asking people you know to.", "NTA. As gross as I think crowd funding is their situation is it is there right, it is also your right not to participate.", "NTA. Rich people asking for donation is ridiculous.", "NTA they don\u2019t Need the money they just want them so they don\u2019t have to cut back on their spending and lifestyle.", "NTA. I'd probably report the page and stop speaking to them. I can't abide this type of rich people shit.", "NTA, and that's how I would explain it to my friend. If she still doesn't get it (especially the bit about her making 3x what half your followers do) then she's not a good person. That 8k has to come from somewhere, and though she feels she \"shouldn't have to pay\" for something insurance might have covered, that doesn't make it other people's responsibility.", "NTA They sound spoiled af", "Nope they should not eat out as much be more wise with money. Go fund me pay off credit card.. dirty Shady move. There people who can't even eat 3neals a day do they can get medicine for their children...they try pull this shit", "Nta.\n\n They make way more in 1 year then I do in 5.  It's called living within your means.", "NTA.", "NTA.  You are correct.  Crowdsourcing websites are for people who desperately need help.  Obviously anyone can use those sites, but people who don't really need it such as your friends are AH's for using it for personal gain.", "NTA but the gravy train for your kid has come to a crashing halt. Couldn't you have shared it and made it only visible to them so they get the illusion of a share without actually sharing? That's probably what I would have done...", "NTA\n\nKinda shocked cause I started a GoFundMe for my brain surgery. Like\u2026 I was beyond desperate figuring out how I was gonna feed my kids and afford to keep our home. I needed that surgery. And I was STRESSED to even imagine asking for help. Like I don\u2019t judge people who ask for help\u2026 but it just rubs me weird they are so well off that they can get an addition and a credit card without developing stomach ulcers from the stress\u2026.and then go and start a crowdfund. I agree with you honestly.", "NTA you should tell them\" you make double and triple what I make and just put an addition on your house. I'm not paying for your bad financial decisions. I love your kid but you are trying to bleed less fortunate people and that is not ok\"", "And they might be Fuckin themselves. All of those fundraisers or donations they receive are taxable", "ESH. No, you don't have to share anything you don't want to on socials. However, you are MASSIVELY JUDGING your \"friends.\" You can't stand that they're well off and you disagree with how they're spending their money. That's not very friendly at all. Additionally, it's not for you to decide if any of your friends on socials wants to donate. If you don't want to post, that's fine, but don't thinly veil your contempt for them while smiling in their faces. That's why the lady got upset in the first place.", "The next evolution of this already tacky trend is to just post your cashapp/venmo username and ask for money straight-out. \n\nMy favorite is when I see a cute message about being on their way to Disney World scribbled on the rear windshield of the car in front of me on the highway. \"Buy us a drink at Epcot! $givememoneyasshole\" Imagine being on your way to Disney and begging people on their way to work to give you money to buy a drink when you get there.", "One of my coworkers (and technically superior to me because I was just an intern) wanted me to donate to her son's Go Fund Me. It was for an f-ing BOAT! Not an extravagant boat, but a luxury nonetheless.", "Exactly. And not just GoFundMes. I would qualify for assistance in paying my medical bills just because of my diagnosis (ovarian cancer) but while they\u2019re super high and means cutting back in other areas I can totally afford it. There are people who can\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t get the care they needed if I went ad took funds I didn\u2019t absolutely need.", "To me what's worse is people who share gofundme pages and when I look at the list of donors they aren't even on it!", "Right!! Do I wish my debt was lower?? Yup. I\u2019m not going to ask strangers for money lol also if they are adding rooms to their house and buying something he doesn\u2019t necessarily need then maybe they should get a financial planner if they can\u2019t budget and save properly with higher incomes ? NTA", "And why would OP's followers feel inclined to donate, they probably know the fundees marginally if at all. So OP's 'friends' are playing on his street cred to bring in the bucks.", "It would not be a good deed to help them. She would be swindling her followers if she promoted this; outweighing any potential good for her friends.", "I didn\u2019t want to give too many details that might identify them or their fundraiser (or make them recognize themselves in this post, because I could see that angering them further). I\u2019m going to try to answer this as best I can while still keeping it fairly vague: He has a normal life expectancy and is not going to die from his conditions. He will likely need treatment/assistance for the rest of his life, but his condition can become more manageable and his quality of life can improve, which is why they are trying to do everything they can for him now.", "Compassion is free, yet you seem to be devoid of any compassion or kindness in your responses. \n\nTake a breather eh?", "I told her I didn\u2019t feel right sharing it because it was a big departure from my normal content and because me sharing it might make people think this is a more desperate situation than it actually is. I didn\u2019t feel like I could refuse without saying anything further, but I didn\u2019t want to get into too much detail and start an argument or make them question their choices or anything. (Although obviously, I think they do need to question their choices!! But for the sake of our friendship, I was hoping to avoid this kind of arguement\u2026)", "The treatment is not covered under their plan, under any circumstances. They just weren\u2019t aware of that fact, going in.", "I would even go so far as to say the friends are free to shake their cup at whomever they like. Money can't buy class, and if they want to beg for scraps from their mansion and not realize how other people see it, go ahead. \n\nBut asking OP to share the fundraiser is truly scummy. People who know them directly aren't donating, so let's add a degree of separation and ask someone else to vouch for me to *their* friends. Then, if those people aren't swayed by the message alone, instead of having personal experience with the couple to fall back on to help make a jusgement, they'll use *OP's* reputation to judge them by and be more likely to give. It's really quite a slick idea, but I don't blame OP for not wanting to put their stamp of approval on a fundraiser they don't even agree with.", "This wasn\u2019t even for treatment it was for a playroom (which of course insurance won\u2019t cover as it\u2019s not vital to his health)", "Hello, hope you recover soon! Good luck!", "But it *would* hurt OP reputation wise, after she promotes it, some of her followers start following the people they donate to, and then watch them put on an extravagant bonus room addition and take vacations and eat out constantly - yeah that would get back to OPs followers and damage her rep.\n\nAnd no is a complete sentence for something like this - it was a demand for OP to help them basically scam the public into donating. The people making the unreasonable demands are the ones risking their friendship", "Making a go fund me for a game room you can afford is called being TA", "Wow. A condition that he will need treatment for his entire life. So the medical bills will continue to be there for the rest of his life. And they are doing everything they can so he can have quality of life. \n\nAlso you said can be more manageable, so it\u2019s not now. \n\nHow much suffering would make the poor kid sick enough for you to have compassion?", "Seriously, if they both have 6 figure incomes then they bring home a minimum of $17,000 per month.  They could pay off this debt with their next paychecks.  Shady behavior.  Op is nta.", "Well said.", "No they don't have the money for the treatment as they are building a playroom, at least that is what I understood", "Their gross is a minimum of $17,000. After deductions income taxes, social security, Medicare, etc, their take home will be substantially less. Still, it's ridiculous they are doing a doing a crowd funding and pissed OP won't promote it. NTA"]}
