{"id": 28349, "submission_id": "171bdg3", "title": "AITA for making my husband sell his old car?", "selftext": "For the past few months, I (F41) have been decluttering our house. We had a lot of unnecessary junk that we hadn\u2019t touched in years, and it was about time we got rid of it. The one unnecessary item that has remained is my husband\u2019s (Greg M46) second car.\r\n\nIt's an old Pontiac from 2005 that mainly just sits in our garage. Greg absolutely loves that car for no apparent reason. The car spends basically all year sitting in our garage covered in a special blanket, and Greg drives it less than 10 times a year. He has always maintained that it\u2019s a collector's item and that is why he wishes to keep it in such good shape, but I honestly don\u2019t see the point. He only puts money into it and drives so little.\r\n\nI\u2019ve told him several times that I wanted the car gone so we\u2019d have some more space in our garage, but he has remained adamant that he\u2019d be keeping the car and eventually passing it on to our son (M7).\r\n\nI didn\u2019t like this idea for two reasons. One, an old car seems unsafe, and two, that doesn\u2019t solve the issue of the car taking up so much of our space. We argued about whether or not to sell the car for a few weeks, and Greg finally relented, and we did. We got a surprising amount of money from it.\r\n\nWith the money, I bought us two new TVs, several new appliances, a new couch, and several home improvement items, among other things. We have about 12k of the money remaining, which I plan to spend on renovating our backyard and garden in the spring.\r\n\nGreg has not been taking the car\u2019s sale easily and often says things like he wishes he still had it and wonders if the dealership has sold it yet. A few days ago, he even started to mention how much sentimental value the car held. I was really annoyed by this since he had been doing this for days, and I did (probably too harshly) lash out at him. I said some things that probably weren\u2019t kind and asked him to stop talking about it since we were beyond that point. He has not mentioned it since.\r\n\nYesterday, I was on a group call with my mom (F77) and younger sister (F36). We were catching up and I mentioned how we\u2019ve been improving our home. When I said that we sold Greg\u2019s car to fund it, they weren\u2019t exactly happy about that since they thought the car was his most prized possession.\r\n\nI told them that it was needlessly taking up space and we got good money for it. But they downplayed that and said things like how I couldn't put a price on items like that. When they asked how Greg took the situation, I told them about our most recent argument. My sister became pretty upset then and said I was being overbearing and difficult. I was annoyed with this, so I told her that it was none of her concern and that she should not attempt to meddle in my relationship.\r\n\nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1696596293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171bdg3/aita_for_making_my_husband_sell_his_old_car/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a sentimental item that he planned to give to your son, and would indeed have been a collector\u2019s item down the road especially if he was keeping such good care of it. I would be upset too if I had to give up something like that and all I got out of it were a couple of pointless tvs, a sofa, and a few appliances, and the grass in the back yard being slightly different next spring. I\u2019d rather have the car, and clearly so would he. I really don\u2019t know why a few new TVs, etc, meant more to you than his feelings and an heirloom between him and your son that evidently had meant a great deal to him.\n\nSell your jewellery if you want to buy a new TV next time.", "You nagged him into submission and got him to sell his prized possession. Then you spent the money on TV's and appliances. Just remember this when your marriage goes pear shaped.", "YTA - You are demanding. The car meant something to him and he made it clear but you made him sell it for your wants.", "So by \"2005 Pontiac\", you likely mean a 2005 Pontiac GTO with a 6.0L V8 because that's the only Pontiac from 2005 that I can think of that somebody would keep this long.\n\nYes, YTA. He told you it's a collector's item because it definitely could end up being one since v8s are on their way out. The fact that you don't want your son to drive it in 10 years because \"safety\" is BS too. It'll be almost 30 years old by then. Nobody daily drives cars like that. Taking a Sunday drive twice a year really isn't dangerous. \n\nSo, in essence, you made him sell his prized possessions that could end up a part of American history for TVs, which were probably made by children in Bangladesh. Honestly, if I was your husband and there wasn't a kid, I'd probably divorce you over it.", "Omg, you have completely disregarded your husband's feellings. In fact by reading your post i get the feeling you are a narcissist, all you care about is what you want and screw everyone else.", "YTA. You made a tantrum about keeping his dream. It is the one thing that was his personal possession. And about the car not being safe is ludicrous. You just wanted an excuse to sell it. Think about the one thing you cherish so much, something that you can\u2019t bear to part with, and he got rid of it. You did that to him.\n\nMy husband was also a car guy. We had one classic and actually had a lot of people including teens wanting this car. We rarely drove it, but I never complained. I got the house and what went in, his domain was the garages. As long as I could park my car in one.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t even let him have this one thing. And you brag how YOU spent some of the money. Regarding TVs, I have 5 in my house. I can only watch one at a time\n\nYour sister is correct in calling you out. You are overbearing and difficult.

You bought 2 TVs, do you watch them at the same time? Highly doubt you even needed all the things you bought to maintain the comfortable lifestyle you want. Eitherway, where do you get off selfishly spending the money from his car, you didn't buy those items for him and yourself, you bought them solely for yourself, stop gaslighting. \n\nI assume you are as critical of your own belongings as you were your husbands, hows your wardrobe looking? Jewelry maybe? Got any hobbies you fancy giving up?", "YTA - The car was obviously special to your husband and he put a great deal of time maintaining it. Some things you can\u2019t put a price on.

How would you feel if he went through and got rid of your stuff that you want to keep?\n\nYou are selfish controlling and an AH. You need to have him go around the house and get rid of things that are yours. The least you could\u2019ve done was give him half of the money to do whatever he wanted with.

Big time YTA...", "YTA.     You nagged and wore him down over something he loved.  You really couldn\u2019t stand the fact that he loved something you didn\u2019t understand?     My first wife also pulled this with me and she got away with it too.   I\u2019m still heartbroken over several cars she sent away and it really set a standard for what I needed in a second wife.

You\u2019ve told him his opinion and happiness doesn\u2019t matter and your improvements and things you deem important are worth more than his opinion. How rude and utterly selfish. \n\nIf that car is paid off and it made your husband happy, as long as you were not struggling to put food on the table or about to lose your house, this should have never gone further than an initial discussion and then have been dropped.

I'm a car guy and reading that broke my heart. You got rid of his baby for some dumb flatscreens and a couch. More importantly, you took away something that makes him happy, and you used the money to buy stuff for yourself, that makes you happy, like the couches and rennovation etc. If you wanted more space for all your crap you could have built a shed or something. If you wanted a new couch or tv you could have saved up some money. Enormously selfish", "YTA - you bullied your husband into selling something that he loved.

It had a lot of value to him beyond the monetary, and you've disregarded that as though his feelings don't matter at all.\n\nAdding insult to injury, you're using the money for what you want. I don't care if you have totally joint finances, that money should have gone directly to your husband, and if you saw a penny of it, it should have been only because he allowed it.

The only valid argument was if you had fallen on hard times and needed the money to pay rent, buy food, prevent eviction.\n\nAnd another thing: Every time he watches TV, he will think of his car. When he goes to the fridge, he will think of that car. When he sees the new \"garden\", he will think of his car. When your son turns 18, not only will he think of his car, he will miss out on the joy of giving it to him, and teaching him how to maintain that car.

We had a lot of unnecessary junk that we hadn\u2019t touched in years, and it was about time we got rid of it. The one unnecessary item that has remained is my husband\u2019s (Greg M46) second car.\r\n\nIt's an old Pontiac from 2005 that mainly just sits in our garage. Greg absolutely loves that car for no apparent reason. The car spends basically all year sitting in our garage covered in a special blanket, and Greg drives it less than 10 times a year. He has always maintained that it\u2019s a collector's item and that is why he wishes to keep it in such good shape, but I honestly don\u2019t see the point. He only puts money into it and drives so little.\r\n\nI\u2019ve told him several times that I wanted the car gone so we\u2019d have some more space in our garage, but he has remained adamant that he\u2019d be keeping the car and eventually passing it on to our son (M7).\r\n\nI didn\u2019t like this idea for two reasons. One, an old car seems unsafe, and two, that doesn\u2019t solve the issue of the car taking up so much of our space. We argued about whether or not to sell the car for a few weeks, and Greg finally relented, and we did. We got a surprising amount of money from it.\r\n\nWith the money, I bought us two new TVs, several new appliances, a new couch, and several home improvement items, among other things. We have about 12k of the money remaining, which I plan to spend on renovating our backyard and garden in the spring.\r\n\nGreg has not been taking the car\u2019s sale easily and often says things like he wishes he still had it and wonders if the dealership has sold it yet. A few days ago, he even started to mention how much sentimental value the car held. I was really annoyed by this since he had been doing this for days, and I did (probably too harshly) lash out at him. I said some things that probably weren\u2019t kind and asked him to stop talking about it since we were beyond that point. He has not mentioned it since.\r\n\nYesterday, I was on a group call with my mom (F77) and younger sister (F36). We were catching up and I mentioned how we\u2019ve been improving our home. When I said that we sold Greg\u2019s car to fund it, they weren\u2019t exactly happy about that since they thought the car was his most prized possession.\r\n\nI told them that it was needlessly taking up space and we got good money for it. But they downplayed that and said things like how I couldn't put a price on items like that. When they asked how Greg took the situation, I told them about our most recent argument. My sister became pretty upset then and said I was being overbearing and difficult. I was annoyed with this, so I told her that it was none of her concern and that she should not attempt to meddle in my relationship.\r\n\nAITA?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But not only it had monetary value, but also hugely sentimental? That you made him sell what could have been a family heirloom your son would have treasured getting from his father, would have meant more than money ever could to to a son, But all you saw was a waste of space. \n\nAnd then when you made him sell something that he cherished you proceed to take control of the entire pool of money and do whatever you want with it. \n\nDid anything you replace actually need to be replaced? Was anything actually broken or are you just \"keeping up with the Joneses\"? (I kind of side-eye people who immediately want to replace functioning things just to have something \"new\", instead of doing something to actually help cut down bills like getting solar panels.) \n\nAlso why do you need to renovate the backyard and garden? Is it a safety issue for your son back there? Or are you into gardening and you want it nicer? Is the space already nice and you just want to make it nicer?
