Since 2021 I\u2019ve done babysitting in order to get a little cash during the summer and school year, and it\u2019s been great. My most common client is Jen 33F, her husband Nate 35M and their three kids, Joy 9F, Dylan 6M and Paige 4F. I\u2019ve been babysitting for them for about 10 months, and I\u2019ve gotten to know them very well, so since summer started I\u2019ve become more like a nanny for them. I\u2019m there from about 8 am to 6 pm monday to thursday, and sometimes I work on weekends when they need extra help. The kids are all nice and usually behave.\n\nI thought that everything was going well until this past monday. Nate works from home half of the time but he doesn\u2019t like to be bothered (he works in IT) so I try to take them out on the days he\u2019s there. On monday we went out to the park, and on the way home we stopped for ice cream because it was hot out and I wasn\u2019t just gonna get ice cream for myself. I know what flavors Jen and Nate like so I thought it would be nice to bring Nate a cone since he\u2019d be done working by the time we got back. So I did, and he seemed to appreciate it.\n\nJen did not. On monday night, after I already went home she called and started cussing me out, calling me a whore and a bitch and accusing me of trying to steal Nate from her. She said that she noticed the way that we looked at and talked to each other when I went to the zoo with them earlier this month, which was weird because we just talked about naruto and demon slayer for most of the trip when we weren\u2019t talking about animals and the ninja turtles with the kids. She said that she was willing to ignore it and my outfit that day at first, but that I went too far by bringing him home a gift. Keep in mind IT WAS A $4 ICE CREAM CONE, I mean wtf She said that she knew what I was doing, that Nate is her man and he\u2019d never go for trash like me, then told me not to come back because if I did she\u2019d make me regret it.\n\nI was near hysterics crying by the time she stopped cussing me out, I didn\u2019t really know what else to do so I texted Nate and told him everything she said. I also told him that I would no longer be babysitting for them. He told me he\u2019d handle it but I didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nWell Jen texted me this morning and apologized. I guess that Nate either completely flipped out on her or she realized that she\u2019d have to quit her job if she couldn\u2019t find a babysitter, because she completely changed her tune. She said that she was \u2018mistaken\u2019 before, and that she was reading into things because she was stressed from work, and she asked me if I would consider coming back. I said no because of how uncomfortable I felt with her now.\n\nShe asked me again, saying that the kids missed me yesterday and I\u2019d be putting them all in an awkward position if I didn\u2019t come back, but I still said no. Then she accused me of not caring about the kids, so I stopped replying.
