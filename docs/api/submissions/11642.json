Linda was most likely just the messenger. \n\n>I'm sorry, I am not of belief that just because someone deserves scorn that its ok to put them in a position to receive it.\n\nHow did OP put Linda in a position to scorn her? OP's bodily autonomy should be none of Linda's business as long as she isn't doing anything inappropriate. If Linda's own personal beliefs put her in a position to receive scorn, then that's on her. \n\n>You could've politely declined going\n\nWhy?

Like, would you tell OP to go do a different church just to avoid dealing with one minister? No, bc that's ridiculous. It's an unfortunate aspect of living in society-going to school, work, and social groups like churches and extracurriculars-that you're going to interact with ppl whose values don't align with yours. Sure, you can make an effort to not interact with them as much as possible, but sometimes you just have to suck it up and deal with it. \n\n>I'm a commenter on a sub where we judge folks based on their actions.\n\nSo you have a logical reason for telling OP to decline helping out with a church retreat when she wants to? What is it?", "Honestly just a typo I didn\u2019t even realise until Now", "No. I just wouldn't associate with Linda. If this trip is a \"must go through Linda\" affair, then this trip would be a no-go for me. If the church was full of Linda's then yes, leave the church.

You don't have to deal with people like this, and if they ask something of you, you can decline.\n\n> So you have a logical reason for telling OP to decline helping out with a church retreat when she wants to? What is it?\n\nCause Linda, the asshole OP knows is an asshole, asked. As I said, I see no logical reasons to accept invitations from assholes. You can decline them. If the only way this church retreat's is via an asshole, figure out another way.", ">No. I just wouldn't associate with Linda.\n\nI don't think you understand how this works. OP goes to the same church as Linda. Not associating with her in any capacity is not a possibility. There may be church events that Linda hosts that OP wants to participate in. Is OP supposed to deprive herself of things like that just bc one person has views that OP doesn't agree with? \n\nAlso, if OP doesn't mind ignoring Linda and doesn't care what Linda thinks of her, what's the issue? Linda can have her issues with OP and OP can handle them however she sees fit. \n\n>If this trip is a \"must go through Linda\" affair, then this trip would be a no-go for me.\n\nSo let me get this straight, you're saying that bc *you* personally wouldn't have done it, that means OP shouldn't have as well? Bc that's not okay. \n\n>I don't agree its ok to intentionally antagonize even bad actors.\n\nOP expressing her bodily autonomy is not intentionally antagonizing someone. Linda has no say over what OP does with her body. If she has a problem with something OP does with her own body, that's on her to get over-it's *not* on OP to conform to someone else's views on how to treat her body to avoid \"antagonizing\" them. \n\n>Cause Linda, the asshole OP knows is an asshole, asked.\n\nWhy does it matter that Linda asked? \n\n>I see no logical reasons to accept invitations from assholes.\n\nAgain, you're pushing *your* views onto other ppl. Just bc *you* don't want to deal with assholes doesn't mean other ppl are forbidden to.", "We have to agree to disagree on this one."]}
