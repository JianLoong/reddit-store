OP goes to the same church as Linda. Not associating with her in any capacity is not a possibility. There may be church events that Linda hosts that OP wants to participate in. Is OP supposed to deprive herself of things like that just bc one person has views that OP doesn't agree with? \n\nAlso, if OP doesn't mind ignoring Linda and doesn't care what Linda thinks of her, what's the issue?

Bc that's not okay. \n\n>I don't agree its ok to intentionally antagonize even bad actors.\n\nOP expressing her bodily autonomy is not intentionally antagonizing someone. Linda has no say over what OP does with her body. If she has a problem with something OP does with her own body, that's on her to get over-it's *not* on OP to conform to someone else's views on how to treat her body to avoid \"antagonizing\" them. \n\n>Cause Linda, the asshole OP knows is an asshole, asked.\n\nWhy does it matter that Linda asked? \n\n>I see no logical reasons to accept invitations from assholes.\n\nAgain, you're pushing *your* views onto other ppl.

They could have waited till after this event to dye their hair, or they could have bowed out citing personal reasons, but instead decided to fuck with a minister because they don't like them.\n\nop is free to dye her hair and doesn't have to ask permission from anyone, but this is akin to me getting a giant mohawk the day of a professional meeting. I am free to do it , there is nothing codified preventing me doing it and I think it would be cool, but there would be blowback, so I don't.\n\nAlso let's not pretend like the fact that this would embarrass someone she didn't like never crossed her mind.", "In thy mercy.", "Well shit... Mines no longer Teal am I OK?", "Sac 2:10 \u201cGood luck ever bleaching that shit out though lmao\u201d", " Can I get an \u201cAmen\u201d?", "NTA. I'm a Minister, and if I wasn't bald, my hair would probably be purple. You're welcome in my church, with whatever colour of hair you happen to be wearing.\n\nP.s. isn't purple the colour for lent in many church traditions?", "NTA and good for you for helping out! Linda should be thankful.", "NTA because a quality dye job looks great.  Linda obviously associates such vivid colors with certain political beliefs.\n\nJust tell her you are trying to represent Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, from Acts 16.  Or to piss her off quote the various verses from Revelations but those kinda portray purple rather negatively.", "NTA. Demand that she show you the passage in the bible about hair color. When she can't, read a verse about loving everyone, etc. I'm not christian, so I'll leave that up to you. Make her realize what a bigoted jerk she is. And a hypocrite as well for hating others for no good reason, which isn't christian at all.", "NTA. You\u2019re helping for free and she\u2019s got a gross attitude about bodily autonomy. Screw her.", "NTA My hair is fire engine red/hot pink/vibrant purple and I was the liturgist at church a few weeks ago. I walked up and back with my pastor and she had absolutely no issues with my hair.", "Linda is why so many people reject organized religion.", "Ain't no hate like church people hate, NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm in one of my church's worship bands. I'm also one of the youth group leaders. I go on retreats often as a youth leader, I'm there once a week for youth group, and I'm singing on stage during Sunday service on an average of once a month.\n\nI have bright, unnaturally red hair. Think Ariel red. I also have tattoos. One especially is fairly sizable and on my upper arm. It was in full view this past Sunday morning when I sang in the worship band.\n\nDo any of my pastors give two shits? No. I know because if they did they would kindly and graciously let me know, but I also don't believe they would tell me to cover up or change my hair. They don't care because Jesus doesn't care. And if Jesus doesn't care that's a stupid hill for your pastor to die on, OP.", "I\u2019m Catholic so I can\u2019t relate to dress codes at church. But I don\u2019t understand why you went to a retreat with unconventional hair knowing your church is that conservative? Seems like you wanted to stir up drama so ESH. Linda for being difficult and judgmental and you for not checking in when you knew this would be a problem.", "NTA. A minister who gets stuck on superficial stuff like hair dye has no place tinkering with the hearts and souls of a congregation. \n\nThe tattoo'd minister down the road from me would think you looked rad.", "As a 75 year old purple haired woman I\u2019d tell her to pound sand\u2026she\u2019s certainly not exhibiting \u2019Christian\u2019 behaviour. In fact, it\u2019s people like her that drove me from the church. NTA!", "She sounds like a real Linda,  nta", "Even if you DID do it to piss off the minister - you\u2019re NTA. If someone is that bigoted, I vote for doing anything to piss them off more. There\u2019s plenty of ministers in other churches who aren\u2019t that bigoted. That\u2019s a her problem, not a you problem or a Bible problem.\n\nWear it proudly.", "NTA.  \n\n>I didn't dye my hair purple for the sole intention of pissing off Linda.\n\nWould still be NTA if you did.  IMO, you'd be a badass.  Fuck that woman and her opinions.", "You shoulda told Linda that god spoke to you in a dream and told you to dye your hair purple.", "My Southern Baptist church let all the girls at VBS kool aid dye our hair... failed for dark haired girls but the thought counts.\n\nSame bible belt people who made ALL kids wear shirts in a swimming pool because boy nips and girl nips are equally sinful.", "I think it's somewhere in the back.", "I love your last sentence.", "My school had a similar such policy. I've since dyed my hair purple. Guess who's getting her hair color refreshed a week before the class reunion? Yes, I am that petty.", "...\n\nI have so many questions about your username.", "Kool Aid dye?  Isn\u2019t that sticky as hell?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Idiots like that deserved to be antagonized. It\u2019s no different than people who discriminate against redheads because they\u2019re \u201c\u201d\u201dmarked by devil\u201d\u201d\u201d.", "4th-7th graders will love your hair!", "The holy verses of St. Journey, Bishop ZZ Top, Pope Toto, St. Freddie of Mercury, Sister Cyndi Lauper, St. Eddie Van Halen. \n\nLet\u2019s not forget Holy Madonna.", "It's so I don't get quoted in the news.", "No sugar in the kool aid packets. You add sugar for the drink.\n\nSuper hot water then let the flavor powder soak in your hair. Rinse.\n\nRed works great. Blue is okay.\n\nI know a friend that dyes wool this way too for her kid art classes.", "He did do that. Context is key. He did that to the people that were taking advantage of the poor in the temple by telling them their sacrifices weren\u2019t \u201cperfect\u201d enough for god and selling them a replacement.\n\nCalling out people who take advantage of people who can\u2019t stand up for themselves, especially where they are supposed to be protected if a good thing\u2026 however I don\u2019t suggest using a whip unless you are Indiana Jones.", "I bet you're a blast at parties.", "I expect it is super effective!\n\nI saw a newscaster talking about a twitter user (who saw a y'all qaeda terrorist parked in his car with a pile of guns outside the capital building); her name was fupa_mama or something like that.  The news definitely didn't know what her name meant!", "Hmm. Interesting. Never would have thought of that.", "SO weird, right?  Such a random coincidence.", "It washes out in a few showers/baths so it is a safer option for younger kids.\n\nMost temp hair dyes still have crazy chemicals.", "You *must* be re-baptized. Immediately. Under the water, heathen!", "At my age and given my past jobs, I don\u2019t have enough hair to dye, so\u2026I\u2019ll never know. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "It probably just migrated down.  You can still dye anything you like, and it's even more of a conversation starter!", "If others could see it, it definitely would start a conversation. \n\nMaybe not one I\u2019m prepared to have\u2026", "Preach, brother, PREACH!"]}
