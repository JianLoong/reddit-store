I got in on the ground floor of a start-up about 20-years ago and the business has since grown exponentially.  I am now in an executive level position.  My wife works in retail.  About 18-months ago, my wife was offered a promotion that would include a relatively small bump in pay, but would require her to start working weekends, something she was able to avoid previously.  They also dangled a carrot in front of her in the form of this promotion leading to a bigger and better promotion.  \n\nShe was very excited about the opportunity when she told me about it, but I expressed some concern about her having to work weekends.  She would have to work 5-6 weekend shifts every month, so pretty much 3/4 of the weekends every month.  I told her that is asking a lot of her when the bump in pay isn't that much, especially when we don't particularly need that extra money.  But she was so excited to advance her career that she disregarded my concerns and accepted the position.\n\nSince she started the new position, I have told her many times how I am feeling stressed and burnt out by not really having breaks during the week.  I work a stressful job 5 days a week, and then have to go into solo-parent mode almost every weekend.  On the weeks my wife works weekends, she gets 2 days off during the week pretty much all to herself, especially during the school year.  Yes, she uses this time to run errands and do things around the house.  But she also uses it to meet up with friends and do things for herself.  \n\nI do not have free time to do similar things for myself, my weekends are filled with activities for the kids.  The one weekend a month my wife doesn't work is allocated as \"family time\" at the request of my wife.  Whenever I brought this up to her, she would tell me that her position is temporary until she gets another promotion, but that hasn't happened.  \n\nThis summer, I started hiring a teenage girl in our neighborhood to watch our kids for a few hours twice a month on Saturdays so that I can go golfing with buddies.  It's done wonders for my stress level and the social interaction greatly improves my mood.  The kids look forward to it as well as they like the babysitter.  \n\nWhen I first told my wife about this, she was upset because not only am I spending money on a babysitter \"just for myself\" I am also spending money on golf, pretty much cancelling out the money she makes that day or even more.  When I tell her how much better I feel by having time for myself, she tells me that I should do that in a way that isn't so expensive.  \n\nThe last time she brought this up, I reminded her that even after her promotion, I still make over 2X what she does and that her bosses probably lied to her about another promotion because no one else would take the position she did.  She got mad at me for insulting her career and for spending \"hundreds of dollars every month just on myself.\"", "created_utc": 1692388886, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uuoml/aita_for_hiring_a_babysitter_so_that_i_can_go/", "score": 184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "NTA and your wife was a fool for taking that position without a timeline and written contract stating when the other promotion was to happen and what it entails. What she got isn't so much a promotion as it is just a means of getting someone to work the weekends and the \"raise\" is probably little more than the differential many retail places pay for working undesirable shifts.\n\nIt doesn't sound like the money you're spending on golf is a hardship. Denying you that outlet would just lead to other issues. Yeah, you could spend a couple evenings a month out with the guys but that's not something you'd want to do after working all day and if you take a weekend evening for it she'd complain that it's cutting into the time you have to spend together.\n\nI think your wife jumped at the word \"promotion\" without actually thinking it through. Either she gives up a day of her \"family time\" to cut the cost by one day of babysitting fees or she accepts that the cost of a couple days of golf a month is worth it for the physical and mental health benefits to you.", "NTA. You work a lot, earn significantly more money, so your input after paying for golf and the babysitter is still bigger, and spend more time with kids, there's no way to call you selfish or robbing your family of smth. You deserve small breaks and some free time to recharge.", "NTA.\n\nI mean, you\u2019ve got a bit of an attitude about her career, but ultimately, you\u2019re doing a bunch of weekend childcare, so nobody could accuse you of not supporting her career by expecting her to do more than her share of it.\n\nYour wife seems to expect you to have no leisure time, which is simply not reasonable.", "NTA - You'd play golf whether she worked weekends or not.  At some point in the not so distant future you won't need a babysitter. Also you BOTH need a break from child care.", "NTA - that's what a babysitter is for. Go live your life.", "NTA. \n\nShe forced solo-parenting on you without your consent. You're simply making the best out of a bad situation that she unilaterally created. \n\nIf it were me, I'd increase the number of hours and days to make it a real break, not just a few hours. But, I am the asshole. \ud83d\ude06", "NTA- my husband works weekends & has encouraged me to get a sitter if I\u2019m ever feeling like it.", "NTA. Your wife needs to wake up.

As long as the money isn't hurting your financial situation why does it matter?", "I think NTA. I would understand the concern about $$$ if you guys were in a tough place or something, but it sounds like you\u2019re ok financially since you said you didn\u2019t need the extra money her \u201csmall bump\u201d in pay would bring in. It\u2019s important for everyone to get time for themselves, parents or not, married or not, SAH or not\u2026 and it sounds like you still spend most of your time with your kids and that they are very happy with the situation. \nIs she maybe feeling some regret about taking this position? Maybe she won\u2019t say it to you, but you could be right about her work trying to basically trick her into the position without actual plans to promote her out of it again anytime soon and she has realized that and is feeling some sort of way. Or maybe she is just regretting giving up her weekends. That\u2019s hard when you have kids. \nThe only part were I felt like you could be TA is when you brought up how much more you made than her. That may have felt belittling to her and probably wasn\u2019t going to help the situation.", "NTA. \n\nShe can't complain about a unilateral decision you made for the family when she made one herself that put your family in this position to begin with. \n\nShe's being a hypocritical asshole here, plain and simple.", "Clarification: Did you talk with her about doing it first?  Who handles the children during the week after work hours?  What things is she meeting up with her friends to do?", "NTA but you could take the 10 yr old with you so they could drive the cart and you could get absolutely shitfaced", "I think you\u2019re a bit of an AH for how you talk to her about her job. Like it\u2019s not even worth it just because it\u2019s a small bump of money, when it means a lot to her to advance her career. And that she only got it because no one else wanted it. That\u2019s rude.", "ESH. You clearly have an attitude about her advancing her career. She made 3 kids and probably has not been able to do something truly for herself since the first one was born. Now that the 3 are in school, she wants her life back.

Was it okay for your wife to always handle the weekend child care while you went off to golf?  Did she get a break and time for herself then?  How long did this situations go on? Months ? Years? \n\nIf, as I suspect, she was always the de facto parent, while you were off having your mental health break and now when the roles are reversed, you are not willing to do the same. This is about more than golf. This is about more than hiring a babysitter ..this is about you saying you deserve better than you thought she deserved, and that my friend is  a recipe for divorce .", "YTA because your actions make you seem like a controlling hypocrite and that's why your wife is pissed at you.\n\n* Career: You think your career and aspirations are more important than hers and when she wants to do something to advance herself, you belittled it.\n\n* Childcare: When she took care of the kids on the weekends that was fine, and she didn't need a babysitter, but when you have to do it that's horrible and you deserve to hire a babysitter.\n\n* Money: When she wants to do something that brings in more money, that's bad, but when you want to do something that costs an astronomical amount of money, so much it cancels out her entire paycheck, that's fine.\n\n* Stress: When you're stressed and upset you can do whatever you want, but if she wants more for herself it's selfish and you get upset that she's not capitulating 100% to your \"concerns.\"\n\nDo you even like your wife? You're not acting like you respect her at all. My wife has an extremely expensive hobby and I was 100% in the room and on board when she dedicated our money to it, she didn't just say \"I'm doing this whether you like it or not\" after she told *me* that I couldn't do something for myself.\n\nThat's what you did. You said you are opposed to your wife doing something for herself, something that ***makes*** your family money, and to get back at her for doing something necessary, like being fulfilled with yourself, you did something that ***costs*** your family money, and isn't necessary.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with having a hobby or hiring a babysitter, but the fact that you did it in the most expensive way, unilaterally, after having a tantrum that she was contributing more money to the family is uh, a decision.\n\nIf I was your wife I'd be wondering right now if you ever loved me or respected me or just kept me around as a doormat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But possibly Y T A because your not being considerate of your relationship - see below. \n\nDo you guys split finances based on income percentages? Maybe she has some resentment bubbling because you have more spending money but are choosing to spend a lot of it on yourself and neglecting your relationship by not taking her on a date here and there. You guys may be parents but you were husband and wife first. (Or maybe not - but we\u2019re in some sort of romantic relationship prior to kids) Compromise?

She felt like I was exaggerating my stress level and how burnt out I was feeling and that I should just tough it out until she gets another promotion.\n\nSince her schedule is not set in stone during the week, she sometimes has to work evenings as well.
