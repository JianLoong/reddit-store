Because if he's doing it on purpose i'd go ballistic on him.", "I\u2019m feeling you as a shedding girl but I would cut the bf before the hair", "NTA. You should do what you want with your hair. I do want to add to the voices here saying that it's very concerning that when you set simple boundaries that a child wouldn't mind respecting, like \"please don't lay on my hair it hurts\", he throws a tantrum. This is not an acceptable way to live, where a haircut has you agonizing and asking strangers on the internet for advice. I hope you give it some thought.", "That is what I am thinking. Why is the boyfriend not respectful towards her.\n\nOP, NTA. Toss the boyfriend and find one who is respectful of you. This coming from someone who had hair your length about 20 years ago.", "Also she doesn't want to cut her hair for herself. She wants to do it so he stops being an asshole to her", "He sounds like a whiny little worm lmao. So unattractive \ud83d\ude2d", "Yeah I wonder if it is some kind of fetish. There's nothing wrong with having a fetish, but it's wrong to force it on others.", "Cut off the boyfriend? Jesus Christ this sub Reddit is full of bitter people lmao", "Right? Keep the hair, lose the boyfriend.", "I was thinking the same thing", "OMG the headaches. During the pandemic mine got way too long. I gave myself a hack job haircut, but it felt SO GOOD to have less weight pulling on my scalp 24/7", "Shoulder length is a good choice!", "Punishing him when he's constantly pulling her hair seems pretty reasonable to me.\n\nI think OP should reconsider the boyfriend altogether. Unless he has otherwise amazing qualities he sounds uncaring and selfish.", "And if he's willing to leave you over a haircut, he's trash \u2764\ufe0f.", "He's also free to stop pulling her hair if he wants her to keep it.", "Pseudo? My bf respects my bodily autonomy. Unlike the bf of OP who repeatedly disrespects her wishes. I'm not bitter for pointing that out. OP deserves better. Everyone does.", "Only one person here sounds bitter bud", "Why ask him? It\u2019s HER hair, her body! She can do what she wants and bf can lump it. Frankly she shouldn\u2019t even keep him he is a user.", "No.  The very last thing she should do is give her tantrum throwing boyfriend any more sense of entitlement toward her hair than he already has by running it by him and just having him pick one.

So if she likes having long hair why not dump him and keep the hair?", "No\u2026 simply full of people that dislike relationships that clearly are full of disrespect for one partner\u2019s body/boundaries. The boyfriend is a dick for not understanding why she doesn\u2019t want to constantly have her very long hair pulled because he can\u2019t manage to be mindful of his own body parts and how his positioning can make her uncomfortable, despite multiple attempts on her part.", "Note the next sentence starts with \u201cseriously though\u201d which indicates the statement was intended for comedic effect.", "This. I was just about to come and say I\u2019ve been with my partner for 5.5 years and he has never been so disrespectful of me and my body. He has always tried to make me comfortable as I have him and that is why we\u2019ve lasted this long. I feel sorry for Livid_Rip8609 if they think that having a partner means accepting abuse/disrespect of one\u2019s body\u2026", "Yeah, I'm bitter that this subreddit has a bunch of incredibly insensitive, judgmental dimwits and people come in here expecting some kind of verdict and 70% of the time they're advocating for the dumbest shit that is completely unrelated to the post. So what?", "Sure, comedic, just like the other 9 comments that say exactly the same thing.", "How is advocating for her to lose somebody who obviously doesn't respect her or her body \"the dumbest shit\"?\n\nPlease I'd love to hear your utterly backwards explanation", "Wtf do those comments have to do with mine? Mine was comedic. Go troll their posts.", "I think that just proves you're wrong bud \ud83d\ude09", "Someone is mad.", "Yeah, you \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
