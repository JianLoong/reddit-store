You know when someone on social media talks about a seriously abusive relationship and dozens of people chime in with \"why didn't you leave before? Surely there were signs.\" to blame the victim? There are signs, but they look like this. Emotional abuse always precedes physical abuse and it's insidious. It's a collection of small, almost invisible things like this that always look like they have a different explanation. There are always several layers of plausible deniability because the abuser wants to torment the victim without without it being obvious.

They're carbon copies of each other. But the two main things are a pathological aversion to accountability and not only disrespect of, but *contempt for* boundaries.
