She resented me from a very early age and made her dislike of me quite clear. As a kid it upset me a lot. She was my cooler older sister and Gabi was so well liked by others that it made me crazy that she was so awful to me. Our extended family used to tell my parents that they had changed Gabi's life too much and she was resentful of me because of the changes but our parents would say Gabi was just a brat and she would be thankful for a sister one day and I would be the most important person in her life.\n\nMy parents and Gabi fought a lot when I was a kid and I remember them telling her she'd be sorry she rejected me and that one day she would realize I am the most important person and relationship in her life. Gabi would tell them that the kid the replaced her with would never mean that much to her. My parents said she was overdramatic. They would also take me to do stuff that Gabi loved and that they used to say was their thing with her. That used to upset her a lot and made her dislike for me grow.\n\nI'm 23 and Gabi is 27. For the last 3 years our relationship has changed from being very cold and hostile to us getting along. Gabi apologized for how she treated me and said it was a shitty thing she did, taking her issues out on me, that were really issues with our parents. I told her I understood.\n\nAfter we started getting along our parents became so smug and they gloated to Gabi that they were right and she was wrong and look at us now, etc. Gabi would argue back but they would hammer their point home. A few times they even brought up Gabi's past treatment of me around others so they would know exactly how things used to be. Gabi grew frustrated and over a year ago she told our parents that they were not right about everything. That yeah, we were closer now, but I was not the most important person or relationship in her life. She said her most important relationship was the woman she loved more than anything, the woman she married, and they were wrong to think I would come before her wife. Our parents laughed in her face, told her she was still childish, and they were right. She went no contact that day.\n\nI went low contact after that and I was disgusted by how they treated Gabi. They didn't like it and recently they tried to talk to me during my cousin's quincea\u00f1era and find out why I was being so distant. During the same party they were bringing up how silly Gabi was and how right they were, etc. So when they came back to me I said if they only care about being right then they should leave me alone because I did not credit them for Gabi and me working out our relationship. \n\nMy parents were yelling and cursing and telling me I was disrespectful to them when Gabi was the one who treated me badly and that I should be more respectful, etc. They really derailed the party.
