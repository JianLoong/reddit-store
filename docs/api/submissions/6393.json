His childish approach is ridiculous.", "NTA. It\u2019s a fucking chair. If somebody legitimately shouted at me for sitting in a chair, I\u2019d leave too. What a lunatic.", "WTF. Sounds like this dude is simmering in toxic masculinity. What did your mom say when all of this was going on? I take it she did nothing and just let him verbally abuse you over a chair?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou drew a firm and reasonable line against some outdated behavior. You were respectful given your living situation; you didn\u2019t persist in the argument, you gave him time to make his (dumb) position clear, and you walked away without getting nasty.

Identifying it as the 'boss chair' and turning it into a battle of wills was entirely unnecessary.\n\nYou're an even bigger AH because you gave him a hard time about wanting to sit in his preferred chair in his own home for no reason other than you thought it was an attempt to \"assert his dominance\". I'm taking you at your word that you originally thought he was joking, but once he asked you several times, you should have given him the chair, even if you thought he was still being playful since it was clearly a big deal to him. The only exception would be if *you* had a specific reason for wanting to stay there *and you explained* your reason (e.g. \"I'm charging my phone and this is the only seat that it reaches...

There are any number of valid reasons why people prefer one chair over another that they may feel uncomfortable expressing (e.g. my grandmother always wanted her back to the wall and was super uncomfortable otherwise, but she didn't like explaining it was because she had a glass eye; it's embarrassing for me to explain that I don't want to sit in certain seats because I'm fat and it will be hard for me to squeeze that close to the wall or that I can't sit in the chair that has armrests). \n\nJust because he *should* have offered some kind of reason doesn't mean it was ridiculous or childish for him to have a preference. The fact that you assumed that it had to be a joke likely contributed to your AH-ish handling of the situation.", "I understand that.

Quite the opposite, actually.", "The type of guests you are referring to tend to leave the same day. You're pushing it.", "No on other chairs. Im talking arm chairs mainly.

Because why wouldn't you switch to an identical alternative? Why did you make him ask you multiple times? Certainly it didn't save you any time \n\nThat's why I chose ESH and that's why your mother is irritated at both of you.

Even stuff like, \"I always sit there so I can put my drink over where I'm less likely to knock into it, I'm afraid of knocking it over.\"\n\nI also think that a lot of the \"boss chair\" thing sometimes arises from mealtime organization.  I've known plenty of people who had \"their chair\" for dinner because they were the person most likely to get up to go get something, and that chair was easiest to get in and out of.  Or because they were stronger at lifting the serving plates or something.  (But that wouldn't be a reason to demand that chair in other circumstances, like a card game.)", "I know that.  That's...

I mean, \"we are dealing with this in the comments, and thus, the range of reactions we see here\".\n\nOf course I'm elevating my personal sense of what is polite.  So is everyone else commenting here.\n\nWhich is why OP really has to take all comments with a grain of salt.  We can't ALL be \"right\", and this is a situation that doesn't necessarily have a \"right\" answer.  OP just has to figure out which reactions match up the most with her own personal sense of what is polite, that she was raised with.  (Or, yeah, she has to evaluate whether some of the criticisms are worth taking on board, even if they are coming from a completely different perspective on what's polite.)", "She wasn't in the middle, she sides with him. She's an enabler and I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't the first time he's bullied people and she's stood by.", "Sure!", "Yeah, you and I are clearly largely aligning in what we consider to be polite behavior in this instance.  There \\*are\\* plenty of other viewpoints in the comments here, and they're clearly coming from other traditions and experiences that have influenced what they consider to be polite.  When it comes to matters of manners, you'll never get everyone to agree.\n\nThere may still be some good food for thought from comments that think you too were the AH.  It's always worth considering other viewpoints.  Or even, considering that Dennis's actions/reactions are in part the product of the manners and standards of politeness that HE was brought up with, and maybe that's where the conflict really arises.\n\nI do think that something a lot of people are missing -- and this includes your mother, from what you've said -- is that this is not really a fight over \"just a chair\".  Or, that that's the wrong way to put it.  \n\nBecause if it's \"just a chair\", and you shouldn't care whether you sit in it, or give it up to him... by that same logic, HE shouldn't care whether he gets to sit in it, or whether you get up to give it to him.   It \\*is\\*, or again should be, equally unimportant to both of you.\n\nTherefore, I'm always wary of people who advocate for \"don't rock the boat\" and \"give the person who gets upset what they want\".  In this case, from what you've described, it sounds like that person was Dennis, and I'm automatically, viscerally against the idea of giving in to the person who it feels like is getting unreasonably upset over \"nothing\".\n\nWhich is the thing.  It's NOT a fight over \"just a chair\".  It's a fight over whether a man should raise his voice to someone else over \"just a chair\", and whether a woman should \"just give in\" to a man who raises his voice to her over a meaningless demand.\n\nThere are a LOT of people who fall into that pattern of behavior.  Again, it may be in part how they were raised.  A LOT of women are raised to give way to the demands of a person in authority, especially if that person is upset or angry.  (But it's also important to acknowledge that a lot of men are raised to do that as well; and a lot of the authority figures who employ this tactic ARE women.)  \"Don't rock the boat\" becomes the most important indicator of what is correct behavior in a situation.\n\nI don't think you're wrong for wanting to resist that.  I don't love that that's your mom's viewpoint, although again, it may be worth examining whether that's because of HER upbringing or past experiences strongly instilling that behavior pattern in her.  For a lot of people, it is a defensive behavior -- it avoids an argument, and sometimes, there are good reasons to want to avoid an argument (such as in a household whether that can turn violent).\n\nIt's never \"just a chair\".

As other said, if someone demands you take your shoes off in *their* home, it doesn\u2019t matter whether they give you an explanation for why they\u2019re asking you to do that. You taking your shoes off wouldn\u2019t be subject to the condition that you are first provided an explanation. \n\nI\u2019ll bet if you try you could see how that point relates to someone asking to use their furniture in the home you\u2019re a guest at", "I have a feeling we are only seeing a highly edited version of the story and the OP was likely more antagonistic than they were letting on.", "The way I practice it, matching energy isn\u2019t the same concept as \u201can eye for an eye\u201d. It\u2019s treating the other person with the same level of respect they offer you. In an ideal world, this would encourage the other person to look at things from a different perspective seeing as they are on the receiving end, reflect on how that makes them feel, and then think about how their similar actions must make others feel.", "Wait until you are ready to leave. That needs to be sooner rather than later. You have very little power as their guest.", "Always entirely possible.", "Sounds great on the upside but it also sounds like you let people drag you down to their level.", "His level? He was screaming at her, so she *left*. It's not like she slapped him!", "Ohhh I see, that\u2019s my bad as I misunderstood a bit. Thank you for your input! :)", "YTA. Its his home that you are a guest in. You should of just gotten up. I would have.\n\nI have a particular spot in my own house that I sit in to watch tv for example. Its my home and my spot. I always sit in that spot. I wouldn't want my spot taken or disrespected in my home either.\n\nIts a respect thing. My mother and father were the same way as well.", "ESH. I mean\u2026 you are a guest at their house. And on the one hand, it is tradition for the hosts to sit at the head and foot of the table. But on the other hand, this wasn\u2019t exactly a formal dinner.  But on the third hand, it is common for people to have a \u201cfavorite\u201d chair, and as a guest it would be polite to not sit in their favorite chair if you can avoid it. So everyone was a bit rude here. Mostly him for insisting though and being all patriarchal.", "Info: why don't you leave their house if it's gotten so toxic?", "Yes YTA. It is his house. His spot at the table and his chair. He asked you to move in a kidding way and you didn\u2019t take the hint. Then when he let you know he was serious you got mad. Move out of his chair like he ask and quit being a brat. And, all this talk about toxic masculinity, please! I am a woman I have my chair in my spot at the table as does my elderly mother it\u2019s not uncommon", "NTA.\n\nThis is pretty much what happened between me and my brother. Except it was our parent's house that we all live in, and I wasn't having any of that, so we got into a screaming match. \n\nWe still don't talk. My mum begs for us to make up but I don't see why I have to bend over a bully so whenever we're in the same room I just pretend he doesn't exist. I guess it'll be pretty hard for you since you're a guest but do minimise contact if you can. All the best.", "NTA at all. I'm neurodivergent and I have my unofficial \"assigned\" seats at various places, but if someone, especially family or a guest, sits in \"my\" seat, I say nothing and sit in a different chair like a grown ass adult. This dude screams insecurity and toxic masculinity.", "OP does, that\u2019s for sure", "Bravo, wtf happened to all the reasonable people in the world? What's so toxically masculine about wanting to sit in your usual chair that you own? Martyrying yourself over someone else's property in their house, wow smfh", "I would pay good money to hear an alternate version of this story where OP\u2019s mom has a favorite chair and asks a houseguest to move so she can sit in it. I wonder what would be different\u2026", "You'd find your petty, need-a-place-to-crash axx on the other side of my front door too.....out of spite", "> we were both overreacting because it was \u201cjust a chair\u201d.\n\nShe's completely right. The verdict here is ESH except your mom. Why are you both fighting over who can sit on a chair? You're both full grown adults, so act like it. You are not in kindergarten anymore.", "Apparently you do \u201chave to\u201d understand his reasons, because otherwise you would have gotten up once he made it clear he was serious. Instead, you continued sitting there and demand he explain it to you. \n\nAs many others have pointed out, he could have a very good reason that he feels embarrassed articulating in front of others. It is absolutely more his home than it is yours so he shouldn\u2019t have to be coerced into embarrassing himself to meet your demands", "If someone is using your television to watch something, and then at a certain hour there\u2019s a live show you really want to watch, and you ask them to change the channel so you can watch the show, is it reasonable for them to refuse until you explain it to them or give them a reason that they deem worthy enough?", "I wonder if he was hurt by your attitude towards him, but I doubt you have the capacity to even consider such a thing bc you\u2019re convinced of your righteousness", ">I understand and wholeheartedly agree that I should respect the rules of the house I\u2019m visiting, that\u2019s basic courtesy. For example: no showers longer than 30 mins, no shoes in the house, clean your dishes when you\u2019re finished using them, etc\n\nIt seems like you only want to accept the rules that you agree with\n\n>  But it is not a rule that if I\u2019m sitting in a chair he wants to sit in, that he automatically gets priority.\n\nIt's obviously is a rule. He literally told you to move. **That's his rule.**\n\n> If that was a rule, I definitely wasn\u2019t made aware of it\n\nBy him telling you to move, that means you are made aware of the rule. If I start playing loud music in someone's home and the homeowner then tells me I can't do that. That means I have to turn off the music. I can't say to them \"You didn't make me aware of this rule before, so I'm going to continue playing loud music.\"\n\n> and it would be pretty barbaric lol!\n\nAgain, you only want to respect the rules you agree with.", "Oh I like this", "How convenient for the guest at the moment.", "The only one making assumptions here is you. [OP already clarified that it is Dennis's house](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102btqf/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_chair/j2t5z73/) and that it is not the house OP grew up in.", "Yeah, don't poke the bear. And it IS his house.", "From his end, what started as a simple request, said in a friendly enough manner to be plausibly confused for a joke, which was not taken seriously multiple times. Once he had made it very clear that he was serious, then this was still not respected. Then he lost his temper and yelled. Op needled him until he lost his temper and left.   \nPretend that is his spot on internal perspective.  That doesn\u2019t mean a single thing would change from OP\u2019s perspective.  I think she refused to respect someone\u2019s preferences in their own home then justified it as their own fault for having a faulty perspective.  Mom\u2019s sitting back thinking \u201cI love a couple of stubborn assholes\u201d and trying to keep quiet.       \nOp\u2019s stepdad sounds a bit anal and might be starting to resent a long term guest intruding in his routines. What I would do, as a guest, is try to respect his weird habits as a show of courtesy. If someone wants to put you up out of the goodness of their heart, you try not to let them being a nut prevent that (if it can be helped).", "You're arguing and trying to change people's opinions.
