His childish approach is ridiculous.", "NTA. It\u2019s a fucking chair. If somebody legitimately shouted at me for sitting in a chair, I\u2019d leave too. What a lunatic.", "WTF. Sounds like this dude is simmering in toxic masculinity. What did your mom say when all of this was going on? I take it she did nothing and just let him verbally abuse you over a chair?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou drew a firm and reasonable line against some outdated behavior. You were respectful given your living situation; you didn\u2019t persist in the argument, you gave him time to make his (dumb) position clear, and you walked away without getting nasty.

He's an AH because, once you didn't get his hint about letting him have his preferred chair, he should have calmly given you an explanation of some kind (e.g. \"I know it's silly, but I'm used to 'my' spot and find it disconcerting to sit in other places in this room\") or else suck it up and let you sit there. Identifying it as the 'boss chair' and turning it into a battle of wills was entirely unnecessary.\n\nYou're an even bigger AH because you gave him a hard time about wanting to sit in his preferred chair in his own home for no reason other than you thought it was an attempt to \"assert his dominance\". I'm taking you at your word that you originally thought he was joking, but once he asked you several times, you should have given him the chair, even if you thought he was still being playful since it was clearly a big deal to him. The only exception would be if *you* had a specific reason for wanting to stay there *and you explained* your reason (e.g. \"I'm charging my phone and this is the only seat that it reaches...

There are any number of valid reasons why people prefer one chair over another that they may feel uncomfortable expressing (e.g. my grandmother always wanted her back to the wall and was super uncomfortable otherwise, but she didn't like explaining it was because she had a glass eye; it's embarrassing for me to explain that I don't want to sit in certain seats because I'm fat and it will be hard for me to squeeze that close to the wall or that I can't sit in the chair that has armrests). \n\nJust because he *should* have offered some kind of reason doesn't mean it was ridiculous or childish for him to have a preference. The fact that you assumed that it had to be a joke likely contributed to your AH-ish handling of the situation.", "I understand that.

They decided to engage first, questioning multiple times \"are you serious\" which implies confrontation. They got up and left but it wasn't immediate.

Quite the opposite, actually.", "The type of guests you are referring to tend to leave the same day. You're pushing it.", "No on other chairs. Im talking arm chairs mainly.

Because why wouldn't you switch to an identical alternative? Why did you make him ask you multiple times? Certainly it didn't save you any time \n\nThat's why I chose ESH and that's why your mother is irritated at both of you.

You\u2019re right that usually everyone has their \u201cusual chair\u201d at home, but it doesn\u2019t represent your importance in the family. It doesn\u2019t represent anything. It\u2019s a chair. I think it\u2019s wrong to make guests move for such a petty reason. We all did learn to share in kindergarten, right?", "Okay I see, I guess this is just where we differ. In my house growing up, the guests always got the best seats. The reasoning is that since we invited them over, it\u2019s our responsibility to make them feel welcome and comfortable. This situation is a bit different bc I\u2019m not here for just a dinner, but there\u2019s also no shortage of chairs so I guess my example doesn\u2019t really work that well here hahaha!", "When you comment on someone\u2019s post, it\u2019s reasonable to expect a reply\u2026I don\u2019t think that equals confrontation lol", "Lol!!", "Then we shall need to agree to disagree here.", "O.o Rude? No not at all. What I mean is, you referring to yourself as a guest and correlating it to dinner guests who will probably leave at the end of the night is a bit of an over reach don't you think?\n\nWhenever I've stayed with family for even a week, after day 1 or 2 the mega hospitality is gone. My family wouldn't kick me out of a chair but if push came to shove I'm not dying on this hill, or in this chair.\n\nYou state all his bad traits, micromanaging, reminders of whose domain it is, etc. You let us know it wasn't a last resort place to stay. With all this information provided it's safe to assume you know he's an Ass. Yet hear you are asking us if you are an asshole for dealing with an asshole like an asshole. \n\nDoes that make sense? I have trouble expressing myself.", "I'm stating that when you don't like a person's opinion here, you feel the need to argue why they are wrong.", "Yes it makes sense! Overall, yes I do think he\u2019s an asshole. The reason I posted is to get the opinions of others if they think this is okay or not. \n\nTo me, a guest is a guest no matter how long they stay, unless they pay rent. That doesn\u2019t mean I think Dennis has to cater to my every beck and call, but I do believe I shouldn\u2019t be treated as if I\u2019m not as worthy of respect as he is. I just don\u2019t think I was an asshole for upholding my boundaries. Maybe I was an asshole for leaving the table? Idk. This whole \u201cplacing boundaries\u201d thing is new to me and I\u2019m trying to learn.", "This is a place to have discussions, I\u2019m discussing :)", "I'm with you. You DESERVE respect.\n\nI understand \"a guest is a guest no matter how long they stay\", but it just isn't that simple. One of those things that falls under easier said than done.\n\nYou're not an asshole for leaving the table. That was, imo, the best choice when dealing with an asshole, in his home at least. You're the asshole when you get into the back and forth with the asshole, in his home. You inevitably stoop to his level, usually due to frustration because you find what he is saying or doing so unreasonable.", "\ud83d\udc4d", "Genuine question: how can I uphold my boundaries, maintain respect for myself, and let him bully me into giving up my chair to him at the same time? I\u2019m having a hard time seeing what the right thing to do would have been. \ud83d\ude23"]}
