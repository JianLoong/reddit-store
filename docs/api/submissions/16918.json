You have every right to be upset with him, not so much your siblings (they are innocent here). But, this is something you should not worry or stress about - you literally have no control over this. In the end you will come out a much stronger and better person because of this.\n\nThe question here is how long are you going to let your dad impact your happiness?", "NTA. Your issue is with your dad not your step-sister/step-mom. Insulting, resenting either of them ignores the source: your dad.", "INFO: Have you asked your ever father for assistance since you were 18?", "Why do most fathers treat better their steps than their BIOS????? 95% of Times this happens", "NTA for having these feelings of resentment/jealously towards your step sister. It's so easy to get hung up on other's privilege. However natural the feelings might be, they are quite toxic and self destructive. I would probably seek professional help about letting these feelings go. If you don't want to do that, reflecting on your feelings in a constructive way is very helpful (cognitive behavioural techniques) \n\nThe underlying issue is between you and your father. I think you might be better off apologising for taking it out on your step sister. maybe there are other ways your dad can help you out financially if that is the root cause of the issue? \nThere is no need to burn bridges over this. Spend some quality time with your dad. He is probably going to be there for you emotionally and financially when you really need it and that's luckier than most people have it.", "NTA. You haven't actually done anything mean to your step sister, so I'm not sure why people are saying you are the asshole for resenting your step sister. You are allowed to feel how you feel, it's not like you attacked your step-sister or confronted her. You just said you talked to your dad about it, which is normal.\n\nI would maybe try to work through your feelings on this situation though, and try to remind yourself that your step-sister is not to blame. Your living situation has absolutely nothing to do with her. You lived with your mom, and moved out when you were eighteen because of the way that household was. In reality, this has no bearing on your step-sister, who lived in an entirely different household. \n\nIf there is anyone you should be upset with, it should be your dad. You had to move out and you struggled as a result, and it seems like you feel like he could have prevented you from struggling. That's something you should take up with him, not your step-sister. Especially since you were upset that he's gone on holiday with her and not you. Stop resenting her for your relationship with your dad.", "I am giving you an NTA but barely. Sorry, your dad sucks and your feelings of jealousy are justified, but you are 31. It's time to make your own life. The only person whos actions you can control are your own. If it bothers you that much to see them go NC and live your best life.", "Comparison is the thief of joy.\n\nYou need to focus on what makes you happy and work towards your own goals.", "NTA but there is nothing you can do about the situation.  If your dad and stepsister are happy enough with the situation, it will continue.  I do know how you feel. My youngest sister - YS and my brother OB (who was the oldest) lived with our mom, rent free. My older sister OS and I moved out and married.  The living arrangements of my YB, OB, and mom were none of my business nor that of OS. However, what bothered OS and I was the fact that, when mom needed help, she would call on OS or I.  I and my family ended up taking care of her garden and lawn when they got over grown, despite the two capable adults living with her. OS and her daughters also stepped in when YS and OB were useless.  When my mom needed the carpets and couch replaced, OS and I paid for it but OB did as well.  Now, OB and mom have passed.  Os and I ended up taking YS to court over her dragging her feet settling OB's estate (she ended up as executor as they both lived in the same state, same house).  It has been over 5 years. YS tells everyone that we (OS and I) are money hungry. Ironic..", "NTA. My dad has done this with me. I had to figure everything out on my own since I was 17, and he coddles my step siblings.  Nothing you can do about a sibling getting better treatment than you. If you are being excluded to that extent just go low contact, and focus on healing that resentment. Holding onto that will only hurt yourself in the end.", "YTA - your sister has done absolutely nothing to earn your resentment. (And let's be honest, the actual feeling you're experiencing here is jealousy because your sister has it easy.)\n\nWhen your parents divorced, they and the court decided where the children would go and if and how much support would be paid. When your dad re-married, that had nothing to do with his prior family. It sounds like they are still married and those children have the choice to live with them or move out if they want to.\n\nIf you are angry that your dad is footing a holiday to Australia for your step sister and not you, the person you should be angry with is your dad. You need to address this with your dad. Not your stepmother. And certainly not your step-siblings who, like you, didn't ask to be put into this situation.", "You need to remove yourself from this situation that has stolen your peace of mind. Stay by recognizing you have no control over your father and his family, that your resentment is harming you not them.  Go NC for a while and concentrate on improving your life. Good luck!\n\nNTA", "YTA. You\u2019re jealous. How your step sister lives is none of your business. If dad and step-mom are cool with it, there\u2019s nothing wrong. You can talk to your dad and explain your struggle, then request some kind of assistance, but it\u2019s not owed to you. \n\nIt sucks that you were put in a difficult situation and had to move out at 18, but it sounds like you also could\u2019ve asked your dad for help years ago.", "INFO why couldn\u2019t you move in with your dad at 18?", "NTA for saying what needs to be said about someone who sounds appeased and enabled. \n\nSilly to waste your energy on the other stuff though. An alternative way of looking at it from your point of view is that your situation has given you the drive to do better for yourself. Your step sister will never have that.", "YTA but only to yourself. You're letting this chew you up inside when you could be taking the high road and seeing it completely different. So she lives at home still and has no ambition to leave. You have been out since 18, meaning you have no doubt more experience in things than her, you've no doubt worked a little harder to get where you are, and you're more prepared for things that come up than she is. \n\nI had a spine injury 7 years ago and it always bothered me that other people somehow made it through decades of life without any major injury or setbacks, but then I realized that if I can get through this on my own and get back on track, I feel better equipped for shit like that then them. It was a nicer feeling than resentment, I'll tell you that much. Covid hit, and everyone struggled, while I happily cruised through no problem,  walk in the park. I already experienced all the isolation and lack of work and pain involved. Same with your case. If she ever finds herself having to live on her own, she won't be nearly as equipped as you are to handle that shit.", "YTA- literally not your business, not even a little bit. Sounds like she has a job and both her and dad are happy with the arrangement. I get it sucks to feel like someone else has it better than you, but comparing your life to others is never a good idea. You\u2019re both grown adults, stop resenting her and focus on your own life", "ESH, unfortunately.\n\nWhile you have no business telling someone else what they should and shouldn't do in their home, your resentment is understandable because your father clearly doesn't treat you as well as his stepchildren.  However, this resentment is misplaced.  Your stepsister hasn't done anything wrong; she's simply making use of the advantages she's been given.  Your father (and to some extent your stepmother) should be the target of your resentment.  He could have taken you in at 18 when you were struggling to make it on your own.  He could have offered help with living expenses, vacations, etc.  He chose not to.\n\nSeek therapy and maybe go low contact with your father for a while.  Distance and professional counseling will help you resolve your feelings of resentment and put your family situation into perspective.", "YTA - I know it sucks, but there might be a real reason she's unwilling to move out. I moved back home and stayed with my parents for several years because I was experiencing suicidal ideation and didn't trust myself to alone. Maybe she's saving money. Life isn't fair for any person. You have struggles. She has struggles. But this situation isn't any of your business.\n\nTherapy is a great way to vent out your feelings of resentment and obtain a neutral perspective on events.", "YTA, your feelings are totally valid, but it\u2019s not up to you what your dad does with his stepdaughter, maybe tell him you would like to take a trip", "YTA, your resentment is misplaced. Your anger should be towards your father for being so unfair in the treatment of his children. Your stepsister is not responsible for your dad being a shit father to you.", "You're anger is towards your parents and not your SS. Which I can understand btw. It feels like your dad took better care of his Stepkids then he took care of his own kids. Just don't make your SS the bad guy ;)", "Yes. Let it go. None of your business.  Have a good day.", "YTA. Life isn't fair sometimes.", "YTA.  It has nothing to do with you. Get therapy for your resentment.", "ESH \n\nYour father clearly played favorites when you were kids, and chose his step-kids over his biological kids. Resentment is a natural response. \n\nYour step-sister is a moocher who can\u2019t or won\u2019t grow up. Living free off parents at that age is pretty pathetic. \n\nBut you are an adult as well. While I understand your resentment, how they now live their life isn\u2019t really your business. I sympathize, as I had a shitty father who made my teen years pretty terrible. But rehashing childhood favoritism isn\u2019t good at this point. It\u2019s also not the step-sibling\u2019s fault.", "YTA - Get some therapy to get some peace of mind and cut contact.", "Soft YTA. It's not your step sister's fault she's had an easier life than you, so you can't blame her for it. Try to think of it like this: instead of being jealous, you should pity her. She's like an animal raised in captivity. When some hardship comes along (and into each life some rain must fall), she won't be prepared to deal with it because she's been pampered. You will.", "Soft YTA - your resentment is against the wrong person.  None of this is your step-sister's fault.  Where was your dad in all of this?  Why didn't he take you on vacation as well?  Your definitely entitled to some resentment, but it belongs with your dad.  \n\nI don't often suggest therapy on here, but i think in your case it might be really helpful for you to enable you to figure out what you need to do to let go of the resentment and be OK.  I'm sorry you've had to deal with this - it sounds like a rough way to have grown up, seeing the obvious discrepancies between your life and your step-sister's life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
