I was sitting in economy for a 1.5 hour flight around 11am. There was a family (mom, dad, young kid) in front of my wife and I. \n\n1st event: The mom and young kid immediately and with force reclined their seats into us. The mom forced the kid to recline their seat even though the kid was 4 years old at most and was not even using the recline. The mom gave me nasty looks because when she forcefully reclined her seat, it slammed into my knees and probably hurt her back. We did not say/do anything and just kept to ourselves\n\n2nd event: the kid was kicking the guys seat in front repeatedly. Not just innocent kicking, but pounding on the seat. \n\n3rd event: the kid was watching movies with no headphones on the flight. The kid continued to do this until a flight attendant noticed and told them that they needed headphones. The mom was angry at the flight attendent. \n\n4th event: The mom was complaining she was cold or something so the dad stood up and turned off the air that the people in front of them were using. He did not ask them. I thought this was very rude. \n\n5th event: the kid/ mom started to reach back and close our window shade. It was daytime and no sun was directly shining in. Most people had their window shades open. We reopened it about 3 times in a row because we had paid for a window seat and wanted to look out the window as we were flying over somewhere new with cool landscape. After the 4th time, the mom turned around and got mad at us for keeping it open stating that her kid needed to sleep. We told her it was our window and would be keeping it open. We told her she could un-recline her kids seat and the window would no longer be in her eyes as the seat would block it. She did not do this and was very angry with us. \n\nNote- the kid fell asleep anyway. \n\nI think that this was the rudest people I\u2019ve encountered on a flight and I probably would have put down the window if events 1-4 had not happened. So AITA for not putting down my window shade?", "created_utc": 1682445853, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yr03o/aita_for_not_letting_the_family_in_front_of_me/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've got four kids, and that kind of behaviour is just ridiculous. I can't imagine being that entitled.", "NTA! These people are the kind of nasty family that leaves a slime of misery in their path wherever the go. Good for you for standing up to them.", "NTA- not her window\u2026didn\u2019t even ask\u2026she\u2019s the ah", "NTA\n\nThose were the nightmare people to sit near during my travel years for work. Fortunately, my flights were either super early or super late, so I avoided the casual travelers for the most part.", "NTA. People like that should be bumped off flights.", "NTA. I wouldn't have been so nice. It's people like this that give decent families with small kids a bad reputation.", "NTA I\u2019d have started something", "NTA -  \n\n\nWith teh exception of the reclining seat (which they are allowed to do) You should have called the flight attendant on every other violation.   You paid for your window seat, the people in the seats ahead of you ahve no claim on it.", "NTA. They acted like total A. You did not.

There are some ridiculously entitled people flying these days. I had a direct flight from San Diego to Fort Lauderdale a couple weeks ago that was an absolute nightmare because a woman flew with her six kids, and she sat in first class by herself and left the kids in economy at the back of the plane. The oldest kid was about 14 and the other five kids were all 10 years old and under. Youngest was maybe 3. The 14 year old was trying to manage them but it was absolute shit show, and the flight attendants were ripping their hair out for 5 hours. Absolutely insane.", "I was 90% sure I wasn\u2019t but just wanted to double check and be able to tell the story of this family.", "The only thing I wouldn't fault them for is reclining their seat (I think the seat reclining debate is ridiculous - if it's such an issue they wouldn't recline in the first place and if you're mad about the tight space, blame the airline) but doing so *forcefully* is an AH move. Everything else is super entitled and rude of them. NTA", "On a 1.5 hr flight? In the middle of the day? For a 4 year old? Absolutely unnecessary", " The best-case scenario the people in front of you don't recline and you do - I'm convinced that's the source of the debate.", "Yeah also to add that the 4 year old was laying across the mom\u2019s lap. Not even using the recline. I think the mom had the 4 year old recline purely to be rude. She did this before the window shade incident too.", "That's fair. \n\nI'm just arguing (for those people who think *anyone* reclining their seat as being the height of rudeness)... reclining seats exist. You can use them. Even 1.5 hours can be a long time for someone with back issues, leg cramps, etc..", "Ugh have had that happen on long flights before. Or people that leave the seat fully reclined for the entire flight, even when they are going to the bathroom or sitting up to eat or whatever. I hate it so much.", "yeah, i think you should be aware and polite when reclining but airplane seats recline. you know when you book your seat that most of the seats are gonna recline and that if you are tall, it's gonna be uncomfortable.\n\nthat's flying....and why i'm glad i'm short.", "I do not understand why the seats have that extra cushion at the top that pushes your head forward. \n\nNo matter what neck pillow I bring, it can\u2019t combat the angle of that thing. It gives me excruciating back pain unless I can recline a bit.", "I think at some heights it works- I'm fine. But i could see the issue.\n\nI have that problem in my mom's car. I'm at the exact wrong height but the difference is that i can remove the head rest. (which is fine as long as we don't get into an accident.)"]}
