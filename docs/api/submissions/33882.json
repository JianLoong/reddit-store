On two separate occasions before Christmas I offered to help with the cost of the food and making the food with the agreement that we wouldn\u2019t buy elaborate gifts for everyone. His mother said \u201cNo, I want presents\u201d each time and proceeded to tell me all the things I needed to purchase for her. So, we bought gifts as usual and didn\u2019t think anything of the dinner. Now my husband is super bummed.

He says it\u2019s a lot of food and is making me feel pretty greedy, when I thought he would be appreciative and excited since he was so disappointed before.

My husband says I\u2019m being a jerk for keeping all that food but I don\u2019t want to give it away. His family will destroy it in minutes and there will be nothing left. They had a regular ham from the grocery store for Christmas and have leftovers they can eat. He says they will share anything with us and we should do the same and I simply don\u2019t agree.

It sucks he wasn't more appreciative. You only even got the ham because you felt bad his mother didn't offer one the one he likes at dinner. To quote another comment: no good deed goes unpunished.", "NAH. But I get you, I see you, I respect you. BUT No Assholes. He is appreciated and excited but, and I think this is true of all ham lovers, a ham is alot of ham. With excitement of ham sometimes come the dread of ham, which can be never ending. An entire hunk of like 99% edible salted, sugared meat. And if you don't eat 90% of it, you feel like a monster. Cause you can save it, hell alot of hams have been smoked/cured that you could just toss it in a pillow case and just hang in your kitchen seemingly indefinitely. \n\nPlease don't let this cause any dischord and also realize that your probably taken aback at the \"no I want my presents and heres a list\" AND you still had to get that ham (which isn't cheap).", "NTA\n\nIs this what your husband is often like when it comes to his family or is this a one off?\n\nThe reality is that this has soured the experience for you.  You wanted to surprise your husband and have him enjoy this ham with you... but he's now made you feel bad about it.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you care much for honey baked ham and don't care whether you have it again.\n\nIf this is going to make things uncomfortable, then I'd just share the ham with his family and never, ever do anything like this again.  Your husband can organise his own ham if his mother doesn't provide it at Christmas any more.", "This is his family tradition and you are basically telling him you don\u2019t care about it", "NTA\n\nHoney Baked Hams are amazing!  \n\nYou are not an AH for not sharing.  If I purchase a HBH, i bring it home, we eat a few meals, and I freeze a bunch.  We use the bone for soup.  We pull out ham pieces for a couple of months.", "Ok. What are you supposed to *do* with this ham, exactly? Buy the ham, disassemble it, \nand wrap three or four slices in foil for all the people your husband wants to share it with? And then spend your afternoon driving around to everybody\u2019s house, to knock on their door, hand them the ham package and tell the recipient that - here! :) Your husband wanted them to have it?  \n\nHere is an idea. Cancel the ham and see what, (*much*), smaller options the Honey Baked Ham store has. I bet you could persuade them to sell you a few slices. My ham store sells sandwiches-there is an online menu of options! Or maybe their smallest party platter would give your husband his ham fix without breaking the bank and you having half a ham cluttering up your freezer for who knows how many months.\n\nNTA This should have been simple and sweet. Your husband and his mother had to make this difficult.", "NTA. \u201cYour mother made it clear she wanted gifts instead of ham. I gave her what she wanted. You\u2019ve got no reason to be pissy with me over that.\u201d", "NTA. No his family doesn't need the majority of your $100 fancy ham after the holiday is over. What a ridiculous request. You dont support them. This is exactly why freezers were invented. Eat your ham dinner, then have ham sandwiches for lunch. The next day make split pea soup and scalloped potatoes and ham. You how have 6 fancy ham meals instead of one.\n\nI may be a little harsh - I've dated a couple of guys who tried to strip my kitchen during the holidays and hand out the food I've slaved over to make themselves look good. They'd leave me with zero leftovers and load up some random friend. I just can't cater to this behaviour anymore.", "NAH but your husband is putting you in a difficult situation. If you share with his mom, that\u2019s the new normal now. You\u2019re the one in charge of buying a ham, forever. \n\nIMHO you should agree to share the ham \u2013 it was a gift for him and that\u2019s how he wants to use it \u2013 but you need to have a real talk with your husband about his mom being ungrateful and taking advantage of you, and you\u2019re not interested in buying her presents from her personal wish list anymore, since that\u2019s the part that really seems to be bothering you.", "HBH does sell a half ham, and you could ask if they have a bone from the sandwiches they make. That would solve it.", "NTA and the real pigs in this story are the ingrate hubby and greedy in laws", "NTA. Gee, you'd think your husband would be happy that he's getting his special ham. Instead he is calling you names and being ungrateful.", "NTA. His mom cheaped out on food, refused your help and asked for gifts. That's what she got. Why is your husband now saying in addition to accommodating his mother like that, you should also have contributed the ham? You were supposed to feed at least nine people in addition to what you did? I don't know what a ham costs but it's your money you spent, and I don't know why your husband thinks he should be telling you how you should have spent it.", "Nta wow with his attitude it'd be going to a food bank.  He's bitching that you didn't do a nice enough thing?  Then never fucking mind. His fingers aren't broken, he can order his own.", "NTA\n\n  \nWhy didn't HE buy one for his family.", "You offered to help MIL and she declined so this is for you and your hubby to enjoy", "No good deed goes unpunished....  I think you are NTA, but I don't think your husband is the AH for being thoughtful.  It's kind of gift for him, so I think you should not get too bent out of shape if he wants to share it with others.  I would be thinking twice about making a similar gesture in the future though.  This would annoy the heck out of me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
