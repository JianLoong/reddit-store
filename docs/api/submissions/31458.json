Last year when his brother got engaged he didn't invite me or any other friends to the ceremony (rituals) here in India we have rituals for everything. At that, I was a little upset that he didn't even bother to invite me once, and even his brother asked me why didn't I go to his celebration. I told him directly that I was not invited, and then he told me that I was his family and I should have come. After listening to those words my heart became heavy so I told my bf about this and how I was sad and he should have told me once. \nThen this year my bf, one day told me that his family went to his sister-in-law's house to decide about the date for the wedding. I was happy to hear about it. I asked him about the date and he told me it's on the 23rd Nov. That's it. \nHe told me the days he'll be taking leave and the flight tickets are pricey at this time because of festivals. I even ordered two shirts for him to wear in the ceremonies. \nIt's a 3-day wedding so, suddenly on 20th Nov he asked me when I be there for the ceremonies. I asked him what he was talking about. As he never asked me to come and we never discussed anything about my going. Or he never even sent me the invitation. \nThen he told me that he was inviting me that day. I just laughed and told him I would not be going, as I have exam duty. \nAnd he told me I'm childish and I'm taking it too far. He expected me to be there and he wanted me to buy something for his sister-in-law, etc etc.\nSo am I the AH?", "created_utc": 1700595068, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180p7ya/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_i_wont_be/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I dont know why people always feel so entitled at weddings. take time for yourself and always prioritize you. you\u2019re not a convenience", "NTA - He needs to get his priorities straight. He involved you to shop for him and share various aspects of his personal travel, expenses, etc. for the wedding but never asked you. What an insult! Three days to get time off,  prepare yourself for a 3 day ceremony/celebration, buy tickets, etc. is not OK. It is more of an insult than not asking you at all. It sounds like he wants to be able to say, \"I invited her but she declined.\"....3rd crazy insult.\n\nYeah, you are not a priority when you look at his actions and lack of words. He calls you childish...who's the child? Be sure the brother who asked about your past absence is told the truth. Do not let your lack of attendance favor the BF. If this is your future spouse he literally needs to get his sh\\*t together or is this a connection of convenience?!", "so your bf planned this wedding trip without you and then a couple days before, acted as if you were supposed to know that you'd be going? that's absurd.\n\nwhy are you with him? he sounds exhausting.\n\nNTA. don't have kids with this guy.", "NTA - If you didn't get a direct invitation, you weren't invited. Those are the rules I've always lived with. No one has a blanket invite.", "NTA. I would have just told him, \"Its like you leave yourself the freedom to exclude me and then you want me to act like I can't see this game you play?\n\n\"If you want me there you have to include me from the jump. Just because people are giving you static about leaving me out of things is not my responsibility to correct like I need to soothe your conscience or make you look good? This is never about problems with the calendar. This is about problems with your choices. This behavior isn't working out for *you.* So, change your approach next time. So, from now on, if you want me - you have to actually say so well ahead of time. I am not hanging around waiting for you to invite me to a playdate. This is hurtful. So just stop acting like its not.\"", "Nta", "Nta. You've been dating him for over 7 years and he treats you like an after thought? And you stay?!?! Why?\n\nWhy are you not treated with respect and dignity? Why do you do everything for him and let him walk all over you and call you childish? \n\nTake the time away from each other to really think about what you get from and give to this relationship. \n\nGood luck", "Yeah you could have had a conversation with him about this before it was too late.  He made an assumption.  You are being a martyr.\n\nESH", "I've had this issue with a birthday.\n\nI'm close friends with a close cousin of my partner (just bf at the time). We were friends before we met (we actually met through his cousin). There was a year in which he invited family over to lunch for his birthday and the friends to spend the afternoon. I was never extended the invitation for the lunch. Unlike you I discussed it with my boyfriend but neither of us knew if I was supposed to go and neither wanted to ask. So I didn't go.\n\nTheir family blew up on them. My friend/his cousin because how he could have forgotten and my boyfriend because how could there be any doubts, I'm his gf so I'm family, period. From that day forward I don't need an invite. If one of us is invited we know the other one is as well.\n\nHere you made two errors:\n\n1. You didn't discuss this writh your boyfriend. You have been dating for 7 years and you couldn't have a single conversation on whether or not you were supposed to go? You need to learn to communicate\n2. His brother directly told you that you're family, meaning you're automatically invited. So how you could have thought you were not invited is beyond me.\n\nYTA", "The phone works both ways, you know. \n\nYou knew he wanted you to come, you knew the date, you knew that you were invited as your BF\u2019s partner and they expected you there, and your BF had told you all the plans of what he\u2019d done so you can join or make your own. He\u2019s initiated conversation about the wedding many times. Maybe he made assumptions, but they were assumptions been pretty communicative about; there were many opportunities you you to raise your concerns or to ask question - *you* are the one who chose to not speak up.  \n\nYou\u2019re really looking for excuses to martyr yourself here.

He is not thinking about you, you are not a priority, and it is disrespectful to invite you to something that important at the last minute.  Extremely poor communication on his part.", "At this point, I don't know anything about the future. It's exhausting. Is it a conversation that I should have initiated although it's his brother who is getting married? I don't think so that's why I didn't ask him anything. He regularly talked to his mother about the wedding's progress but he never once asked me about my plans. Will I be able to get leave from my work or anything. NEVER. So what's the point?", "Breaking up on the spot might have been you taking things too far. But telling him you aren't going through the nonsense anymore isn't.", "she wasn't invited either time. why should SHE have had a conversation? the bf should have informed her of what was going on. she's not psychic and she's certainly not a martyr.", "That's because he knew that I was so sad about the engagement thing and told him at times at least he should have told me. And this is the wedding, don't you think he should have taken the initiative to at least ask me once? And he hadn't officially introduced me to his family yet. They just knew about me through friends and talked to his brother over the phone. And if I were to go to his place have to stay for 2 days and for that, I have to explain this to my parents. So without the invitation what will I show my parents?", "her bf deliberately excludes her and somehow SHE'S the ah?\n\nthat's absurd.", "A Martyr and Excuse Seeker?  -- No\n\nWhat partner talks about an event, asks her to order him clothing specific to different aspects of the wedding...yada, yada and does not ask her to attend. He knows she will have to secure time off from work, secure special clothing of her own (it is very festive), participate which I've seen can be through dancing with other women or attending a women's only gathering the wedding week. He was to ask her then typically his parents invite her verbally and she receives an invite.\n\nYes. She needs to be asked and in many locations minimally should receive an official written invite confirms she is welcome (and please respond).", "how were you supposed to know any of this when no-one told you anything? no. it was his responsibility to invite you - not your responsibility to ask if you were invited. wtf?\n\ndon't let him trick you into thinking he's right. he's 100% wrong. and he clearly doesn't value you or your experience.", "She should have asked because of the conversation she had with the brother.  If she wanted to go she should have clarified.  This is a little thing we call communication.  It would have prevented this problem.", "His brother, the groom, invited you. You were clearly invited. You need a piece of paper to show your parents? Why?\n\nAgain, you need to learn how to communicate with your boyfriend. These type of games belong in highschool, not to 20+ yo people.", "Her BF told her she was wanted there. The groom has told her she\u2019s wanted there. Her BF told her the date. Her BF told her his travel plans. She was even involved in getting BF the clothes he needed. Her BF and his family HAVE been communicative. They have not been excluding her. If she needs more information, it\u2019s on her to say what she needs in order to come. There is a wedding being planned, and that means there is a LOT to preoccupy the groom\u2019s family. The groom is not a mind reader. Boyfriends are not mind readers. They are not going to know the OP has an issue unless she speaks up.\n\nOP is being difficult instead of communicating clearly about her concerns or what\u2019s stopping her from joining the wedding she knows she\u2019s invited to. It\u2019s her choice to not speak further. They have been dating for 7 years; its petty and AH of her to play HS testing-you games instead of just talk.", "Her receiving an written invitation to attend a wedding is the bare minimum to fulfill an 'invitation'. He did not ask her and no formal invite arrived. This is how many families in different regions communicate...OP does not have a communication problem. \n\nHe even failed to show her his invitation which can be quite complex and detailed outlining details of a 3-day wedding process, ceremony, celebration, accommodations, etc. Some wedding weeks have a day (8-hours) where only the women attending the wedding attend. It is joyful, often includes henna at the bride's parents' house (or else where).", "He asked me about that after the engagement. And for the wedding, the groom Didn't call me or invite me personally. And my bf also didn't tell me once to go to the wedding. So this is not some high-school game this is about self respect. Period.", "\u201cYou\u2019re wanted there\u201d =/= an invitation.", "He asked you why you didn't go to the engagement party because you're family and should haven been there. It's obvious the same thing applies to the wedding.\n\nWhen I talk about playing games is with your boyfriend not with his brother. You didn't ask me directly to go with you so I'll just be here in my corner and not mention it until you do, instead of having a conversation with you like an adult. This is HS games."]}
