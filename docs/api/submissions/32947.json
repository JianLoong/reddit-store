It\u2019s their money to spend how they want. However I also see why your wife is upset.\n\nSecond everyone telling you to not let them spoil your daughter. Tell them if they can\u2019t do for one then don\u2019t do for either. The problem with that is your daughter is 14. If you draw this ultimatium and your family stops doing things. Your daughter will resent you, your wife and your stepson. She will blame the 3 of you for having to leave her school. For how the quality of her life \nChanged.  And the first chance she get she will run far and fast away from you. \n\nSo there is no easy fix her. I honestly do not know how to approach this. Either you let things ride and your stepson and wife will resent you, your daughter and your family for the favortism. Or you put a stop to it and have your daughter and family resent you, your wife and your stepson. This action will cause you to loose your child. By not taking this action you could loose your wife.\n\nMy advice figure which person you are willing to have resent you and you can leave with pushing away. But changing your sibling\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t an option.\n\nSometime life isn\u2019t about being worried about being the asshole. Sometimes life is about choosing the lesser of 2 evils. Or in this case deciding what you can live with or without.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re right - it\u2019s their money and their choice.  Shes looking a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nIf she wants her son to get better gifts, she\u2019s free to beef up his presents herself.", "NTA. They are related to your daughter. Not to your stepson. Whereas you may have obligations towards him because you have agreed to having them, the same isn't the case for your brother and sister. Your wife is the AH for pushing her son in front of her into a conflict of her own making. You should nip this in the bud.", "Many people here have different view on step-relationships.  I guarantee if you posted this on the r/stepparent the consensus would be this is quite normal.", "My inclination is NTA because I've seen attempts to make things equal seriously backfire. Your family has been in your daughter's life the entire time, and it's not their responsibility to show the same affection to a teenager they've only known for a few years.", "Going against the grain: NAH\n\nYou and your wife have an obligation to treat your kids the same.  Your brother and sister don't. They aren't obligated to also pay for his schooling, to also buy him expensive gifts, to also throw him parties.  That's on you and wife.\n\nI get that your wife and stepson are upset, but that's not your siblings' problem to solve.\n\nIf you want to keep the peace, then tell your siblings to stop giving your daughter gifts and stop paying for her school.\n\n\"I had to sleep on the couch last night\"\n\nBS.  If she's upset, she can leave the room.", "Nta, and where is the stepsons father?\n\n Your brother and sister are of no relation to your stepson and your wife is acting very entitled. If she can't afford things for her son and if you're treating him like a son and not just the stepson and the sister gets better items guess what it's your brother's money like you said.\n\nAs for the kicking you out of the bed, a friend of mine did the best thing ever, when he and his wife bought a house he let her decorate everything except the guest room. He took that for himself to decorate. He bought a big TV a nice desk for the computer and extra comfortable bed and everything he liked. So the few times his wife gets mad and kicks him out of the bed he goes to the guest room even when she says to sleep on the couch. And that bed is even more comfortable than his regular bed.", "We're missing some information here...like how long your wife and stepson have been in the picture. Is your daughter both you and your wife's, or is she from another relationship?\n\nI see in the comments something about 'a few years'...and if that's the case then no, your siblings cannot be expected to gift something as expensive as a PS5 to your stepson.", "NTA. My brother has a bunch of kids with different women, a couple of whom have children from previous relationships, and when they were together I would buy the step kids and my nephews gifts of equal value but that was my choice. If I wanted to spend nothing on them then that\u2019s my choice too\u2026. I mean I couldn\u2019t treat a kid like that, but some people can. Sucks for the stepson.", "NAH the only people who have the obligation to treat your child and stepchild the same are you and your spouse.", "NTA. Your brother and sister have known and loved your daughter her entire life. It sounds like your stepson only entered the picture around 3 years ago. He\u2019s a kid they barely know and their gifts are appropriate. Your wife is delusional, and quite frankly sounds a little greedy. Her siblings/family can buy her son bigger gifts, if they choose to do so.", "This is a really complicated problem, because no matter what you do somebody is going to resent somebody else long term. It feels gross that your family so openly lavishes your daughter. But at the same time, TECHNICALLY (what redditors love the most \ud83d\ude44) they can use their money any way they want. You could be more compassionate with your wife and stepson.\n\nRather than saying \u201cthey can do what they want with their money\u201d, phrase it \u201cI know it\u2019s unfair but I can\u2019t tell them how to spend their money\u201d. YTA for not caring about how your ***literal wife and child, your chosen partner and family,*** feel about this disparity. TBH you and your siblings come across as cold to people you consider outsiders, and the way you\u2019re calling your wife entitled definitely comes across as treating her like an outsider. You\u2019re a FAMILY.\n\nIf it were me, I\u2019d tell your siblings that wanting to do things like help your daughter with school, that\u2019s ok (it\u2019ll help you with being able to afford your stepson\u2019s education in the near future), but to keep the really expensive gifts to a minimum - UNLESS they are willing to sit down with your kids and explain to them, face to face, exactly why they do what they do. If anyone should be resented for unfair treatment it should be your siblings, as they are the actual cause.", "Have you asked your siblings why there is such a big difference in gifts? Did your stepson do something to offend them? I understand where your wife is coming from. If the roles were reversed how would you feel? If someone was singling out one of my children I would ask them about it. It sounds like you haven\u2019t, which is why your wife is rightfully upset.", "INFO:\n\n- did you adopt your stepson? I guess not since you call him stepson...\n- where is your SSs dad and why does he or his family not give your SS the same treatment like your family gives your daughter?\n\nImo a stepkid usually has another parent, or if the other parent is dead there is still the family of this parent. So its their job to give gifts etc. As long the stepkid still has 2 biofamilies to support them, then in this case your daughter and SS has the same amount of biofamilies and there is no reason why the family of the stepparent is responsible for fair treatment.\n\n Now, if your SS has no biofamily from father side (all dead, i do not accept \"dad and his family are not in the picture\") and also has no other family on moms side than mom herself, it would be shitty of your family to treat him this way, bc he has no chance of ever getting a good gift like your daughter. It tells \"too bad your family is dead, but that is your problem, we don't care\". If SSs family are just AHs, its your wifes job to make sure they treat him better. \n\nJust put on your SSs shoe for a second and see from his point of view if you would feel treated unfair, considering all family situations and circumstances, bc in the end, its him who suffers.", "Bro, u gotta chill. It's their money and they can do what they want with it. Plus, a book and shirt are decent gifts, don't be ungrateful. Maybe try talking to your fam about how you feel instead of just calling them out on Reddit? Just a thought...", "NTA- And stop letting your wife banish you from your bed. It's pathetic.", "NTA.  Your stepson will sense the unfairness.  This will harden his heart and make him more ambitious, ruthless, and cunning as he grows older.  He will learn he must take what he wants, rather than wait for it to be given to him.  When your stepson takes his place on the Iron Throne and all others bend the knee, you can be proud for your part in his success.", "NTA for some of it but yeah, giving her a PS5 for her birthday and him a shirt and a book is kind of shitty of them. I'd ask them to keep the public gift giving occasions a little more equitable, but obviously if your daughter is thriving in private school, etc. it'd be detrimental to her to ask for all that to stop too.", "[deleted]", "Yeah.  YTA.  \n\nHow can you not comprehend the inequity?\n\nIs it a coincidence that you don't see a problem because it's your STEPson that they are not favouring?  Don't think so.", "I think your family just dislike your stepson", "Judging from your responses, I can't help but go with YTA in this scenario. \n\n>I don't think they care enough about him to have any kind of feelings toward him. For them he is just a random kid\n\nThis was one of your response to another comment and it seems to sum it up. It looks like you also don't care enough for him to have any kind of feelings toward him and see him as just a random kid living in your house. You keep saying you can't force your siblings to treat him the same way as your daughter which is true but you can certainly ask them to show a little bit more love toward him.", "YTA. Your brother and sisters are AH, too. Rude and disrespectful as well. \n\nMy wife came with my daughter from a previous marriage. The house rule when the girls were growing up was that the only steps in our home were on the stairs. I adopted my daughter on her request. \n\nI can't believe that you would allow this to happen to a young man during his impressionable years. YTA", "Based on some of your responses, specifically the fact that your brother & sister have been financially supportive of your daughter for her whole life and that you\u2019ve only been married to your current wife for three years, I\u2019ll vote ESH. \n\nBlended families are challenging enough for the nuclear family. I can see why you\u2019d want to just give up on managing the extended families. But, it\u2019s your responsibility to do that, and it doesn\u2019t really sound like you\u2019ve even tried. It\u2019s obvious why your brother and sister would be close with your daughter, but have you even given your son an opportunity to get close to them?\n\nHowever, your wife is also abdicating her responsibility in this situation as well. Has she tried to create opportunities for your son to bond with his aunt & uncle? Where is her family in all of this? Does she have opportunities to earn more money that could be used specifically to fund activities for your son? Ultimately, she needs to accept that she can\u2019t control what other people do, and that not everything can or even should be equal.", "YTA!  \nYour comments about your poor stepson are so cold and uncaring. You too clearly see him as 'some kid you met a few years ago.'", "Your wife is feeling upset for your son, that he isn't considered a part of the family. Why don't you send him to live with his dad, since you don't have much regard for him.\nYour wife demanding a party and gifts from family is wrong. But you're failing as a husband by not advocating for your son. It's not ther obligation for them to pay anything, but you could tell them he's your son and it hurts that they treat him with indifference, like he doesn't matter", "YTA.. do you claim the stepson as your child if so you need to set that boundary that he is your child and treat him as one.. I had thus problem with my parents and her parents gift favoring.. I told them both that they need to be fair as if they are their grandkids or we would stop inviting them to events.. my partner agrees with my view.. \n\nIt takes a village to raise a child\n\nSuper sad that people say just because they aren't blood they don't deserve something.. sad we push division between ourselves.. the comments stating that it isn't their family need to reflect on what it means to be a true person..", "[deleted]", "YTA, that\u2019s your son now. Drop the step.  You don\u2019t have the right to demand they get him equal gifts but you can stand up for him. Show him that you care. In the end it doesn\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t get him equal stuff, it matters that you show him you care.", "Edit:\n\nNTA-\n\nIf your stepson had been in your family his whole life that would be a different issue, but he hasn\u2019t know these people for very long and cannot expect to be getting the same extravagant gifts as his stepsister is from the family she\u2019s always known.And you said she was already at private school prior to the marriage so that makes sense. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, but I do think you and your family should communicate more. It sounds like you\u2019re not a team but rather a mom and a son living with a father and a daughter. \n\nYour stepson has every right to feel jealous and even a little hurt towards all of this but your wife really can\u2019t expect so much from them. You married her and her son, your siblings didn\u2019t. So I agree they should choose what they do with their money. \n\nAll of that being said, I assume you have been in your stepsons life longer than you\u2019ve been married and you hopefully care about him, so maybe work with your wife to see how you can make him feel important too, otherwise he may resent all of you.

What if your step son had loaded family and your side was dirt poor or absent? Would you be happy seeing him get tuition, and cash, and opportunities, while your daughter got a cheap book and forgotten? Or would that be like eating tacks and every incident would build more and more resentment?\n\nIt's great your daughter gets all this extra stuff, but you should at least take *some* measures to ensure parity. Like, you should be putting caps on the gift amounts. Something like birthdays and holidays only and no more than $50/100 seems fair. Or they can take her to lunch, but can't just give her wads of cash for lunch. If they normally gift her a shopping spree for new school clothes at the start of the year, then anticipate that happening and set a little cash aside throughout the year so stepson can likewise go on a trip to the mall, even if it isn't as extravagant.\n\nTuition is trickier, and you should be bending backwards to ensure your step son's education doesn't suffer from lack of opportunities.

As cold as the world wants to be these days, the last place that coldness should extend for any kid is their own home. Maybe a good move would be to treat your kids like the intelligent individuals they probably are, and communicate with them. Ask your step son how he actually feels about it, and talk to him about where you're coming from. Then talk to your daughter the same way. Come to an understanding between everyone.

She has two older half siblings who aren't related to me, and I'm not particularly close to the dad.

Talk to the daughter how the situation is unfair to her step brother, and explain to her how thankful she should be (and not entitled) to have this opportunity in life. Encourage her to share her better gifts with her brother. Explain to the step son that you are on his side but ultimately can't control what others do. Communication is key here.\n\nI hope you read this, OP. I know of plenty of mixed family situations where step kids resent their step parent (and eventually siblings and parents as well) over feeling like they're second-class siblings.

Sure, they're not blood relatives, but they're still family. \n\nWhen you get married, your partner's family joins yours and vice-versa, so the stepson is his responsibility also, meaning it's up to him to ensure the kid also gets treated as family by his relatives. Of course, he can't decide what his siblings do with their money, and asking for money for the party is crass, as they'd be asking for more money. But he can ask for the daughter not to get preferential treatment. \"I understand you're willing to invest in Daughter, and we're very thankful. But it's also important that we teach our children about sharing and equality of opportunities. We love them both equally, and we'd want them both to have the same opportunities in life, and we don't want any resentment between them. As such, we'd prefer we received your support as a family, and we divide it equally between both children. Of course, your entirely within your rights to help as you see fit and we won't begrudge you if you prefer to only support Daughter.\"\n\nHaving this conversation would mean OP is doing right by both children and may help mitigate any potential issues between the stepsiblings over the daughter getting more chances in life than the son.\n\nBtw, the different levels of gifts are just petty.
