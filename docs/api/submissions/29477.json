You definitely struck a nerve with the inconsiderate on here, OP. Well done!", "I mean, if someone is raised somewhat alright, they should be able to get their sh*t and throw it in the trashcan.

Or, point out that no that isn't actually part of the service (which is why there are huge trash bins outside each theater room) and next people watching the movie has to sit in his nasty pile, next time bring your mommy if you can't be a proper man and drop your trash in the bin on the way out. Basically, people like that only understand basics and have to be treated as such, to feel stupid and humiliated in order to consider any possibility of change, and even that will only work if actually kind people learn how to kindly be unkind to retrain gross people. Also way NTA, OP. At least you tried.", "I don\u2019t get it. Did you make an announcement to the whole cinema that they should clean up? Why did you pick this one guy?

The employees have a very short amount of time to clean up the theatre and have to wait for every guest to leave before they can start. If everyone leaves during the credits cleaning can start during the credits. This is ALSO why people should help by throwing out their trash. If not a lot of seats are sold it's usually fine, but if it's a sold out show (especially a kids movie, and sometimes these showings are in multiple auditoriums at the same time) it can be really challenging to clean in time for the next showing. There were times where we essentially had to just pick up the big stuff that was left behind and then sweep any messes on the floors under the seats and hope for the best.", "Good on ya, mate. We need more Larry Davids calling people out.", ">those lights illuminate what you would think was a prison food fight\n\nExactly.
