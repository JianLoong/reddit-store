They turned to a vegan lifestyle about 6 months ago, which I have nothing against, but ever since then they've just been harassing me about animal cruelty and how I'm a carnist and I advocate for animal suffering and that I should convert to veganism like they did.\n\nI've been very, very clear to them that I will not be changing my lifestyle. I'm sorry, but I just don't have the willpower. I love meat. I love fish. And I support my friend 100% in their choice, but it feels like all they talk about now is the mistreatment of animals, \"big beef corporations\", the evils of the dairy industry, etc. Of course I was interested in it at first, but pretty much every conversation we have, they manage to sneak being vegan into it.\n\nHowever, I've never told them to stop talking about it; I would feel pretty guilty to be honest, especially when their intent is just to do better for the planet. But they're honestly making me feel like shit to the point where I kinda would rather be elsewhere every single time.\n\n**Now to the actual point of the story:** A couple days ago me and friend were walking to the grassy area at our college together and I've been pretty stressed out because of finals, so suffice to say I wasn't feeling particularly sociable. I was drinking an iced coffee with dairy creamer and they went off about the dairy and cow industry as well as how these corporations contribute to climate change through methane and whatnot-something I've heard about a thousand times from them already. I remained silent until I snapped, turned to them and said,\n\n\"you need to learn to ***shut the fuck up*** sometimes,\" in a pretty harsh tone, and then I speedwalked away. I felt pretty bad about this a couple hours later, and texted them:\n\n\"hey, I'm sorry about how I snapped at you, I've just been under a lot of stress lately and I shouldn't have said that to you.\"\n\nThey responded with \"how could you hurt me like that?\" and then blocked me. They're refusing to tallk to me or work anything out, and it's been 4 days. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: All my friend talks about now is veganism. I was having a rough day and told them to shut the fuck up about it. AITA for snapping at them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: this friend is a man. So many people in the comments refer to him as a \"she\", which I find pretty interesting. Are more women than men vegans?
