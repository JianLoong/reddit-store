We may make out sometimes and have a child together, but sharing toothbrushes is too far.", "NTA... tooth brushes are used to remove plaque (bacteria) off of your teeth. If one person has the bacteria that causes cavities in their mouth, this is a great way to share it. It's not the same as swapping spit. (That has some of the same risk)", "I'm ok with the packing arrangement because I am 100% sure if I let him do the packing he would forget half the stuff we need, that is why I'm more comfortable doing it myself. If he forgets his stuff it doesn't affect me and he can figure it out. Agree that he needs to grow up and take things seriously, we already had a conversation about it.", "That's the thing, to him it wasn't so obvious and I had to explain it. Unbelievable, but we talked it out and everything is fine. Good to know I'm not the only one who thinks sharing a toothbrush is disgusting.", "Gross is exactly the word I had in mind. NTA.", ">because I am 100% sure if I let him do the packing he would forget half the stuff we need\n\nLook up \"weaponized incompetence\". He's training you to perform all of the labor in your relationship by pretending to be shit at it. I guarantee he doesn't drop the ball on similar tasks at work. \n\n>If he forgets his stuff it doesn't affect me\n\nExcept it does because then he just uses your stuff without even asking you. \n\nHe DOES NOT RESPECT you.\n\nDon't fall into this trap, hon. It's a lifetime of miserable servitude. You deserve FAR better than this.\n\n>we already had a conversation about it.\n\nI hope the conversation went \"Next time you're packing us entirely for the trip or the relationship is over.\" Because anything short of that is doing a huge disservice to yourself.", "Definitely something to think about. We haven't had problems like this before, we've been together for 3 years and our relationship is pretty balanced in terms of chores. I genuinely want to believe this was a one off and he will respect that going forward. Thanks for your advice, I'll definitely keep it mind if there is a next time.", ">our relationship is pretty balanced in terms of chores\n\nBalanced in terms of doing chores but you have to figure what chores need to be done, remind him to do his, sometimes redo them? Or actually balanced so that you share the burden of planning and organising as well?\n\nMany men of my experience think they're pulling their weight if they do whatever their partner asks them to, but expect to receive instructions and given a to-do list."]}
