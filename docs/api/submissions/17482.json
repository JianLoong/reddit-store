What in the weird \u201cWe\u2019re wed so we are one\u201d gross ass mindset.

We may make out sometimes and have a child together, but sharing toothbrushes is too far.", "NTA... tooth brushes are used to remove plaque (bacteria) off of your teeth. If one person has the bacteria that causes cavities in their mouth, this is a great way to share it. It's not the same as swapping spit. (That has some of the same risk)", "I'm ok with the packing arrangement because I am 100% sure if I let him do the packing he would forget half the stuff we need, that is why I'm more comfortable doing it myself. If he forgets his stuff it doesn't affect me and he can figure it out. Agree that he needs to grow up and take things seriously, we already had a conversation about it.", "That's the thing, to him it wasn't so obvious and I had to explain it. Unbelievable, but we talked it out and everything is fine. Good to know I'm not the only one who thinks sharing a toothbrush is disgusting.", "Gross is exactly the word I had in mind. NTA.", ">because I am 100% sure if I let him do the packing he would forget half the stuff we need\n\nLook up \"weaponized incompetence\". He's training you to perform all of the labor in your relationship by pretending to be shit at it. I guarantee he doesn't drop the ball on similar tasks at work. \n\n>If he forgets his stuff it doesn't affect me\n\nExcept it does because then he just uses your stuff without even asking you. \n\nHe DOES NOT RESPECT you.\n\nDon't fall into this trap, hon. It's a lifetime of miserable servitude. You deserve FAR better than this.\n\n>we already had a conversation about it.\n\nI hope the conversation went \"Next time you're packing us entirely for the trip or the relationship is over.\" Because anything short of that is doing a huge disservice to yourself.", "Definitely something to think about. We haven't had problems like this before, we've been together for 3 years and our relationship is pretty balanced in terms of chores. I genuinely want to believe this was a one off and he will respect that going forward. Thanks for your advice, I'll definitely keep it mind if there is a next time.", ">our relationship is pretty balanced in terms of chores\n\nBalanced in terms of doing chores but you have to figure what chores need to be done, remind him to do his, sometimes redo them? Or actually balanced so that you share the burden of planning and organising as well?\n\nMany men of my experience think they're pulling their weight if they do whatever their partner asks them to, but expect to receive instructions and given a to-do list.", "If anyone used my toothbrush they would be needing a set of brand new dentures.\n\nAnything that didn't escalate to that level - you are kind and generous.

My husband and I have had the same battle.  The dollar store has 4 pack toothbrushes.  I just pack one of those each time.", "NTA, he can put toothpaste on his finger and use it.", "NTA. This is a simple problem to remedy.", "NTA. I know we all swap spit and are very intimate with our partners but something about sharing a toothbrush with my bf just grosses me out so i completely understand", "NTA. Your boyfriend is a monster. Who uses someone else's tooth brush? That's just gross. Huge difference between swapping spit and swapping food particles.", "NTA\n\n>I ultimately asked him to stop using it, \n\nThat would have been his toothbrush at that point because I am not willingly using a toothbrush that was all up in someone else's mouth. Even if I kiss that mouth every day,", "NTA\n\nhe could have bought a new toothbrush, honestly.  \nAnd no matter the logic, normally you ASK before grabbing a thing your partner owns and using it as if it was yours.", "NTA \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\nAre you dating my ex? The second time I caught him using my toothbrush (after I repeatedly asked him not to), he tried to convince me that I am overreacting using the same logic of sharing body fluids.\nThat was one of the many reasons we're not together anymore.", "My husband and I have been married 26 years (today is actually our anniversary) and guess how many times we've used the others toothbrush? ZERO because that's just gross. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. Using someone else\u2019s toothbrush is so gross. I don\u2019t care how clean of a person you/he is. It\u2019s still gross and (to me) it\u2019s violating your personal, private space. I would be FURIOUS. It just feels like such a violation.", "NTA. Besides the cherry on top of having someone who can't handle an argument without calling you unreasonable and saying you're overreacting, using a toothbrush should be something you explicitly give permission for. Just like you already *consent* to sharing bodily fluids, this is a case where consent is important. It's a hygiene product! Of course you might have qualms about sharing it, just like you may not want to make out with someone when they have a dirty mouth.", "Ewwwww NTA", "NTA\n\nOh HELL no. That\u2019s nasty.", "Ewwwww. NTA", "Agreed. NTA. I learned from this as a child. He should know better.", "What\u2019s obvious to one person is not always obvious to another person.  It may have been just as \u201cobvious\u201d to him that one can just their partner\u2019s toothbrush, or towel, or drink out of the same water bottle without asking because that was the mentality that he had with his family and/or close friends.  And, it would have been puzzling to him that you were upset over this when he would have been completely nonchalant about if if the situation were reversed.  \n\nAlthough I agree with you and most others in this thread that a toothbrush is not like drinking out of the same bottle or even sharing a towel, I am a big fan of always talking it out and simply exchanging your \u201cperspectives\u201d rather than making normative statements like \u201cthat\u2019s so disgusting\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s so weird that you could even think that because everyone else would agree with me\u201d.  After all, what matters is that you don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing a toothbrush and that your boyfriend respect YOUR perspective, whether it is common (as it was in this case) or something relatively uncommon (for example, you are a germaphobe), and vice versa.  There\u2019s no need to get into whether the other person is a weirdo or grew up in an inferior culture.", "Also add on anything you forget that we need to buy will be coming out of your wallet not mine aka you forget the sheets he pays but also still pays for his half of items on the trip too like eating out and activities", "I wouldn't immediately jump to weaponized incompetence, OP. \n\nNot to conflate the issue, let me say this first. Using you toothbrush is a boundary issue for sure.  \n\nBack to the packing, some people are just bad at it. They will run off and leave half of everything even if they are just packing for themselves. They will just deal with it on the trip or end up buying replacements. I take care of the packing in my relationship too and its ok that some people are better than others at packing. My husband did that a couple times and then I took over packing for him. He never asked but I was tired of having to buy extra things and having multiples of the same item. Weirdly my ADHD brain is great at packing just not making it all to the car, Husband handles loading the car.", "I don't think this is a one off", "Exactly this. He is terrible at packing so I choose to take care of it myself (and actually enjoy it, I love packing) except for his personal belongings like the damn toothbrush lol. On the other hand I'm a terrible cook so he cooks all of our meals, we are ok with that distribution.", "Bodily fluids, yes, accurate. Plaque and god knows what that\u2019s been marinating between your teeth for hours is worse. So much worse. Ask him if he thinks it\u2019d be gross to share a single piece of dental floss, because it\u2019s as gross as that would be. You are NTA.\n\nI\u2019ll share a straw with my husband, not a toothbrush. Boundaries are healthy.", "NTA, G R O S S, G R O S S, yes, yes, yes a mess G R O S S \ud83e\udd38\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Absolutely NTA. That\u2019s nasty. I had a roommate that would use my toothbrush, so I used it to clean the toilet to make them stop", "NTA\n\nI have been married for over 15 years and have kids.... Everyone in my house has their own toothbrush.", "Also, cavities are contagious.", "Gonna say NTA, though I was considering NAH. Look, I do agree with him. If you have a fairly close physical relationship there is nothing going to be on the toothbrush that you haven't already shared with each other. And theoretically there shouldn't be any living germs left on the toothbrush since it is the job of the toothpaste to kill them, and then it all gets rinsed clean afterwards anyway. But ultimately it is your toothbrush and your right to set the boundaries that you are comfortable with. It sounds like him saying you overreacted was more of a defensive thing, you said you \"lost it\" and said he was unsanitary and gross. No one is going to like that. He did agree to stop doing the thing you were not alright with though, and sounds like he would have done that with a calm \"that is absolutely not ok\" as well. The only reason I go with NTA instead of NAH is because he didn't ask prior to using it, he just assumed.", "NTA and omg nasty!!", "NTA. That's absolutely disgusting. \ud83e\udd22", "NTA.  I've been married since the dinosaurs walked. If my husband used my toothbrush, that puppy would be in the trash, and he would get his butt chewed.", "NTA your boyfriend is gross and needs to stop being a cheap ass.", "He can make a list. He's an adult. On the \"things I need to bring\" I would think a toothbrush is the highest priority.", "NTA\u2026 but can\u2019t help but chuckle at all the \u201cgross\u201d responses.  Most you all will put each other\u2019s genitals in your mouths (and more), yet the thought of a toothbrush is over the top.  Funny how we compartmentalize certain things!", "Disgusting.\n\nBuy a multi-pack of toothbrushes and keep them in the closet for the BF.", "Ewww that's gross...I'd throw out all your personal stuff or hide it...thst loofah in the shower...burn it", "NTA.  Get a new boyfriend.  People like that don\u2019t change.  He will never respect you or your boundaries"]}
