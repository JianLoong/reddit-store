She said her rent was too much, and I agreed to pay an additional $50/month because I considered us friends and wanted to live with her/help her out. Anytime Lucy bought something for the house (decor stuff) she made us pay her back without consulting us beforehand. Other roommate thought this was ridiculous so I ended up paying Lucy bc I wanted to keep the peace. \n\nShe was extremely passive aggressive to me. She told me I \u201cnever cleaned\u201d (not true), made \u201cjokes\u201d to other roommate about how I \u201conly leave my room for food\u201d and about my dating life, and complained it was my fault we lived in this house and she had the worst bedroom (I found the house on Zillow but we all agreed to live here, and she had the lowest budget so got the smallest room, not sure why that is my fault). \n\nI got the memo that she didn\u2019t really like me and we weren\u2019t friends. I was friendly around the house but we didn\u2019t talk otherwise. \n\nOne day she texted me accusing my cat of \u201cdestroying\u201d a bunch of her stuff, and I needed to reimburse her. I was upset bc she had never said anything before and I had no idea (Other roommate did not have any complaints about cat). When I looked at the \u201cdestroyed\u201d items they weren\u2019t damaged, and some were in a spot my cat couldn\u2019t physically reach. Think fabric bins from Target that have a minuscule thread sticking out but look new (owed her $40 bc she \u201csaw him scratching them\u201d), and a yoga mat with a pin sized hole that she said he scratched. I was so fed up from everything else with her we got into a huge argument and I told her she clearly didn\u2019t like me. She \u201chad no idea\u201d why I thought that. \n\nI moved my cat to my parents house and reimbursed her $150 (she continued to use all the \u201cdestroyed\u201d items for the rest of the lease). I never reached out and neither did she. \n\nIt ruined our friend group, and a lot of people are mad at me. People wanted me to apologize for getting mad at her, but after all her nasty comments and paying her $150, then $600 in extra rent I wasn\u2019t going to apologize. \n\nTLDR; got in an argument with friend/roommate and didn\u2019t apologize.", "created_utc": 1669729850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7un3k/aita_for_not_apologizing_to_former_friendroommate/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like she is just a miserable person. She also caught on that you are a people pleaser and would pay up instead of argue. You didn\u2019t ruin any friendship. She did.

She was always going to escalate until she destroyed your friendship. Now she'll pick another target and start the whole process over again.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA.

A con. Who cares even why. Thank the goddesses you are no longer friends with her. They\u2019ll all learn sooner or later because that\u2019s obviously just who she is. Good for you, find better people and bin them even faster if they act the same way next time. There\u2019s 1 billion better people out there you get to be friends with. Never feel bad about getting rid of toxic ones. She was a waste of your time, don\u2019t waste anymore of your time, feelings or thinking on her.", "NTA  \n\nYou are better off without such a person in your life.\n\nBUT, take a lesson from this:\n\nYou allowed her to walk all over you.  You were weak for not standing up for yourself.  Stop it.\n\nYou need to learn how to actually be strong enough so people accuse you (with better reason) of being an asshole.  If no one ever complains about you you are probably a pushover.", "NTA but why in the hell did you pay her? \n\nConsider this a lesson, she kept pushing you because your other roommate made it very clear she wasn't going to fall for it. It's nice to be nice, but there is a limit to what a person should expect, and if she was willing to cross it that's when you need boundaries in place. \n\nBut don't feel bad OP, it's a rite of passage that at least one of your early living situations will be rubbish and you'll have to learn to stand up for yourself.
