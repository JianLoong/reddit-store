Emily is getting married early next year and I don't want to be part of it. Kate kicked me out of the house last week due to an argument that she and Emily instigated. I was told I'm not allowed to talk back because they are older in which I said \"in that case, you can slap me and I'm not allowed to defend myself\" Kate got offended by this and started screaming and swearing at me to leave the house, so I did. \n\nThat's just some basic context of what happened which lead me to decide to move abroad, something I have always wanted to do but was often shut down by my mum. I am in the process of securing a job, and thought of sitting down with my family to say \"I'm moving out, I will be missing the wedding and I don't want to be part of it. You can't change my mind and everything is already done. I'm just letting you know so that I can physically exit the house\" however knowing my family I know this will end up in a very emotionally manipulative argument, where things like \"do you not care about your family\" and \"you're being selfish\" will be thrown about, from past experience. \n\nI feel like the asshole if I don't tell them at all or until the last couple of days before my flight because it ruins wedding plans. Things like dresses need to be bought and so far I haven't been going with them to find dresses (in which my auntie texted me asking \"don't you want to see your sister happy\") because I'm not in the right head space. I want my own freedom and independence but my family is making it really difficult, essentially saying I would be a selfish asshole if I wasn't part of my sister's wedding. \n\nBut at the same time, it's my life so why can't I choose to not be part of her wedding? Why must she have me present? I get I'm her sister by blood but I've passed my breaking point and I just want to leave the toxic environment. Everyone is saying she is hurt by my absence but no one is really thinking of me and how I was hurt when I got kicked out of the house lol.

You\u2019re mad at how your sisters have treated you and want to \u201cget even\u201d by skipping the wedding. That burns a bridge forever, and maybe you\u2019re ok with that. At the end of the day, you\u2019re leaving and that\u2019s winning for you. Attending the wedding or not is immaterial to you winning. \n\nI am happy for you and hopefully working abroad goes well. Make sure the work is vetted, they have a website, you can see other employees and can talk to them first. There are some groups that lie to young women about jobs overseas, and please be safe.", "GO abroad.   Make a life for yourself.\n\nDO not tell your family anything.  They will sabotage your plans.\n\nYou have been the punching bag for your older sisters, and your mother, all your life.  You need to leave to create a (mentally) healthy, better  life for yourself.\n\nOnce abroad and settled, I would stay NC with your family.  They will guilt your or attempt to visit you and ruin what you have built.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nTry to move out without warning them, for example when they are all out of the house. Leave a note. Because as you say, warning them in advance will cause a world of pain.\n\nIf you have to pretend you're coming to the wedding, so be it.  Lie. Say you have a dress on order.", "ESH.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to live abroad, to make a decision to miss one of the key days in your sisters life, you\u2019re probably ready to own your decision by saying it out loud to your family.\n\nOf course they will push back. You\u2019re choosing, (arbitrarily, right? In theory you could start this job 3 days after her wedding?) to miss a key day in your sister\u2019s life. This absence will always be remembered, while whatever fight you had last Wednesday and what an awful cow she was then will not. \n\nBut, you can simply tell your sister you\u2019re not attending her wedding and to figure out her plans accordingly. If you don\u2019t, then you are putting a big expensive day in jeopardy with a lie of omission. Money will be spent on the dress, she might want a matching number of bridesmaids and groomsmen and will need to find a replacement, etc. You can tell her this regardless of moving abroad if you just don\u2019t want to be a part of this event. \n\nJust be sure to think both of these things through. Both choosing to miss a major life event and moving abroad are not decisions to be made lightly. Make sure you have a cool head when decide to do this and communicate it.", "pffff a 24 year ols telling a 21 year old not to talk back because she is older, what a riot haha.\n\nbut in more serious terms, what you should do is write a letter and leave it when you leave. dont allow for manipulation, dont allow them to hold you back. noone gives a shit about you, they just pretend so they dont have to face their terrible morals towards you.\n\nto semi quote your mom: its your life so their opinions dont matter.\n\nNTA op, stand strong", "NTA but ensure you have all important papers and anything sentimental secured away from them where they cannot access in anyway before you decide also make sure they do not have any way to access your bank some people don\u2019t remember their parents have those settings still on", "I am really worried for you. Seriously worried that your connections to live abroad are not legitimate. Some people take advantage of prople who are unhappy, troubled, and want to escape their homes. People who have no worries are also manipulated. Think human trafficking, prostitution, forced labor, and other things. Please do not go, I do not think this is a good idea, it is ok to move out but why don't you move out and stay in your own town or country first?", "NTA OP.  In fact,  move UP your plans if you can, so they don\u2019t have any chance whatsoever to try and manipulate you.", "NTA for not attending the wedding, etc. You didn't tell everything which is perfectly fine. If you feel your family is toxic and that you aren't contributing to the toxicity in any way, and that your relationships with your family members are irreparable, then go for your dream. HOWEVER\n\nYTA, if you leave without telling them. You should at least be adult about it and confront the situation. Let them know you want to tell them something and you want it to be a civil conversion. Tell them you're moving and tell them why.  Making people worry when you disappear is not cool. Or leaving a note like you're a 15 year old running away is not mature.

You should live your life the way you want to. But you don't have to leave your country to \"get away\" from your family. All you have to do is move out of their house and establish some healthy boundaries. Don't just flee in reaction to their actions - go because you want to start a life there.", "I went to the recruiters office on Wednesday and took the tests.  Spent Thursday filling out my enlistment papers.  Recruiter went home with me to get my mom's signature which she gave.  Picked my up Friday morning and took me to the AFEES station.  I was in boot camp that night.\n\nNTA", "I'll echo choices have consequences. You're still super young. Relationships evolve and your 20s are pretty special for most people. I didn't get a long with my sister then either. Now she's a true friend. We allied against our mom. Turns out when we all moved out we realize was manipulating us against each other and forgave each other. It's a relationship I wouldn't trade for anything but it took time to get there. If you are adult enough to move abroad then you are adult enough to handle the situation before you go. Plus, with cell phones and social media you're gonna have to deal with the fallout anyways so not really escaping much there.\n\n With regards to the wedding, you don't have to go, but you're effectively ending that relationship. You've only been alive for 21 years you have 3 to 4 times that left in this life. It's a long time, and alot of BS to get through without family. If you find anything remotely redeemable about them, go to the wedding or at least have the guts to have an adult conversation with the bride alone about missing it to secure your job abroad and promise to send her an awesome wedding present from a foreign country once you get established.\n\n You don't really become who you're ment to be till you get out on your own. That goes for your sisters as well. Be cautious about throwing away your whole family over petty shit that happened at 21. You may not get them back and it gets lonely out there.", "NTA just go.", "Sounds a little bit like my family. I have been telling myself I should have left at the first chance I got, instead of dragging it out to so many years after.\n\nNTA. You don't owe them any notice or explanation or even a note.

Make sure you have all your documents in hand and do what feels best.\n\nNTA", "This is a great response. Both considering the long term consequences of missing the wedding and making sure she\u2019s not getting into a bad situation with this job.", "This, don\u2019t give them a chance to prevent you from leaving.", "OP, what u/hastpine has suggested might well be the most important advise you receive. \n\nYou owe your toxic family nothing. Go and live your best life. Good luck.", "I'm going through a government backed route. My own country is expensive and I don't make enough to move by myself whereas I will be given housing with the work abroad programme", "This. There is nothing to discuss."]}
