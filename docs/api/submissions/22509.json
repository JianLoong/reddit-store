But Recently I have started building resentment for how I was raised and how she treats me as a 26 year old adult. \n\nGrowing up, she has always been overly strict and involved. Here are just some examples\n\n- Contacting all my teachers throughout high school \n- Setting up appointments for me and not telling me how to do it since I was on my parents insurance. \n- Called up my psychiatrist before hand and told them my issues @ 21\n- Would call me at college in the morning, and if I didn\u2019t answer (because I was sleeping) she\u2019d call my friends. \n- Would routinely go through my bedroom in high school and check if I was \u201cup to no good\u201d (look under my mattress, ect.) \n\nNow as an adult, she insists on doing everything for me. I\u2019ll admit, I used to like it, but now it\u2019s getting to be too much.  \nShe packs and washes out my lunches for work, folds my laundry, and is overly invested in my day to day life. I want to move out, but I feel like I have no life skills. I\u2019m slowly trying to learn, and my girlfriend is kind enough to help me with basic things like getting insurance quotes and medical insurance. \n\nWhen I get home from work , I\u2019m tired and sweaty. She runs out the room to talk to me. I go home and use the bathroom, and she will stand at the door trying to have a conversation with me. When I ask if it can wait, she gets overly offended and thinks I\u2019m giving her an attitude. \n\nIf I leave my bedroom door open, she\u2019ll stand by the door and watch me do simple tasks. Like if I\u2019m looking for something, she\u2019ll say \u201clet me help you find it\u201d \n\nThe other day, I went to get some routine blood work.

As someone who grew up with helicopter parents, the best thing you can do for yourself is move out. It completely changed my life for the better. Things like doing laundry and cooking was a lot easier than I expected, and there's a YouTube for almost everything. Right now you are chosing to live with her. Move out and be more independent! You can do it!", "NTA for wanting to be an adult, but you can't just \"declare\" it in your childhood bedroom and act like that should change her behavior.  Start doing your own laundry, packing your own lunches, and looking for your own place to live.", "ESH, except GF. You and mom are in a co-dependent relationship. The reason I am saying ESH is you said you used to like it. The vibe I am getting is you were fine with her doing everything for you until it started interfering with your growing need for independence. \n\nIt is past time to untie the apron strings. If you want her to start treating you like an adult, start becoming one. Start taking over responsibility for your life and doing the things adults do. You can start small, wash and fold your own clothes.", "Move out. Stop *trying* to be an adult and become one once and for all.\n\nI understand the feeling and is reasonable but things that come out when we say them out of frustration to our family (mom with good intention) will hurt people.

You NEED to move out. I feel bad for your GF because I bet that her \"teaching\" you to do those basic things is going to be her taking your mom's place and you will be just expecting her to do them for you.

Move out move out move out. This is ridiculous behavior- both for a parent and for a 26 year old. \n\nIf you can use the internet, make your own money, and manage to pay your bills on time you can move out.

With that kind of mother? (With ANY kind of mother?)

Good luck!!", "If you've never spoken to her about it and just threw this at her YTA. If this has comes after multiple attempts to ask for her help preparing to leave home and backing off then still TA but I understand the frustration. \n\nIt's time to do some growing up. First step, own your shit. A lot of people leave home with zero adulting experience and get by just fine. Even the most prepared f*ck up from time to time. We're all learning our way as we go. \n\nGo apologise to your Mum for not having the conversation you should have had. Ask her to help you prepare to leave home if possible. Find a place to live. Give notice and leave home. Search engine the hell out of how to do things, it's unlikely you'll be the first to ask.\n\n If she won't back down, leave anyway and be smart about your arrangements to do so (don't tell her which companies you're using/set passwords on your accounts). Once you've left the only way she has control is if you give it to her.\n\nYouve got this.", "Nta. Look up infantalization. Parents should teach you to do these tasks on your own and encourage you to do so.  \n\nYou are going to have to take the initiative to a)get outta that house and b) learn to do these things yourself. \n\nBeen there myself. It sucks. But the good news is there's tons of resources on the internet to help you.", "YTA. move out", "I'm going with NTA with a caveat.  \n\n\nYou can't blame your mother for your lack of skills. It's unfortunate that she's been managing everything for you and you haven't had a chance to learn certain life skills, but you can't blame her. A lot of people would have found a way to cut the umbilical cord by now and the fact that you have either been expecting or tolerating this help for so long means you and no one else has found it acceptable.  \n\n\nYour mother has no boundaries, and it sounds like the only way you're going to get the skills you need to live independently is by moving out and living independently. I would be beyond freaked out if my mom was hovering in the doorway talking to me while I was trying to shit. This isn't normal behavior toward an adult child.   \n\n\nI think if you're not going to be moving out soon, you need to try to communicate realistically about how you need the space to mature and learn life skills. Maybe start any conversation concerning these issues by expressing appreciation toward her and all she does for you, but then describe the actual obstacles you're facing, like, I'm an adult, and I should have my own insurance card. It's embarrassing to be a 26 year old man and not be able to xxxx. What I need from you is encouragement to develop independence. I love you and really do appreciate all the things you do for me, but... Unless you want me to be a momma's boy instead of an adult, then I'm going to have to xxx. I would love it if you would respect me enough to trust me to xyz.", "NTA\n\nBut this isn't about one incident, it's about a lifetime of helicopter parenting and that's tough.\n\nI think waiting for you mom to back off to learn how to do things/gain some independence is the wrong way to go. Start doing things on your own even if it means doing them *wrong* (or slowly, or inefficiently, or not as well as your mom does them). It really easy to let someone take care of everything when they always have and are eager to but someone has to break this pattern eventually and it sounds like it needs to be you.\n\nThe \"my house my rules\" has limits. You're an adult and deserve to be treated as one. But you had a right to privacy as a teenager too. It's pretty obvious that your mom is struggling to see you as anything other than her baby.\n\nIt might take moving out for your mom to really get that. Don't wait until you feel like you're ready though. One of the biggest struggles for kids of helicopter parents is that they don't know how to handle not knowing how to do things or what happens when they fail (speaking from experience here). Unfortunately the only way to learn some things is by doing. Luckily you live in a world with the internet which has incredible resources to help you.\n\nYou can acknowledge that your mom is motivated by love and wants to protect you while also acknowledging that her approach is actively harming you.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou live with her.  If you do not like it, move.  You can blame all this on her, but making a doctors appointment isn't rocket science, I am sure with the advent of the internet you could figure it out.  Same goes for her making lunch, doing laundry ETC.  You could do those things as well.", "ESH. Grow up.", "NTA and you need to get out on your own.  Find some room mates or something.\n\nYour mom\u2019s job was and still is to raise an adult capable of functioning and contributing to society.  She is doing things to make her feel relevant not to support your wings.  Moms, especially ones who have stayed home with the kid(s), have a hard time adjusting to not being needed the same way.", "YTA for sure on this. You mom is doing what Mom's do. If you have a problem with her behavior then move out of the house.
