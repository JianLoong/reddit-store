It really easy to let someone take care of everything when they always have and are eager to but someone has to break this pattern eventually and it sounds like it needs to be you.\n\nThe \"my house my rules\" has limits.

Don't wait until you feel like you're ready though. One of the biggest struggles for kids of helicopter parents is that they don't know how to handle not knowing how to do things or what happens when they fail (speaking from experience here).
