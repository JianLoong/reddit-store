Really what you\u2019re raised with I think and also trauma/abuse concerns with mixed-gender treatment/ages. \n\nI\u2019ve travelled as a child/adult, not very often, with family and I\u2019ve shared rooms with my brother though we had our own beds. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird as we\u2019re close in age (20 months) and grew up pretty much sleeping on/near each other (like in the car we\u2019d be leaning on each other, little heads stacked on top), we\u2019re one M and one F. We\u2019ve often used each other as pillows even as adults while sitting on couches from time to time. I think it would be a bit annoying to sleep in the same bed (snores, blankets, gravity) but not a particular issue. Like, if you\u2019re that fussy stack some pillows in the middle, or you can do head-feat layouts. \n\nI think it\u2019s a bit unfair to expect that someone should get the floor because of their gender (my Dad piped in that you could always have the bed and them the floor), however with visiting extended family I\u2019ve been given the room with a fold out bed & locking door while my Dad & brother got the couch/inflatable mattress of the floor and that\u2019s definitely because of my gender and probably because of the vulnerability in that. I\u2019ve always locked the door when sleeping while visiting  extended family, but never locked it at home when sleeping (just closed door at most). \n\nThat said my comfort level is different when it comes to familial closeness (of immediate vs extended) and even within the same immediate family it\u2019s different - my Mom says there was a bit of a squick factor if it was her-my brother as an adult but completely fine with her-me as an adult, my Dad cheerfully reassured me that I would have the floor if it was him-me, lol. And  fortunately, I\u2019m not in a situation where sexual abuse/horrible things happened with immediate family.  It is too common of an occurrence though to not respect that some people have concerns, they\u2019re valid, and find any mixed-gendered proximity weird/uncomfortable.\n\nOne of my earliest memories is running to my parents room, climbing over my Dad to get to the middle between my parents to bunker down (poor him, unfortunately one foot hold on the climb over was the blanketed tender bits, a painful sleepy grunt is captured in my memories). My brother and I both did it from less than a year old until somewhere around 4/5 years old (we had our own rooms, we just escaped and wore them down - they did try to evict us for a bit, but apparently they gave up in face of persistence. Apparently we were very athletic and good at escaping cribs with vigor) and we often did it together (my Mom describes it as sleeping with a pile of puppies). As an older child/preteen I slept in my Mom\u2019s bed for a period (health/mental health, comfort seeking). \n\nObviously, my parents bed-sharing tolerance has changed as their children became grown adults, they share your Mom\u2019s sentiment on opposite-gender adult children, though they would be fine sharing same room. A lot of it is also just logistics (except my Dad we\u2019re all bigger people so it would be a bit uncomfortable/who would all fit). \n\nI think NAH as I think the sexism is unfair and you can be upset about that, but people are allowed to be uncomfortable and have boundaries, even with family.", "With your mom's reputation I think it'd be for the best if you slept on the floor.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nI would rather sleep on the floor.", "Would you think it weird if a 41 year old dad shared with his 19 year old daughter?

I highly doubt that\u2019s what she meant, probably more that it\u2019s just not a typical thing for a mom and son to sleep in bed together, but then the mention of having you sleep on the floor made you feel even more defensive. Sure, it sounds harsh, but it\u2019s also kinda like a partner asking a hypothetical scenario like \u201cif I was a different person would you love me?\u201d Hypothetically, it\u2019s weird to her and it sounds like y\u2019all have the means to not have to test it, so it\u2019s really a non-issue. But perhaps if you all had to sleep in one room and it came down to you being on the floor or sleeping in bed with her, especially if it was more than one night or a way of life for you all based on your means, she would say it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m not gonna make you sleep on the floor of course. Stakes feel way less when the conversation is hypothetical, especially if it bears little relation to your reality, but sometimes when someone answers based on that the other person feels very offended and hurt despite it basically being an imagination/play exercise that the \u201coffender\u201d may not have been thinking of in such severe/real terms. It\u2019s easy to think, \u201cwe\u2019re family, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d When you feel offended by the hypothetical boundary, but then you may feel it crosses your boundary for your sister to drink out of the same cup as you. Not because you think it is sinister or the same as making out or something serious like that, but because you just have an instinctive aversion to it. You May feel like, \u201cother animals sleep together and it\u2019s not weird at all. Why do we have to make it feel like something gross or strange?\u201d Sure, valid, but there are often complex reasons for individual boundaries that may not even be readily apparent to the person who has them, and taking it as a rejection and an offense isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere and doesn\u2019t ultimately serve the healthy relationship that you hope to have.
