My sister is currently in 4th grade and I am in my sophomore year of high school. My sister has a handed down phone, and she is almost on her phone and ipad 24/7. \n\nWhat really irked me was the fact every now and then my sister would post videos on tiktok about how \"her life is so hard\" and she thinks she is better than everyone. She has a pattern of being selfish and arrogant. I'll be honest, it is definitely my fault that I wasn't strict enough to the point she ended up like this. Yet no matter how much I've tried to talk to her about it she would roll her eyes. She would always complain about how \"elementary school is harder than high school\" and anything like that.\n\nBecause I'm getting busier with school since I'm in after school activities and AP classes, I can't really set a good example for my sister. I always try to when I have free time, but she stays in her room all day and she isn't even respectful to our parents. \n\nThere was this time where I also took her phone as a joke, holding it up in the air next to some stairs. She got mad and almost started crying while hitting me and yelling at me. I had taken her phone because it was time for dinner, and it's formalities for us to not have electronics at the dinner table (especially with elders). So I was still holding her phone, and then she did something I didn't think she would do. She pushed me down the stairs. JUST to get her phone. \n\nI was fine, since it wasn't that steep of stairs but our mom had heard what was going on and I didn't want my sister to get in trouble so I lied and said i tripped. She didn't even say thank you or anything, just said \"yeah she tripped\".\n\nSo on one day, my sister was really pissing me off. I was about to go to her room to tell her to take her vitamins, but i overheard her talking shit about me on call with her friends, saying how I was \"so annoying\" and \"i need to shut up\". I listened in the whole conversation until they hung up. Long story short, she talked shit about our parents and grandparents as well. So, I ended up just opening her door without knocking and started YELLING at her. Full on yelling, echoing through the whole house. \n\nI kept calling her an \"ungrateful brat\" and how she needs to appreciate what she has in life. Whenever she tried to speak I didn't let her, and by that time my parents were walking up the stairs already. By the time they reached upstairs, my sister was ugly sobbing as I kept yelling. My mom yelled at me saying \"I can't do that\" and \"I'm the oldest\". I didn't have the heart to yell back at my mom, so I listened to her yell at me as my sister cried. We haven't talked for about a week now. I've been told by my parents and grandparents that I'm an asshole for that, and I regret yelling at her. She is just a kid, and kids grow up and learn on their own time. \n\nAm I the asshole for yelling at my 9 year old sister?", "created_utc": 1691824238, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15oxmnd/aita_for_yelling_at_my_9_year_old_sister_and/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not a parent, and you need to stop acting like it. It's that simple.\n\nAlso ungrateful bitch vs brat is a big difference when it comes to describing a child. Don't call her a bitch.

She is your sister, not your daughter, so stop trying to correct her behaviour and leave it for your parents.\n\nShe is 9. They are generally really selfish and ungrateful, it's part of being 9. \n\nStop covering for her. If she pushed you down the stairs, tell your parents at the time. If she is rude to you or whatever, tell the people who can do something- your parents.", "ESH.  Your sister, for being ungrateful and rude. You, for acting like her mother and calling your sister nasty names. And especially your parents, for not parenting either of you, letting a 9 year old be able to be on social media at all.\n\nYou need to focus on just yourself for high school. Don't help your parents with things like giving vitamins; don't boss your sister around. Literally: just focus on you. You deserve better than this situation, and the best way is to do your best on your grades and extracurriculars. It's not your job to teach your sister manners, or anything else; that is your parents' job. For your own sanity, just ignore her at this point, especially if she's being rude to you. Shine on your own with your own stuff.\n\nI hope your sophomore year goes well!", "Esh. \nYour parents should be parenting her and monitoring her screen time. 9 is far too young to have that much freedom online. She needs to learn when it is and isn't appropriate to be on her phone and have impulse control. \nYou shouldn't have screamed at her or defended her when she pushed you down the stairs. That's dangerous and sociopathic. \nEveryone defending her saying she will learn in her own time means they're not taking responsibility for teaching her and that's what she needs. You are not her parent, if she doesn't come down for dinner let your parents deal with it.", "Your parents are going to have a lot of fun with your sister when she hits puberty. Try to get out of the house at 18, believe me", "NTA, but it\u2019s not your job to be her parent. It sounds like your parents are enabling this behaviour, especially by giving a 9 year old a phone and letting her use social media? That\u2019s insane to me. Your parents are ridiculous\n\nI think the other comments labelling you as TA are a bit extreme because they don\u2019t seem to be considering that the reason you\u2019re trying to parent your sister, is because your parents don\u2019t do their own job of parenting? But that would need additional information", "YTA.  She's only 9 years old and you're only 15 . Let your parents parent. It's not your job to police her.", "YTA \n\nIn your post it sounds like your parents aren't ever far off being that they made dinner and came running so quick all these times, why are you taking her discipline into your own hands? Of course she rolls her eyes and doesn't listen to you, you aren't her mom and if this is how you always act then it's no wonder she doesn't want to go places with you. You said you do a lot after school so you can't be the only one responsible for her so why are you making this your responsibility? In one comment you said you don't want her to have the same regrets you had at 9 years old, what is that fourth grade? I'm having a hard time figuring out if this is fake or if you're responding to something in your life that you're not mentioning here. It's not being a good sibling to take their personal belongings just because you don't like what they're doing with them. No it isn't right that she pushed you, but anyone who knows anything about kids would have probably been able to tell that she'd had enough of your shit. You clearly aren't recognizing your own behavior because you're still kind of a child in a way yourself. If you want to set a good example I would suggest minding your own business. Don't take charge of her life yourself, talk to your parents or speak to her like a person. If you just want to tell her she's wrong ask yourself \" Is this thing that bothers me physically or emotionally hurting her or others?\" If it isn't hurting someone then mind your business.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your job to bully your sister under the guise of \u201chelping\u201d her. It don\u2019t matter what you think; you don\u2019t get to make decisions for her or take things away. Leave the parenting to your parents and focus on yourself.", "YTA - you\u2019re describing some typical assholey sibling stuff (grabbing the phone to put it int be air and tease them). You say that after saying you\u2019re trying to set a good example for her. Wtf? You can\u2019t do both. The pushing down the stairs and lying has so many red flags. It mostly suggests you realize you were doing something fucked up to her, she had a fucked up response, and you tried to cover your own ass. \n\nShe makes some typical complaining nonsense that kids do. You invade her privacy. And then scream and yell at her. Yeah. YTA. \n\nWhat do you think you\u2019re teaching her this way? That you solve problems by screaming and shouting and yelling? Where do you think she gets the behavioural issues and tantrums and lying from exactly? \n\nThat is not how you teach anyone anything effectively. People do not learn when the relationship is bad. People need to feel cared for and loved before the parts of the brain responsible for learning (and gratitude and other things) can properly function. \n\nYep. You behaved like an asshole. The way you come across if like you\u2019re trying to parent her, rather than be a sister. And you\u2019re trying to parent her while having *none* of the skills and maturity and ability to do so. \n\nStop trying to parent her and start being a sister. You want her to have better behaviour? Model it.", "YTA. \n\n1) You aren't her mother. It's not your job to be \"strict\" with her. \n\n2) You are being judgmental for no reason. Who cares if she acts like school is so hard. Maybe, for her, school is hard. Maybe she's not as academic as you are, has more difficulty focusing, has worse teachers, etc. Or, maybe, she's just following the social trend on tik tok of whining. Etc. Just let your sister do her thing. If you believe she's doing something she shouldn't be doing, talk with your parents and let htem decide.\n\n3) You were teasing your sister to the point that she cried. Obviously you are a fucking asshole here.\n\n4) She is correct. You are being an annoying little shit.\n\nYTA. There's no question.", "ESH i think", "She is not your daughter. She is not your responsibility to raise. It is not your job to be strict with her. It is not your job to enforce rules with her. All of that is your parent's job. She doesn't respect you as a parent because you are not a parent. \n\nIt's your job to be in high school, which is really fucking hard. \n\nSoft yta for what you called her because I understand where you're coming from. The right way to handle this going forward is to apologize to her, even though it's going to suck.  If you feel like you need to, you can explain to your parents what you overheard and why you yelled. That ship may have sailed. But if it's still awkward at home, they may appreciate knowing. But be prepared for them to ask you why you didn't tell them sooner.  \n\nThen next time she pushes you down the stairs, or talks with disrespect, tell somebody.", "YTA - you're bullying your little sister, then wonder why she is the way she is, all under the disguise of calling it \"help\", while kind of forgetting that you're not her parent.\n\n>but i overheard her talking shit about me on call with her friends\n\nThe way you treat her it's no surprise she is venting to her friends. \n\n>I listened in the whole conversation until they hung up.\n\nWhy in the world are you invading her privacy?!

JUST to get her phone.\n\nI mean ... it was her phone and you was taking it away as a joke. You continued while she was mad and crying. That is called bullying. What did you expected he to do? Submissively pretty please please stop taking away my stuff and tease me? Wait till you get bored of it?\n\nFrankly, this situation is younger sibling standing up to bully older sibling. Demanding that victims takes only self defense measures that achieve nothing or blaming them when self defense is not perfect ... is still bullying.", "It's so fucking funny seeing everyone say \"you're not her mother\" or \"it's not your job to raise her\".\n\nShut the fuck up. \n\nI get told the complete opposite all the goddamn time. \n \n\nWhenever my siblings do something wrong, \n\"Why don't you teach them/punish them?\" \n\n\"Why do your parents have to do it?\"\n\n\"It's your job to be the bigger sister\"\n\n\nA lot of the times parents do jackshit and the elder siblings suffer for it. \n\nAnd then when they talk to their parents and ask them to step up and BE a parent, they get yelled at.\n\nSo no, NTA. I'm sorry you're an older sibling.\n\n\nEdit:  you said that \"kids grow up and learn on their own time\" \n\nHah, no they don't. They grow up to be older assholes of their younger selves. Someone needs to show them what's right and what's wrong.\n\n\nI'm sorry your parents are spineless enablers.", "YTA. Why the fuck are you trying to enforce the rules? That's the job of your parents.

Worry about your own business.", "NTA, I can't believe this is coming from a 9 year old. What is she going to like as a teenager?

You\u2019re also a child like your sister is which means you don\u2019t have the appropriate skills in order to navigate your sisters issues which she clearly is having some behavioral problems based off what you\u2019ve stated here.\n\nIf you feel as if you\u2019re parents aren\u2019t parenting like they should I would possibly go to your parents and express your concerns.\n\nI hope appropriate family dynamics are able to be established because the way the dynamic seems right now will most likely lead to problems in the future. Your sister will eventually get older and resent you acting like mom and not sister. \n\nOP this isn\u2019t a harsh criticism of you I more interested in your parents mindset in all of this. \n\nMy only harsh critique is the fact that you\u2019re downplaying what she may be struggling with just because you don\u2019t see it and or agree with it.

Honestly Opie you are still a teenager and you can advise your sister once in awhile but I feel like you should address this to your parents and let them know that if she continues to act like this then they will have themselves to blame and your hands will be clean because you're also a young kid trying to grow up and be responsible yourself. \n\nI don't blame you for being angry because you're Justified trying to stand up for your parents as well as your grandparents but I feel like a bit more tact would have suffice but I understand it was the Heat of the Moment; just remember that a word is enough for the wise and if your sister continue to act like this then you have nothing to blame yourself for it is just her and your parents that will receive the end results in life.\n\nNTA once again.", "I agree but I'm more oriented on ETA, she is a brat, you try to police her and take her phone, your mum turns a blind eye, and won't help her,", "NTA, it looks like the parent are not doing their job!", "my parents don't really have any time as my dad has to work and my mon has two other children to take care of, one being a baby. if i were to talk with my parents about this situation, they'd tell me \"why don't you handle it if it bothers you so much\". and for the third one, she literally pushed me down the stairs?", "yes, i understand I'm also young and i  don't understand life as well as my parents yet but my parents are really busy a lot of the time. my dad has work and my mom needs to take care of two other kids, and I'm scared my sister would end up regretting a lot of stuff like I did when I was 9. \n\ni have tried to express my concerns to my parents, but they dont really care and say \"if it bothers you so much then you fix it\". my parents are really nice people, and I hate to burden them like this. \n\ni have tried to act like a sister, offering her to go to fun places with me and saying i can take her to my festivals at high school, but she always says she doesn't want to. of course, i won't judge or have a say in her decision on that. all i can say is i've tried. \n\ni will apologize to my sister, and i dont know if she will even be able to forgive me and i'm scared for that. i need to own up to my own mistakes.", "OP holding the phone over the stairs is a glaring example of why she shouldn\u2019t be trying to parent her sister at all she\u2019s not mature enough because she\u2019s also a kid herself. \n\nI have stated a few times in this post that her parents also need to answer for some of this right now.", "Well, it seems like the parents are leaving it to the 15 year old to do the parenting!", "I have a 9yr old and she\u2019s busy playing with dolls. This child sounds like a nightmare and thinks she\u2019s older than she is.", "Sorry, but that's a pet peeve of mine. It's \"per se\", not \"per say\".", "If that\u2019s true sis is learning how to bully and violate privacy.  Real winning examples", "This is something your parents need to address not you this shouldn\u2019t be falling on you. I am sorry you feel like you\u2019re needing to step in.", "There's a thing called parentification.  It's where parents are not fulfilling their responsibilities and push those responsibilities on to an older sibling.  This is not a good thing.  It's admirable that you are helping them when they need it, but you shouldn't have to.  You shouldn't be so responsible for them, and just to be clear, it's not your fault at all.  Thing is, you have the adult responsibility but you don't have the experience to properly manage a child.  I would say you are TA but you shouldn't be in this position to begin with.  NTA.  Protect yourself, mentally.  You deserve to have your own life and  to have a normal sisterly relationship with your younger sister without discipline getting in the way so much.  Best of luck to you.", "It's not your responsibility to parent her. It's no wonder she doesn't give respect you like she should a parent (as it seems you want her to), it's because you're her older sibling.", "Not up to you", "That is not your responsibility.  It is not your job to raise her correctly. If you really want to help her, stop covering for her. Your parents can\u2019t do anything if they don\u2019t know how bad she has gotten. Sit down and have a conversation with them about what you have observed and your concerns.", "I get where you're coming from. I took care of my sister because I didn't want her to go through the same shit I did. Parentification was a thing for me as well. You need a serious talk with your parents. \n\nHere is the thing, do you think she learned something good by calling her a bitch? What did you teach her with it?", "Why? Because the parents don't see a problem with the behavior that she does? Nah, she's clearly the asshole here. She's tormenting her sister.", "And why did you lie to your parents about her pushing you down the stairs? It shows your sister that she can get away with a lot.", "She pushed you down because you were being a little shit. You don't get to tease your sister to the point that she's crying and then act innocent. See point 3 above.\n\nYour parents don't see it as a problem. See point 1 above.", "Yes, and you didn't tell your parents that happened, so they don't know and cannot factor it into their consideration of which kids need their attention.\n\nAlso? While it doesn't excuse her violence, you should not have been teasing her. You both acted badly. She needs actual intervention.\n\nTalk to your parents about how you *need* them to parent all of you, not just the little ones. Talk to other members of the family, if your parents refuse to listen. Kids don't bring themselves up, and shouldn't be expected to.", "Your parents saying if it bothers you so much then you fix it when it comes to any parenting regarding your sister is incredibly inappropriate no matter how much time they do or don\u2019t have.\n\nYou are a child and I don\u2019t mean this in a demeaning way you seem to be thoughtful girl but there shouldn\u2019t even be a dynamic where you are stepping in to parent because they\u2019re \u201cbusy\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure your sister will forgive you siblings fight but I want you to remember you are her sibling and while being older means being able to guide her more you\u2019re ultimately not mom that\u2019s not your job you\u2019re a kid too.", "Having other kids isn't an excuse to neglect her.", "Your parents aren't really nice people if they are refusing to listen to you, and refuse to parent their children as soon as they hit eight or so.\n\nOther parents work, and still parent. Other parents have babies and still parent their older kids. Being a parent means you make that commitment.", "Because then OP would had to admit that she took sisters phone as a joke and refused to return it even after the sister was crying."]}
