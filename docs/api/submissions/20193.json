Every since I was little, my needs for my birthday were always outshines by hers. We always did family events to celebrate our  birthdays since we're the oldest kids in our family, so we kind of just shared a birthday. We had the same cake(My family either never wrote my name on it, or would messily scribble it on at the last minute), party decorations and games catered to her taste, and mostly all gifts would be for her. I just usually ended up getting a $10 gift card for Walmart or something, while she always got dolls, games for her Nintendo DS, and even a puppy one time! I always felt like that I didn't matter for my birthday. Even my quincea\u00f1era fell flat, since my family went all out making my cousin feel like the most special girl in the world. But my cousin was always nice to me, and she would give me some of her gifts just to put a smile on my face.\n\nThis year was my 18th birthday, and all my relatives were gathered in one place to celebrate me and my cousin's birthdays. My mother had promised me my own separate cake, and that it'll be an OREO ice cream cake(My favorite cake). So I was excited. When my abuela gathered the family together to blow out the candles and sing happy birthday, my cousin and I got in our respective spots. They started singing while my mother brought a cake to the table and placed it in front of my cousin. It was a strawberry cheesecake. After we got done singing, my cousin blew out her candles and everybody clapped. My aunt started to cut the cake, and I would audibly ask about my cake. My entire family looks confused, and they all say \"This cake is for the both of you\". My cousin spoke up, saying \"But it only has my name on it\". I looked to my mom, who had a \"What?\" expression on her face. I asked about the cake, and she told me, \"You don't need the extra sugar.\" At that point, I just lost it, screaming at my family members and calling them all AHs. I cried about how this is the fifteenth year in a row that they've left me out and forgot about me, and how they ruined my birthday by always prioritizing my cousin. My cousin and little brother also jumped in and defended me, saying that I'm always never thought of. My abuela had the audacity to deliberately interrupt me, telling me to sit down and stop yelling. Through anger, I yelled that I never wanted to see any of them again and stormed off. My cousin and brother followed me, all comforting me while I cried my eyes out. This happened a few days ago, and I've been receiving angry messages from my family members calling me an ungrateful b****. I'm at my cousin's apartment right now writing this, all while texting my little brother to vent. Reddit, AITA for yelling at my family for not giving me the cake that I've wanted for nearly my entire lifetime?\n\nEdit: After reading the replies, my cousin and I have made the tough decision to block all of the toxic family members and go non-contact.

While I think your reaction could have been addressed with your parents instead of the whole family, it was justified. \n\nMy cousin, sibling, and I have birthdays close together. My sibling and I share a birthday and we would have the same party, but different cakes. My cousin always got the same gifts as my sister and I. We were so annoyed, because it seemed like she was copying us for our entire childhoods. Christmas, birthdays, Easter\u2026 always the same gifts. It wasn\u2019t until years later we realized my mom was always buying extra gifts for my cousin because her mom didn\u2019t have the money to do so.

Even though my situation was much less severe than OPs, I still have some pretty intense frustration surrounding it, and I swear if I get another damn fruit cake next time we celebrate I am honestly going to lose it. My partners family did a better job at getting me my favourite cake than my own.

It's really just a celebration of the cousin's birthday, completely planned by cousin's parents, hence the cake being cousin's fave, and the pile of gifts for cousin only.  OP your parents sound like they have been extremely lazy and uncaring forever. The piggybacking on top of your cousin's birthday celebration probably irritates your cousin's family no end! I have no idea why aunt would be cross with you, unless she feels guilty and feels like in the face of your parents' absolute lack of effort she is being pressured to pick up the slack - eg maybe your mum tells her  that if she thinks you need a separate cake etc she can organise it for you. \n\nAnyway, whatever the complex or simple reasons behind this, you don't need to feel bad at all.

See how stupid that sounds? That's not what's happening; if it's bad during this time of the year, it is without a doubt TERRIBLE the rest of the year.

He's in a bit of an awkward situation where they don't have much of a \"reason\" to dislike him but never had much of one to like him more either. Their biggest complaints about him were the fact that he's fat and that he never studied as a kid. \n\nI'm their favourite because I'm their first grandchild, I'm thin, I studied more as a kid, ended up in a pretty good job and my dad is the only partner any of their kids had that they actually liked. \n\nMost of the reasonings are pretty fucking stupid and I've had fights with my grandparents over it.
