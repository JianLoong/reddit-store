Every since I was little, my needs for my birthday were always outshines by hers. We always did family events to celebrate our  birthdays since we're the oldest kids in our family, so we kind of just shared a birthday. We had the same cake(My family either never wrote my name on it, or would messily scribble it on at the last minute), party decorations and games catered to her taste, and mostly all gifts would be for her. I just usually ended up getting a $10 gift card for Walmart or something, while she always got dolls, games for her Nintendo DS, and even a puppy one time! I always felt like that I didn't matter for my birthday. Even my quincea\u00f1era fell flat, since my family went all out making my cousin feel like the most special girl in the world. But my cousin was always nice to me, and she would give me some of her gifts just to put a smile on my face.\n\nThis year was my 18th birthday, and all my relatives were gathered in one place to celebrate me and my cousin's birthdays. My mother had promised me my own separate cake, and that it'll be an OREO ice cream cake(My favorite cake). So I was excited. When my abuela gathered the family together to blow out the candles and sing happy birthday, my cousin and I got in our respective spots. They started singing while my mother brought a cake to the table and placed it in front of my cousin. It was a strawberry cheesecake. After we got done singing, my cousin blew out her candles and everybody clapped. My aunt started to cut the cake, and I would audibly ask about my cake. My entire family looks confused, and they all say \"This cake is for the both of you\". My cousin spoke up, saying \"But it only has my name on it\". I looked to my mom, who had a \"What?\" expression on her face. I asked about the cake, and she told me, \"You don't need the extra sugar.\" At that point, I just lost it, screaming at my family members and calling them all AHs. I cried about how this is the fifteenth year in a row that they've left me out and forgot about me, and how they ruined my birthday by always prioritizing my cousin. My cousin and little brother also jumped in and defended me, saying that I'm always never thought of. My abuela had the audacity to deliberately interrupt me, telling me to sit down and stop yelling. Through anger, I yelled that I never wanted to see any of them again and stormed off. My cousin and brother followed me, all comforting me while I cried my eyes out. This happened a few days ago, and I've been receiving angry messages from my family members calling me an ungrateful b****. I'm at my cousin's apartment right now writing this, all while texting my little brother to vent.

This family put stress on not only you but also your cousin.\n\nIt's good that you two seem to have a good relationship and can stick by each other. Along with your brother.", "NTA.\n\nApart from your cousin and little brother, your family is horrible. Your mother knew this was an issue for you, made a promise, broke it, and expected you to just shut up and stay quiet about it like you did the previous 14 years.\n\nThis isn't really about the cake, it's about the fact that you're The Lost Child in your family, and no one cares except your cousin and brother.\n\nI mean, if they wanted to plead ignorance, they should be sending messages of concern or confusion, but instead all you're getting are insults for daring to not want to stay in your assigned role of misery. They knew they were ignoring you, they just didn't care and are trying to guilt trip you into staying in their horrible world of dysfunction.\n\nWhen your brother is old enough to be independent, you and him should ditch these people and heal from whatever damage this dysfunction has done to you, your cousin may be forced by them to choose too eventually, but it sounds like she's a good person who will choose you without a second thought because unlike them, she actually likes to see you happy.", "NTA. Your family seems toxic. It's also kind of shocking that your own parents are giving your COUSIN priority over you. I don't know if it's to the point of completely severing them from your life but it sounds like it's close. \n\nIf you still live with them you might want to consider looking for a job so you can move out, or if you're going to college getting some student loans and moving out with that money. \n\nYou've just turned 18 so it might not have sunk in yet, but you can literally do or get yourself whatever you want now. You don't have to put up with them or listen to them. \n\nAlso Have your future bday parties with friends and specifically tell your family they are NOT invited.", "Sounds to me like this was a long time coming. Yes, a cake is a minor thing, but the neglect and always feeling second-best *isn't*. NTA.", "NTA, your mother CLEARLY lied to you", "NTA. Reading this story, this is more than just about some cake. It's about having countless birthday ruined because your special day just didn't feel like your special day. I disagree with the comments telling you to either apologize or get over it. To be honest, the birthday situation just feels like the tip of the iceberg for something worse.", "NTA, it is very clear who this family prioritizes", "NTA. You know them well. In the future if you choose to keep a relationship with them, keep your expectations very low. Because we\u2019re not going to get much.", "Nta, this is just horrible. To promise someone their own cake for their birthday and then not deliver upon said promise. I'm glad your cousin supports you, but this is bigger than the cake. Seek out help from your school counselor, or someone else who can provide family therapy.", "OP, surely it isn't the cake itself that has upset you. The cake they didn't give you is symbolic of their lack of interest in you. They seem to favor your cousin.\n\nAll the grownups in the story are the AHs. I don'\\[t see what you can do about this until you're up and on your own, not dependent on them for bed and board.\n\nThen you can go very LC with them, which they will hate and thoroughly deserve.\n\nN TA.", "NTA your family is awful. Your mother should feel ashamed.", "NTA, this is what happens when you bottle up your feelings. Don't understand why your own parents won't even put your name on the cake. That is just cruel. Go LC with your parents for a bit. If they ask why say I'm just treating you like you always have treated me. If you don't like it take a look in the mirror and  figure out how you can change your attitude towards me. When I see positive change from you then we will start having a better relationship.\n\nAs for your other relatives calling you an ungrateful b*tch. Respond, I would rather be an ungrateful b*tch than a dirty AH but maybe I can work up to it one day by continuing to watch how you do it.", "NTA. How cruel!", "NTA. A joint family party is one thing, but you should get a cake you like. At the very least it should have your name on it too. \n\nDo you at least get a party with your friends that is yours alone?", "You\u2019re NTA. But this is clearly about more than cake. I suggest therapy. I know, you\u2019ll probably say it\u2019s too expensive. Okay. Well, once you can afford it, get it, because it might take years to get to the bottom of your family issues.", "Nah, NTA. This was how I was treated with my older brother, we always had to share a cake with each other and never had my name on any of them, it's frustrating I know. I don't blame my parents for this because we were pretty poor then and they put as much as they could into those cakes. Where they became the ahole was promising you your own separate cake, then proceeding to not only not get you that cake but not even put your name on that cake. I am truly sorry that your family treated you that way. That was very wrong for them to do. Also, them calling you names like that is pretty toxic and I'd not lose sleep over blocking their numbers, no family should be treating you like that. It's pretty sad when the kids if the family \"you, your cousin, and little brother\" are the only ones being the adults in this situation.", "NTA. As soon as you can leave go NC with this family. They don\u2019t care about you.", "Fifteenth cake was the last straw. NTA. Sounds extremely thoughtless.", "Nta. Don\u2019t see them again, why would you. You said you weren\u2019t so make it true.

You stood up for yourself now stand by it.", "As someone who\u2019s entire childhood birthday was shared with my grandfather, aunt and a National holiday\u2026I feel your pain.  I never got to choose even my own meal.  We always had the same thing.  What my family wanted.  But I did get actual gifts.  And sadly, my grandfather and aunt passed away while I was a teen.  I still had no say in my birthday, again, it\u2019s on a national holiday with a sorta classic menu.  There\u2019s no eating out.  And if we did, again, sorta a set menu.  As an adult? With no parents and no siblings anymore?  I spend day doing what I want and make myself whatever I want.  No need to keep up a tradition I hated\u2026.so it won\u2019t get better.  Sorry.  It just won\u2019t.  Unless you and your cousin are firm about NOT celebrating together or without your family.  Your family isn\u2019t going to change.  They\u2019re just not.

Be thankful your cousin and brother have stuck by you. \n\nShould you apologize? I would say it might be the right thing to do, but if I were in your situation I honestly wouldn\u2019t. But I also think if I was in that situation I would just stop attending the parties and go hangout with friends and such if I was treated that poorly.\n\nI wish you the best and hope you can make some amends, and I sympathize with you that you were treated that way. Cheers, friend.", "Considering you were promised a cake that built your expectation I think you're NTA.  But you've had your meltdown and the family well and truly knows now how it made you feel,  so now imo you should let it go.
