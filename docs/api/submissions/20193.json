Every since I was little, my needs for my birthday were always outshines by hers. We always did family events to celebrate our  birthdays since we're the oldest kids in our family, so we kind of just shared a birthday. We had the same cake(My family either never wrote my name on it, or would messily scribble it on at the last minute), party decorations and games catered to her taste, and mostly all gifts would be for her. I just usually ended up getting a $10 gift card for Walmart or something, while she always got dolls, games for her Nintendo DS, and even a puppy one time! I always felt like that I didn't matter for my birthday. Even my quincea\u00f1era fell flat, since my family went all out making my cousin feel like the most special girl in the world. But my cousin was always nice to me, and she would give me some of her gifts just to put a smile on my face.\n\nThis year was my 18th birthday, and all my relatives were gathered in one place to celebrate me and my cousin's birthdays. My mother had promised me my own separate cake, and that it'll be an OREO ice cream cake(My favorite cake). So I was excited. When my abuela gathered the family together to blow out the candles and sing happy birthday, my cousin and I got in our respective spots. They started singing while my mother brought a cake to the table and placed it in front of my cousin. It was a strawberry cheesecake. After we got done singing, my cousin blew out her candles and everybody clapped. My aunt started to cut the cake, and I would audibly ask about my cake. My entire family looks confused, and they all say \"This cake is for the both of you\". My cousin spoke up, saying \"But it only has my name on it\". I looked to my mom, who had a \"What?\" expression on her face. I asked about the cake, and she told me, \"You don't need the extra sugar.\" At that point, I just lost it, screaming at my family members and calling them all AHs. I cried about how this is the fifteenth year in a row that they've left me out and forgot about me, and how they ruined my birthday by always prioritizing my cousin. My cousin and little brother also jumped in and defended me, saying that I'm always never thought of. My abuela had the audacity to deliberately interrupt me, telling me to sit down and stop yelling. Through anger, I yelled that I never wanted to see any of them again and stormed off. My cousin and brother followed me, all comforting me while I cried my eyes out. This happened a few days ago, and I've been receiving angry messages from my family members calling me an ungrateful b****. I'm at my cousin's apartment right now writing this, all while texting my little brother to vent.

Your parents and family decided to do that every single year. I don\u2019t blame you.", "NTA - it sounds like everyone other than your brother and awesome cousin are horrible people. Go give your amazing cousin a hug and tell her how great she is.\n\n\nTell everyone else clearly and concisely that they are assholes, especially grandma.\n\n\nIt's not just the cake - they never got you presents or even really acknowledged it was your birthday. They catered everything to your cousin, who's only two years older than you - so it isn't like she was set on a theme for her birthday at 2.", "NTA your family besides your brother and cousin suck. Your mom especially, you are her child and she lets you down again and again, even promising you something then not delivering. I\u2019m sorry OP, you should have been made to feel important", "NTA\n\n> ungrateful\n\n#FOR WHAT?!?", "NTA\n\nAnd I know it doesn't mean much coming from an internet stranger but HAPPY BIRTHDAY!\n\nI hope you can at least see the one good thing that came out of this is your cousin and your brother have your back.  \n\nThe \"adults\" in your life are probably embarrassed that you threw the truth in their faces.  Your mom especially given she couldn't at least get your name on the cake.", "NTA. Good for you for standing up to them. I\u2019m sorry they kept doing this to you. It is NOT ok what they did, they have no RIGHT to be mad, but YOU absolutely do have the right to be mad. \n\nI\u2019m glad your cousin and brother defended you. You deserve a great birthday too.", "NTA. While I think your reaction could have been addressed with your parents instead of the whole family, it was justified. \n\nMy cousin, sibling, and I have birthdays close together. My sibling and I share a birthday and we would have the same party, but different cakes. My cousin always got the same gifts as my sister and I. We were so annoyed, because it seemed like she was copying us for our entire childhoods. Christmas, birthdays, Easter\u2026 always the same gifts. It wasn\u2019t until years later we realized my mom was always buying extra gifts for my cousin because her mom didn\u2019t have the money to do so. Do your parents have the money for separate cake and decorations, or is it your aunt/uncle who is funding the party? Maybe if you can understand who is buying the decor and cake, you can determine why things have occurred.", "I absolutely understand what OP is feeling. My brother and I would often have shared birthday parties when we visited our dad in the summer, and EVERY YEAR my brother would get a chocolate or Oreo ice cream cake (my favourite) and EVERY YEAR I\u2019d get a lemon custard fruit cake, which I never ate because it legitimately makes me gag. Even though my situation was much less severe than OPs, I still have some pretty intense frustration surrounding it, and I swear if I get another damn fruit cake next time we celebrate I am honestly going to lose it. My partners family did a better job at getting me my favourite cake than my own. It seems small but it means a lot to be shown that you\u2019re appreciated on your birthday.", "Every birthday, holiday gift to your family should be a pack of oreos or just a single oreo. I would just go and stay NC with the lot of them.\n\nNTA", "Probably doesn't though.", "Exactly what I was thinking.  It's really just a celebration of the cousin's birthday, completely planned by cousin's parents, hence the cake being cousin's fave, and the pile of gifts for cousin only.  OP your parents sound like they have been extremely lazy and uncaring forever. The piggybacking on top of your cousin's birthday celebration probably irritates your cousin's family no end! I have no idea why aunt would be cross with you, unless she feels guilty and feels like in the face of your parents' absolute lack of effort she is being pressured to pick up the slack - eg maybe your mum tells her  that if she thinks you need a separate cake etc she can organise it for you. \n\nAnyway, whatever the complex or simple reasons behind this, you don't need to feel bad at all.  Make plans for a better life without your family - just keep the people who are good to you!", "My oldest and youngest missed sharing a birthday by 36 hours. Family parties were shared events and when they were older they had separate friend parties. My poor middle childs birthday was near a holiday and it was usually the first day back at school. So we'd do her friend parties 6 months later in the summer.", "Glad you asked this, since I answered in another comment. My mom is simply just penny-pinching. We have a big house, two expensive cars in our driveway, and my brother\u2019s soon headed into a private school.", "It's not exactly a dumb thing they \"sometimes\" do, if they do it every single year. It's not a mistake, they re doing it on purpose.", "\n\n>family well and truly knows now how it made you feel\n\nyeah, they seem real sorry for how they've treated her \ud83d\ude44", "Chosen family can be 1000x more profound and fulfilling than blood family. That\u2019s absolutely not the only family she has, and no one needs to put up with being an afterthought", "Growing up, my parents always compared me to my cousin. \u201cEmily has better grades, her pictures look prettier, her blonde locks are gorgeous(I have African-American roots, so I have curly, frizzy hair), You\u2019re going into art? Well, she\u2019s going into medical school!\u201d. I\u2019ve never resented my cousin for being better, but I hated my parents constantly shoving it in my face.", "My MIL of over 25 years still gets me peanut brittle nearly every Christmas. I've always hated nuts. But at least that's an expected thing for your inlaws to treat you as 2nd best - I'm  not their actual kid. I really feel for you.", "Evil me says to just throw the cake at the wall next time.", "NTA. Reading this story, this is more than just about some cake. It's about having countless birthday ruined because your special day just didn't feel like your special day.", "I think they\u2019re just mean.", "OP says they have money and everyone pays equally, so I'm not sure how true this could be.\n\nThe unrealistically dramatic part of me thinks maybe the cousin is actually OP's older sibling, and aunt and uncle took her in. That would explain why everyone, even OP's own parents, favor her. However, I know that's just all the tv dramas I've been watching.", "That\u2019s really sweet and I\u2019m glad you got your cake after all.", "NTA I'm sorry they're so mean to you", "You should be angry at your mom and not your relatives.  But you should also play the long game and be the nice daughter or else you won\u2019t get anything in the will lol.", "you're possibly right, people are weird and surprisingly clueless about how their actions are affecting someone.  I wouldn't be that surprised if they had thought everything was mostly fine.\n\nAs for sometimes, we have no idea if the family is nice most of the time or not, or if OP has some Jealousy issues with her cousin and can only see the negatives, so there is a whole lot of unknowns.. is it worth ditching family over?  I'll stick with NTA because they told her they were making a cake and didn't, OP said her piece and kudos to her for calling it out this time.", "That doesn't knockout the option that the parents might be lazy. Let cousins parents plan the whole party with all her wants and likes and then just stick OP in. \n\nThough in that situation, the aunt and uncle should've started putting in the effort for OP years ago when they realized her parents weren't going to do the work. Poor OP.", "I was actually ready to see another story of the mean golden child, but I was actually shocked to find out that the cousin's not that. It's amazing how despite her surroundings, she didn't become some entitled brat.", "Her and her cousin should've tossed the cake at the adult relatives.", "Are you one of those people who believe that raising your voice is never okay?\n\nAnd you think it \u201cmight\u201d be the right thing to apologize to people who called her an \u201cungrateful bitch\u201d?", "OP freaking out over a cake doesn't seem like your classic jealous teenage girl or a nice family slipping up on something. What we got away from the relatives' reactions to OP sticking her ground speaks volumes; they are simple just not nice. This reaction isn't just from a birthday party, or 15 to be exact; it's consistent abuse and neglect from her family. She's NTA for breaking this cycle and if I hope she makes an update explaining her family even more.", "More likely they are a doormat or an enabler so of course OP as the victim has to be wrong in their eyes. How dare she not put up with her family's shenanigans on yet another major milestone birthday. /s", "You're adding a whole bunch of speculation, it's even possible you're right.  But there are many scenario's where you could also be wrong.", "Come on, man, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that her family's neglectful and toxic. OP's replies to some of the comments and the clear reaction of her family members are supporting the argument. And your argument of \"imperfect families = neglectful families\" is blasphemous.", "OP would have to say if her family is neglectful and toxic or if it's just been problematic around the combined birthdays.\n\nI'm not totally disagreeing with you, but it's not a done deal the family is completely toxic.... who knows it could be a birthday mad Aunt who has an over spoilt child (the cousin) dominating it for all we know.", "Do you\u2014 do you really think that the family is just nice all year long but the moment it pops around OP's birthday, they just decide to get all neglectful, abusive, and toxic? See how stupid that sounds? That's not what's happening; if it's bad during this time of the year, it is without a doubt TERRIBLE the rest of the year. Abuse victims aren't always aware that they're being abused, or sometimes are afraid to speak up about it. Abuse is a terrible thing, and a taboo topic to bring up.", "It is actually the toxic family considering the cousin and the little brother also protested against this ongoing mistreatment. It's especially bad when the favored child can safely point out the favoritism and ask on behalf of their neglected family member \"Why did you do this and ignore OP yet again?\"", "right...... so if something has a flaw in one area then all areas must be flawed.  I get it. \n\nIt's a very simple view you've taken.. but there are actually millions of other possibilities", "Well they are obviously toxic around the birthday, and yeah maybe it's much bigger than birthdays, I'm not defending the family.. I just don't know them, do you know?"]}
