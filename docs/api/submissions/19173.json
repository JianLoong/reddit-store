Some will, but most won\u2019t; it is neither an admission nor a graduation requirement.", "I\u2019m in Australia. Dropped my curriculum maths subject in year 10 and took Trade and Business mathematics instead (usually reserved for the kids doing TAFE/trade prep); by not consistently failing something that wasn\u2019t my thing I still managed to get into a Bachelor of Linguistics and Languages.", "You think content a 15 year old high school kid is expected to learn will somehow be too difficult for someone with a bachelor's degree? Does that not sounds stupid to you?", "Do you have a graduate degree in mathematics?  Why are you more qualified than she is?  YTA because grades are up and yet you\u2019re here.", "This! Education systems are vastly different around the world and people in this sub seem to be quite international.", "English degree for me, and \u201ccollege math for liberal arts majors\u201d saved me!", "I majored in biology and I had to take various college level maths and even a statistics class. Not to mention I had to take a literature and speech classes so I'd know how to write essays and to an audience. Colleges and universities do this so students are balanced and know things that could help aside from just their object of study. It is completely reasonable that MIL took higher level maths when she was getting her degree and can easily understand highschool level maths and tutor her grandson.", "I assume you at least took high school math. Also, parents help their children with homework all the time. They\u2019re not required to have advanced levels in any of the topics.", "Nope.  You can actually skip math completely at some U.C.s (Univ. of Cal.) if you take the right courses for your breadth requirements.  But I have degrees from 2 U.C.s in literature and I've worked as a bookkeeper, so OP is making some silly assumptions about his MIL's skills.  Many of us never took Calculus and could easily tutor high school algebra and geometry.  I've done it.", "And indeed, the reverse: someone with an Stoxbridge maths degree is highly unlikely to have studied a humanity since 16: I suspect the most common A level combination is maths, further maths and physics (I might be wrong, but it'll be something like that).", "Yeah in the U.K. even in degrees that involves modules in different subjects it\u2019s humanities or STEM. \n\nI don\u2019t hate the idea of people taking classes in the other side, but I\u2019d have hated maths lessons and work to have had a baring on my degree classification.", "I'm not in the US and my university, while having some general education requirements, did not make you take maths as part of this. You could literally take some of the easiest arts papers where as long as you showed up and turned in something you would get a pass.", "18 in my country, but the sentiment is the same. It\u2019s either all the math and no languages or all the languages and no math. That there is more to humanities than just languages is conveniently ignored"]}
