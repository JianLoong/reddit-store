Experts can be trash teachers because often they don't consciously recognize all the things they've absorbed so they don't realize which steps they're skipping and that they need to teach those and they tend to get impatient (which yes I'm curious if that's what went down w/ her son b/f MiL stepped in)", "Results would indicate she's competent and you already asked her if she's confident. Super weird that you don't trust your own family", "It\u2019s high school math. Apparently, she is doing fine, because he performed well on his recent test.

You are wacky...", "People can be good at things that aren't their field of expertise. I was always really good at math, but I never got a degree in it. Does that suddenly make me not good at math anymore?", "Do you have a degree in maths or teaching?", "Is it your or your husbands field of expertise? \n\nIt\u2019s high school math not rocket science. If she comes across something she doesn\u2019t know maybe that will show your son that adults don\u2019t know everything and struggle sometimes too and they could I don\u2019t know learn it together. Which could be more impactful. \n\nThey both enjoy the tutoring. Your sons grades are improving.

Or are you just jealous that they enjoy spending the time together.", "I majored in Poly Sci in college, but I still had math in HS. I just had to read the chapter to remember how it was done to be able to tutor my niece through her senior year of HS math. Just because she majored in history doesn't mean she wasn't good at math.\n\nCollege SHOULD have taught you how to read and digest information and communicate that info to others.

The most advanced math your kid could be taking is precalculus or trigonometry at 15, but most likely, it's algebra 1 or 2.  She got into college, so very likely she passed all her required high school math courses.", "So, what's your degree in?", "Are you a fucking mathematician? If not, then by your own logic you shouldn\u2019t be helping your son with his math homework either. And the way you said she \u201conly\u201d has a bachelors degree is so condescending.

I have a sociology degree and a JD, but I\u2019m pretty damn certain I could handle freshman math. \u201cExpertise\u201d is something you use when talking about someone\u2019s career, not freshman math.

She\u2019s a better parent and tutor than you. What a shame.", "Yet he was struggling despite his hard work. MIL starts tutoring and BAM\u2026 good grades\u2026 why are you so intent on ignoring the correlation? Clearly whatever she is doing with him is helping him.. not just on subject matter necessarily either. Perhaps she is instilling more confidence in him and her method of teaching may be what he needed to understand.\nWhatever the case, you can\u2019t say \u201che\u2019s a hard worker so I should attribute his grades to that\u201d and completely ignore that his hard work wasn\u2019t enough on its own if his grades were suffering\u2026 then bring MIL into the mix, see an improvement and discredit any help she has given him. Everyone learns differently. The material may not have clicked with his teachers methods but did with MIL.

I know one of them was an Arts Administration major, and one was at a school where they defined their own majors.
