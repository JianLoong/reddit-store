Is the illness you're suffering from mental?", "It's early high school math, she doesn't have to be an expert. They're not doing calculus", "Do you have a degree in math?", "It\u2019s school maths", "My field of expertise isn\u2019t math or history, but I\u2019ve tutored people in both areas. Are you secretly Ada Lovelace? Get over yourself.", "Bruh, it\u2019s school, it\u2019s not up in the expertise yet", "Stop being such a condescending degree snob! High school material doesn\u2019t require a PhD.\n\nPhD material does.\n\nJ.K. Rowling *only* has a three years Bachelors of Arts in French.\n\nIf your son\u2019s grades improve, it\u2019s all that matters.", "YTA\n \nShe probably did alright and remembers the concepts.  It is possible that her presence relaxes him enabling him to improve. Don\u2019t worry unless his grades dip", "Are you a math teacher?", "Then why let her tutor at all? You are being unfair to your kid by getting him incompetent help. YTA either way.", "My dad is an accountant. Would you think math is his area of expertise and trust him to teach your son? You\u2019d be a fool if you did, because he\u2019s awful at it. But if you need someone to teach you about the Civil War, he\u2019s your man!\n\nMy mom is a history teacher. You probably wouldn\u2019t trust her math abilities, but you\u2019d be wrong again. She\u2019s great at it.\n\nYou would be amazed at what people know outside their professional field of expertise. My grandfather, for example, is an organic chemist, a Rabbi\u2026 and an artist. My MIL is telecommunications engineer, but has a computer science degree due to women not being eligible for the telecommunications degree when she went to college (yes, that was a thing). She\u2019s also an incredible seamstress and knitter. \n\nAnd I know many other people who\u2019s skills extend far beyond the thing they decided to get their degree in - something that, for many, came down to \u2018it made the most financial sense\u2019.", "Newsflash people learn things out of university", "iTs NoT hEr FiElD oF ExPeRtiSe \n\nseems like if that was your concern you should have hired him an actual math tutor in the first place. you waiting until after his math test, and him doing WELL ON IT, and THEN YOU COMPLAINING just sounds like you\u2019re jealous.", "Y'know, YTA.  My degree - that I finally got around to finishing when I was 50 - is in IT Management (originally it was History); minimal math required.  However, I am responsible for all the higher math calculations in our office (go research measurement uncertainty).  I'm good at math, but damn well didn't want to study it.  Did you ever think your MIL may be the same?\n\nOne doesn't need a BS in math to understand it.", "Why does her bachelors degree topic matter? How is that relevant? She is teaching your son high school math, which she took, not college level math??", "If hard work was all that was required, why was he struggling in the first place? Why did she start tutoring him if he can do it himself? If his hard work is enough to improve despite what you are assuming is poor tutoring, then what\u2019s the problem?", "YTA. Your MIL is willing to help you take care of your sons education, and you\u2019re persistently trying to find ways in which she isn\u2019t qualified. It\u2019s incredibly rude and ungrateful of you. Keep in mind that your MIL is under NO obligation to help you take care of your son, nor is she responsible for his education. But she\u2019s willing to help out, and seems to enjoy it too, and in return, you\u2019re saying she\u2019s unqualified.\n\nAlso, asking your husband to \u201cmonitor\u201d your MIL? Really? \n\nI don\u2019t see what the problem is if your son is getting acceptable grades. If it\u2019s because of his hard work as you claim, again, I don\u2019t see the problem. He\u2019s getting his marks and that\u2019s what matters.\n\nThis seems to be a classic case of humanities degrees being looked down upon. Just because MIL has a degree in Ancient History does not make her incompetent in math. Your husband is right, you\u2019re being disrespectful. Show her some appreciation rather than doubting her.", "let\u2019s say we concede and your mil doesn\u2019t know maths that well\u2026 what if even if just sitting down with an adult to review the material is helping why are you being so difficult for something that is clearly helpful?", "That's interesting to me because I'm a fine arts major and having to take math. Everyone at my college has to take some form of math and it's the same for my degree when I transfer to Arizona state.", "Really? I earned my bachelor\u2019s in arts and had to take basic math as a requirement. There were opportunities to place out of requirements, but you had to prove you were already competent in the subject. I know of very few universities in the US that don\u2019t require any prerequisites to earn a major.", "Same. I took it anyway, but I didn\u2019t have to. The only required course everyone across the board had to take where I went was Expository Writing 101.", "Then you probably tested out of it by taking an advanced math in high school\n\nIt\u2019s really not uncommon. Just like how many lib arts majors test out of language or basic arriving for the same reason.", "Doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s incapable of it. Also doesn\u2019t mean the son was taking a particularly difficult math.", "i feel like OP doesnt like that the son is doing well with the mil tutoring him and its hurting her ego", "Gulp thank god thats not the case here, I was able to get through post grad education having only year 10 maths levels", "Okay, but basic college algebra is a joke to someone in the STEM fields.  Still it seems that MIL is doing fine and son/grandson is enjoying the experience and excelling.  This reeks of jealousy.  Op YTA.", "Must be a US thing? At our Universities you only would do maths if it's relevant for your degree. I was able to get through a Bachelor's and post-grad without doing any maths thank goodness, I'd have been screwed  if they required maths classes!", "I had to take other prereq classes, but not math. My major had fewer gen ed requirements, but more actual major requirements, if that makes sense.", "No I did not! I took Pre-Calculus, which was expected for 12th graders at the time. I sucked at math, and specifically chose a major for which I wouldn't need it. I tested out of 3 other gen ed subjects, but math was not one of them.", "You sound very jealous about your MIL being smarter than you \ud83e\udd23", "Too*", "He\u2019s fucking 15 and still in HS, JFC\u2026.", "So hire a math tutor and let your MIL get back to her life.", "I mean that depends on where you get your degree, I didn't have one math class in my humanities undergrad. \nIf OP is in the US then you're most likely right but not every country has the same degree structure. \n\nThat being said, still agree with the YTA decision, unless OP has a clear sign that MIL's tutoring is making his math grades worse.", "I think it must be an American thing. At both universities I went to in Canada I did not have to do a math course in order to get my humanities or education degrees.", "Well, that's not fair, OP has already made it known that common sense is not her area of expertise.", "I took calculus, trig, and advanced algebra in high school for college credit and tested out of math classes in college. High school classes can be substitute for college general math classes.", "LOL. Good answer, Horshack."]}
