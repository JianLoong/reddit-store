The absolute quickest way is to point out some really neat animal/plant/fungus just outside the lecture theatre, and say \u201cwow, if only David Attenborough were here.\u201d)\n\n(after that: fire, then math.)\n\nBeing forced to do that pesky first year stats requirement stirred a deep resentment within me, but \u2014 though it has been well over two decades \u2014 I\u2019m still fairly confident I could knock out the 15 year old math equivalents pretty well.\n\nMajoring in a humanities field does not just *wipe all the numbers out of your brain.*", "I only have a bachelor degree not related to math. This is by choice since I like my profession. I happended to be top of my class in math (not American so not high school but equvalent to college level). Her son is improving his skills and she's not confident in MILs knowledge? Even if MIL is no good at math, she is clearly good at teaching OP's son how to learn math. OP sounds petty and kind of jealous. Yta", "Me too. My hackles rose at that.", "So you're going to take away a once in a lifetime opportunity for your son to get compassionate one-on-one learning time with his nan for...a 'what if'? I have two advanced degrees in education, and very often the material I'm teaching is not something innately familiar to me. So I learn it. I study it, I practice it, I discuss it with my colleagues, and then I teach it. I let my students know whilst I'm teaching that even though I've studied this topic, mistakes are possible, and then we discuss how we all handle those mistakes.\n\nMaybe...***maybe*** your MIL is modelling for your son what a lifelong learner looks like. Maybe she's showing him what it looks like to work through a problem even if it's not simple at the start. Maybe she's showing him that people are capable of infinite things when they aren't stunted by other people's judgment and preconceived notions of what they can and cannot do (looking at you OP).\n\nYTA, obviously. Not just for judging you MIL needlessly, but for considering taking this time from them for no good reason.", "OP-what\u2019s your advanced degree in, if I may ask? I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s mathematics, since you\u2019ve let your MIL know you\u2019re available to answer any questions.", "So MIL had nothing to do with grades improving, but if they drop its because she's unqualified?", "I think the Snark credits transfer, so you should be good. \n\nSigned, someone with a Masters in Snark and a PhD in Sarcasm. In case you couldn\u2019t tell.", "MIL helps OPs son\n\nOPs son\u2019s grades improve\n\nOP \u201cI think it was mostly his effort alone and there is no way MIL is smart enough to understand hs math\u201d\n\nOP, if you\u2019re so willing to tell your MIL to come to you if she doesn\u2019t understand something, why didn\u2019t **you** tutor your own child before his grades became an issue? \n\nYou\u2019re an AH", "Exactly, also most social science degrees makes you more qualified to do a lot of things because the skills you learn in social sciences are primarily for reliable research", "Chances are the child just needs someone to sit with him and give him positive reinforcement, and suddenly he spends an hour a day on math, not the usual 15 min.", "If it were entirely to his merit then why did he need grandma to tutor him in the first place?", "Your son ain\u2019t special and your MIL is better at math and parenting than you", "What\u2019s the damn problem? He\u2019s doing well and she\u2019s helping him with tutoring. You seem to have an ulterior motive.", "And you had nothing to do with his success that just kills you doesn\u2019t it", "It\u2019s jr high/high school math, presumably she would\u2019ve learned it once already. \n\nMath at that level isn\u2019t very hard, you can honestly get by if you just read the notes and look at the practice questions/answers to test if you\u2019re correct and then teach how you got the answer to your child\u2026\u2026\n\nI think you\u2019re making math harder than it is", "To be honest based on your responses I am over here questioning your intelligence!", "Exactly. So much US-centrism happening here! I don't know anyone who did an arts or humanities degree that studied maths beyond GCSE (16). Same the other way - of my friends who did maths and science degrees very few studied languages or humanities or arts beyond GCSE. Even those who went to Oxford and Cambridge.", "Even if OP were somehow right, that MIL with a full high school and university education, did not know enough maths to teach a 15yo. Still, teaching someone else is actually the best way to learn something, so the kid could be learning just by explaining stuff to his grandmother.", "I wonder what OPs education level is", "I have two history degrees, I also have an A* in GCSE Maths, a Distinction in Further Maths, and an A* in A level Maths at which point I did in fact score higher than my sister the now medical Dr where maths was a requirement for her degree. Can people please stop assuming that us with humanities degrees can't do maths?\n\nIdk if it's just me but I genuinely think it's people assuming that the Humanities can't do maths because surely they'd have done a STEM degree for the money and the only reason we do humanities is because we cant do it \ud83d\ude44 certainly I had my maths and physics teachers trying to make me give up my plans to study history at uni because \"you can do history as a hobby but STEM pays more\" and it was so frustrating because they didn't understand that I wanted to do it because it was a) more interesting to me b) is hugely important as a field in its own right (like seriously we need more awareness of the past and biases right now) c) it gives me a ton of transferable skills (hello library work).\n\nSorry for the rant, this is such a sore spot for me.", "It\u2019s \u201conly\u201d a bachelors in ancient history. \ud83d\ude44 dear lord this OP\u2026", "Gotta love internalized misogyny!", "My Masters is in history and I *can't* really do maths, but that certainly doesn't mean other history people can't.", "I have no idea about ancient history, but I know a little bit of mathematics, and well... The ancient Greeks they sort of invented a lot of it, well they refined that which they learned from the Sumerians.\n\nMIL will soon be exposed when Son gets onto a lot of the statistical methods as that's 17th century on so very much out of her wheelhouse.", "This is what I was wondering. Is she a mathematician", "My university had a couple of math general ed requirements - but if you asked around, you could find the ones that didn't require much actual math. I took a basic astronomy course where the professor said, \"Look, I know you're all humanities majors, so I'm going to keep the math to a minimum so you can enjoy learning about astronomy\" and a biology course on the evolution of social systems where the math component was mostly multiplying fractions.\n\nI was actually pretty decent at high school math, but I wasn't about to complain about not using it in college.", "This is what I was hoping to see. If the kid is 15, he's almost certainly in his freshman year of high school, so unless he's a math wiz, and it doesn't sound like he is, he's likely doing introductory algebra or pre-algebra. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to help a kid sort out x^2+11=19 with a textbook and other materials in front of them.", "This. \n\nSome people are really good teachers, regardless of the subject matter, because they can help you figure out the best way for you to learn. \n\nMaths is pure logic - if you can understand patterns and are able to reduce the abstract and variable into a theory that is communicable, you\u2019re a good maths teacher. \n\nI\u2019m not surprised that someone with a BA in ancient history is able to communicate patterns and seemingly intangible concepts to a child. I essentially taught myself high school maths to land an A and then helped my engineer ex with his applied mathematics work because logic and comms. \n\nOP should seriously consider educating herself.", "This is how I \"helped\" my kids with their math homework.  I would sit down and have them explain the process to me.  Half the time I remembered what I had learned and the other half was, this new fangled math everyone is talking about.", "I'm confused how OP was able to string this post together since it doesn't seem that she has a PhD in writing.", "Right? Talk about flawed logic. Maybe OP should cast a critical eye over their own education...", "Jeez...I have a Bachelor's degree in *theater* and somehow, I'm also really good at math...how could that be?  OP is being ridiculous. YTA, OP.", "I mean...I have a master's degree and I'm absolutely horrible at math. I can't do basic algebra. It's embarrassing. But that doesn't mean everyone is the same.", "I\u2019m love your methods for emptying a room of biology students by the way.", "It works both ways.  I have an engineering degree, so it is naturally assumed that I can do math (I can).  However, I am also an excellent communicator, can write clearly and concisely, can spell, can use proper grammar, and I have a long-standing interest in history, which I pursue when I have any free time.  The kid's grades are improving and OP should zip it.", "Hahahaha I understand that you might be projecting but for a lot of people, even people that studied History or Art, high school math is actually not that difficult.\nIt's not your MIL faults that you are uneducated and apparently your lack of culture doesn't permit you from knowing basic stuff.", "Your MIL is a better parent than you", "Plus there are plenty of online resources that can help MIL learn and teach.", "The OP needs an education in being grateful her MIL is helping while she is ill.  It seems she needs a class in gratitude.", "I think BECAUSE OP lacks a post-secondary education, we were clued in early on that they are, in fact, TA.", "That's okay but to assume someone study history some this person must be bad in math - that is kinda asshole move.\n\nHer son does fine but still MIL must be a bad tutor because....", "Did you get into college without taking high school maths?", "Yes I agree OP is TA in this situation", "I sure did. Wasn't a necessity after year 11 so I didn't take it. Went to university straight after high school. It's not a requirement everywhere.", "I'm in the US, and what people are saying about general education requirements is true. I'm currently a science major, but I have to take fine arts and communications. This has been pretty standard since I graduated high school 20 years ago.", "Most of the European universities don't have a general education requirements. My mother is linguistics major and she never had any math in Uni. Same goes for the majority of people that studied any of the humanities. This of course doesn't mean that you are bad at math. Maybe OP's MIL learnt a lot in high school or she simply liked math. YTA, for picking unnecessary fights.", "I like the theory of how US universities make you take unrelated classes so you can get a broader education and dip your toe in areas you're interested in... the theory being that sure, you're a mathematician, but all Good Elite Humans (as uni grads were) need to know a bit about literature/history/etc.\n\nBut often people say \"if only UK-Politician-X had studied Maths too, not just Politics\" or \"if only MadScientist-Z had studied History!\" but I mean, look at america, the problem still exists!", "Ahh so you\u2019re the British school system like me, did Maths at GCSE, then chose specific A-levels. They don\u2019t do that in America, it\u2019s regular school until 18 then Uni, so they would have been doing maths. \n\nI am presuming OP is American because \u201cmath\u201d", "Yeah, I generally assume most OPs are American unless otherwise stated tbh. I'm in NZ, so I think our schooling is based more on the UK system. I did NCEA Level 1 and got my maths credits, then dropped it and did stuff I actually enjoy for L2 and L3, and got University Entrance. Done. Certainly none of this maths for your BA either."]}
