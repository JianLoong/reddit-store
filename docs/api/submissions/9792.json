Assuming you would just pay with no conditions is ridiculous.\n\nI could not be with someone who wouldn't discuss this with me first.", "NTA what you\u2019re asking for is COMPLETELY REASONABLE.

I will never understand people who make financial decisions with someone else\u2019s money. It\u2019s not your fault that her sister and her man are in a bind.

If you are planning to help, help them.\n\nForcing her to apologize to them for something that should be between you and her is just going to sour the relationship. It\u2019s little cracks like these that don\u2019t go away.

NTA to think she should have talked to you before promising (especially if she couldn't pay on her own if you said no), but the issue is between you and her, not her and her sister.  It comes off like you are trying to punish or embarrass her.  Drop that - it's pointless and kind of gross.  You might want to talk to the sister when you give $ and let her know yourself what you can and cannot help with, limits/terms etc.  You could also make sure your GF is on the same page with not making these promises - it costs her nothing to tell the sister she'd talk about it or look into finances or think about it and get back to her.  Setting future expectations is totally sensible.  The weird apology requirement is not.  It is not her sister's business whether your GF caused a problem with you with the promise or not, and there's no reason to publicize a disagreement or pull family into it, unless you're trying to find a worse fight.", "INFO: How serious is this relationship? Even if you aren\u2019t married, are your finances combined? Do you have a close relationship with her sister? \n\nI\u2019m leaning toward YTA, because it just seems you guys have different ideas about how your finances are combined but having your gf to tell her sister \u201cit was wrong to promise her my money\u201d, is an asshole move. What do you gain from that? She\u2019s an adult not a child you have to enforce a punishment on. \n\nIt seems your gf thinks ur serious enough to consider y\u2019all\u2019s finances as combined and you disagree. Have a discussion about that.", "NTA I actually had a very similar thing happen to me.\n\nMy GF's dog needed surgery and it was just under $10K. My GF told the vet to move forward, even though I'm the one who makes most of the money so I would be the one paying for it. \n\nI love my GF and obviously want her to be happy, and her dog dying would cause her a lot of distress, so I was fine paying for it, but I'm also a big baby with ego issues so I told her that I would only pay for it if she told the vet that I'm the boss in our relationship and she had the dog ask me for the money himself. \n\nAnyway, the dog couldn't learn to speak English in time and didn't really understand the concept of money anyway, so it ended up dying, but the point is, I'm not an asshole and neither are you. \n\nEgo soothing power trips are important because when you do something nice for someone, you want to make sure to do it in such a way that instead of being remembered as \"that really nice, generous, loving guy who helped when needed\" people remember you as \"that weird, petty asshole.\"", "ESH. \n\nI'm assuming you don't have a joint financial situation so yes it's your money and she doesn't have the right to just give it out. Even if it was a joint situation this is a big monetary commitment that she should have discussed with you before hand. \n\nThat being said I think it's a weird power trip to have her apologize to her family for wronging you. It wasn't right of her to do it, and if you for whatever reason you were unwilling to pay/unable to pay she would have to tell them obviously. But you are paying the rent, so literally all you get out of this is humiliating your gf. \n\nEither you two work it out together, or you split. You don't need to make your relationship problems public.\n\nEdit: ok looking at some of these comments kinda just makes me further agree with my judgement. Some of the comments and a response from OP make it sound like this is all to teach the GF a lesson or put her in her place. Look even if she did something wrong she is a person, and OPs equal. If you are in a relationship and you have a conflict the healthy goal is to resolve that conflict, not punish the other party. If you feel the need to put your significant other in their place (in this case kinda publicly) that's not how you should treat an adult person. That's how you treat a dog or sometimes a child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
