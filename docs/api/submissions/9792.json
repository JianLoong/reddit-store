You might want to talk to the sister when you give $ and let her know yourself what you can and cannot help with, limits/terms etc.  You could also make sure your GF is on the same page with not making these promises - it costs her nothing to tell the sister she'd talk about it or look into finances or think about it and get back to her.  Setting future expectations is totally sensible.  The weird apology requirement is not.  It is not her sister's business whether your GF caused a problem with you with the promise or not, and there's no reason to publicize a disagreement or pull family into it, unless you're trying to find a worse fight.", "INFO: How serious is this relationship?

She\u2019s an adult not a child you have to enforce a punishment on. \n\nIt seems your gf thinks ur serious enough to consider y\u2019all\u2019s finances as combined and you disagree.

Even if it was a joint situation this is a big monetary commitment that she should have discussed with you before hand. \n\nThat being said I think it's a weird power trip to have her apologize to her family for wronging you. It wasn't right of her to do it, and if you for whatever reason you were unwilling to pay/unable to pay she would have to tell them obviously. But you are paying the rent, so literally all you get out of this is humiliating your gf. \n\nEither you two work it out together, or you split. You don't need to make your relationship problems public.\n\nEdit: ok looking at some of these comments kinda just makes me further agree with my judgement. Some of the comments and a response from OP make it sound like this is all to teach the GF a lesson or put her in her place. Look even if she did something wrong she is a person, and OPs equal. If you are in a relationship and you have a conflict the healthy goal is to resolve that conflict, not punish the other party. If you feel the need to put your significant other in their place (in this case kinda publicly) that's not how you should treat an adult person.
