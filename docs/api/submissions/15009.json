Your sister is in denial she definitely needs the therapy.", "You cant force someone to accept someone else as family.\n\nYou can encourage it, but trying to make it happen by force is only gonna alienate them more.", "NTA\n\n100% boys are doing this because of the incessant attempts to mesh them together.\n\nI have 4 step siblings with most of whom I never lived together and barely have a relationship (but have a great relationship with their dad). So I use step/siblings interchangeably depending on how much I care to explain to the other person. Because it's not a big deal at all.", "Why do they keep saying that they want to nip this behavior in the bud?  This is far beyond the bud. It is a full-fledged garden in bloom.  \n\nAlso, NTA.", "NTA. Yet another situation where people are upset their actual mixed family doesn\u2019t live up to their fantasy mixed family. By trying to force relationships, they just push them farther apart.", "\"Let's nip this in the bud\"\n\nMeanwhile, the hammer strikes have uprooted the neutral relationship that could have become friendly. In its stead, the flowers of enmity are in full bloom.\n\nAfter 8 years of marriage, which include 6 years of family therapy and open hostilities, there is no more bud to nip!\nOP you're right to stay out of it. NTA", "All of this! Seriously if they stopped trying the two of them might have actually found some common ground in their own but trying to force the issue has made it worse.", "I probably would have lost my mind if my parents got divorced and forced new siblings on me. I'm impressed kids do as well as they do.", "While I agree you cannot force a relationship, I very much dislike when people say \u201cthey didn\u2019t choose each other\u201d when talking about mixed families. This phrase gives power to the idea that it is permissible for step-siblings to be cold/rude/shitty etc. to one another because they didn\u2019t choose. If you think about it, even full Siblings don\u2019t have a choice in getting more brothers or sisters either; it is a choice also made by the parents. Also, As a child, you don\u2019t get to choose your parents either. So just because you didnt have a choice about these people in your life, doesn\u2019t mean the deserve to be treated badly. \n\nIt\u2019s better just to say \u201cyou cannot force two people to have a close relationship unless they both want it.\u201d Because in the end that truly is the bottom line. Whether full siblings or step siblings, neither had a choice and no matter how a relationship is labeled,  it only works if they both want it.", "My parents forced me to see my brother's therapist once when we were kids. She took the opportunity to blame me for all the bullying her received at school despite never actually seeing him during the day and not wanting to become a target myself. I didn't have a great view on therapists after that and it definitely negatively affected our relationship.", "My stepmother did this and somehow it was decided I was the enemy as the oldest or something. Hated the woman and her kids even more after that so yeah possibly and definitely did not appreciate being constantly attacked by the therapist and my stepmother each session.", "LMAO do they know why the kids don't like each other? Why they don't recognize their step bro?\n\nWhy would you risk souring your relationship with them? \n\nbtw they should have fixed this issue before getting married. NTA obviously", "NTA.\n\nI'd argue that she and BIL are pretty shitty parents for not letting the kids just be and accepting that parents getting together does not a magical blended family make.", "NTA. She can\u2019t make them be close and she\u2019s looking for a scapegoat.", "NTA. Tell your sister to stop lying to herself and her son and step-son. The boys are correct by saying they are not brothers and no amount of delusional behaviour from the rest of the family will change the biological fact that they are not siblings. It seems like the sister of the one who needs to be parented. It's lucky for them that they are only teenager and will soon be able to move away from their crazy family.", ">It's a pet peeve of mine when a divorced/single parent marries someone new and forces their kids to accept their new \"parent\" and \"siblings\". If your kid naturally gets along with them, that's great! But you can't force it. It isn't your kid's job to pretend to like someone just so you can have the illusion of a happy family.\n\n**Yet, you believe that someone should give their ring up to their STEP SISTER, because she thinks it\u2019s pretty, has no sentimental value attached and isn\u2019t related to the mother that left the ring?**\n\n**Oh, didn\u2019t you also belittle him for not wanting to give it up because that\u2019s all he has of her? Oh and didn\u2019t you say \u201cHis mother is dead. She has no feelings left to hurt?\u201d**\n\nEdit: Just because someone is **ill** doesn\u2019t mean it gives them the right to demand someone\u2019s personal and valuable items that were left to them by their deceased parent.", "I read a story recently about 2 little girls who are best friends, one with a mom, one with a dad. They suggested the parents go on a date, and the parents ended up getting married.", ">I'm really curious to know what happened in therapy that made them absolutely hate each other!\n\nPossibly [this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/012/166/getalong.jpg)?\n\nNTA", "To be honest, if years of pressure from both your sister and her husband and over two years of family therapy only worsened the boys\u2019 relationship, then I think it\u2019s extremely stupid to think that getting other family members to pressure them will help at all. All it\u2019s going to do is most likely negatively impact the relationship you and the rest of the family have with the boys and make them resent each other more. I did also see the comment about your sister blaming the therapists and now she\u2019s clearly blaming you and her other family members. In reality the only constant people in her son and stepson\u2019s lives she can truly blame for their bad relationship is her and her husband; for being more attached to the image of what they wanted rather than respecting their children and understanding that relationships can never be forced on anyone.", "Ok, so the bottom line is that they're NOT siblings, they clearly don't want to be and nobody can make them refer to each other as such and it's not your responsibility or your business to step in and say anything, so NTA!!!", "NTA and with a mom like that I can\u2019t imagine why they can\u2019t seem to get along. Lol.", "NTA, your sister and BIL are fighting a losing battle to the point of creating more animus between their kids!", "Exactly\n\nI came into my step kids lives when they were 17(m) & 13(f), 10 years later (5 years married) I've only ever said that if they want to come to me to chat about anything I'm here for them.  If we're chatting in general I give them my opinion which they are free to take or not take and I don't get offended (this type of advice is usually general life advice, never personal stuff).  Last year my step daughter gave me a fathers day card, just for being there for and making your mum happy.  I'm totally satisfied with that!", "Maybe OP can start writing the story. \ud83d\ude05", "NTA they are doing more damage then good and making the situation worse. Don\u2019t encourage your sister. Have you and your family out all your foots down", "NTA. I don't think anything is going to help at this point and your sister is only making it worse. The harder she tries, the more she is going to fail.", "NTA. The only shitty family here are your sister and her husband. By forcing those boys together, all she\u2019s ensuring is that they won\u2019t have anything to do with each other after they turn 18.", "NTA\n\nYou should tell your sister she's being ridiculous, but that it's fine because as soon as the boys turn 18 she and her husband will never hear from them again.", "Nope.  Typo.  NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Imagine if they just left the kids alone instead of trying to force it. The kids probably hate each other now because they were forced to interact", "Nip it in the bud? Girl this problem has flowered, fruited, and gone to market. Your sister needs to wake up and realize that smashing two kids that dislike each other together isn\u2019t going to magically reverse those feelings. \n\nNTA", "\"Dearest Sister, I am not their jailer or their Mother Superior. And this too shall pass.\"", "Thank you! I came here looking for this. The bud has gone through flower and fruit by now, and the birds have eaten the fruit and pooped out the seeds. Sister should be talking about breaking a habit at best."]}
