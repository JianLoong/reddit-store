I\u2019m a college student working a part time job at the movie theater which pays about 13 bucks an hour and I have other priorities to pay for so it\u2019s taken a while for me to save up. \n\nI\u2019d finally saved up the amount I needed and was planning on buying myself the perfume as a birthday gift (my bday was 2 days ago). I told my boyfriend (20m) this and he told me to go spend my money on something else and he\u2019d buy me the perfume instead. I told him he didn\u2019t have to considering it\u2019s expensive but he insisted. A few days before my birthday I asked him if he was sure about buying it and told him again that I had no problem buying it myself. He told me not to worry about it and said he\u2019d already bought and wrapped it. I thanked him and figured since he\u2019d already bought it that I could spend my money on something else. \n\nI took my best friend and my younger sister out to a nice restaurant and to the movies after. I wasted more than half the money I\u2019d saved up but obviously didn\u2019t think anything of it. So on my birthday my boyfriend gave my gift and it was a body spray and bath bomb. I asked him what happened to the perfume and he told me it was a lot more expensive than he\u2019d expected and way out of his budget. I got mad at him and asked him why he lied to me and told me to waste my money on something else when he could have easily told me he couldn\u2019t afford it and I\u2019d have bought it myself. He called me a spoiled brat and said I was expecting too much from him. I called him a piece of lying shit and left after that. I got a few texts from him and his friends calling me names and saying I\u2019m using him for money (??). I also got a text from his mom, who I had a great relationship with, calling me childish for throwing temper tantrums when I don\u2019t get my way.

This does not stop me buying guitars & amplifiers I don\u2019t really need, but I\u2019m not asking for anyone else\u2019s opinion, and I\u2019m buying instruments I can afford. My opinion - is that perfumes, and make up in general, are an collectively unnecessary adornment to alter the appearance of an individual - but on occasion, it\u2019s a treat for that individual, and perceptively the company kept by that individual. \u2018Fashion\u2019 is the same unnecessary industry. Both industries are climate criminals in the main, and I\u2019m content to move on from the concerns I had in my youth as to how I looked, and what did everyone think of my appearance; nobody really cared\u2026.\n\nI don\u2019t say this to be unkind. I really appreciate that it mattered to you that your boyfriend created a situation that was upsetting, and in relationship terms, you could both learn to understand one another better. But if money is something you currently have to manage carefully, then aspiring to buy or possess an expensive perfume can wait until one or both of you can afford \u2018it\u2019. Your boyfriend owes you an apology for being unkind, but there\u2019s also something in what he says that\u2019s worth considering. You\u2019re NTA in this situation, but I\u2019d encourage to reassess your aspirations. In the wider world, there are too many \u2018legitimate conspiracies\u2019 in every industry/market that we are collectively persuaded to believe in, that are simply not accurate, and therefore not worth our aspiration, or money.\n\nHope this is taken in good faith, and provokes a broader thinking.

I would\u2019ve been pissed too, it\u2019s completely ok to not buy you that perfume but not to lie about it and make you waste your money on something else then still try to get credit for \u2018a gift\u2019 that you didn\u2019t ask for", "NTA\n\nYou are too young to settle for someone who lies needlessly and causes you avoidable problems.", "So many red flags.

He could have told you to go ahead and buy the perfume and get you something more suitable for his budget and everyone would have been happy.", "NTA he's inconsistent and inconsiderate and trust me partners like that don't get any better", "I read the titles and expected to say YTA but actually no NTA he sounds difficult and untrue", "NTA you are literally the opposite of spoiled, should reconsider the relationship. Not cause he couldn't afford it but for lying about already buying it..", "I was like \u201cwow, bratty much?\u201d when I read the title but nope, not one bit\n\n\nHe is a liar and then got mad that you were disappointed, called you a gold digger despite you saying multiple times that you\u2019d get it for yourself and that it was expensive and sent his family and friends at you? Can you just stop calling him your boyfriend? He\u2019s obviously not mature enough to realise what he did wrong and why you\u2019re upset. He needs a bit more growing before getting into a committed relationship if you ask me, NTA", "NTA, He does not care about things that mean alot too you.", "Wait you are telling me you took three people to dinner in a good restaurant, then to the movies and you only spent half of what you would've for the perfume? My god how much does that thing cost?? Absolutely NTA btw but I'm really curious as to how much could a perfume ever cost.", "You should leave him. How everyone came after you when he was in wrong. It's disgusting. He is a terrible bf.", "I am sorry this happened to you!! He realy sound Ike a piece of work. He did lie to you and the he wants to call you spoiled? Wow.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but yeah I honestly think this would be a dumb reason to break up especially since you're both so young. You have maturing to do on both sides and perspectives to evolve, or maybe thats the point\n\nYou guys shouldn't grow together and should break up? Idk.\n\nIf you guys had no problems and have been together a good while a perfume shouldn't be why you break up. I'd say the fact he had his friends messaging you etc is pretty messed up though. If his mother did it I'd find it at least a bit more sensible but bringing friends in never really usually means normal and sane interests are at heart.\n\nNTA, just make sure you really consider the break up if you go through with it and you do have a reason to annoyed too ofc.", "NTA.  Dump his ass.  He can\u2019t even bother to apologize and getting others involved to rag on you", "NTA - And at the very least, his mom doesn't think you're one as well, **he probably just lied to her and to his friends**, just like he lied to you. He probably said something along the lines of \"Look at this expensive perfume! she's angry i wouldn't get this for her birthday present!\"\n\nYour boyfriend is a liar, an asshole, and doesn't respect your hobby, and probably you.\n\nIf you want to be sure, just text her saying \"I've been saving up for that perfume for X months and was about to purchase it when BF said he will get it, i tried to dissuade him but he insisted on me spending the money i saved on something else, and said he already purchased and wrapped it. So i spent the money. I'm not upset he didn't get it for me, i'm upset his lie means i need to save up for 1/2X months now, again!, wouldn't you be?\"", "I read the title and thought YTA for being spoilt but having read it you are NTA. He lied to your face. That is not ok. You dont make much money and you saved and saved for this luxury and you checked multiple times that he was ok to buy it. You should defo evaluate your whole relationship and see if this is the type of guy you want to be with. If he could lie this easily what else is he lying about", "NTA\n\nPretty much what everyone else here said, but I wanted to add that he probably lied to his family and badmouthed you, completely changed the story to make you look like a golddigger.", "ESH", "NTA. he bait and switched you and then involved his friends and mom to shut you up when you called his ass out. not cool and i\u2019d be dumping him over this.", "NTA he did indeed lie to you. When he learnt the item is too expensive to him, he should have notified you about the situation immediately so you can react properly. But the problem here is the kid had an ego related problem so he was not able to be truthful. Men and our egos. It is what it is. 100 % on him though.", "its a good idea to send the reddit posts to his friends just to come clean and not build a bad rep, he probably completely turned the story around and \u201cforgot\u201d to mention most of the details to them.. obviously NTA", "NTA - he literally lied, told you not to worry about it and to spend your savings somewhere else. Then gives you cheap body spray and a bath bomb..... \n\nHis friends are calling you spoiled and after his money? That's laughable considering he couldn't afford the perfume and you worked your ass off the save for it. \n\nHonestly I'd break up with him. You can't trust him, he brushes off your feelings, his friends harass/attack you. You deserve better.", "nta .. i wonder what story he told his friends and mom for them to feel that way. Not one of them could say they wouldn't be disappointed to be promised one thing and given another", "NTA\n\nThe only reason these people are taking his side is because they have only heard his side. He\u2019s obviously not going to tell them that he told you he had already bought it.", "NTA... I like the above persons advice on this... And honestly I go with that.\n\nYea its a red flag for sure...\n\nQuestion... Has he in any way said sorry?\n\nGoing foreword what is it that you want?\n\nIt easy for us all here to say leave him as we are not emotionally involved.\n\nBest advice I can give is to remember your heart and mind are not at war. They are still one...\n\nOne is saying I love him and the other is saying he lied to you.\n\nSo the question is do you want to forgive him or even though you still love him its a deal breaker and want to leave.\n\nAre close to your parents or another family member or close friend you know you can trust? That you could talk it through with?\n\nLet us know what you deiced. (I'm self confessed nosy bastard after all LOL.) \n\nGood luck and be well.", "He didn't just say he would get it, he said he *already had*. What a clown. Imagine being so desperate to be single.", "It\u2019s a totally other gift that he promised her", "What do you mean by thus", "It\u2019s not only about the perfume it\u2019s about he lied", "He is a liar and and will repeatedly disappoint you if he isn't already doing that.\n\nHe put zero effort into your birthday.   \n\nI bet you do a lot more for him than he does for you.", "He mislead you and then he badmouthed you to his friends and family while saying that YOU are in the wrong.  \n\n\nThis is way beyond just lying to you. He broke trust in the relationship and the way he's handling that I don't think he's planning on fixing the trust in your relationship.  \n\n\nBroken promises and lies should be deal breaker in any relationship. If you can't trust your partner then the relationship will turn toxic. Well it already turned toxic.\n\nNTA.", "Explain to his mom exactly what he did. I doubt he told her the truth. NTA", "If I were you I wouldn't even consider leaving him and just do it, especially how all his friends decided to get in on attacking you.", "He went full cheap ass and bought the cheapest thing that resembled the perfume", "I\u2019d send a link to this post to everyone who was mean then block them, dump his ass and enjoy your perfume for Christmas x", "$729 for the 100ml my lord. I\u2019m sorry he did this to you. You had the money and his lie set you back in obtaining this. You deserve better.", ">Baccarat Rouge 540 extrait\n\nWell I can see why he backed out of buying it! That ain't the cheap-stuff at all.  \nI'll have to make a note of it, my wife has been known to enjoy expensive perfumes.. Maybe she'd like this.", "You deserve better than a lying liar who lies. \ud83d\udc97", "He should've looked up the price before even giving the promise. Don't promise what you are not sure about if you can keep.  \n\n\nChances are he went to the store one or two days before giving OP the gift and found out the price, panicked so he picked something generic from the store.", "Yeah that\u2019s expensive! \u00a3235 in the uk. BF should have looked it up before making promises though."]}
