I\u2019m a college student working a part time job at the movie theater which pays about 13 bucks an hour and I have other priorities to pay for so it\u2019s taken a while for me to save up. \n\nI\u2019d finally saved up the amount I needed and was planning on buying myself the perfume as a birthday gift (my bday was 2 days ago).

I told him he didn\u2019t have to considering it\u2019s expensive but he insisted. A few days before my birthday I asked him if he was sure about buying it and told him again that I had no problem buying it myself. He told me not to worry about it and said he\u2019d already bought and wrapped it. I thanked him and figured since he\u2019d already bought it that I could spend my money on something else. \n\nI took my best friend and my younger sister out to a nice restaurant and to the movies after. I wasted more than half the money I\u2019d saved up but obviously didn\u2019t think anything of it. So on my birthday my boyfriend gave my gift and it was a body spray and bath bomb. I asked him what happened to the perfume and he told me it was a lot more expensive than he\u2019d expected and way out of his budget. I got mad at him and asked him why he lied to me and told me to waste my money on something else when he could have easily told me he couldn\u2019t afford it and I\u2019d have bought it myself. He called me a spoiled brat and said I was expecting too much from him. I called him a piece of lying shit and left after that. I got a few texts from him and his friends calling me names and saying I\u2019m using him for money (??).

This does not stop me buying guitars & amplifiers I don\u2019t really need, but I\u2019m not asking for anyone else\u2019s opinion, and I\u2019m buying instruments I can afford. My opinion - is that perfumes, and make up in general, are an collectively unnecessary adornment to alter the appearance of an individual - but on occasion, it\u2019s a treat for that individual, and perceptively the company kept by that individual. \u2018Fashion\u2019 is the same unnecessary industry. Both industries are climate criminals in the main, and I\u2019m content to move on from the concerns I had in my youth as to how I looked, and what did everyone think of my appearance; nobody really cared\u2026.\n\nI don\u2019t say this to be unkind. I really appreciate that it mattered to you that your boyfriend created a situation that was upsetting, and in relationship terms, you could both learn to understand one another better. But if money is something you currently have to manage carefully, then aspiring to buy or possess an expensive perfume can wait until one or both of you can afford \u2018it\u2019. Your boyfriend owes you an apology for being unkind, but there\u2019s also something in what he says that\u2019s worth considering. You\u2019re NTA in this situation, but I\u2019d encourage to reassess your aspirations. In the wider world, there are too many \u2018legitimate conspiracies\u2019 in every industry/market that we are collectively persuaded to believe in, that are simply not accurate, and therefore not worth our aspiration, or money.\n\nHope this is taken in good faith, and provokes a broader thinking.

I would\u2019ve been pissed too, it\u2019s completely ok to not buy you that perfume but not to lie about it and make you waste your money on something else then still try to get credit for \u2018a gift\u2019 that you didn\u2019t ask for", "NTA\n\nYou are too young to settle for someone who lies needlessly and causes you avoidable problems.", "So many red flags.

Dinner and a movie wasn't time sensitive and if you consider it a waste, you shouldn't have done it.\n\nWhat this guy did goes way beyond lying and beyond disappointing you on your birthday. **He got his mother and his friends to insult you and try to gaslight you for him, to cover up for his lies.** None of them are interested in the facts, because he was able to make himself the victim. This is a massive stop sign. **This is who he is.** He will try to show off, lie to you, not come through, throw you under the bus, tell others to shame you for believing him in the first place, and damage your relationships. Why? So he could look like a big man for a few days?? None of this was necessary. He just decided to throw some chaos into your life for no effing reason. I urge you to please at least take a break for a few weeks.", "NTA of course but I\u2019m here to find out which perfume it was \ud83d\udc40 I\u2019ve got the same hobby (obsession) and am saving up for a very expensive frag so I fully understand your disappointment", "NTA, you gave him every opportunity to back out of buying you a SPECIFIC ITEM that he would have known the price for in advance and he chose to tell you after you blew your money that he didnt get it for you", "ESH", "I can totally imagine how you'd be the asshole in his version: \"I knew she wanted the perfume, but I couldn't afford it. I tried giving her something nice within my budget and all she did was get mad at me\"\n\nBut you're totally NOT the AH here: if you really wanted something and even saved up for it, and then he literally tells you he already got it... Not a good sign, let's put it that way. \n\n100% not about the gift, but I would consider leaving over this lie.", "NTA.\n\nOn a slightly related note. Please make a retirement plan and go through finances. So many people are going to be absolutely screwed in a few years with wags stagnation and inflation. Save and invest what you can.", "NTA- \n\nI can't help but feel like this whole thing was premeditated to begin with.... Definitely seems like emotional abuse. Please don't stay in this relationship. \n\nThe skeptic in me is like, he probably saw this as an opportunity to confuse you, and then villainize you to everyone so you felt more isolated and reliant on him. It feels like he is trying to start financially abusing as well, and any time you want money, he'll paint you as a gold digger....Maybe I'm looking too much into it, but it feels super shady.\n\nEdit: grammar", "Straight to dumping? I think every long term relationship that started the the couple were young will have a few stories like these, if she wants to leave than she should, but I wouldn\u2019t push her towards it.", "I had two boyfriends in a row who did similar stuff like this. They'd say \"oh, I'll do X for you,\" and then when X never happened, I'd be left disappointed. I wasn't upset about X. It was always the lack of follow through. \n\nMy therapist told me that people judge themselves by their intentions, and others judge them by their actions. That stuck with me. Don't date someone like that.", "Absolutely NTA and he sounds like bad news. He lied about having bought the gift already when you asked, and now won't take any accountability for his actions and badmouthed you to people who are potentially important to you. Unfortunately this type of behaviour won't be isolated to this event.", "NTA, your bf has shown who he is, leave him.", "This is a clear situation of right and wrong. There is no grey here. You had the money for it, you don't need him for the money. After what he did and everyone blindly siding with him will be your future. Not a single person in that situation could see past loyalty to him to see his transgression. If he did that to them, they'd be singing a different tune. \n\nThey obviously have a problem with your perfume collection or else they wouldn't judge you like this. Had you been an antique collector of coins and he got you a chocolate looney rather than a expensive coin you were saving for to buy yourself, they might not have dismissed his behaviour as easily (they might have if they were even bigger AHs bc people often don't care about others hobbies), but at the end of the day it's not what you wanted. It's what he wanted. \n\n1. He put you in a false lull of comfort\n2. He lied more than once\n3. Never felt remorse\n4. He has a gang of blind followers who don't have an ounce of care for you and a whole glass for him\n\nEdit to add judgement NTA and you should break it off, you're still very young and this isnt who you want to be the love of your life.

You don\u2019t think ESH because OP wasn\u2019t \u201ctransparent\u201d about the cost of a product.

She didn\u2019t ask him to buy it. He offered to buy it, told her he already bought, told her to spend her savings elsewhere, but he never actually bought it.

We're talking about two broke college kids one who thinks buying a 200/400 bottle of perfume is ok, then let her boyfriend shoulder that without informing him of the cost and then got annoyed when he bought a more reasonable gift. \n\nShould he have told her? Yeah, but I'm still wondering why she didn't tell him the price outright when he was clearly trying to make a big gesture for her and then realized her bougie ass thinks shes worth a bottle of smell-good-juice costing hundreds of dollars?\n\nFuck all the way off with your condescension, you insufferable lurch.", "They always are when they\u2019re entire life is based around those things", "Using him for his money\u2026 what money lol he can\u2019t even afford perfume", "I mean atleast he doenst try hiding it, I guess?", "So this story is not one sided? Is there not a problem with his friends seeing her as going for his money?  Could she be after money?  I never commented on his actions just he went to his friends for advice and they talked to her. We don't know if he told them to but he want to someone for help with a problem in their private business and so is she.", "Maybe there is more to the story.  Maybe she really is after his money and his friends now had a chance to call it out even if he was wrong.  All I was saying is he want for advice from his friends and family they went after her.

You don't know what her life is based around \n2. No they're not\n3. You don't know her.

We will never know for sure. But I mean more so he is likely lying to his friends and family to make himself look better.\n\nThe truth is not always \"somewhere in the middle.\" Sometimes, someone simply lies. And someone is telling the truth. I wouldn't automatically assume OP is lying because she gives lots of details, specifics, and there is really no way he could clarify something to make himself look better given the sequence of events.\n\n>Could she be after money?\n\nThis guy is poor. You are reaching. He is the one that reassured her over and over again he would pay for something, and then didn't.\n\nListen, I think it's really obvious you have a bigger bias here at play. When you hear a story of a guy wronging a girl, you defend him at all costs, even if it makes no sense and you have to make up details for it to work out. Why do you think that is?\n\nAssuming all women are gold diggers, even when they're dating someone poor and not expecting much from them except for them to keep their word... shows you likely have a bias against women that you need to fix before it runs rampant.\n\n>We don't know if he told them to but he want to someone for help with a problem in their private business and so is she.\n\nAgain you are comparing apples to oranges. Talking to strangers vs. telling all your friends and family is way different. You know that, but you won't admit it because you're determined for OP's bf to be the victim. The idea that a girl can be telling the truth and the guy can lie, and actually be in the wrong, is offensive to you for some reason.", "I mean honestly for me this issue is that she had the money and she wanted to buy it for herself but she didn\u2019t because he lied. In my opinion the cost is irrelevant.", ">but you won't admit it because you're determined for OP's bf to be the victim.\n\nOh no he was completely wrong.  Let me ask you tho what says he's poor.  She's asking for a bottle of perfume that's $500. I doubt he thought it would be that high maybe 200 or 300.  So for a 20 year old to call him poor is a stretch.  \n\n>Listen, I think it's really obvious you have a bigger bias here at play\n\nSo let's look at it.  I said he's wrong but looked at the whole picture because my comment was about the friends and family messaging her about family business.\n\nHe asked friends and family who got pissed and said she's after his money.  They know both of them so they have an educated opinion of her.\n\nShe asked strangers like you who call a 20 year old poor because they don't have $500+ for a bottle of perfume.  Which she didn't mention the bottle or price in the post I found it in the comments and looked it up.\n\nThey both are looking for advice in their private matter.  That's what I was commenting on.  He fucked up by saying he would get it then doubled down by not telling her.", "Agreed.. he lied saying he\u2019d already purchased it (?! Like wtaf) i dont even have the words. Not \u201ci\u2019ll look into it\u201d or something along those lines. Literally \u201ci already *bought and wrapped* it\u201d. I could never rely on anything that man says again"]}
