There\u2019s one perfume I\u2019ve been wanting for quite some time now but it\u2019s been way out of my budget. I\u2019m a college student working a part time job at the movie theater which pays about 13 bucks an hour and I have other priorities to pay for so it\u2019s taken a while for me to save up. \n\nI\u2019d finally saved up the amount I needed and was planning on buying myself the perfume as a birthday gift (my bday was 2 days ago). I told my boyfriend (20m) this and he told me to go spend my money on something else and he\u2019d buy me the perfume instead. I told him he didn\u2019t have to considering it\u2019s expensive but he insisted. A few days before my birthday I asked him if he was sure about buying it and told him again that I had no problem buying it myself. He told me not to worry about it and said he\u2019d already bought and wrapped it. I thanked him and figured since he\u2019d already bought it that I could spend my money on something else. \n\nI took my best friend and my younger sister out to a nice restaurant and to the movies after. I wasted more than half the money I\u2019d saved up but obviously didn\u2019t think anything of it. So on my birthday my boyfriend gave my gift and it was a body spray and bath bomb. I asked him what happened to the perfume and he told me it was a lot more expensive than he\u2019d expected and way out of his budget. I got mad at him and asked him why he lied to me and told me to waste my money on something else when he could have easily told me he couldn\u2019t afford it and I\u2019d have bought it myself. He called me a spoiled brat and said I was expecting too much from him. I called him a piece of lying shit and left after that. I got a few texts from him and his friends calling me names and saying I\u2019m using him for money (??). I also got a text from his mom, who I had a great relationship with, calling me childish for throwing temper tantrums when I don\u2019t get my way. I honestly don\u2019t see how I\u2019m in the wrong here but I\u2019m not the type of person to not say sorry if I am.

Leave him.", "NTA. Your bf deliberately lied to you, promising you something you had wanted and could more than afford for yourself, and then was surprised when you reacted poorly. \n\nHonestly?

A microphone/megaphone and told you who he really is. \n\nI guarantee you can do and deserve better.

I just knew I was going to be rolling my eyes the entire time I was reading. \n\nI don\u2019t say this often, but get rid of him. You gave him every chance to come clean.
