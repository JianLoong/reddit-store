There\u2019s one perfume I\u2019ve been wanting for quite some time now but it\u2019s been way out of my budget. I\u2019m a college student working a part time job at the movie theater which pays about 13 bucks an hour and I have other priorities to pay for so it\u2019s taken a while for me to save up. \n\nI\u2019d finally saved up the amount I needed and was planning on buying myself the perfume as a birthday gift (my bday was 2 days ago). I told my boyfriend (20m) this and he told me to go spend my money on something else and he\u2019d buy me the perfume instead. I told him he didn\u2019t have to considering it\u2019s expensive but he insisted. A few days before my birthday I asked him if he was sure about buying it and told him again that I had no problem buying it myself. He told me not to worry about it and said he\u2019d already bought and wrapped it. I thanked him and figured since he\u2019d already bought it that I could spend my money on something else. \n\nI took my best friend and my younger sister out to a nice restaurant and to the movies after. I wasted more than half the money I\u2019d saved up but obviously didn\u2019t think anything of it. So on my birthday my boyfriend gave my gift and it was a body spray and bath bomb. I asked him what happened to the perfume and he told me it was a lot more expensive than he\u2019d expected and way out of his budget. I got mad at him and asked him why he lied to me and told me to waste my money on something else when he could have easily told me he couldn\u2019t afford it and I\u2019d have bought it myself. He called me a spoiled brat and said I was expecting too much from him. I called him a piece of lying shit and left after that. I got a few texts from him and his friends calling me names and saying I\u2019m using him for money (??). I also got a text from his mom, who I had a great relationship with, calling me childish for throwing temper tantrums when I don\u2019t get my way. I honestly don\u2019t see how I\u2019m in the wrong here but I\u2019m not the type of person to not say sorry if I am.

My way was to check in with him a few days before and ask if he was sure about buying the perfume and assure him I was more than happy to purchase it myself.  His way was to lie and tell me he\u2019d already bought and wrapped it.  My way was to give him every opportunity to let me know this wasn\u2019t in his budget.

Cut loose.", "NTA, I can understand the part where the perfume was out of his budget, it could have happened to anyone as we are not supposed to know how much everything costs and yeah, some things can cost much more than we could have ever imagined.\n\nAll he had to do was to come clean about it but instead he made up a lie about already have bought it.\n\nHe crossed the line a second time when he got his friends and mom to text you.\n\nDefinitely not the kind of relationship you should keep.", "He told his Mommy and his Mommy called to scold you for upsetting her baby.....?  That's just sad!", "Fucking leave him and Send this whole story to everyone so they all of the kind of shit he is. Then block all of them and live a happy life.", "NTA.

He messed up by lying and doubling down on the lie and telling you that you can spend your money. Since you had a good relationship tell her what actually happened then tell her you are breaking up with him. He just showed how childish and inconsiderate he is. I get he probably felt bad that he couldn't afford it but he should have said it or siad he needs more time to save for it. But he instead lied that he bought it. His gift may have been thoughtful but it was thoughtless because he lied about getting you the perfume and letting you spend your money", "NTA. It has nothing to do with his gift and everything to do with lying and misleading you. You offered to buy it yourself and he still said no he\u2019d get it.

Yeah right. You really don't understand how lying and trust works.\n\nNTA", "I agree he didn\u2019t have a clue.  But she told him it was expensive.  She even asked him again if he was sure.  In other words, she gave him an out.  Twice she told him she would buy it herself.  He told her he\u2019d already bought it.

He sounds awful", "Yeah, he wanted the insta-hit of his girlfriend's face lighting up and feeling like a great guy without having to do anything to follow through. Even though he knew it would bite him in the ass later. That's probably why he promised and promised and never once went back on it when he had the opportunity. And why he tried to make her feel unreasonable for the natural consequences of his actions. This is a man who feels entitled to zero accountability. And that's the *generous* interpretation. That's also why this is about so much more than a perfume. Who he's showing himself to be through this is not someone worth dating.", "AND big red flag that he is already siccing the mom on her.", "Except...we all know he only found out the price an hour or two before he gave OP the back-up gift.", "At the minimum, a lot got left out of the story he relayed. He probably was just complaining, saying, \"OP expected me to buy for a *insert price here* perfume. Then she threw a tantrum when she opened the gift I gave her!\" \n\nI'm sure he didn't explain how he promised it for her, reassured her over and over again, even telling her he got it already that she should use her money for something else (?!   This pisses me off so much)."]}
