Yes, you made effort to prepare a nice date, so I understand that you want it to be a happy occasion. But it's live and stuff happens. Turn your date into a \"session\" to help your SO with whatever shit is going down. They will appreciate it a lot, and it will help with getting over that event quicker (or at least cleaner).

You couldn't put in the effort to engage with her about what happened or how she felt, and then even knowing she was already so exhausted (physically and emotionally) that she hadn't wanted to do dinner in the first place, you said you \"didn't plan on her sleeping\" that night, because sex was the most important thing. \n\n\n\nMost likely, she wasn't just thinking about this one instance, OP. She was thinking \"So, this is how he's going to react every time I have a rough day at my extremely demanding job. This is what it will look like when I'm hurting down the road. This is the level of support and compassion I can expect if I stay with him.\" You showed her what you were offering, and she believed you. NGL, I'm proud of her.
