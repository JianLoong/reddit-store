He needs to live up to his responsibilities before he starts judging others.", "And now I see why you\u2019re divorced rofl. He\u2019s going to sue you over a $50 dresser?!?! NTA. It\u2019s not your job to furnish his place. If he can\u2019t provide the basics for your child\u2026then your child doesn\u2019t need to be spending the night at his place.", "NTA. You are correct on all counts.\n\nAlthough it sounds like it'd just be better if you didn't ask him for any favors. Have the friend you're giving it to or someone else help you with moving and packing. Problem solved.", "NTA. Your ex sounds shitty, and you aren't obligated to help him with this. You're absolutely right, *he* is responsible for providing his daughter with furniture at *his* apartment. You already told your friend they could have the set, and it would be pretty unkind to go back on your promise just because your ex is lazy and refuses to spend money on his kid.", "He was probably going to keep your nice bedroom set for himself and give your daughter his hand-me-downs. NTA", "NTA.\n\nCould you have given it to him for your daughter to use at his place? Sure. But it's not your responsibility to furnish HIS place, even if it is for your daughter. \n\nI'm not sure what the court would do in this case as they can't force you to furnish his house. Honestly, all that does is prove to the court that he doesn't provide the stuff your daughter needs to live there.", "*** my ex threatened to sue me because I file my daughter as dependent for taxes very year. She lives with me and I have full physical custody.", "NTA...if he wants to take you to court to sue you then you need to do the same and get the child support he owes he's not an a-hole but a jackass he has some nerve kids need to be provided for YEAR around not just Xmas and birthdays! So tell him if he's feeling froggish jump! He has more to lose by suing than you do owing over 8k in child support you can't do shit these days with $345 in child support a month as expensive as things are these days", "NTA. When he takes you to court he\u2019ll find out how much regard they hold for people who are in arrears on child support.", "NTA: He could have asked nicely. Maybe you would have give it to him?\n\nDifficult to judge withot knowing how much money he really has. Does he have other children? Does he pay you alimony on top of child support? Could he have payed for one himself in the first place or is he just really bad with money?\n\nWithout that... is is hard to judge. A friend of mine is basically impoverished. He has absolutly nothing. Lives in a one bedromm apartment and every cent he has goes towards his ex wife and children who also moved the children across the country. He cannot afford to move to them. But he pays up everything. No outstanding payments.\n\nAnother dude i know (not friend i just know him) basically throws his money out for everything and then complains about child support. While buying a new smartphone every year and driving a car that is way to expensive etc...", "NTA - He has a lot of nerve asking you for things when he is behind on child support and medical payments. People will argue that you are being an AH to your daughter by not making sure she has everything she needs when she is at her dad's house. That if he doesn't take responsibility during his care time, that you should be the bigger person and do it for him. But that is BS. Your daughter has a bed at her dad's house. That is all she needs for the 32 hours she is there twice a month. If your ex wants to make her feel more at home at his place, that is his responsibility - and he has had a decade to do something about it. \n\nI think its great that you are working hard to have a cordial co-parenting relationship for the sake of your daughter, but he is clearly not doing his part to keep that going. There is only so much you can do if he won't meet you halfway. As long as his lack of effort isn't putting your daughter at risk, you can let his actions (or inactions) speak for themselves.", "Nta, take him to court for the behind child support!", "Nta but didnt you sue him for child support instead.", "He\u2019s an ass and also wrong. Invite him to sue you, it will be a great opportunity to discuss all that child support he owes you. So, if you are in the US you probably have a parenting plan that lays out custody, visitation, child support, who claims the child for taxes, and most importantly- how you approach conflict resolution. Most parenting plans require mediation so if he wants to petition to change the parenting plan (which in most cases requires a significant change in circumstances), tell him to go for it. It\u2019s very likely the mediator (or his attorney) will let him know he doesn\u2019t have a case.", "NTA\nDude owes money for the support of his own child. He could try to sue, but I bet that would backfire spectacularly.", "INFO:  \nWhat is his financial situation?", "I don't want what kind of things were said in the argument so I'm going to ignore the \"suing\" part at the end (depending on any updates I may change my mind later).\n\nI'm going with NAH (regarding the furniture, he's a big AH for not paying child support)\n\nIt wouldn't be you gifting your ex, it would be you gifting your daughter. As long as the furniture was really going to be used by her, it would be a way of improving your daughter's living conditions while at her dad's.\n\nBut you're right that it's not your responsibility, it's his. But there's no harm in him asking for it. And that's why I said NAH.", "Did your daughter want it? If your daughter wanted the set and you opted to not give it to her out of spite for your ex, then YTA but if she didn't want it or didn't care, then definitely NTA and your ex is a huge A making a issue out of nothing.", "Well child support is going towards  supporting the child which I\u2019m guessing clothing is part of that equation!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There is no such thing as suing someone for not delivering something to which they are not entitled.  At most, he could ask the court to revise support or visitation.  Since he is behind, he has no leg to stand on.  How is he realistically asking to claim the daughter on taxes if he is paid under the table and no-one knows where he works.  This whole thing sounds so ridiculous.  Spent a few bucks.  Get a lawyer  Nip this in the bud.  Not sure why you are so \"cordial\" and hanging out with someone who does not and will not meet his obligations for supporting your daughter\u00a0", "Also, you can hire a private investigator to tail him and find out where he works.  This is not rocket science.  Try to be more active in pursuing your needs and those of your daughters.

You\u2019re enabling it.", "NTA, but do you think your relationship with your ex is healthy? You both need some better boundaries and the reason I say this is because you got into a married person fight doing things that married people do, and yet you\u2019re divorced. He was over helping you move? He frequently hangs out at your house, only the 3 of you? I know you think you\u2019re doing the right thing for your child but the lines here are so fuzzy. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re still fighting like you\u2019re married. Don\u2019t do that to yourself. Hold him accountable by setting boundaries and don\u2019t get sucked into fights. It\u2019s time for you both to move on from each other for the sake of your daughter.", "His threat to sue is empty.  If he files taxes he will have to declare income.  Any refund he would be owed would be \"captured\" by the state to be applied to his child support balance.  Also, he would be able to be garnished future wages.  \n\nI doubt he is going to file taxes and therefore his threat to sue has no merit.", "NTA.  He doesn't feel bad enough to buy her a bedroom set.  How hard did you laugh when he said he'd take you to court?", "Yup.....plus what kid that age needs a king size bed?", "Oh yeah it was a big mistake. I thought he would help out since I helped him out. Like driving him to get groceries, buying food for my daughter to take when she is at her dads, driving him to meet his friends,.. I thought we were getting along fine and that we are adults. So the first time I asked for help he gets mad at me because I didn't give him the bedroom set.. hmm..", "My first thought was that he's planning to try to sell it. I doubt a set that large would even fit in a small apartment.", "If you\u2019re in the US (not sure where you are), dependent status goes to where ever the child spends the majority of their time.

Let him sue and laugh him out of court.also bring up when you are there the missed child support and bills he owes ;) . NTA", "I\u2019d be shocked if any lawyer took his case to sue you.  You can always tell him you\u2019ll countersue for child support if he does.  Make sure you keep all receipts.  NTA", "Plus, if he's that behind what is he spending the money on?\n\nAlso, OP indicated it's a KING SIZE set so why would a kid that age need it?  Makes me think he wants to use it for himself.\n\nOP should do as suggested and take him to court for arrears and get interest.  I bet the judge will be none too pleased to learn that the \"dad\" is this far behind and has nothing for the kid in his house/apt yet wants to sue OP for not giving him the bedroom set (and will likely laugh his a** off)", "He works full time - construction/painting, two bedroom apartment. He does have another child who is 19, he never paid child support for his oldest.

He should be submitting pay stubs and other financials to the Court to fortify his alleged income and they should have a records of his payments. How did you even get a support order with no intel about his earnings?   You could also file your own petition to revisit custody and or support.   It sounds overwhelming but all the forms are online.  You can do it.    Have you reached out to legal support/Legal aide in your town?  You may qualify for help that way.  Are you incapable, financially, of paying for a lawyer? OR you just don't want to throw more money at it, which is understandable.  Sounds like you had a lawyer years ago but not since but that is just my assumption by reading your post.   When you are talking about years and years of missed support payments because of this mystery job, it makes sense to me to throw some money at figuring out what is what and then acting accordingly.  Good luck.", "Op, he needs to step up.", "You need to hold him to account. He is liable to pay that money for your daughter\u2019s care.  Stop letting him slide by and being a deadbeat.  How can you have respect for him and yourself when he is not paying what a court said he should **for your daughter**.", "In that case,  the law where we came from quite the same.  He can be free to work and not in jail if he can provide reasonable reasons to why he was behind child support and was force to have to find any job so that the court would auto debit his salary to the mother's child support account.  Usually its being monitored by officer or something like that.  Its like living in parole you know.  \nMaybe you can use that against him during argument  . Like \"i can put u in jail if u want to take me to court\" or something like that just to put him in place.", "He's going to be in for a surprise when he learns he still has to pay arrears even after the child is 18", "Or in lieu of jail and since he is employed, his wages can be garnered.", "Yeah that\u2019s rough .

Can his refund be taken?", "You need to get your lawyer involved hon NTA", "My first thought goes to the daughter. Yes, you should have offered at least the dresser, as it sounds like she already has a bed there. Is his house your responsibility? Absolutely not. But there\u2019s no need for your daughter to go without. However, on the other hand, she\u2019s only there once a week or so, so you\u2019re not really an asshole and he is obviously WAAAAY more in the wrong than you ever were, and you were *barely* wrong.", "Report his employer! Nta", "NTA. But you can take a day off and follow him and figure out where he works. Then contact his employer and tell him you have video proof he is working for him UNDER the table. So he needs to make him an official employee and send the appropriate child support. IF he decides to fire your ex, you will report him for workers comp fraud and provide said \"proof\" to the state contractors license board.", "NTA. The guy that owes you 11k in child support/medical expenses  thinks he can sue you? He's also cheating on his taxes if he's being paid under the table. He has way more to lose that you do if he shows to in a court room.", "Overall NTA. On the issue at hand, ESH. My dad was kinda like that but significantly worse. You're not gonna change him, he's not gonna change. You're highly unlikely to get what you're legally entitled to.\n\nYou can, however, slightly nudge the overall relationship to make it as positive as possible for the kid. You weren't obligated to provide for your daughter while she's with him, but you had an opportunity to do so. \n\nGoing forward, it's going to be a losing proposition for everyone if you think in terms of fairness & who owes what. Definitely protect yourself and don't be a doormat. At the same time, if there's opportunities that *cost you little and improve your kid's time with their dad*, that's potentially valuable for them.", "He wants your bedroom set for himself.", "op=NTA\n\nFeck him.

You need to stop this naivety.", "The fun part is that he's getting paid under the table, so what is he reporting as income?  to file a proper tax return?  OP should call the IRS and sick them on his butt.", "The county already suspended his driver's license,  federal and state taxes offset, locating him, credit reporting, Passport denial, etc.. since the county already have the offset if he does get a refund it is automatically sent to the county and then sent to me. But for the last 8 years I have not gotten anything from federal or state taxes. So I doubt he files taxes."]}
