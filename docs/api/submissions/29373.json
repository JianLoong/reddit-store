I have a daughter Layla (6) and she has three daughters Hina (14) Risa (9) and Lara (5). We waited a year before meeting the kids.\n\nFor context, I've always been affectionate with Layla. My family showed no love when I was a kid and I didn't want that for Layla. Obviously I was careful not to initially do any of it with the other girls, but I tried to get along with them. It went well and we moved in together around six months ago. I thought it went well.\n\nLayla and Lara always got along, but got basically inseparable since moving in. And Lara basically insists that I treat her the same (hugs, kisses, praise, etc.). Risa sometimes wants affection, sometimes doesn't, so I've just let her lead, and I thought it went fine. The most it gets is a hug on the couch generally.\n\nHina is basically a typical teen, acts like we aren't cool and don't understand her. Honestly I didn't think she liked me, but last month she asked if they (the sisters) could call me dad. I agreed to make her happy. Though I was surprised because their father is involved in their lives.\n\nAya's brother came to visit this week. Seeing the affection and hearing them call me dad he got mad. He thinks how I'm acting is creepy and problematic. That we are hurting their real father with the name, when he's done nothing wrong. Basically accusing us of trying to replace him in their lives.\n\nI think he's being over the top, and none of what I'm doing is crazy. The affection I describe surely isn't crazy? The dad part I can kinda get, but the girls asked for it I didn't force them to. I would have ignored it but he got the rest of the family on her case. We've been ignoring the calls but a part of me is worried that I may have messed up. I'll never have to worry about Layla having a stepfather so I don't really know how I'd feel in this situation. Even if he doesn't sound great from what I know, I wouldn't never say their father is bad or anything. Aya is on my side and think her family should butt out, but she definitely doesn't like their father to begin with.\n\nWhile I've been treating the girls the same, a part of me is worried that I should listen to her brother.", "created_utc": 1697898087, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17d3nrm/aita_being_affectionate_and_letting_my_gfs_kids/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sound like a real one dude. NTA. Keep showing up for the girls and doing your best.  Let this blow over if possible.  Situations like this are hard and dicey. You wanna stay out of that and continue putting that energy into whatever it is you do that made the girls want to call you Dad. And encourage their relationship with their bio dad.", "The girls seem to trust and appreciate you, so you have been doing everything right. It was their choice to call you dad. The brother is the AH in this.", "NTA.  Stepdad here, you let the kids lead the way on this which is exactly what you should have done.  This is particularly the case since Aya is on your side.  You did nothing wrong here and ignored the flying monkeys.  There was a reason they asked you.  Should be very proud and honored.", "Nta The step kids were trying to find a name which showed aderment  toward you other than your first name. Perhaps having them call you poppa, pops, or any name other than dad would soothe the extended  family. What does bio dad say?", "NTA you let the kids decide when they wanted affection from you and the kids ASKED to call you dad. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. People have varying opinions on what is and isn\u2019t okay with kids that aren\u2019t others biologically. They know who their dad is. Obviously they think you\u2019ve been a father to them to ask to be able to call you dad. You can explain that to the brother but he might not listen and there\u2019s a chance you could put the other kids in the middle by telling him they asked to call you dad. How you handle that\u2019s your choice but also be ready for him to still oppose the situation.", "NTA. In fact the opposite. There\u2019s no rules saying you can only call 1 person in your life dad. It\u2019s also easier in the family dynamic. And if it\u2019s what the kids want, who cares? \n\nGood for you for treating all the kids the same! It\u2019s not weird or creepy. It\u2019s awesome. Who cares what bio dad think. If he has a problem with it, then he is very unsupportive in his children\u2019s needs. Honestly the more positive adult male interactions young girls have the better they will be equipt to deal with life as an adult. \n\nKeep on keepin on and you\u2019ll probably be the favorite dad.", "I never hurts to hear another person\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s your choice whether or not you listen to them. \n\nThe only goal is this equation should be whatever is best for these 3 kids. Those kids have a voice but they also have 2 parents. You are not one of those, neither is brother so the both of you will need to defer to their parents decisions. \n\nYou\u2019re a Dad \u2026 how would you feel if your daughter started calling someone else Dad? It\u2019s definitely worth taking a minute to think about.\n\nNAH \u2014 blending families is not easy nor simple.", "You were NTA the moment you said \"sometimes she wants affection, sometimes she doesn't. I let her take the lead\"\n\nLet the kids lead. They ask you for affection. They asked to call you \"dad\". Their wants in this subject come above and beyond what distant relatives think. Your gf's brother probably has his own issues, either he's a flakey father himself or is still friends with their flakey birth father. Whatever the reason he has no say in it - nor do the relatives calling you on your phone.\n\nTrust the kids to make this decision for themselves, I hope you continue to have a good combined family together.", "NTA, the girls asked to call you that.  \nCan we just stop for a second to be excited for you that A MOODY TEENAGER asked to call you dad, even with her bio dad around?\" THAT IS SUCH an awesome milestone in your relationship with these girls. I'm glad your blended family is working out so well. Congrats! I'm sure it's a testament to the care you show them.", "NTA\n\nI mean..the kids initiated this on their own. You didn't do anything to pressure them to.\n\nExcept ask Aya if you can read the custody agreement. They usually spell out the amount of time the divorcees need to wait in new relationships before introducing kids to new partners.", "That's a tough one. I'm going to say NTA, because there was no bad intention behind it and  the kids asked, but seeing as their dad is still in their lives it was probably poor judgment on your part to just agree without trying to have a more in-depth conversation about it. If I'd been in your shoes I'd probably have replied something like \"you already have a dad and I'm worried he'll feel hurt, don't you think it's a bit unfair to him?\"", "NTA I guess, but I have to say it's super weird with their father involved in their lives.\n\nJust curious what he thinks of this.", "NTA - You're clearly a better father than the ex.", "Wait, your gf's brother is defending her ex that she doesn't like? That alone is weird. I will say you never should have taken the \"Dad\" name. They have a \"Dad.\" You should've pointed that out to them and suggested maybe a different name for you, like Pop or Papa or something. I know kids that melded their step-dad's first name with the word dad. Maybe something like that.\n\nIn any case, NTA because you were only thinking of them and trying to make things good for them.", "NTA. It sounds like Aya came from a family that didn\u2019t do affection, and that\u2019s probably why her brother finds the affection weird. But there also are some pretty gross statistics about stepfathers and bad things happening to young girls, and if he knows that he\u2019d be looking for signs anyway, maybe. If you\u2019re not doing anything wrong, I feel you should keep treating the girls like your own kid, letting them lead as you have been. The worst thing you could do is be secretive snot the affection, because that would be a big red flag that you had something to hide. \n\nAs far as them calling you Dad when original Dad is still around, that is strange. It makes me wonder why they asked you that. Original dad might be as bad as your girlfriend says. I do think it would be more politic to go with a slightly different name if you could come up with one, like Dad John or something. I don\u2019t see this as an obligation, though. \n\nAlso, your girlfriend was with original dad long enough to have kids. It\u2019s very possible her brother is friends with him, which would affect how he sees you.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nTo be clear, I don't think you're a bad person. I love that you're trying to put the girls first, and under most circumstances I would absolutely suggest following their lead in terms of both physical affection, time spent together, and what they call you.\n\nBut I think what a lot of people here are missing is that *you're not their stepfather*. \n\nYou're their mother's boyfriend.\n\nAnd yes, you've been with her for two years, but you've only lived with those kids for 6 months, and have no legal relationship with them and have made no legal commitments to them. \n\nAt this point - and again, I say this gently and with kindness, because you seem to really care - as someone who has worked with kids for over 30 years, I suspect that their asking to call you dad so soon, *especially* the teenager, has more to do with their craving for stability and a reliable father figure than with you, personally. Like, I'm sure that your love and kindness matter a lot, but also, given that they have a father in their life, who their mother has denigrated and said is not a great dad . . .these are clearly kids who are ready to glom onto any male figure who they think can be a source of stability and a \"real dad\" that theirs isn't being. \n\nAnd honestly, YTA for *letting them believe that of you* when you haven't actually committed to them as a family. Because right now you could walk away at any moment and choose never to see them again with absolutely no consequences, and now that they call you \"dad\" and not just your name, and have been encouraged to see you as a father figure, it would absolutely DESTROY them.\n\nAnd my feelings about this were cemented by your comment that \"well yeah, any breakup could go badly\". Because clearly you don't have any idea what kind of door you've opened with these poor girls. If you broke up with their mother now, it wouldn't be \"upsetting\" . . . they would feel like they were *being abandoned by a parent*. All because you allowed them to think of you that way. \n\nYTA, not for loving them, but for selfishly and immaturely establishing a parental relationship with kids when you aren't their parent and haven't established any real responsibility for them or obligations to them. You're enjoying the feeling of them adoring you, but you haven't committed to them in the same way they've committed to you. And that's heartbreaking.", "If you married, then this would not be as bad. But, moving in with a girlfriend, this seems like you are just playing house. My worry is how hurt the kids would be if this relationship doesnt work out. They have bought into having you as a new dad, but you havent committed to it yet. This is a recipe for disaster. \n\nSo imo, YTA for stringing these kids along.", "NTA, sounds like the son is a mini version of the father", "Exactly: OP hasn\u2019t thought about long term commitment. He sees ZERO value in the term \u00ab\u00a0Dad\u00a0\u00bb. He doesn\u2019t feel invested of any responsibility towards the girls. I\u2019m sorry for all the children involved.", "INFO: Why would you care about anyone's opinion except the kids' mom?", "YTA. You have only been together 2 years, you are not married, and they have a dad who is active and present. Lots of kids ask step fathers to be dad (including me btw) but you aren't even that. You should have explained to them that they have a dad, and while you love that they see you that way, maybe they could  come up with some cute nickname they could call you instead.", "YTA. It\u2019s not appropriate for them to call you dad. They have a dad. You should have come up with a different name.\n\nEdit: If my ex got a girlfriend and the kids called her mom, I would lose my shit. I am shocked by all the NTAs. Just because it\u2019s nice they asked, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right thing to do. You\u2019re not even married ffs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Youre becoming a father figure in their lives and it\u2019s clear they appreciate you. On another side, I would be uncomfortable if my children were calling my ex\u2019s bf of 2 years dad. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem for 2 father figures in a child\u2019s life.  I think a mature conversation with the dad on son would be nice. Just to clarify you\u2019re not trying to replace anyone and you respect his role as a father. You said you dont have to worry about Layla having a stepfather.

I just wasn't sure if that's the correct approach or just her bias against him.", "I'm not disagreeing on that. It's why I'm getting outside opinions.", "I know he's in the picture for the kids but not for her as in she'd rather he not be involved. As long as you don't bad mouth him to the kids you're fine. The kids are allowed to bond with you and you with them", "I don't think not caring what your ex thinks is necessarily bad parenting. Everything depends on one's individual circumstances.\n\nSounds like you're doing a fine job with all the kids.", "Regardless of how Aya feels, you need his opinion specifically.
