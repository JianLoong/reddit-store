Take off your shoes and give them to me' \n\nNope you dont owe her nails or anything else. And for her to cry like that and accuse you of that is absolutely delusional and ludicrous!", "NTA.  What and who are two 18 year olds trying to impress in Thailand?", "NTA, she\u2019s cray cray", "What did I just read?!\n\nNTA", "NTA, That\u2019s a really weird request. Tell her to go to the local store and pick up some press on nails.", "I\u2019m starting to think all of these are fake.", "NTA, but ... what? She thought you could take off acrylic nails and use them as press-ons? She couldn't find either a nail salon or a drugstore that sold nail glue or press-ons in a popular tourist area? None of this makes sense.", "NTA - girl got some nerve to be even suggesting you rip your nails off!! What on earth is she thinking.", "Nta. Why would you even consider yourself to be one", "NTA\n\nYou friend is unhinged", "No you are not an asshole. But you may be if you keep being friends with a brat like this.", "NTA. Your friend is entitled and delusional.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I don\u2019t know what to think about the situation. \" What a ridiculous idea of that entitled AH. - Why would you ruin your nails for her?", "That's gross NTA.\n\nYou can't just \"take off\" an acrylic nail like that. Because of how the nail is etched during prep, the acrylic sinks into the little grooves. Its bonded to the nail stronger than glue! \n\nTo take it off in one piece you'd have to pry it off (which could break it, or rip your natural nail,  and even if you dont break it you'd still be weakening you nail) which would take off some of your natural nail plate with it. I doubt she has the tools to drill the underside of the nail and smooth the nail to even make a press on (and remove bits of your nail from it). Also any kind of nail extension is made **to your specific nail**. There is no telling if it'd match her finger. And even if it did, again, ew!! Just ew!\n\n\nShe's literally asking you to tear your fingernail off for her to wear!! It's unhygienic, risky (if too much of your nail comes up with the acrylic your nail will be super flimsy and thing, and *HURT*). Ask any nail tech about this and they would call her nuts for suggesting it.\n\nYou need to find better friends. Ones who won't ask you to injure yourself for their vanity. Her reaction afterwards is just the icing on the crazy cake. If her nail bothers her that much why doesn't she rmove them all and buy some *actual* press ons at a nearby store?", "Nta agree on the cray cray comment", "NTA, I don\u2019t know how press on nails work. You said \u201cmake,\u201d but I\u2019ll assume you meant \u201cgive\u201d. Your friend was overreacting massively.", "NTA for the nails. Maybe TA for not having compassion for your friend\u2019s extreme distress? Shes clearly suffering some sort of episode and needs mental health intervention. Do you even care?

Plus if she didn\u2019t want her manicure to look messed up, she could have gone to a salon to get them removed instead of making you take off your nails so that she could have a full set again", "She must not think very highly of you if she thinks you're doing this on purpose to make her look bad.", "Definitely NTA,\nI don\u2019t understand how anyone can ask that. Can I ask why she didn\u2019t just do regular gel instead of acrylic if she couldn\u2019t find a good enough tech?", "No you are not. But this is her and what her inner voice thinks.

This happened to Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes and they ended up in a Thai prison.", "Why cant she use her own nails for press ons?", "NTA. And your friend do sound unhinged. Absolutely no good nail techs in a highly touristc area of a highly touristc country? Google her 5* nail salons - that's all the help you can be expected to give."]}
