Though we have options such as Burger King and McDonald\u2019s, my friend didn\u2019t want these options. He texted to ask but I was busy so I didn\u2019t answer.

My friend claimed it was an emergency because he had a \u201cbig headache\u201d and it was raining, and didn\u2019t think he could drive an hour without eating even though he had a variety of options that didn\u2019t involve virtually breaking into my house to eat my food.

My fiancee and I asked for our keys back because we don\u2019t feel safe with a person like this having access to our home. He offered to pay back the cost of food, but I was still so flabbergasted I didn\u2019t bother answering. \n\n\nThat was yesterday. Today, he still hadnt returned the keys so my fianc\u00e9e called him and he said he\u2019d give them back after work. She *did* cuss him out too, but I don\u2019t feel bad. She\u2019s pregnant and mama-bearing- this could\u2019ve been so much worse. If my ex friend is *this* entitled when she\u2019s pregnant? What will happen when the kid is born?\n\n\n**YTA.** Congratulations on ruining two friendships because you were too boojie to eat at McDonald\u2019s. Like my mom always said, if you\u2019re so hungry you can\u2019t drive, but are too good for certain foods, you aren\u2019t **really** hungry.

You can\u2019t just randomly go into a friend\u2019s home and steal their food without talking about it first.", "OP ate the friend\u2019s food.", "At least OP did the dishes /s", "I mean rather than apologize OP tried to justify his actions and then told his friends not to interrupt him. Ya I\u2019d end my friendship over that inconsiderate bs. Pretty sure this is all one sided so I\u2019d like to hear why the friends suck in your opinion.", "They overreacted because they are mad about someone breaking into their home and stealing their food?", "How is the friend also an ah? Because they didn\u2019t say to not break into their home to steal their food?", "I was on the fence until then tbh, just because I probably wouldn't mind if a friend or relative came to mine to cook some food on the way home, but to not bring your own food, and to only offer to pay them back AFTER you knew they were pissed? AH move, especially since fiancee is pregnant. I have severe appetite problems, so I need to know what food I have at home, and I'm guessing pregnant people are similar what with cravings/nausea etc.", "This shit is exactly why I revoked my open door policy with my friends. Had one of my ex\u2019s  buddies go in while we were at work and eat an entire brand new box of cereal, a whole bag of my chocolates (The ex and I would buy separate snacks because we didn\u2019t really like the same things), take a shower and watch some tv. We came home and he was passed out on the couch. Like you couldn\u2019t have bothered to ask if it was cool that you go over to our place while we\u2019re not there? Ask if it was OK if you eat anything? Literally just ask??? Now, I very rarely invite people over And my food is 100% off-limits to everybody except people that actively live in my house and contribute to the grocery bill. if anyone is taking food, they are not offered, they are asked to pay back the cost of the food and told to never fucking come back again.  I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t work hard to pay for my shit for you to just come take it freely without asking or being offered.", "Right? For some reason I was imagining them bringing in their own microwaveable meal - this is even worse.", "\u201c I feel like it was an emergency\u201d\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t. How in the world is you not wanting McDonald\u2019s an emergency. Threw your friends trust away cause you didn\u2019t want to buy Burger King. \nYTA", "If there were fast food joints I'm sure there was a gas station he could've bought some fruit from.", "Who tf thinks to themselves that it's perfectly fine to go to someone's home while they're not there and eat their food because you work hard and don't want fast food? \n\nI mean, besides OP. That's some next level entitlement right there, and to then get all pissy because they have perfectly reasonable boundaries. OP is giving off some massive narcissistic vibes.", "This! Really buried that info until the last paragraph. I would be pissed!", "For real. The title is so misleading. They didn't just go in and use the microwave, they went in and *stole their food*.", "This is so weird. I don't care how much of a foodie you are, there is nothing wrong with a small fries from Burger King if you are starving.", "I didnt realize that at first, and then it made it all that much funnier!", "Yeah, but he did the dishes/s", "For real. The title is so misleading. They didn't just go in and use the microwave, they went in and *stole their food*.", "Oh, but he cleaned up and did the dishes \ud83d\ude44 \ud83d\ude42", "I missed that bit! Even worse!", "OP is all about me me me in their language. Their emergency, how they felt, how they assumed it was fine. I doubt they'd realize if a real emergency hit them in the nose. \n\nOP shouldn't have ever been given a key. They just let themselves in, ate their friends' food without waiting for permission first, then tried to make it seem like they were the victim of extenuating circumstances in this scenario somehow? Like who does this? How do you not feel guilty after taking their food without permissions?", "Right? Like the food around not meeting your food standards isn\u2019t an emergency. Lmao. \n\nDude (original op of post) has no respect. Of course, I wouldn\u2019t care if my best friend did this, but they obviously don\u2019t have that type of friendship. Insanity that he didn\u2019t know his relationship with his friends enough to know what would or not be okay, I feel like he texted because he knew it would probably be a problem. Anyway, great comment!", "That's what really got me. It wasn't even that OP had no other options, they just preferred to go steal from their friend instead.", "The only reason op gave for not eating at ANY of the SEVERAL available fast food places was that they just didn\u2019t want them. What a tool.", "i figured i just wanted clarification to be sure. since i've jumped to conclusions before and have been dead wrong about it.", "And I didn't think it could get worse.", "Then YTA", "Yeah, his wording had a real \"im Sorry your so offended\" rather than \"im sorry for what i did\" kid of vibe to it. \n\nOne is an apology, one is a sign of more transgressions to come.", "Is there something wrong with not wanting to be interrupted? I mean that is just common decency. \n\nI think you can explain yourself and still apologize. I dont think explaining/giving context is = to making excuses. \n\nI think OP is sorry. I doubt he would do it again if he realized this would be the out come. \n\nI think the friend sucks for not allowing a conversation. Friends let friends know they fucked up but then they allow them to apologize and move forward. \n\nI dont see where the friend even was looking for an apology. Just wanted to go off.", "Even if you would be okay with your friends doing it, it\u2019s still not okay unless someone has express consent to do it.", "\u201cFor some reason\u201d I think that reason is being a decent human being. Until I read about OP offering to pay them back I also didn\u2019t want to believe someone would randomly break into their friends\u2019 home to steal their food.", "I know, I just assumed they brought a burrito or something but nope. It's a little hilarious that someone would think to do this ngl", "I think initial anger is completely justified. What if OP walked in on him and his fiancee during an argument or having sex or something? What if OP ate a meal that his friend and his fiancee were planning on having that night? What if OP started snooping around or saw something he wasn't supposed to? \n\nOf course they didn't want to hear excuses the night it happened. I think it's perfectly fine to allow his friend and fiancee to tell him off because it was such a huge invasion of privacy and a breach of trust. OP getting defensive was entirely the wrong way to handle it since he WAS in the wrong.\n\nPlus, OP said that he told them it was no big deal...uh, yeah, it IS a big deal.", "I didn't say it was, I said I wouldn't be bothered by it. That's my opinion. Obviously you disagree, no problem.", "I just personally cant imagine having the level of friendship that you ask that friend to be there in case of an emergency but be so angry you cant talk to them over this. \n\nHe called first. He knocked. He wasnt trying to be sneaky. He wasnt snooping. I think that it was a honest misunderstanding on OPs part that he didnt think they would mind. Im not OP but I do have friends who could do this to me and I wouldnt care. Its possible for friends to be okay with this. Op is defensive and should just accept his friends right ro be upset but I think he really didnt think it was a big deal. Whether he is right or not. He was surprised by his friends reaction. \n\nOP was obviously wrong. Op is maybe a bit dense. He is an asshole for arguing that it was no big deal. \n\nI guess it doesnt feel like a friendship ending issue to me personally.", "It also doesn't say anywhere that OP's friend ended the friendship. Just that they took the key back and is ignoring his texts right now (rightfully so; he can't trust OP to not barge into their house anymore and the incident just happened). Maybe the friendship is over, OR both need more than 16 hours to calm down.", "   You are right about them not saying they didnt want to be friends. They never explicitly said that but to me it seemed implied.\n\n   I think taking the key is justified but also a bit dramatic. Misreading a situation and making a mistake is much different than making a mistake, being asked not to do it, then doing it any way.  That would 100000% make OP the biggest of assholes. If you felt your friend would intentionally do something like that, why would they be the person you trusted in an emergency in the first place? \n\n    You dont have to agree. I have read the majority of the opinions here and realize Im unpopular. Unpopular or not. It is just my opinion.\n\nI dont know why that gray box appeared.. just fyi haha"]}
