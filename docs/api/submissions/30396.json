My fianc\u00e9 (24m) wanted to upgrade our car to a BMW, Audi, or a Mercedes which are all double what we were paying before hand! Money is very tight at the moment too with Christmas around the corner and my partners job isn\u2019t very stable at the moment. We will get a payout off my insurance which will pay off the outstanding finance on my old car and leave about \u00a3500 as a deposit for a new car. Now my issue is my credit rating is worse now than it was when I took out my first finance and I won\u2019t get approved for it now so have to buy outright. Obviously with \u00a3500 we won\u2019t be able to do that. So my dad said he would buy a car up to \u00a34K and I could pay him back monthly to save paying interest on finance if I was to get approved. Great right? I can get a car sooner and not worry about my credit rating. Only my fianc\u00e9 (24m) who doesn\u2019t drive!!! Wanted to go over budget for a \u201cnice\u201d car and doesn\u2019t see that we can\u2019t do that as my dad is doing a nice thing by offering a \u00a34K budget. So I found a car which was \u00a34K, low mileage, big enough for the kids car seats, big boot space and good on fuel and managed to get the seller down to \u00a33.6K which we\u2019ll be able to pay off in 2 years to my dad. \nProblem is my partner said not to get it if it was more than \u00a33.2K cause he doesn\u2019t like the way it looks (remember he doesn\u2019t drive) and I said I\u2019d cut off at \u00a33.5K but for the sake of \u00a3100 I now have a safe, reliable, cheap to run car that I feel safe to pit the kids in but now he\u2019s not speaking to me cause he doesn\u2019t like the car.

I'd keep him, too.\n\nIf you keep the fiance, put a hold on any marriage plans and do not make any more babies with him until he improves.", "NTA. You aren't married yet and your dad offered to pay for the car. When your fiance marries you, has a stable job and income AND starts driving, then he can buy whatever car he wants. You went within budget, who cares what it looks like as long as it gets you from point A to point B. And tell fiance he doesn't ever have to sit in the vehicle. He can walk wherever he needs to go.", "NTA. Your partner has nothing to do with this transaction. His aesthetic opinions about the vehicle are irrelevant, and if he doesn't like the very good deal that you found and the generosity of your father, then he can be sure not to benefit from the car, which means no rides, no eating groceries fetched with it, nothing.

Your level of financial responsibility are not anywhere close to the same.", "NTA and I have a sinking feeling your credit has declined due to being in a relationship with an adult adolescent (silent treatment; fancy fantasy cars) who expects you to maintain him in a certain lifestyle.

Cars are depreciating assets the moment you drive them off the lot, so whether it\u2019s new or used quite frankly unless the two of you are making like $100k+ with a decent amount of savings in bank you\u2019d be very stupid to drop that much of your income on a luxury car.
