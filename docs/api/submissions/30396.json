We will get a payout off my insurance which will pay off the outstanding finance on my old car and leave about \u00a3500 as a deposit for a new car. Now my issue is my credit rating is worse now than it was when I took out my first finance and I won\u2019t get approved for it now so have to buy outright. Obviously with \u00a3500 we won\u2019t be able to do that. So my dad said he would buy a car up to \u00a34K and I could pay him back monthly to save paying interest on finance if I was to get approved. Great right? I can get a car sooner and not worry about my credit rating. Only my fianc\u00e9 (24m) who doesn\u2019t drive!!! Wanted to go over budget for a \u201cnice\u201d car and doesn\u2019t see that we can\u2019t do that as my dad is doing a nice thing by offering a \u00a34K budget. So I found a car which was \u00a34K, low mileage, big enough for the kids car seats, big boot space and good on fuel and managed to get the seller down to \u00a33.6K which we\u2019ll be able to pay off in 2 years to my dad. \nProblem is my partner said not to get it if it was more than \u00a33.2K cause he doesn\u2019t like the way it looks (remember he doesn\u2019t drive) and I said I\u2019d cut off at \u00a33.5K but for the sake of \u00a3100 I now have a safe, reliable, cheap to run car that I feel safe to pit the kids in but now he\u2019s not speaking to me cause he doesn\u2019t like the car.

He can walk wherever he needs to go.", "NTA. Your partner has nothing to do with this transaction.

Cars are depreciating assets the moment you drive them off the lot, so whether it\u2019s new or used quite frankly unless the two of you are making like $100k+ with a decent amount of savings in bank you\u2019d be very stupid to drop that much of your income on a luxury car.

And when the lease ran out, she was left with no car to drive and horrible credit from putting her name on all the loans and bills they had.  She now drives a decrepit Yaris that\u2019s literally running on a prayer and pixie dust (or necromancy, could go either way) because she still has awful credit and no savings thanks to him.  She\u2019s lucky she even has a car to drive honestly. \n\nAnd her ex husband was a total narcissist.  He was emotionally abusive, financially abusive, and completely neglectful to their child.  There\u2019s still no proof but it\u2019s very evident that he cheated on her with his now wife.  He was not a good man in any way, shape, or form but he was very good at being charming and hiding what a snake he was.
