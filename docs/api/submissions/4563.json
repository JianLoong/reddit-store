My son has no interest in playing football but he says he likes being in places where there are a lot of tall boys because he thinks being short is funny. So, when my husband told him a lot of the boys in the party were going to be tall, he wanted to go but he didn't play football with them, just watch from outside. After the game, he was eating burgers with the other boys and there was where the issue started. My husband and the other adults were on another table so they didn't really hear what happened at first.\n\nThey kids were tallking about girls and the birthday boy \"explained\" that the reason women usually don't play physical sports like football is because if they get hurt and bleed, they can't get pregnant anymore, and that this was a medical condition called menstruation. My son corrected him and explained what mestruation was and how periods work. The issue is that the boy then went crying to his father saying my son made him feel uncomfortable and ruined his birthday. None of the other kids felt offended, it was just him. \n\nMy husband thinks that even though there is absolutely nothing wrong in my son having knowledge about feminine issues, I should tell him to be more discrete with that information when talking to another boys his age. I don't think he did anything wrong. I would even said he did a good service to those kids, teaching them.

They were all hanging out and so my husband and I went into the living room to watch a movie. \n\nIt was a really bad/stupid syfy movie about an STD that turns people into super horny zombies. \n\nWe were laughing at how dumb it was. \n\nAt one point there is a dirty/used tampon and the zombie starts chewing on it. \n\nWe were laughing and gagging and joking about how gross it was. \n\nHer friend comes walking in and lectures us on how periods were a beautiful things, and we were being problematic by laughing and saying it was gross. \n\nPoint of it is, we now roll our eyes every time she comes up, we avoid her, he laugh about how obnoxious she was. \n\nI wouldn't say he needs to be discreet about it, but he needs to understand there is a time and place.", "Definitively NTA: Thank you for raising a boy that will understand instead of wrongly assuming based on bad information. You are doing a great service to him.", "NTA. Maybe if your son had brought up periods, then I would say you should probably have a talk with him about how that's not something he should bring up for no reason and some other kids his age haven't learned about this from their parents yet... but explaining the correct information on it when another kid has brought up bad info he probably pieced together himself is a good thing for everyone involved.", "NTA, your husband is saying that you should tell your son to stop checking misinformation getting spread around. That's really what this comes down to. More discreet is code for quiet.\n\nYour son isn't going up to people at random and luxuring about menstruation, he's correcting misinformation when he hears it. That is a valuable thing to do because he is their peer and they will perhaps listen to him.", "NTA. YOUR CHILD IS DOING A PUBLIC SERVICE!!! Those of us who possess a uterus have to deal with so much misinformation that teaching them young is definitely the way to go. They should talk about it until they feel comfortable because I\u2019m not teaching kids to hide their periods anymore. It\u2019s not shameful. It\u2019s daily life. Also your son sounds adorable. The whole height thing got me chuffed.", "Nta, kuddos for raising a respectable young man. I have literally dated a guy that got mad \" because I couldn't hold it\" . Men need to know about periods and not be disgusted or ignorant about them. It's life, it's normal and so many relationship issues can be avoided if mom's and dad's spoke to their kids and were more informed.", "NTA\n\nIt's basic biology, but important biology. By correcting what was wildly inaccurate information, your son make sure everyone at his table will go to sleep better educated and, hopefully, will avoid some future \"mistakes\". Also, your son basically went back against quite a sexist idea that women can't do contact sports.", "NTA - more boys should know about menstruation", "The birthday boy was not upset about the content of the conversation. He was upset that he was contradicted and proved wrong. He is butthurt. Your son is NTA.", "NTA\nCongratulations to you (if it was you who taught him) and your son for dispelling some myths and shedding light on what plenty of girls, let alone boys, know little about.\n\nDid the boy that brought up the subject, with ridiculously incorrect information, also get castigated for talking about it?.", "NTA - but also Lmao the fact this is a conflict between your husband and you is weird. I would feel proud if my kid knew that information as there are way too many boys who don\u2019t have that type of information out there. Lmao at the birthday boy being uncomfortable but also he was so wrong and I\u2019m glad he was corrected", "NTA these people are ridiculous, they're perfectly old enough to know basic fact about human biology, these things aren't disgusting or innapropriate.", "NTA. Your son is working hard to cure boys from this horrific medical condition where they're shielded from reality and catch the misogyny.", "I told my son not to believe everything he hears on the school bus and he can always ask for clarification. He rolled his eyes but he actually really paid attention in school and is quite knowledgeable. There is no reason why your son needs to be corrected. You and your son are NTA.", "As long as it's accurate? They're kids they say all sorts of shit it doesn't matter if it's accurate or not. As long as no one is being bullied it's all good.", "It also results in a period being seen as shameful and something to hide. This boy is doing good work all around.", "Exactly", "And? Teenaged boys go many places because there may be cute teenaged girls. Who cares?", "He's probably the type of kid who thinks girls pee/have periods out of the same hole.", "Yep that is just... pathetic.   \nLike... this is a thing that's presumably been happening for... literally forever???\n\nHow do we still not just talk about it like it's normal?   \nI don't get it.", "Reminds me of this [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanl2o/aita_for_laughing_hysterically_after_a_date_kept/). Comic gold.", "They don't?", "On the off chance you're serious... No, they don't. Female humans have three separate openings: the urethra for wee, the vagina for reproduction (period discharge comes out of this one) and the anus for poop.\n\nOn males the wee tube and the reproductive tube (for sperm) both end up in the same opening, but those holes are separate for females.", "NTA. Your son did that boy a favor by 1) providing him with accurate information and 2) teaching him not to talk about shit he doesn't about expecting not to get corrected. A++ public service.", "Feminine issues!?!?! I really hope your husband didn't mean that the way I'm reading it. \n\nWith that aside...\n\nYour son did nothing wrong. The parents of those other boys are the one's at fault - if they were honest with their son in the first place - there would be no issue to begin with. \n\nGirls can't play football because when they get hurt and bleed and cannot have kids and that's called menstruation!?!?! What kind of horse shit is that? Hahahaha", "The issue wasn\u2019t the topic of menstruation. The issue is birthday boy was embarrassed for being so very wrong about periods. He ran off all butt hurt and tried to make your kid out to be the bad guy. You taught him well. Good job! NTA", "The best advice my son got about s3x and female anatomy was from another boy whose father politely explained it to his son, who then explained it to the other boys.  The father was mortified but I was appreciative bc it was accurate and came from someone he was comfortable listening to, another kid.  Lol.  Most important thing is that it\u2019s age appropriate and respectful", "NTA, I wish more men took the initiative in telling other men to be less stupid.", "You\u2019re not an asshole, you\u2019re a HERO!! Hats off to you and your son, I mean it \ud83e\udd29\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your son heard incorrect, sexist information, and corrected it.", "Lol, keep raising your informed, if slightly weird kid your way.\n\nNTA. Kids that age should know about periods, that is some of the wildest bullshit I\u2019ve read.", "NTA.  Nothing wrong about your son talking about menstruation, especially as the other kid started the conversation.   Birthday boy sounds pretty whiney and immature though.", "NTA- son was just stating facts. It reminds of of Kindergarten Cop (age me much?) \u201cBoys have a penis, girls have a vagina.\u201d \nHubby needs to relax.", "NTA. This is stuff they (should\u2019ve but most likely won\u2019t be) learning about in PE or Health. Good on your son for correctly and politely explaining to those boys what periods are and how they work.", "NTA. The boy was literally spreading misinformation and your son corrected him. He did nothing wrong and it is great that he is educated on that topic. \n\nAlso, wait till your son finds out that tall men can be useful for reaching things at the top of shelves. As a 5'4\" man, they are my heroes.", "NTA.  And your husband is dead wrong. What does he want - another generation of \u201cbros\u201d who think they can mansplain about things by talking out of their ass? Your son is a star and basically performed a PSA. And if that birthday boy were so uncomfortable talking about this, he wouldn\u2019t have started the topic himself. He\u2019s just upset that his ego got hurt by being corrected on his birthday. Which, I get that it stings, but maybe that will make him think twice the next time he tries to pass himself off as an expert on any subject.\n\nOP - good on you for raising a star kid. And make your husband read these comments. He needs to know exactly how problematic this whole issue, and his reaction to it, is.  Boys SHOULD be calling their friends out when they spew bullshit. It\u2019s incredibly effective actually, because we still live in societies and times where the boys will dismiss what the girls say because they\u2019re girls - but when it\u2019s your guy friend, maybe it starts to sink in how silly or misogynistic you are being. He for She is super important, and your son implicitly (explicitly?) knows that.", "NAH, in my opinion.   I think your son is a delight! He schooled the kids on periods after the boy said something ridiculous! That's hysterical! You are not T A for thinking he did the world a favor. The other kid is not the T A for saying something factually wrong, or even for feeling uncomfortable. Menstruation is not something typically discussed at meals and plenty of people would feel uncomfortable if they were contradicted in public.  He's a kid. He isn't mature and shouldn't be considered a A H .  Your husband is not T A for wanting your son to be more discrete  about periods.  He is thinking about social concerns and how to teach a child what topics are best left discussed more privately.    \n\nThis could be a wonderful teaching moment if you and your husband talked with him about your disagreement. What one person feels is too much for a meal time conversation, another is fine with or that some times it is OK to correct someone in public and other times it could be left to a private conversation.   You could even talk about ways people might contradict a person who made a mistake and do so in a way that wasn't embarrassing to the other person. \n\nI don't think there is a right or wrong here. Personally, I love it that your son felt confident and was informed enough to talk about period with boys his age.", "NTA, there are way too many of the make species who do not understand periods. I mean I've seen them say that women only bleed one day, that they only have cramps one time or that we can control when we bleed it's really disturbing how little they are taught!!", "And then everybody started slow clapping.  \n\n\nGet a life.", "NTA. being wrong makes everyone uncomfortable \ud83d\ude02 deal with it!", "NTA.  Your son is a hero. More boys need to know how bodies work, the crying boy was probably less embarrassed by period knowledge, than he was by having his 'knowledge' fact checked.", "NTA.\nSounds like the birthday boy was mad cause your son \u201cknew more than him/showed him up on his birthday\u201d \nThey\u2019re 12, definitely old enough to learn about the other sex", "Ikr. He sounds hilarious.", "IMHO, it\u2019s usually best to err on the side of discretion when correcting genuine misinformation/misunderstandings.  Failure to do so can cause embarrassment, which can lead to the corrected person disregarding the new information.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean not correcting the person at all \u2014 just not necessarily calling them out in front of everyone.", "How is it misogynistic, it sounds like some funny old wives tale.", "From the interaction description whether it's about periods or whztever seems irrelevant. The boy just felt humiliated to be corrected during his birthday' that's all.", "This. This is stuff the 12 year old girls learn in that first \u201cbirds and bees\u201d class. Or at least, it was when I was in school back in the dinosaur age. It is time and past for parents and schools to start educating about the reproductive organs and issues of BOTH genders.", "1.) presuming that girls can't play sports without risking their ability to have children\n\n2.) equating menstruation with an injury\n\n3.) imagine if he said this to a freaked out 12 year old girl who just got her first period and now she thinks she can't ever have children\n\n4.) boys treating menstruation as basically a scary story at a party is part of the culture that produces men who refuse to go get tampons for their girlfriends/wives/daughters because", "And that they can hold their period blood in until they get to a toilet, just like you have to hold your pee.", "I had a friend in college who didn't know this. As soon as I told him he had his girlfriend go to his room with him and prove it", "  I have to remind myself that are literally millions of kind people in the world.\n\nWhat a wonderful kid.", ">I should tell him to be more discrete with that information \n\nIt's not like your son was the one bringing up the topic of women bleeding as a subject of conversation. He *was* discreet. Correcting the other kid was perfectly appropriate, and therefore withing the bounds of discretion.", "Probably best to also explain that some periods are actually exclamation points.", "NTA. If facts make the kid that uncomfortable, he's in for a bad life.", "NTA.\n\nIt's scary the amount of misinformation that boys have about girls.  \"If they menstruate it means they're infertile\"?  Wow.  Those boys could have ended up having lots of unprotected sex with girls because, \"Hey, she admitted she menstruated so I can't get her pregnant.\"", "NTA and the birthday boy wasn't uncomfortable with the topic of conversation. He was mad because he got called out and corrected on his wrong information. He was embarrassed because he thought he actually knew what he was talking about but turns out, he didn't \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, frankly people not correcting others when they are taking absolute BS about anatomy, especially female anatomy, is why there are grown women who think they pee from their vagina. \nSpread the accurate word!", "Your kid sounds cool. I love his reasoning for wanting to go out\ud83d\ude02", "NTA, thanks for teaching this to your son and good for him to correct those boys. Why should he be discreet about this?", "NTA at all.\n\nYou are doing a fantastic job with your son. I hope he continues to deliver factual information to his friends rather than let them wallow in their own ignorance.", "NTA. Your son made the best score of the game and he has a crazy shiny spine to boot.", "NTA. Your son did a service to society.", "NTA.  Besides, take the long view: imagine when he said that in front of a girl.  Even if she's strong and well-informed and it doesn't embarrass her, the scathing look she gives him will haunt him on his fucking *deathbed*.  Insecure guys act like being corrected by girls is torture, he should be grateful. \ud83e\udd23", "NTA but be prepared for other parents to disagree. \n\nMy daughter understood the concept of childbirth in PreK. The teacher kept her separated at playtime along with one other child, as they both liked to \u201cbirth\u201d babies. Btw the other child was the daughter of my obgyn.", "Oh my god, parents like that are reasons why boys don't understand periods, who then grow up into men who don't understand periods and are just plain awful. Boys need to understand how our bodies work, just like we need to understand theirs, and this boy was way wrong. Good on your son for correcting him. Too many times, women are shamed or treated poorly for their periods because of misinformation like this. You are raising a wonderful boy who will be a great man. NTA but hubby and the other boy's dad are", "NTA. \nWhat a stupid argument. The kid brought it up and your son corrected him. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s just out there interrupting kids on the playground to explain periods. \ud83d\ude44 Tell your husband to get a grip.", "NTA. Please, let him tell them all because the shit I have heard about my own body over the years is mindblowing. The boys need to know that, no, we can in fact not just \"hold it in until tomorrow\"", "Birthday boy was the one who started the conversation, so how exactly was he made \"uncomfortable\" by someone else contributing to the confessional topic of his choice?\n\nOh RIGHT, his ignorance was exposed and rather than learn valuable information he retaliated by playing tattletale. And if my 12 year old boy was spouting off such painfully misogynistic tripe at that age I'd a) send a formal thank you to you and your son and b) a formal apology and a promise to do better to all the women he's spoken to since he started dropping such nuggets of  \"wisdom\". Honestly! A 12 year old boy who isn't aware of the existence of women's sports... how did they even look you in the eye long enough to complain on his behalf??\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nAnd your husband should have advocated for your son at the party. It's shameful at that age that the bitlrthdya boy didn't know how this works. His grown ups should be ashamed.", "NTA. As long as the info is accurate, there are waaaay too many boys and men who don't know the first thing about how women's bodies work.", "op=NTA  And neither was your son.  \n\nThe birthday boy mis-explained female biology and your son corrected it.  Birthday boy wasn't uncomfortable about the topic(as he brought it up) he was UPSET that he was corrected, shown to be WRONG.  And birthday boy, clearly didn't like that.\n\nBirthday boy will be the MAN \"mansplaining\" periods and biology to women he meets. He'll wonder why women have period accidents or have to \"go to the bathroom right away\" because all they have to do is \"hold it\" dontcha know.  \n\nAnd he was passing on this ignorance to several other boys who without correction could have believed him.\n\nSo tell Hubby(& upset father?) that maybe if birthday boy had been better educated, your son wouldn't have had to say anything. \n\nPS you may want to check that your husband has properly educated your two step-sons.", "NTA you and your kid are frickin heroes", "This is hilarious.

A lot of guys( not all but a good number) I know don\u2019t get why trying \u201c to normalize talking about period \u201cis a thing.

And make me wonder If it\u2019s possible to get to a place where periods are just treated as a healthy natural part of life and not taboo.
