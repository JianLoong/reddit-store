The other day, he took my son (12M) with them to the birthday of a friend of his kids. They were just going to be outside for a few hours and play (american) football. My son has no interest in playing football but he says he likes being in places where there are a lot of tall boys because he thinks being short is funny. So, when my husband told him a lot of the boys in the party were going to be tall, he wanted to go but he didn't play football with them, just watch from outside. After the game, he was eating burgers with the other boys and there was where the issue started. My husband and the other adults were on another table so they didn't really hear what happened at first.\n\nThey kids were tallking about girls and the birthday boy \"explained\" that the reason women usually don't play physical sports like football is because if they get hurt and bleed, they can't get pregnant anymore, and that this was a medical condition called menstruation. My son corrected him and explained what mestruation was and how periods work. The issue is that the boy then went crying to his father saying my son made him feel uncomfortable and ruined his birthday. None of the other kids felt offended, it was just him. \n\nMy husband thinks that even though there is absolutely nothing wrong in my son having knowledge about feminine issues, I should tell him to be more discrete with that information when talking to another boys his age. I don't think he did anything wrong. I would even said he did a good service to those kids, teaching them. I usually never fight with my husband so the fact that we are now having an interpersonal conflict about this makes me doubt if maybe I am a little in the wrong.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1670865531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk542p/aita_for_allowing_my_son_to_lecture_other_kids/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's a kid who was probably not raised with the same knowledge your son was, and was reacting as kids do when they're faced with something that makes them uncomfortable. He needs to learn, and hopefully he will, in due time. \n\nHubby isn't an asshole either. I wouldn't call him a saint, but there is a rhetoric (especially among men) that period talk is something to be ashamed of or made to be embarrassed by. We all have to unlearn that at one point or another. Asshole is a little strong. Maybe \"misinformed\" or \"ignorant\" could be a better word.

This tells me that it's not an issue with your son and more of an issue with how the other kid's parents talk about women's bodies. My reaction would be to ask why the kid was uncomfortable about normal functioning of 50% of the world's population. Let the other parents justify out loud why their family is squeamish about this, my guess is that they don't have a reason that is acceptable to say out loud. No apologies necessary from your end.", "NTA I'm glad he has the knowledge. The other boy had no issue when shooting his mouth with wrong info and looks like he went crying out of spite.
