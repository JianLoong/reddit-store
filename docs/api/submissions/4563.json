My son has no interest in playing football but he says he likes being in places where there are a lot of tall boys because he thinks being short is funny. So, when my husband told him a lot of the boys in the party were going to be tall, he wanted to go but he didn't play football with them, just watch from outside. After the game, he was eating burgers with the other boys and there was where the issue started. My husband and the other adults were on another table so they didn't really hear what happened at first.\n\nThey kids were tallking about girls and the birthday boy \"explained\" that the reason women usually don't play physical sports like football is because if they get hurt and bleed, they can't get pregnant anymore, and that this was a medical condition called menstruation. My son corrected him and explained what mestruation was and how periods work. The issue is that the boy then went crying to his father saying my son made him feel uncomfortable and ruined his birthday. None of the other kids felt offended, it was just him. \n\nMy husband thinks that even though there is absolutely nothing wrong in my son having knowledge about feminine issues, I should tell him to be more discrete with that information when talking to another boys his age. I don't think he did anything wrong. I would even said he did a good service to those kids, teaching them.

There is a good chance that this will now be joked about when his party is brought up. \n\nI also feel like this post is more of a humble brag. \n\nYeah, this stuff needs to be normalized and taught, but there are better ways to go about it than making the dudes birthday about period education. \n\nLet me give you an example, my step daughter(26) has a friend (28f). One day we had made a birthday dinner for her and her friends. They were all hanging out and so my husband and I went into the living room to watch a movie. \n\nIt was a really bad/stupid syfy movie about an STD that turns people into super horny zombies. \n\nWe were laughing at how dumb it was. \n\nAt one point there is a dirty/used tampon and the zombie starts chewing on it. \n\nWe were laughing and gagging and joking about how gross it was. \n\nHer friend comes walking in and lectures us on how periods were a beautiful things, and we were being problematic by laughing and saying it was gross. \n\nPoint of it is, we now roll our eyes every time she comes up, we avoid her, he laugh about how obnoxious she was. \n\nI wouldn't say he needs to be discreet about it, but he needs to understand there is a time and place.", "Definitively NTA: Thank you for raising a boy that will understand instead of wrongly assuming based on bad information.

And make your husband read these comments. He needs to know exactly how problematic this whole issue, and his reaction to it, is.  Boys SHOULD be calling their friends out when they spew bullshit.

He schooled the kids on periods after the boy said something ridiculous! That's hysterical! You are not T A for thinking he did the world a favor. The other kid is not the T A for saying something factually wrong, or even for feeling uncomfortable. Menstruation is not something typically discussed at meals and plenty of people would feel uncomfortable if they were contradicted in public.  He's a kid.

You could even talk about ways people might contradict a person who made a mistake and do so in a way that wasn't embarrassing to the other person. \n\nI don't think there is a right or wrong here.

The birthday boy certainly wasn't being discreet. The only thing your son maybe needs to work on is his discretion when it comes to correcting somebody at an event that is supposed to be all about their happiness. Unfortunately, even if that person is indisputably incorrect, you risk them to freaking out over being embarrassed on \"their day,\" and therefore it's self-protective to pick your battles and correct the misinformation on another day, or at least approach the situation more cautiously and with subtlety. This is something I had to learn the hard way as an autistic kid. A lot of people absolutely lose their minds if they've decided a day/event is all about celebrating them, and anyone contradicts them or makes them feel embarrassed in any way.

It\u2019s his birthday he needs to be 200% right. No need to correct him esp about chick stuff -  it\u2019s inappropriate for boys to know what\u2019s real\u201d\n\nLike I can\u2019t.", "NTA. The other kid brought it up and he joined a conversation with accurate information... Why would he need to be \"discreet\" when the other kids were already discussing it?", "Oh that's sadly common.

I can always use a good laugh!\n\nThis reminds me of a boyfriend I had who thought the Salem witch trials were about women getting high in Oregon. He was very sheepish to learn that wasn't what getting stoned in Salem was about.", "NTA YOUR KID IS A FUCKING ANGEL BRO. Anyways nah cause you seem to have raised a FINE boy so far. Your husband is being weird however. It seems he truly has some unresolved issues around I don't wanna say misogyny but it feels like the undertone and I'm honestly a little concerned that he might have an effect on your son long term. In any case your son did GREAT, he should continue to be vocal about this issues and you and your husband need to figure out why he's so upset about it, because it is extremely unreasonable and it feels like a symptom of a problem. Good luck.", "Discrete about what? \nWhen I was younger my mother was discrete. I had to hide used pads in the garbage cause my \"father shouldn't see.\" We have moved so past that now as society is more open about periods because it's a natural thing that happens to 50 percent of the population. \n\nThe boy was probably upset because he was wrong and told his parents instead it was because he was uncomfortable. \n\nYour son did nothing wrong.

NTA, also, why are men?", "Youre doing such a fantastic job teaching your son actual facts about it. Wish more would. I'm just curious where these other kids are getting their facts from or if they are just claiming to know shit they are making up on the spot which alot of kids that age seem to do.", "OP, not only are you NTA, I would like to think that if I had chosen to be a parent, I would have done as great a job as you are doing!  While my mother didn't hide things or duck answering uncomfortable questions, my sister and I (me in particular, being oldest) were made to feel that our periods were not \"proper conversation topics\" in \"mixed company.\"  Granted that was a different time (I'm in my 50s), but brava! Well done you!!", "NTA.\n\nThe other boy was not even uncomfortable, he was just angry your son did correct him in front of everyone. If he was truly uncomfortable he wouldn\u2019t have open the topic to begin with.\n\nOf all the other wrong but not harmful things a kid can say about a topic that one was also harmful and misogynistic.

Now that is not the boy fault but I wonder where he has learned it.", "You would be amaze by what topics a young teens birthday party is the place for.", "With respect, I'm going to disagree here - *the time and place was already chosen by the birthday boy,* who decided to bring up the topic and spread misinformation.   \nThis wasn't about being the PC police and ruining a fun night with a gross-out movie, this was about not promoting blatant misogyny and misinformation,\n\nI get where you are coming from, but don't think it's a comparable situation.", "several kids in my class thought menstruation was something that happened to men, because it had the word \u2018men\u2019 in it ^_^", "Did you ever see the Jimmy Kimmel (I think it was him) bit where they're asking men basic questions about women's sexual organs, and the men are just clueless?  Things like how many fallopian tubes does a woman have, and the man just looks confused.", "No? Oh God, that sounds hilarious!", "I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t! Because by the end of 6th grade, most of the class had started their periods. At least we knew what to expect.", "Don't worry wasn't serious", "NTA - a 12 year old should know how puberty works, even if it\u2019s a vague idea contradicting the \u201cwe fall over and are infertile\u201d.

Your son was saving that poor ignorant birthday boy from sounding like a fool when he was older. It\u2019s a shame that boys parents let him think about women in such an ignorant matter.
