The other day, he took my son (12M) with them to the birthday of a friend of his kids. They were just going to be outside for a few hours and play (american) football. My son has no interest in playing football but he says he likes being in places where there are a lot of tall boys because he thinks being short is funny. So, when my husband told him a lot of the boys in the party were going to be tall, he wanted to go but he didn't play football with them, just watch from outside. After the game, he was eating burgers with the other boys and there was where the issue started. My husband and the other adults were on another table so they didn't really hear what happened at first.\n\nThey kids were tallking about girls and the birthday boy \"explained\" that the reason women usually don't play physical sports like football is because if they get hurt and bleed, they can't get pregnant anymore, and that this was a medical condition called menstruation. My son corrected him and explained what mestruation was and how periods work. The issue is that the boy then went crying to his father saying my son made him feel uncomfortable and ruined his birthday. None of the other kids felt offended, it was just him. \n\nMy husband thinks that even though there is absolutely nothing wrong in my son having knowledge about feminine issues, I should tell him to be more discrete with that information when talking to another boys his age. I don't think he did anything wrong. I would even said he did a good service to those kids, teaching them. I usually never fight with my husband so the fact that we are now having an interpersonal conflict about this makes me doubt if maybe I am a little in the wrong.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1670865531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk542p/aita_for_allowing_my_son_to_lecture_other_kids/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is so much stigma around women's health and because men feel \"uncomfortable\" they don't talk about it. Hence leading to misinformation and the continued cycle of people not feeling comfortable with talking about something that half the population has to deal with! Your son did the right thing", "I mean, I'm a man, but... it seems like most women I know want this sort of talk to be normalized so that it DOESN'T cause this exact scenario, where people are offended or made uncomfortable by conversation regarding a perfectly normal female bodily function.   \n\n\nWithout knowing the tone of what your son said I guess it's hard to say whether he was condescending or whatever, but if that topic makes birthday boy uncomfortable he shouldn't have been talking about it. Sounds like your son accurately and politely corrected him.   \n\n\nNAH, unless your husband is being a jerk about this, or birthday boy's dad was angry.   \nI'm with you, teenage boys should be educated on this more.   \n\n\nEither way you're NTA op.", "NTA.\n\nKudos to you for raising a boy who understands what a period is actually about.

Respect. :)", "NTA and you are a great mom :)", "NTA. The other boy was embarrassed for being wrong but your son was doing a service for all females out there correcting him. Least the other boys won\u2019t be confused later on in life!", "NTA.  Thank you for raising an intelligent son. And the other kid's parents should be ashamed if they're teaching him that bs.  Why should he be more discreet at that age?  12 is pre-teen and it's likely that some of his friends have started their cycles.  \n\nI saw a post a little while back where a boy on a school bus noticed that a girl had started her period on the ride home and he jumped up and gave her his hoodie to put around her waist so she wouldn't be embarrassed and bullied.

They're the issue for sheltering their child and spreading misinformation. Keep being a great Mom that actually teaches her son about periods!", "NTA - If it was ok for the birthday to share incorrect information about periods, then why was it wrong for your son to share the correct information?", "NTA.

This is how boys should be raised.", "Nta", "NTA, Good on you for teaching your son this! Especially in a household with so many boys, it is good to teach them about periods and pregnancy.", "NTA\n\nGood on your son for being enlightened on what the other half of the population deals with. Even better that he taught the other kids a thing or two about their ignorance. The other father is part of the problem and should have told his son that your son was correct and that with getting older comes getting educated. Apparently that father never got that memo- to him it\u2019s better to save face than to learn something (he likely taught his son that nonsense, btw). \n\nYour husband needs to also learn that perpetuating falsehoods is no way to keep peace or make friends. Why be discreet about the truth when people are obnoxious as fuck about ignorance, falsehoods and BS?\n\nDo not allow your husband or that other father set a bad precedent for your son- make sure your son is never ashamed or afraid of telling the truth and calling people out on their BS.", "INFO: did anyone overhear this conversation or is this how your son relayed it to you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Real\n\nWhat are with all the posts today!?!", "NAH. Good on you for teaching your son about feminine issues, that's awesome! I agree he didn't do anything wrong. \n\nHowever I'm not really seeing an asshole here. The crying kid isn't an asshole. He's a kid who was probably not raised with the same knowledge your son was, and was reacting as kids do when they're faced with something that makes them uncomfortable. He needs to learn, and hopefully he will, in due time. \n\nHubby isn't an asshole either. I wouldn't call him a saint, but there is a rhetoric (especially among men) that period talk is something to be ashamed of or made to be embarrassed by. We all have to unlearn that at one point or another. Asshole is a little strong. Maybe \"misinformed\" or \"ignorant\" could be a better word. Luckily, you're raising an awesome kid who challenges these norms. Maybe your husband can learn alongside him. \n\nTL;DR: you're not in the wrong, your son sounds awesome, your hubby is in the wrong but is not acting with malicious intent, IMO. No assholes.", "NTA.

There's been quite a few today.\n\n12-13 year olds should have learned about periods in school. We learned in maybe 5th grade?

A boy asked why she didn't just get a bandaid if she was bleeding. He had literally no idea what periods actually were or how they worked. \n\nWe had multiple sex ed classes spanning many years at this point. His response ? \"I didn't pay attention during those.\" \n\nWe were around 15 at the time. I can't say anything about this specific story, but this definitely happens.", "That's true. I live in a state with good schools/education, so even the dumb kids aren't that uneducated. I just remember being that age and never met a boy who didn't know what a period was. Although they definitely were ignorant to some stuff about it lol", "Wow. Blows my mind. I guess as a girl, I find it surpising but yeah - I guess some kids really have no idea", "I went to a pretty decent school district and we still had a girl that couldn't read a clock in 8th grade. You'd be amazed how ignorant people can be.", "I know, you're so right. I know I've met my fair share of stupid people too, but I am surprised every damn time."]}
