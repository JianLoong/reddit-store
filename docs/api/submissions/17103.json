Very big \u2018well she was dressed up she must have wanted my attention\u2019 energy\n\nThat is if you\u2019re a male, I\u2019m assuming, if you\u2019re female you really need to get this internalised misogyny out of you. You know go get your nails done, for you.. or something", "> Where is her service charge on shaving her legs, buying lingerie, getting her nails done and the time that she takes to look good for him? Are you kidding me?\n\nWhat the fuck are you talking about lol this is the most bizarre shit", "Ehmmm, juck!\n\nWhen I shave my legs, I do so because I like my legs smooth when wearing a skirt \nWhen I buy lingerie, oh wait, I don't.\n\nWhen I get my nails done... Oh, come on! I've got two kids, who's got one for that?\n\nIf I want to look good, I do so for myself. Not for my husband. That is not something 'expected of me in a relationship'.\n\nThe fifties want there views back!", "I will gladly pay the service fee for lingerie!", "That\u2019s to say, if she does all those things \ud83d\ude02", "Ewww gross.", "Have you considered that sometimes women do those things and it's not to appeal to men?", "OP is undoubtedly an asshole but you\u2019re stealing his shine here\u2026.", "Or paying for any type of birth control too. Females already get charged a pink tax, so this dude is completely out of line. Hope she breaks up with him. YTA", "Kinda get what you are saying, but still. Gross.", "Here\u2019s the thing though. You actually are.", "Dude, you lie and steal from your partner. I\u2019ll bet this isn\u2019t even the worst you\u2019ve done to her. \n\nYou\u2019re one of the worst.

You are a thief and a liar.", "You definitely are. You are stealing money from your partner and dare to ask if you are an AH.

I had a step sister over-charge me for weekly board in a strange city where I knew nobody else I could stay with.  At the end of my stay, she presented me with an itemized account which included lots of incurred costs for the most unreasonable things such as how much coffee and TP I had used.    I had to sign it and we both had a copy.  BTW, she's a CPA.  She literally took a cut lunch to a business meeting at a restaurant.\n\nI thought she was joking.  No.  I've never met anyone so cheap and lonely in my whole life.  At Christmas, I gave her a money order for two slices of bread and a banana she had forgotten to include in the list.

It means, he gets the privilege to see her after shes put all this effort into herself via self care or pampering herself. A privilege, not an automatic right just bc hes a man or her bf. Its a privilege for her allowing him to enjoy seeing her after that. \n\nNot sexist just an additional example listed of things many women discuss feeling [make up and beauty routines] to be a chore as well.", "But most women don't shave their legs for themselves - they do it because our patriarchal society has told us it's gross to have hairy legs. Pre-1920s, shaving your legs wasn't a thing. The men's razor company wanted to make more money, so started an ad campaign saying that women shouldn't have body hair. Maybe now, some women are used to the feeling of smooth legs and like to keep them smooth but don't pretend the entire act of shaving isn't a patriarchal, mysogynistic thing.", "This is such an uncle joke lol", "The reason he didn\u2019t tell her for over a year is because he knew he was wrong. And if you still question his intelligence, he can\u2019t even think of his own,terrible excuse so he\u2019s asking the internet.", "If you're talking about the dressing up comment it's made by a woman.

Can you not see you're promoting the ideas that r/WitchesVsPatriarchy post is fighting against?", "I thought women did all that stuff to look good for themselves and boost their self esteem, not for other people. Getting mixed messages here.", "You are very much misinterpreting what that post is saying.", "Wat", "The fact that this clear joke got downvoted but the serious misogyny up above got over 1k upvotes honestly is ridiculous. Wth guys. I know this is weird but cmon.", "You shouldn't just let the judgment be. You should stop stealing from your partner you asshole.", "that\u2019s called theft, wells fargo.

Wtf is happening lmao", "All right all right.  The guy was doing something stupid and selfish.\n\nBut don't you think your comment here is a little over the top?  He literally said he takes the judgement.  Why are you being so insanely aggressive?", "100%", "transracial", "That user is active on \" witches vs patriarchy\" \nMakes complete sense by her comment", "Yes but he could have normal household chose like doing the dishes,  getting groceries, cleaning, cooking, etc.\n\nStuff they all adults need to, chores that OP and his gf split up between them as well.\n\nOP is clearly very much an asshole even if we completely ignore that he was doing it behind her back without even telling her. Because that point it's just not asshole behavior anymore, it's straight up theft.\n\nImagine my bank quietly taking $10 per month for a new service fee they never never bothered to tell me about. I would demand that money back as well!", "1.3 k by now ... :-(", "Because op is a fecking THIEF and is doubling down on it.", "this is reddit, get over it.", "\ud83d\udc4d", "It's even worse bc he didn't even say he was going to do it, he lied about the cost of the bills and pocket the extra.", "Agreed. The fact the comment assumes every woman must get her nails done, buy lingerie for her man etc is just gross. Some women have natural nails and basic undies and that's ok too.", "And look how many upvotes that comment has now. Yikes.", "I should charge my GF for shaving and showering and deodorant", "I mean, there are people who charge fees for providing girlfriend services too..."]}
