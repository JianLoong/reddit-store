There's also the the term \"dead fish\" which refers to a woman being bad in bed. The term \"smell like fish\" is a common insult that insinuates women have bad hygiene. So, anyway you look at it, your girlfriend has been sexually humiliated in a room full of people...who laughed at her. \n\nFor all these reasons, you done effed up bad. This might actually be the end of your relationship unless you can somehow do damage control. Also, you can expect that she may not want to be anywhere near your friends in the future because of how they reacted.

There are plenty of offensive comments passed off a jokes. And couldn\u2019t agree more that it\u2019s gotta be called it. \n\nThis ain\u2019t one of them", "It\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter whether the comments made the connection.  OP didn\u2019t, which means the comment was not ill-intended.\n\nYou seem to think that impact is all that matters.  It does, but it doesn\u2019t make someone an AH if that impact was unforeseeable to them.", "Exactly q.q jokes that hurt in the end aren't jokes at alll but at least op seems to understand why it was bad", "He said she hasn't spoken to him since, that's basically the writing on the wall.
