You could have just set aside some \u201cnaked\u201d pasta for her. \n\nBut wow. My partner and his kid are picky but what you\u2019re describing would drive me bananas.", "I don\u2019t think I could ever be with someone who is that picky, but you\u2019ve known her eating habits for 5 years. YTA, it is very easy to put pasta aside.", "YTA. Your girlfriend has preferences and you\u2019re aware of them. She is not a child, but a grown woman who is allowed to have preferences even if you think they\u2019re weird or childish. \n\nA lot of people have food sensitivities that include spice and texture. She doesn\u2019t have to be allergic to something to not want to eat it. Acting like her being picky is an issue is ridiculous, it would have only taken one extra step for you to make sure she had something she was comfortable eating.", "YTA who cares what her preferences are they don\u2019t hurt you. It sounds like she grew up poor though.", "INFO:  What's an adult meal?  And how have you defined what is and isn't an adult meal?  Are meals that don't have spice not adult meals?  Is mixing Salmon and mayo childish by default?\n\nWhat are your metrics here?", "YTA - she knows what she does and doesn't like and you ignoring that makes you TA. My partner is a super picky eater due to textures he can't get past. I would never cook a meal for a large group and not be sure he has something he'll like to eat. My family won't have a group meal without considering his preferences. It's just basic courtesy if you like someone even a little bit.\n\nCalling what you made an \"adult\" meal makes you a huge AH. Adult meals are any meal an adult eats. Unless you are dating a minor she is eating adult meals.", "**YTA** and not a gentle one\n\nShe's an adult, therefore any of her food preferences are as much \"adult meals\" as yours. \n\nYou are not more of an arbiter of what is \"adult food\" than she is, you're just more controlling, more insecure (yes, I said what I said; it takes a deeply insecure person to even care what other people prefer to eat, much less to make such a big deal about judging it), and deeply unkind and lacking in empathy. I'm sure that there are things you don't like to eat, but I'm guessing you'd excuse those as legitimate for one reason or another. It's only HER preferences that are \"childish\" because they don't meet your arbitrary standard.\n\nThe worst part is - and I can't believe others haven't commented on this - your massive hypocrisy. She literally can't win. Because not only do you deride her food preferences, but you criticize her for BEING AGREEABLE AND EATING THINGS THAT SHE DOESN'T LIKE. \n\nSo you're telling us that you think she's an AH for having food preferences, but you also think she's an AH for NOT being demanding about them and eating whatever she's given? You've literally got her coming and going. There's no way for her to come out on top here. \n\nYou're a massive AH because it seems like you're looking for every possible way to deride your GF, and not any way at all to be even minimally thoughtful towards her. Do you even like her? Because it certainly doesn't seem like it.", "YTA.\n\nYou knew her preferences but decided that you still \"know better\". She has every right to her preferences, they don\u2018t hurt anyone and you should respect that as a loving and caring partner.", "YTA.

You basically told your girlfriend that she isn\u2019t worth the effort of moving the spoon from the pot to the plate.", "You Are 1000% the Asshole.", "I'm wondering whether she might be autistic, based on your description. At any rate, for your dismissive tone and comments about \"adult food\", YTA", "YTA. She's an adult. One of the best things about being an adult is eating what you want how you want it. Forcing your food preferences on another person is ah behavior", "YTA and anyone telling you otherwise have been lucky not to have any sort of food problems. The example you gave us alone makes YTA. Why couldn't you just take some pasta out the pot before adding the sauce?", "Everything that you say about how/what she eats sounds exactly like someone who grew up lower income and made meals with what they had. Don\u2019t hate, I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s how she grew up but her preferences suggest it. \n\nYTA because you knew she didn\u2019t eat things a certain way and intentionally decided for her one night wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.  \n\nDon\u2019t eat dinner tonight, after all one night isn\u2019t a big deal right?", "Lol\n\nMild YTA\n\n> I\u2019m not cooking two separate meals for like 9 people so I cooked the pasta then just dumped it in the sauce - one night not going to make a difference?\n\n\nSetting aside a portion of the pasta would not have been cooking a seperate meal. Come on dude.\n\nI do think people\u2019s dislikes should be considered - you basically prepared a meal your partner wouldn\u2019t eat. And that\u2019s shitty.

You knew she wasn't going to like it, she ate it anyway.  When you asked her if she liked it (why?  You already knew the answer!) she pointed out that she knew you knew it wasn't something she'd like.\n\n>She\u2019s not that upset with me, but keeps joking we can\u2019t have family over anymore because then I may just forget I\u2019m in a relationship again\n\nHave you apologized yet?\n\nYTA", "Your GF eats adult meals, unless everything she eats needs to be in the shape of an animal or something.  \n\n\nYTA. Dealing with a picky eater is fucking annoying but going contrary to what works for her because you're lazy is not justified.", "YTA. \n\nBeing a picky eater is not enough to get checked as a child. It is however a starting point as an adult. Most adults who undergo an evalution dont have to have multiple signs before getting evaluated.   \n\n\nMoreover, I am more concerned that she will eat things placed on her plate, to her own detrment. If nothing else your GF should seek out therapy. Her inability to stand up for herself may also be why she is being passive-aggressive in her comments.  You either accept her as she is or let her go. 5 years is a long time for you to say screw your preferences and then abuse the fact that you know she will eat what you put on her plate.", "Gonna lean towards YTA. While that is extreme to me, it isn\u2019t to her. You either respect her choices, or you let her make her own meal. You don\u2019t get to \u2018correct\u2019 her food choices like a parent and child. She does not demand you eat the same thing. If you are annoyed with making two meals, then tell her that it is time for her to start making her own. But you took advantage of the waste not mindset, and are annoyed she didn\u2019t praise you for it? That was never going to happen. You are lucky she is taking it with the humor she is already.", "YTA. Do you know what caused this \"picky eating\"? \n\nIt literally would've cost you nothing to not purposefully he an asshole at that point. She's being a good sport about it, but she's not hurting anyone. If you hate the way she eats, just leave. \n\nI really don't see how setting aside a little pasta is \"cooking for 9 people.\"", "eh, very gentle YTA. It kind of sounds like your gf has some food sensory issues, and it would take next to no effort to set aside some plain pasta for her.

Because you're embarrassed by her eating in front of your parents?", "Yta, she didn't ask for a separate meal, she asked for you to not put sauce on her portion of something you were preparing. You knew she wouldn't refuse to eat it, probably because she has experienced food insecurity at some point in her life, so you obligated her to put something in her body she didn't want, it was controlling behavior.", "Yta I get being annoyed because my boyfriend is picky and some of his reactions annoy me.

Maybe she grew up eating only those things so now as an adult it is hard for her to try new things.\n\nThe fact you were making pasta, like literally plain pasta, and couldn\u2019t take the time to just put a little bit aside for her is disgusting. \n\nYou knew she was going to eat it even if she didn\u2019t like it (this could also be a thing she grew up with, many poor family\u2019s drill it into their children to not waste food).

It would have been easy to set aside some plain pasta noodles on a plate before you added the rest to the sauce. Being with someone with those food preferences sounds exhausting though, admittedly.", "INFO: Has your gf ever considered she may be autistic?", "Info has anyone actually said that you did anything wrong? It sounds like you knew that you were making something that she wouldn't like, she didn't complain about it, you went out of your way to ask her if she liked it knowing that she didn't and are now upset because she admitted that she didn't.", "Is she on the ASD spectrum ? \n\nNAH\n\nSeriously,  this would have been a dealbreaker for me, four and a half years ago.  I am not especially snooty about it but I am a fairly good cook & I love food- well prepared,  well seasoned food made with the highest quality ingredients my budget allows,  at home and when dining out . My sympathy for your frustration is pretty deep.\n\nBUT\n\nYou have accepted this for 5 years and it sounds like she's very probably neurodiverent,  so it's probably not just a  quirk but a set of texture and flavor issues that she can't change any more than she could choose not to be lactose intolerant or not to be allergic to nuts.\n\nIf you aren't going to break up over this,  I think you should consider treating it as though it were a set of food intolerances & accommodating it as best you can without giving up your own pleasure in good food.\n\nI am a more adventurous eater than my husband and we deal by making our own food a couple of nights a week and by agreeing that I can indulge my love of restaurants featuring Thai, sushi, curry, etc.,  with my friends and,  when we eat out,  it's at pubs, steakhouses and the amazing little Mexican restaurant near our house.", "Nah.

I do think it would be reasonable if you were cooking for the family for you to either leave some aside for her or for you to say you're going to sauce it for everyone and she's welcome to make a separate meal for herself. You were inconsiderate, but she also has a very specific kind of diet and can take ownership by making her own meals.", "NTA - but I think you guys should probably have a bigger conversation about it. Her little \"jokes\" about you \"forgetting you're in a relationship\" are sending up red flags for me (maybe I'm reading too much into it). I hate when people make comments like that, but it might indicate that you overlooking her preferences for a day because it was no big deal meant more to her than it did to you.", "Gonna be controversial and say NTA. I used to eat like her (though my particular favourite was pasta with gravy and salt) and I always remember my stepmum refusing to make me a separate meal that I would eat and I was like \"you're new here, you don't understand how things work\" but she told me to either way what she made or starve! I grudgingly ate her food and found I actually really liked it and lo and behold I could suddenly eat things I'd convinced myself I couldn't.

Sounds like SHE needs to grow up. What is she, five? That's literally the eating habits of a five year old.\n\nYou should be gently encouraging her to try new things and expand her tastes, because that also sounds like a REALLY unhealthy diet, and if you love her, surely you want her to be around for a long time, rather than dying early from obesity and other health problems that come from eating that much processed food. \n\nIf she's THAT picky, she should be making her own meals.", "NTA. What if one day she has a business lunch, or goes to a conference? Is she going to douse her pasta in ketchup in front of the CEO, or just go straight to the kids\u2019 menu? Eek.", "NTA  \n\nSometimes you just have to choke down a well prepared meal even if you normally  eat like a seven year old.  \n\nDid she have a neglectful childhood, or an overly entitled childhood?

If she wants to eat plastic cheese she can prepare her own meal.   \n\nIs she immature in other ways?", "NAH. You made one meal that doesn't meal her preferred meal styles. She's not mad, but is dropping a few potentially passive-aggressive jokes. Doesn't seem like AH level anything to me. You aren't insisting she eat what you want her to eat all the time, every day. And even in this instance, it's not like she saw what you made, made something else for herself and you then freaked out on her about it.", "YTA but id say she can start cooking for herself if she likes things that bland and odd. To never really be able to cook a meal you like would be shitty.", "YTA- it\u2019s sounds like she has sensory issues with food.", "YTA. There is no such thing as \"adult meals\". Also, why didn't you just separate some pasta before dumping it into the sauce? Not doing so solidified you as an AH.", "YTA! \n\nThis post is giving massive micro-aggression vibes.

I\u2019m assuming the latter because you chose that specific time to make her food differently and you mentioned in the comments your family hates picky eaters. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going with YTA. You have had 5 years of her eating habits not impacting your relationship (by your own admission in your original post) and then chose to do disregard her wants (perhaps needs?) in that particular moment because your family was visiting.", "YTA but I couldn't find anyone else saying for this reason:\nWhy mix it all together in the first place? This is not a casserole. Have the noodles and sauce separate so everyone can suit the balance to their own tastes.", "YTA. You intentionally fixed the food the way you wanted it.

Her habits are similar to those who grew up in poverty...Kraft boxes are the cheapest, so that's what a lot of families get. I ate ketchup with pasta because the alternative was eating it plain or being hungry.

Cook your own food then if you dont like it you baby.", "No, it\u2019s just what\u2019s normal to me I honestly hadn\u2019t even considered it at that point.", "they grew up on takeaway and frozen foods, her parents still live on takeaway.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s neglect, but I don\u2019t nor will I have children.", "I know toddlers who eat curry, and have a better spice tolerance than her.", "For me, this is where the YTA starts to kick in.\n\nLots of people don't like spice.  Spice appreciation isn't an adult thing, or a fussy thing, it's a palate thing.  There's no \"good for\" here, people either like or tolerate it to varying degrees.\n\nSalmon and mayo is a fine combination, especially in salads.  Can be straight mayo or mayo with bonus flavours, it's all good.  Typically salmon and ANYTHING isn't a childish taste because meals for kids tend to not be salmon (on a pure marketing level at the very least.)\n\nBottom line is that you're making judgements on what you consider to be a \"mature\" palate.  That's in the eye of the beholder (ie: you) and doesn't go beyond you.", "Dumping sauce on pasta isn't necessarily high cuisine, dude. Careful how you judge other's tastes. Unless you made the sauce completely from scratch (meaning NO canned ingredients, including tomato sauce) you aren't exactly a Michelin Star Chef. And separating out a serving of pasta BEFORE you dump it in the sauce is not making two meals. It was a deliberate passive-aggressive move. Asking her after if she liked it sounds like \"gotcha\". You don't seem to like this woman. At all.", "Yeah this response puts you into YTA territory. I love food, i eat most things, even foods some people might classify as controversial, and I have a rule to try anything once. I love spice too. Does that make my food choices adult? \n\nI would not choose to eat ketchup on plain pasta but why call it childish? Salmon and mayo is actually not that weird a combo.\n\n\u201cHaving a bit of spice on food would also be good for her\u201d  - actually it really might not. Some people dont like spicy food. Some people dont tolerate/react well to spicy food. And deciding something would be good for her - thats so condescending.", "Who are you to decide what would be good for her??? Is she your child or your partner?", "In what way? If she doesn't enjoy or want it what does it serve?", "It could also be bad for her - quite a lot of people get heartburn, diarrhea and/or other digestive issues after eating spicy food, even if not having other food intolerances. Hopefully you don't wish gastrointestinal distress upon your girlfriend.", "Exactly! My partner even says how good something I cook for my meal prep lunches smell but knows he won't be able to get them down. What he eats is not my concern as long as he's not malnourished. If you like someone it's an easy accommodation. If you love someone it's a no-brainer.", "I was looking for this response! \n\nReading OPs post I honestly forgot we were in AITA because all of this screams food insecurity and potential abuse or neglect. \n\nOP you were absolutely TA in this one. You could have simply left some plain pasta aside. I'm going to strongly suggest that you do some research on food insecurity even if it ends up that this isn't the case with your GF.\n\nNot everyone has the same access to food as children, and as children we all develop \"comfort foods\". That is honestly what this looks like to this outsider. A box of Kraft Mac and cheese is substantially cheaper and is shelf stable....\"plastic\" cheese is often what is available through WIC in the US. \n\nAs someone else said, as long as she isn't malnourished it's not really up to you to judge or control what she eats. If you can't be supportive or understanding then just let her find someone who will be.", "Okay but dude you judge her for having food preferences, but then judge her again for eating things outside of that preference. So at the end of the day you\u2019re judging her for eating, regardless of if she\u2019s enjoying her meal or not. She can\u2019t change her preferences overnight.\n\nYour entire issue is that she doesn\u2019t like the food *you want her to* and you think somehow she could be the asshole?", "So you like her except how she keeps herself alive? 3 times a day she annoys you is hardly liking her.", "He\u2019s very dismissive too. His ways or adult and her ways are childish. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing \u201cchildish\u201d about eating salmon and Mayo.", "Food insecurity usually happens in poor households that may not have enough food. This can cause psychological issues in children that they carry into adulthood. Eating everything on your plate even if you're full or don't like it made me think she may have grown up not knowing when she was going to get food next.", "What, you\u2019re supposed to know your partners preferences after five years? After only 5,000+ meals together!? /s", "There's a lot of overlap with autism and strong food preferences like this.  It's not enough for a diagnosis, but it's enough that it's worth considering as a possibility.", "Being picky and only eating like a child are two different things to me.", "I was wondering this myself because reading her food \"preferences\" reminds me a lot of my autistic cousin. He basically will only eat very processed or very bland foods. He's in his 20's but his diet looks more like a toddlers. They basically cycle through hot dogs, chicken nuggets, and butter noodles every week.", "I'd encourage her to look into it. The food issue is very common with people that are autistic. My son has many of the same issues, so I make his food how he wants because the important thing is to get him to eat. \n\nAt the end of the day, if these are simply preferences, what are they hurting? It would have been no effort to remove her pasta portion before dumping the sauce. You have to figure out if you want to be right or want to be in this relationship.", "I was thinking the same thing. I dated a dude with Asperger's that was the same way. Fucking with his safe foods were one of the few real triggers he had but it would overload him like a motherfer\n\nYta \nOn the chance she doesn't have sensory issues you still know she's a chicken nugget kid. Don't date people you think you need to change", "1. You know your family have a bias so who's side they are on is irrelevant.\n2. If you want to force your parents rules on her, move in with them, if not stop gatekeeping food choices. \n3. You were childish for not setting her food to the side. It isn't hard too do, you just didn't because you had your family around so got all \"nah fuck your boundaries, my mummy is on my side\" \n4. She might as well complain to friends you've shown talking to you about preferences is pointless.\nYTA", "So your family forced you to eat things you didn\u2019t like and now you\u2019re trying to do the same thing to her. You knew she didn\u2019t like it, why even ask?", "You're not an asshole.  She is an adult and can make her own food if she wants something different.  If she is complaining to others, talk to her about it because that's immature.", "Not at all the point, but okay\ud83d\ude04", "Hmmm, picky eater too, huh?", "\ud83d\ude02", "Well, to me, eating all processed foods your entire life is neglect.   Not in the sense that she's at risk of death or anything, but in the sense that her exposure to foods that are not overly processed, salted and sugared,  is minimal and that creates the distaste for normally prepared food.   Food with interesting seasonings and more nutritious ingredients.   \n\nAs to the squealing, to me that is childlike, not childish.   A joy expressed joyfully is great.", "That explains her palate. No one in her home cooked so she doesn't know how to enjoy home cooked meals.", "That\u2019s so true", "My whole family likes pasta and likes sauce, my dad doesn't mix them because people like different amounts. It is so easy to leave them separate.", "I make a damn good sauce from scratch, but if I'm using tomatoes, I use passata as the tomato base. Literally pureed tomatoes and salt in can. This is a staple in Italian households and does not detract from the sauce. \n\nI also undercook the pasta and finish it in the sauce, so that it absorbs into the pasta and sticks to it better. This is also how Italians do it. Cook pasta a hair shy of al dente, sautee it in butter and parmesan for a few seconds, then simmer the sauce and pasta together, adding pasta water (full of starch from the pasta) to round out the sauce. It's not really a high cuisine thing, its just how you make pasta...", ">(meaning NO canned ingredients, including tomato sauce)\n\nEven no canned peeled tomatoes? \ud83e\udd72", "Perfect response. Have a cookie. \ud83c\udf6a", "She eats like once a day\u2026", "Right?! How EXHAUSTING! /s", "She's eating baby food?", "She usually does make her own food. Is it really that outlandish to expect your partner of five years to do one extra step in the cooking process occasionally (separate a portion of pasta for her before adding sauce to the rest) so she can enjoy her meal? I mean, I do that for my roommates of a year now, it\u2019s really nbd.", "It kinda is. You implied that her eating habits would be a problem at work functions and they really wouldn't be.", "I have autism so certain food textures bother me but never really for taste. So only somewhat.", "I finish the pasta in the sauce. It makes the finished product have an entirely different consistency than mixing them after or just putting the sauce on top. Try it out for yourself if you wanna up your pasta game!", "Yup, I use passata in Italian (and for curries). It\u2019s a great tomato base. And I always put pasta water in, it makes it stick better. I\u2019ll try finishing it in the sauce. Simple once you mention it, like not finishing the pasta before putting it into a pasta bake, or, to be honest, how lasagna works.", "Oh, so disliking her only once a day is okay then", "I swear people like you date people like your gf because you enjoy bringing them down."]}
