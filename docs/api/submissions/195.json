This is my second year on the team, my first year I joined having never played the sport before. I am also in the military, this is relevant. \nIt is also relevant that for about 9 months I have hung out of sports climates with both co-captains. A and B.\n\n\nThis current year, because of my experiences on the field, and my athletic fitness, and experiences with military leadership, I was asked by a co-captain, A, to step up and be a bigger leader on the team. (we are going through a rough transition phase) I try not to undermine either co-captain, and just put my input in to them directly or as situations arise. \n\nMy other captain, B, has seemed to get more annoyed by this as time has gone on. \n(Full disclosure, I do not think B is the best leader, they\u2019ve had a couple missteps as captain, Including ones that have required me to step into matches and arguments. I think the team has lost trust in them, and they see themselves as needing to prove themselves to get it back. and i am fully willing to elaborate in the comments) \n \nToday, as practice was winding down, we were set to do a conditioning drill, Our team was split into two groups, with our group being much smaller, and consisting only of the fittest upperclassmen and some unconditioned freshmen. \n\nCaptain B decided that our conditioning should be individual effort, and i told them that i thought we would get more out of it as a team (think hiit workout with sprinting and burpees)\n\n and captain B immediately retorts that conditioning is about individuals pushing themselves as hard as they need to individually go. \n\nI told then that i dont disagree that generally thats what PT is for , But that if were here as a team we should push as a team, and have the upper-classmen motivating the underclassmen (Its worth noting the other group worked as a team) \n\nCaptain B then snaps and says that \u201cWell if captain u/Diispa thinks so then i guess we have to!\u201d We all were taken aback, and all agreed to work as a team until the final sprint then we quietly started the workout, Until captain B quit halfway through. \n\nAITA for pushing them on this? Until this year, Individual effort conditioning was nonexistent. We always worked as a team.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It sounds like whatever leadership position you are in, it is still subordinate to the captain. If you think a superior officer is going to take it well when you dispute his decisions in front of the team, then I find it hard to believe you are actually in the military.  In addition, it is bad for the team to see the leaders quarreling. It raises doubts about who is in charge, if anyone.  When you have differences of opinion with one of the captains, you should bring it up to them privately.   Finally, once you give your ideas, if you are not in charge, learn to take no for an answer.", "I think part of this stems from our last game. Captain B wasn\u2019t playing, and Captain A was bringing me to a few meetings with the ref mid game to ensure safety. (Pretty common in rugby)   B ran on to ask something else of the ref and was pretty much immediately told to leave by the ref as they were not acting captain. It seemed B took that pretty personally. They also later complained to me about not being shouted out for their hard work after the game.  I am just getting the Vibe That B is getting frustrated from the sacrifices required of their role.", "thats a good point. Me pushing B doesn\u2019t get us to that end goal either if it causes an argument and more mistrust.", "I was talking to them one on one as we walked over to begin the drill, Those around us only heard once they raised their voice to say the last bit.  But i agree, It was probably best of me to leave it after the input, However we are close friends off the pitch, I wasnt viewing the relationship as entirely leader/subordinate, They are my friend and I wanted to explain why i disagreed.", "Your post has been removed. \n\n#Do not repost this without contacting the mods for approval, including edited versions.
