Since I was a kid, I broke my a** to \nsuccess in life, I graduated from University, have a good job, had a lot of side-bussiness and I could buy my own house.\nOn the other hand, my Sister did nothing with her life, she dropped high school at 16 and finished it when she was 26, never wanted to work, she always asked my parents for money, never wanted to study something.\n\nThe situation: I have my own house and at the end of 2022, I decided to move (not definitely) with my gf (3 years of relationship) to another State. I have a car so I thought to use this house maybe some weekends to see my family, friends, etc.\n\nA few months ago, my Sister got a job at McDonalds and talked to me asking if I could rent her my house for cheap for 10 months with his boyfriend and then they will leave because both had the plan to move to another country. Like I'm paying a rent in other state and had my house empty I thought it was a good idea to have an extra income. I accepted it and I charged her a very low rental, maybe 30% of the real price because she had a pretty bad job and salary. \n\nThe problem: Few days ago she told me she got pregnant and decided to have the baby with his bf. About the plan of moving to another country, they decided to cancel it and to stay here. \n\nI asked her about her future plans and she said me that they want to stay here in my house because she doesn't have a place to go because she had to quit her job, her boyfriend doesn't have enough money to pay another rent in the city, she doesn't want to move to my parent's house, and didn't want to move to another cheaper area outside the city neither because \"she likes my house and doesn't want to live outside the city\"\n\nI told her that the first plan was that she will be here for 10 months and then leave  because I need to rent my house through Airbnb to get more money to pay my rent in the other state because is very expensive and she actually pay me like 30% of the real price (And I want to expend some weekends in my house too). I asked her to pay me the full price of the rent but she refused because \"She is not rich like me\" and she will pay me \"what they can according to their salaries and no more than the actual 30%\"\n\nThen she said me that I'm an AH for not thinking about her, that I have lot of money than her, that I'm f***ing rich and I dont need the extra money renting the house and she \"deserves\" a place to rise her baby and she won't be leaving my own house.\n\nI told her that if she decided to have a baby, that's not my problem and she should thought about it before getting pregnant and I want her to leave after the 10 months we agreed in the first time. She still have 4 months more until the 10 months are completed and then she must leave, so she has enough time to look for another place.\n\nAITA??", "created_utc": 1696075518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16w53n2/aita_for_ask_my_sister_to_leave_my_own_house/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
