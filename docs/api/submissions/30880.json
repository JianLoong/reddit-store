On that day, I was wearing a baseball cap with the name and logo of my grad school on it.\n\nAfter going through the store and grabbing what we wanted, we got in line to check out. The cashier was a man, maybe in his 40s or 50s - let's call him \"Bill.\" When we got to the front of the line, the three of us checked out separately and I went last. My mom and brother stood a couple of feet away to wait for me while Bill was ringing me up. After some small talk, Bill looked up and noticed my hat. \"\\[grad school's name\\], huh?\" I nodded, and he asked \"you or that guy?\" and nodded over toward my brother. I told him that I was the one in grad school, and he goes back to ringing up my items. After a few seconds, he looks back up and stares at me.\n\nThe conversation then went as follows:\n\n>Bill: \"You know, you're not going to get very far in life if you can't smile at people.\"  \n>  \n>Me: \"I'm sorry?\" (I hadn't done anything that would have been rude or off-putting - at least, not that I'm aware of.)  \n>  \n>Bill, shrugging: \"Ladies don't get paid the big bucks if they can't be nice. Women have to be nice to be successful.\"  \n>  \n>Me, annoyed and deadpan: \"Not in my experience.\"  \n>  \n>Bill: \"Oh really? You sure about that?\"  \n>  \n>Me: \"Yep, pretty sure.\"  \n>  \n>Bill, shaking his head: \"Sorry, you're going to have to smile more often if you want to succeed in life, sweetie, and -\"  \n>  \n>Me, cutting him off: \"Don't call me sweetie.\" (Annoyance has become frustration at this point.)  \n>  \n>Bill, looking surprised: \"Hey, now, I'm just trying to help you.\"  \n>  \n>Me: \"I'm good, thanks.\"  \n>  \n>Bill: \"All I said was that you should smile more often. Come on, smile for me.\"  \n>  \n>Me: \"Again, I'm good, thanks. I'll smile when I feel like it.\"\n\nWhen we got outside, I told my mother and brother what Bill had said. They both laughed at me and said I should have just \"gone with it.\"\n\nEver since then, they have continued to bring up this situation with me and with friends/family, saying things like \"don't tell OP to smile, she'll snap at you\" or \"what about this time, OP - do you feel like smiling now?\" I get more and more annoyed every time they bring it up, and every time I tell them to stop, they tell me to \"lighten up.\" I've told some of my friends and they agree with me, but my family thinks I'm an a\\*\\*hole for not just going along with what Bill said. I don't think I was an a\\*\\*hole for refusing to smile, but I'm wondering if I should have just gone with it.\n\nTL;DR: Someone (40s-50s man) told me (24F) that I needed to smile more often in order to succeed in life, and I refused to smile at him. My family thinks I'm the a\\*\\*hole and that I should have just went along with it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699827662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tvhbp/aita_for_refusing_to_smile_at_someone_who_told_me/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
