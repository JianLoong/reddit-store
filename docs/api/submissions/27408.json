The more reasons to celebrate in life, the better in my opinion.", "YTA. I\n\n\" I\u2019m hurt over my mom just accepting this is how it is.\" - I'm sorry you're hurt because a \\*toddler\\* who has had their entire life upended, is too young to understand why they were taken away from their mother and is being moved into a totally different life is being given positive attention.\n\n\"the get more parents leave than I did for my own children that was either pushed or cut out of my body.\" - this isn't a competition.\n\n\"my husband side of the family agrees and thinks we should host our own party the day of the baby shower to see where everyone loyalty lies.\" - wow, an entire family who wants to tank an adoption celebration.\n\nJust wow.\n\n Is cruelty your point?", "YTA. Toni has had an *incredibly* hard start in life. If sounds like your sister and her husband may not be set up for kids (or if they have kids, don't have toddler-things). A baby shower can include an adoption shower for kids of any age to allow the family to give them presents *for the benefit of the child.* \n\nThis child CLEARLY needs all the benefits he can get!!!!\n\nYou have three kids. Your brother has two. Maybe instead of being upset your *third child* didn't get a babys hower - which is again, to set up for necessities - you should be rallying around this custody battle and help your sister!\n\nThe idea a toddler \"might be confused\" about gifts and cake is the lowest, most pitiful thing I've ever read from an adult. HE IS A CHILD. He will not remember this. This is a celebration of Jess & Greg stepping up to become parents. And for your mom and family to welcome a new grandchild, however he got here.", "YTA. I'm not sure how you wrote all that down without it clicking with you how wrong you are. I'm very sure this poor little boy hasn't replaced you or your children in your mother's affections, she's just trying to welcome the little soul into the family and make him feel like everyone is happy he's here.\n\nI really do feel that it's time to apologise to everyone, try to overcome your resentment of this little child and have some compassion for the very unhappy start he has had. Maybe even start to think about what you could do to ease his transition and contribute to a joyful occasion?", "YTA.\n\nThis is some really mean stuff. You - and your husband's family - are targeting a toddler \\*and your own family\\* with your pettiness. \n\nHow can you not see how wrong that is?", "YTA. Consider it more of a welcome party than a baby shower. It gives everyone in the family a chance to celebrate him. He\u2019s probably a little traumatized and this might be fun and exciting for him. He is probably coming with very few possessions. Let your family celebrate and give him gifts. Don\u2019t be petty.", "I\u2019m guessing nobody threw you a baby shower for your first baby, because that\u2019s the only reason I can think of for you to be so jealous about this. \n\nGod only knows what that poor baby has been through in his short little life, this is probably the most stable and secure family life he\u2019s ever had.

You don't boycott a party for a social orphan.\n\nI always find it interesting how jealous people end up ruining their own lives. You want more attention from your mother and help with your own children? This is not going to get that. If anything, you are going to make people \"pick sides\" and it's gonna be the toddler not the adult throwing a tantrum. \n\nIf you want a party for your children... throw one. If you need help with your kids, ask. But you are going against your own self-interest by being an asshole about Toni.", "YTA\n\nYou are right, it's not a baby shower when we are talking about a 3 year old child removed from a drug addicted parent. It's a sad situation all around and Toni will be affected by this. But to call it a baby shower is silly. So they are a little bit of an ahole for that.\n\nBut you sound jealous and unwelcoming to Toni, making you the ahole. I think the idea of a welcoming party is really nice where Toni gets to meet all his aunts/uncles, cousins, and his (adoptive) grandparents. It will be a nice way to start his life with Jess and Greg on a positive note in contrast to his undoubtedly traumatic life with his mum and his traumatic removal from his bio mom.", "YTA. You clearly don't look at this child as being part of the family, which he is, and you're coming across as jealous of the attention he's getting, and both of those make you the AH.\n\nIt doesn't matter what they call it, having a party to welcome him into the family and give his parents some of the things they need for a 3yo is a lovely idea.\n\nWhy on earth would you have a party at the same time? It's not a competition.", "YTA. What toddler doesn't like a party. You are butting in where you don't belong. Who cares if they call it a shower, an adoption party, or whatever else they want to. They are celebrating a new member to their family, and you don't have to participate- but you are being an asshole when it would be way nicer to congratulate them all.", "A baby-shower-ish party for a new adoptee is very much appropriate, even if they're no longer a baby.  Toddlers require a lot of stuff, and the new parents probably need a little help getting all of it on such a short timeline.  Calling it a welcome party or whatever would probably mean most people bringing toys for the kid; calling it a baby shower means they'll get a stroller, car seat, clothes, etc.  \n\n\nYour reaction to the idea is simply bizarre.   Why are you so upset that this kid is being welcomed by your family?  And do you really expect any decent human beings to show up to your ultra-petty, competing, \"loyalty test\" party?  YTA, and a very damaged person.  Please seek therapy.", "YTA infinity. Who in their decent heart chooses to deny an abused toddler a fun day? A jealous addled witch, that\u2019s who. Go ahead, host your own party, no one of value will show up. Enjoy your self created misery.", "YTA. Stop being jealous that your sister is successful and kind hearted. No one will like you for it and you're being petty.\n\nMaybe calling it a baby shower is silly, and it should be called an adoption party or welcome party. But that's thier call.", "So there is a new child coming into the family, and some of the adults involved would like to have a party to celebrate.\n\nYou, however, don't have a job that gives you as much parental leave as Jess and Greg get.   (Why is this relevant, even?)  This is not their fault, or the child's fault.  \n\nIf Toni's father is not in the picture and his mother is a drug addict who abandoned him, I am not clear why you are saying that 'Toni has had a family this whole time'.  Because... his parents left him?\n\nWhy are you so outright nasty towards a small boy whose life is just beginning to be repaired, and your sister and BIL who are just now taking him custody of him?  How can you look at yourself in the mirror and think, *I am In The Right*?  Try to remember that your own children have two parents to care for them, and until very recently, Toni has had none.  \n\nI'm sorry to see that your husband and his family are encouraging your worst impulses.

Your mom is trying to do something nice and show Toni that they are a part of this family by welcoming them with a party where everyone else can show their love and support.

Most people would see adoption as something just about as important and happy as biological children and would be happy to see a child like Toni have a life with loving parents who want him.

But sometimes, you do. Sometimes people want to get married in a new ceremony that they can afford better now that they\u2019re older. Sometimes people want to celebrate a new home even if it isn\u2019t their first! And sometimes, people want to throw a baby shower for someone who didn\u2019t have the opportunity to have one.

Her husband's family also has zero comprehension. \n\nWill this child remember this party? Hard to say. What they will remember is the love, joy and caring that it represents. The actual same thing that babies and their parents are \"gifted\" at a traditional baby shower. What would be more natural and right?", "Exactly! My daughter turned 3 a few weeks after her brother was born. We had some baby furniture that finally showed up the week after he was born and it showed up in a huge box. We cut some holes in it to make windows and a door. She played in that thing for weeks! We had a hard time getting rid of it because she would freak out about her \u201chouse\u201d if we ever tried to toss it out.", "We genuinely still have bonus kid\u2019s \u201ctheater\u201d he made out of a washing machine box (with help) when he was little. He used it for YEARS and we had to move it with us. At this point we may just hang on to it until *he* has a kid. \ud83d\ude02", "My kids go nuts for boxes and bubble wrap and paper towel rolls. And sticks lol.", "I\u2019m betting that he\u2019s going to remember this one as a day of fun and love even if he doesn\u2019t remember details exactly.", "I just think about years down the round on his birthday/gotcha day looking at pictures from this party and how much love this kid will feel long term. She\u2019s a heartless B for trying to play the he won\u2019t even remember card. E specially as a mother herself", "Asshole on a cellular level - someone so petty, childish, and jealous that they feel the need to throw a competing party in an attempt to drag people away from a three-year-old\u2019s celebration welcoming him to his first real family.\n\nOP, YTAOACL.\n\nHis new family should post pictures of his party around the house to make sure he remembers his great day! The pictures will also act like garlic on a vampire to keep OP away.", "Some of the diaper boxes are made so that once you empty them and break them down it\u2019s a huge coloring sheet", "I got a box that I LOVED at the start of summer vacation when I was about nine and I listed out on my calendar what I was going to do with it every day. It was awesome", "Haha, my grandson is the same way.  Give him a box and he is in love", "My favorite book for a long time when I was little, was Christina Katerina and the Box. I highly recommend it.", "My parents never let us keep cardboard boxes as long as I wanted. As an adult, I could see how hard it would be in such a small house but.... I still secretly hold resentment.", "I got a new vacuum cleaner when my grandson was 3. We turned the box into a \"racecar\" for him. It had a steering wheel and wheels and everything. It was his favorite toy for weeks.", "The stove was purchased in spring. But still too wet for field work. So my husband built a playhouse in the backyard \ud83d\ude0d.\n\nOtherwise, that thing would still be in my living room \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.\nAt this point it has furniture and shelves!", "I still remember the summer my parents got a new appliance in a massive box and my brother & I made a house. Mum even brought us lunch in there!"]}
