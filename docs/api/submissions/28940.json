It was a rare occasion where all of the grandchildren were together. My older sister was visiting from another state for the weekend with her college aged daughter, and we came to an agreement with my late brother\u2019s ex-wife so that his children were with us for a few hours. That\u2019s all to say there are a lot of moving parts to getting this entire family together.\n\nThere have also been several deaths in the family in the last year\u2026 I wanted to get a picture with my mother and the grandchildren while we have the opportunity since it might never happen that we\u2019re all gathered at the same time like this again. However when I went to get the photo and I called for all the grandkids to go sit with grandma, the niece of my older brother\u2019s partner went to sit with my mother as well. I tired to be very gentle and told her, \"not you, sweetie, just the grandchildren\"\u2026 poor thing doesn\u2019t have much going on in her little head and she just stood there like a deer in headlights until I beckoned her to come stand near me instead before letting the children back outside to play.\n\nNext thing I know my brother is asking me what happened because she\u2019s crying to him about it and he was furious with me over this. Instead of trying to understand my reasoning I gave him that I don\u2019t want some random child in what might be the last photo of mom and the kids, they decided to leave. He childishly hasn\u2019t spoken to me in a week, and I\u2019m not wrong to think he\u2019s the one overreacting and being unreasonable about this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: the comment about the girl was my polite way trying to explain she is mentally special needs and nonverbal, from what I know the mother (the sister of my brother's partner) was on a lot of drugs while pregnant and often left her alone on the floor with food in a dog bowl as a baby... now the girl is like this, and this is why she's in the custody of my brother's partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother edit to say my mother is not the most lucid and *she does not know who this little girl is*. The most they do together is sit in silence when the other children are playing, since this little girl is very shy and often won't go out to play. Instead she glues herself to my mother who won't move away from her. They have \"tea parties\" in silence and the girl makes Play-Doh food for my mother who pretends to eat it. As far as I know, based on how the girl looks, I believe my mother thinks her to be the daughter of a woman who used to work for the family when my mother was young and they would be watched together.

I read right past that.", "I didn\u2019t catch it. Whoa.", "Oh dang I completely missed that, but 100% ugh YTA x a million.", "Dude, you're reaching. Totally possible but I don't think it was explicit enough.", "You could ask her if she wanted to \"help\" take a picture", "Ask her to come help you take the rest of the pictures. Give her some job to do, like holding the curtains or getting everyone's attention, or counting down to the picture. She could probably even take a couple of pictures. Make her feel needed instead of rejected. Most kids of an age to have tea parties would be delighted to have an adult need their help.", "As a photographer I\u2019d just ask her to sit on the side and then if I had to edit her out I could. Did it with my cousin\u2019s abusive partner at my nana\u2019s funeral. Had him stand a bit off to the side and then through the magic of photoshop boom he was gone.", "Photoshop is a thing.", "Still very different", "It's not that bizarre of a comparison. Oher was lead to believe he was being adopted - forming a legal, lifelong relationship with a family that has a huge social impact for his future as well. Instead, he was essentially giving them custody which could be severed at any time with no further social or legal obligations. \n\nOne of the reasons Oher's case is unusual is because a conservatorship was formed without a disability to necessitate it.", "I don\u2019t disagree with the way he talked or describing her was incredibly offensive and he\u2019s TA for that.  The question was excluding her from the photo, for that I don\u2019t think he NTA.  He never said his brother adopted the child nor that his mom saw her as a grandchild nor how long she\u2019s been around\n\nIf she had just started being around the family, she should not be in the picture.  If she\u2019s been around the family for years; then yeah she should have been.\n\nIf Ops wanted blood relatives in the pics he should have made that known but also to his sis and brother before they came so all that could be arranged", "I hope OP never sees their nephews and nieces again.", "Like I said, it's one of those things that doesn't really sound racist until you know people who talk like that. It's like a code, of sorts. Most people will read right past it and think nothing of it. Those of us who live in an area full of racists and bigots of all kinds recognize it for what it is. When someone says someone else looks like the help, they almost always mean \"not white.\"", "This is why I could never be a parent. I could never think of something like that off the top of my head. It seems like one needs to be able to have that quality in order to be a good parent.", "We do this with all the new boyfriends.  If things don't work out it's as easy as a simple edit.", "I\u2019m not a photographer, but I can remove a person from a photo.  It\u2019s just easy now.", "So if a sibling adopted a child, they couldn\u2019t be in the pic because they aren\u2019t related by blood??", "According to OP\u2019s comment, the brother\u2019s partner has been in the family for 25 years and the girl for several years. And OP is an ah for telling the kid \u201cnot you, sweetie, just the grandkids\u201d, which is not just excluding the kid from the picture but also from the family. There are so many ways to get the girl out of the picture without making her feel like she isn\u2019t one of them (for example having her help take the picture). \n\nThis was OP\u2019s comment:\n\n>I have two brothers. One is deceased and had 4 children with an ex-wife, she agreed to having the kids present at the birthday party.\n\n>My older brother is in a 25 years relationship with \"Robert\". They did not have or want any children, my brother especially did not want children. However, \"Robert\" won custody over his niece a couple years or so ago and she now resides with him and my brother. She is not related to us.", "Yep. Because exactly how does \u201cthe help\u201d look? Or have a look\u2026\ud83d\ude12", "Ah o.k. If you have actual experience with some of these specific phrases/ dog whistles, O.K. I'm from arguably the most liberal area in the country. I have no experience with, what seems to be to me, subtle southern epithets. Not epithets... underhanded racism?\n\nEDIT: Anyhow, the way OP described the little girl, I thought was funny because I thought it described OP rather than the little girl."]}
