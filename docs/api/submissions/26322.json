I don't believe that her employers showed up at her house, put a pillowcase over her head, stuffed her in the back of a van, and took her into work. I do believe that there was enough pressure put on her to attend that she (perhaps reasonably) felt she couldn't say no. It's not unreasonable to choose staying home and attending a work function to avoid your bosses being angry with you or consequences at work over going on a trip, and if she was under that sort of pressure from her employers, I wouldn't consider it much of a choice anymore.

OP has clarified that a cabinet minister from his country was at the conference, and that his wife was under a lot of pressure to attend. Unfortunately, in adult life we sometimes do things for work even if we'd really rather not, even if we had other plans that we were looking forward to, simply because not doing them has a very negative impact on the future of our career. Depending on the employment laws, she could have been fired for not attending. Going on vacation instead of attending a conference isn't a protected class, in many areas it would be perfectly legal to fire her over missing it. \n\nNot disagreeing that she's TA, I just felt it was unfair for the original commenter to say she chose not to go as if she just woke up and said \"nah, I don't want to get out of bed early today, I'm not going.\" She 100% needs to come to terms of the fact that she missed out on the trip and that is not her husband's fault, but the person I originally replied to seemed to twist it into it being her fault, when it sounds like it was just really unfortunate timing.", "You need therapy.

I've only ever heard of employers actually expecting employees to cancel vacations at the last minute in fields that reimburse employees for lost vacation costs. People at investment banks and corporate law firms often have to cancel vacations, but that's because their employers shell out thousands to reimburse them for their vacation costs.\n\nIf this is a common expectation in academia when it comes to employee vacations, then it's irrelevant that OP's wife happened not to pay for the Singapore vacation herself in this situation. If she had, would she have been reimbursed by her employer? Or would she just be expected to throw presumably several+ thousand dollars in the trash because a speaker decided to come to her college? \n\nNo matter how small a field academia may be, it's pretty ludicrous to expect academics to regularly cancel their time off with no reimbursement lest they lose their entire careers.", "> I mean, there are countries where you can be fired for wearing purple socks on a Tuesday.\n\nYes, but from the rest of the details it's pretty obvious this wasn't in the USA, so those laws don't apply.", "I was going to say it also depends on the country!
