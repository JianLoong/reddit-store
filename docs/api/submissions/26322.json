Imagine if she had her doctorate (she may very well have it) and someone who isn\u2019t family or longtime friend refused to call her doctor when she wants to be called by her title. It is incredibly rude for someone to deny her acknowledgment of her accomplishments and status. This is what she is doing to you. \n\nYou could have worded it better but her family was even calling her out.

I mean do any of you guys like her??  Also, unless her work thing was the whole trip, why couldn\u2019t she go late or leave early?  \n\nThe way she behaved was poor, but ANYONE would be bummed to lose out on an overseas vacation last minute because of work.  And to have your family and partner give zero shits about your situation is kind of sad.", "ESH. Her for the whining, and you for not having her back with her family. You absolutely should tell her to stop bringing up how unfair it is or whatever, but not in front of her family right after her brother told her to shut up. \n\nThe folks voting NTA don't have to pay for your divorce.", "k", "YTA, only because of how you had no problem with people telling her to shut up and also how cold you were about it as well. You obviously didn't have to reschedule, cause you couldn't. Its more just about how you went about her reaction to not being able to go. It sounds like there's more toxicity to your relationship on your end than your admitting.", "YTA\n\nYou knew she felt bad about missing the trip and you decided it would be great to discuss in front of her how much wonderful time she missed.

However I think the husband could have told her since this was so important for her to go there he would book a trip for the two of them to go together.\n\nI can see where she\u2019s upset and sad, but neither had a choice in the decision.  He should sit down with her go over what is the best time for both of them to go to this place for two weeks and start planning buying tickets etc. hopefully that will help her not feel like she\u2019s being left out.", "NAH, but this is potentially an opportunity to improve communication and deepen your relationship. A few questions:\n\nDo you believe your wife is allowed to feel upset for missing an amazing trip, through no fault of your own?\n\nIf you agree that her feelings are valid, and she's not blaming you, do you think you have properly comforted her?\n\nOr did you and your brother get upset at her being upset and react negatively towards her, without acknowledging/validating her feelings at any point?\n\nAgain, it's not your fault she missed the trip. But a little compassion goes a long way. People often rely on their partners for emotional support when they're feeling down. I don't see why this situation would be any different.", "NTA she has a chance to go but she chose to do what was right for her job.

She was over reacting because she was upset at not being able to go and he had such a great time etc. He could\u2019ve handled it a lot better he could\u2019ve said look these are the places we\u2019re going to go when we go on our vacation. I want you to see this so that you can see where you wanna stay what you wanna do and we can start planning this now and getting reservations. But how He just told her to shut up that\u2019s just cruel and a disregard for her feelings. I hope he follows through on booking the vacation and planning it with her.", "I didn't get the impression she was mad at OP, specifically.

Come on that's lame....", "So you think he should have told her family he can\u2019t talk about his trip because she is such a baby? What? He was asked he did not just volunteer about it! If she was a little more mature she would have kept her immature lame complaints to herself. Why else would HER tell her to shut up?", "> and it was mandatory for every faculty member to be there\n\nShe didn't volunteer to stay for work, her job required it of her. \n\nShe still needs to come to terms with missing the trip, but it's unfair to act like she opted out of it and is now guilt tripping her husband.", "I think your words were very disrespectful. She was feeling left out she was sad etc. You should have just said look I\u2019m going to be taking my wife here too and we\u2019re planning this trip and this is some of the things I\u2019m hoping to show her on this trip.

OP knew she felt bad about it and did not make the situation better by pressing on the sore spot. Again, he could tell about the trip without his wife being around.

So I\u2019d also naturally presume that the wife must have also asked off of work for a least a couple of days?\n\nI\u2019m confused on how she went from being allowed to go on the trip to being not allowed to go? Did she have an approved vacation request? Did she submit one? \n\nEnquiring minds want to know! \ud83e\udd14", "Honestly, if she had approved vacation, she could have gotten out of it - regardless of whether it was \"mandatory\" or not. I mean if you end up sick or in the hospital, you don't go. If you paid for a vacation, your don't go.\n\nSometimes, personal time off isn't negotiable. She chose to go.", "Depending on the profession, it's not uncommon for time off requests to be initially approved and then denied if something comes up. In this case I assume the wife asked for the time off, was told it was good to go, and then this conference came up and she was no longer able to take those specific days off.\n\nShe probably could have flown out to meet him, but I'm guessing that his employers were paying for the flights and since she wasn't able to travel with the group she would have to pay for it out of her own pocket. That could be prohibitively expensive depending on their budget.", "You explained this much better than me and also that politician was cabinet minister of my country so It was pretty much non avoidable otherwise other faculty member would have made her job unnecessarily hard.", "Approved time off is sacrosanct where I work. They can request I reschedule but once it is approved it's approved.\n\nMandatory attendance only applies to people who are on duty/in town. If I'm on approved time off you can whistle Dixie all you want, I ain't coming in. \n\nIf it's different here, then sure, obviously everywhere had different rules. I'd like to know when this meeting was and know if separate travel arrangements could have been made to all attend.\n\nBut sometimes, shit happens. Sucks but there it is.", "That shit is illegal in Spain, if you have your vacation approved, it is set in stone and company can't force you to come.", "> Depending on the profession, it's not uncommon for time off requests to be initially approved and then denied if something comes up.

If she said \"well, I already have flights booked and my time off is approved. I will not be in attendance\" there's likely not much they could do. It's just pressure to get you to relinquish your days off to be \"part of the team\".", "Well, I work in higher education and that would never fly in American academia.

I told them I couldn't miss my brother's wedding. Long story short, I ended up having to bribe the school principal in order to go to my brother's wedding.
