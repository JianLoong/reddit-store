Now they are still married but live separately.\n\nHere's where I probably was a asshole or others have made it sounds like I was one...   \n\n\nMy dad is currently visiting the family. He was supposed to stay with few different relatives until after thanksgiving. He have never been to my new place until Wednesday. I gave him a tour of the place. One unique thing about my place is, the garage used to have a small house attached to it. Since the house is five bedrooms and we only need three, we converted the small house into sorta of a full equipped bar with terrace.   \n\n\nI pointed it out to him and say it was a small kitchen for when we have a party or get together. I didn't open the door or anything and just made excuse about needing to find key to open it and tug him away from it.   \n\n\nThings went fine until Friday morning. My wife and I were off that day so we were about to ready to head out for breakfast with our kids and my dad. My dad bust through the door looking like as if he is about to announce he just won a lottery. He went on and on about how impressive the \"kitchen\" bar is. I immediately knew he peeked into the window and saw all the bottles. I immediately felt sick and quietly told him this isn't something I really want to have a conversation about with him. He all suddenly got offended and start to try and say he's not doing anything wrong. I told him to just pretend he never saw it. He was starting to getting worked up, I have to silently reminded him hes' on \"probation\" since my wife and I have always been very cautious about him being at our place and had repeatedly reminded him before he come that he absolutely cannot show up drunk and cannot have a drink at all! He dropped it.   \n\n\nI thought it was all good until we went to my grandparents' yesterday. My dad proceed to get drunk then went onto raging rants about how I was making him feel horrible about himself, uncomfortable, tempting him with all fancy drinks in my bar, etc... I really doesn't want to talk about this, so I just walked away and let him go on and on. Soon people start to ask me questions. I didn't want to talk about it, I brush it off and told them we already had this conversation and he didn't liked the outcome.   \n\n\nIt got so bad that my dad start to come toward me and point at me and scream at me and people were trying to tell me I should had knew that he was going to want to drink and it won;t hurt to let him have a glass or something. I ended up told everybody my dad isn't welcome at my place and left.   \n\n\nNow I'm getting bunch of phone calls and having to explain the whole thing to everybody. Have been getting a lot of mixed respond and opinion.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole?

Your father is a damn adult and that is your house. Absolutely no one in your family can understand your personal trauma cause by your dad. Abuse and neglect come in so many different forms.\n\nYou set a boundary and no one respected it. You aren\u2019t tempting him and are not responsible for his reactions to your house and bar. Or his actions.\n\nI would cut off contact all together and decide how you want to handle family situations. Boundaries are so damn important!\n\nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you that you\u2019re in the wrong here and your dad needs help. His abuse is definitely ongoing.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA. Your father is an alcoholic and the people who said it wouldn\u2019t hurt to let him have a glass are morons who you\u2019re better off without.", "NTA. Your dad is an alcoholic and clearly not in recovery. I'm so sorry. You made the right call by banning him from your home. It absolutely **will** hurt letting an alcoholic have a glass, because by definition alcoholics don't stop at one glass. Please consider attending an Al anon meeting so you can get some in person support from other people who have had this same experience.", "NTA. Tell those that are saying you should help dear old dad off the wagon that they can host him and supply alcohol and deal with the consequences. You have boundaries, dad crossed them and now he\u2019s persona non grata.\n\nThis is a hill worth dying on.", "NTA. it\u2019s absurd that your family is babying him like this. not only is he a FULL GROWN MAN, but he\u2019s also AN ALCOHOLIC. keeping him away from your bar is just common sense. the others don\u2019t actually care about his wellbeing if they\u2019re just encouraging him. i\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re feeling guilty op, you shouldn\u2019t be. this is entirely his doing and his problem. i hope the rest of your family can see that soon.", "Not the Asshole- NO! You are smart! So smart and so strong! Stay strong now. Trust you. Cheers!", "Your father struggled with sobriety in the past, and clearly, he continues to struggle now. It's not easy to overcome addiction, and occasionally people will fall off the bandwagon (and hopefully hop back on). I don't think your dad is a villain for having an addiction issue. Where it crosses the line for me is the way he's handling (or really, not handling) it.\n\nHe KNOWS he's an alcoholic, and he KNOWS it's not \"okay to just have one drink\" because it'd be hard to stop at just one. He wouldn't have even known about the bar if he didn't go poking around. I'd be willing to bet that anyone who's siding with your father either has heard a skewed version of events, or they're afraid of his temper/rage and thinks that giving in will keep the peace. NTA", "NTA. Your father is an alcoholic. It is a disease as much as it is a choice. Your father has proved that he has chosen to continue the same embarrassing behavior that he performed in your formative years. You should have known better than to show an alcoholic that bar. No good could come from showing that to an addict. It was his choice how he behaved afterwards. It is your choice how to respond. Respect your boundaries. You owe him nothing. You owe no one an explanation.", "Oh man. NTA, but your dad sure is one. So sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA, alcoholics cause problems like this all the time, my father was also like this on many occasions, you grew up with it and no doubt like I are damaged by it, now you are older and just don't have to put up with it.", "His behavior at your grandparent\u2019s house is a perfect example of why you don\u2019t want him to drink in your home, around your kids. If anyone has a problem with that, they can offer him a place to stay and see how they like it when he drinks their booze and starts to piss them off. Also, his family really sucks for supplying a raging alcoholic with booze. Who DOES that?! NTA but be careful, he now knows where a great stash of alcohol is.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is a violent alcoholic who blames his condition on other people. You tried to prevent your dad from seeing your home bar because you didn't want to 'tempt' him or for it to be discussed as totally understand there's a lot of hurt in you and the rest of your family because of your dad's alcoholism. He proved that he's still the same ahole by his behaviour to you on this occasion that you describe in your post.\n\nI wouldn't want someone who treats me like this over at my house either.\n\nI'm sorry about your  dad but he's choosing to not get treatment and he's choosing to not get better. I am sorry that is ruining the relationship you can have with him but he is choosing that. This has nothing to do with you.", "NTA having a parent that is an alcoholic is o tough. It sounds like you\u2019re doing a good job protecting yourself and your family by setting boundaries", "NTA, my dad, is also an alcoholic. And he's homeless. I bring him to stay with me when he needs to, but he knows that when he's here, he can't drink. (I also don't drink, so there's no alcohol here anyway.)\n\nIf I were in your situation,  I wouldn't allow him around if he's drinking *at all*, and whether you do allow him around or not, you should install cameras.", "NTA. Put security cameras around your bar in case your dad brakes in. Need to call cop when he does.", "NTA but the story gets kinda oversold with the \u201ceveryone is calling\u201d bit. That said, it\u2019s your house and your rules and he has a drinking problem", "NTA but also not real smart. My man, you have a wife and children. They come first. You knew he was coming over. Why didn\u2019t you move the booze??? Just because you shouldn\u2019t have to doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t. Why didn\u2019t you meet up with him for lunch or just simply dodge him coming over until it was time for him to go home? Not smart. Now he knows you have a nice house with a separate garage apartment and lots of good booze.\n\nMy man - not smart.", "YTA. After what your family has been through it is a perfectly reasonable rule to have in place.\n\nI do have to question if you genuinely thought banning him from your bar was a good long term solution. If you knew he was attracted to your bar and has a compulsive personality coupled with an addiction, it really was a ticking time bomb for the situation to get this bad.\n\nMaybe a good idea to get your dad and the whole family together to figure out a solution for this. Serve him mocktails at the bar? Have someone else host? Etc.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
