{"id": 15425, "submission_id": "12vaemd", "title": "AITA for refusing to sit next to this man?", "selftext": "I (f, 30s) was riding an almost empty train, there were maybe 5 or 6 people in the whole carriage. I sat in a four-seater (two seats on one side, two across) and spread out my stuff, put my jacket on the seat across from me and put my feet on it so that the seat wouldn't get touched by my socks. If it matters: It was early in the morning and I had been wearing these socks for less than an hour. My shoes are also clean as I alternate two pairs daily to let them dry out between uses.\n\nA guy in Innguess his late forties or maybe early fifties entered the train, came straight to me and said \"move your bag\".\n\nI was puzzled since there was plenty of free seats to go around, so I asked if he really wanted this particular seat and he said yes. So I picked up my bag, he plopped down next to me and I proceeded to pack up my laptop, drink, jacket, put on my shoes and moved to a different four-seater. I spread out again.\n\nBefore I could even get my shoes off, the dude was standing in front of me and said \"move your bag\". I asked why. He said that he wanted to sit there. I answered that he had been wanting that certain seat that I vacated for him, so I don't see why he would want to switch seats. He scoffed and explained that it was not about the specific seat but about \"entitled people who think their bags deserve a seat\". I told him that I moved once for him and wouldn't move again. He made a movement as if he wanted to grab my bag and I raised my voice saying \"don't you fucking dare!\". He started lamenting about entitled people again. I told him \"I moved for you. There are hundreds of free seats on this train, sit somewhere else.\"\n\nHe called me an asshole and went back to his seat. Then he called someone on his phone (or acted like it, who knows) and proceeded to loudly complain about \"entitled bitches\".\n\nTo be clear, when a train filles up, I of course gather my stuff and vacate seats around me so that others can sit. But I don't see why I should let some rando boss me around and invade my personal space for no reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am having a good laugh about all the people commenting on me putting very clean socks on my reasonably clean jacket, while of course instead there must be only butts on seats, and as we all know, butts are so much more hygienic than feet!\n\nI seem to have pinpointed that it's considered bad manners in some cultures, maybe in the US where a lot of users are coming from? In my culture it is not considered bad manners, so I will not be taking your advice of \"keep your damn shoes on!!\" to heart :D\n\nMy question was also about refusing to let the sit guy next to me and not across from me, so I am really amused by so many people focusing on that. So, I will be ignoring all shoe-related comments, but of course if your heart so desires, please let it all out!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: OK now people are sliding into my DMs and asking for pictures of my feet.

I am doing it to be more comfortable. Putting my bag next to me is more comfortable than holding it on my knees. On this train, there was no space to put it under the seat. As I pointed out at the end of my post, I gather my stuff back up when a train starts filling up.\n\nWhere I live, it's forbidden to put shoes on the seat because they are dirty from walking on the ground. I have never had anyone (including any official people from the train company who e.g. go around checking the tickets) complain about socks on a jacket. I wouldn't take my shoes off at the end of the day when my socks may be smelly. But at the beginning of the day, I fail to see the problem.", "I think it's time for new / better shoes", "Moving them AFTER the train fills up ensures no one sits next to you until you have no other option. Unless you have someone who deliberately picks you and asks you to move your bag, which is becoming more commonplace now. It's true that it's more comfortable to spread out, but it's also true that most people who do this are hoping other passengers pick someone else to sit next to as well!\n\nI've never heard that rule before. In the UK where I live they can give you a fixed penalty notice for putting your feet on the seat, doesn't matter whether they have shoes on or not, it's the feet that are the problem, and the possible obstruction of other passengers. I'm also extremely well travelled, especially by rail, and I've never seen a train anywhere I've travelled that specifies that feet with no shoes on are fine to put onto seats.\n\nMaybe the guards haven't given you hassle because they've been too busy, I've seen guards ignore all sorts (people on phones in quiet carriages, people sitting in other people's reserved seats, people hanging arms out the windows, people smoking, people fighting, to name just a few). It doesn't mean it isn't against the rules, it just means a guard hasn't been annoyed enough with you yet to give you fine for it.", "Are there any shoes that are as comfortable as no shoes?", ">Moving them AFTER the train fills up ensures no one sits next to you until you have no other option.\n\nI said as the train starts filling up, not after it has already filled up, that's a big difference.\n\nI also doubt that in my whole life, including the 7 years I commuted by train 4 times a week, I have only encountered guards that were too busy to tell me to get my shoes back on.", "[deleted]", "OK, keep your secrets, then!", "NTA.

If he was mad about you taking up space like he claimed, why didn't he ask you to move your jacket so he could sit across? He chose the seat right next to when there were other seats available.\n\n I used to take the bus and i had a few people chose to sit next to me when there were other seats available. Each time it was a man and each time they said something rude when i got up to go somewhere else. It's actually a thing some guys do because they want to sit next to you and probably start up a conversation. Thinking that you have to talk to them.

But I\u2019m also American so shoes are an absolute must in public.", "100%. That's a guy who hates women and blames them for everything wrong in the world.", "People definitely do this in Japan. I see tons of kids (in socks) allowed to stand on seats.", "You're onto something here", "You clothe your females?!", "We're all dudes, dudettes and dudonts.", "Same. If anything, I\u2019d pick and remove them should the need arise. :-)", "As a man I would like to state that I don\u2019t intentionally manspread, but if I do it\u2019s not when someone is sharing a space with me. Please don\u2019t assume we do it as a statement, I try to be conscious of it and still catch myself doing it all the time in spite of not wanting to. I\u2019m 6\u201d2 and 290 lbs with a large frame, if I inadvertently invade your space please inform me so I can rectify the situation!", "In Europe. It is bad form to put shoes (with potentially muddy soles) on the seats (especially if the seats are upholstered).\n\nIt is considered rude and obnoxious.", "I get that you're well meaning and appreciate that, but there are a lot of good reasons women are not inclined to ask men (especially unfamiliar ones) something like that and would prefer to put up with it rather than risk an unpleasant or even dangerous interaction. You are well meaning and would be gracious and kind... not everybody would be. Case in point, the way the man in this very post.\n\nThat you do your best to be conscious of others is enough, but please don't encourage women to speak up if your premise is \"but *I'd* listen\". It's not *generally* safe for women to do that.", "Yes! Zebras unite \ud83e\udd93 My hEDS doesn\u2019t magically heal because the sight of my socks (??) makes someone uncomfortable!!", "I\u2019m literally sitting cross cross right now! But if I\u2019m on a long haul trip it\u2019s gonna be more comfortable to take my shoes off to sit that way and it still ends up with my socks or shoes on the seat. And I\u2019m not gonna apologize for that!", "What transport do you want disabled people to take just so that *you\u2019re* comfortable?\n\nYou\u2019re the one making everything about you here lol.", "Are you really sure that \u201cdisabled people shouldn\u2019t take public transportation if I have to see their socks\u201d is your real opinion?! Is that really, truly how you feel?", "They should film this story and show it every Christmas. Your partner sounds awesome!", "The point was that many disabilities that cause issues like this arent seen by other commuters. You dont know the lives of \u2018most other people\u2019, you\u2019re just assuming they\u2019re able-bodied and not raised right, and your opinion on them needing to \u2018sit like a fucking adult\u2019 is clouded by that opinion. \n\nNot everything is about that random reddit commenter, no, but you\u2019re talking about your own ableistic and graceless opinion regarding something that quite literally is for them. Public transportation is meant for the Public. That includes people with disabilities.", "We got a bigger bed after I actually kicked him out of bed in my sleep. Now we have two dogs and even less space!", "He's a good bloke. He both steps back and steps up when I need him to. We were friends for a while before we got together, so we know each other's body language fairly well, and we already knew our weird habits and dirty secrets and baggage. I reckon I got lucky.", "You're just saying things that don't apply to OP at all and acting like they're relevant to the argument, is all. You're not off topic, but you are wrong.", "Omg don\u2019t get me started on that. My bf is such a sweetheart he refuses to wake me up when I kick him or take up too much space so sometimes I\u2019ll wake up with him on the floor. Even small dogs seem like they take up so much bed space!"]}
