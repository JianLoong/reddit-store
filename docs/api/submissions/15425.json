I sat in a four-seater (two seats on one side, two across) and spread out my stuff, put my jacket on the seat across from me and put my feet on it so that the seat wouldn't get touched by my socks. If it matters: It was early in the morning and I had been wearing these socks for less than an hour. My shoes are also clean as I alternate two pairs daily to let them dry out between uses.\n\nA guy in Innguess his late forties or maybe early fifties entered the train, came straight to me and said \"move your bag\".\n\nI was puzzled since there was plenty of free seats to go around, so I asked if he really wanted this particular seat and he said yes. So I picked up my bag, he plopped down next to me and I proceeded to pack up my laptop, drink, jacket, put on my shoes and moved to a different four-seater. I spread out again.\n\nBefore I could even get my shoes off, the dude was standing in front of me and said \"move your bag\". I asked why. He said that he wanted to sit there. I answered that he had been wanting that certain seat that I vacated for him, so I don't see why he would want to switch seats. He scoffed and explained that it was not about the specific seat but about \"entitled people who think their bags deserve a seat\". I told him that I moved once for him and wouldn't move again. He made a movement as if he wanted to grab my bag and I raised my voice saying \"don't you fucking dare!\". He started lamenting about entitled people again. I told him \"I moved for you. There are hundreds of free seats on this train, sit somewhere else.\"\n\nHe called me an asshole and went back to his seat. Then he called someone on his phone (or acted like it, who knows) and proceeded to loudly complain about \"entitled bitches\".\n\nTo be clear, when a train filles up, I of course gather my stuff and vacate seats around me so that others can sit.

I am doing it to be more comfortable. Putting my bag next to me is more comfortable than holding it on my knees. On this train, there was no space to put it under the seat. As I pointed out at the end of my post, I gather my stuff back up when a train starts filling up.\n\nWhere I live, it's forbidden to put shoes on the seat because they are dirty from walking on the ground. I have never had anyone (including any official people from the train company who e.g. go around checking the tickets) complain about socks on a jacket. I wouldn't take my shoes off at the end of the day when my socks may be smelly. But at the beginning of the day, I fail to see the problem.", "I think it's time for new / better shoes", "Moving them AFTER the train fills up ensures no one sits next to you until you have no other option. Unless you have someone who deliberately picks you and asks you to move your bag, which is becoming more commonplace now. It's true that it's more comfortable to spread out, but it's also true that most people who do this are hoping other passengers pick someone else to sit next to as well!\n\nI've never heard that rule before. In the UK where I live they can give you a fixed penalty notice for putting your feet on the seat, doesn't matter whether they have shoes on or not, it's the feet that are the problem, and the possible obstruction of other passengers. I'm also extremely well travelled, especially by rail, and I've never seen a train anywhere I've travelled that specifies that feet with no shoes on are fine to put onto seats.\n\nMaybe the guards haven't given you hassle because they've been too busy, I've seen guards ignore all sorts (people on phones in quiet carriages, people sitting in other people's reserved seats, people hanging arms out the windows, people smoking, people fighting, to name just a few). It doesn't mean it isn't against the rules, it just means a guard hasn't been annoyed enough with you yet to give you fine for it.", "Are there any shoes that are as comfortable as no shoes?", ">Moving them AFTER the train fills up ensures no one sits next to you until you have no other option.\n\nI said as the train starts filling up, not after it has already filled up, that's a big difference.\n\nI also doubt that in my whole life, including the 7 years I commuted by train 4 times a week, I have only encountered guards that were too busy to tell me to get my shoes back on.", "Apparently not in your opinion \ud83d\ude02", "OK, keep your secrets, then!"]}
