I sat in a four-seater (two seats on one side, two across) and spread out my stuff, put my jacket on the seat across from me and put my feet on it so that the seat wouldn't get touched by my socks. If it matters: It was early in the morning and I had been wearing these socks for less than an hour. My shoes are also clean as I alternate two pairs daily to let them dry out between uses.\n\nA guy in Innguess his late forties or maybe early fifties entered the train, came straight to me and said \"move your bag\".\n\nI was puzzled since there was plenty of free seats to go around, so I asked if he really wanted this particular seat and he said yes. So I picked up my bag, he plopped down next to me and I proceeded to pack up my laptop, drink, jacket, put on my shoes and moved to a different four-seater. I spread out again.\n\nBefore I could even get my shoes off, the dude was standing in front of me and said \"move your bag\". I asked why. He said that he wanted to sit there. I answered that he had been wanting that certain seat that I vacated for him, so I don't see why he would want to switch seats. He scoffed and explained that it was not about the specific seat but about \"entitled people who think their bags deserve a seat\". I told him that I moved once for him and wouldn't move again. He made a movement as if he wanted to grab my bag and I raised my voice saying \"don't you fucking dare!\". He started lamenting about entitled people again. I told him \"I moved for you. There are hundreds of free seats on this train, sit somewhere else.\"\n\nHe called me an asshole and went back to his seat. Then he called someone on his phone (or acted like it, who knows) and proceeded to loudly complain about \"entitled bitches\".\n\nTo be clear, when a train filles up, I of course gather my stuff and vacate seats around me so that others can sit. But I don't see why I should let some rando boss me around and invade my personal space for no reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am having a good laugh about all the people commenting on me putting very clean socks on my reasonably clean jacket, while of course instead there must be only butts on seats, and as we all know, butts are so much more hygienic than feet!\n\nI seem to have pinpointed that it's considered bad manners in some cultures, maybe in the US where a lot of users are coming from? In my culture it is not considered bad manners, so I will not be taking your advice of \"keep your damn shoes on!!\" to heart :D\n\nMy question was also about refusing to let the sit guy next to me and not across from me, so I am really amused by so many people focusing on that.

I am doing it to be more comfortable. Putting my bag next to me is more comfortable than holding it on my knees. On this train, there was no space to put it under the seat. As I pointed out at the end of my post, I gather my stuff back up when a train starts filling up.\n\nWhere I live, it's forbidden to put shoes on the seat because they are dirty from walking on the ground. I have never had anyone (including any official people from the train company who e.g. go around checking the tickets) complain about socks on a jacket. I wouldn't take my shoes off at the end of the day when my socks may be smelly. But at the beginning of the day, I fail to see the problem.", "I think it's time for new / better shoes", "Moving them AFTER the train fills up ensures no one sits next to you until you have no other option. Unless you have someone who deliberately picks you and asks you to move your bag, which is becoming more commonplace now. It's true that it's more comfortable to spread out, but it's also true that most people who do this are hoping other passengers pick someone else to sit next to as well!\n\nI've never heard that rule before. In the UK where I live they can give you a fixed penalty notice for putting your feet on the seat, doesn't matter whether they have shoes on or not, it's the feet that are the problem, and the possible obstruction of other passengers. I'm also extremely well travelled, especially by rail, and I've never seen a train anywhere I've travelled that specifies that feet with no shoes on are fine to put onto seats.\n\nMaybe the guards haven't given you hassle because they've been too busy, I've seen guards ignore all sorts (people on phones in quiet carriages, people sitting in other people's reserved seats, people hanging arms out the windows, people smoking, people fighting, to name just a few). It doesn't mean it isn't against the rules, it just means a guard hasn't been annoyed enough with you yet to give you fine for it.", "Are there any shoes that are as comfortable as no shoes?", ">Moving them AFTER the train fills up ensures no one sits next to you until you have no other option.\n\nI said as the train starts filling up, not after it has already filled up, that's a big difference.\n\nI also doubt that in my whole life, including the 7 years I commuted by train 4 times a week, I have only encountered guards that were too busy to tell me to get my shoes back on.", "Apparently not in your opinion \ud83d\ude02", "OK, keep your secrets, then!", "NTA.

If he was mad about you taking up space like he claimed, why didn't he ask you to move your jacket so he could sit across? He chose the seat right next to when there were other seats available.\n\n I used to take the bus and i had a few people chose to sit next to me when there were other seats available. Each time it was a man and each time they said something rude when i got up to go somewhere else. It's actually a thing some guys do because they want to sit next to you and probably start up a conversation. Thinking that you have to talk to them.

Lab specimens and study subjects and animals are females and males.\n\nPlus, the people who call girls and women \u201cfemales\u201c almost never call boys and men \u201cmales.\u201c\n\n\u201cCan you believe it?  The male in the car behind me was eating a burger and texting while driving.\u201d", "Oooo sick burn bro\ud83d\ude44", "Says the person with no foot issues. I don\u2019t know what all is wrong with my feet (a lot), but sometimes there is no such thing as a comfortable shoe. If I have to, I take my shoe (s) off bc otherwise I won\u2019t be able to literally walk. I think that as OP did it- with clean socks and not touching the seat in a fairly empty car- is perfectly fine. \n\nI\u2019m fully prepared to get downvoted. But ppl acting like what OP is talking about is the same as someone with funky or crusty feet all up in everyone\u2019s grill is ridiculous.", "As someone who also has a bizarre irrational hatred of feet, it simply is not true that no one wants to see them, it is very obvious that an oddly large amount of people love feet for whatever reason.", "Lol how do you feel about sandals\ud83d\ude02", "Dude, she was there alone. Also, it's more comfortable without shoes lol. You definitely will faint while visiting cultures where people usually don't wear shoes.... Stop making it as if she was naked or something.", "Sorry, I can't distill a reason for \"feet on seat nasty\" from what you said.\n\nYou're of course in no way to humor me, I am just baffled. My best guess at this point is that it's a cultural difference that results in a gut reaction, like touching your food with your left hand in some countries.", "I am cracking up, to be honest! Here I am asking about whether I was right to refuse to move my bag for a dude and at least half of the commenters are talking about my feet :D\n\nLike, they were on a completely different seat, the dude never mentioned them (thankfully), never even looked at them, why are fixating on this?!?! Is it an american thing?!", "> \u201cCan you believe it? The male in the car behind me was eating a burger and texting while driving.\u201d\n\nIn that context, I'd simply use dumbass, regardless of gender.", "I think it's because 'woman' has been used in a derogatory way many times, often reducing the person being addressed, like \"woman, don't you talk back to me\" and 'girl' feels condescending. For me there's often a lot of aggression attached and I feel like calling someone 'woman' is insulting in many situations. \n\nI sometimes use female for these reasons. \n\nAnd I love Female of the Species. It's a great song.\n\nAnd there are things that people only use male for too like: male dominated field and such.", "No, there are not.  \n \nBut I wear moccasin style shoes half a size bigger when traveling, so they are almost as comfortable as no shoes.", "I used to be a hater, but Crocs are up there. Especially the fuzzy ones. Alternatively, I\u2019ve also met people who keep light slippers in their bags for when they travel.", "If there's no dress code you have to adhere to but you still need to wear shoes, Converse. I can't wear anything else anymore because it's the closest to not wearing shoes besides those weird ones that look like socks and often have separated toes.", "If I have only worn my shoes for an hour, yeah", "It\u2019s not perfectly fine, it\u2019s disgusting. There are very comfortable slipper-like shoes that you can buy. Don\u2019t subject the public to your feet on the seat they will be sitting on.", "To be fair, my feet are perfectly healthy. But I don't know, wearing shoes is just uncomfortable for me. Like a lot of women find bras uncomfortable. I have zero pain, it just feels off.", "Taking Your shoes off on public transportation is disgusting. What is wrong with you?", "Yes, this is true! I\u2019ll edit.", "Floors are filthy.  Sandals are shoes.  Keep a barrier between your skin & whatever is on those floors", "It\u2019s not feet per se, it\u2019s seeing feet where I\u2019m about to sit. Nasty.", "I don\u2019t care about feet on the ground, I just don\u2019t want them where I sit.", "It\u2019s bad manners to put your feet on the furniture. What you do in the privacy of your own home is not always acceptable in public. Shoes on your feet and feet off the furniture in public please.", "Oh mine would be more profane.\n\nHaving already been rear-ended by such a person.  Who didn\u2019t notice the red stoplight, me in a bright red car at midday fully stopped, or the four other cars in front of me, also stopped.", "My choice would be wan**r \ud83d\ude03", "Hmmm, good idea, maybe I will try that!", "Thank you, I will give them a try!", "LOL that's exactly what I wear day-to-day, and sports shoes for sports. Still uncomfortable after some time. Thank you for taking the time to write out the tip, though!", "Oh, converse are the WORST for foot smell though.", "I really don\u2019t see why seeing someone\u2019s feet in socks is disgusting? How do you cope with seeing people wearing sandals?", "Again they may be comfortable to you, might not be to me. Honestly, what\u2019s the difference between those and clean socks? Unless you have rancid shoes that funk up those socks. \n\nAs I said, I recognize I\u2019m gonna be disagreed with left and right here. I\u2019ve seen plenty of comments who agree with you. It\u2019ll probably be the consensus. \n\nBut I just wanted someone to speak up in solidarity  with OP on this one. Imo, There are ways and times when you can respectfully rest one\u2019s sore feet in public-discreetly.", "I\u2019m 1 of those weird people who are most comfortable sitting cross-legged. I keep a pair of foldable slippers with me. I\u2019d rather sit with no shoes as they can feel weird the way I sit but it\u2019s more polite. Esp if I\u2019m wearing flip-flops. I know no one wants to see me sitting cross legged with my shoes in my lap. Lol", "Funnily enough, for me it just felt off when I was younger. I got older and now they feel \u201coff\u201d and then suddenly hurt. So I know when it\u2019s coming.", "A lot obviously!", "That\u2019s not what you said though, you said no one wants to see your feet. Flip flops show your whole foot so I was just curious how you handle that lol\n\nEdit : just realized you\u2019re not the one who made that comment, but the point still stands lol. Also I\u2019d argue that the sock is a clean barrier? Lol hasn\u2019t touched the ground and yet still covering the foot \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "1. That is a completely different point from \"nobody wants to see your feet\".\n2. The shoes were on the floor. The socks are also one barrier between my feet and the seat, the jacket is a second barrier. There is really, objectively, no hygienic issue here.", "OK, so manners=cultural reason. Thank you for elaborating!", "I don\u2019t have a problem with feet on the ground, I just don\u2019t want strange feet where I\u2019m about to sit. The socks were on the ground and I know what is on the floor of public transportation.", "So buy some slippers that you can carry in with you in your purse and put on when you want to take your shoes off.   \n\n\nPutting your feet up on the seat across from you is not discrete.", "I\u2019ve done the foldable slippers as well sometimes (if I\u2019ve planned for a long trip, say).  I never just put my bare feet anywhere. I also like sitting cross legged so I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s bothering anyone if they\u2019re not seated next to me.\n\nI think a lot of people just hear \u201cfeet\u201d and are immediately squicked out. Which is understandable. I\u2019m sure they do things that would make me grossed out too. \n\nI try to be as polite as possible, but I only have one pair of feet and I\u2019d like to be able to walk on them as long as I possibly can.", "I take my shoes off on lo g plane rides, don't let them get to you", "Sorry, feet smell. Hygienic barriers don\u2019t matter if you have stinky feet. I just don\u2019t want to see your (possibly) stinky feet on the seat.", "Do you...walk around in your stocking feet?\n\nPlus OP put their jacket down between their feet and the seat. Two layers of fabric between clean feet and a seat on public transport, that's cleaner than most things sitting on there.", "If the rest of the car is empty it can be.", "Feet still can be stinky no matter how many barriers are between them.\n\nAnd no. I wear slippers when I am able to get out of bed. I am bedridden with POTS."]}
