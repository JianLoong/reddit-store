She met him when I was 7 and she moved my brothers and I with her when I was 8 to be with him and his daughters. My dad had been dead a couple of years at that point and we left our maternal and paternal families behind. At the time she sat my brothers and I down and told us that she wanted us to be a family and that my dad's family did not want to welcome my now stepdad and his girls into our family and treat the girls like their grandkids. She said that stepdad had told her how the girls had already been rejected by their mom and the only grandparents they knew and that we needed to go to them so they wouldn't be around more rejection via my dad's family. What I didn't know then but do now is my stepdad's kids were planned with his wife, but she could not have them biologically so they used an egg donor. But she ended up not being able to get over the lack of biology and left and her parents didn't consider them grandkids either so all three were gone before the girls were 5. They were like 3 and 4 at the time.\n\nSo my mom moved the four of us 18 hours away from home to set up a new home with stepdad. She left a really good job and friends which was her sacrifice. \n\nMy brothers and I were never okay with this. They were especially resentful of it and there was a lot of fighting between them and our mom over the years, and them and our stepdad. They both chose to move home once they finished high school. They were also very outspoken to mom that the sacrifice she always talked about as being worth it wasn't to them.\n\nMom and my stepdad started to realize in the last year that I wasn't likely to be the one to stay local after high school either. My mom also noticed how snappy I could be with her and my stepdad when it came to my extended family. It's true. Whenever my stepdad would ask me to not talk about my paternal family around his girls, or to hide stuff they sent from the girls, it would piss me off because he was the one who asked for them not to be around. And I get annoyed with my mom for similar reasons because she made the choice.\n\nSo we started therapy. I have opened up about my feelings somewhat over the last few weeks. Then in our last two sessions it came up that mom just wanted us all to enjoy the good that came from our sacrifice and to feel it was truly all worth it. I said it wasn't worth it to me. That the loss of having my extended family around me was not made up by having a stepdad and stepsisters and if anything, it was the reason I had never grown to love them, because having them meant not having the people I actually loved and they weren't worth that, to me. The therapist had me leave the room because my mom was getting angry (last session) and afterward mom and stepdad told me that I was being so unfair and cruel. Mom told me she did her best and all three of us had punished her for trying to be happy.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667129294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhc0cm/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_the_sacrifices_we/", "score": 5830, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They were especially resentful of it and there was a lot of fighting between them and our mom over the years, and them and our stepdad. They both chose to move home once they finished high school.

You were a child and your mother did not put your well-being before hers. She sacrificed you and your siblings for her now husband and his kids. As a step child I don't see why my fathers parents would need to accept my mother's new kids. Sure it would have been nice, but not required. \nDid your step siblings get screwed in all of this as well? Yeah, they did. But the parents are to blame for that, they tried to force something and it backfired. Go back to your home, and let your mom lay in the bed she made.", "Your mother did what was convenient for her without any regard for your mental well-being or your feelings and thoughts. Your mother talks about sacrifice but the biggest sacrifice she mad was the emotional and mental well-being of you and your brothers to be with her new family. Your mother is angry with you because she concocted this fantasy of fairytale happy families through her rose tinted glasses and doesn't want to hear the truth. 100% NTA.", "NTA and I can guarantee you nothing they said in the car came from the therapist. You were almost definitely asked to leave the room so the therapist could tear into your mother without giving you extra ammunition.\n\nHow can I be so sure? No therapist would ask you to leave the room to tell your parents you're being unfair. Both good and terrible therapists would say that to you directly, the terrible ones would just do it badly while the good ones might ask your parents to leave in order to not give them extra ammunition. \n\nSo that means your parents ignored whatever the therapist told them and just continued to dump their expectations and trauma on you. And that's exactly where you should start the next therapy session: \"back in the car after our last session, my mother kept talking about how unfair I am. I don't think that's true, I think it's pretty fair to resent her choices that negatively affect me. She also said I don't want her to be happy, which I feel is emotionally abusive. But we're obviously all here for an impartial and professional opinion, so what do you think?\"", "NTA! Your stepdad and mom should\u2019ve explained to the girls that you and your siblings had extended family and  that your experiences could be different from them regarding that family. You should\u2019ve never been deprived on your extended family if they weren\u2019t a danger to you.", "As parents, it\u2019s never easy hearing from your children the ways you messed up. She can feel mad, upset, sad\u2026 whatever she wants and she has a right to feel that way upon hearing this news after thinking she did her best (whether that\u2019s true or not, only she knows).\n\nBUT. YOU. ARE. *NOT*. RESPONSIBLE. FOR. HER. FEELINGS! You are personally responsible for your own happiness and yours alone. It is not your job or responsibility to make mom, stepdad, or step sisters happy. Trying to make it your responsibility is called people pleasing and is a trauma response (aka fawn). As an adult, you have every right to move away from your mom and move back closer to your family. \n\nNTA. Yes, it hurt for your mom to hear but in the end you told your truth and that\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019re entitled to your feelings the same as everyone else and mom just has to accept that and figure out how to heal the damage she\u2019s done to the relationship.", "What a mess. I\u2019m so sorry your mom and stepdad had such poor judgment. \n\nBeing \"rejected\" by people who weren\u2019t related to them in any way would have had zero impact on those girls if the adults in their lives had framed it that way. Their friends have grandparents. Why couldn\u2019t their step siblings?\n\nThese issues were your stepfather's issues, and he made them everyone\u2019s. Maybe he was bitter over the rejection of his biological children by his ex-wife and her parents, but whatever the reason, he projected his issues onto you and your extended family. Meanwhile your mother chose to prioritize the needs of the new man in her life ahead of nurturing your important relationships and childhood memories. They punished you and your extended family for a decade to protect his kids from a non-issue.\n\nYour mother's best would have been to advocate for and nurture those connections, not attempt to sever them. She could have been happy without this man and his kids. She could have insisted that you spend some holidays with them, with or without her, especially as you got older. She chose the path of least resistance with her new husband over meeting the emotional needs of her own children. \n\nYour anger is valid, and you're NTA for being honest about your feelings. This isn\u2019t a small thing that you can brush under the carpet. You'll be processing the repercussions of her choices for a long time, and as your mother, being made aware of how big a mistake she made, she should finally be helping you, not asking you to \"be nice\". I\u2019m furious for you.", "The kids should come first.  Parents don\u2019t get to be happy if it\u2019s at the expense of their minor children.  Good ones anyway.\n\n\nYes. The kids are punishing her for trying to be happy\u2014-because she did it at their expense.  She made a totally unreasonable demand, then took away her kids entire positive support system.  I can understand new husband not wanting his girls to feel rejected\u2014but the thing is they wouldn\u2019t have if mom and stepdad hadn\u2019t taught them they were being rejected by moms former in-laws.  Under normal circumstances they wouldn\u2019t expect people who aren\u2019t their grandparents or step grandparents to fill those roles.  They set up the perfect storm for op and his subs to hate the stepdad and stepkids.  They did that, no one else.", "NTA.  Your mom made you and your siblings sacrifice your paternal extended family for *HER* happiness.  She never actually took your feelings and wants into account at all.  I'm really sorry about that.

But in reality \u201cwelcome\u2026. into the family\u201d could just mean to family events. If the grandparents  threw a party for their grandchildren the girls may not be invited. Or maybe it means that the grandparents would avoid going there. Would the new partner and the girls be invited to other family events?

But my mother (and frankly a LOT of parents posters talk about on Reddit) felt the need to have a spouse after the death or divorce of their previous spouse and prioritized that over what was best for their children. I\u2019m a married adult and I think I understand what those benefits are (and I\u2019m not just referring to the physical side of things). There\u2019s companionship, another parent to balance the load, and the day to day aspects of life and raising kids that are simply harder to do alone.\n\nBUT, and this is a giant but, the desire to have those things doesn\u2019t and should never excuse a biological parent\u2019s desire to have those things to the detriment of their children. Your mom straight up put her needs in front of what the best situation would be for you guys. Having the family of your deceased parent around, if they stay involved, makes dealing with the loss of them infinitely easier. And your mom compounded losing their physical presence by limiting how much you could talk about them and your dad, prioritizing the feelings of your step siblings over yours and your brothers. There is no way that a child would ever willing choose that sacrifice. My guess is that with your mother\u2019s love divided you also lost out on the benefits of your remaining parent in a multitude of ways based on my reading between the lines. The financial resources in your home changed. How much time she gave to you and your siblings changed. And she went in to that situation knowing that all of that would be the case. Now she\u2019s reaping the consequences. You\u2019re not being unfair. Unfair would be if you had been informed of all of this before they ever got married, had chosen that path forward, and were now throwing your dissatisfaction in her face. But living with the consequences of one\u2019s actions is not unfair. It\u2019s the natural outgrowth of the path she chose. Just because she didn\u2019t take the time before she chose to marry him and move freaking 18 hours away to consider what the long term ramifications of those choices might mean in time does not make the reality she\u2019s facing now less acceptable. She made her bed and now she has to lie in it. That sucks for her. It does.
