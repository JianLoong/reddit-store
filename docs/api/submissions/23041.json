End of story.\n\nAnd it baffles me that there are people here who scold you for not tipping. There is zero reason why a server who gets this confrontational with a customer should be rewarded with a tip at the end.", "NTA. Especially once the server brought up how \u2018they won\u2019t get a \u201cproper\u201d 20% tip\u2019. A tip is never guaranteed and it\u2019s extremely unprofessional the way they went about it. \nPlus it\u2019s not their business what you order unless the menu clearly states you can\u2019t order off the kids menu after a certain age.", "NTA. And for people saying you should tip anyways for shit service, I heard a story where a guy ordered a $500 cognac shot but wanted it served like a rum and coke. Bartendar is appalled by the customers' request and says it's a waste, etc.  Guess who didn't leave a tip. \n\nYou're servicing someone not upselling them or making their decision for them.  Give them what they want. If you are confused by someone's decision, there are ways to ask politely.", "NTA I am not a big eater. When I go out I usually order a salad or something from the ala carte menu. It's rude to comment on a customer's order to try and hustle a bigger tip.", "NTA.\n\nOrder whatever you please. Kids menu is just named that because of the smaller portions, correct? So if you eat less and would rather order from that menu, go ahead. \n\nI have a friend who works like that (several small meals a day), she only orders an appetiser. I had to do the same thing for months due to stomach issues. \n\nIt\u2019s a restaurant. Order whatever you want. People who have opinions on that can mind their business, keep their eyes on their own plates and as the saying goes (roughly translated from where I come from): let the food silence their mouths.", "NTA.

There was no age limit listed.", "The server tried to make up her own rules arround the tip, that is not nice.\n\nEither there are or there aren't restrictions on who can order the kid's menu, and it should be specify.\n\nSome places if you share a plate  they charge a percentage extra and it says printed on the menu.

The waiter should not be commenting on what patrons order if it's not forbidden per the menu or impossible to make or something.\n\nYou should have left a tip. By tipping nothing, you just proved the waiter right that you are stingy. From your comment about 20% tipping I assume you live in the US, where waiters rely on their tips for their income. Even if one waiter was rude, that doesn't mean you should deprive the servers of their income.\n\nAlso, it does seem like a bit of a breach of etiquette for an adult to order off the kids' menu for the purpose of paying less for their meal, even if an age limit isn't stated on the menu (isn't it kind of implied by the label \"kids menu\"?). If you have leftovers, can't you just get a to go box? For me this isn't the main issue, but the fact that you purposely ordered a cheap meal and then refused to tip makes you an AH.", "To summarize:\n\n* Most kids menus give the restaurant tiny to no profit. That's why most kids menus specify an age limit. It's the restaurant's choice what age limit to set, including no age limit.\n* The waitress gambled and tried to bully you into something more expensive, explicitly to increase her tip.\n* Her bullying failed and you left no tip.\n\n**NTA**. Waitress made a bad bet and you called her on it. This will cost the waitress money, but it's fair because she tried to cost you money.\n\nETA: restaurant view\n\nNote: from the restaurant's side, the kids menu worked. She and bf are more likely to return because that works so well for them. Bf orders the regular meal. Regular moderate profits are better for the restaurant than a single larger profit.", "NTA. I eat the same way too. I don\u2019t order off kids menus because I usually just take the extra home (leftovers yo!) but I think tipping culture is ridiculous. You\u2019re supposed to tip based on the quality of your service, you\u2019re not obligated to give a percentage of your bill to someone.  I understand automatic gratuity for large groups but levying one against an adult ordering off of the kids menu is just ridiculous and is a result of what they *perceive* as cheapness for cheapness\u2019 sake. \n\nThe asshole is whoever is operating that restaurant. Too many places rely on tips to supplement low wages.", "NTA. Next time, I'd tell the waiter it's about portion-size not cost.

She fucked around and found out lol. A tip on a kids menu item is still better nothing, which is what she ended up with for being rude.", "My daughter orders starters instead - she also has a small appetite but doesn\u2019t like the children\u2019s menu (we\u2019re in the UK and it tends to be a bit basic).

I am not going to overstuff myself or take home food I might not even eat, just so you can get a bigger tip. Plus, I know from experience not all restraints are good, no matter what there reviews say, so I would have ordered the smaller portion for that reason as well. You are paying to eat there, just because it's smaller doesn't mean you aren't paying for it. What the hell does that asshole want?

I've worked in several restaurants where we had zero issue with adults ordering off the kid's menu since most of the dishes were literally just smaller portions of the normal dishes. The price was usually about half for the kid's dishes, but that's because they were only a half portion. As a former cook and server, I definitely don't think OP is an asshole. I had an ex that often asked to order off the kid's menu for the same reason as OP and most places didn't care.", "Then I suggest they make it an option to order a small medium or large plating instead from the \"adults section\" of the menu card. \n\nIf I know, I can only eat 30% of a plate.

To make it fair for the kid their ticket costs less, while still allowing the cinema or bus company to charge a higher price for adults.\n\nBut in the case of a restaurant the adult is willingly ordering a smaller meal than the normal ones for grownups, thus costing the restaurant less ingredients  to make the dish.\n\nIf you order a child menu you pay less cause you also receive less in return. While a child in the cinema still gets to see the exact same movie, and not just half of it.", "Hm, these are very interesting questions. Allow me to try -\n\nSo with kids vs. adults, there are a few things to consider.\n\n1. Size. Kids are on average smaller, so should theoretically cost less for portion sizes, venues where space is continuous vs. discrete, or based on height. Point kids.\n\n2. Noise. Kids are loud. So for things that require quiet, kids tickets should cost more. E.g. movies, museums, etc. Point adults.\n\n3. Mess. Kids are messy. So things requiring cleaning afterwards should be more expensive for kids. Point adults.\n\nSo based on this, kids movie tickets and bus fare should be more expensive than adults. Subway fare, kids should be cheaper because they're not necessarily paying for a seat, and taking up less space. \n\nThe thing about OP's scenario is, she got less food, so she should've allowed to pay less. The restaurant could have easily solved this by putting an age limit on the menu. But they didn't, so it's really only the waitress that had a problem with it.", "Yea I got that part, but I don\u2019t get how your upbringing results in your treating leftovers like trash.", "[deleted]", "That\u2019s why I try to avoid taking leftovers home whenever I can.

I also don\u2019t drink alcohol, and usually order water. I still leave a decent tip if service was good.", "NTA but I will say some restauraunts don't let adults order off the kids menu because the kids meal is typically cheaper beyond it just being smaller. They actually price it at a lower rate than adult meals. To provide an example because I feel I'm explaining it poorly. An adult meal might be $10 for 2 pounds of food (simple math $5 a lb) but a kids meal of 1 pound of food might be only 3.50 or 4 instead of 5.

I would much prefer a flat rate tipping based on the number of people or number of items and the actual amount of work put into serve our table (times they came to the table to refill, clear plates, obtain extras, etc.)", "If I got lousy service I would leave a quarter for a tip.  It spoke very loudly.  If you stiff a server, they will just think you are a cheapskate.  But if you tip a quarter, that's letting them know they did a lousy job.  Insulting your customer is doing a lousy job.", "I had a server a few years ago I\u2019ll never forget because she was so awful. I was in a large group and it was for a birthday, and she literally yelled at the person\u2019s birthday it was because he ordered three different drinks (non-alcoholic). He wasn\u2019t asking for comp-he was paying for all of them, but she legit yelled at him. \nEven so, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tip less than 10%,  but I didn\u2019t blame the people who didn\u2019t tip at all. It went beyond bad service, it was verbal abuse and she needed to be fired. Couple of them tried to inform staff but I doubt they did anything.", "I think it\u2019s scammy imo. If I do a drive thru I\u2019ll get kids meals sometimes cause they don\u2019t know who I\u2019m buying for ! Especially at culvers, I always get the kids cheeseburger meal cause I can get a cheeseburger, fries, and root beer which I was gonna get anyway, plus a free ice cream scoop for a lot less than the adult meal deal. I never eat my entire adult portion at dinner  like OP so if the kids meal is something I want, idk why I can\u2019t just get that. Often I\u2019ll just get an appetizer or one of their small plates instead cause it\u2019s a better portion for me and it\u2019s cheaper because of that so really they aren\u2019t making extra money off me personally by limiting the kids menu.", "Kids menus are generally loss-leaders to incentivize parents to come in and spend money on the larger higher profit items and booze.", "Depending on the restaurant there are a lot of reasons. Some kids\u2019 menus are a net loss bc it\u2019s just the same meals in a smaller size. Some restaurants buy a much smaller batch of ingredients for kids\u2019 than adults\u2019 (usually the case for swankier places) + selling it to adults would fuck up their projections/ability to actually feed children. Sometimes it\u2019s just pure nonsense.", "Basically saying they don't like OP. Then calling them a whiner.", "Or just have the restaurants pay their employees properly and get rid of tipping all together", "I mean I've always done \"flat rate\" tips everywhere outside of the fanciest places(where I've made an effort to maintain the percentage norm).  If I order one plate and a drink, it really doesn't matter if it cost $9 or $90, your amount of work didn't change.\n\nThat said, I usually just leave a 5 on the table if I had a standard meal(I don't eat much, nor do I go for anything expensive - I'm a $15 soup and half a sandwich guy). If that meal was $10, I leave that 5. If it was $25, I leave that 5. If I ordered multiple things(apps, entree, desserts) I usually leave a 10 on the table. Doesn't matter if it was $25 or $55.  \n\nNow if your service is particularly good or bad? That's what adjusts my tip. Personable? Helpful? Made good suggestions? Made yourself available when you could see we might need something? You're probably getting a little extra. That 5 might become a 10, or 5 + the 3 I got in change, or whatever. \n\nSat there looking bored in a booth while we sat there with empty drinks? Chilled by the register gossiping while we were done eating and clearly waiting to get our bill? Etc... That 10 might become a 5, or less if you're really terrible at your job. I'll almost always at least leave the couple dollars I got in change, even if you were terrible - unless you were really THAT bad. \n\n\nThe idea of tipping based on price never made sense to me when the amount of work is exactly the same. Better service gets a better tip, worse service gets a worse tip.  If I order twice, or whatever... Sure thatll effect it.  But ordering the $20 cake and ice cream vs the $10 pie and ice cream for dessert... Isn't going to change my tip. They're the same thing effort wise for the server.  If I order a $20 meal and you're great, you might get that $10 tip + the dollars I get in change. If I order the $75 meal and you're terrible, you might get the $1.36 I got back in change.", "In other words, I got mine, fuck you. Lovely.", "That's not a \"me\" problem.", "In your case I would have made a normal tip but I would give it to the hostess directly and tell her that the tip was for the people who prepared the meal, not for the person who served the meal."]}
