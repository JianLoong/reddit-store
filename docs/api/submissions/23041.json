And for people saying you should tip anyways for shit service, I heard a story where a guy ordered a $500 cognac shot but wanted it served like a rum and coke. Bartendar is appalled by the customers' request and says it's a waste, etc.  Guess who didn't leave a tip. \n\nYou're servicing someone not upselling them or making their decision for them.  Give them what they want. If you are confused by someone's decision, there are ways to ask politely.", "NTA I am not a big eater. When I go out I usually order a salad or something from the ala carte menu. It's rude to comment on a customer's order to try and hustle a bigger tip.", "NTA.\n\nOrder whatever you please. Kids menu is just named that because of the smaller portions, correct? So if you eat less and would rather order from that menu, go ahead. \n\nI have a friend who works like that (several small meals a day), she only orders an appetiser. I had to do the same thing for months due to stomach issues. \n\nIt\u2019s a restaurant. Order whatever you want. People who have opinions on that can mind their business, keep their eyes on their own plates and as the saying goes (roughly translated from where I come from): let the food silence their mouths.", "NTA.

The waiter should not be commenting on what patrons order if it's not forbidden per the menu or impossible to make or something.\n\nYou should have left a tip. By tipping nothing, you just proved the waiter right that you are stingy. From your comment about 20% tipping I assume you live in the US, where waiters rely on their tips for their income. Even if one waiter was rude, that doesn't mean you should deprive the servers of their income.\n\nAlso, it does seem like a bit of a breach of etiquette for an adult to order off the kids' menu for the purpose of paying less for their meal, even if an age limit isn't stated on the menu (isn't it kind of implied by the label \"kids menu\"?). If you have leftovers, can't you just get a to go box? For me this isn't the main issue, but the fact that you purposely ordered a cheap meal and then refused to tip makes you an AH.", "To summarize:\n\n* Most kids menus give the restaurant tiny to no profit. That's why most kids menus specify an age limit. It's the restaurant's choice what age limit to set, including no age limit.\n* The waitress gambled and tried to bully you into something more expensive, explicitly to increase her tip.\n* Her bullying failed and you left no tip.\n\n**NTA**. Waitress made a bad bet and you called her on it. This will cost the waitress money, but it's fair because she tried to cost you money.\n\nETA: restaurant view\n\nNote: from the restaurant's side, the kids menu worked. She and bf are more likely to return because that works so well for them. Bf orders the regular meal. Regular moderate profits are better for the restaurant than a single larger profit.", "NTA. I eat the same way too. I don\u2019t order off kids menus because I usually just take the extra home (leftovers yo!) but I think tipping culture is ridiculous. You\u2019re supposed to tip based on the quality of your service, you\u2019re not obligated to give a percentage of your bill to someone.  I understand automatic gratuity for large groups but levying one against an adult ordering off of the kids menu is just ridiculous and is a result of what they *perceive* as cheapness for cheapness\u2019 sake. \n\nThe asshole is whoever is operating that restaurant. Too many places rely on tips to supplement low wages.", "NTA. Next time, I'd tell the waiter it's about portion-size not cost.

I am not going to overstuff myself or take home food I might not even eat, just so you can get a bigger tip. Plus, I know from experience not all restraints are good, no matter what there reviews say, so I would have ordered the smaller portion for that reason as well. You are paying to eat there, just because it's smaller doesn't mean you aren't paying for it. What the hell does that asshole want?

I've worked in several restaurants where we had zero issue with adults ordering off the kid's menu since most of the dishes were literally just smaller portions of the normal dishes. The price was usually about half for the kid's dishes, but that's because they were only a half portion. As a former cook and server, I definitely don't think OP is an asshole. I had an ex that often asked to order off the kid's menu for the same reason as OP and most places didn't care.", "Then I suggest they make it an option to order a small medium or large plating instead from the \"adults section\" of the menu card. \n\nIf I know, I can only eat 30% of a plate. Why should I order and pay for a huge plate of food that will just be thrown in the garbage? \nThe pricing on a kids' plate and an adult plate is not small in most places.

To make it fair for the kid their ticket costs less, while still allowing the cinema or bus company to charge a higher price for adults.\n\nBut in the case of a restaurant the adult is willingly ordering a smaller meal than the normal ones for grownups, thus costing the restaurant less ingredients  to make the dish.\n\nIf you order a child menu you pay less cause you also receive less in return. While a child in the cinema still gets to see the exact same movie, and not just half of it.", "Hm, these are very interesting questions. Allow me to try -\n\nSo with kids vs. adults, there are a few things to consider.\n\n1. Size. Kids are on average smaller, so should theoretically cost less for portion sizes, venues where space is continuous vs. discrete, or based on height. Point kids.\n\n2. Noise. Kids are loud. So for things that require quiet, kids tickets should cost more. E.g. movies, museums, etc. Point adults.\n\n3. Mess. Kids are messy. So things requiring cleaning afterwards should be more expensive for kids. Point adults.\n\nSo based on this, kids movie tickets and bus fare should be more expensive than adults. Subway fare, kids should be cheaper because they're not necessarily paying for a seat, and taking up less space. \n\nThe thing about OP's scenario is, she got less food, so she should've allowed to pay less. The restaurant could have easily solved this by putting an age limit on the menu. But they didn't, so it's really only the waitress that had a problem with it.", "Yea I got that part, but I don\u2019t get how your upbringing results in your treating leftovers like trash.", "Yeah people who go out and order a kids meal 'cause they're stomach is so so tiny usually go on to order an expensive dessert \ud83d\ude44 /s", "That\u2019s why I try to avoid taking leftovers home whenever I can. I either order appetizers or kids menu items. I didn\u2019t like any appetizers from this specific place so I ordered kids menu. And I said 90% of the time. I\u2019ll still eat leftovers sometimes but most of the time I\u2019ll avoid it. I just grew accustomed to freshly prepared food on my plate everyday. Which is why when i or anyone else cooks for me, it\u2019s always small portions."]}
