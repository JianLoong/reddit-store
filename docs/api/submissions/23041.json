End of story.\n\nAnd it baffles me that there are people here who scold you for not tipping. There is zero reason why a server who gets this confrontational with a customer should be rewarded with a tip at the end.", "NTA. Especially once the server brought up how \u2018they won\u2019t get a \u201cproper\u201d 20% tip\u2019.

And for people saying you should tip anyways for shit service, I heard a story where a guy ordered a $500 cognac shot but wanted it served like a rum and coke. Bartendar is appalled by the customers' request and says it's a waste, etc.  Guess who didn't leave a tip. \n\nYou're servicing someone not upselling them or making their decision for them.  Give them what they want. If you are confused by someone's decision, there are ways to ask politely.", "NTA I am not a big eater. When I go out I usually order a salad or something from the ala carte menu. It's rude to comment on a customer's order to try and hustle a bigger tip.", "NTA.\n\nOrder whatever you please. Kids menu is just named that because of the smaller portions, correct? So if you eat less and would rather order from that menu, go ahead. \n\nI have a friend who works like that (several small meals a day), she only orders an appetiser. I had to do the same thing for months due to stomach issues. \n\nIt\u2019s a restaurant. Order whatever you want. People who have opinions on that can mind their business, keep their eyes on their own plates and as the saying goes (roughly translated from where I come from): let the food silence their mouths.", "NTA.

The waiter should not be commenting on what patrons order if it's not forbidden per the menu or impossible to make or something.\n\nYou should have left a tip. By tipping nothing, you just proved the waiter right that you are stingy. From your comment about 20% tipping I assume you live in the US, where waiters rely on their tips for their income. Even if one waiter was rude, that doesn't mean you should deprive the servers of their income.\n\nAlso, it does seem like a bit of a breach of etiquette for an adult to order off the kids' menu for the purpose of paying less for their meal, even if an age limit isn't stated on the menu (isn't it kind of implied by the label \"kids menu\"?). If you have leftovers, can't you just get a to go box? For me this isn't the main issue, but the fact that you purposely ordered a cheap meal and then refused to tip makes you an AH.", "To summarize:\n\n* Most kids menus give the restaurant tiny to no profit. That's why most kids menus specify an age limit. It's the restaurant's choice what age limit to set, including no age limit.\n* The waitress gambled and tried to bully you into something more expensive, explicitly to increase her tip.\n* Her bullying failed and you left no tip.\n\n**NTA**. Waitress made a bad bet and you called her on it. This will cost the waitress money, but it's fair because she tried to cost you money.\n\nETA: restaurant view\n\nNote: from the restaurant's side, the kids menu worked. She and bf are more likely to return because that works so well for them. Bf orders the regular meal. Regular moderate profits are better for the restaurant than a single larger profit.", "NTA. I eat the same way too. I don\u2019t order off kids menus because I usually just take the extra home (leftovers yo!) but I think tipping culture is ridiculous. You\u2019re supposed to tip based on the quality of your service, you\u2019re not obligated to give a percentage of your bill to someone.  I understand automatic gratuity for large groups but levying one against an adult ordering off of the kids menu is just ridiculous and is a result of what they *perceive* as cheapness for cheapness\u2019 sake. \n\nThe asshole is whoever is operating that restaurant. Too many places rely on tips to supplement low wages.", "NTA. Next time, I'd tell the waiter it's about portion-size not cost.

I am not going to overstuff myself or take home food I might not even eat, just so you can get a bigger tip. Plus, I know from experience not all restraints are good, no matter what there reviews say, so I would have ordered the smaller portion for that reason as well. You are paying to eat there, just because it's smaller doesn't mean you aren't paying for it. What the hell does that asshole want?

I've worked in several restaurants where we had zero issue with adults ordering off the kid's menu since most of the dishes were literally just smaller portions of the normal dishes. The price was usually about half for the kid's dishes, but that's because they were only a half portion. As a former cook and server, I definitely don't think OP is an asshole.

While a child in the cinema still gets to see the exact same movie, and not just half of it.", "Hm, these are very interesting questions. Allow me to try -\n\nSo with kids vs. adults, there are a few things to consider.\n\n1. Size. Kids are on average smaller, so should theoretically cost less for portion sizes, venues where space is continuous vs. discrete, or based on height. Point kids.\n\n2. Noise. Kids are loud. So for things that require quiet, kids tickets should cost more. E.g. movies, museums, etc. Point adults.\n\n3. Mess. Kids are messy. So things requiring cleaning afterwards should be more expensive for kids. Point adults.\n\nSo based on this, kids movie tickets and bus fare should be more expensive than adults. Subway fare, kids should be cheaper because they're not necessarily paying for a seat, and taking up less space. \n\nThe thing about OP's scenario is, she got less food, so she should've allowed to pay less. The restaurant could have easily solved this by putting an age limit on the menu. But they didn't, so it's really only the waitress that had a problem with it.", "Yea I got that part, but I don\u2019t get how your upbringing results in your treating leftovers like trash.", "[deleted]", "That\u2019s why I try to avoid taking leftovers home whenever I can.

I also don\u2019t drink alcohol, and usually order water. I still leave a decent tip if service was good.", "NTA but I will say some restauraunts don't let adults order off the kids menu because the kids meal is typically cheaper beyond it just being smaller. They actually price it at a lower rate than adult meals. To provide an example because I feel I'm explaining it poorly. An adult meal might be $10 for 2 pounds of food (simple math $5 a lb) but a kids meal of 1 pound of food might be only 3.50 or 4 instead of 5.

I\u2019d rather get a smaller portion from the kids menu to eat most or all of it than get a full size meal.", "LOL that's my go to if the server is rude or terrible.", "American tipping culture is wild. If 6.5% really was 6% more than they deserved, you should have tipped 0.5% why are you paying for someone to (figuratively) tell you \u201cfuck you\u201d when plenty out there will do it for free?", ">Also, servers often use tips to pay out kitchen and host/ess employees\n\nNot my problem.

I actually had to go up to the host to get my check because my waitress was schmoozing a large party of 8, figuring that me,  a single, more mature woman eating alone  wasn't worth her time...thing is, I literally told myself I was going to give my server a 20 dollar tip because the food at the place is phenomenal...but, she didn't behave like MY server.  I had to interrupt her to ORDER my food! The check was 24 bucks, if she'd only not judged a customer by the way they look, she'd have been pleased. And I fuckin DUG in my purse for that penny and picked the dirtiest one, she was horrible. I told the host too when I went to get my check, so she'd know what she missed.  Servers who make judgements about people instead of simply being gracious and doing their actual JOB is just awful. I KNOW how hard they work, I WAS one!   So I have a deep appreciation...some people are just bent on self destruct because they judge.", "Because both of my parents and my brother spent years working in restaurants (and my brother still is). I know that waitstaff has to tip out busboys and dishwashers, and bartenders, and food runners, and the hosts, usually to the tune of 10% on each bill. If you tip less than that, it\u2019s literally costing them money to serve you. I still wanted to send a message so that\u2019s why I tipped the 6.5%, but knew that it would only cost her a few dollars as opposed to a significant amount.", "Ok? How is the OP's fault the restaurant takes part in bad business practices", "It\u2019s not up to the customers to make sure a business stays in the green. That\u2019s up to the business.

I\u2019m always going to leave something because no one, even if their attitude or service was awful, should have to pay to serve me.", "Never said it was. It's up to the business if they want to offer kids meals to adults though. OP wouldn't take no for an answer.", "I think the disconnect is not everyone wants an American portion of food. It's not the cost, it's the amount of food.", "No problem", "I felt a little bad, but I was treating 5 people to lunch (as a thank you for letting me stay there), and I realized I could give her all my cash, and leave a tip that let me know exactly how her attitude was received, without costing her a ridiculous amount. It was less than $10 shy of 10% and different restaurants have different policies.", "Did you miss the part where there was no age limit?", "Sorry you\u2019re clinging to every last cent that a customer *might* give you - tipping culture really has you in its grip.", "Thank you for being aware of this. Food waste is a major problem because people don\u2019t think about all of the resources that go into even just a drink of plain water.

Completely ignored the animal was sacrificed for his meal, and all of the resources that went into it were partially wasted as well.", "I never blocked you lmao???\n\nLeave me aloneeee", "It didnt say \"no age limit\" though. It was under KIDS menu. I know, critical thinking is hard", "Server does that enough times, she won't even have enough to tip out, and the restaurant will fire her if she complains. \n\nThen they can go find a job where insulting the customer doesn't affect their income. \n\nOr they'll smarten up and quit insulting the customer.", ">Leave me aloneeee\n\nYour the one who unblocked me.
