Our parents split custody of us but as you can imagine, it was not a beautiful, everyone is BFFs kind of blended family. Dad was hurt. Dad still probably is in some ways. Mom is the one who told us what happened when we were still small (maybe when we were around 5 and 6) because she thought we were confused by the fact dad wasn't going to meet her and my stepdad's baby and the fact we weren't around the baby all the time, which is something she thought we were sad about. We were never confused about dad not being around the baby. We knew why. Because the baby was not his kid like we were his kids. We also weren't exactly sad because babies are loud and we loved our dad's. His house had him, we had more outdoor space and we had kids to play with in the neighborhood. I think it did more harm than good the way mom talked about it because she came across to us, like she wanted us to dislike dad for being mad at her for leaving him for our stepdad. There was a point a year ago too where my sister said she felt like mom wanted us to say we were glad it happened or something. I kinda got that too. But my sister could put it into words where I couldn't before.\n\nMy parents don't really talk. I don't think dad is mad anymore but he's never going to go out of his way for mom or our stepdad. I don't think he's wrong for that either. They don't care about his feelings. And our half siblings aren't any of his concern so it's never going to bother me.\n\nA couple of years ago my mom and stepdad got into a car accident while we were all in school. My sister and I were at dad's that week so he picked us up from school like normal. I'm not sure who asked or how many different people asked him but at least one person asked if he could pick up my half siblings from school when he picked us up (they were in different schools but they are right next to each other). My dad said no and he didn't take them. But someone communicated badly because my half siblings were left there and it became a whole ordeal. My dad ended up being painted as the bad guy. My half siblings were made very aware of the fact my dad didn't pick them up and how wrong others thought that was. My dad is now spoken about like he owed something and didn't follow through. My stepdad has called him a petty asshole.\n\nI'm tired of it and when my mom and stepdad were bitching about how cruel he was to my half siblings, I told them my dad didn't owe their kids anything and given how much my half siblings speak crap about my dad, they were making them just as entitled as the two of them are. That they should never have been told shit and should not think my dad owes them something. They tried to ground me for speaking to them that way and I told them they were ridiculous and I was so done with them. My mom said I am the oldest and should be more compassionate and understanding. She also accused me of being like my dad.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682858745, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133o93x/aita_for_telling_my_mom_and_stepdad_my_dad_doesnt/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You dad is under no obligation to care for your half siblings. I\u2019ve lived in three different states (US) and schools have always required at least two emergency contacts.  The school is at fault for not going to their emergency contact list and calling those people.\n\nYou simply spoke the truth.  Your mom and stepdad don\u2019t want to accept any accountability for their roles in what led up to your dad\u2019s refusal so they lashed out at you.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'd just take it as a compliment that you are like your dad. Because she's implying you're not like her. And she is the person who cheated and broke up a family.\n\nAnd how do she and her new husband think it's ok to expect her ex on whom she cheated with new husband is person to expect help from? Don't they have other family and friends? That's pretty serious level entitlement right there!!!", "You\u2019re NTA, not at all.\n\nFirst of all, your Dad was not obligated to pick up kids that weren\u2019t his. He doesn\u2019t even need a reason for that, but in this instance he had a couple of very good reasons. Not only his personal distress and discomfort, but also that this is the kind of situation where accusations fly left and right if something goes wrong. Good on your Dad for having appropriate boundaries. \n\nYour Dad should actually never have been asked in the first place. He was not the appropriate person and should not have been placed in that position. This is then entirely on the people who didn\u2019t communicate properly and find an appropriate person. \n\nI think it is fantastic that you are standing up for your Dad. Your Mum and StepDad are engaging in behaviours designed to drive a wedge between you and your Dad, which is both unfair and harmful to you. They\u2019re trying to basically cover up their own poor behaviour by painting him as the bad guy whenever they can. They can\u2019t accept responsibility.", "NTA. Your mother is wrong to talk badly about your father, especially in front of you, and she is doubly wrong to threaten to ground you for voicing your feelings. Parents should not put their children in the middle of their disputes. And, you are right. Your father doesn\u2019t owe your mother anything. It was wrong of anyone to ask him to pick up the children of his ex-wife\u2019s husband.", "NTA\n\nAll you did was stand up for your dad. To be fair, there is a lot you could have said that would have been way worse.\n\nInfo: \nDoes their school not require someone on the list to pick kids up? I know at our school you can have a list of approved people for pickups.\n\nIf so, why was your dad even on it? He has never had anything to do with their kids.", "NTA. Your entitled Mom, Stepdad and half siblings are the AH here.", "NTA- your dad doesn\u2019t owe them anything at all.", "NTA, neither is your father. \n\nSucks for the younger step-siblings, but while it would have been nice for him to pick them up, it is in no way expected that a man would care for the kids his ex had with the person she left him for. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d have done it. Maybe if it was \u201cplease pick them up and take them to X\u201d, but I wouldn\u2019t have kept them. \n\nThese kids and their father, and your mother, seem to be really shitty to your father. Sure can\u2019t expect favors from him in that case.", "NTA, I think your dad made the right decision especially since he didn\u2019t want to assume liability if something happened to those kids.", "Good for you! Your father is too gracious to say more. So good on you for speaking up for him! \n\nYour father did the right thing. Had he picked the step siblings up, and anything unfortunate happened, there would be more problems. \n\nSome people really do have some nerve.", "Would your Dad even be allowed to take your step siblings? Im not a parent but ive seen how reports of schools requiring lists of approved adults (i had to be added to my nephews to pick him up from school) and he has no actual relationship to your step siblings so why would he be on 'thier' list?", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are still dwelling on this mix up years later????", "NTA. Your father has handled everything appropriately.\n\nWhat your mother is doing is called parental alienation and it's shitty. Your mom and stepdad are responsible for their own children. They are also responsible for being decent human beings to you and your sister. They are failing.\n\nIf you're old enough, most courts will listen to where you want to live if 50-50 doesn't work anymore. They also take parental alienation very seriously. Talk to your dad and your sister if things need to change.", "Gonna go with NTA unless explicitly agreed with your Dad he probably legally couldn't have picked them up since he legally is not related to them.\n\nEven if he was on file thanks to your Mom as an adult that could collect them if your Dad wasn't consulted it would be a tough legal situation.\n\nFinally I get thr impression you Dad has almost no relationship with these kids so he probably wants to stay out of it altogether.", "NTA\n\nHigh compliment there, be like your dad, don't take their shit. Your mom and step dad don't seem to make an effort to find their peace, instead they go out of their way fuel their rage with petty bs all the time. Worse yet, they seem intent on infecting their kids with the same mentality. If you're willing, you have a chance to convince your half siblings not to listen to them, but I would just bite my tongue and wait to be old enough to move to dad full time.", "NTA. Seriously? They expected your dad, who your mom cheated on, to do them a favor? Yes you're \ud83d\udcaf right about them being entitled.\n\nI'm not sure how old you are but some states allow teens to decide where they want to live after a divorce. Perhaps you should check to see if you can live with your dad all the time.", "it's not like your dad said he would pick them up and then intentionally left them there to wait. He said no. Nobody else could be arsed to pick them up, hardly his fault. \n\nNTA \n\nHe's a stranger to them, and they probably wouldn't think this is his fault if their parents didn't constantly talk like it was.", "NTA. Your mother should be more compassionate and understanding. She gets to live her life however she wants, but she can not expect everybody else to be happy for her, especially her ex husband that she left with someone else. She should never ask him for any favors about her step-kids.", "NTA - better you being like your dad than like your mom. She left him when she had a TWO MONTH OLD BABY. And she had y'all in rapid succession. It's all very weird on her part.\n\nThe fact that she tries to get you and your sister in side with bashing him is petty and classless. It's not a good way to parent. Unless he abused her, there is no reason to badmouth him to you.", "NTA \n\nIf they say that you are just like your father, say thank you", "Are you old enough to choose where you want to live?", "Nta for saying that, it is the truth he owes them nothing. But I do believe he should have done it anyway because it was the decent thing to do. They weren't looking for someone to babysit so they could have a date night. It was an accident they both had. They are kids, innocent kids, that are his own childrens' siblings...", "While your mother's children are not your dad's responsibility it is common decency to take care of kids when the parents are in an accident. Neighbours have done as much for me.\n\nYour dad wouldn't have been going out his way to do it as he was picking you up at the next door school anyway. So unless there was another reason it was at least comment worthy that he declined to do so. Wudln't you have thought it petty if your dad had been the one in the accident and your step dad had declined to collect you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure what country you are in but in the UK children abandoned at school can be taken into care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don't say how old you are but you should perhaps consider that you might not have an unbiased view od either your mother's decision to leave your father or your fathers response.", "Info: Do you resent or blame your Mom for the divorce?", "Wait. You're saying your half siblings are being taught to be entitled because....your mom and step dad asked your dad to pickup the other kids from school after a car accident and were upset that he didn't?\n\nThis isn't your siblings fault. \n\nYou, as the oldest, were safe and sound and cared nothing about your younger siblings.
