Our parents split custody of us but as you can imagine, it was not a beautiful, everyone is BFFs kind of blended family. Dad was hurt. Dad still probably is in some ways. Mom is the one who told us what happened when we were still small (maybe when we were around 5 and 6) because she thought we were confused by the fact dad wasn't going to meet her and my stepdad's baby and the fact we weren't around the baby all the time, which is something she thought we were sad about. We were never confused about dad not being around the baby. We knew why. Because the baby was not his kid like we were his kids. We also weren't exactly sad because babies are loud and we loved our dad's. His house had him, we had more outdoor space and we had kids to play with in the neighborhood. I think it did more harm than good the way mom talked about it because she came across to us, like she wanted us to dislike dad for being mad at her for leaving him for our stepdad. There was a point a year ago too where my sister said she felt like mom wanted us to say we were glad it happened or something. I kinda got that too. But my sister could put it into words where I couldn't before.\n\nMy parents don't really talk. I don't think dad is mad anymore but he's never going to go out of his way for mom or our stepdad. I don't think he's wrong for that either. They don't care about his feelings. And our half siblings aren't any of his concern so it's never going to bother me.\n\nA couple of years ago my mom and stepdad got into a car accident while we were all in school. My sister and I were at dad's that week so he picked us up from school like normal. I'm not sure who asked or how many different people asked him but at least one person asked if he could pick up my half siblings from school when he picked us up (they were in different schools but they are right next to each other). My dad said no and he didn't take them. But someone communicated badly because my half siblings were left there and it became a whole ordeal. My dad ended up being painted as the bad guy. My half siblings were made very aware of the fact my dad didn't pick them up and how wrong others thought that was. My dad is now spoken about like he owed something and didn't follow through. My stepdad has called him a petty asshole.\n\nI'm tired of it and when my mom and stepdad were bitching about how cruel he was to my half siblings, I told them my dad didn't owe their kids anything and given how much my half siblings speak crap about my dad, they were making them just as entitled as the two of them are. That they should never have been told shit and should not think my dad owes them something. They tried to ground me for speaking to them that way and I told them they were ridiculous and I was so done with them. My mom said I am the oldest and should be more compassionate and understanding.

You dad is under no obligation to care for your half siblings. I\u2019ve lived in three different states (US) and schools have always required at least two emergency contacts.  The school is at fault for not going to their emergency contact list and calling those people.\n\nYou simply spoke the truth.  Your mom and stepdad don\u2019t want to accept any accountability for their roles in what led up to your dad\u2019s refusal so they lashed out at you.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'd just take it as a compliment that you are like your dad. Because she's implying you're not like her. And she is the person who cheated and broke up a family.\n\nAnd how do she and her new husband think it's ok to expect her ex on whom she cheated with new husband is person to expect help from? Don't they have other family and friends? That's pretty serious level entitlement right there!!!", "You\u2019re NTA, not at all.\n\nFirst of all, your Dad was not obligated to pick up kids that weren\u2019t his. He doesn\u2019t even need a reason for that, but in this instance he had a couple of very good reasons. Not only his personal distress and discomfort, but also that this is the kind of situation where accusations fly left and right if something goes wrong. Good on your Dad for having appropriate boundaries. \n\nYour Dad should actually never have been asked in the first place. He was not the appropriate person and should not have been placed in that position. This is then entirely on the people who didn\u2019t communicate properly and find an appropriate person. \n\nI think it is fantastic that you are standing up for your Dad. Your Mum and StepDad are engaging in behaviours designed to drive a wedge between you and your Dad, which is both unfair and harmful to you. They\u2019re trying to basically cover up their own poor behaviour by painting him as the bad guy whenever they can. They can\u2019t accept responsibility.", "NTA. Your mother is wrong to talk badly about your father, especially in front of you, and she is doubly wrong to threaten to ground you for voicing your feelings. Parents should not put their children in the middle of their disputes. And, you are right. Your father doesn\u2019t owe your mother anything. It was wrong of anyone to ask him to pick up the children of his ex-wife\u2019s husband.", "NTA\n\nAll you did was stand up for your dad. To be fair, there is a lot you could have said that would have been way worse.\n\nInfo: \nDoes their school not require someone on the list to pick kids up?

Maybe if it was \u201cplease pick them up and take them to X\u201d, but I wouldn\u2019t have kept them. \n\nThese kids and their father, and your mother, seem to be really shitty to your father.

Your father is too gracious to say more. So good on you for speaking up for him! \n\nYour father did the right thing.

Your father has handled everything appropriately.\n\nWhat your mother is doing is called parental alienation and it's shitty. Your mom and stepdad are responsible for their own children. They are also responsible for being decent human beings to you and your sister.

Talk to your dad and your sister if things need to change.", "Gonna go with NTA unless explicitly agreed with your Dad he probably legally couldn't have picked them up since he legally is not related to them.\n\nEven if he was on file thanks to your Mom as an adult that could collect them if your Dad wasn't consulted it would be a tough legal situation.\n\nFinally I get thr impression you Dad has almost no relationship with these kids so he probably wants to stay out of it altogether.", "NTA\n\nHigh compliment there, be like your dad, don't take their shit. Your mom and step dad don't seem to make an effort to find their peace, instead they go out of their way fuel their rage with petty bs all the time. Worse yet, they seem intent on infecting their kids with the same mentality. If you're willing, you have a chance to convince your half siblings not to listen to them, but I would just bite my tongue and wait to be old enough to move to dad full time.", "NTA. Seriously? They expected your dad, who your mom cheated on, to do them a favor? Yes you're \ud83d\udcaf right about them being entitled.\n\nI'm not sure how old you are but some states allow teens to decide where they want to live after a divorce. Perhaps you should check to see if you can live with your dad all the time.", "it's not like your dad said he would pick them up and then intentionally left them there to wait. He said no. Nobody else could be arsed to pick them up, hardly his fault. \n\nNTA \n\nHe's a stranger to them, and they probably wouldn't think this is his fault if their parents didn't constantly talk like it was.", "NTA. Your mother should be more compassionate and understanding. She gets to live her life however she wants, but she can not expect everybody else to be happy for her, especially her ex husband that she left with someone else. She should never ask him for any favors about her step-kids.", "NTA - better you being like your dad than like your mom. She left him when she had a TWO MONTH OLD BABY. And she had y'all in rapid succession. It's all very weird on her part.\n\nThe fact that she tries to get you and your sister in side with bashing him is petty and classless. It's not a good way to parent. Unless he abused her, there is no reason to badmouth him to you.", "NTA \n\nIf they say that you are just like your father, say thank you", "Are you old enough to choose where you want to live?", "Nta for saying that, it is the truth he owes them nothing. But I do believe he should have done it anyway because it was the decent thing to do. They weren't looking for someone to babysit so they could have a date night. It was an accident they both had. They are kids, innocent kids, that are his own childrens' siblings...", "While your mother's children are not your dad's responsibility it is common decency to take care of kids when the parents are in an accident. Neighbours have done as much for me.\n\nYour dad wouldn't have been going out his way to do it as he was picking you up at the next door school anyway. So unless there was another reason it was at least comment worthy that he declined to do so.

You're saying your half siblings are being taught to be entitled because....your mom and step dad asked your dad to pickup the other kids from school after a car accident and were upset that he didn't?\n\nThis isn't your siblings fault. \n\nYou, as the oldest, were safe and sound and cared nothing about your younger siblings.

Instead a person not on the list has my permission today to pick up my child.\n\nThis comment thread made me think they have never verified that I am the parent on the phone during a call like that", ">  if you are not a designated emergency contact a school cannot release children to you.\n\nI don't like this phrasing. They absolutely can do that, they just might not be allowed to.", "Not anymore. Schools are very concerned about liability. At the small parochial school where I taught there was a dismissal procedure. Students from your classroom who went home by bus would get in one line and an aide would take them to the bus. I would take my students who were picked up by parents outside and stand with them in my assigned spot outside. As a student's parent would drive up, I would let that student go to their car. Then any student who walked home would be walked to the edge of the school grounds by an aide or teacher. If a student was going to go home with anyone different, such as a grandparent, there had to be a written note from the parents or the school secretary had to talk to the parents on the phone.", "Not anymore. Schools have tighter security now.", "Which is so scary to think about. When I've had to have someone else collect my kids, they don't ask for my their birthday, a description of the person picking them up, or any other confirmation.", "Oh man, I hate it when I get the pronouns wrong.", "Given the ages of her children at the time of divorce and the other context provided I would be quite surprised if OPs mom didn't cheat.", "Sexual cheating or emotional cheating; you don't break a marriage for someone else if you were on the straight and narrow.", "So he can only operate with the knowledge that his parents have given him, and the behavior he has personally seen. That's what he is doing.", "I probably don't but what I do know came from my mom, not my dad.", "So if only the parents are on the list, the kids must stay in the school indefinitely? Obviously there are exceptions made for situations like this", "Agreed.", "They did make the call. They made that call when they didn\u2019t actually properly assign an emergency contact for when something like this happens! Clearly they didn\u2019t. \n\nWTF are you even spouting in your second half? There is no confused timeline. There is no unlikely misconduct scenario, because it is very likely, especially when it involves a woman who talks shit about you, WHICH she WAS doing before this incident.  There\u2019s a reason schools have a list of people that have been okayed to pick up certain kids these days. OP\u2019s dad is not on that list. If he is on that list, he sure as frick didn\u2019t agree to being on it. \n\nAlso what does the dad bring bitter have anything to do with fricking anything? If anything, his bitterness is well deserved, because it\u2019s clear that the divorce happened because she cheated.", "I respectfully disagree.  With all the negative things swirling about between these parents, it makes total sense that the girls' father did not want to be responsible for the affair partners' child responsibilities.  If the adults had managed a reasonable and respectful relationship, I might feel differently and he may have too, but I in no way hold him responsible for tending his ex-wife's children that he did not sire no matter what.  This father is NTA.", "I think it's different with neighbors because assuming you do it for them, there is no bad blood. Might not be the most familiar but things are at least on semi friendly terms or nothing bad happened. I know not everyone will agree with me but I don't think it was wrong for my dad to say no.", "So? He has not agreed to being an emergency contact to pick up those kids.", "So then they need to call their family and friends not OP dad who by all means gets the wrong end of the stick when it involves OP mom and stepdad. Please don't speak about being humane, humanity went out the door when OP mom chose to cheat and ruined OP family for her needs.", "Sorry i misread! Thanks for pointing it out.", "It's not that bizarre if you're as entitleded as the mother seems to be...\n\nShe expects her ex to be totally cool with her and the guy she left him to be with. It's good to be civil towards them (especially with kids involved) but you don't owe them anything. It's like the mother believes that she's entitled to stop, start and define the relationship between her and the father according to her own whims at any time.", "I also think that's weird. Afaik, I am an emergency contact for my niece (not really an issue since she's doing virtual this year), & for the kids of a close single mom friend. I know this because the parents asked me if I was OK with it. IOW- Would you be willing to drop everything at a moment's notice for my children in case of emergency?\n\nSchools are already underfunded, so I kinda understand it not getting verified. But I'm shocked by how many cases I see on here of parents who do stuff like this without checking. I mean, it's only your *child*. (last sentence needs sarcasm font)", "Ya like I'd understand if the kids all got along and the parents where ok with eachother. So if both sets of kids wanted to play together after school or in the case of an emergency like this if bio dad is the only close family or friend to look after them. But clearly this is not the case.", "Dad must be a really trustworthy and good man for that to happen. It says everything about Mom and stepdad.", "Just in case a Lifetime movie breaks out unexpectedly.", "Oh absolutely, I'm glad she wasn't mad at you guys. I know how people can some times take their anger out on the wrong people", "Oh absolutely, I know it's probably not THAT big of a problem in general but I can also see there being situations where there are... But honestly it also just might be because I've been on this subreddit way too much lately ._.", "Not after elementary school, in my area.", "That's what I said.", "Fair enough. Reasonable people can disagree. If you notice I put mild A for exactly same reasons you described. However, I personally think that relationship between adults are secondary when it comes to helping kids in the time of crisis.", "Should we act as decent human beings only when we agree to do it in advance?  \n\nIt would have been comforting for kids to be with their step siblings with whom they are very familiar at the time of stress. The schools were next to each other so it was not big effort either.", "I guarantee stepdad is the affair partner she got caught with.", ">  I mean, it's only your child.\n\nIt seems to a lot of them their child is just a means to an end, not a real person but just a tool to use for their own ambitions.", "My old high school called my mom to come get a neighbor\u2019s kid one day. My mom barely knew the kid\u2019s parents and didn\u2019t even know she was on the pickup list. No family still attended the school and the school was small enough that everyone pretty much knew each other. I guess the neighbors thought my mom would be embarrassed by what the kid was wearing (highly offensive outfit) and just quickly bring her home and they wouldn\u2019t get any backlash. They obviously didn\u2019t know my mother. She let everyone have it. The school, the teacher, the 14 year old, and the parents. By the time she had finally gotten the parents to come get their child (they pretended not to be home and waited an hour), the entire town knew that my mom didn\u2019t appreciate the inconvenience nor the stunt the child pulled and the school had to finally enforce the policy that had been in place for 30 years. To be fair, the school secretary probably wanted the blow up to happen but did think she\u2019d be caught in the crossfire.", "Same. That was only elementary where I am. Middle and high school they just come out and get in whatever car.", "Since OP is at least 5-6 years older than half siblings and they go to different schools I made the assumption that the half siblings were most likely still in elementary.\n\nI could be wrong.\n\nYou are correct that beyond elementary schools are less strict about pick ups so that would be a different story.", "In my area that\u2019s only for kindergarten. First grade and up can simply leave.", "Yes, he was asked a little before or as he was driving to pick my sister and I up. He said no and nothing else was done to make sure they were picked up.", "Because that\u2019s not how life works? He could get into serious trouble for picking up kids he\u2019s not supposed to, never mind kids he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with. It\u2019s on the mother and step dad who did not arrange a proper emergency contact.", "Well yes, that\u2019s in OP\u2019s first sentence after the title.", "How much money you going to get back if you can't fulfill that guarantee?", "Half the high schoolers are getting in their own or each others' cars anyway and some of them look like full grown adults. It'd be basically impossible to enforce.", "So yeah, it was entirely on them, then.  Dad was clear, he said no, at that point it was on them to continue to make other arrangements.  I'm confused as to what they were thinking after that, that somehow he would change his mind and not inform them?  That is just weird.", "Fair enough and absolutely fair point on parent's responsibility.  However, I rather know people who would pick up kids in these circumstances than those who wouldn't...", "\ud83d\udcaf% Well said thank you."]}
