Our parents split custody of us but as you can imagine, it was not a beautiful, everyone is BFFs kind of blended family. Dad was hurt. Dad still probably is in some ways. Mom is the one who told us what happened when we were still small (maybe when we were around 5 and 6) because she thought we were confused by the fact dad wasn't going to meet her and my stepdad's baby and the fact we weren't around the baby all the time, which is something she thought we were sad about. We were never confused about dad not being around the baby. We knew why. Because the baby was not his kid like we were his kids. We also weren't exactly sad because babies are loud and we loved our dad's. His house had him, we had more outdoor space and we had kids to play with in the neighborhood. I think it did more harm than good the way mom talked about it because she came across to us, like she wanted us to dislike dad for being mad at her for leaving him for our stepdad. There was a point a year ago too where my sister said she felt like mom wanted us to say we were glad it happened or something. I kinda got that too. But my sister could put it into words where I couldn't before.\n\nMy parents don't really talk. I don't think dad is mad anymore but he's never going to go out of his way for mom or our stepdad. I don't think he's wrong for that either. They don't care about his feelings. And our half siblings aren't any of his concern so it's never going to bother me.\n\nA couple of years ago my mom and stepdad got into a car accident while we were all in school. My sister and I were at dad's that week so he picked us up from school like normal. I'm not sure who asked or how many different people asked him but at least one person asked if he could pick up my half siblings from school when he picked us up (they were in different schools but they are right next to each other). My dad said no and he didn't take them. But someone communicated badly because my half siblings were left there and it became a whole ordeal. My dad ended up being painted as the bad guy. My half siblings were made very aware of the fact my dad didn't pick them up and how wrong others thought that was. My dad is now spoken about like he owed something and didn't follow through. My stepdad has called him a petty asshole.\n\nI'm tired of it and when my mom and stepdad were bitching about how cruel he was to my half siblings, I told them my dad didn't owe their kids anything and given how much my half siblings speak crap about my dad, they were making them just as entitled as the two of them are. That they should never have been told shit and should not think my dad owes them something. They tried to ground me for speaking to them that way and I told them they were ridiculous and I was so done with them. My mom said I am the oldest and should be more compassionate and understanding.

You dad is under no obligation to care for your half siblings. I\u2019ve lived in three different states (US) and schools have always required at least two emergency contacts.  The school is at fault for not going to their emergency contact list and calling those people.\n\nYou simply spoke the truth.  Your mom and stepdad don\u2019t want to accept any accountability for their roles in what led up to your dad\u2019s refusal so they lashed out at you.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'd just take it as a compliment that you are like your dad. Because she's implying you're not like her. And she is the person who cheated and broke up a family.\n\nAnd how do she and her new husband think it's ok to expect her ex on whom she cheated with new husband is person to expect help from? Don't they have other family and friends? That's pretty serious level entitlement right there!!!", "You\u2019re NTA, not at all.\n\nFirst of all, your Dad was not obligated to pick up kids that weren\u2019t his. He doesn\u2019t even need a reason for that, but in this instance he had a couple of very good reasons. Not only his personal distress and discomfort, but also that this is the kind of situation where accusations fly left and right if something goes wrong. Good on your Dad for having appropriate boundaries. \n\nYour Dad should actually never have been asked in the first place. He was not the appropriate person and should not have been placed in that position. This is then entirely on the people who didn\u2019t communicate properly and find an appropriate person. \n\nI think it is fantastic that you are standing up for your Dad. Your Mum and StepDad are engaging in behaviours designed to drive a wedge between you and your Dad, which is both unfair and harmful to you. They\u2019re trying to basically cover up their own poor behaviour by painting him as the bad guy whenever they can. They can\u2019t accept responsibility.", "NTA. Your mother is wrong to talk badly about your father, especially in front of you, and she is doubly wrong to threaten to ground you for voicing your feelings. Parents should not put their children in the middle of their disputes. And, you are right. Your father doesn\u2019t owe your mother anything. It was wrong of anyone to ask him to pick up the children of his ex-wife\u2019s husband.", "NTA\n\nAll you did was stand up for your dad. To be fair, there is a lot you could have said that would have been way worse.\n\nInfo: \nDoes their school not require someone on the list to pick kids up?

Maybe if it was \u201cplease pick them up and take them to X\u201d, but I wouldn\u2019t have kept them. \n\nThese kids and their father, and your mother, seem to be really shitty to your father.

Your father is too gracious to say more. So good on you for speaking up for him! \n\nYour father did the right thing.

Your father has handled everything appropriately.\n\nWhat your mother is doing is called parental alienation and it's shitty. Your mom and stepdad are responsible for their own children. They are also responsible for being decent human beings to you and your sister.

Talk to your dad and your sister if things need to change.", "Gonna go with NTA unless explicitly agreed with your Dad he probably legally couldn't have picked them up since he legally is not related to them.\n\nEven if he was on file thanks to your Mom as an adult that could collect them if your Dad wasn't consulted it would be a tough legal situation.\n\nFinally I get thr impression you Dad has almost no relationship with these kids so he probably wants to stay out of it altogether.", "NTA\n\nHigh compliment there, be like your dad, don't take their shit. Your mom and step dad don't seem to make an effort to find their peace, instead they go out of their way fuel their rage with petty bs all the time. Worse yet, they seem intent on infecting their kids with the same mentality. If you're willing, you have a chance to convince your half siblings not to listen to them, but I would just bite my tongue and wait to be old enough to move to dad full time.", "NTA. Seriously? They expected your dad, who your mom cheated on, to do them a favor? Yes you're \ud83d\udcaf right about them being entitled.\n\nI'm not sure how old you are but some states allow teens to decide where they want to live after a divorce. Perhaps you should check to see if you can live with your dad all the time.", "it's not like your dad said he would pick them up and then intentionally left them there to wait. He said no. Nobody else could be arsed to pick them up, hardly his fault. \n\nNTA \n\nHe's a stranger to them, and they probably wouldn't think this is his fault if their parents didn't constantly talk like it was.", "NTA. Your mother should be more compassionate and understanding. She gets to live her life however she wants, but she can not expect everybody else to be happy for her, especially her ex husband that she left with someone else. She should never ask him for any favors about her step-kids.", "NTA - better you being like your dad than like your mom. She left him when she had a TWO MONTH OLD BABY. And she had y'all in rapid succession. It's all very weird on her part.\n\nThe fact that she tries to get you and your sister in side with bashing him is petty and classless. It's not a good way to parent. Unless he abused her, there is no reason to badmouth him to you.", "NTA \n\nIf they say that you are just like your father, say thank you", "Are you old enough to choose where you want to live?", "Nta for saying that, it is the truth he owes them nothing. But I do believe he should have done it anyway because it was the decent thing to do. They weren't looking for someone to babysit so they could have a date night. It was an accident they both had. They are kids, innocent kids, that are his own childrens' siblings...", "While your mother's children are not your dad's responsibility it is common decency to take care of kids when the parents are in an accident. Neighbours have done as much for me.\n\nYour dad wouldn't have been going out his way to do it as he was picking you up at the next door school anyway. So unless there was another reason it was at least comment worthy that he declined to do so.

You're saying your half siblings are being taught to be entitled because....your mom and step dad asked your dad to pickup the other kids from school after a car accident and were upset that he didn't?\n\nThis isn't your siblings fault. \n\nYou, as the oldest, were safe and sound and cared nothing about your younger siblings.

I would take my students who were picked up by parents outside and stand with them in my assigned spot outside. As a student's parent would drive up, I would let that student go to their car. Then any student who walked home would be walked to the edge of the school grounds by an aide or teacher.

You spoke truth to power & that rarely goes well if power isn\u2019t willing/able to accept it.    \n\nYour mom & stepdad are the AHs for the exact reasons that you described.  They want others (at least one) to accept responsibilities for things that they aren\u2019t responsible for (your dad for anything to do with their kids) - but they don\u2019t want to accept responsibilities for things that they themselves are responsible for (their behavior towards your father & you).  \n\nI believe that it was all a misunderstanding.  I  believe that because is not reasonable to believe otherwise given the facts.  One or more people called your dad, informed him of the accident & asked him to pick up the children.  It comes down to which of the following is more likely to be true.  Did the caller - in their rush to help your mom & step-dad during a medical emergency - mishear or misunderstand your father\u2019s response when he said no?  Or did your father - a man who didn\u2019t see it coming when his own wife left him for another man when their own children were still babies - get this unexpected call & request & instantly recognize & seize the opportunity to exact some revenge against your parents by lying to say he\u2019d pickup their children but having no plans to actually do so?  A misunderstanding is more reasonable than the alternative.  \n\nRegardless, they are speaking poorly about a man that THEY wrong - horrifically & without provocation.  Even if your dad deliberately didn\u2019t pick up their children, they had an affair, ended his marriage & tore apart the family that he\u2019d created.  Which behavior was more abhorrent?  Who was the bigger AH?  So they shouldn\u2019t be speaking poorly about a man who they wronged first & more egregiously than he could ever hope to match.  \n\nAlso, they shouldn\u2019t be speaking poorly about your father in any manner that you can hear &/or hear about.  That\u2019s them being an AH to YOU - not just your father.  (There\u2019s a reason judges consider that child abuse & will consider one parent maligning another when deciding custody.)  \n\nThey take it a step further by allowing & encouraging your step-siblings to malign your father in a manner that you can hear &/or hear about.  So they\u2019ve not only been being an AH to you with their abusive language regarding your father - they\u2019ve also been recruiting their children to do the same.  \n\nLastly, your mother\u2019s response in the end illustrate just how selfish & abusive she is.  \n\nFirst, they have openly spoken poorly about your father in front of you.  They have allowed others to do so.  They have encouraged their children to do so.  And they\u2019ve done all this for over 2 years.  \n\nSecondly, when you spoke up in defense of your father, they tried to punish you.  Your mother had the audacity to say YOU should be more compassionate and understanding.  \n\nLastly, your mother said you were \u201cacting like your father\u201d.  She \u201caccused you\u201d of behaving like the man she choose to abandon (after creating a family with him in favor of another).  \n\nYour step-dad is an abusive AH.  Your mother is a super-sized abusive AH.  They\u2019re indoctrinating their children into the abusive AH ministry as well.  \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d move in with dad full time.

People who cheat and then break up their family for their AP frequently have a sense of entitlement to, among other things, the expectation that everyone just treat it as if nothing amoral or hurtful happened. Nevermind that they gouged out their victims heart with a spoon and spat in their face when they cried, no it's the victim of the affairs fault for expecting them to love them. Sad part? There are people who will make excuses for the cheater/AP couple on any number of bases from, \"you can't help what you want, so you should just get over it,\" onward to, \"people don't cheat for no reason, what did the victim do to justify this?\"\n\n>My parents don't really talk. I don't think dad is mad anymore but he's never going to go out of his way for mom or our stepdad.\n\nPerfectly reasonable.

There've been quite a few threads on here where the cheating spouse and their new family invent this narrative of entitlement to the resources, affection, and time of the offended party and vilify them for not stepping in. In all cases where the kids believe this it's because the parents pumped it into their head. Age and maturity rarely seems to fix this mentality either as they adopt it as a sort of core world view, one they don't question even when acting hypocritically.\n\n>They tried to ground me for speaking to them that way and I told them they were ridiculous and I was so done with them.

He has been wrongfully scapegoated for an unfaithful woman's inability to organize a recognized network of support for her children for emergency situations. That is on her and her husband.

He is under no obligation to pick them up, but at the same time; these were exceptional circumstances. It\u2019s not like they were off gallivanting somewhere, it was an emergency situation. But there should have been clear communication.", "NTA.  You spoke truth to power & that rarely goes well if power isn\u2019t willing/able to accept it.    \n\nYour mom & stepdad are the AHs for the exact reasons that you described.  They want others (at least one) to accept responsibilities for things that they aren\u2019t responsible for (your dad for anything to do with their kids) - but they don\u2019t want to accept responsibilities for things that they themselves are responsible for (their behavior towards your father & you).  \n\nI believe that it was all a misunderstanding.  I  believe that because is not reasonable to believe otherwise given the facts.  One or more people called your dad, informed him of the accident & asked him to pick up the children.  It comes down to which of the following is more likely to be true.  Did the caller - in their rush to help your mom & step-dad during a medical emergency - mishear or misunderstand your father\u2019s response when he said no?  Or did your father - a man who didn\u2019t see it coming when his own wife left him for another man when their own children were still babies - get this unexpected call & request & instantly recognize & seize the opportunity to exact some revenge against your parents by lying to say he\u2019d pickup their children but having no plans to actually do so?  A misunderstanding is more reasonable than the alternative.  \n\nRegardless, they are speaking poorly about a man that THEY wrong - horrifically & without provocation.  Even if your dad deliberately didn\u2019t pick up their children, they had an affair, ended his marriage & tore apart the family that he\u2019d created.  Which behavior was more abhorrent?  Who was the bigger AH?  So they shouldn\u2019t be speaking poorly about a man who they wronged first & more egregiously than he could ever hope to match.  \n\nAlso, they shouldn\u2019t be speaking poorly about your father in any manner that you can hear &/or hear about.  That\u2019s them being an AH to YOU - not just your father.  (There\u2019s a reason judges consider that child abuse & will consider one parent maligning another when deciding custody.)  \n\nThey take it a step further by allowing & encouraging your step-siblings to malign your father in a manner that you can hear &/or hear about.  So they\u2019ve not only been being an AH to you with their abusive language regarding your father - they\u2019ve also been recruiting their children to do the same.  \n\nLastly, your mother\u2019s response in the end illustrate just how selfish & abusive she is.  \n\nFirst, they have openly spoken poorly about your father in front of you.  They have allowed others to do so.  They have encouraged their children to do so.  And they\u2019ve done all this for over 2 years.  \n\nSecondly, when you spoke up in defense of your father, they tried to punish you.  Your mother had the audacity to say YOU should be more compassionate and understanding.  \n\nLastly, your mother said you were \u201cacting like your father\u201d.  She \u201caccused you\u201d of behaving like the man she choose to abandon (after creating a family with him in favor of another).  \n\nYour step-dad is an abusive AH.  Your mother is a super-sized abusive AH.  They\u2019re indoctrinating their children into the abusive AH ministry as well.  \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d move in with dad full time.  You don\u2019t need their skit.", "if the parents split amicably I could see how it would be ok for the dad to pick up his wifes kids. I mean if they were on good terms and all.

If it\u2019s not any longer, the human race is shittier than it used to be, IMO.", "True, but it means the kids are dealing with trauma with an adult they barely know. If something traumatic has happened, that\u2019s a really important time for them to be with Grandma or Uncle or a close family friend: someone they feel safe with and can process their emotions with. Given the choice between \u201cwith siblings and an adult they don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cseparated from siblings but with someone they trust\u201d I think I would pick the latter and make sure the two adults had each other\u2019s phone numbers so the siblings could have a phone conversation. \n\nOf course, not everyone has a huge support network, so sometimes you don\u2019t have those kinds of ideal options. I\u2019m really lucky to have family\u2014so, so much family\u2014living within the boundaries of my kids\u2019 school. But, even if I had to list a responsible stranger for my kids\u2019 emergency contact, I would definitely get that person\u2019s consent first.", "The point was that they are absolutely able to do that even if it is maybe not proper procedure so we can't assume they didn't or wouldn't do that just because it is forbidden.", "It was convenient to text the ex!", "Jesus fucking Christ, you are so condescending, that it's hard to read all the crap you are splitting out.", "I find it very worrying that your parents would leave you with strangers as an emergency plan. That\u2019s crazy. Because that\u2019s what OP\u2019s dad is, a stranger to these kids. They\u2019re not his. Common courtesy would\u2019ve been if the mom had not left him for another man and badmouthed him to his children but, hey! That\u2019s just me.", "Who has both a 2 yr old and a 1 yr old, and still has the time and energy to pursue an affair?!", "My mom got a phone call from the high school one day to come pick up one of my sister\u2019s friends. Mom was one of the few stay at home moms in the neighborhood, and both this kid\u2019s parents worked, so I guess the parents thought Mom would be cool helping out in an emergency.\n\nWell, the friend was throwing up and couldn\u2019t stay in school, so Mom brought her home and fed her ginger ale and saltines until her parents came home. The poor kid\u2019s parents did not get along and often told her they were only staying married until she was old enough to be on her own, and both of them were refusing to leave their work and come get their child. And Mom did not have it in her to leave the kid in the nurse\u2019s office, no matter how much she didn\u2019t really like this kid.\n\nThen Mom read the parents the riot act. They told her that they thought she\u2019d be fine with it since she was already the emergency contact for so many other kids in the neighborhood. In fact, they got the idea from another set of parents, this time the parents of one of my brother\u2019s friends.\n\nWhich is how Mom found out that she was unknowingly the emergency contact for 5 kids who were not hers.", "I don't know how this works on USA, but in Brasil, we have a lot of poor familys that don't have phone, internet or even food everyday.\n\nSo, I can see a lot of children without emergency contacts because the family is too poor to afford something like that.", "That's really scary in today's world.  Our schools elem & middle, require only people listed can get the children.", "It\u2019s a shame they\u2019ve been so weird and shitty to OP\u2019s dad then. Not doing that would probably have been more convenient for everyone.", "OP\u2019s dad isn\u2019t a stranger but this was a fun false equivalency.", "This is in the US. My mom\u2019s area was poor enough that some of the parents might not have been able to afford phones. But it wasn\u2019t slum poor: even if one family didn\u2019t have a phone, at least two of their close neighbors would. Not having home internet happens here, but it\u2019s very rare for people to not have a phone.\n\nIn my student\u2019s case, I knew the situation well enough to know money wasn\u2019t an issue. The mom had a stable career: she just changed phone carriers and didn\u2019t bother to inform the people in charge of her child 6 hours a day.", "I\u2019m super lucky to live in the community I live in. Children here still have a measure of freedom. By middle school, kids are roaming about without parental supervision.", "To the half siblings? He totally is. To this day he\u2019s never met those children. They do not know him apart from the BS they\u2019ve been told by their parents. He is a stranger to those kids. Duh", "Uh\u2026 he\u2019s a stranger they talk crap about? How is he a stranger if they know enough about him to talk crap?", "I think at some portion of the time cheating happens because the cheater feels that they aren't getting something they need from their partner (and to be fair, sometimes those needs are legitimate and actually AREN'T being met.) The problem comes from violating trust by going outside the relationship and get those needs met.\n\nSometimes the cheater even voices the needs to their partner BEFORE they cheat and it doesn't help for whatever reason. Sometimes there are extenuating circumstances that make it hard for the cheater to feel that they're safe and allowed to voice their needs (financial dependency, among other things, can factor into this.) Sometimes there are psychological issues in the cheater or the partner that make it harder to confront these issues.\n\nNone of that makes cheating the right thing to do. In almost all cases, it's better to talk to your partner about what you expect/need to get out of the relationship and whether they are meeting those needs or not... It's almost always healthier to end a relationship if it isn't meeting your needs rather than cheat. I would just say that in many cases, it's much more complicated than opportunity."]}
