{"id": 32517, "submission_id": "18crxpi", "title": "AITAH for refusing to go to holidays because my husband isn\u2019t invited?", "selftext": "My parents both don\u2019t like my husband and therefore he is not invited to holidays. He has made some mistakes in the past, but has been on a good path for about a year now. He has also apologized for his mistakes. Him and I have been working our differences out and he is ultimately my best friend. \n\nLast year he was not invited to Christmas at my moms. When I asked what I\u2019ll say when people ask why he didn\u2019t come, he responded, \u201cthey won\u2019t ask.\u201d That led me to believe that she blabbed her big mouth to her whole side of the family about MY relationship. Why wouldn\u2019t they ask?! I was livid. I told her I didn\u2019t want to go because it made me feel uncomfortable. I felt like she was being childish for not being able to put their differences aside for one holiday. We argued for a while and she ultimately called me \u201cselfish\u201d and gaslit me into going. I was anxious and uncomfortable the whole time. I told her not to even ask me to come next year.\n\nI also did not go to my dads last year for the same reason. However, his side would ask where my husband was because my dad doesn\u2019t have a huge mouth. But my grandmother is starting to get suspicious about why we\u2019re never around together at dinners with my dad. My husband and I visit my grandmother separately now, and never together with my dad and his wife. And she is also prying about why I wasn\u2019t at thanksgiving. At this point I\u2019m sick of lying to my grandmother. I told my dad that next time she asked I was just gonna tell her I didn\u2019t go because my husband isn\u2019t invited. He BEGGED me not to tell her because it would upset her. So I guess he wants me to lie to her forever. \n\nI told both of my parents that he is my family whether they like it or not. \n\nNow it\u2019s almost Christmas again. I\u2019m already getting pressured into going on both sides but I\u2019m going to refuse. My husband has no family. His only family in the state (his dad and grandmother) both passed away recently. The holidays are very lonely for him. So on top of just not wanting to go for myself, I don\u2019t want to leave the person I love alone on Christmas. \n\nMy dad will be upset but respect my decision. My mom will crucify me for it and tell me how self-centered I am.\n\nAITAH?", "created_utc": 1701941300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18crxpi/aitah_for_refusing_to_go_to_holidays_because_my/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This man is actively ruining your life with his substance abuse, lying about paying $3000 in rent, now you have a pending criminal charge that you took the bait for, and you don't know what else he has done behind your back. Who will be the ones helping you out financially, emotionally, and socially again once your \u201chusband\u201d shows his behind again, YOUR PARENTS! Apologies when it comes to the magnitude of what your husband has done, won't fix anything. On top of that, why would your parents trust him around their possessions and inside their homes? I think your anger is misplaced and you have to do some deep-down soul searching as to why you are still with him, why your family doesn't want him invited to place or around them, and if pushing your family away is a smart idea for yourself. Take your blinders off. If you are willing to isolate yourself from your family for a husband whom not even the dog or cat would trust, that is on you.

For example I found out I owed $3000 worth of rent money that he said he had been paying. He also relapsed after rehab and had trouble holding down jobs. When his father died he left me to go on a bender for a couple months. He\u2019s caused me a lot of depression in the past. The incident that made them cut him off is I took the fall for him and ended up with a possession charge so he didn\u2019t go to jail. Now I\u2019m dealing with a criminal charge. And as this all sounds horrible, he has since gotten a lot of help for not only his substance abuse but also his PTSD. The VA is sending him away for 90 for a veterans program for ptsd and substance abuse by HIS choice. He is making the decision to get himself straight. I think it\u2019s my choice to stand by him.\n\nOPs comment determined my answer.Sorry, but he treated you so disgustingly. Your parents don't have to be supportive of you being with him by inviting him to their home. He litterally let you take criminal charges for him.

He is an abusive jerk that endangers you, but you won't listen to anyones justified reasons for not wanting to be around him.\n\n>I felt like she was being childish for not being able to put their differences aside for one holiday.\n\nThis isn't about putting differences aside. While your husband may truly be working on himself, you both should know that doesn't mean everyone has to magically be tolerant of each other. Your parents are well within their rights to not want to \"put their differences aside\" for someone who litterally abused and used their daughter.\n\n>I told my dad that next time she asked I was just gonna tell her I didn\u2019t go because my husband isn\u2019t invited\n\nOh please do. Make sure to say WHY he isn't invited as well, since you didn't actually give us the info of why until you were asked many times. Don't leave out any details of how he used you, ya know, so Granny gets the full story.\n\n>I told both of my parents that he is my family whether they like it or not.\n\nCool. He is your family.

He\u2019s not standing up and taking responsibility. If you are married to a man letting you take the fall for him, he\u2019s not as interested in recovery as you think.

He has made some mistakes in the past, but has been on a good path for about a year now. He has also apologized for his mistakes. Him and I have been working our differences out and he is ultimately my best friend. \n\nLast year he was not invited to Christmas at my moms. When I asked what I\u2019ll say when people ask why he didn\u2019t come, he responded, \u201cthey won\u2019t ask.\u201d That led me to believe that she blabbed her big mouth to her whole side of the family about MY relationship. Why wouldn\u2019t they ask?! I was livid. I told her I didn\u2019t want to go because it made me feel uncomfortable. I felt like she was being childish for not being able to put their differences aside for one holiday. We argued for a while and she ultimately called me \u201cselfish\u201d and gaslit me into going. I was anxious and uncomfortable the whole time. I told her not to even ask me to come next year.\n\nI also did not go to my dads last year for the same reason. However, his side would ask where my husband was because my dad doesn\u2019t have a huge mouth. But my grandmother is starting to get suspicious about why we\u2019re never around together at dinners with my dad. My husband and I visit my grandmother separately now, and never together with my dad and his wife. And she is also prying about why I wasn\u2019t at thanksgiving. At this point I\u2019m sick of lying to my grandmother. I told my dad that next time she asked I was just gonna tell her I didn\u2019t go because my husband isn\u2019t invited. He BEGGED me not to tell her because it would upset her. So I guess he wants me to lie to her forever. \n\nI told both of my parents that he is my family whether they like it or not. \n\nNow it\u2019s almost Christmas again. I\u2019m already getting pressured into going on both sides but I\u2019m going to refuse. My husband has no family. His only family in the state (his dad and grandmother) both passed away recently. The holidays are very lonely for him. So on top of just not wanting to go for myself, I don\u2019t want to leave the person I love alone on Christmas. \n\nMy dad will be upset but respect my decision. My mom will crucify me for it and tell me how self-centered I am.\n\nAITAH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But as a parent, you can't force your daughter to get a divorce.  So even if you hate hubby (for good reason) it's not good form to invite daughter to family functions and specifically exclude daughter's husband.

Jail is what finally got me over the hump. By covering for him and not being honest about why he is not at family functions you are enabling him. They have Al-Anon meetings you should really go to.  It will help you ALOT. My best advice is to go tell the truth to the DA and have him step up and take responsibility for his criminal activity.  You should also set some boundaries.

And as this all sounds horrible, he has since gotten a lot of help for not only his substance abuse but also his PTSD.
