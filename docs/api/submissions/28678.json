If she wanted to learn that bad about learning to handle that hair type properly she'd go to beauty school, not harass you and bother you.\n\nShe SHOULD be embarrassed. Your hair isn't some novelty just because janice is opinionated and body boundaries are important so good on you for enforcing them. If you have said no over and over and over and she's obsessing over this it's harassment.\n\nYou are not a barbie doll, and her happiness is not your responsibility to cater to. You do not have to entertain her in the slightest and she needs to show you more respect.  \n\n\nJanice is being far too entitled about your hair, which pointedly, is not FOR HER, and does NOT BELONG TO HER. So it is not. her. decision. it's yours.", "NTA\n\nI'll have a war before I let someone touch my hair when I don't want them to. Has no one ever taught her boundaries? I don't care what she thinks; you have a right to not be touched if you don't want her to touch you I don't care what the reason is. Be it hair, hand, arms. Your body is your own.\n\nEdit: Let me reiterate that you **don't even need a reason.** Not wanting someone to touch your hair is **MORE** than enough of a reason.", "NTA.\n\nWhich part of \"No\" didn't she understand? The \"N\" or the \"O\"?\n\nShe sucks along with your brother.", "NTA, and it was long overdue. Is your brother always a racist jerk, or just about your hair?

Cause it sure doesn\u2019t sound like y\u2019all have the same kinda hair. Furthermore, since when does living in a diverse area somehow make you good at styling natural black hair?! It is completely different from other types of hair and, as you well know, requires an entirely different approach to styling so as not to damage it. \n\nPractically half my family were hairdressers and when I went to cosmetology school everyone told me not to let anyone there touch my hair. It was super thick, healthy, and long enough to almost sit on it. Did I listen? Absolutely not. Did I regret it? Almost immediately. Do NOT let her bully you into letting her do your hair!\n\nIdk what her major malfunction is or why she\u2019s so bent on styling your hair but YOU get to decide how you wear your hair and what makes you comfortable and happy. \n\nIf anyone in this situation set a bad example it was her and your brother in law. Keep those boundaries strong \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. You've said no multiple times, but she kept persisting.", "NTA\n\nThis is rude, racist and BS. Tell her to keep her hands out of your hair. Tell Janice\u2019s husband to step back and step off.", "NTA. Your hair is a part of your body and not one single person is entitled to your body or get a say in who can touch your body. Tell them to go pound sand.\n\nEdit: i keep thinking that your should also ask them what kind of example are they settings for their daughters. That it's ok for people to pester them after they have said \"no\"? So any boy who wants to have sex with them and the girls tell the boys no, the boys should just ignore it until the girls are pressured to say yes? The more i think about it, the more angry i get with your brother and SIL.", "NTA.  She sounds racist and boundary blind.  Next time ask her if she needs to go back to grade school to get a refresher on what \"No\" means.  Also I'm not surprised she's dumb enough to think the silent treatment is a punishment and not a reward.  Good job.
