A woman goes to visit her son and his roommate for dinner. While she's there she can't help but notice they're very comfortable with each other. She starts to suspect they're actually a couple, and toward the end of the night she pulls her son away and asks if they are a couple, reassuring him that she's fine with it if they are. He tells her that they are absolutely not a couple, just roommates.\n\nA few weeks pass, and they can't find their fry pan anywhere. In frustration the roommate asks if the mother could've taken it. He doesn't see why his mother would take his frypan, but he decides to send her a very carefully worded letter:\n\nDear Mom, he writes. I'm not saying you took the frypan. I'm not saying you didn't take the frypan. I'm just saying, we haven't seen it since you came to dinner.\n\nShe replies, Dear son, I'm not saying you and your roommate are a couple. I'm not saying you aren't a couple. I'm just saying, if you were sleeping in your own bed, you would've found the frypan by now.", "NTA and hope she hasn't thrown them out with the old take out containers.", "If she's ignoring your requests to stop stealing and hoarding your shit, and refuses to actually find and return it to you, you Would Not Be An Asshole to go and get your shit back. She's made it clear she doesn't give a fuck if you get your property back, if it inconveniences her in any way, so I'd take pictures of the absolute sty she is living in, find your property, and then turn the pictures in to the property manager once you're packed to move. Tell them you refuse to pay any fines or fees for the state she leaves her area in, otherwise she'll probably stick you with the cleanup fees afterwards. She seems pretty shitty, and I've had two roommates that behaved the same way.", "NTA to go in and see if it\u2019s there if you\u2019re packing up your stuff.
