I know they mean well but sometimes they are stuck in a time warp. I live kinda close by but really only visit them when my bf is able to go with me to relieve my stress. This happened years ago in the summer of 2019. I was 19 at the time and my brother was like 23-24. \n\nBasically my brother got absolutely hammered and my grandma and mom started on political talk. I really hate when any of this is discussed but they started on it. The two of them don\u2019t really say anything hateful but they are both more conservative. Now onto my brother. After his 5th or so Long Island iced tea he wanted to get involved. But his contribution was basically \u201call these fucking f*gs and \u201cn words\u201d stay in their line and stop ruining shit for the rest of us\u201d uh what else \u201cit makes my blood boil watching these \u201cn words\u201d acting like baboons\u201d oh and than he basically said hitler had the right idea with the wrong people. Edit: I forgot one of my favorite claims of his! \u201cPolice brutality is like natural selection because the people police kill aren\u2019t exactly model citizens\u201d. I attacked him and screamed my head off. While I don\u2019t have any black friends 2 of my best friends are gay so I took it personally. \n\nThe next morning my hungover brother apologized. Said he was just really drunk and didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. My grandma and mom thought this was perfectly fine. I said meh whatever just to keep the peace but I knew I didn\u2019t really think of him as a brother much after that. \n\nThat brings us to now. My family is planning a bday dinner for me (like we do every year) and the restaurant we are going to has a certain amount of spaces at the place. Because my grandparents, aunt uncle and cousins are coming, my bf is not coming because of the amount of space. This is when I told my mom straight up that I\u2019d rather have my bf there over my older brother. \n\nWe talked for awhile about this but i did end up telling my mom that the fight on vacation after his tirade really changed how I feel about him. Now my mom got mad at me. She said that: \n1.this was almost 4 years ago\n2. He apologized multiple times \n3. He hasn\u2019t done anything similar since (which as far as I know is actually true)\nAnd 4. He is my brother and my bf and I haven\u2019t been together very long\n\nI told my mom it still feels weird. Like literally my entire perception of him changed that day. My mom did end the convo by saying he made a mistake 4 years ago and I do need to stop holding this over his head.

NTA. That kind of thing absolutely does change how you feel about a person, often irreversibly. \"Drunk minds speak sober thoughts\". \n\nAlso, not enough spaces for your bf? I'm gonna say they did that on purpose seeing how many other people are going. I hate those kind of dinners, good luck!", "NTA.  Alcohol doesn't make you homophobic or racist.  \n\n  \nBut your mom and grandma think what he said was fine?  and that his apology was fine?  And they hold the same views, but you've decided they \"mean well\"?", "NTA \n\n\nBut people can change, and, as frustrating as it is, supporting people in the change is probably more beneficial to everyone than completely writing them off. If someone is racist/homophobic and wants to change, but everyone writes them off as \"once a racist, always a racist,\" they are going to find more acceptance with bigots. If people acknowledge their willingness to change, and they are accepted, they will be exposed to less bigoted ideas.\n\n\n\nSo, the big question is, has your brother just not gone on bigoted rants, or is he actually changing his opinion? As you said, your mom is \"conservative, \" so he was raised with those views. Is he acknowledging that it was wrong, not what/how he said it, but that the views were wrong? That there should be marriage equality. That POC have very different experiences and there is systemic racism. Etc.", "NTA. It is good stand up against racism and homophobia, and you aren\u2019t obligated to like your family members, even a sibling.\nIt is your birthday dinner you should be allowed to bring a guest if you want to. \nIdon\u2019t know if you can prevent your brother from coming without a lot of family issues, but I don\u2019t think you are in the wrong for being uncomfortable or for wanting people you like rather than dislike at your birthday.", "NTA. Funny how they don't see the issue. Unless he can prove that his views radically changed, there really is no point spending time with such people.", "NTA. As they say, drunk words are sober thoughts. What he said that day are his true feelings. It\u2019s within the realm of possibility that his views have evolved in the four years since, but I seriously doubt it.", "NTA\n\nThat's not a mistake\n\nHis mistake was that he said it all out loud.\n\nNow. People can change but I would want to see meaningful proof that he has.", "NTA. Dunk words are sober thoughts. No one who isn\u2019t racist, is going to say something racist, simple as that. It\u2019s not about when what was said, it\u2019s about who he is.", "NTA. You never have to forgive or get over racist or homophobic behavior. Maybe he hasn't done anything like this since, BUT maybe it's only because he's been more careful where/when/who he says that stuff to.", "NTA. But have you tried to have a conversation with your brother since his tirade? Maybe a good heart to heart where you can ask him questions as to why he said those things and what he has done since to prove that he is not a racist. Also, all these comments that drunk words are also sober thoughts is BS. Drunk words are drunk thoughts a lot of the time. I\u2019ve been blasted and called contacts in my phone to argue with them about imaginary things that never happened, etc. Again, not condoning his actions at all, but after 5 Long Island ice teas it could be hard for anyone to from coherent sentences and rational thought. \n\nTalk to your brother, really question him and if he defends any racist points, obviously cut him out. People make mistakes and we have to be able to forgive them if they truly change. Just my opinion though.", "I think it's okay for you to decide this was the last straw and you don't want to be around your brother anymore\n\nAs a recovering alcoholic I will take issue with some of these \"drunken actions are sober thoughts\" statements though. Booze changes all sorts of things about your thought process and more so if you're a problem drinker. It doesn't just \"unmute\" and release shit was already there, it can isolate, amplify and distort thoughts. By this logic it shouldn't be rape to have sex with someone who is extremely drunk but conscious because \"drunken thoughts are sober actions\" so obviously they wanted to have sex with that person sober and the booze just let that thought out. \n\nToo much booze (especially over years or decades) turns your thoughts into funhouse versions of themselves, and I for one think it's totally plausible your brother NEVER really believed those things.\n\nStill they're horrible things to say and it's totally your call if you can find it in yourself to forgive him.", "NTA - Only you can decide when he is changed, nobody else. Drunk words are often sober thoughts.", "Theres a saying 'A drunk man words are a sober man deepest thoughts'. Being drunk is no excuse to defend what you say.", "NTA.

They say a drunk mind speaks the sober truth.", "Eh it\u2019s been 4 years and that incident was the only time where he said that stuff right?

I personally believe people can change for the better. That starts with that person deciding to change. Idk if that's been your brother or not. Idk how \"well\" he's really apologized at that(as in proven that he's taken the time to actually research the issues of other groups of people. ), so I think it's fair to say the ball is in his court to prove to you that he's changed and ashamed of his past actions.

If there have been no signs of change aside from one simple apology and your mom/grandma being like \"forget about it, it was forever ago\" then that would lead me to believe they are all ok with being racist or homophobic.", "You said you physically assaulted him over words. YTA.", "I don't know about that.  You can verbally attack someone without screaming.  You can start to verbally attack someone and then have raise your voice to just scream at the person.  \n\n\nThat's what it sounds like....to you.  It would have been a good opportunity for you to ask for more info, rather than responding to every one of OP's responses assuming what it sounded like to you was automatically correct.", "Pretty much this", "Again they don\u2019t say racist things but they\u2019re also not exactly allies. Like they treat my brothers outburst as an \u201cannoyance\u201d rather than a serious issue. When they see videos of people protesting on the news, their response is always \u201cthose idiots should be at work\u201d", "Even if she did, you should punch racists and bigots every time you get the chance and never apologize. If it comes down to allowing their hatred or standing up to it, never let it be. All it takes for evil to win is for good people to do nothing.", "You're right. I could be wrong. If I replied to all of her responses, she must not have made many of them. I only remember making about three replies.", "I figured that was it!! I have a huge family so this type of thing is more normal for me than it might be for others but in almost 25 years I've sat out 4 events lmaoo we draw straws", "Yeah that's all very concerning and makes me believe that they are ok with the racism and homophobia but are smart enough to know they shouldn't be letting their son say it outwardly. Again, if your values don't align with people, even if they are family, you can choose to not be around them. People will show you who they truly are, you just have to believe them.", "Nope. I'll take a racist over a violent criminal who unabashedly justifies his violence any day of the week. You're lucky you're not from around my way, because some would give you something a bit more potent than a fist if you try that nonsense on them.", "Yeah everyone is nice usually but they will gossip about stuff like that. My older cousin dated 3 different guys in a span of like 5 years and she brought them all to family stuff. Always whispers like \u201coh another one\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t wait for the next one\u201d behind her back and I don\u2019t want to deal with that. It\u2019s almost like don\u2019t bring significant others to family events unless you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll marry them.", "I guess I\u2019ll play blissful ignorance with other family members who haven\u2019t gone on those kinda rants. Like if they aren\u2019t presenting the hate to me I\u2019m not going to ruin our relationship by digging to find it.", "Real tough guy over here, ooh im shaking in my boots. Amazing how you say violence is worse than racism - and then end your comment with a threat of violence.", "Spoken like a true racist.", "I can't fault you for that, finding out you don't agree with family members on basic issues is never easy. Just remember to believe people when they show you who they are, even when it's hard to believe. And also, it's your birthday, meaning it's YOUR day, racist relatives aside you do what you want on your birthday, that's the point.", "Yes. Violence is worse than racism. I'm not threatening anyone. I am factually pointing out that if the person I replied to escalates their objection to racism to the point of violence, many around my way will further escalate. How you read what I said as a threat is beyond me, especially when I am the one who objected to using violence against words.", "Not a racist. Just pointing out that if you escalate a situation against someone else over words, they're going to escalate it further against you and shut down the conversation more effectively.", "Lol username does not check out. Happy for you that you have your violent racist neighbors to protect you though, im sure you'll need it", "I think you should have a good long talk with your brother,one-on-one. See if that awful time really *was* an exception. See where he\u2019s coming from today. Society is not going to improve as a whole unless we allow people who are wrong to change and grow. It\u2019s been four years,maybe reconnecting with your big bro would be a good thing for both of you. You clearly overcame your conservative household,perhaps he\u2019s doing the same,or trying to. Having his sis in his corner would be a great help in that regard. \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA. Who\u2019s this birthday dinner for? Clearly it\u2019s not for you if you can\u2019t even invite your bf or choose who is not allowed to attend.\n\nI say skip the dinner and go out with your bf instead. They can\u2019t fit him in the reservation? Well, I guess you can\u2019t fit them then.", "NTA\n\nDrunk words are sober thoughts.", "NTA I spent a long time thinking about this. A lot of the time people never apologise, they dismiss your feelings and say you are over reacting and its no big deal and call you insensitive etc. They do not change and do not intend to change and commit similar incidents. He didn't say this outside of the family, it wasn't about you, or to you. It was a general racist/homophobic rant. It wasn't in front of a gay friend. I wouldn't forgive him if he had done it in front of one of your friends. He hasn't reoffended as far as you know for 4 years and he has apologised a lot. I think I would continue to give him side eye and you will probably never feel the same way about him ever again, but I would attend an event with him there and only refuse to see him again if he reoffended.", "NTA. His \u201cmistake\u201d? His mistake was saying out loud what he\u2019d been thinking to himself.", "NTA", "NTA and the reason she wants you to drop it is bc in a way she agrees. The people who enable the behaviour agree with it. I don\u2019t care how drunk he was or how many snot nosed apologies he gave", "Nta. Alcohol doesn\u2019t make you homophobic or racist.", "Apparently they don\u2019t think it is wrong given the reaction of your mother and grandmother when your brother was spewing out a very racist and homophobic speech.   \nLike he just justified it with \"I was drunk\" and they were okay with it. That\u2019s not an appropriate response.", "Alcohol loosens the tongue and inhibitions. It does not drastically alter who you are, it exposes it.\n\nNTA, not by a long shot. May he and Hitler be happy together. I would never be around my brother if he said something so vile.", "NTA", "this was too triggering to read. TW: for Black/gay folk. don't read", "That\u2019s weird, I\u2019ve never magically turned into a straight-up Nazi when I\u2019m drunk. \n\nNTA. I wouldn\u2019t want him there either.", "NTA.  Here is some unsolicited life advice.  If there is no room at the table for your relationship, there is no room for your personal growth.", "NTA. Alcohol only makes you feel less inhibition, it doesn't give you racist or homophobic views. \n\nCan I be your first black friend? You sound like an awesome ally.", "That's true yeah, maybe a reason not to cut him or or anything lol, but it would still be hard to be comfortable around him. Also yeah what the heck", "I guess. Side note, also always hated extended family birthdays lol... but that's just me.", "I guess yeah, I didn't really think about how long that might be or not be", "Ok, but if they say that, then they ARE saying racist things", "Wow that sucks. My dad\u2019s family loves the newbies; especially the tall ones (my aunts are short. Smallest is 4\u20199\u201d. my sister brought a tall guy to thanksgiving once whooboy did they worship him\u2026and asked him get things from tall shelves \ud83d\ude06) . \n\nOn the post definitely NTA. My brother and I don\u2019t  talk to my sister for something like this. Not racism or bigotry but because at one point, for different reasons mind you, she blasted us with speeches that caused us to see her in a new light. My brother hasn\u2019t talked to her in almost a decade. I\u2019m on year 3. \n\nShe\u2019s tried to apologise but her \u201capology\u201d is also another way to prove she\u2019s right. So we just decided we didn\u2019t need that kind of toxicity in our lives.\n\nI\u2019d agree with the others that what he said while drunk might be close to what he really feels. As drunk people tend to have really low inhibitions and loose lips on things they\u2019d normally keep quiet about.", "Well that's fair given the situation"]}
