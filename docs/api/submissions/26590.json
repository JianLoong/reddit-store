We have been together for 7 years and I've been the solo driver for all of these 7 years. Never once have I asked her to pay for fuel, insurance, upkeep or repairs. She's from a well off family and gets financial help from her parents while I have to work and pay for everything out of my own pocket since my parents can't afford to help me out.\n\nShe just finished her masters and started working her first job last week. Since there's no public transportation, I get up 2 hours before I regularly have to, and drive her to work, it's around 45 minutes each way. I had to change my insurance policy to include the extra distance driven and my rate has shot up by 70% due to this.\n\nI did extensive math to calculate the fuel consumption, extra maintenance costs and insurance costs and explained everything to her. We had a verbal agreement that she'd pay for 75% of monthly fuel costs (because my job is 80% home office and I only use the car for grocery shopping or trips together outside of that), 50% of the insurance costs, and 50% of any upcoming maintenance or repair costs. \n\nI believe that this is entirely reasonable because I never asked her for any money in the 7 years I drove her around, and because 80% of my car use from now will be getting her to work.\n\nThen, she went to her parents place to get some cash because I asked her to pay back the insurance, a tank of fuel, and some extra cash because inspection is due this month. She sent me a text to the tune of \"My parents are furious and won't pay for your car insurance\" and \"They said it's your car and clearly you offered to drive me to work\" aswell as \"So I'm sorry but I can only give you $ x.\"\n\nI replied with \"Well I don't understand it really, because A I didn't offer it, it was basically universally expected for me to do that, B you earn your own money now, so why don't YOU pay it out of your own pocket, and C, don't bother with paying for it, I don't want to get you in trouble or get myself in trouble with my in-laws to be, but don't come whining when we'll just spend the weekends at home because all of my spending money goes towards car expenses.\" She then called me an asshole and a gold digger via text and told me she'll be back for dinner to talk this out.\n\nTalk it out we did, and what I got from it is that she thinks it's unfair that she (psychologist in training) earns as much as I do (side job IT) while working more hours and that she believes she's entitled to a better living standard due to a more complex education, and that $250 in fuel and $70 in insurance each month would cut into her spending money. I told her that's tough luck but it's how the world works, and to stop complaining because in just a few years, she'll out-earn me by like 4x. She's still mad at me.

She believes that SHE should have a better lifestyle than you do because (in her mind) her education is more complex than your. It doesn't matter that the market decides what her compensation and yours are; she's going to make herself better off than you by making you shoulder HER expenses.\n2. She has an illness but she doesn't bother to figure out her own solution. She glommed onto you being the one to bear her bad fortune for her SEVEN years ago (when she was 17 and you were 19).\n3.

She now has the good fortune to continue receiving parental support AND a salary commensurate with yours, but she still feels that she needs to have you bear her burdens and she SHOULD be better even MORE at an advantage than you.\n4.

Yeah... just what I'm looking for in a partner! /s\n\nOP, you started dating her when you were pretty young. She was already good at making everyone do her bidding back then, and she's only gotten better at it. Look, there are disagreements a couple can talk through, work through and be stronger partners for it. That is not happening here. You would be so much better off by separating yourself from her and letting her stand on her own two feet. I think you would be better off looking for someone else to build a life with, but at least if you make her be responsible for herself, you have a chance to not constantly be told that it's your job to make her life easy, a chance to see her from a distance and see whether she is willing to be more responsible for herself.\n\nYou don't owe her a damn thing. You've already given her a buttload over the past seven years - none of which you owed her. Please, please, give yourself the space you need. You would not be leaving her over car expense payments; you would be leaving her over her being an entitled, selfish, not-caring-about you, taking-advantage-of-you kind of partner.

She should probably find a place to live closer to her job, unfortunately that will likely eat up most of her income, but she has parents to lean on. Your costs will reduce when you are no longer paying for food for two or paying for all activities for both of you. If it isn't obvious, you should break up with her.

That she went straight to \"gold digger\" is telling. When she's earning 4 times more than you, I guarantee that her money is still going to be her money and your money is going to be hers.\n\nFor a psychologist in training, it's sad that she's blind to so much of this. The two of you need to be in couple's counseling.", "NTA.  If her parents are so well off, they can pay for taxi/Uber or whatever.  It is absolutely not unreasonable or gold digging to expect to be reimbursed for an expense of this magnitude.  Not to mention the time commitment.

Just tell her you can\u2019t afford to do this anymore, so you won\u2019t and her parents will have to pay for her transportation starting next month or something.  It will surely cost them more, but, hey the money won\u2019t be going to you, so that\u2019s all fine right?  I also would consider if her parents are going to be an issue going forward.

It is her upbringing from her parents. Because they are enabling her behaviour and have the desire to use you this way.

Wow she really said that huh? It sounds like she doesn't consider you her equal and already looks down on you. \n\n\"called me an asshole and a gold digger\". That gold digger comment seals it.
