We have been together for 7 years and I've been the solo driver for all of these 7 years. Never once have I asked her to pay for fuel, insurance, upkeep or repairs. She's from a well off family and gets financial help from her parents while I have to work and pay for everything out of my own pocket since my parents can't afford to help me out.\n\nShe just finished her masters and started working her first job last week. Since there's no public transportation, I get up 2 hours before I regularly have to, and drive her to work, it's around 45 minutes each way. I had to change my insurance policy to include the extra distance driven and my rate has shot up by 70% due to this.\n\nI did extensive math to calculate the fuel consumption, extra maintenance costs and insurance costs and explained everything to her. We had a verbal agreement that she'd pay for 75% of monthly fuel costs (because my job is 80% home office and I only use the car for grocery shopping or trips together outside of that), 50% of the insurance costs, and 50% of any upcoming maintenance or repair costs. \n\nI believe that this is entirely reasonable because I never asked her for any money in the 7 years I drove her around, and because 80% of my car use from now will be getting her to work.\n\nThen, she went to her parents place to get some cash because I asked her to pay back the insurance, a tank of fuel, and some extra cash because inspection is due this month. She sent me a text to the tune of \"My parents are furious and won't pay for your car insurance\" and \"They said it's your car and clearly you offered to drive me to work\" aswell as \"So I'm sorry but I can only give you $ x.\"\n\nI replied with \"Well I don't understand it really, because A I didn't offer it, it was basically universally expected for me to do that, B you earn your own money now, so why don't YOU pay it out of your own pocket, and C, don't bother with paying for it, I don't want to get you in trouble or get myself in trouble with my in-laws to be, but don't come whining when we'll just spend the weekends at home because all of my spending money goes towards car expenses.\" She then called me an asshole and a gold digger via text and told me she'll be back for dinner to talk this out.\n\nTalk it out we did, and what I got from it is that she thinks it's unfair that she (psychologist in training) earns as much as I do (side job IT) while working more hours and that she believes she's entitled to a better living standard due to a more complex education, and that $250 in fuel and $70 in insurance each month would cut into her spending money. I told her that's tough luck but it's how the world works, and to stop complaining because in just a few years, she'll out-earn me by like 4x. She's still mad at me.

She believes that SHE should have a better lifestyle than you do because (in her mind) her education is more complex than your. It doesn't matter that the market decides what her compensation and yours are; she's going to make herself better off than you by making you shoulder HER expenses.\n2. She has an illness but she doesn't bother to figure out her own solution. She glommed onto you being the one to bear her bad fortune for her SEVEN years ago (when she was 17 and you were 19).\n3.

She now has the good fortune to continue receiving parental support AND a salary commensurate with yours, but she still feels that she needs to have you bear her burdens and she SHOULD be better even MORE at an advantage than you.\n4.

Yeah... just what I'm looking for in a partner! /s\n\nOP, you started dating her when you were pretty young. She was already good at making everyone do her bidding back then, and she's only gotten better at it. Look, there are disagreements a couple can talk through, work through and be stronger partners for it. That is not happening here. You would be so much better off by separating yourself from her and letting her stand on her own two feet. I think you would be better off looking for someone else to build a life with, but at least if you make her be responsible for herself, you have a chance to not constantly be told that it's your job to make her life easy, a chance to see her from a distance and see whether she is willing to be more responsible for herself.\n\nYou don't owe her a damn thing. You've already given her a buttload over the past seven years - none of which you owed her. Please, please, give yourself the space you need.

This is the real world guys, it\u2019s not black & white and people can actually talk with each other to solve things", "And it\u2019s 90 mins of driving TWICE a day, because I presume he\u2019s driving to pick her up as well as drop her off.", "Have you met the average psychologist?!!! Hahahaha.   \n\n\nA great many of them are incredibly entitled people with no insight into their own behaviours, and a sense of superiority or arrogance that can be breathtaking. Young people who can expect to do a six year master program BEFORE they can pull a salary, and then several years of low income\u2026 are not people who have had to live in the real world and pay their bills along the way.", "We're not in the US, and to become a psychotherapist, you need two years of practicing psychology in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nMost psychiatric hospitals do not want trainee psychologists, so the job to applicant ratio is like 1:25.

The difference is I pay them well, provide the car, fuel, insurance, tax, roadside assistance, valeting and anything else the car requires. OP sounds like he's doing all of that for his fianc\u00e9e but it's all coming out of his pocket. How she thinks this is fair I don't know \ud83e\udd14  OP you're fianc\u00e9e is being super entitled about this. Plus running to her parents even though she's working and can pay you herself? I mean come on. NTA OP.", "[removed]", "Probably because he feels like he can't stop driving her. How much BS will he get for stranding his disabled fiancee. So many people would take her side without hearing his and he would look like a monster", "Why did she take a job she can't get to?  He needs to just tell her 'sorry, I can't drive you to work anymore, I can't afford to pay x'.", "Exactly! A gold digger is someone who gets the benefit of a certain lifestyle while someone else pays for it (and chooses to be in the relationship for that reason).\n\nI\u2019m not saying she is a gold digger - she could be in the relationship for any number of reasons. But if there IS a gold digger here\u2026it\u2019s not him. She is expecting to get the benefits of a car AND driver while he pays for it\u2026how on earth could she call HIM a gold digger?", "For that last bit about her showing him who she is, to me the most damning thing is her thinking she \u201cdeserves\u201d a higher standard of living because her education was more \u201ccomplex\u201d. \n\nLike what? That\u2019s not how it works. Otherwise veterinarians would be ROLLING in the dough. \n\nThat\u2019s some elitist bullshit.", "It sounds like the selfishness and entitlement runs deep! She\u2019s getting a free ride to and from work everyday but thinks she doesn\u2019t need to contribute anything because she\u2019s now making just as much as him??", "They did talk and solve things and then the GF went back on the agreement after her dad intervened. This is a big red flag for a seven year relationship.", "I mean she has clearly shown a pretty strong elitist streak (thinking she deserves more money because of her education being more \u201ccomplex\u201d). That\u2019s a character flaw that usually runs DEEP. \n\nAlso she doesn\u2019t seem to respect OP much. You can\u2019t talk someone into respecting you. \n\nThey could keep talking this out until they\u2019re both blue in the face but if she always runs back to her parents, who seem to fuel this elitism and disrespect, it won\u2019t ever get better. \n\nSo why waste another 7 years.", "Because sometimes the scenario reveals deep character flaws that are so fundamental and heinous that they cannot possibly be a good partner no matter what else they bring to the table and cannot be fixed by a couple of serious chats", "It\u2019s said the most psych professionals go into it to find out what\u2019s wrong with themselves!  It\u2019s also the career with one of the highest suicide rates, most likely because many of them succeed!", "Oh you're the first wife/husband of a doctor. You exist to get them through school/training and then they ditch you.", "That's fine, but she needs to be responsible for her own transportation. And you shouldn't give up your fun spending to get her there. \n\nSo NTA (the agreement you originally proposed was more than fair and VERY kind) but if she's not going to contribute, just don't take her. Let her know today so she can make arrangements to get there another day.", "She can move closer to work or let her parents drive her.  What do you see in such an immature woman.", "That makes sense. It's also reasonable for her to expect you, as her fianc\u00e9, to drive her to work. What is concerning to me is that you can't work out the financial aspects of your situation as a unit. Half the car expenses plus slightly more for gas seems fairly standard for a married couple. While your response seemed a little snippy (\"don't bother paying for it but don't whine to me\"), overall, NTA, and I think she should consider the extra $320 a month a fair expense for the job of her dreams. If she were able to drive then she would be spending much more on her own car.", "You\u2019re being used and will be discarded once you\u2019re no longer useful.\n\nWhen that happens, don\u2019t say the rando assholes of reddit didn\u2019t warn you!", "Yea and she's calling him the gold digger\ud83e\udd23 like my man hasn't asked her to pay for even a tank of fuel all the years they've been together and now she's getting mad that she's gotta help pay to upkeep their mode of transportation.", "Maybe the fianc\u00e9/her parents should buy her a car, pay for the insurance, maintenance and gas and OP uses it to transport fianc\u00e9 around.", "Not sure she is going to be much of a psychologist with her attitude.\n\nNTA", "The gold digger and asshole name calling pushes this beyond acceptable discussion and is essentially emotional and verbal abuse. I think he will regret it if he stays with her.", "I would 100% hire a driver to shuttle me and my 6 kids around to their activities. I\u2019m so tired of driving. \n\nThe problem is that when you have 6 kids you can\u2019t afford to hire anything out bc the kids you need employees for take all the money you\u2019d pay those employees. ;)", "Heard a lot of stories heading this way and it's almost always doctors lol. Anecdotal but still.", "yup how many stories have we seen on tiktok and reddit of women who So supported them and when they the woman got up they left the partners behind", "This! My friend ended up in exactly the same situation. Supported his doctor ex-wife all through her schooling and supported her financially, and she ditched him immediately after she finished so she could marry her affair partner. Now she structures her income so she has to pay minimal child support despite making WAY more than he does, and she neglects their child.", "This, if she doesn't even appreciate him now, she will never stay once she is finished with school.", "Why is it OP's responsibility to spend a three hours every day driving their partner to work?  What does the partner do for the couple that takes three hours a day (and costs $320 a month)?\n\nAnd, if it's share and share alike, what's gonna happen in a few years when OP's is finally bringing in the bucks?  \"Oh, no, you should've gone to graduate school like me and made sacrifices in order to earn more!\"  (Neatly ignoring the sacrifices that OP is already making.)\n\nI hate the way that Reddit always suggests breaking up, but it's certainly important to iron this out before getting married.", "I'm aware that my reply might have been a little aggressive. I was just really pissed that we clearly laid out what the cost would be, she agreed, and then pulls a sorry on it.", "That's why I don't understand...how she could go for 7 years and never offer to contribute?! Granted, she doesn't own a car, but it doesn't take a wizard to understand the costs involved. \n\nNow it's not only increased costs, but vastly increased time and she's getting all mad and running to her folks? Sorry, but the train has left the station and she's not on board. She or her folks can figure out transportation.", "I think this is the best non-nuclear solution. The family retains ownership of the car, they can get monitored insurance (I don't know what other companies have but mine has a program that monitors speed, phone use, breaking etc and offers a discount based on your driving). Can supply him with a gas card. OP is already doing a lot driving her out of love.", "It'd certainly be better than what's happening now. Although the fianc\u00e9e sounds like she'd never stop reminding him that it's \"her\" car and she can do what she wants with it.", "Looking at psychology as a whole, I would say it's a requirement to be batshit crazy to be a psychologist.", "Absolutely. She's also demanding that he spend 3 hours of his day driving her without a word of thanks or willingness to contribute. And HE's the golddigger? Unbelievable.", "Oh lord, 6 kids, you definitely have my admiration. I loved the thought of more kids, but lacked the patience I'm afraid. I had 2 because I wanted each of them to have a sibling, that was enough for me lol.", "It was very common for a wife to support her husband while he was getting his higher degrees and starting out on his career, then he'd find a younger mistress and leave the wife hanging.", "This just happened to my good friend. He worked his ass off while she went to school and didn't ask her to work or pay for anything for years, he fully supported her and paid for her school. They got married July '22 just before she graduated,and she pretty quickly got a really good, well-paying job. By the time their 1-year anniversary rolled around this summer, she'd moved to another state, was living with another man, and had filed for divorce. No offer to compensate him for all the time and money he'd invested in her, in good faith that it would eventually pay off in a good life with a loyal loving wife and family.", "My step mother was a medical receptionist and then ran a dept at a hospital. I've met one doctor still with their first spouse.", "Does people that find that reasonable not sleep. Three hours is alot of time.", "Not aggressive at all!  Just the facts.  Don\u2019t let her put this all on you for being \u201caggressive.\u201d  That\u2019s just a tactic she\u2019s using to avoid her responsibilities.", "Then why you standing for it & not following people\u2019s advise here to tell her to make her OWN way to work each day?! If she feels entitled to certain quality of life, then she can pay for ubers each morning. Your fiance has been using you for the longest time & you seem like a sucker, sorry! You cant be pissed & not do anything about it. Youre wasting 3 hours a day driving her to & from work like shes your child & she pulls this shit on you? Please update us when you stop being a doormat & tell her to make her own way to work like the big girl she is.", "Put it clearly in writing what the 'new' expenses would be, send it to her and her parents, and let them know the options are either a) her paying her share of the expenses or b) she gets an Uber account, either paid by her or by them.  It's not as though you're charging her for the additional time it'll take you trailing back and forth. \n\nNTA, obviously, but her reaction is super-entitled.", "She agreed because she assumed someone else, her parents, would actually be paying for it. Her tune changed real fast when she learned it would be her own expense. If she'd known that from the beginning, I guarantee she wouldn't have agreed.\n\nShe wants an easy life at someone else's financial expense. Don't let her make it yours.", "He's chauferring her for 3 hours (!!!) a day!", "Exactly! She doesn't even have to pay 50%, I don't think, but paying for a couple tanks of fuel a year, and maybe some maintenance, would probably have avoided all of this.", "Well, she could do what she wants with it, but only if she's gonna drive it. If he doesn't feel like driving her somewhere he isn't required to. She might have to find someone else to drive her then.", "It kinda just\u2026 happened. Like obviously not but I looked around once and I asked my husband \u201c*how did this happen?*\u201d and he looked just as confused as I felt. \n\nI love my big family. There\u2019s so many pros. But I absolutely respect ppl who decide it\u2019s not for them. Some nights I think it\u2019s not for me, too. ;)", "You may have been slightly snippy but she is delusional. I am concerned that she thinks her education and chances puts her in a position where she deserves to earn more and more importantly have more \"fun money\" than you do. I can see that pattern repeating. Most people want to earn more money because it helps their family unit not so they can use it for themselves. Think seriously if you want to be paying all the important bills while she reserves most of her doctor's salary for fun stuff and tells you it is because you didn't study or improve yourself enough. And she's counting her chickens before they hatch - she's not turned that education into gold yet.", "this should be higher up!! its not only the cost in money, but also a lot of his time goes to chauffeur her. come on, i would not get up 2hrs earlier to drive anyone anywhere everyday. not even if i get paid."]}
