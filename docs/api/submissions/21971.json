NTA. in fact you were a hell of a lot more polite than i would\u2019ve been in my response to them. what you said wasn\u2019t even that rude it was a literal fact. this is why entitled people stay entitled because people around them have that stupid mentality of \u201cjust leave it alone\u201d people need to be put in their place every once and a while.", "Does anyone else remember Body on Tap shampoo that had real beer in it?
