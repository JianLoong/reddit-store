Your neighbor confronted you with something that's absolutely none of her business. THAT is super-rude. Your rude response shut her up. Good. There's no earthly reason why you should apologize.

This doesn't even take into account any guests that may have one or two. This is also going with literally saying the couple of weeks is on two weeks. To me, \"a couple of weeks\" can mean between two to four weeks, so it's possible it is even less than that per day."]}
