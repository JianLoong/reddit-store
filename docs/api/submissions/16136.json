Get married. If his family is coming from overseas, then you can't really cancel it anyway. I think a smaller religious ceremony with your mom present is a great idea. You might want to do it sooner rather than later. Cancer is unpredictable. You could have a ceremony before she starts treatment, and then a larger full wedding as scheduled in a month. Good luck.", "INFO: Just how \"against your relationship\" *is* your mother? The fact that your family is demanding that you postpone your wedding instead of your mother wanting to be there while she can to support you is a big marinara flag, in my opinion, as is calling you names for not wanting to postpone last-minute. Within one month is very short notice for postponing a wedding, and you will likely lose out on a lot of deposit funds.\n\nFollow-up question: have you seen actual confirmation of your mother's diagnosis? Don't take this the wrong way, and maybe I've been on this sub for too long, but I've seen a lot of parents here and on r/raisedbynarcissists that aren't above faking a critical illness to sabotage a relationship and marriage that they don't approve of.", "NTA. Get married and enjoy it as much as you can. This may sound harsh but there may never be a time that suits your mother.", "There will be never the right time for your mother. She doesn't want you married, cancer or not. Just elope and pl\u00e1n second ceremony for the family that shows support and exlude the relatives who disagreee", "Nta. Postpone the religious ceremony for your family until they can join in. But get married your life can't Stop because someone else is sick. And whereas I'm sure everyone hopes she goes into full remission. This may be the only chance your mother has to see you get married.", "NTA. As someone who's lost their mom to stage 3 cancer, you don't postpone or cancel things. You want your mom present for as many things possible. When my mom got diagnosed, we went to travel the world. From Alaska to Paris. We have so many memories, and it's so nice to look back and enjoy them.\n\nIf they(your mom and family) don't want to be their that is on them and tbh, if enough of them don't want to go and if you'd be ok with it, I'd cancel your side of the wedding and just do the one for you fiance, and hopefully get some money back.", "Mom's behaviour toward your fiancee aside, NAH. \n\nLike you said, cancer is extremely unpredictable and if she gets into treatment quickly, her induction period (when she first starts chemotherapy drugs) can be rough. When my mom when through her's I couldn't have imagined her being able to attend anything or be on video call. \n\nI think your best bet is cancelling your portion of the ceremony -- if you really want your mom to attend, with the expectation that your fiancee's family likely will not attend that ceremony.", "NTA-do your fianc\u00e9\u2019s side wedding and postpone your sided.", "NTA. What a terrible situation to find yourself in. It is not at all selfish to not want to postpone the wedding, I think most parents in this situation would want the wedding to go on and take the day to be optimistic and celebrate. I think it has a lot to do with them not being on board with the marriage.\n\nOne way to go is to do the official/religious ceremonies and get legally married while everyone is present and tone down the partying. If you already have a venue, you can cancel the music and turn into a fancy dinner.", "What's the alternative? You have to move on with your life.\n\nNTA.\n\nGood luck and congrats.", "NTA. It\u2019s an unfortunate situation but life still moves on. You have to make difficult choices but making them out of feeling guilty or browbeaten by family certainly doesn\u2019t make for a happy milestone celebration. \n\nDo what you feel is best for yoh and be as supportive as possible for your family but if you are made to feel like you have to make a choice, then make one. But just be certain that you can live with the decision because you won\u2019t be able to go back and change the outcome later.", "NTA. If there is anything life teaches us is that life is unpredictable, and if there is any time to have a wedding, it's when the ones you love have a chance to be there. Your mom might not have that chance by postponing the wedding. \n\nYes, there is a possibility that she might get better, but there is also the possibility that she might not get better. If she does get better it can still take a very long time, so that might mean postponing the wedding for years. It sounds like your family is trying to prevent the wedding, because they still do not approve.", "NTA. Get married. Use your fianc\u00e9\u2019s side of the ceremonies. I wouldn\u2019t even do your side if you don\u2019t want to since your family isn\u2019t respectful to you, why bother showing them one iota of respect with a ceremony?\n\nCongrats on the upcoming nuptials and enjoy your life.", "Try preponing it.if possible. Once treatments start, it will be even more difficult", "Yeah, i don't know. Its tough.  There are no good options. I would ask my mom what she wants and proceed with that i guess as i couldn't celebrate while she is that ill, not sure if your are TA if you still can.   \nINFO: Why are they against the relationship? Is the wedding in the near future? Are you close with your family?", "This is a tough one. I don't think this is a situation of anyone being an AH - so many feelings here, and coming from someone who's Dad has been battling cancer since 2013, I get where you're coming from. It's unpredictable in so many ways - and you don't know if her being in a better place will happen in a year or five years or, unfortunately, never. \n\nSince they're talking about going to the wedding, I'm guessing they're slightly more on board with the relationship than they were when it first started, so that's good progress, but I can see how that history is hard for you.\n\nI think it's respectful to alter the plans to be closer to home to eliminate travel, and to perhaps push the date slightly once you know the treatment schedule. If she's not actively doing chemo or radiation, or recovering from surgery, then she will likely feel up to going if it's close enough to home. I would work on a date once you have that information and let them know that you'll move locations as a compromise, but I wouldn't push it indefinitely. It's fair that you want to get married in your religious service within a certain time frame. \n\nNAH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I hate to think anyone would stoop so low but I've read some crazy shit on JNMOM, how much was/is your mum against your relationship? Would she fake a cancer diagnosis to get you to postpone it?", "NTA You ARE postponing the event your mom was always going to attend (although I agree with others saying postponing is not a logical strategy in response to a cancer diagnosis - you would expect requests to move things up). There's no reason to postpone the ceremony that was always intended to be for others to attend.", "Sorry about your mom\u2019s diagnosis! But get married, at least keep the finance\u2019s family ceremony especially because these people have already planned/scheduled/paid to be there   \n\nWhat does your fianc\u00e9 say?", "NTA.  Go for it.  Cancer is terrible but the real disruptive factor here is the attitude of your mom and family towards your relationship.  So, I agree with others that you should at least do your fiance's ceremony as scheduled and your folks can either attend or watch it via video call, take it or leave it.  Separately, you can figure out however you want to celebrate with your family's side whenever.  But please go ahead and get married as planned.", "NTA. The wedding is soon, and god willing your mom will be able to stand up and walk around because her treatment just started.\n\nSerious cancer treatment will likely leave her sick and bald. I doubt she\u2019ll want to attend a wedding until most of her hair grows back. Even a cancer that responds well to treatment puts your wedding out at least 2 years, if not longer.", "NTA, figure out a way to combine the religious ceremonies, maybe incorporate parts from both. That ways both families can be present and if and when things take a turn for the worse with your mom, you guys will be able to focus on that instead of entertaining during grieving.", "NTA. I think your plan of postponing the ceremony for your side of the family and moving it to be closer to them is a great compromise. Your wedding less than a month away, which means that much of your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family has probably already booked/paid for their travel and you have probably already paid for a decent amount of the wedding. \n\nAs hard as it is right now, cancer treatment and recovery are a long road. If you postpone both ceremonies, there is no telling how long that postponement might last.", "NTA I think the idea of postponing just one of the ceremonies is nice.", "Wow that is real AF and I don't think social media options can help you find the correct answer. Do u feel like an asshole if you proceed? This is one of the harder ones to even try to give advise on. Try to include your mother so you don't feel regret for the rest of your life is all I can say. Wow you are in a for real tough situation here. Best of luck to all of you", "That's what I was thinking. Postponing is the OPPOSITE of what you do when someone has cancer.", "I'm glad somebody said it. I've had multiple people in my family fake cancer to try to manipulate others, so it's important to have direct confirmation of the diagnosis.", "Yes I have. It's definitely real unfortunately", "I will definitely not be able to enjoy but I am just trying to keep in mind both sides. Since my fianc\u00e9s family are specifically traveling for the wedding and postponing everything will mean they might not be able to attend later. That's why I was thinking the compromise might be to do the ceremonies separately. \n\nWhy are they against the relationship?- They don't like the fact that my fianc\u00e9 isn't a doctor/engineer, etc. And feel that he is not \"good enough\" for me\n\nIs the wedding in the near future? -yes, the wedding is scheduled for the end of this month (May 2023) \n\nAre you close with your family? -I am not super super close but there is a lit of cultural expectation to be respectful of their opinions and not question norms etc.", "No the diagnosis is definitely real.

NONE.  \n\nYou already have plans, and you need to go forward with the plans.  \n\nUnless your mother is in the hospital recovering from emergency surgery, if she is anything like me, she will be at your wedding.  \n\nHave the wedding.  Make the memories.  DO the THINGS.  All the THINGS.  \n\nDon't put off your wedding due to a cancer diagnosis.  Just do what you can to make it so that your mother can participate.", "As upsetting as the thought is, I would explain to your mum that if anything you would want the wedding to happen ASAP so she is more likely to be there. She might find that difficult to hear, but postponing and risking her dying before the rescheduled ceremony is something you'd want to avoid.", "NTA- have your wedding now because(i am very sorry to say this)there might not be a later. My husband's grandmother was diagnosed with cancer was given six months to live and passed away two weeks into treatment. I am not saying this to be cruel or scare you but if you want your mom part of your wedding do the small ceremony near her now please. Also, my bff's mom had stage 4 lymphoma and beat it and has been in remission now for over 10 years. Cancer can go either way. Congratulations on your wedding.  I pray your mother will recover and be in good health.", "I'm sorry for your Mum's cancer diagnosis. Sounds unfair to your in-laws to cancel your your fianc\u00e9 religious/cultural ceremony. Emotionally accept your family are unlikely to attend that ceremony or understand you not cancelling it. And then if your Mum wants to be present, have a small ceremony in her state in your religion for your family. If your Mum would prefer you to delay the wedding - understanding that with cancer that might mean she misses it - than you do that. If truthfully your Mum doesn't care about attending your wedding ceremony due to her feelings about your fianc\u00e9, than you can decided whether to press ahead with your planned religious ceremony, rearrange, or cancel your ceremony altogether and just have your fianc\u00e9 religious ceremony as your only wedding. NTA", "NTA. its hard for anyone in your family just having received the news about your moms cancer diagnosis but this diagnosis is exactly why you dont postpone your wedding.\nyour life cannot stop and it maybe the only time your mom may be able to attend. youll be happy to have the memory of her being there. you dont know what the further test results will show but stage 3 sounds severe enough to be together, celebrate life, share big moments and create memories.\nget married, its the best you can do for everyone involved, including your fiance, his family, your family, yourself and even your mom.", "NTA.  Get married now.  If you live in NA chances are excellent she will not have surgery this month.  Even if her treatments start, she will be less sick and sick looking this month than she will be for a long long time.  And if you postpone and goodness forbid she doesn't make it?  Do the wedding.  If you want her there this is your only guarantee.", "No time is going to feel like the right time OP. And treatment can take an undetermined amount of time until she\u2019s well. \n\nNTA. Have the wedding", "Get married.  My future FIL died unexpectedly one month before my wedding.  My future MIL said that we should go ahead with the wedding anyways. TBH, I was kind of shocked. It never once occurred to me that the wedding would be postponed.  I wante to be MARRIED.  The wedding itself was nice, but I wanted to move on with my life with my husband.  40 years later, I still want to be married to him.  Get married.", ">One option is to postpone the ceremony for my side of religion until mom is better hopefully so she can be a part of it and move forward with my fiances side since so much of his family is traveling from overseas. If we postpone then my fiance's family might not be able to travel again and be present.\n\nDo that. You have already agreed to two weddings. You don't need to put off the wedding for your spouse's side because of your mom. A wedding will be one? Or maybe a week, depending on what culture this is, but she can work out being there or not. Your future husband also has family. NTA. Normally this is when you try to hurry a wedding, not delay it.", "This. Definitely depends on the kind of cancer and if it\u2019s metastasized to lymph nodes, which she\u2019ll find out with more testing. That said, how likely is it that she\u2019ll begin induction chemo within the next month? If it\u2019s not already scheduled before the wedding, now is the BEST time for you to have it, as this is likely the best she will feel for a few years."]}
