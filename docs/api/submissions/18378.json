Assuming she caught her phone right away like any normal person would and didn't let it soak in the pool- you sit it out to dry for a while and usually it'll work. Even if it is fully broken, not your problem. Don't bring your phone to a huge body of water and not expect it to get wet.

You can even do underwater photography, if you wish.", "Not really.  90% of cell phones really hate water.  But 10% have high IP ratings (you can drop them in water), and they typically don't cost any extra.  Only \"catch\" is that they tend to be heavier and thicker.  \n\nIf you spend a lot of time in the pool, it's a no-brainer to buy a cell phone that can get wet and all that happens is....the screen gets washed.

She's ridiculous to not expect to get wet in a pool.  \n\nI used to work at a boat rental company and once had a customer ask whether if it was really windy, would he get wet? Oh please.

Floating in a pool by yourself with your phone is different than at a party. I would never risk it even by myself, but some people trust themselves.

It was dark and it got pushed off by accident while we were setting off fireworks in maine. It survived down there, wedged between some rocks for 8 hours before the tide was low enough to rescue it.
