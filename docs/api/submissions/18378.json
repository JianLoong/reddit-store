It's not like you purposely spiked her phone into a woodchipper.", "NTA", "NTA. Her phone probably still works, most modern phones are water resistant to some degree. Assuming she caught her phone right away like any normal person would and didn't let it soak in the pool- you sit it out to dry for a while and usually it'll work. Even if it is fully broken, not your problem. Don't bring your phone to a huge body of water and not expect it to get wet. They literally make cases for that- you'd think she would at least plan ahead.\n\nAlso a whole new phone? Even if you were in the wrong you shouldn't have to pay for her free upgrade. You'd pay for repairs to get it working again.", "NTA - ya shoulda done a sick cannonball or a wicked jackknife and busted water all over her for being such a dumbass", "NTA\n\nWhat fool takes their phone in the water at a pool party?

You can even do underwater photography, if you wish.", "Not really.  90% of cell phones really hate water.  But 10% have high IP ratings (you can drop them in water), and they typically don't cost any extra.  Only \"catch\" is that they tend to be heavier and thicker.  \n\nIf you spend a lot of time in the pool, it's a no-brainer to buy a cell phone that can get wet and all that happens is....the screen gets washed.

What exactly is your problem with that?\n\nDo you like it when people bump into you?", "I wouldn't be slinging the word dramatic around after your previous comment.", "That wasn't a dramatic statement. A dramatic statement would be \"oh my god if you're at a pool party you're going to drown!!!\"\n\nImplying that you're an idiot for acting like water works differently at a pool party than at a public pool is not being dramatic.\n\nSee the difference?"]}
