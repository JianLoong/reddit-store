With a mysterious look on your face.", "Yta i think you\u2019re being weird and paranoid, plus if she\u2019s your ex and it is fucking you up so badly that once a year she ask about your parents then maybe stop spending holidays with her", "She is otherwise a good friend. Her husband is a cool dude, and my girlfriend enjoys their company as well.", "He's estranged from his parents.", "YTA. Listen, you and her dated, she met your parents a handful of times. Now, years and years later, you see her on occasion and her point of reference is this time period when you dated and so she asks politely about your parents (which is quite normal to do). Perhaps the estrangement is big to you but is she aware of this? Next time she asks just very politely let her know that you are estranged from your parents and that you don't wish to talk about them. Then move on. If she keeps going you can further escalate but for now I think you may be blowing it out of proportion.", "Wait\u2026. If you dated 7 years ago how did she meet them ever if you\u2019ve been estranged 20 years?", "With how OP dropped that in like it's barely worth mentioning, does she even know that? I mean a solid \"How are my parents? I've been estranged from them for 20 years and haven't talked to them!\" would end that conversation for anyone with a lick of social sense. Has OP ever said that instead of the weird \"Why are you obessed with my parents??\" response?", "Just shrug say \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re asking since as you know, I don\u2019t speak to them.\u201d End of discussion. This doesn\u2019t have to be a big deal.", "Yes. But as you can see - he has edited it to say that. Five hours ago when I read this it was not", "Agreed, this is a great honest convo ending response. Can\u2019t imagine her asking again after hearing this in front of others a couple times if that", "Janet and I dated for 7 years.\n\nThen we broke up around 15 years ago.\n\nShe met them a few times in the first couple of years we were together.\n\nI'd already been avoiding my parents hard by that point. Haven't done a Christmas with them since the 90s, that kind of thing.", "You're lying about the estrangement, then. That is such OBVIOUSLY important information. YTA.", "Original post still says that she's aware of why his relationship with his parents makes that a weird question. The further details that he's estranged are useful but not essential.", "Honestly sometimes context is almost invisible to the poster and they don't realise that the situation itself is only weird or bad because of something that is actually external to the situation. Granted, this seems like a pretty obvious omission to make, but I've seen a lot of posts where the edited context suddenly takes it from a very clear \"Y T A\" to \"Wow OP please leave the house immediately with your birth certificate and don't look back because you significant other might actually murder you\".", "Op did and edit that they knew each other for 15 years and he haven't met he's parents in 20 years so she rubbing it in he's face", "Aye but it didnt say estranged. I mean loads of us have weird and dysfunctional relationships with our parents but people that have known us for years still ask. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly known in my circle for my great relationship with my mum but folk I\u2019ve grown up with still ask about her. It\u2019s up to me if I decide to say \u2018aye fine\u2019 and leave it at that or go \u201cfucking halfwits done it again!! If she thinks she\u2019s staying at mine this time she can fuck off and be homeless!!\u201d"]}
