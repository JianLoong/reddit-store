It doesn't even sound like she was anything more than serious and concerned about you, even if you didn't agree with the concerns. It sounds like she was trying to give you advice from a place of love that you just didn't like.\n\nDo you normally shut people out if they disagree with your opinions or actions? Maybe this is a one-off event because of how seriously you feel about it, but you should consider your past and think about whether or not it is. As a married woman in the future, it will not be an option to just shut out your husband like that. I mean, I guess it would be, as long as you were ok with getting divorced about the issue, too.

YTA\n\nEdited to add that the reason people wait until later in their relationships to get married is not always because they're not sure they love each other enough to commit. It's very often so that they can get a fuller view of each other as people. After six months, how many arguments have you had? Do you know how each other handles conflict? What about a life-altering situation like the death of a family member or a serious illness? Have you had to make any major decisions together about money, where to live, etc?

The worst thing to do is rush into it. So whats the rush? You can be fully committed with a ring and don't need to be legally married.

But you should also know enough to not rush into something until you fully get to know this person through life experiences\n\nIs it possible this relationship is the real deal? Sure.

Caveat: this is an anonymous post on Reddit. No one knows you or your family or your relationship. \n\nHere are the red flags I see in your post:\n\n1. That's a considerable age gap which can change the dynamic in a relationship. This can be fine especially if both are emotionally mature individuals.\n\n2. The relationship is being rushed forward without time to mature naturally. At 6 months, no matter how happy you are, you've not experienced enough challenges to see if you work together as a couple.\n\n3. Since the older partner is encouraging the rush- or going along with it- that is a huge red flag. Classic love bombing behavior. He should be trying to build relationships with you, your family, and your friends. \n\n4. A family member raises concerns and you are unable to have a reasonable discussion with them. Instead, you willing cut them out of your life rather than hear their concerns. This gives you something to bond with your partner over. See #5.\n\n5. you're bonding with your partner over severing ties to your family.\n\n6. The older partner encourages or at the least goes along with you severing ties with family members. You may be a very young, romantic 24 yo woman who thinks she's found her soul mate. But a 30 yo knows better and that makes this the biggest red flag of all. \n\nThis is tactical. This is isolating you from people who make you their priority, tell you what you need to hear when you need to hear it, even when it's hard. \n\nFrankly, this kind of behavior is notorious among abusers. Remember, abuse doesn't only mean he hits you.\n\nLook out for:\n\"No one understands you like I do\"\nGaslighting\n\"If you really love me, you will/woul...\"", "NTA. \nI do not understand what the fuck is going on in this thread.

I experienced this at my own wedding and indeed had to uninvited people who were very close to me. \nIf your sister doesn\u2019t want to celebrate your love, then she is not required or entitled to attend your wedding _which is a celebration of your love_. Everyone commenting otherwise here is stuck in an echo chamber for some weird reason.", "As much as it pains me to write it: NAH. \n\nYou are not an AH for being terribly naive. Also technically you are not wrong for not wanting someone at your wedding that doesn\u2019t suppose your marriage - although excluding your sister without any further discussion is a bit of an AH move but given the naivety of your entire post and writing style (see comment: \u201cwe will of course be madly in love in a year\u201d) whatever.\n\nYour sister is right to be concerned.

On another note congratulations on your upcoming wedding! I understand what you are going through. I met my husband in August of 2006 we started dating in September, he asked me to marry him in November. We were married by February of 2007. We have an amazing relationship and have been married for almost 16 wonderful years and I wouldn\u2019t have done anything different. As long as you have talked about everything you expect from each other it ahead of time, can be done. We agreed on what we wanted from our careers, how many children we wanted, future goals, money management and we received premarital counseling to make sure we didn\u2019t forget something important. If you follow all the steps and iron out any of the important issues ahead of time it can work.\n\nETA~ some one above said love is work not a feeling and she is correct! The feelings you have will be fleeting. It\u2019s a moment in time. I still stand by what I said about it working if you approach it correctly. I would not jump into a relationship like I have (and are talking about) based on feelings alone. We worked hard to iron out major decisions ahead of time to make sure we were going into it with our feet on the ground even if our heads were in the clouds. \n\nAlso I never gave my verdict\u2026 ESH. I don\u2019t think you or you sister are necessarily an AH for this. I think your sister has your best interest at heart and while I understand being frustrated, I think you should talk to her and hear her out.

I do understand where she is coming from, and honestly would not react much differently towards my own siblings at this point. For multiple reasons - some of which to be fair are my guessing based on the amount of time, so may be nonexistent. \n\n1. Have you had your first big fight yet? A lot of people don't have a serious disagreement until after the honeymoon stage. Seeing how both of you react in that moment is super important to a relationship.\n\n2. You're still in the honeymoon phase. Have you discussed what will happen when the butterflies fade, are you positive you both will put work into continuing it, or will ine or both of you decide the other just isn't the one anymore and either cheat or leave? The butterfly stage can last for several years (and yes some people never leave it, but it's rare assuming you won't is a recipe for disaster). A lot of relationships end after this stage because it suddenly becomes work and for some people they feel the feelings are gone.\n\n3. Have you made it to all of the major discussions. Money. Children. How children will be raised. Where you'll live. If you're willing to move. Jobs. Chores. Money again because there are sooo many angles to look at things with money. Pets. Religion. Politics. Some of this is talked about early, some of which people often don't think to talk about until much further into the relationship- and there are so many other things that are probably better talked about as well!!!\n\nI dont think your sister went about it correctly- and I'm in no way telling you not to get married.

But her bringing this up doesn't sound like she was doing it to be petty or bratty. Bur because she loves you and wants what is best for you. That is something everyone needs in life.
