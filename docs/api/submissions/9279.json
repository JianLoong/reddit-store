I wouldn't say you're too young to be getting married, but it is very fast unless you're planning on a long engagement, maybe.\n\nI don't blame you for being hurt about what was said, but if you're not willing to discuss one hurtful statement with your sister I have some major concerns about your maturity and ability to work out the disputes that absolutely will come up in married life. It doesn't even sound like she was anything more than serious and concerned about you, even if you didn't agree with the concerns. It sounds like she was trying to give you advice from a place of love that you just didn't like.\n\nDo you normally shut people out if they disagree with your opinions or actions? Maybe this is a one-off event because of how seriously you feel about it, but you should consider your past and think about whether or not it is. As a married woman in the future, it will not be an option to just shut out your husband like that. I mean, I guess it would be, as long as you were ok with getting divorced about the issue, too. You'll have to be able to disagree and then discuss it, then eventually compromise. You can't do any of those things if you typically jump to refusing to work it out after feelings are hurt.", "You are not mature enough to be married. YTA\n\nEdited to add that the reason people wait until later in their relationships to get married is not always because they're not sure they love each other enough to commit. It's very often so that they can get a fuller view of each other as people. After six months, how many arguments have you had? Do you know how each other handles conflict? What about a life-altering situation like the death of a family member or a serious illness? Have you had to make any major decisions together about money, where to live, etc? Big experiences like this tell you a lot about a person and a potential future spouse.", "YTA Your sister legitimately is concerned you're rushing into a marriage with a man who is six years older than you and you have known for six months.

You should only get married to someone if you are sure you also know their worst flaws, i doubt any of you do that. \n\nBut its not worth discussing this with you.

When you know you know but its also wise to get to know a person first. We have been married 18 months now.\n\nYou need to have a lot of conversations before you get married. About children , finances, debt, plans for the future, retirement, medical issues, how do you both handle conflict? Not right now but when you are stressed out and frustrated with the other person how do you handle it then? How do you handle disappointment and disagreement?\n\nyta because instead of listening to the person who loves you and known you 24 years with an open mind.

You are not mature enough to get married. \n\nAs the other commentator had mentioned your relationship should not be your entire life or you are going to be in a lot of emotional trouble down the road. \n\nI was you and engaged at 27 after only a year with someone. It went up in flames when we hit our first big fight - he couldn\u2019t handle any kind of conflict and left me stranded in a foreign country. This might not happen to you, but you have not known him long enough to see him in a variety of difficult situations.", "As someone married for over a decade, this is not a healthy way to think of your relationship. At 24, you are going to change in who you are naturally and if you get married your relationship will change over time as well with your living situation, jobs, kids, etc. You need to be confident in being yourself and loving yourself as an individual person first and foremost. \n\n\nThen you have a partner that compliments you and can roll with the changes. Six months is a really quick time to be able to make that call, I would extend the engagement to at least a year. If you already know, then one more year won't hurt anything and you can convince your sister and have great support from your family going forward", "She's being an older sister, she doesnt want to see you hurt if this new relationship takes a turn. My sister would do the same, she's like a second mom to me (we're 12 years apart). \n\nShe is probably just against the speed of the marriage, considering how nasty and vitriolic divorces are more than half the time (especially if kids are involved). You do as you wish, but be careful who you thrown aside.", "If your relationship is you, who were you before? Why do you want to give that person up? And there's so many life events that can change a relationship, or end it such as your partner passing, and who would you be after that?\n\nIf your identity is this relationship it sounds like your sister is concerned and voiced it to you. You asked the question that she was dancing around and didn't like the answer. Now you haven't given her a chance to talk it thru with you.

I\u2019ve often wondered that. Unless you are the \u201cpromise ring virgin\u201d style of people, what\u2019s wrong with being engaged and planning the wedding for a year or two out?\n\nETA: I\u2019m not trying to mock, I\u2019m genuinely asking. The time when you are dating and engaged can be such a sweet time. It\u2019s not only a great way to bond while not having to focus as much in the humdrum of daily life like bills and jobs and errands. You get to meet up just to be in each others\u2019 company which gets harder to do after marriage. It also gives time for you both to integrate into each others\u2019 lives and family. Getting to know your relatives now means a stronger family relationship later. Makes for an easier wedding too since you aren\u2019t figuring out the relatives\u2019 quirks while planning a major event. Just my two cents.", "Oh honey.", "If you are soulmates then you will have the rest of your lives to be together. \n\nYour sister is looking out for you.

You don't know how he deals with long term stress, how he deals with loss, seasonal patterns (does he get SAD in February?), you don't know how he works towards longterm goals, or if he changes his mind on things over the long term. You don't know how he likes to celebrate big anniversaries, or your major accomplishments, how he comforts other people when they need support. There are so many nuances of a shared life that are currently unknowns for you.\n\n\nYou and your fiancee have time, you have time to let your sister get to know him and show her what you see in him.

I agree with your take. She literally asked.", "Exactly. Like the government cares if you\u2019re soulmates.", "I guess I have more sympathy here because I grew up in a cult where it was normal to marry after six *weeks* of an engagement (not that this was a good thing).

Wait a year.", "Do you live together?", "I knew at six months my husband and I would be happily married forever. \n\nOf course, I knew the same thing at 6 months with my ex husband, so its not a perfect system. \n\nIt's less about the length of time and more about the madly in love and soulmates and etc etc and that he and you are willing to cut off your sister for expressing her concerns in an adult manner. Supporting you doesn't mean agreeing with you, sometimes the best way to support someone is to tell them something they don't want to hear.", "Haha, no, I would give the same ruling if he was, it would just offer more explanation. \n\nI'm going with ESH. Consider a long engagement; if it's really meant to be, it will be meant to be a year from now.", "Just commenting that if you want your verdict to count it has to be in the original comment.

You don't have to be married to be seen as the significant other and be allowed in the hospital room. Your life plans won't mean anything if this love story turns into crap.

Like what thousands of people have so that loved ones can make decisions for people when they\u2019re incapacitated. But kicking someone who loves you out of your life because they love you enough to worry about you is a bad precedent. Especially since you won\u2019t even give her a chance to explain what she\u2019s feeling so you can both put this to rest. I\u2019d be worried too, since this is a quick way to isolate yourself. To refuse to talk to someone who cares about you because of a difference of opinion is absurd. YTA.\n\nSo let\u2019s put this into perspective since you seem to be having trouble with that. When you look at your relationship, you know he\u2019s the one, he knows you\u2019re the one, you both are ready to commit to each other. When literally everyone else looks at your relationship, they see two people who have known each other for less than a year deciding to tie the knot and they have no idea why. If these people care about you, they\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019ve thought this through and this isn\u2019t just a whim, and once they understand how you feel and why you feel it, they will come around. Unless your future spouse is actually terrible, in which case you\u2019ll be glad they were more cautious than you. But you are robbing yourself of a relationship just because someone cares enough about you to look out for your well-being.", "Get a medical power of attorney. You don\u2019t have to be married to buy a house. You each report your income no matter your marital status. It\u2019s concerning if you think marriage is the only rock solid legal path for the concerns you listed.", "You can also get a medical power of attorney without being married.

There are lots of life partners out there who deal with this.\n\nThe issue is that you don't know each other. You just know an image. You are in the honeymoon phase, which isn't a lie but it isn't your true self.\n\n\nThis is why people wait, so they can get to know each other. So they can know how they act in anger. if you haven't seen the other mad yet, then you are marrying too soon.", "\nSorry but you need to slow down and listen to your sisters concerns. Ever heard the saying \u201clove is blind\u201d?

Both my husbands I knew the day I met them I wanted to marry them. I had one serious relationship in between I felt the same way but I pumped the breaks and after some time saw red flags. Very glad I didn\u2019t rush into anything there. Yes when you know you know but love isn\u2019t the only ingredient in a successful marriage. So there\u2019s no harm taking a step back and letting the honeymoon feelings fade a bit and seeing if you are missing anything important. \n\nAlso what does your sister have to gain by being upset with you?

I agree that\u2019s not a good reason to get married.

I don\u2019t mean don\u2019t get married, I mean that this is such a nice stage in relationships and it\u2019s hard to recapture once it has passed. Why not enjoy and take the scenic route?

They might be just fine and I don\u2019t think you are going to convince two adults that they don\u2019t actually love each other when they clearly believe in the relationship.

Her whole family was against the marriage, she eloped, he turned out to be a horrible person but after what her family had said/done to try to stop the marriage, she wasn\u2019t going to admit she\u2019d made a mistake.
