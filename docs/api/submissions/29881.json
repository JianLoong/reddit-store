I didn\u2019t mind it at first but then it became to the point where he was always bringing it up everytime in conversation to where everyone seemed annoyed by it. \n\nI\u2019m pretty successful in my career selling one of my businesses for around low 8 figures a year ago and started investing in low-risk investments, I have been living a modest life, own a small 3bd house, starting another business in pest control, and a 2023 civic sport that I paid for in cash. One thing I can\u2019t stand is someone bragging or being flashy about money.\n\nToday, my brother and I were talking about buying a car and he came in and insisted on buying a Tesla because it\u2019s the future of cars, he was bragging about the entire thing and trying to convince my brother that even with the high price it\u2019s worth it. It didn\u2019t bother me until he said \u201cdon\u2019t end up like your brother buying a Honda civic, they\u2019re trash\u201d \n\nI blew up at that point telling him he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, he\u2019s wanted to look rich and pretend to be rich because he has a Tesla meanwhile he\u2019s living at his parents house. I then proceeded to tell him that I had enough money to buy 10 of his teslas in cash and it\u2019s really not impressive but rather makes him seem like a moron trying to brag about owning a Tesla, and If you want to pretend to be rich you should back the talk instead of leasing a Tesla. \n\nThis mad him really upset and left my parents house immediately. \n\nBoth my sister and parents are mad at me because he was trying to be helpful and they thought I was being rude and bragging about my money. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for telling my sisters boyfriend nobody cares about his Tesla?\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAdded context and Update:\n\nI apologize for being an asshole to my parents and sister, I would also like to apologize to Reddit, I didn\u2019t mean to come off as bragging. I spent 6 years building out a service based business that ended up becoming a very niche SaaS for others in the business and sold that to a larger public company for a mixture of stock and cash, you don\u2019t have to believe it doesn\u2019t affect any of us. \n\nI didn\u2019t mean to be an asshole or outburst like that. This came after months of annoyance and disrespect. The boyfriend is a real estate agent and college educated and would often make jokes about being better than other people then back track on them. He looks down on people who didn\u2019t go to college and have hard working jobs. \n\nI will not be apologizing to the boyfriend due to the past few months he has been making comments about how starting a pest control company is a stupid idea, and always trying to give financial advice despite him not actually being qualified to give any advice. \n\nThe attack didn\u2019t just come because of a Honda civic but because he was telling my brother it would be a bad financial decision to get anything other than a Tesla in today\u2019s economy. \n\nI won\u2019t be apologizing to him because he viewed me as another \u201cbroke\u201d person in his life. I do feel terrible for bragging and putting him in his place but I do not regret it because he deserved it. \n\n", "created_utc": 1698558129, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17iwaow/aita_for_telling_my_sisters_boyfriend_nobody/", "score": 3197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
