It's your day and the stress of her being there will WAY overshadow any fallout you get from family from her absence. \n\nAlternatively, you could make the entire day gay AF, like over-the-top crazy with as many digs as possible to small-minded bigots who are probably in the closet anyway, but that's a bad idea and you shouldn't do that.", "YWNBTA, they sound so mean! It's your wedding, inviting them would only turn the mood sour. Good luck in the future!", "YWNBTA. They are not going to come anyway.", "\nYou were able to be at David\u2019s wedding where the vows were openly against you and rude guests came up to you and your sister and you managed to rise above and be a gracious guest and support your cousin.\n\nI think if you give David a heads up so he knows what is coming with invitation.\n\nYou and Sam deserve to have the wedding you want and surrounded by the people you want. I think you are again being gracious by including David after he basically called you out in a negative way at his wedding.\n\nI hope if David comes he comes with an open heart. \n\nYWBTA \n\nCongratulations and wishing you and Sam much happiness.", "WNBTA. Congrats on your wedding! \n\nI mean, it's generous you even want to invite David considering he's an enabling of her behavior. And, stand up proud on this one. She wants to actively target you then you have nothing to be worried about.\n\nI absolutely hate family who cares more about fallout than, like, recognizing you are entitled to not be on the receiving end of bigotry on your wedding day.", "NTA - tell Tania you have a \"no sin - no bring\" rule for your wedding - there will be lots of sinners and she would be uncomfortable (or, more likely, make others uncomfortable).", "YWNBTA, I feel sorry for them and I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that at their wedding. Not sure I would invite David either but that is your choice.", "NTA\n\nBut just skip them both. Even if you invite them I can't see them coming. They have made it pretty clear what they think of your relationship. Only have family that love and support you and your partner.", "It's rich that your parents are \"worried about family fallout\" over you not inviting someone who has been openly hostile towards your fiance, and not when their son married someone who was openly hostile towards both his siblings' SO's. I wouldn't even invite your brother if I were you.", "NTA. Tania clearly has no interest in celebrating or engaging with your relationship. She would not bring joy to your day if she attended either. Be prepared to deal with the likely possibility that David won't attend whether you invite her or not though.", "Invite neither. It is not petty. You are following their wishes that they do not want to be involved or engaged with a same-sex couple", "NTA- but I don\u2019t understand why you would even want David there when he stands by his wife\u2019s behavior towards you.\n\nYou really think he\u2019d show up to support your wedding when him and his wife have made it crystal clear where they stand?\n\nThe cousin you grew up with is long gone OP.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding and focus on the people who are happy for you and your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA, but Y-T-A to yourselves if you invite hostile homophobic people to your wedding where they will have every opportunity to voice their bigoted opinions loudly, as they\u2019ve proven they have no trouble doing. And I am using plural pronouns because *yes that includes David*\u2014that wedding with the homophobic ceremony was his wedding. The guy who\u2019s okay not inviting your partner to his wedding is David. The guy who\u2019s not stopping his wife from being actively hostile towards you is David. You can blame Tania, but David is absolutely complicit, and I\u2019d think twice (or way more than that) about inviting him, cousin or not.\n\nEditing this actually as I hadn\u2019t previously read other comments since I was fired up: I do understand not wanting to be the aggressors from others\u2019 POV and it being easier to follow firm rules about who (family-wise) gets an invite.

I had a family member who I'd previously been quite close to who married a woman who was 'born again'. She'd actually always been lovely to my face, but when my now husband I got married (this was 10 years back), they refused to attend. I was pretty heartbroken, and that was the end of any relationship I had with him. The fallout was worse for him mind you - his parents and his *gay older brother* turned up at the wedding (not having been invited directly), but so scandalized at how their son/brother was behaving that they wanted to come and show support from their branch of the family, which was really lovely.  \n\n\nI guess that's a roundabout way of saying, whatever you choose to do, this behaviour reflects more poorly on them than it does on you. Given her obvious hostility, however, I'd say YWNBTA, and it might pay to just err on the side of caution and not invite either of them.", "Etiquette dictates that you either invite both halves of a married, engaged, or cohabiting couple or you don\u2019t invite either.

Do invite both of them and hint them not to be homophobic. whether they come or not is up to them. As for the explanation, give it to only David.

Good luck!", "NTA. But David has very clearly sided with his wife and *shares* her beliefs. The person you grew up with doesn't exist anymore. The fact that David couldn't be bothered to RSVP at all? Not even to make up some white lie, he made his mother do it for him. It's disrespectful and it shows that *he* is the problem here. It's hard to deal with, and it hurts, but it's reality.\n\nFact is, there's probably no \"good\" reason to only invite David, and both David and Tania would probably make a scene of some form.

He has included Sam in discussions and we are inviting all of his siblings and other family. Not inviting David would risk making us the aggressors/AH in my extended family's eyes.", "Wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. David\u2019s wife seem like a real\u2026piece of work\u2026but personally think it is a good idea to be the bigger person and leave the door open for David. He may very well not attend, but the offer itself is a nice gesture. And if he attends sans-wife, he might just pick up on the fact you aren\u2019t evil", "OP, were you and Sam cohabiting at the time of David & Tania\u2019s wedding?", "Actually this is a good explanation.  It gives a David the choice to be supportive.  Don\u2019t be insulted if he does not come.

A person who was \"nice to you\" would not have excluded Sam from his own big day and then covered it with a lie. Speaking to you at family gatherings is a bare level of civility and you deserve more than that.\n\nI get what you're saying about your family considering you the aggressors if you don't invite David, but honestly those folks are as likely to blame you for not inviting Tania as well (\"they're married after all\") so appeasement may be a losing battle. If they will be mad at you anyway, who do you really hope to celebrate with? Aim for that.\n\nYou're NTA whatever you do, but I'd really encourage you to rethink David's invitation. He can start to understand the consequences of the hateful path he has chosen.", "I mean, Tania violated etiquette, too, but that doesn\u2019t mean OP should do it.

In this instance, it doesn\u2019t sound like Tania is going to come whether you invite her or not and David almost certainly isn\u2019t going to come without Tania.\n\nI get that you\u2019re trying not to make waves, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get away with being able to do that forever and it seems like a parting if the ways between you & Sam and David & Tania is inevitable at some point. I say just rip off the bandaid."]}
