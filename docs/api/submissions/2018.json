Your son is being generous with your wife's time and energy, not his own. The lunches cost him nothing but make him look good to whomever is receiving the food. Now he wants to double dip on that supposed generosity to escape punishment for something unrelated. \n\nSlightly unrelated, but is there a reason your son lies so frequently? Even his good deeds are based on lies.", "NTA. Credit would be due if he exerted even the slightest amount of effort like, for example, telling you that he had a friend that needed food and not making you sleuth for it like Sherlock. It sounds like he has good parents at least. Maybe it\u2019s time for him to learn how to make his own lunches so he can earn some of that recognition he wants so badly.", "Nta\n\nHe conned you and your wife into providing food to his friend. Sure,  you're OK with helping out another kid, but he didn't have the guts to tell you the situation until he was in trouble and tried to use it as a get out of jail free card.  Not ok", "NTA. Good deeds in the past don't erase bad deeds in the present. \"I offed this man but I volunteered at a shelter all last week\" wouldn't work in the real world, nor should it work at your house. One has nothing to do with the other. Also, he lied to you about why he needed the lunch. Now that the lie is out, stop making food for his friends every day. If he wants his friends to eat what he does then he can do the work and learn to make the food himself so your wife isn't being burdened.", "Your son is old enough to pack his own lunch...and his friend's. He broke his sister's phone. He lied about breaking the phone. Now he's trying to plea his grounding and get off for good behavior? \n\nNTA", "NTA in today's world you can't afford your boy to bratty and be someone who always try not hold himself accountable for his mistakes cause the world will eat him alive when he gets out there it's better for him to learn the the way that looks hard to him now than learning when he grows up but you should go into his room and have a 1-1 talk with him cause that would be the best way for him to understand these things", "NTA Your son was not sacrificing anything, he just increased his mothers work load in order to feed someone. I guess he should get credit for carrying the extra meal, but then he lied about why he needed the food so telling lies isn't good either.", "NTA. Doing one good deed does not cancel out a bad deed. Giving food someone else made isn't that high up on the karma scale either. Grounding is completely appropriate. If anything, I would be concerned about his pattern of lying since he lied about why he needed the extra food.", "NTA.  Given the conflicting family dynamic issurs, you've done a good job of steering through the maze and finding an acceptable solution.", "Your son needs to learn \"The actions of the left hand are not erased by the actions of the right hand\". \n\nI know is hard in your teen years, but you all need to work in communication skills. Take a step back and consider the landscape:\n\n* Why is your son giving his food away? \n\n* Why instead of saying \"can I get homemade lunches again?\" He said \"you are not feeding me\" -or whatever negative angle he used.... \n\n* why instead of only the mom making lunches, workout a system in which the son helps prepare them?\n\n* Why does he think giving his lunch away entitles him to not be punished for his bad actions? \n\nAnother lesson he needs to learn, even if his intentions are good, actions carry their own weight (in Spanish we say \"Hell is filled with good intentions\").", "nAH- this doesn\u2019t seem like a big AITA situation. Teens are gonna sulk, and moms are gonna mom, but it seems like your son is a good one for looking out for a friend in need, your wife is a good one for playing along and putting in the extra effort to help, and you\u2019re a good one for recognizing your wife\u2019s contribution and (hopefully) your son\u2019s caring spirit. Teenagers are gonna be sulky, especially if they\u2019re grounded, so as long as your son\u2019s grounding is proportionate to his misbehavior it seems like you have a really kind-hearted, solid, normal little family unit going on. Make sure you let him know that he is grounded for the specific action of breaking the phone and lying, and that separately and apart from that you are proud of him for wanting to help his friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are NTA, and neither is your wife even though she wants you to be \u201cgentler.\u201d", "He lied and showed no appreciation for his mother's effort. You defended her and pointed out his misguided logic. NTA. That said, can he really be expected to understand what he did wrong, when he's 16 years old and mom still makes his lunches for him?  That's probably why your wife told you to be gentler, because she knows she enables his entitlement. She's not TA either, she's just being a mom, but perhaps it's time to teach him some life skills?", "ESH except your wife, your son should have just been honest with you from the get go, and trying to take credit after the fact just comes off wrong, instead of turning this into a teaching moment for your kid you decided to snap back at him, go sit down and talk shit out with your kid", "Isolating your title question, soft YTA.  \n\nYour wife is doing the work preparing the meal but your son is the one who recognized the need and had the compassion to do his little wiggling without outing his friend as going without.  In isolation, it shouldn't go unnoticed, and IMHO should be praised.  \n\nThe rest of the stuff doesn't change that, but the comment talking about \"The actions of the left hand are not erased by the actions of the right hand\" is correct.  It's not relevant to the matter of the phone.  But your question isn't about the phone.  You shouldn't put down his good deeds for his bad ones, even though they don't cancel them.", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s old enough to know better.", "NTA, his punishment should be something constructive to help his mother though. Maybe have him get up early with her so he can learn how to make the lunches himself? He should also do something to pay for the broken phone. Actions have Consequences is a lesson that should be taught as often as possible.", "NTA. Your son's doing a good deed and that's great, but ultimately, it leads back to your wife picking up on the situation and putting in effort to make these lunches as well. While your son has the right idea, using it to then try and get out of an unrelated punishment is not it.\n\nI'd say to maybe have a talk with him where his efforts are validated, but it is made clear about why trying to use it in this context isn't right (and why the mom should also be recognised, because he could've also maybe bought food for the kid instead of asking for extra homemade food to be cooked)", "NTA - not only is he taking credit for work that she did, the way he got her to do it was by lying about what was going on, and guilting her about not providing enough nutrition for him while giving it away.\n\nFrankly he ought to start getting up early and help with the prep, so he has a better idea of what she actually does for him.  Right now he hasn\u2019t a clue, and his complacent ignorance is leading him to behave obnoxiously.\n\nYes it is typical of a teen to be testing the limits of acceptable behavior.  It\u2019s also your job as a parent to not fall for the foolishness.", "NTA but I don\u2019t know any 16-year-olds whose mommies still make their lunch.", "Info: Why are you and your wife doing all the chores? He's 16. He should be making his own lunch and helping around the house.", "NTA but your son is. He\u2019s old enough to make his own lunch.

Then slipped up, as kids/teens do, when trying to evade a punishment for something that for all we know is a normal \u2018pushing of boundaries\u2019 for a kid his age.

I guess by the son's logic, this means his sister gets a free swing at his stuff if she puts it into the hamper correctly.", "Btw he does deserve some credit for what he did because it was his idea to be nice to someone but you should tell him that a good deed doesn't cover up the bad things he has done how my dad told me was that he asked me if you score 40 points and 8 assist in a game but have 6 turnovers and got 30 scored on you was it a good game i said no my offense output doesn't make up for my defensive deficiency and just silly turnovers he said that's how it works in life too and if you don't hold yourself Accountable then you won't improve", "I came here to say something similar but u/Echoesintheabyss already said it perfectly! OP, you should approach this situation with more curiosity and ask your son those questions.", "1. His friend likes my wife\u2019s cooking more than the cafeteria. My son goes to a public school in an affluent area. No other reason. \n2. My wife had always made homemade lunches. Now, for his friend, she adds more meat a d gives a combination of cut and sliced fruit and things like that in case his friend was food insecure to tide his friend over until the next day. \n3. My wife and I believe that the school system makes children get up too early so we allow them to sleep as much as possible before school starts. My children do have chores.\n4. I think it was just a sympathy ploy. My son\u2019s at an age where he\u2019s both a good kid and a petulant teenager.", "I agree with this. I definitely think he needs grounded and that helping his friend is not a get out of jail free card, but the fact he was helping his friend, who may have asked him not to say anything, shows a kind heart.", "I\u2019m still not understanding why giving his food away was a good deed. It isn\u2019t hard to say, hey mom, this kid really loves you food, could you pack me extra? Instead of being all aggressive about it and claiming he wasn\u2019t being fed enough. He lied and it wasn\u2019t even about something that matters, what else does he lie about?  NTA.", "At 16 my son was doing his laundry and packing his own lunches and scrubbing toilets and washing dishes - cuz he was bigger than me by the time he was 11 and everybody in my house needs to help out. WTH? Making his lunch? Dude? You're old enough to drive. Make it yourself?", "He lied about his \u201cgood deed,\u201d though, and the burden was on his mother to provide a separate lunch. Then he tried to use the good deed to get out of punishment.", "Aww, your wife is so nice. But I feel there are elements to be explored here. Did the friend even say thank you? Are they even aware your wife adjusted the menu to better suit them? \n\nEven more important, that still does not answer some of the questions posted earlier. I hope they serve as an opening to a constructive discussion with your son. For example, yes the friend likes these meals better, but why did your son offer them in the first place? Especially after not bringing them for a while?", "It\u2019s tough at that age to eloquently verbalize needs, especially if his friend has family that has issues with the same. I completely understand him not communicating that with his parents, it\u2019s possible the friend didn\u2019t even communicate it with him and he just picked up on it, like his parents did. None of that has any relevance to his grounding though, but I remember being a teen trying to pull anything out of the woodwork to get out of a punishment. The kid isn\u2019t a liar or an ah, he\u2019s a kid who is being punished for something completely justified who is trying to wiggle out of it because he\u2019s a teen who doesn\u2019t want to be in trouble. Definitely not a get out of jail free card, but also a good chance for op to reflect on the fact that he\u2019s raising a good kid (at least as in the helping a friend situation) and to reinforce those values outside and apart from his current punishment.", "As I said he needs to understand good deeds don't cover his bad deed", "No I have not met the friend or know what they think of the sitation. My son is aware that his mother adjusted the menu and spent more time out of her day to make food. \n\nMy wife has always made lunches for the kids but while my daughter eats everything, my son always leaves a bit of food behind because he didn\u2019t want to finish the last bite of food. He likely offered his friend some food who liked it and asked if he could get more or my son offered to get more. I swapped parts of my lunch with friends at that age.\n\nEither way, the burden fell on my wife. If my son truly wanted to do a good deed, he could\u2019ve made his friend\u2019s lunch himself. The kitchen is open. He knows how hard it is to do what his mother does and he just added to her workload. I believe my wife should get the credit.", "Yep, I totally agree with you! Kids sometimes have a hard time thinking outside themselves, but this boy did. As for the bargining, that seems pretty on par for a teen to me. I'm also glad his mom was packing the lunches, truthfully. As a mom of 2 teens myself, if my kids had a friend in that situation, and I knew or suspected what was going on, I'd prefer to pack the lunch to ensure it was chock full of healthy stuff and maybe even a little something for later. Heaven only knows what my kids would pack for their friends, and I didn't get the vibe at all that the mom minded packing the extra lunch, even if it did take extra time and energy. Mom's are gonna mom.", "Right, I think we just disagree that he deserves any credit for his \u201cgood deed.\u201d", "NTA, Princess son is", "NTA\n\nGood on calling your son out, your wife was working harder and stretching himself and your son thought that him just handing out his lunch was something big. There's nothing to be gentle about here, you only said the truth.", "NTA...your wife should get the credit.", "NTA. A good deed would have been him making the extra food himself. A 16 year old does not need their mum to make them their packed lunches either, your wife is doing him a disservice, he needs the truth and he needs to learn to stand on his own two feet.", ">My wife and I believe that the school system makes children get up too early so we allow them to sleep as much as possible before school starts. \n\nthat's pretty cool of you dude, one suggestion I have is maybe your son can make up his own lunches the previous afternoon/evening and store them in the fridge till school time to help ease the pressure a bit", "I agree on all the housekeeping points (I was doing my own laundry by grade 2 and always had regular chores) but when it comes to the lunches... my mom made me lunches all through high school because she knew if she didn't, I just wouldn't eat. Teenagers are weird, man. Granted, I'm on the spectrum, but we didn't know that at the time.  \n\n\nShe didn't do crazy fancy bento boxes, though. I'd get like... a pita filled with lettuce and hummus. And maybe a granola bar."]}
