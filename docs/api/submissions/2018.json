Even his good deeds are based on lies.", "NTA. Credit would be due if he exerted even the slightest amount of effort like, for example, telling you that he had a friend that needed food and not making you sleuth for it like Sherlock.

Good deeds in the past don't erase bad deeds in the present. \"I offed this man but I volunteered at a shelter all last week\" wouldn't work in the real world, nor should it work at your house.

Teenagers are gonna be sulky, especially if they\u2019re grounded, so as long as your son\u2019s grounding is proportionate to his misbehavior it seems like you have a really kind-hearted, solid, normal little family unit going on. Make sure you let him know that he is grounded for the specific action of breaking the phone and lying, and that separately and apart from that you are proud of him for wanting to help his friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You defended her and pointed out his misguided logic. NTA. That said, can he really be expected to understand what he did wrong, when he's 16 years old and mom still makes his lunches for him?

Right now he hasn\u2019t a clue, and his complacent ignorance is leading him to behave obnoxiously.\n\nYes it is typical of a teen to be testing the limits of acceptable behavior.

Then he tried to use the good deed to get out of punishment.", "Aww, your wife is so nice. But I feel there are elements to be explored here. Did the friend even say thank you? Are they even aware your wife adjusted the menu to better suit them? \n\nEven more important, that still does not answer some of the questions posted earlier. I hope they serve as an opening to a constructive discussion with your son. For example, yes the friend likes these meals better, but why did your son offer them in the first place? Especially after not bringing them for a while?", "It\u2019s tough at that age to eloquently verbalize needs, especially if his friend has family that has issues with the same. I completely understand him not communicating that with his parents, it\u2019s possible the friend didn\u2019t even communicate it with him and he just picked up on it, like his parents did. None of that has any relevance to his grounding though, but I remember being a teen trying to pull anything out of the woodwork to get out of a punishment. The kid isn\u2019t a liar or an ah, he\u2019s a kid who is being punished for something completely justified who is trying to wiggle out of it because he\u2019s a teen who doesn\u2019t want to be in trouble. Definitely not a get out of jail free card, but also a good chance for op to reflect on the fact that he\u2019s raising a good kid (at least as in the helping a friend situation) and to reinforce those values outside and apart from his current punishment.", "As I said he needs to understand good deeds don't cover his bad deed", "No I have not met the friend or know what they think of the sitation. My son is aware that his mother adjusted the menu and spent more time out of her day to make food. \n\nMy wife has always made lunches for the kids but while my daughter eats everything, my son always leaves a bit of food behind because he didn\u2019t want to finish the last bite of food. He likely offered his friend some food who liked it and asked if he could get more or my son offered to get more. I swapped parts of my lunch with friends at that age.\n\nEither way, the burden fell on my wife. If my son truly wanted to do a good deed, he could\u2019ve made his friend\u2019s lunch himself.

Kids sometimes have a hard time thinking outside themselves, but this boy did. As for the bargining, that seems pretty on par for a teen to me. I'm also glad his mom was packing the lunches, truthfully. As a mom of 2 teens myself, if my kids had a friend in that situation, and I knew or suspected what was going on, I'd prefer to pack the lunch to ensure it was chock full of healthy stuff and maybe even a little something for later. Heaven only knows what my kids would pack for their friends, and I didn't get the vibe at all that the mom minded packing the extra lunch, even if it did take extra time and energy.

Teenagers are weird, man. Granted, I'm on the spectrum, but we didn't know that at the time.  \n\n\nShe didn't do crazy fancy bento boxes, though.

My 7 year old makes her own lunch sometimes (she loves doing \"big kid\" things though). The fact that she's 7 and has the skills to do it let's me know OP's 16 year old can do it too. Doesn't have to be fancy, a simple PB&J is still a lunch.", "Mom wouldn\u2019t let us make out lunches till high school mainly because she didn\u2019t trust us with knives and such at a young age and we would all get taught over the summer individually once we finished primary on proper kitchen etiquette. But did dishes and all other chores from age 5 up", "My kid was about that age when he wanted to start helping make his lunches!", "Oh yeah, we do not let her use sharp knives. We have kids plastic butter knives for when she makes her sandwiches. She's with me a lot in the kitchen when I cook and has a good handle on the basics so far. Dishes are the only chore she will do with no complaints! Making her bed? You'd think I asked her to give me her kidney. It sounds like your mom did a great job teaching you all how to take care of yourselves while still being present in it. OP should take your bit into consideration, 16 is plenty old enough to be taught how to handle things in the kitchen with some good instruction.", "Yeah she basically raised herself and her younger sister from the age 12 and wanted us to have those same life skills. Honestly worked out great because I have mates who at the age of 30 struggle with them as they had their mum do everything for them all the time.

Your son is spoiled and prone to lying and trying to con others. He never directly told his mother way he wanted more food. He just complained. She has to figure it out. He broke his sister\u2019s phone and then lied and then tried to use his original lie as some sort of good deed. He doesn\u2019t know how to take accountability for his actions. You did good in letting him know he can\u2019t take credit for others good deeds.", "NTA. Why would your son deserve credit for treating your wife like a member of staff he does not respect, being nasty to his sister, and lying to both of you adults?\n\nI mean my question is why was your wife even going along with this and putting in all this effort and allowing him to boss her around, and is even telling you that you should back off? How is he supposed to improve if you guys the parents are not teaching him how to behave? Your wife is setting a bad example and telling him that he's allowed to be rude", "NTA - if your son has opinions about cooking, no doubt the kitchen is available for him \n\nIt sounds like he fees entitled to lodge complaints with 'management' as though he was in a hotel.  \n\nYou are right - he is doing a good dead and the work involved is done by his mother.", "NTA it\u2019s very easy to be generous with someone else\u2019s time and money and then take the credit, which is what your son is doing. \n\nAnd lying about it to start with to booth.

Real world is a hell of a lot tougher than this and he will be eaten alive cuz mommy cant save him from the real world.", "NTA. The two things are unrelated. His (and your wife\u2019s) kindness do not magically erase the wrong he did to his sister.", "NTA. He could make his own lunch, I was making mine at 14.

It is a concern that your son lies so much and is so manipulative.", "Seriously, it sounds like the mom is coddling him and that's why even at the age of 16 he thinks it's so acceptable for him to act like this much of an asshole. There aren't any consequences to his bad behavior, so why not be the worst?", "I always felt bad for my mom because she actually LOVED making lunches for us, but I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to eat lunch in school because the texture of the food would be different by the time lunch rolled around.\n\n(I let her know I didn\u2019t want her to make lunches anymore so she wouldn\u2019t waste her time and she\u2019d usually send me with just a granola bar or other packaged, non-soggifiable food lol)", "We actually had a recurring issue with the pita when it came to its shelf-life.  \n\n\nMy one special request when she made my lunch was, please don't put lettuce spines in the pita. Because by the time lunch rolled around, the pita would have soaked up all the hummus's moisture and become super soft. So if there was a hard lettuce spine in there, one bite would make the entire thing just split straight down the middle and then everything would just go everywhere.  \n\n\nWhich leads me to how my mom is a fucking *saint*, because I remember a couple years ago I was at her place and she served me a salad, and I got kind of frustrated because it was hard to get the lettuce on my fork because there were no spines so there was nothing for my fork to bite in to, so I mentioned it to my mom, and turns out *she had picked all of the spines out of my bowl because she thought I didn't like them, period.* She had basically hand-picked each individual leaf of my salad for me. If that's not love, I don't know what is.", "> texture of the food would be different\n\nAnd everything manages to taste like the lunch box/bag.", "I hated this too! Still do! The bread becomes mush and is GROSS! \n\nWe rarely packed our lunches, school lunches were hot food for super cheap and for our school were planned and overseen by our grandma. On the rare occasions that I took my lunch, the meat, cheese and veggies would be packed in a separate baggie and I would assemble the sandwich at school. \n\nOn a side note, why do so many people pack a lunch for school?

So she would literally make me breakfast (stuff like pancakes and french toast), walk in to my room, hand it to me in bed so I'd have to wake up, and leave.\n\nI mean, obviously it mean she got to slowly wake up in the other room (I come by my desire for a slow morning wake up honestly) but she was both amazing and a little insane. Who does that?", "Leaving the last bite of food as a rule is such a wasteful and borderline insulting habit. Why does he do this, and have you ever tried to correct him?", "A lot of salads and that you know which involved chopping up veggies\u2026.and cool go ahead and do what you want. We were 12 when she taught us proper knife handling skills and how to not hurt ourselves.", "Kids can learn to use knives younger than that, but okay. It just makes me think of the parents who won't let their kids use the stove or oven because they might burn themselves, as though adults don't also sometimes burn themselves.", "Cool you can teach your own kids how to handle chef knives at 6 than", "There are other knives that can cut veggies besides chef knives. A paring knife will do just fine.", "This is a really weird hill for you to be dying on. \n\nOP shared what their personal experience was; based on their moms parenting choices\u2026I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re arguing.", "NTA. You and your wife did all the work (money earning, shopping, planning, assembly, etc). He just had the idea. Which is sweet but no, he doesn\u2019t get credit.", "INFO:  Is he sharing the lunch because the friend thought it was delicious, or because the friend isn't getting enough food at home?", "NTA. You were absolutely right and it's important that your son realise that there isn't a magic tree that fulfils all of his wants and needs. He has been shitty to his mother throughout this entire thing. He could have asked for more food without accusing her of starving him.", "NTA. Tbh, your son is old enough to make his own lunches and *should* have been doing so for years. My siblings could all get themselves ready for school all on their own by 13 - they just needed someone in the house to make sure they woke up.\n\nYou guys need to be knuckling down on teaching him not to rely on his parents, because he's gonna be an adult in two years. Mum needs to stop making his lunches - he is not going to die if he has to eat sandwiches. And perhaps then, he'll understand how much work he was making her put in for all those years.", "NTA.

(Although sadly that\u2019s exactly how sexual harrassment and rape have often been minimized, sigh.) Also even that action started with a lie defaming his own mother - that she wasn\u2019t feeding him enough.\n\nI also think you pointing out his mom is the one doing the actual work is appropriate.", "Nah. The kid is trying to be good to his friend and evade punishment. I remember when I was 16, I had no concept of how long it took to cook things. And I sulked. But, it\u2019s time he can start learning and understanding. Does his friend need help but your son doesn't know how to communicate this?", "NTA but I think you should have your 16 year old make both his and his friends lunches everyday and have more chores and boundaries to help him in the future. It\u2019ll help him respect him mother more in the very least.", "His punishment should be making some of his own lunches from now on.", "Nta", "They are raising a lawyer not a chef lol.", "Totally agree with this. If you don't teach your kids how to be independent ( cooking, laundry, grocery shopping, financial responsibilities, etc.) then you are not helping to become successful adults. Gender typing basic living skills isn't realistic either. Girls aren't the only ones that need to learn to cook and do laundry. Men don't always get married right out school. Spouses die and leave gaps in family dynamics.

Instead he essentially accused his mom of neglect by claiming she wasn't making enough to guilt trip her into making more. He hasn't sacrificed anything.", "My 13 year olds have been making (not just cereal) their own breakfast and lunches for nearly two years. They told me stop after I noticed returning lunches and they told me that they didn't like it. I told them to make their own (ngl was a bit hurt. Ioved doing this for them). The only things I'd make for them for breakfast is oats (they could never get the texture right) or soft porridge (from ground mielie meal). Otherwise pancakes, French toast, waffles even muffins, they're own their own unless they ask for help. \n\nMy daughter home schools but my son is in a brick and mortar school. Just before bed I'll smell something cooking and he's making himself something for lunch the next day. My daughter loves cooking and will experiment for breakfast and lunch daily. I cook supper about 4 times a week and we have left overs other two nights and maybe takeaways once week or they sort themselves out for supper.\n\nThe only mommy meal they were KNOW they're guaranteed is huge Sunday mommy lunch with 6 veg, rice, two meats etc.\n\nThis 16 year old is just a dick and damn lucky he's not my son.", "He's a child. He can help out but making his own every day is ridiculous. Don't want to do the work, don't have children.", "Sadly, yes. Teenagers often do not treat technology well, because they have a poor sense of consequences. I saw multiple kids literally just throw their computers/phones down flights of stairs, when I was in school. Then they'd always get upset when they broke.  \nMy own sister broke her phone trying to throw it off a cliff to a friend of hers. She just didn't have the thought \"I shouldn't do this, because it might break\" - it never occurred to her.", "Boundary pushing is absolutely something teenagers do. Teens are a *lot* more similar to toddlers than you might think - they're both in transitional stages, where a *lot* about them is changing very quickly, emotions are difficult to control, and they want to be far more independent than they're actually capable of being. They're *very* similar life stages, just at opposite ends of childhood. So yes, a 16 year old will push boundaries in a very similar way to a 2 year old. Because they're reacting to the exact same circumstances.\n\nThat doesn't mean you excuse it. Boundary pushing needs to be answered with a firm reminder of what the boundaries are and why they exist.", "This is a bad take. He's sixteen. Every sixteen year old  I've *ever* known has basically fed themselves, with the exception of one big \"Family meal\" each day.  Heck, I knew a set of twins who owned and ran their own household by this age, while attending school, because their mother had *died*. So they just took care of themselves, as if they were adults. Should they have needed to do that? God no. But they handled it pretty well.\n\nThis kid can literally drive. If he's old enough to take other people's lives into his hands, he is old enough to make his own lunch.", "I was the same. I felt bad because so much effort was being put in to make me those lunches - but I couldn't eat most of them by lunch time, because I *really* can't stand sandwiches if they're not fresh. Like I can't do it; I will actually gag.  \n So I went through a period where I was straight-up giving most of my food to other people, and then buying food (with my own money; I had a job) to make up the short-fall. With that said, I also didn't volunteer my caregivers to make *extra* food, like OP's kid did.", "Some cultures leave a little food on the plate because otherwise it's seen as your host not giving you enough.

I hope everything you wrote here has also been communicated to her and she knows her efforts are so recognized and appreciated. You also sound like a wonderful human for simply being aware of how great your mom is and how loved you are (rather than thinking you're entitled like some posts here).", "Because school lunch is often gross? Depending on your school district, of course. The only sandwiches my kid will eat at school are chicken salad or peanut butter. They're the only ones that taste OK to her after being pre-made and sitting in a bag for a few hours. She's not allowed to eat peanut butter in school unless she sits in PB jail, so I make her chicken salad sandwiches several days a week. Even the same thing is better than school food, apparently, except Friday when they get pizza. When she was younger and able to bring a lunchbox, I would make her a bento and fill it with assorted things, but now she'd have to carry the bento around all day and they're too heavy to add to her already heavy school bag. (Yes, she has a locker, but she refuses to use it. Almost no one at her school uses the lockers, don't get me started on kids today! Cue the song from Bye Bye Birdie...)", "At least where I am from- school lunches are disgusting. Every Friday was \u201cpizza day\u201d line up for your cardboard rectangle and spoonful of half cooked corn. \u201cSalisbury steak mondays\u201d were better described as mystery \u201cmeat\u201d mondays. Get a puck of ground \u201cmeat\u201d with the consistency of congealed fat, covered in an insanely salty \u201cgravy\u201d served up with equally salty instant potatoes. Don\u2019t like any of that? Try the salad bar! $5 extra in cash per day. The lettuce is all brown and most other things are warm and slimy cause they\u2019ve been sitting there since first period. Thanks for stopping by Wild and Wonderful West Virginia Public School lunch program!", "At least in Canada, school cafeterias are not a thing (or are pretty rare, from the places I've been to). Parents are expected to provide food, though they sometimes don't and emergency lunches are kept handy. My high school had a snack machine and that's it!", "To be fair, I graduated high school in the mid 2000s and I never used my locker either. The building was huge and my locker wasn't near any of my classes. I did not have time to get from class to locker to next class in four minutes, the stairwells were too crowded.", "Her school is actually quite small, her graduating class is 120 kids, I think. They just don't, for some reason. My school was also very large, so we shared lockers. Drove the administration crazy, because if they found something in a locker, they had no one specific to blame if ten kids were using that locker during the day and potentially more had the combination. This was in the \"just say no\" days when lockers were frequently searched for drugs. I once did get a guy in trouble by abadoning an open bottle of scotch in his locker (he raped a friend of mine who didn't want to tell anyone so I got him back the best way I could.) He didn't share his locker, but his ex knew his combination. I balanced the scotch so it would tip and leak once people kept slamming doors and make it obvious that there was alcohol in there.", "NTA.

An age appropriate one, but still he'll never outgrow it if he's allowed to get away with it. And he does need to see that that food doesn't just happen because he said so. Your wife works to make those. It's a sign you guys are on the right track that he saw someone with a need and wanted to fill it, but with teenagers sometimes it's 2 steps forward one step back. He'll get there.", "Wth. I thought the kids was 6 not 16. Kid needs to start participating in his own care. He's going to be leaving for post secondary soon, what's he going to do without mom to feed him and his friends? Ughhhhhhhhh.\n\nEsh because kid is super selfish and but you let him to get to *16* with this attitude", "NTA. His intentions may have been good, but he never actually gave anything of himself. All he did was lie to get more food out of you.

NTA here but his general behaviour seems really concerning to me.", "NTA.  He is old enough to pack his own lunches if he doesn't like how or what his mom packs.  He shouldn't be pressuring her.  But do you know this friend that he's giving his lunch to?  If you do, you might want to find out why the friend doesn't have enough food.  I'm also a little concerned that this could be bullying.  You might want to dig deeper into your son's story.  16 yo boys are usually ravenous eaters.  Going without lunch is not normal and could be a symptom of something bigger.", "NTA for this. YTA for not having him make his own lunch. Part of your job as a parent is to get him ready for life in the real world; he's too old to have mommy making his lunch for him.", "NTA and good call on your wife being the benevolent one.  You both knew he was giving the food to someone else and your wife continued to make him two lunches.

That's true, adoring love.", "Plus I remember the lunch monitors forcing kids to eat everything off their lunch tray.
