Even his good deeds are based on lies.", "NTA. Credit would be due if he exerted even the slightest amount of effort like, for example, telling you that he had a friend that needed food and not making you sleuth for it like Sherlock.

Good deeds in the past don't erase bad deeds in the present. \"I offed this man but I volunteered at a shelter all last week\" wouldn't work in the real world, nor should it work at your house.

Teenagers are gonna be sulky, especially if they\u2019re grounded, so as long as your son\u2019s grounding is proportionate to his misbehavior it seems like you have a really kind-hearted, solid, normal little family unit going on. Make sure you let him know that he is grounded for the specific action of breaking the phone and lying, and that separately and apart from that you are proud of him for wanting to help his friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You defended her and pointed out his misguided logic. NTA. That said, can he really be expected to understand what he did wrong, when he's 16 years old and mom still makes his lunches for him?  That's probably why your wife told you to be gentler, because she knows she enables his entitlement.

Your son's doing a good deed and that's great, but ultimately, it leads back to your wife picking up on the situation and putting in effort to make these lunches as well.

Right now he hasn\u2019t a clue, and his complacent ignorance is leading him to behave obnoxiously.\n\nYes it is typical of a teen to be testing the limits of acceptable behavior.

Then he tried to use the good deed to get out of punishment.", "Aww, your wife is so nice. But I feel there are elements to be explored here. Did the friend even say thank you? Are they even aware your wife adjusted the menu to better suit them? \n\nEven more important, that still does not answer some of the questions posted earlier. I hope they serve as an opening to a constructive discussion with your son. For example, yes the friend likes these meals better, but why did your son offer them in the first place? Especially after not bringing them for a while?", "It\u2019s tough at that age to eloquently verbalize needs, especially if his friend has family that has issues with the same. I completely understand him not communicating that with his parents, it\u2019s possible the friend didn\u2019t even communicate it with him and he just picked up on it, like his parents did. None of that has any relevance to his grounding though, but I remember being a teen trying to pull anything out of the woodwork to get out of a punishment. The kid isn\u2019t a liar or an ah, he\u2019s a kid who is being punished for something completely justified who is trying to wiggle out of it because he\u2019s a teen who doesn\u2019t want to be in trouble. Definitely not a get out of jail free card, but also a good chance for op to reflect on the fact that he\u2019s raising a good kid (at least as in the helping a friend situation) and to reinforce those values outside and apart from his current punishment.", "As I said he needs to understand good deeds don't cover his bad deed", "No I have not met the friend or know what they think of the sitation. My son is aware that his mother adjusted the menu and spent more time out of her day to make food. \n\nMy wife has always made lunches for the kids but while my daughter eats everything, my son always leaves a bit of food behind because he didn\u2019t want to finish the last bite of food. He likely offered his friend some food who liked it and asked if he could get more or my son offered to get more. I swapped parts of my lunch with friends at that age.\n\nEither way, the burden fell on my wife. If my son truly wanted to do a good deed, he could\u2019ve made his friend\u2019s lunch himself. The kitchen is open. He knows how hard it is to do what his mother does and he just added to her workload. I believe my wife should get the credit.", "Yep, I totally agree with you! Kids sometimes have a hard time thinking outside themselves, but this boy did. As for the bargining, that seems pretty on par for a teen to me. I'm also glad his mom was packing the lunches, truthfully. As a mom of 2 teens myself, if my kids had a friend in that situation, and I knew or suspected what was going on, I'd prefer to pack the lunch to ensure it was chock full of healthy stuff and maybe even a little something for later. Heaven only knows what my kids would pack for their friends, and I didn't get the vibe at all that the mom minded packing the extra lunch, even if it did take extra time and energy.

Teenagers are weird, man. Granted, I'm on the spectrum, but we didn't know that at the time.  \n\n\nShe didn't do crazy fancy bento boxes, though.

My 7 year old makes her own lunch sometimes (she loves doing \"big kid\" things though). The fact that she's 7 and has the skills to do it let's me know OP's 16 year old can do it too. Doesn't have to be fancy, a simple PB&J is still a lunch.", "Mom wouldn\u2019t let us make out lunches till high school mainly because she didn\u2019t trust us with knives and such at a young age and we would all get taught over the summer individually once we finished primary on proper kitchen etiquette. But did dishes and all other chores from age 5 up", "My kid was about that age when he wanted to start helping make his lunches!", "Oh yeah, we do not let her use sharp knives. We have kids plastic butter knives for when she makes her sandwiches. She's with me a lot in the kitchen when I cook and has a good handle on the basics so far. Dishes are the only chore she will do with no complaints! Making her bed? You'd think I asked her to give me her kidney. It sounds like your mom did a great job teaching you all how to take care of yourselves while still being present in it. OP should take your bit into consideration, 16 is plenty old enough to be taught how to handle things in the kitchen with some good instruction.", "Yeah she basically raised herself and her younger sister from the age 12 and wanted us to have those same life skills. Honestly worked out great because I have mates who at the age of 30 struggle with them as they had their mum do everything for them all the time.

Your son is spoiled and prone to lying and trying to con others. He never directly told his mother way he wanted more food. He just complained. She has to figure it out. He broke his sister\u2019s phone and then lied and then tried to use his original lie as some sort of good deed. He doesn\u2019t know how to take accountability for his actions. You did good in letting him know he can\u2019t take credit for others good deeds.", "NTA. Why would your son deserve credit for treating your wife like a member of staff he does not respect, being nasty to his sister, and lying to both of you adults?\n\nI mean my question is why was your wife even going along with this and putting in all this effort and allowing him to boss her around, and is even telling you that you should back off? How is he supposed to improve if you guys the parents are not teaching him how to behave? Your wife is setting a bad example and telling him that he's allowed to be rude", "NTA - if your son has opinions about cooking, no doubt the kitchen is available for him \n\nIt sounds like he fees entitled to lodge complaints with 'management' as though he was in a hotel.  \n\nYou are right - he is doing a good dead and the work involved is done by his mother.", "NTA it\u2019s very easy to be generous with someone else\u2019s time and money and then take the credit, which is what your son is doing. \n\nAnd lying about it to start with to booth.

Real world is a hell of a lot tougher than this and he will be eaten alive cuz mommy cant save him from the real world.", "NTA. The two things are unrelated. His (and your wife\u2019s) kindness do not magically erase the wrong he did to his sister.", "NTA. He could make his own lunch, I was making mine at 14.

It is a concern that your son lies so much and is so manipulative.", "Seriously, it sounds like the mom is coddling him and that's why even at the age of 16 he thinks it's so acceptable for him to act like this much of an asshole. There aren't any consequences to his bad behavior, so why not be the worst?", "I always felt bad for my mom because she actually LOVED making lunches for us, but I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to eat lunch in school because the texture of the food would be different by the time lunch rolled around.\n\n(I let her know I didn\u2019t want her to make lunches anymore so she wouldn\u2019t waste her time and she\u2019d usually send me with just a granola bar or other packaged, non-soggifiable food lol)", "We actually had a recurring issue with the pita when it came to its shelf-life.  \n\n\nMy one special request when she made my lunch was, please don't put lettuce spines in the pita. Because by the time lunch rolled around, the pita would have soaked up all the hummus's moisture and become super soft. So if there was a hard lettuce spine in there, one bite would make the entire thing just split straight down the middle and then everything would just go everywhere.  \n\n\nWhich leads me to how my mom is a fucking *saint*, because I remember a couple years ago I was at her place and she served me a salad, and I got kind of frustrated because it was hard to get the lettuce on my fork because there were no spines so there was nothing for my fork to bite in to, so I mentioned it to my mom, and turns out *she had picked all of the spines out of my bowl because she thought I didn't like them, period.* She had basically hand-picked each individual leaf of my salad for me. If that's not love, I don't know what is.", "> texture of the food would be different\n\nAnd everything manages to taste like the lunch box/bag.", "I hated this too! Still do! The bread becomes mush and is GROSS! \n\nWe rarely packed our lunches, school lunches were hot food for super cheap and for our school were planned and overseen by our grandma. On the rare occasions that I took my lunch, the meat, cheese and veggies would be packed in a separate baggie and I would assemble the sandwich at school. \n\nOn a side note, why do so many people pack a lunch for school?

A paring knife will do just fine.", "This is a really weird hill for you to be dying on. \n\nOP shared what their personal experience was; based on their moms parenting choices\u2026I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re arguing."]}
