{"id": 17869, "submission_id": "13oaavn", "title": "AITA for telling my neighbor it\u2019s her fault her kid got knocked over in our yard?", "selftext": "So I live next door to a house with two young boys. I believe they are 6 and 8. We are separated by a chain link fence. These kids like to play ball outside, as most boys that age do, and occasionally a ball gets thrown over the fence. I have told their mother several times, if that ever happens, come to my front door and I will get the ball. I said that because I have a boxer, he\u2019s about 80 pounds. He\u2019s very well behaved, he would never bite anyone, but when he\u2019s in our very big yard he\u2019s very rambunctious, because that\u2019s his time to have the zoomies and just generally be a dog. So yesterday I let my dog out to go potty and play for a bit, like I usually do, but not even five minutes later I hear my neighbor pounding at my front door. It was the mother of the two boys. She immediately started cursing me, saying that her son had climbed the fence to retrieve one of his baseballs, and my dog had gotten too excited and knocked him down. I was concerned initially, asking if her son was hurt. She said, \u201cno he wasn\u2019t hurt, he just got a little dirty.\u201d So obviously my next question was, \u201cwhy was your son in my yard.\u201d BTW she was FUMING at this point, saying that her son lost his ball and she had told him to climb over the fence to get it back. Then I mentioned that I had warned her to just come to my front door and ask for the toy back because of this exact situation. She started SCREAMING at me talking about legal action and saying shit like my dog needs to be sterilized. Her kids were on MY property without my permission. I do not think I\u2019m at fault here whatsoever, but what do you guys think? Because this woman keeps pestering me about controlling my dog, even though he has been trained and is incredibly well behaved 99% of the time.\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m a college kid who just moved into this house with a couple roommates. We love our dog more than anything in the entire world. We\u2019re inexperienced when it comes to legal pressure and neighbor complaints, so we are all TERRIFIED that she will somehow get our dog taken. He is literally the sweetest boy in the world, but he\u2019s a younger RESCUE boxer so he still gets a little wound up around small children. :( \n\n\nEdit 2: also for those wondering he has been fixed! He was fixed over a year ago when he was 1. that\u2019s why her comments were so wild to me.\n\nEDIT 3: SHE JUST TEXTED MY ROOMMATE SAYING SHES CALLING ANIMAL CONTROL WTF\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "created_utc": 1684712916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13oaavn/aita_for_telling_my_neighbor_its_her_fault_her/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
