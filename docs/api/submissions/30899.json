However, the fact remains that without a very good, specific reason to exclude a spouse, especially your father's, not inviting her is an asshole move, and you can't expect your relationships with your father or those close to him not to suffer (it sounds like you know there will be fallout, I'm just emphasizing it).\n\nETA: None of the above applies to your stepsister - stepmom should be invited by virtue of being dad's spouse barring mitigating circumstances, but that doesn't apply to your adult(?) stepsister with whom you have little to no relationship.", "Without more info, YTA.

But this isn't a graduation, a birthday, or even buying a house and living together. All are invited. We want our family to be present and witness our union and support us as we unite these families in the spirit of love. Humans are gregarious. We need the company of others. We are lucky when we find someone who is willing to be that company, and witness each other until one can't any longer, for any number of reasons. That's huge!  You found someone, and I congratulate you.\n\nBut your wedding is making that statement. It's also uniting both your families, that means, more family members, and more people you may not get along with either.\n\nWe are humans. We have different personalities. It's impossible to like everyone. We try to, at least. I'm not here to judge. He doesn't have a fantastic relationship with all his family members either. \n\nYour wedding is about uniting those people. Both your families. That includes step mom and step sister.  You may not like them. You may not get along. But for one day in your life, family can buck it up and be present, civil, dignified, and witness both if you pledge your union.  One. Freaking. Day. \n\nHonestly, you never even have to see them again. This also includes you as well.\n\nI'm in my 50s. We were high school sweethearts who got united. We have 4 children between us. 2 are mine, now adults.  So my voice is of a different generation. \n\n I would feel horrified if my kid said I could attend their wedding but not my partner. My partner, who I also chose to be my life's journey companion, and has supported me on good days, bad, while sick, working together a team, cooking cleaning,  laundry,  being each other's support system, our counselors, being our shoulder and rock, and has been there every step of the way? I could not have done this without him. Being present, has shaped me to be who I am today. We are here, and together...a miracle in itself. All love is. Relationships are not easy.  It takes work! \n\nI would feel very dishonoured in my kid not inviting my spouse. Or if my step kids decided on not inviting me. I mean, wouldn't you want your parent loved by someone, not alone, sharing their life and working together with someone for a purpose?  Just massive disrespect. Your dad chose his partner that he thought best for him. Not your choice.\n\nBuck it up. One day.\n\nIf someone is apt to having tantrums or making a scene,  then that would be different but due to no context as why you don't get along, I wouldn't know. But don't invite these people, family or not. You want your day to go perfect.\n\nGood luck with your wedding day.", "YTA, not wanting them there is not the many issue here but the fact you did it in card. You need to grow up and talk to you dad especially about something as serious as this will become. I would not be surprised if this caused a major issue in your family.
