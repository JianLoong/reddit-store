Waitress comes back to our table with our drinks and we start to order. I order my entree, and then he proceeds to order a few appetizers and one of the most expensive items on the menu plus sides. I'm a bit wide eyed at this, the waitress kinda gives him some side eye but writes it down. Maybe I've been on reddit too much but a red flag warning flares in my brain and I blurt out \"could we do two separate checks?\"\n\nWaitress says \"sure -- that's not a problem\" and goes to put our order in. Guy is sitting across from me red faced, says \"why separate checks? didn't you hear what I said? I wanted to treat you tonight.\" I realize I really don't have a good reason for it without outright shitting on his character so I say \"I appreciate that you wanted to do that for me -- I feel more comfortable paying for my entree.\" He kind of mumbled a fine, excused himself from the table for a bit, came back and the rest of dinner was incredibly awkward (complete 180 from our first two dates).

Our first two dates were very inexpensive. The dinner was a surprise based on his comments previously.\n\n\\- Its not how much he ordered or what specifically he ordered, but the cost alone -- it was well over $200 and it made me uncomfortable.\n\n\\- I didn't know the restaurant, and didn't have time to look it up ahead of time so I wasn't aware of the cost until I sat down.\n\n\\- Paranoia came from a TedTalk I had watched, plus some major anxiety around dining/money that I have.\n\nI accept that I was an asshole for how I did this (I should have brought it up when I first realized the prices on the menu at minimum and not when the waitress was there especially if it made me uncomfortable) and will be sending him an apology once it's more into the morning.", "created_utc": 1678363369, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mqg26/aita_for_asking_to_split_the_check/", "score": 373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would have been more appropriate after the waitress left to say something like \u2018Hey, this place is pricier than I anticipated, are you sure you\u2019re ok with picking up the whole tab because I have no problem with paying for myself\u2019.  Instead, by doing it in the middle of ordering could have made him think that you absolutely weren\u2019t interested since he already said he would treat, and that most likely led to the awkwardness. \n\nNAH, but as others have mentioned, life doesn\u2019t always imitate TikTokss or TedTalks or Instagram. \n\nThere were many other more constructive ways this could have been handled instead of embarrassing someone for no real discernible reason.", "YTA- he offered to pay for dinner and you accepted the offer but in front of the server changed your mind without warning. That was very rude and dismissive.\n\nNot sure why his ordering was red flags to you.

I\u2019ve literally had guys order more food and more expensive foods while on dates and have never batted an eyelid. Seems like you have some insecurities or anxiety (which is fine, we all do) when it comes to money and dating.", "So there's nothing wrong about requesting you pay for your own meal, but I'm a bit baffled as to why - and what on earth is your problem with his \"ordering habits\"? Was it the quantity? The price?\n\nSome people like to splurge every now and then, and it doesn't sound like he was expecting you to pay for anything, let alone his expensive choices. He was maybe trying to show off a little (e.g., look at how much I can spend!)?\n\nOverall, I can't call anyone here an asshole, it's just an odd thing for you to make an issue about.", "Nah\n\nHe might be frugal but this may have been the thing he was going to splurge on - I see no red flags in someone ordering for themselves (when they\u2019re paying) a pricey meal.  \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong Persay and not maliciously (hence not an ah) but it was rude imo", "NAH.  From your perspective, I totally understand why you would want to pay for your own meal. Way too many guys out there buying women drinks or meals then acting like they\u2019re entitled to sex because she \u201cowes him.\u201d \n\nFrom his perspective though, you two talked about it before hand, he was going to treat you. You not only deviated from that plan suddenly and without discussion, but did it in a way that strongly implies you don\u2019t trust him (which is fine, you don\u2019t have to, but being that obvious about it is rude). If you wanted to pay for your own meal, the time to say that would have been when he said he wanted to treat you to dinner. I would also probably lose interest in a woman who did this. It speaks to an inability to have awkward conversations in a mature way.", "YTA for assuming anything because of his totally normal order. Maybe he WANTED the surf and turf with a baked potato and creamed spinach (or whatever)? No idea why you'd go on a date with someone you're afraid would stick you with the check, you should have either declined, suggested a less expensive place or made your wish of going dutch up front. You did shit all over him at the table.", "NAH\n\nIt's fine you wanted to pay your own way, but he wanted to treat you and you didn't let him.\n\nI doubt the waitress gave him any side eye, if it's an upscale place she's used to people ordering food. The restaurant wouldn't exist if people always came in and ordered minimally. \n\nMaybe in the future if you're not comfortable going to expensive places with newer dates why don't you start your first few dates getting coffee/lunch not going to super expensive places? This guy probably won't call you back because while you didn't do anything necessarily wrong it was really off putting the way you handled it.", "NTA. Even if he 100% intended on paying for you both, it wouldn\u2019t be an AN move to ask to split the check nonetheless. You may not get another date after that, but setting boundaries (especially in the early stages of dating) is never an AH move. You got to see him when he didn\u2019t get his way, and turns out, he doesn\u2019t react well when he doesn\u2019t get his way. Sounds like you dodged a bullet either way.", "I'm gonna have to say a soft YTA. I get that some people get scammed, and it sucks, but if you go your whole life with the first instinct to avoid scams you're never going to be able to trust anyone new ever. Unfortunately this is the consequence, now a guy who most likely *did* want to treat you (especially after 3 dates) now thinks that you don't want that, and probably was able to tell why. \n\nIf he's saving up for a house, that's fine to be wary, but $300 isn't really gonna make or break a down payment so it's not really a red flag. I doubt he'll call again, but if he does hold onto him with everything you've got lol", "I think NAH. It's a shame that your gut seemed to be wrong this time and has (rightfully so) put him off, but on the other hand if you had come here with the same story but it had turned out that he did stick you with the bill then people would be telling you to trust your instincts.\n\nI would just take this and learn from it, and maybe agree not to go anywhere too fancy in the future until you have a bit more trust in the person you're dating.", "I really don\u2019t get why it\u2019s a big deal. The whole point of treating someone is for them to enjoy it, and if you weren\u2019t comfortable then that defeats the purpose. I\u2019d have insisted again when the bill came, but kept the vibe pretty positive regardless.", "This is a tough call.\n\nYou're treating him as though he's dishonest. He was clear in his intention. \n\nSaving up to buy a house can mean he doesn't go out often. When he does, he goes all out. He was probably looking forward to it. \n\nSo...you're a little bit of TA for treating him as tho he's an A. You should apologize. Hopefully he can understand you were acting out of some kind of anxiety and not that you truly thought he was going to ghost you with the bill unless you really think that. \n\nIf you like him. Maybe you just don't like him that much.", "NAH. You can pay for your own meal if you want. However, your date told you he wanted to treat you & he probably read your actions correctly- that you don\u2019t trust him & were afraid he was going to stick you with the check. It\u2019s very off putting to be told that someone thinks of you as a liar & a cheat. I don\u2019t think there will be another date.", "NTA - this was the 3rd date (known in some archaic circles as the \"sex date\").  He was spending some obvious money, something that didn't align with his prior behavior and goals of saving money.  He was spending money expecting something in return.  OP noticed and it made her uncomfortable.  I would have felt uncomfortable too.  Like I was being bought.  ewww.", "YTA, although I guess he could've been clearer that 'I'm going to treat you' means that he'll pay.\n\nNot sure why this would be a red flag in the first place?", "NAH. He behaved in a way that was out of character based on your previous interactions and it set off alarm bells. There\u2019s nothing wrong with trusting your gut.", "The only red flag I see is you losing yourself. His goals which he can manage, you made about you. He bought you out to eat. He ordered food and you went batty but I'm trying to figure out why.", "NTA but his behaviour afterwards is a red flag.", "I don\u2019t understand what the red flag was? Why was him ordering a lot of food a panic moment where you then decided you needed to pay for you own meal? I\u2019m struggling getting from point A to B here", "Congratulations on being uncomfortable with how somebody else spends their money. You didn't seem to have a problem with it when he was \"treating you\". No wonder he has been distant since, you made a fuss out of a situation that you knew was already coming. He told you in advance he was going to treat you. You showed up and made a fuss, instead of telling him beforehand you don't want to be treated. Very strange behaviour.\n\nYTA", "YTA.", "YTA, that was weird.

It seems like you panicked, which is fair. But to him it probably signaled that you aren\u2019t interested in him. \n\nI\u2019ve had guys over-order, pay, and then use it later in the evening as a \u201cwell you owe me now, I spent $200 on dinner\u201d so I get your apprehension.

It\u2019s never wrong to split the check if you\u2019re more comfortable with that. It\u2019s only a third date and you don\u2019t know yet what he thought an expensive dinner would mean for your relationship. Are there strings attached? Does he feel this gives him power over you?\n\nHe wanted to treat, but you should prioritize your comfort. If he can\u2019t handle that, it is better to know now.", "NTA\n\nObviously the \"woops i forgot my wallet excuse\" and the \"i bought you dinner what do you mean we cant have sex\" flags are waving in my head, also the \"look how rich i am i can afford the most expensive things doesnt that make you want me\" \n\nYou should have set a clearer boundary before dinner though. Its not an ah move, he just wasnt able to show off or do whatever game he was planning. The rational response is \"oh okay, if thats what youd prefer\" \n\nHis response makes me thing this was an ego thing. I dont like those games. Its sad.", "I will not sat ah or not. \n\nBut why did you accept a dinner that he said he would pay for if you had no intention of letting him pay?   Why did you ambush him at the restaurant like that and not tell him that you didn't want him to pay when he asked you to go out?", "NTA. You hardly know this person. And you didn't do anything rude or strange, you simply paid for your own meal. Nothing wrong with that.

It's good to trust your gut, and considering your comment that  he had mentioned wanting to save money vs his behaviour (idk i can understand being a little disappointed or hurt if my date wanted to split checks after i said i would pay, but getting that upset?? kinda weird to me) . \n\nEveryone telling you to \"go to therapy\" for this need to go touch some grass either way", "YTA.

Though I'm hoping I'm wrong about that, as it would be a very stupid reason.", "So I\u2019m fairly frugal myself especially when it comes to dating, but I enjoy eating out and like good food. \nFor a first few dates as I\u2019m getting to know someone and learn more about them , I\u2019m very frugal but I pick something that\u2019s nice typically but maybe 25 a person with some alcohol.\n\nOnce I can see things lasting longer than 1-2 more dates, I don\u2019t mind splurging on food. \n\nEarly dates being cheap, isn\u2019t necessarily a sign of being cheap, just that the cost of learning about someone shouldn\u2019t be expensive. \n\nIf someone says \u201cI\u2019m treating\u201d \nAnd you\u2019re concerned about their behavior, you ask \n\u201cAre you sure? That\u2019s pricy for your goals\u201d \nYou don\u2019t say \u201cI want separate checks\u201d \nYou could\u2019ve said \u201cwell then next time I\u2019ll get the check\u201d \n\nYta", "I am not. If you can\u2019t afford to pay for the bill yourself, you should not go, regardless of who is inviting you. Shit happens, what if that person forgets their wallet? It\u2019s really nonsensical to be risking homelessness over that.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary AH move to ask to split the bill. It is not. Have op said to the guy \u201cim more comfortable splitting\u201d or \u201cthis restaurant is expensive I really insist we split\u201d she would be totally within her right. \n\nBut in this specific situation op acted like an asshole, because she didn\u2019t communicate to her date, she agreed to one thing and acted completely differently therefore completely removing the date\u2019s agency in the matter. That\u2019s the problem.", "She had many opportunities to handle it like an adult. She chose not to. This is a red flag, much more so than ordering steak.", "That\u2019s exactly what I am saying though. I would not go to a restaurant no matter who is paying if I only have $199 to my name. That\u2019s just not worth the risk", "I can say a lot of things and then not go through with it. Why not clear it up after she asked for split bill and explain: oh i wanted to pay this time.", "Um, because that's none of her business.", "She met a guy 3 times. He is a grown adult, fully capable (probably) of managing the burden of $200 restaurant bill.\n\nIf my date was assuming i can\u2019t handle financial responsibility of $200 based on absolutely nothing, I too would be offended.\n\nWhy is it so unreasonable to people that someone would once splurge on a meal they offered to fully pay for? Even if they are frugal (which the post has no indication of).\n\nAgain, the guy offered to pay for dinner, she agreed. And then she asked for a separate check without mentioning anything to him. It is controlling.", "I don\u2019t know if she actually said to him that she has a problem with what he ordered.\nBut she agreed it was his treat, and after he ordered she told the waiter (not the guy) she wants separate checks.\nI can see why the guy would feel weird. He invited her to dinner and she agreed, but then blindsided him. And her justification is \u201che ordered something too expensive\u201d. Which is like\u2026 girl, he said he is paying though, probably for that reason", "She didn't lol", "All she did was change her mind and decide to pay for her own meal. I really don't understand why anyone would be offended by that?", "You aren't reading anything other say. She was scared sed be footed with the bill. Which happens to way too many people. Heck it happened to me when I was dating. I.got invited on their dime and then the wallet was missing.", "She didn't assume he couldn't pay, she made it clear *she wasn't going to!* That's the part you're trying so hard to ignore.", "Blindsided him with deciding to pay for her own food? Again, not really seeing what makes this fundamentally rude.", "But why didn\u2019t she tell him that? Because she agreed he\u2019d pay. It\u2019s fair she changed her mind. \nHowever, instead of blindsiding him and telling the waiter, she could have said something to him. \n\nHow she handled is rather rude. From his perspective he didn\u2019t do anything wrong to make her want to ask for a separate check, so it is fair that he is confused and put off\n\nIt\u2019s not about changing the mind or the bill splitting, it\u2019s about having no consideration for the person you\u2019re on the date with. All she had to do is communicate."]}
