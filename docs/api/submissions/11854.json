First time we're going out to dinner (his suggestion -- picked the place and wanted to \"treat me\"). It's not a cheap place by any stretch.\n\nWe get there, are making small talk and looking at the menu. I am hungry and decide on an entree. Ask him what he's ordering and he's \"undecided\". Waitress comes back to our table with our drinks and we start to order. I order my entree, and then he proceeds to order a few appetizers and one of the most expensive items on the menu plus sides. I'm a bit wide eyed at this, the waitress kinda gives him some side eye but writes it down. Maybe I've been on reddit too much but a red flag warning flares in my brain and I blurt out \"could we do two separate checks?\"\n\nWaitress says \"sure -- that's not a problem\" and goes to put our order in. Guy is sitting across from me red faced, says \"why separate checks? didn't you hear what I said? I wanted to treat you tonight.\" I realize I really don't have a good reason for it without outright shitting on his character so I say \"I appreciate that you wanted to do that for me -- I feel more comfortable paying for my entree.\" He kind of mumbled a fine, excused himself from the table for a bit, came back and the rest of dinner was incredibly awkward (complete 180 from our first two dates). End of the night comes and he hardly even says good night before he's off into the night.\n\nMy friend group laughed at me and couldn't believe I did that. Notable comment was \"Dude was going to buy you a nice dinner and you basically shat on him at the table.\" I still view his ordering habits as a red flag but since not a single person in that friend chat said I wasn't an asshole...aita for asking to split the check?\n\nUpdating to answer from frequently asked things:\n\n\\- He had stated previous dates that he was being extremely frugal due to some major financial goals he had. Our first two dates were very inexpensive. The dinner was a surprise based on his comments previously.\n\n\\- Its not how much he ordered or what specifically he ordered, but the cost alone -- it was well over $200 and it made me uncomfortable.\n\n\\- I didn't know the restaurant, and didn't have time to look it up ahead of time so I wasn't aware of the cost until I sat down.\n\n\\- Paranoia came from a TedTalk I had watched, plus some major anxiety around dining/money that I have.\n\nI accept that I was an asshole for how I did this (I should have brought it up when I first realized the prices on the menu at minimum and not when the waitress was there especially if it made me uncomfortable) and will be sending him an apology once it's more into the morning.", "created_utc": 1678363369, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mqg26/aita_for_asking_to_split_the_check/", "score": 2404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Definitely sounds like a too-much-internet-for-you moment.", "A lot of people start with \u2018dating\u2019 with casual dates (you mentioned coffee, hiking/burritos) to see if chemistry is there, and then build up to more intimate/potentially more expensive options.

It would have been more appropriate after the waitress left to say something like \u2018Hey, this place is pricier than I anticipated, are you sure you\u2019re ok with picking up the whole tab because I have no problem with paying for myself\u2019.  Instead, by doing it in the middle of ordering could have made him think that you absolutely weren\u2019t interested since he already said he would treat, and that most likely led to the awkwardness. \n\nNAH, but as others have mentioned, life doesn\u2019t always imitate TikTokss or TedTalks or Instagram. \n\nThere were many other more constructive ways this could have been handled instead of embarrassing someone for no real discernible reason.", "YTA- he offered to pay for dinner and you accepted the offer but in front of the server changed your mind without warning. That was very rude and dismissive.\n\nNot sure why his ordering was red flags to you. But certainly not enough to be so judgmental and rude.", "Why is it a red flag from what he ordered?", "> too much but a red flag warning\n\nWhy?", "I\u2019m on the fence, leaning towards YTA\u2026\n\nMen (+woman, and all beings) are allowed to have savings goals and still spend. I\u2019ve literally had guys order more food and more expensive foods while on dates and have never batted an eyelid. Seems like you have some insecurities or anxiety (which is fine, we all do) when it comes to money and dating.", "So there's nothing wrong about requesting you pay for your own meal, but I'm a bit baffled as to why - and what on earth is your problem with his \"ordering habits\"? Was it the quantity? The price?\n\nSome people like to splurge every now and then, and it doesn't sound like he was expecting you to pay for anything, let alone his expensive choices. He was maybe trying to show off a little (e.g., look at how much I can spend!)?\n\nOverall, I can't call anyone here an asshole, it's just an odd thing for you to make an issue about.", "Nah\n\nHe might be frugal but this may have been the thing he was going to splurge on - I see no red flags in someone ordering for themselves (when they\u2019re paying) a pricey meal.  \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong Persay and not maliciously (hence not an ah) but it was rude imo", "NAH.  From your perspective, I totally understand why you would want to pay for your own meal. Way too many guys out there buying women drinks or meals then acting like they\u2019re entitled to sex because she \u201cowes him.\u201d \n\nFrom his perspective though, you two talked about it before hand, he was going to treat you. You not only deviated from that plan suddenly and without discussion, but did it in a way that strongly implies you don\u2019t trust him (which is fine, you don\u2019t have to, but being that obvious about it is rude). If you wanted to pay for your own meal, the time to say that would have been when he said he wanted to treat you to dinner. I would also probably lose interest in a woman who did this. It speaks to an inability to have awkward conversations in a mature way.", "YTA for assuming anything because of his totally normal order. Maybe he WANTED the surf and turf with a baked potato and creamed spinach (or whatever)? No idea why you'd go on a date with someone you're afraid would stick you with the check, you should have either declined, suggested a less expensive place or made your wish of going dutch up front. You did shit all over him at the table.", "NAH\n\nIt's fine you wanted to pay your own way, but he wanted to treat you and you didn't let him.\n\nI doubt the waitress gave him any side eye, if it's an upscale place she's used to people ordering food. The restaurant wouldn't exist if people always came in and ordered minimally. \n\nMaybe in the future if you're not comfortable going to expensive places with newer dates why don't you start your first few dates getting coffee/lunch not going to super expensive places? This guy probably won't call you back because while you didn't do anything necessarily wrong it was really off putting the way you handled it.", "NTA. Even if he 100% intended on paying for you both, it wouldn\u2019t be an AN move to ask to split the check nonetheless. You may not get another date after that, but setting boundaries (especially in the early stages of dating) is never an AH move. You got to see him when he didn\u2019t get his way, and turns out, he doesn\u2019t react well when he doesn\u2019t get his way. Sounds like you dodged a bullet either way.", "I'm gonna have to say a soft YTA. I get that some people get scammed, and it sucks, but if you go your whole life with the first instinct to avoid scams you're never going to be able to trust anyone new ever. Unfortunately this is the consequence, now a guy who most likely *did* want to treat you (especially after 3 dates) now thinks that you don't want that, and probably was able to tell why. \n\nIf he's saving up for a house, that's fine to be wary, but $300 isn't really gonna make or break a down payment so it's not really a red flag. I doubt he'll call again, but if he does hold onto him with everything you've got lol", "I think NAH. It's a shame that your gut seemed to be wrong this time and has (rightfully so) put him off, but on the other hand if you had come here with the same story but it had turned out that he did stick you with the bill then people would be telling you to trust your instincts.\n\nI would just take this and learn from it, and maybe agree not to go anywhere too fancy in the future until you have a bit more trust in the person you're dating.", "I really don\u2019t get why it\u2019s a big deal. The whole point of treating someone is for them to enjoy it, and if you weren\u2019t comfortable then that defeats the purpose. I\u2019d have insisted again when the bill came, but kept the vibe pretty positive regardless.", "This is a tough call.\n\nYou're treating him as though he's dishonest. He was clear in his intention. \n\nSaving up to buy a house can mean he doesn't go out often. When he does, he goes all out. He was probably looking forward to it. \n\nSo...you're a little bit of TA for treating him as tho he's an A. You should apologize. Hopefully he can understand you were acting out of some kind of anxiety and not that you truly thought he was going to ghost you with the bill unless you really think that. \n\nIf you like him. Maybe you just don't like him that much.", "NAH. You can pay for your own meal if you want. However, your date told you he wanted to treat you & he probably read your actions correctly- that you don\u2019t trust him & were afraid he was going to stick you with the check. It\u2019s very off putting to be told that someone thinks of you as a liar & a cheat. I don\u2019t think there will be another date.", "NTA - this was the 3rd date (known in some archaic circles as the \"sex date\").  He was spending some obvious money, something that didn't align with his prior behavior and goals of saving money.  He was spending money expecting something in return.  OP noticed and it made her uncomfortable.  I would have felt uncomfortable too.  Like I was being bought.  ewww.", "YTA, although I guess he could've been clearer that 'I'm going to treat you' means that he'll pay.\n\nNot sure why this would be a red flag in the first place?", "NAH. He behaved in a way that was out of character based on your previous interactions and it set off alarm bells. There\u2019s nothing wrong with trusting your gut.", "The only red flag I see is you losing yourself. His goals which he can manage, you made about you. He bought you out to eat. He ordered food and you went batty but I'm trying to figure out why.", "NTA but his behaviour afterwards is a red flag.", "I don\u2019t understand what the red flag was? Why was him ordering a lot of food a panic moment where you then decided you needed to pay for you own meal? I\u2019m struggling getting from point A to B here", "Congratulations on being uncomfortable with how somebody else spends their money. You didn't seem to have a problem with it when he was \"treating you\". No wonder he has been distant since, you made a fuss out of a situation that you knew was already coming. He told you in advance he was going to treat you. You showed up and made a fuss, instead of telling him beforehand you don't want to be treated. Very strange behaviour.\n\nYTA", "YTA.", "YTA, that was weird. If you didn't want him to treat you, you could've told him in private instead of blindsiding him in front of the waitress.", "Soft YTA just on how you handled it. It seems like you panicked, which is fair. But to him it probably signaled that you aren\u2019t interested in him. \n\nI\u2019ve had guys over-order, pay, and then use it later in the evening as a \u201cwell you owe me now, I spent $200 on dinner\u201d so I get your apprehension. However, if you\u2019re worried about that, then you either have trust issues or you\u2019ve chosen the wrong guy. \n\nIf you were concerned about him sticking you the bill, then again, you either have trust issues or you\u2019ve chosen the wrong guy.", "NAH.

It\u2019s never wrong to split the check if you\u2019re more comfortable with that. It\u2019s only a third date and you don\u2019t know yet what he thought an expensive dinner would mean for your relationship. Are there strings attached? Does he feel this gives him power over you?\n\nHe wanted to treat, but you should prioritize your comfort. If he can\u2019t handle that, it is better to know now.", "NTA\n\nObviously the \"woops i forgot my wallet excuse\" and the \"i bought you dinner what do you mean we cant have sex\" flags are waving in my head, also the \"look how rich i am i can afford the most expensive things doesnt that make you want me\" \n\nYou should have set a clearer boundary before dinner though. Its not an ah move, he just wasnt able to show off or do whatever game he was planning. The rational response is \"oh okay, if thats what youd prefer\" \n\nHis response makes me thing this was an ego thing. I dont like those games. Its sad.", "I will not sat ah or not. \n\nBut why did you accept a dinner that he said he would pay for if you had no intention of letting him pay?   Why did you ambush him at the restaurant like that and not tell him that you didn't want him to pay when he asked you to go out?", "NTA. You hardly know this person. And you didn't do anything rude or strange, you simply paid for your own meal. Nothing wrong with that. You certainly didn't \"shit on him\".", "He said he was treating you, you just got extra awkward, lol.\n\nYou should apologize, and try to move on, especially if you like him.", "Third date. He was expecting sex and was going to treat you to dinner in anticipation. So by telling him you wanted seperate checks you were saying sex wasn't going to happen. That's why the 180 in personality and the quick goodnight. \n\nNTA", "NTA-NAH depending on if that really was his intention (which we might never know). It's good to trust your gut, and considering your comment that  he had mentioned wanting to save money vs his behaviour (idk i can understand being a little disappointed or hurt if my date wanted to split checks after i said i would pay, but getting that upset?? kinda weird to me) . \n\nEveryone telling you to \"go to therapy\" for this need to go touch some grass either way", "YTA. He used the word treat because the meal was supposed to be a treat for both of you. He ordered apps and the most expensive dish because Mr. Always frugal was treating himself to the kind of stuff he rarely splurges for.", "NAH - I think you've spent too long on the internet but I don't think I entirely blame you and I certainly don't blame him. Don't think there were any real red flags here and maybe give people the benefit of the doubt next time...\n\n~~INFO\" I'm so confused as to your line of reasoning on him treating you and ordering something expensive being a red flag I need clarity as to why?~~", "[removed]", "YTA. He had already said he was treating you, and what he was ordering was irrelevant.

If the first person actually implied that was the case, then THATs the red flag, not choosing a fancy restaurant ordering a pricey menu item. \n\nKeep treating your dates nicely, most won\u2019t take it as a sign you\u2019re a creep. They will think you\u2019re a nice normal guy (which you probably are based on the fact this comment surprised you).", "it is not lol this person is just bonkers", "How did he punish her?  They finished dinner, and it seems he doesn't want to see her again. \n\nAre you saying she is \"entitled\" to something more than that?  Because I feel like if you are...", "She could have also stymied his plan by just not going home with him. No need for the weird dinner shenanigans.", "Lol why is everyone ignoring this?

I'm old.", "Good lord, calm down. She made a mistake and has owned up to it. Why does half of reddit have such a holier-than-thou attitude?", "Either that or \"this dude is nice, has some cash, and this chick has blown her chance, maybe I can get his number.\"", "A majority?

All it takes is for a man to be involved in a story and he's the asshole. Without fail. There was one where the wife was so emotionally and verbally abusive that the husband and kids had to have a secret group text to warn each other when she was on the warpath. This sub decided the husband was the asshole for not managing her moods better. It's just mask off sexism", "Honestly, its advice and judgements given here that probably caused the issue since OP seems to trust reddit. What she doesn't get is that the real world isn't like reddit at all.", "Yep exactly, I've read plenty of stories in other subs of women that split the bill because they're not interested. I've also read tons of stories about how we as men should be the ones to pay, which I don't mind at all, but don't fault me for taking you to a nice dinner and buying a nice meal. I like food!", "I got that or maybe he was trying to stick her with the bill or say he had forgotten his wallet.", "Same here", "Agreed. She has internet brain. My thought was that since he already told her he was paying he was concerned she\u2019d feel weird about ordering extra stuff so he got a bunch of stuff to share. Then she blurted out that she wanted a separate check and he\u2019s stuck with all the apps and sides.", ">Budgeting and being financially disciplined can be a fucking grind and splurging on oneself once in a while can make it bearable toward the end goal. Good on him.", "but there are mutiple awards and 535 upvotes lol. the world is a scary place.", "Agreed. I think his reaction is what really shows what he was intending. If it was truly innocent, he could have laughed it off, said she could get the next one instead, or said something like, \"Okay, but at least let me pay for drinks since I promised you it'd be my treat.\" But the fact that he completely changed his attitude indicates that he had an ulterior plan that she derailed.", "I went on what I thought was just a friendly dinner with a classmate who\u2019d won a few hundred on a lotto ticket. He ordered a $200 bottle of wine, made a big show about ordering fancy items I was reluctant to try.

You underestimate the audacity of flaky dudes.", "Or maybe he's thinking about getting serious with OP and was frugal till he felt more deeply for them.", "It really is impressive the massive leaps in logic people will make just to call someone an AH.

So many people come to this specific subreddit with real world issues and fail to see half these people don\u2019t interact with the real world they have no idea what it\u2019s like.

You call this aggro?\n\n\"I'm picking up that my date isn't in to me/is getting red flags/isn't feeling comfortable, I guess this date probably isn't going to work out let's just get through the night as friends\"\n\n\nSensing when you're not wanted and pulling away is literally the exact opposite of aggro", "[removed]", "The way I read it was that she was worried that at the end of the night he would try to split the bill 50/50 and she would be stuck paying for half his expensive order.

This days, I feel like people are looking for problems and \"red flags\" instead of looking for compatibility.  He shared too much on a first date?  Red flag.
