Also make sure to come to and agreement on what access & visitation you get with your offspring.", "\"you impregnated her\" has the same issue you're complaining about, seems like you're biased against men.\n\nWhy are you attributing blame and if you feel that way why are you shifting it from her to him? \nThe language isn't aggressive and any material you're reading that suggests such a thing is junk that you shouldn't be filling your mind with.", "They're going to be doing nothing other than cashing a check.  There is no door, they just want that money, money, money, money, money.", "He's not fighting. Court ruled that he didn't owe shit anymore.", "It appears that Claire is the main party harassing him for child support. \n\nTherefore, I am curious if Claire and Becca ever chose to get married and if Becca legally adopted the daughter.\n\nIf Becca never adopted her, and Claire and Becca broke up, then Claire may be desperate to maintain a two-income household.", "Again. It\u2019s not a monetary exchange. \n\n> No child support\n\nClearly written in my original comment. All I\u2019m arguing is that if Becca and Claire want help, the only way OP should be expected to help is if he can be in his child\u2019s life. AND if that help is through the child\u2019s time with him.\n\nNot through child support, nor predicating wether or not he gives CS on this.\n\nBut by housing the kid every other week, helping buy clothes and taking care of food when the child is at his place. If OP offers, letting him take care of birthday plannings, or such like. \n\nYou know\u2026 by parenting. If Becca and Claire want help, they\u2019ll get the help of an extra parent or none at all. OP shouldn\u2019t be treated as a bank regardless, and it should be OP and Child\u2019s decision wether or not he parents at all.", "Let the kid have a say. \n\nOP doesn't pay Child Support. They get 50% custody. The adults can work around the wants of the kid. \n\nIf the kid doesn't want to go by dad, then they don't make them. 50% custody is no child support, most of the time. OP can give his kid money if he chooses.\n\n12/13 year olds have it hard, I agree. My father was dead my whole life, then in my mid 30's I found out he wasn't. He found out I existed. At 12/13 when my mother died if I found out that I had a father I'd have wanted the option.\n\nMaybe the OP's kid declines now. They know they have a dad, who at least claims to want to be in their life. If they get older and they change their mind they have options.\n\nWhich up until now they haven't been given.", "Just stop\ud83d\ude44", "This is what happens when you see those stories on the news about a couple enlisting a friend to act as a sperm donor without going through a clinic, then getting child support and the headline says \"sperm donor sued for child support\".\n\nEither Claire or Becca probably don't have a job, and they are having marital problems. If they are living separately from each other then the non-working one probably has no money, so latches onto the idea of child support as a source of income. Its pure greed.", "You just sound like you are scrambling to find a reason to shit on the man", "Okay but in this case she had the right to terminate it and chose not to. He does not. She chose to carry the baby to term."]}
