My mom stayed more or less single, while my bio-father got married. He had no rights to me, paid child support sometimes, and seemingly has no desire to form any connection to me. I've met him once when I was 16 (I'm 30 now). He thought my mom put me up to knocking on his door, when it was actually my idea. My mom tried to talk me out of it. My half-sister says he's actually a pretty good guy, dressed up as Santa for my nieces and nephew, currently has custody of my nephew, that kind of thing. My mom never really bad-mouthed him to me, outside of saying she wasn't for sure if my sister was my only sibling by him, since he \"couldn't keep it in his pants\", but if she hated the guy,  she never let it show to me.\n\nMy sister tells me how much I'm like him. I look like him, and in a lot of ways, I act like him, apparently. Thirty years, I've met the man once, and I look and act like him. I told my mom about this, and get reaction told me it was true, she looks at me and sees shades of him. It honestly kills me inside, because when I met him nearly fifteen years ago, he didn't seem interested at all. What's even worse is that I'm living with/dying from multi-organ failure. There are ways he could get in touch with me, if he wanted. I've put some thought into it, \"put myself in his position\" kind of thoughts, trying to puzzle out why he never tried. I figure either he never wanted to, or now that it's been so long, the shame is too much. Both are honestly kinda soul-crushing.\n\nThere's more I could say, but in typing all that out, I've realized that my situation is very different to your daughter's. I guess what I'm getting at is that who's \"fault\" it was--mom's or dad's--doesn't matter. Growing up feeling unwanted or given up on by a parent sucks. \n\nPlease, if you can help it, don't let your daughter feel that way. If I could ask only one question of my father, it would be, \"Why?\"", "You'll never read this, but perspective here: \n\nI am the product of a similar setup. My dad wanted contact, my mom didn't want him to have it, she wanted child support, he said not without a relationship. \n\nWhen I was 13 and in foster care I reached out. We exchanged a couple of letters.\n\nWhen I was 26 I reached out again. We talked on the phone for months and eventually met. We like each other and got to know each other. There was love in that relationship, but also a lot of anger on my part. Sometimes he wanted to Dad me, and I rejected that categorically. My childhood was long over when he met me. The time when he could have helped make it better was long over too.\n\nHe regretted not being a part of my young life for the rest of his life. He told me once that he wished he'd paid, because he thought he'd have at least known that my pretty bad circumstances were better. He said \"I didn't know how much i'd love you.\" \n\nIt hurt to hear that. I went through some very bad times. Foster Care and dropping out to support myself and giving up on a good college I could have done well in. It felt like he was valuing me as how much he could bond with me and not as how much a child is worth.\n\nOur relationship was never what he wanted it to be because of that. And then I got married and had kids and saw a father being an active father to his kids in my family for the first time in my life. It made me realize all the ways in which my father wanted to claim the name dad and was falling short, but especially the basic showing up for your kids part. I watched my husband treat my father with kindness and respect while explaining to me on on many a dark night that it wasn't my fault that he didn't do anything to make my childhood better. I watched my husband become very frustrated with my father and the way he made suggestions about the way we raised our kids. \n\nMy father died alone. I tried to get out there to see him when the decline happened but he got COVID and then died suddenly just when they thought he was getting better. I am sad I wasn't there but it's also not like my dad died. \n\nAnyway, another perspective. This isn't just about your relationship with the kid's mom's. You wanted a relationship once. I can tell you that as a child of a similar situation, support would not only have been a substantial relationship for me, but also a sustaining one, and it probably would have transformed the relationship we did have.

If not, there would have to be evidence showing that it is in the dependents' best interest to not have the father involved. We've told multiple non-custodial fathers that we're not going to bastardize a child, so us getting involved in a legal/bio scenario (one father is the legal parent per state law, but the mother declares someone else as the alleged father) is pretty much the extent where we'll get involved in disestablishing paternity--dads usually have to file their own motion in court. And considering DCF will send a referral to us if they have a single-parent public assistance case, they're going to require the parent cooperate with us and get support squared away, because Florida is going to want to make sure any possible support is coming from the other parent instead of them, *especially* if TANF comes into play.\n\n\nIt's hard to say because every state's paternity/child support laws are different, but I just have a lot of questions about the specifics in OP's story.", "That's fair.
