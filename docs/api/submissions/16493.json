Saying stuff like 'she got pregnant' is shifting the blame of the pregnancy to the woman.\n\nIt's in the same vein as 'she got  mugged'.  Its shifts the blame from the attacker  to the victim.\n\n   The ex isn't a victim in this scenario but there is equal responsibility for creating a baby.\n\nThere's some really interesting studies on passive aggressive languages and victim blaming.  If sure I can find the titles if you're interested.", "Right but then there would be a court record of OP being asked by Claire for child support, OP saying yes on the condition I get visitation, and then Claire saying no. The court pet is just really to enforce the visitation on the off chance Claire does say yes.", "  OP said he fought for a while (which is a vague statement) before agreeing to give up his parental rights.  The court then ruled that he had no child support obligations because he gave up his rights.  There is nothing in the post to suggest he court terminated his rights over his objection.", "That puts Becca at risk of losing access to her child if she and Claire were to split up.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying there\u2019s a good solution here, the choices everyone (including OP) made 13 years ago have repercussions.  And unfortunately there is a child in the middle of it who had no say in any of it.", "I kind of doubt that it would be that simple, Becca isn\u2019t likely to just be okay with losing those rights.", "Well, if his parental rights weren't terminated, he might be responsible for his role in this situation, but since they were terminated, he has no responsibility in it.", "It's not the best solution, but it's the fairest one if OP is expected to financially support the girl.", "You mean if he hadn\u2019t voluntarily terminated his rights.  OP made that choice, it was not forced on him.  Would it have been hard work to stay in his child\u2019s life?  Sure, it might have been.  But parenting isn\u2019t easy and good parents don\u2019t walk away because it gets hard.", "Hey, I agree that he shouldn't have terminated his rights because his ex told him to. I'm just saying that, by doing so, he has absolved himself of any responsibility for this situation. If he is to accept that responsibility, then he should also get his rights back.", "I agree with you that OP has no legal obligations here.  I just also think he has a greatly overblown sense of his own victimhood."]}
