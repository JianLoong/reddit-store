That's karma, baybee!\" in reality I would urge you to think very carefully on this before you make a decision.\n\nI understand why your mother is upset--you have taken this harder than she presumably has, even though she was the one who was cheated on twice, and who decided to end her marriage over said cheating. She is worried that the petty route will be something that you look back at when you are her age and regret. Not telling him will, most likely, ruin your relationship with him and your step-family--you might not see an issue with that now, but will you see an issue when you have kids and he wants to meet them? Or they want to meet him? What if you stop talking? How old is he? How is his health? Would you regret it if this is the thing that completely estranges you from each other, and then he suddenly passed away? Unexpected heart attack, complications from covid, cancer that went unnoticed too long. If he was suddenly gone forever, would you be able to look back at that time lost, his absence in your life, in your children's lives, and feel nothing about it?\n\nLastly, you hated it when he did this to you, and you know he will probably be devastated of you do it to him. What would actually be more satisfying to you? Getting to tell him that turnabout's fair play after the fact? Or getting to show him, to his face, that you have grown up into a better, more considerate adult than he was for you.\n\nYou don't need him to walk you down the aisle, especially if you have someone in your life who was there for you in a way that your father wasn't who you would rather walk you down the aisle, but you should give him a chance. Sit him down and put it all on the table: tell him that you are getting married, and that you were honestly and truly tempted to do exactly to him what he did to you. That you are still really hurt and bothered by how things shook out, but that you are trying to move past it, but you are having a really hard time considering (insert bullet point list of every major fuck up of his). See how he reacts. If he's defensive or tries to tell you it was forever ago and you should be over it, don't give him that invite! But if he apologises and acknowledges that he has fucked up multiple times on all counts, then that's multiple apologies you deserve to have if you can get them, and you can invite him (and the rest of your step-family as a token of good will that you really do accept those apologies) if you feel good about the outcome. Make it clear that you are not comfortable with him walking you down the aisle if that is true, but also make it clear that you think you would regret not seeing him in your wedding pictures twenty years down the road, and that you really do want him to be there at this very big life changing event.\n\nAnd if he does apologise and seems to mean it, genuinely consider moving past your pasts and repairing your relationship going forward.\n\nI have been in your shoes, and while it wasn't a parent, it was a friend closer than members of my immediate family that did a lot of harm to me that I did not deserve, and did it even though I had only ever been in her corner. I cut her out of my life for years, and then when the rage at the things she had said and done had faded, we both realised we missed each other and reached out to try and at least be peaceful so mutual friends would no longer have to plan events in a way that had them walking on eggshells. This happened right before she was getting married, and while our new friendship was still very cautious, when her cousin/maid of honor threw a tantrum and cancelled the bachelorette party AND bridal shower she'd been planning, I stepped in without being asked and organized and threw both for her. I felt like any hurt she'd caused me in the past was still worth analyzing, but using this opportunity to get a little petty rush because she was sad, though tempting, just wasn't the kind of person I wanted to be. I am a ride or die friend to those who return that kind of loyalty, and I value that in myself. Changing that about myself for a fleeting moment of pretty satisfaction wasn't an option, and I did what I did because I genuinely felt like she deserved that kind of support.\n\nAnd years down the road, our friendship fell apart again because even though I was trying my best, things were still rocky between us at times. When my daughter was born, we opted to make friends who we had grown closer with in the years that we had not been speaking to my ex friend her godparents because we wanted our kid to have people with stability and reliability for godparents, and apparently that was a slight worth blowing up our close childhood friendship over for a second and final time.\n\nAnd even then, I do not regret going out on a limb for her at her wedding, and making those overtures to fix things. I can look back guilt free--I literally brought my best to that friendship, and I will never have to wonder if there was something else I could have done to repair things, or regret that I acted badly when I could have been kind instead. I haven't seen or talked to her in nearly 11 years, and I haven't lost a wink of sleep wondering what would have happened if I didn't just lay out all of my feelings about our friendship for her and the way it had failed, and what would need to change if it was ever going to work. I made those changes, and she did not or could not. There's a finality about the knowledge that I did everything that I could to mend things that provided me with closure more cathartic than any short lived pettiness would have, and I didn't have to stoop to her level to get it. I'm sad that a relationship I put so much work into ran its course and went out in a pretty explosive way, but the knowledge that I DID do that work takes all of the sting of that loss out of it for me, and it might for you, too.", "You act like your dad cheated on you.
