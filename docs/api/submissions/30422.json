The first time was when I was 3 years old and from that infidelity my stepsister was born, the second time was when my mom was pregnant with my little brother when I was 11 years old.\r  \nMy mom found out about his infidelity three years after my little brother was born and kicked him out of the house. When I was little, my dad was what could be considered the best dad in the world since he visited me every day even though we didn't live together and he was always looking out for me but after my mom got pregnant, his attitude changed and he started to put us on the back burner.\r  \n\n\nWhen my dad left home, he would come to visit me and my little brother 2 or 3 times a week. If we were lucky, he would take us out to eat and take us back to our house. He always told us he had no money and didn't want to give more than 325 USD in alimony to my mom.\r  \n\n\nEverything remained the same until two years later, when my mom told me that he was going to marry his mistress. I am not temperamental and I prefer to talk about things so I decided to wait quietly for him to call me to talk and give me an invitation but that never happened. Being close to the date of his wedding, I asked him if we could go to the theater that day and he just told me that he could not because he was going to be busy. I understood that he had no intention of telling me soon; it was about 6 months after his wedding and I decided to ask him directly why he did not tell me that he got married. He nervously told me that he did not know how I would react but that he could introduce us to his wife. I told him that I did want to meet her. I thought he was going to tell me a date and that we were going to be able to talk clearly about it with his wife but I was wrong. My dad decided to introduce her to me on my 18th birthday as a surprise. I was very uncomfortable and so was my brother but none of them said anything. I just knew that was the last straw and I decided that I was not going to invite him to my wedding either.\r  \n\n\nI am now about 4 months away from my wedding to a wonderful man and I am still keeping my word. My mom asked me if my dad was going to walk me down the aisle but I told her that he was not invited. She got angry and said that I could not exclude my dad from such an important event in my life and that I should let that grudge go. She also said that I am not a child anymore. She looked upset so I started to consider whether to tell my dad, but he would still only attend as a guest. My fianc\u00e9 also thinks I am overreacting (he thought that my dad had just abandoned me).\r  \n\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to invite my dad to my wedding?\r", "created_utc": 1699252876, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ows6n/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_my_dad_to_my/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was an AH for 'surprising' you on your birthday with his wife--of many years at that point--who was his mistress and helped break up your parents' marriage.

His bit of showing up and doing part of the dad thing with you doesn't erase all that.\n\nFor lying to your fiance (which you clearly state only in your response to the bot), YTA.

Then he sprung his new wife (former mistress) on you at your birthday - not cool, not kosher, however you want to say it, it was unkind as it put the focus on her, not you, on your birthday  and your 18th birthday at that! I get it - you would be seething with resentment the entire time he walked you down the aisle and this is your wedding day. Who wants to seethe on that special day? Same thing with inviting him, only do it if it feels comfortable, other wise, don't do it. Your mom is wrong, you can exclude him from such an important event in your life.
