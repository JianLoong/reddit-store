If they are free to come with their hands swinging empty then you are free to refuse to cook an entire meal when all you agreed to was 2 turkeys.", "NTA. Do not let these people take advantage of your good will. You've already been generous enough volunteering to do **two** turkeys for 30 people! And you're not even the host! These people reek of entitlement.", "NTA but this is a classic type of aita post that is going to be rife with bad advice.\n\nNo reasonable person is going to think you're the asshole in this situation but what comes next?\n\nA bunch of Internet strangers determined that you're right, but now what?\n\nYou can't hide out in this coffee shop forever and eventually when you go home to cook your wife will be there to pick up the argument right where you left off.\n\nMy point is being \"right\" frequently doesn't matter that much if the cost of being right is more fighting, acrimony, and hurt feelings.\n\nI'm not saying that you should completely give in, your inlaws are being unreasonable and your wife should have your back instead of just signing you up for more cooking, but I don't know if this is the hill you really want to die on.", "NTA A pot roast? Sting beans and potatoes? A cake? All in addition to two turkeys? Oh hell, no, you're not the asshole and your mother in law is out of her mind. She invited 3O people to her home for a pot luck and that's her problem. She can grab a ham, roast potatoes and a bag of green beans from any grocery store. I'd show up with a two turkeys and a pot of chili with beans out of spite! It's got beef and beans in it, close enough.", "NTA. It is quite presumptuous to casually ask someone to cook an additional pot roast and cake, not to mention the potatoes and green beans.", "NTA Why did you accept to cook the turkey? The hardest thing and you are not even hosting? Guests doing pot luck should be doing the smaller dishes not the turkey itself.\n\nAbsolutely do not cook more. They can make all that tomorrow morning - dont they have the day off. Or buy some. Dont give in.", "NTA the expense and time for what they are asking is ridiculous.  Tell them life happened and you can't.  Not to mention,  the short notice", "Well maybe life will come up for you too and you won\u2019t be able to cook the turkeys. NTA!", "NTA cooking 2 turkeys is already a lit of cooking and money asking for more is not on.  Your right the ppl who say they don't have time to cook can buy somthing rather than trying to stick you with everything", "NTA! At all! The family is looking a bit A\u00a4-ley though! A potluck is designed to make it easier for the host and guests. This was planned and agreed upon ahead of time. If your wife was okay volunteering you for extra work, she may as well help contribute to help relieve the extra work load. You were not wrong in suggesting they buy a precooked dish.", "NTA, she wrote a cheque she expected your ass to cash. So sweetie can either get very busy cooking or she can ring up her family and admit she was happy to sacrifice you to please them.", "NTA.\n\nIf she was gonna ask, it should have been only one thing.  Not a whole dang list.  You're not the one hosting!", "NTA. lol what???? Deeply unreasonable. If you're short on food that's the hosts (aka your in-laws) problem.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s a huge ask. Especially since you\u2019d be doing it all by yourself. And like.,.how many ovens or roasters do you have? Because two birds would leave me without oven space to make a damned cake. That\u2019s something I\u2019d do a day before.", "It's going to suck bad for them when you don't show up with turkeys. Your wife should have refused instead of putting it all on you.\nNTA.  Good luck.", "NTA. They are asking for you to become their free personal chef. It is one thing to ask someone to bring rolls or an salad, not a pot roast!", "NTA, your wife and her parents are the a$$holes.", "NTA this is not your responsibility your MIL is the AH for accepting that people won't be bringing food and then when she is the host trying to make it your problem. Also those other people are AH too for lacking commitment. Hope you can still enjoy your thanksgiving.", "NTA The whole thing is unreasonable. I\u2019d like your suggestion with restaurant food. Life happens sure. For everybody. They can figure it out.", ">10 minutes ago her parents called and said some people said they can\u2019t cook their promised dishes and if I could cook more.   \n>  \n>I refused and before we could argue, I left\n\nThat was the right move since she's refusing to talk turkey with the guests who bailed on their responsibilities. \n\n**NTA**", "NTA - if they wanted your \"famous\" side dish, that should have been requested in advance.  Having you cook four additional items 24 hours before Thanksgiving is ridiculous.", "NTA. You made a good decision by setting the boundary and removing yourself from the situation while they figure out a more reasonable plan OP.", "NTA -\n\nThat's another main course, 2 sides, and dessert.  That's most likely a trip to the store for ingredients,  plus a huge time commit.  And all at the last minute. \n\nI suggest telling your wife quickly, because your in-laws are likely to blow this out of proportion.  Good luck, OP!", "Info: Can we have the famous green bean recipe? Pleeeaasssee!!! I understand if it is sacred and not shared with others. No pressure.", "Your in-laws decide to outsource the entire meal to you? Guess Thanksgiving is at your house this year instead because they sure aren't hosting.\n\nNTA. This is clearly insane. Your wife needs to learn how to draw boundaries with her family. And if she can't do that, she can cook those things herself.", "NTA.  Your in-laws are hosting, they should be the ones cooking more.", "NTA- why would your in-laws get credit for hosting if you\u2019re providing the whole meal? It\u2019s really rude to invite a guest to your home, then demand they provide food for 30 people, so they\u2019re definitely the A H\u2019s", "NTA. Just having to go for groceries the day before Thanksgiving is hell.", "NTA\n\nYou can't even cook turkeys, pot roast and a cake in the same oven at the same time.  People who promised to bring something can go to the store today and buy something to bring.", "NTA.\n\nI MIGHT (note, only \"might\") understand one side dish in very extenuating circumstances (e.g. someone got sick/injured badly enough), but it is not a potluck anymore if half of the pot (or more) is brought by one guest (and not organizers).", "NTA. I wouldn't even go, I'd keep all the turkey. You can freeze it and use it for turkey noodle soup, sandwiches, chili, whatever.", "NTA \n\nYou aren't hosting, so it's not your problem. \n\nHer parent must know how to make potatoes, cook a boxed cake mix and buy some vegetables. You're already cooking 2 turkeys. Don't give in to this.", "Ohh hahah yeah no way. No way. They can\u2019t be that entitled. NTA. Let your in laws call these dumbasses and get them to cook their promised meals or get something from the store/ restaurant. Or stay home. Ridiculous.\n\nYour wife is TA for not supporting you and letting your in-laws bully you", "NTA", "NTA. Potluck means that each person brings something so that no one has to do a lot. They\u2019re asking you to do a lot, plus the meat is a very expensive part of the meal.", "\u201cLife came up.\u201d \u201cPeople are lazy\u201d is more accurate. \n\nWere they so busy they were just going to go hungry? Unlikely. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your wife is extremely inconsiderate and it doesn't sound like she appreciates you.", "NTA\n\nThat's a huge and completely ridiculous thing to ask, and on such short notice and not to mention expensive for you. Like you said, people can bring restaurant food, or something ready made that just needs to be popped in the microwave or something.", "The were the AH as soon as they asked you to provide the turkey, let alone 2! The rest is just the icing on the AH cake. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA You're already doing the main dish and centerpiece of the meal, that's plenty. Other people's failure to plan does not constitute an emergency on your part.", "Your suggestion for them to buy from restaurants and bring was a good one. Or they can figure it out. The \"life came up\" bit and then saying you have all day to cook, so might as well pick up the slack, makes it seem like your time is less important. I'd feel taken for granted there. And especially from someone who doesn't even like to cook. Unless there are actual emergencies, and even then, your in-laws as the hosts, should be the ones to cover for their guests and not you. Or your wife can get over her dislike of cooking instead of volunteering your services. NTA. Not even a little. But your wife is. Her parents too. \n\nEdited.", "NTA. The in laws sure are tho.", "NTA.  At this point, I would strongly be considering telling her \u201clife came up\u201d and letting her figure out her own dang turkey.  (A pot roast?!  Why the heck does she need a whole other main meat dish?)", "Haha! \"LIFE HAPPENED\"?! Are they insinuating that you don't have one and therefore can be the kitchen slave? \n\nNTA but time to have a serious talk with your spouse about what just happened and why she thought this should be okay for you to do.", "NTA. Do what you agreed, if you have time and energy and resources, then do a little more. Myself, I'd bring a cake, but I love baking. Don't stress yourself out to make other people's lives easier.", "NTA.  You are already bringing two turkeys.   If there are 30 people, someone else can bring something.  You can\u2019t be expected to also bake a cake right now.  Someone else needs to step up. Your wife can put a cake together even if she\u2019s not a cook.", "NTA. I love when people are like 'we will host and btw everything has to be homemade but by host we just mean it will be at our house and we plan to do absolutely nothing else.'\n\nHow do people not know how hard it is to time and cook all of that? Geez!", "Oh hell no you are NTA.\n\nI am being invited over to a friend\u2019s for Thanksgiving and all they asked me was to bring a pumpkin pie. That\u2019s it. They don\u2019t care if it\u2019s store bought. The same logic applies here. You are already making two turkeys. If they want you to make more then you should be hosting or they need to pay you big time for such short notice. Your wife is TA though for not sticking by you.", "NTA The last minute add on of 4 dishes on top of the two turkeys you committed to cook is too much. Very unreasonable to expect you to pick up everybody else's slack and/or poor planning. How many ovens do they think you have available anyhow?", "NTA. You're already doing so much, and you didn't prep to do the entire meal. I could see you taking one or two more items, but not all of them.", "Which likely already cost 50-100 dollars depending if they bought it fresh or frozen  and size. They\u2019re asking him to spend at least another 100 for these other dishes.", "Well idk if it\u2019s OP\u2019s in-laws being unreasonable or their wife but honestly with 2 turkeys already on their list I think everyone will be fine without the rest of the dishes, and if not they can order pizza or something. \n\nThis would be my hill to die on. It\u2019s a lot to ask of a partner without double-checking it\u2019s okay. If people ask what happened, OP can say wife didn\u2019t clear it with them and they were unable to do more than already agreed to. Wife and in-laws will learn to ask rather than volun-tell in the future. It\u2019s a necessary lesson unless OP wants this to continue.", "Can of chili.", "I\u2019ve done pot luck thanksgiving. it always is with my family actually but the host usually provides the main dish. And everyone else brings a side.", "But OP has a whole day to cook it! /S. That is insane. Do they think OP has like 4 ovens in there house? How else could he make 2 turkeys, a pot roast, a cake, potatoes, all at once? Not even feasible, even constantly shuffling it in and out, while prepping green beans, and the frosting for the cake, etc. \n\nEntitled and spoiled of them. Life can just come up for everyone else but OP I guess."]}
