My wife spoke with her family then told me that we\u2019ll be bringing the turkey. I\u2019m okay with it and I asked how many people are coming so I\u2019ll know how much to cook. After some discussions, I found out that there will be about 30 people but not everyone like turkey so we settled on me cooking 2 turkeys. Other people will bring other meaty dishes.\n\nI bought the turkeys, ingredients, and made preparations to cook the turkeys tomorrow morning in time for dinner. 10 minutes ago her parents called and said some people said they can\u2019t cook their promised dishes and if I could cook more. She gave me a list:\n\n1. Pot roast\n2. Potato dish\n3. My famous stir fried green beans\n4. A cake \n\nI looked at the list, looked at her, looked at the list again, and said no. At this point, they\u2019re basically asking me to cook an entire meal. I asked if they\u2019re short on dishes because people are not coming. She answered that people are still coming but life came up and they couldn\u2019t cook. I asked what came up but she doesn\u2019t know.

My stir fried green beans recipe is easy:\nA. Prep them then dry them\nB. Microwave them in an uncovered bowl for 1 min on high\nC. Heat up the pan on high heat and lightly oil it\nD. Prepare seasoning: salt, pepper, as much garlic as you like, soy sauce, and sesame oil\nE. Once the pan is hot, toss in the green beans to lightly sear it but not cook\nF.

Super inconsiderate of them. If you were doing like a side casserole and they asked you to do another side or 2, ok. But to ask the guy doing 2 whole ass turkeys to on short notice cater an entire 4 course meal with dessert for 30 people, the day before thanksgiving, man that pisses me off that they even have the audacity to ask.

If the other people are coming to a potluck without bringing any food, that's super AH behavior. It is very easy to pick something up if you cannot make it yourself. It is in no way your responsibility to take on their labor AND the cost of their food. Also, it seems the people NOT cooking the turkey are seriously underestimating the amount of work/time it takes to prepare them.", "NTA. It\u2019s rude AF to show up to a potluck empty handed.

I presume instant mashed potatoes is not acceptable?\n\nFamous stir fried green beans sound yummy, would you share the recipe?\n\nCake takes a whole damn day by itself! I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t say you had to make the cake turkey shaped. If they want you to do a turkey shaped cake you should do it shaped like the country Turkey. \n\nIn most of America people do turkey in the oven. Pot roast has to be done in the oven. Mashed potatoes can be done on the stove but for good roasted potatoes you also need to use the oven. Stir fried green beans are on the stove. Cake uses the oven!\n\nSo **bare minimum** you would need four ovens. Five if you do roasted potatoes the turkeys and pot roast *have* to be cooked the day of thanksgiving. \n\n**How do they expect this to happen logistically?**", "NTA, however your wife is TA but not backing you and enforcing boundaries on her parents.\n\nYour in-laws are TA for allowing people to come to a potluck empty handed because \"life\" came up, and dumping everything on you. \n\nOptions: just do the turkeys and go with just them. Deal with the fallout.\nSkip this year. Cook for yourself and enjoy.\n\nI'd choose the second option. But petty revenge sounds good too!", "NTA at all! If your inlaws want all that, offer them the name of a good caterer,  and call it a day. The audacity of your wife and her parents to assume that you would be willing to put in that much work,  probably without your no-cooking ass wife, for them to take all the credit. Plus , who's supposed to pay for all that? The nerve!!", "Sounds like they tried to stick you with all the most expensive dishes too -- two turkeys, and now a pot roast?! As a vegetarian I don't have a clear idea of how much meat costs these days, but I'm pretty sure pot roasts are pricey? At least for a large crowd.\n    \nThey can easily pick up a store-made cake and a potato side if they are must haves. I'd stick with just the promised turkeys, or back out altogether if they keep pushing it.", " NTA but honestly I don\u2019t think you should go.

That being said, you need to let your wife know that this was an exception and will not be the rule for future family gatherings.  Start out where you want to finish.", "NTA but those who decided life prevents them from doing their part are. I\u2019m cooking thanksgiving dinner for 9-14 people by myself. Already working on it right now. We are just barely fully recovered from a horrible flu and we contemplated eating out for thanksgiving rather than cooking but I decided my kids should have their normal thanksgiving they\u2019re looking forward to.", "Same. This reminds me of my in-laws, right down to the part where we pick up the tab.", "i never do a turkey. i make a prime rib roast because honestly it's easier to prepare and a lot less tricky. every time i try to cook a turkey it's dry and terrible.\n\nnobody has complained since i switched three years ago, and when they ask me to cook something else i show them the receipt for an 18 pound prime grade standing rib roast and they stfu.", "The last time I can remember making anything for a potluck (as opposed to store bought or take out) was in 2014. Nobody ever complained, a few times the dish I bought was the absolute favourite.", "I hope you know you are a very kind person. You absolutely were NTA for refusing but you decided that you had the means to do it and made the food anyway.", "NTA Your in laws should make you an aluminum foil crown, sword, and shield and declare you the hero of thanksgiving for picking up all this slack. You also deserve the first slice of pie. I hope everyone appreciates your contributions to making the holiday a success.", "That\u2019s so rude of them coming with nothing. What\u2019s this ? Charity homeless event ?", "NTA, and I\u2019m going to try that green beans recipe :)", "NTA and after the edits it\u2019s clear your big and generous heart is very impressive.\n\nNow\u2019s the time to plants the seeds that next year will not be a repeat performance!", "I understand that you gave in rather than pick a last minute fight and that was very mature of you. However, your wife is being a bad wife and at some point you need to address it and set boundaries for the future.", "Sounds like he\u2019s doing it for the sake of his parents-in-law and his wife. \n\nProbably doesn\u2019t want to ruin Thanksgiving for them. I think it\u2019s really admirable. Absolutely not necessary, but admirable.", "Must be nice having all that money", "It reminds me of my aunt and uncle and their shitty kids (my cousins). 4 boys, all married, most with kids, and there have been FOUR Thanksgivings where my aunt and uncle have been coerced into hosting. All my cousins always pick something to bring (never anything like chips, rolls, or cranberry sauce, oh no, they always pick the major dishes). Aunt and Uncle are on a strict budget like OPs inlaws. Every Thanksgiving this has happened, without fail, my cousins pop up like whack a mole anywhere from 1-3 days ahead of Thanksgiving with excuses about why they can't bring anything (or day of, why not just show up empty handed instead of with the ham you said you'd bring!). \n\nAt this point I just take note of what they've agreed to, and bring an extra dish or two so things turn out okay, because I do love my aunt and uncle and they're the ones who end up suffering \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I can kind of see why OP isn't opting to die on this hill. \n\nCousins do *not* under any circumstances leave the house with leftovers though, over my dead body do they get to profit from their shittiness lol"]}
