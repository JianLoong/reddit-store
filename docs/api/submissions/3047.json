My wife really doesn\u2019t like to cook so in our marriage, I do most of the cooking. So when her parents announced a month ago that their thanksgiving will be potluck, I knew I was in for the cooking duty. My wife spoke with her family then told me that we\u2019ll be bringing the turkey. I\u2019m okay with it and I asked how many people are coming so I\u2019ll know how much to cook. After some discussions, I found out that there will be about 30 people but not everyone like turkey so we settled on me cooking 2 turkeys. Other people will bring other meaty dishes.\n\nI bought the turkeys, ingredients, and made preparations to cook the turkeys tomorrow morning in time for dinner. 10 minutes ago her parents called and said some people said they can\u2019t cook their promised dishes and if I could cook more. She gave me a list:\n\n1. Pot roast\n2. Potato dish\n3. My famous stir fried green beans\n4. A cake \n\nI looked at the list, looked at her, looked at the list again, and said no. At this point, they\u2019re basically asking me to cook an entire meal. I asked if they\u2019re short on dishes because people are not coming. She answered that people are still coming but life came up and they couldn\u2019t cook. I asked what came up but she doesn\u2019t know. I told her if they\u2019re coming, they can buy restaurant dishes to bring. She said I have all day to prepare and I\u2019m cooking tomorrow anyway. \n\nI refused and before we could argue, I left and am sitting at the coffee shop writing this.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate: thank you all for your responses. \n\nI went to have lunch by myself to think things over and decided this is not the hill I want to die on. I compromised with my wife so I\u2019ll be making the turkeys as promised along with the pot roast. My wife and her mom will be going to Costco today to buy frozen side dishes and several of their tiramisus. Her parents are older and not very mobile so I cut them a lot of slack.\n\nTo answer some questions:\n\n1. We have a double full size oven and I\u2019ll be making the pot roast in the instant pot.\n2. We\u2019ll be paying for the additional items including the Costco things. Her parents are living on a strict budget and I\u2019m not super familiar with her siblings financials but I know we\u2019re better off. Thanksgiving is not the time I want to pick this fight.\n3. My stir fried green beans recipe is easy:\nA. Prep them then dry them\nB. Microwave them in an uncovered bowl for 1 min on high\nC. Heat up the pan on high heat and lightly oil it\nD. Prepare seasoning: salt, pepper, as much garlic as you like, soy sauce, and sesame oil\nE. Once the pan is hot, toss in the green beans to lightly sear it but not cook\nF. Add garlic, don\u2019t add too early or they\u2019ll burn\nG.

Very unreasonable to expect you to pick up everybody else's slack and/or poor planning. How many ovens do they think you have available anyhow?", "NTA.

Man that is fucking shameless. Like you said, I\u2019d go buy side dishes before I even dreamed of asking the person cooking the main course to do my sides as well.\n\nIt sounds like they didn\u2019t plan properly on their end, and just want to push off the responsibility on someone they assume will put up with it. Super inconsiderate of them. If you were doing like a side casserole and they asked you to do another side or 2, ok. But to ask the guy doing 2 whole ass turkeys to on short notice cater an entire 4 course meal with dessert for 30 people, the day before thanksgiving, man that pisses me off that they even have the audacity to ask. That is so fucking rude. \n \nI know it\u2019s probably not worth causing this much of a stir over but I\u2019d actually be tempted to tell them to find their own fucking turkey, and bail on them altogether \n\nTotally NTA, your family is inconsiderate as hell.", "NTA. If the other people are coming to a potluck without bringing any food, that's super AH behavior. It is very easy to pick something up if you cannot make it yourself. It is in no way your responsibility to take on their labor AND the cost of their food. Also, it seems the people NOT cooking the turkey are seriously underestimating the amount of work/time it takes to prepare them.", "NTA. It\u2019s rude AF to show up to a potluck empty handed. If people are too busy to cook, they can buy pre-made food and bring that. Expecting you to make all of those dishes at the last minute and in addition to the turkey is so inconsiderate!", "NTA. FWIW most pot luck Thanksgivings I know of/been invited to, the host handles the main (turkey/ham/whatever) and everyone else brings sides (homemade or store bought).

If they don't want to cook then buy something.", "NTA also they sound like the type of people who won't let you take your leftovers home with you. \n\nCan the wife maybe pick up a grocery store cake, make some mashed potatoes?", "Nta. And honestly they shouldn't of even asked you to cook the turkey", "NTA and I have *never* been to a potluck where there hasn\u2019t been enough food for everyone so I think you\u2019ll be just fine with whatever shows up. If there was someone who had their heart set on traditional (?) pot roast and cake thanksgiving dinner\u2026 I guess they can take it up with whoever bailed this year and sign up for the pot roast and cake duties next year.\n\nMy family almost always has a birthday land on thanksgiving and we still don\u2019t have cake\u2026 you get your candles shoved in a pumpkin pie and you make do!", "NTA.

But they have 0 respect for you and your time.", "NTA I don\u2019t care for turkey and I am more than happy to just eat sides. I always tell my family to not take the time to make me something special. If anyone insists on a different entree, they can make one themselves or buy something premade. Goes for sides too.

Of course she doesn\u2019t mind as she wouldn\u2019t have to lift a finger.", "INFO\n\nOk I\u2019m really interested in this on a more technical level. You\u2019re doing **two** turkeys. I assume you\u2019re paying for the birds?\n\nThey also want you to do a pot roast? Are you the one paying for the roast too?\n\nA potato dish? I presume instant mashed potatoes is not acceptable?\n\nFamous stir fried green beans sound yummy, would you share the recipe?\n\nCake takes a whole damn day by itself! I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t say you had to make the cake turkey shaped. If they want you to do a turkey shaped cake you should do it shaped like the country Turkey. \n\nIn most of America people do turkey in the oven. Pot roast has to be done in the oven. Mashed potatoes can be done on the stove but for good roasted potatoes you also need to use the oven. Stir fried green beans are on the stove. Cake uses the oven!\n\nSo **bare minimum** you would need four ovens. Five if you do roasted potatoes the turkeys and pot roast *have* to be cooked the day of thanksgiving. \n\n**How do they expect this to happen logistically?**", "NTA, however your wife is TA but not backing you and enforcing boundaries on her parents.\n\nYour in-laws are TA for allowing people to come to a potluck empty handed because \"life\" came up, and dumping everything on you. \n\nOptions: just do the turkeys and go with just them. Deal with the fallout.\nSkip this year. Cook for yourself and enjoy.\n\nI'd choose the second option. But petty revenge sounds good too!", "NTA at all! If your inlaws want all that, offer them the name of a good caterer,  and call it a day. The audacity of your wife and her parents to assume that you would be willing to put in that much work,  probably without your no-cooking ass wife, for them to take all the credit. Plus , who's supposed to pay for all that? The nerve!!", "Sounds like they tried to stick you with all the most expensive dishes too -- two turkeys, and now a pot roast?! As a vegetarian I don't have a clear idea of how much meat costs these days, but I'm pretty sure pot roasts are pricey? At least for a large crowd.\n    \nThey can easily pick up a store-made cake and a potato side if they are must haves. I'd stick with just the promised turkeys, or back out altogether if they keep pushing it.", " NTA but honestly I don\u2019t think you should go. They\u2019re taking advantage of you and it\u2019s ridiculous other people expect to go and not bring any food but you\u2019re expected to cook an entire freaking meal and bring it! no way!

You bend now, you are officially THEE cook for all holidays going forward.\n\nStay strong.", "NTA and they can easily buy a dish to bring if they do not want to cook.

If your wife thinks adding the extra dishes is no big deal then SHE can cook them.", "NTA. Look, I like taking chef duty because a) I know the food will be to my liking and b) I don't have to make small talk for as long or with as many people (am introverted and other people are generally exhausting). \n\nIn your shoes, I might be willing to do the green beans and/or potatoes, but only if the assigned person venmo'd me the $$ for ingredients.

At this point in time, I would make an alternative plan for thanksgiving and either drop the turkeys off at the ILs house, or, freeze them for future meals. Your wife is being a very bad partner.

Your wife and in-laws owe you apologies.", "> 10 minutes ago her parents called\n\n:does math:\n\nThey called you what, 26 hours before dinner is supposed to be served?  About four of which would have to be spent at grocery stores trying to find all that shit the day before T'giving?  NTA", "Fuck that. You\u2019re being asked to bring the main and a veggie and carb side plus dessert, and another pot roast? Hell tf no. I would tell her parents directly its too much and you aren\u2019t able to bring beyond what you promised. NTA", "NTA & she should being doing the extra cooking", "NTA.  This is very unreasonable of them to spring this on you at the last minute.  I don't get why the people who are coming but can't cook a dish can't purchase something themselves?  Sounds to me that you and your wife are being played here.\n\nIt was nice of you to agree to cook extra but I'd be on the lookout for this to happen again next year.", "NTA 10000%\nYour parents in law are hosting - if somebody can't bring a dish, it's the responsibility of the host to make sure there's enough food", "NTA\u2026but I have some simple ideas.  Whoever was supposed to bring the cake, they can buy a store bought one.  Whoever was supposed to bring the mashed potatoes, again, all they have to do is buy store bought ones, put them in a serving dish and microwave.  Presto! Done.  The roast.  Whoever was to bring a roast, all they need to do is buy the roast, a packet of ranch dressing, a packet of brown gravy mix and one stick of butter.  Stick in a crockpot in the am and you they will have one of the best yummy roasts ever!  There is no reason the people that were supposed to bring these things cannot do the simple things above.  They just don\u2019t want to and they don\u2019t want to spend the extra money either.  The roast alone.   You are now expected to not only cook these items but pay for them too?   And if your wife balks at you not cooking those things, the above are simple things that anyone can do.  She can do them.", "I would tell her i'm still down to make the 2 turkeys I promised, but golly don'tcha know something else came up and I can't make all the extra stuff. And when they ask what it is, say you don't really know, but it's important.", "NTA. you are so kind to come to a good compromise. Also Your stir fry green bean recipe is similar to my air fry green bean recipe. Instead of cooking them in a pan on high heat, i toss them in oil or spray them, air fry until they are blistery, then toss them in with some gently saut\u00e9ed garlic and soy sauce. I\u2019m gonna add sesame oil next time!", "Are you kidding me? Why didn't I ever think to microwave the beans first! Would cut down on the skillet time!", "We\u2019ve been known to do a turkey and a ham because not everyone likes turkey and one turkey wasn\u2019t going to be enough anyway.", "Not everyone likes turkey.", "Which likely already cost 50-100 dollars depending if they bought it fresh or frozen and size.", "My family's rule is always the host doesn't have to cook. The host provides the venue and has to clean up after everyone leaves, so the host provides a side of a dessert but doesn't cook. \n\nImo that's fair.", "Hint: she did not.\n\nInstead she took her family side.", "She can go buy a cake", "Oh, they know. That's why they're asking OP to do it.", "Stir fried green beans sounds like Sayur Buncis. An Indonesian/Dutch colonial style dish.", "Now that I have a turkey air fryer, the turkey is the easiest thing to do. A little butter and herb mix under the skin, salt and pepper into the cavity, olive oil spray on skin and walls of air fryer, put turkey into basket into air fryer connected to propane tank outside. Hook up blue tooth thermometer and walk away. Come out to get it when it reaches correct temp. Done.\nAgree that taking on anything else is nonsense. If your wife tells you she already agreed, tell her SHE can cook it, you are not!", "This. What is wrong with the wife?", "Plus you can get the ham basically ready to eat from Honeymade.", "Yeah, sure, not everyone likes turkey, but\u2026it\u2019s Thanksgiving.  Unless someone legitimately cannot eat it due to dietary restrictions (and I can\u2019t think of a restriction that covers turkey but not pot roast), I think it\u2019s on them to just fill up on sides and grab something else for themselves before/after if that\u2019s not enough.  Especially if the people doing the cooking don\u2019t have the time, budget, or oven space to cook a whole other entree.", "Ha! My mom does a turkey and a ham because everyone loves her turkey and her ham.\n\nAnd that one year she didnt make the ham was highly confusing.\n\nLike, no one complained and no one was exactly disappointed. But you could see brains short circuit as people noticed the missing ham.", "We always did our turkeys on the barbecue. That freed up the oven for sides and reduced the mess in the oven from spilled basting juices.", "That's fair when the guests bring the food.  In this case, the guests are coming but not bringing the food.  It shouldn't be on OP to work harder because they couldn't plan properly.  Not a good comparison.", "Truthfully, it's completely unclear as it's written. Technically the \"she\" refers to wife's mom, bc that's the most recent female referent; but from the rest of the paragraph it would appear it means wife. V confusing tbf.", "Oh, interesting. I looked that up, sounds delicious and I\u2019ll have to make it sometime. Thanks.", "Not unless you order it way in advance and I know people who preordered and paid, had record of their receipt of the order and were told they were out of luck because they ran out.", "But if it\u2019s cook a second bird from scratch or warm up a ham while the bird is resting\u2026 the ham is easier, usually cheaper, makes more guests happy, and adds variety to the leftovers.", "That\u2019s what I thought. The day before thanksgiving is waaaaay to late to tell someone they have to bring another entree, never mind sides and a dessert. \n\nI\u2019m bringing potatoes and apple crisp. I bought the duck fat for the potatoes last week (and I had to go to three grocery stores to find it). The spices over the weekend. The potatoes and apples last night. \n\nApparently OP\u2019s family is too shitty to plan ahead.", "I mean, it\u2019s a moot point, since OP didn\u2019t offer to cook ham, pot roast, or anything *but* turkey.", "Plus I think you have to order the ham in advance. I\u2019ve never actually been in charge of the ham but I don\u2019t think you can just waltz into Honeymade on Thanksgiving morning and demand a ham without ordering in advance.", "No, but I was responding to your implication that turkey was the only acceptable meat on thanksgiving, not OP\u2019s declining to prepare 4 more dishes.", "lol you sure can\u2019t. At the one near my place, the local police always hang out the day before Thanksgiving to make sure no one gets out of hand, plus they get easy money by writing tickets for people not paying attention to the giant line of cars down the road and bumping into them \ud83d\ude02", "All I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s particularly ludicrous to expect him to make an entirely *optional* big, time-intensive dish on top of what he\u2019s already doing.", "At least two time intensive dishes. \n\nCakes take all day. I don\u2019t care who you are."]}
