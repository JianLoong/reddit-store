In that time I have been mostly working in an online job due to various health issues. I had a transplant some time ago, I have fibromyalgia, and a few other issues. \nRecently, I lost my health insurance and I started looking for new work. It was just too expensive for private healthcare and the meds to just stay where I was. Recently, I was offered a job pending a physical and a TB test. I filled out all my forms, got my physical, and am waiting for the results of my TB test (which will be read tomorrow). \nI didn\u2019t want to tell a lot of people about the offer. I know the job can take the offer off the table if they think my physical is too many issues. I told three people total - my husband, my mom, and my best friend. \nMy mom quickly told a bunch of people. I asked her to stop and explained that I want to wait until they accept my physical to announce anything. My husband told me today that he told his parents in a call without me. I told him, calmly, that it bothered me. That I was waiting to tell people because of the physical issue and that when/if it went well I wanted to tell people. He apologized and we moved on. \n\nFast forward to tonight. He holds an online game that I play in. I bowed out tonight because I have just been stressed about everything, which he said was fine. When game was over he came down and told me that he told our friends about the job offer. I was livid. I asked why he did that. He said he didn\u2019t think it was a big deal and just told them we were waiting for everything to come through. \nThis is where I may be the AH. I yelled. I actively yelled. I reminded him that I told him earlier that I didn\u2019t want anyone to know until it was absolutely final. That I was concerned about my physical. And that I just wanted to wait. I asked him why he would do this. He just apologized, but I didn\u2019t want to hear it at that point. I asked him to just leave me alone the rest of the night. \nAITA?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t clarify. I actively told all three that I wanted to wait until I had the physical results to tell everyone that the job was 100% secure. As of now I have received an offer - which I accepted - but the physical hasn\u2019t been accepted.

You told him not to tell people, he did, you again told him not to and he did it again.\n\nIf he routinely ignores your wishes and does things you\u2019ve asked him not to do (assuming your request is reasonable) then you should be very concerned.  If this isn\u2019t typical behavior on his part, then maybe tell him that this made you not trust him and that in the future you may withhold info from him that he needs to know, because he can\u2019t seem to keep his mouth shut.", "Nta- it was a simple request- do not spread my job situation.  He violated it.   Acknowledged YOUR LEGITIMATE REQUEST, said sorry; TURN AROUND AND DID IT AGAIN!!!! Like wtf?!?!?  This was make me angry for several reasons- he obviously lied when apologizing.  \nHe didn't respect you enough to think YOU SPECIFICALLY SAYING DO NOT do this was \"a big deal\"\nBig hugs\nSending you blessings", "NTA. You told him don\u2019t tell anyone, he told his parents anyways. You talked about it, he apologized. How could he possibly think it was ok to tell his friends?", "NTA\n\nYou were so, so clear - and yet he told his friends. Sometimes people need a virtual slap in the face. Yelling isn't OK, and I'd probably feel differently if the genders were reversed.\n\nBut his actions were complete bullshit and disrespectful.", "NTA, but, and I don't mean to be disrespectful here, I genuinely don't see how it's such a big deal whether or not people know that you may have a job sometime in the near future, pending a clear physical exam. Even if you don't get the job, that doesn't reflect negatively on you, it just means you're one of several million qualified people on this planet who didn't get a job because of a bullshit reason. \n\nLike I said, you're NTA because, though I don't understand your reasoning, the fact of the matter is that it _was_ important to _you_ and your husband neglected to understand and respect that. I _do_ think, though, that if you're in a similar position in the future and it doesn't seem like he's understanding how much whatever it is means to you, then please just sit down and explain it to him. Speaking from experience, men can be _dense_ and won't always be able to pick up on how you're feeling unless you tell them.", "NTA - It was fine for him to tell his parents, but after when you made it clear to your husband that you didn't want him to go around spreading the news... he did it again anyway. Even if he's excited for you, that's no excuse to do the thing you told him already not to do. That's disrespectful. \n\nThat said, he did apologize. Don't hold a big grudge unless he does it a 3rd time.", "Asking someone to keep a secret and them continually, repeatedly, ignoring it and then acting like it\u2019s not a big deal is messed up. This happens to me with my family all the time- and now I have to edit everything I tell them, and consider it it\u2019s worth it in every conversations. Ask him if he wants that to be how your communication is in the future- that you have to worry about discussing stressful things with him because he can\u2019t be trusted to respect your privacy? NAH do not listen to these people- maybe yelling was harsh but when your life parter repeatedly ignores your specific requests repeatedly what else are you supposed to do?", "NTA. People disrespecting boundaries in general is straight up disrespect. Your mother has no excuse, and your husband still shouldn\u2019t have said it, ADHD aside, and then further try to sneak out if it by trying to justify it. \n\nIt\u2019s medical news, it\u2019s your news alone and even telling tonnes of people about job offers in specific cases can cause some companies to contemplate how well you could keep private information secure. It\u2019s not your fault directly but it could impact you if it they ran a background check.", "ESH: Him for doing something you specifically asked him not to. And you for yelling at him.\n\nDoubt you never did anything he didn't like, would you be ok if after doong something wrong he yelled at you?", "NTA- you told all 3 people originally not to spread this information. Your mother told people, you told her a second time to knock it off. She did.\n\nYour husband told people. You told him a second time to knock it off, he didn't. You even told him a third time when you yelled and all he could do was apologize even though you gave valid justification as to why you waited. And he didn't even tell them it was an offer, he made it seem, from what you wrote, that you got the offer and are just waiting on paperwork. When in reality, that's not the case, and if it doesn't go through you have a shitton of people asking questions that was none of their business to begin with.", "INFO: Did your mother tell more people than your husband? It seems frivolous, but you are somewhat drawing lines here, so I wanted to know if it was the time, people, quantity, or combination that made your husband the AH but not your mother.\n\nI can see that the husband told 2 people, his parents, and your close friends after you spoke with him. Fair. But if your mom blasted it to 100 people, but just once would that be more ok?

That is if husband was there to see the effects of that on you.", "So did you get the job sorry too soon?", "YTA. Your husband has been spending his life with someone who is chronically ill.
