Your brother and your mom both are, though. Your brother for acting like he\u2019s entitled to be racist AF and not be called out, and your mom for freaking defending it and defending him trying to indoctrinate his kids with that kind of hate.

I think it's very plainly obvious why your brother/aunt/mom are TA here, but I don't think you're TA for blowing up in front of your nieces because it shows them how very not-okay their father's behavior is. Racism isn't the same as a character flaw like being selfish or having a bad temper, and really should never ever be allowed to pass the way your family have been excusing your brother's. I feel terrible for your poor husband, and I hope the two of you can be a good influence on your nieces in the future.", "NTA. Good for you for standing up to racism.

Bro should know better ESPECIALLY to speak to kids about it or around them in such a manner. Bonus loser points for doing it to his own bro in law. You are so NTA for losing ur shit. I would have blown a gasket myself personally. I married in (and out) of a marriage with an indigenous man and we have 2 girls.

Here\u2019s the deal no culture, language or skin color is superior in any way.

I wish I was more eloquent with my argument instead of screaming at him but siblings really know how to get you upset.", "Thanks for sharing your opinion. I\u2019ll try and learn from him to be calmer in future. You guys sadly have experience dealing with racism in your everyday lives and i\u2019m still learning how to react like an adult. I think you are 100% right, distance is needed and a ban on all hate speech at family events.", "Mate, thank you. This is what I needed to read. They will hopefully form their own opinions and all we can do is make sure we are here setting a good example. I\u2019ll try and react with a more educated response in future to set a better example.

Its hard to judge if you were overreacting or not.", "Oops sorry got carried away lol\u2026laws protecting freedom of speech but NOT hate speech. That is not a right it\u2019s a crime.

I shut that shit down, hard.", "It's because they are also racist. It's easier to tell you that you're overreacting than to confront their own bigotry. I would go no contact with all of them.", "Bro\u2019s outburst could be a blessing in a very good disguise. The only thing worse than blatant racism is covert racism.

Hopefully what they learn from him and get to experience with him will far outweigh the racism of your brother.", "Your brother admits he\u2019s racist, so you calling him racist is just stating a fact.

Mum definitely isnt a racist in her everyday life. Her family migrated to Aus and she suffered racism herself. She just wants us all to \u2018get along\u2019 and likes to try and smooth things over which is so frustrating.

If I heard a close family member coming out with any of that sort of shit, I'd go ballistic. You definitely didn't over react, in my view, but you're right that educating (or attempting to educate) your racist brother when he says stuff like this is a better way forward. He probably won't listen, but your nieces sure as hell will.", "Thanks for the experience and advice! Yeah, I absolutely took it as a personal attack. There was only one poc in the convo so of course we assume it was directed at him. I\u2019ll try not to engage in front of the kids in future and take a step back from my relationship with my bro. Its imperative the kids dont loose contact with us though, theyre so important. Its a learning experience.", "Holy shit i\u2019m so sorry that you had to deal with that.

If theres ever another situation, i\u2019ll try to be a bit more adult about my reaction. I felt stupid getting so upset as a grown woman but its the shock and embarrassment of realising that your family is racist.", "Yeah, i\u2019ll have to tread carefully though. Its not my intention to turn the kids away from their dad or form bad opinions of him. But so, so important for them to hear the opposing argument. Thanks for the suggestion, I might ask sil if we can chat to them.", "Smoothing things over no matter what only works until it becomes a hostile act to you & your family, even if only passively.\n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this on top of her favoritism.", "Good plan. Don\u2019t get me wrong I would have ripped lips and probably swore a blue streak 3 inches from my own brothers face in front of granny, kids, cats & dogs. It might have been over the top but they need to see that happen too when it comes to racism. It\u2019s just unacceptable and so minimizing the conflict is always good but I get in the heat of the moment shit happens. Good on you both for remaining focused on the girls. They have a right to all of you in their lives and are definitely showing interest and engaging wholeheartedly with their uncle. It\u2019s sweet and wonderful and I\u2019m sure it will sort itself out and those girls will come out ahead of their dad and maybe even school him someday \ud83d\udc9c", "Folks need to watch out for internet content that can radicalize, it's not as slow as one might think, a few short buzzwords and one well spoken expert can make even the most disgusting of ideals sound appealing, in nearly no time at all.", "I don't think you were stupid for being upset about discovering your brother and mother are racists. All I can think is you may feel betrayed by some of the people you are supposed to feel the most secure with, but the reality just hits you very hard.", "I was wondering about this. His opinions have escalated recently. Australia is having a referendum re: having an Indigenous voice to parliament in our constitution. It has sparked some pretty racist debate between households and in the media. I\u2019m not sure how to address the radicalisation issue with family though.", "Facts won't always work since someone who is radicalized is probably going to lean on fallacies as a comeback instead of having honest dialogue.  \n\n\n\"well what about x?\" 'it's reverse racism.\"  \n\n\nthings like that \\^ obviously ignore things like 350+ years of slavery.  \n\n\n since it's the 'future' now and racism is 'gone' therefore these people I'm being racist towards are just looking for a handout and my new shitty comments are justified.  \n\n\nis it a strawman? maybe, have I had people I know say things just like the stuff above? yes, and they honestly believe racism was all fixed with civil rights in the 60's. One of my least favorite phrases has now become \"Is it wrong to notice patterns?\" in reference to things like statistics in crime/poverty related to POC."]}
