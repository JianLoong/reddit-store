Your brother and your mom both are, though. Your brother for acting like he\u2019s entitled to be racist AF and not be called out, and your mom for freaking defending it and defending him trying to indoctrinate his kids with that kind of hate.

I think it's very plainly obvious why your brother/aunt/mom are TA here, but I don't think you're TA for blowing up in front of your nieces because it shows them how very not-okay their father's behavior is.

I\u2019ll try and learn from him to be calmer in future. You guys sadly have experience dealing with racism in your everyday lives and i\u2019m still learning how to react like an adult.

I would go no contact with all of them.", "Bro\u2019s outburst could be a blessing in a very good disguise. The only thing worse than blatant racism is covert racism.

Hopefully what they learn from him and get to experience with him will far outweigh the racism of your brother.", "Your brother admits he\u2019s racist, so you calling him racist is just stating a fact.

He probably won't listen, but your nieces sure as hell will.", "Thanks for the experience and advice! Yeah, I absolutely took it as a personal attack. There was only one poc in the convo so of course we assume it was directed at him. I\u2019ll try not to engage in front of the kids in future and take a step back from my relationship with my bro.

Don\u2019t get me wrong I would have ripped lips and probably swore a blue streak 3 inches from my own brothers face in front of granny, kids, cats & dogs. It might have been over the top but they need to see that happen too when it comes to racism. It\u2019s just unacceptable and so minimizing the conflict is always good but I get in the heat of the moment shit happens. Good on you both for remaining focused on the girls.
