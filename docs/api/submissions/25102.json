I think it's very plainly obvious why your brother/aunt/mom are TA here, but I don't think you're TA for blowing up in front of your nieces because it shows them how very not-okay their father's behavior is.

Hopefully what they learn from him and get to experience with him will far outweigh the racism of your brother.", "Your brother admits he\u2019s racist, so you calling him racist is just stating a fact.

He probably won't listen, but your nieces sure as hell will.", "Thanks for the experience and advice! Yeah, I absolutely took it as a personal attack. There was only one poc in the convo so of course we assume it was directed at him. I\u2019ll try not to engage in front of the kids in future and take a step back from my relationship with my bro.

Don\u2019t get me wrong I would have ripped lips and probably swore a blue streak 3 inches from my own brothers face in front of granny, kids, cats & dogs. It might have been over the top but they need to see that happen too when it comes to racism.

She is not a racist. However, she is not an assertive person and likes to \u2018keep the peace\u2019 between family members by smoothing things over. I\u2019m upset that she took my brothers side again and enabled him. I quite often am dismissed as being \u2018loud mouthed\u2019 or too opinionated.

Your brother mostly but you say at the very top of your post that your family have \u201caccepted him wholeheartedly\u201d yet continue to make racist comments to him/about him.\n\nSo they haven\u2019t accepted him.\n\nYou may call them out but you are still seemingly continuing to expose him to your racist AF family and that makes you an asshole too.", "Right or wrong he is still allowed his opinion. Just because he doesn't think like you doesn't make him an asshole. Not everyone thinks about race the same.", "NTA\n\nHe should keep his toxic opinions in his head rather than letting them spew out of his mouth.   Bigotry isn't \"an opinion\", its bigotry.   I'm really sorry that you and your husband had to hear that from a family member.    And that you were supposed to let it go as he is entitled to say it - no,  no he really isn't.", "NTA at all!!!!!!!", "Good on your husband for keeping his cool and not giving your brother a fucking wack. Seems like your brother has never been checked on his shit by someone outside the family OR he doesn\u2019t speak like that outside of family BECAUSE he\u2019s been smacked for it. NTA you did good stepping up and protecting your husband. Feel proud of your opinion and choices.", "You did nothing wrong in the slightest. You are not now and never will be the AH in that situation. Your brother's racism is a conscious decision on his part, as is your mother's tacit support in saying it's his right to be racist. What he said was disrespectful to your husband, but by extension was also disrespectful to you since you chose to marry him. He is showing no respect to you or your relationship with him by showing no respect to him and his culture. Your brother is the AH and, if he keeps this up, I wouldn't be surprised if his children lost contact with their aunt as part of the bargain. You are unquestionably NTA.", "I grew up in a racist family. My mother is of Arabic descent. I was racially abused by relatives of my step father and he NEVER said anything.\nYou did NOTHING wrong.

Keep your kids away from them.", "NTA at all. I'm a British Jew of eastern European origin... racism in mainland Europe is why my great grandparents fled to London and why I'm alive. I've also been subjected to antisemitism by people I thought I could trust (including my ex best friend who I had to involve the police with). Nobody has ever defended me where antisemitism is involved.\n\nYou have done the absolute right thing and it takes a lot of courage to stand up against people you love who are doing the wrong and racist thing. Your husband is lucky to have you. Your niece is definitely not learning racism from her father and is lucky to have you and your husband there to keep her open-minded. I love how she wants to learn, and your husband engages positively with her.\n\nThank you for doing the right thing, and I'm so sorry your family are bigoted. Keep on doing the right thing, for the next generation in your family.", "NTA your brother may be an adult but that doesn't excuse racist behavior and in no way should the family be on with him using those slurs. It's disgusting.", "NTA tolerating the intolerant is not tolerance.", "NTA", "NTA. That wasn\u2019t an opinion that was hate speech and that\u2019s not covered by free speech legislation . You were wonderful !  You are worth ten of any member of your family", "NTA and you should be proud for standing up against your brother and standing up against racism. Now your family allowing the racism from your brother and saying he has a right to be racist is not right. By condoning it, they\u2019re racist too. They need to realize that. I would think about how you want to interact with your family going forward.", "Your brother is a *word that would get me banned* and your mother is an apologist \n\nNTA \n\nIf your brother is allowed by his mother to be racist then you are allowed to give him hell for it.", "NTA and you did not react badly. Your reaction was justified completely. I'd feel concerned letting my children around people like your brother and you did the right thing by leaving. Imo, it's completely justified permanently cutting family members off for things like this.", "NTA. I want to note one thing that I didn't see when I scanned the comments so far and that is the \"shoving it in our faces\" comment. Think about what that would mean rationally. What would it mean if someone shoved their culture in your face (to essentially forcefully coerce attention and do so to a sensitive part of us)? I'm not sure what that would look like, but it's not teaching some words and music at school, where the purpose is to learn things like language and hopefully music. \n\nSo there's no literal face shoving, but something has convinced Little Mr Racist that is effectively the case. Why? How would this be avoided? Might be worth asking him, see if he's honest. \n\nA *lot* of racism is hid behind people supposedly knowing their (lesser) place and acknowledging the majority's supposedly rightful superior place. Saying blacks are fine as long as they stay on their side of town or know their place is not the same as burning crosses and lynching, but none of that happens without people like your Little Mr Racist implicitly supporting them. He shouldn't be directly responsible for things like that, but because things like that have happened that means you cannot dismiss such comments. For me, that's the comment that tells me how he really sees the world and your family. \n\nI'd be clear with him that you'll take him back if he owns and actually understands but zero tolerance until then.", "NTA. I'd disown/leave my family if they did shit like that, tbh.", "NTA. You stuck up for your husband who at that moment couldn\u2019t speak for himself.

He can do or say whatever the hell he wants. What he *can't* do is be exempt from consequences. The consequence of behaving like a hateful bigot is that people will think that he's a hateful bigot; the consequence of harassing and insulting your husband is that it's going to have a negative impact on his relationship with you and your husband. Your response was appropriate.\n\nNTA.", "\u2649\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udda4\n\nEdit: Kid was playing with the phone\u2026\nBut NTA of course!", "You need to stop being around your brother and anyone who is racist in your family. that\u2019s horrible and completely unfair to your husband.

Its a bit of a shock. Makes you feel pretty sad.", "Wow, really? I\u2019m so sorry. And i\u2019m even more sorry you havent heard from them since. Thats despicable behaviour. Sometimes I do wonder if he would even notice if I stopped contacting him.", "Duuuuuuuude, youre onto something there. I have let so much slide in the past because i want to keep seeing his kids. Maybe mums in the same boat. But surely the line has been crossed now?!", "Totally. I reacted emotionally 3 times in a row. And couldn\u2019t control the tears. I think this is why i\u2019m second guessing myself if I was the ah. I felt like a child. My family have a way of making anyone who agitates things feel ostracised. I guess it was just that weight of realisation that your sibling is a genuine, 100% racist and no matter what, Mum will always have his back. I need to learn to be less reactive in future so that I can educate.", "Thanks for sharing your experience and making me see things from his perspective. He shouldn\u2019t be subject to these idiots. I personally wont go nc purely for the kids but will absolutely have the convo with hubby that he can go nc.", "My bro is the eldest & the favourite by far. He shares the same traditional values as my parents. My sister and I tend to be seen as \u2018agitators\u2019 for our progressive views. Or just the fact that we are women and are opinionated. I think I reacted very badly by yelling at my bro in front of his kids. I wish I didn\u2019t get emotional and could\u2019ve educated him and won the argument with calm, concise facts. I just keep replaying the convo from the kids perspective, seeing their dad and aunty dight like that must\u2019ve been confusing.", "He is the man.", "Absolutely, its pretty fucked actually. I\u2019d dismissed a lot of it as \u2018pub talk\u2019 in the past or that Aussie larrikin style of trying to get a rise out of people.

He surprises me every day.", "If she enables him, she is as bad.", "Yep i totally get your opinion and see your point. Absolutely something to think about and discuss with hubby. Thanks for the opposing view.", "Yeah so this was his argument. Would you mind elaborating so I can understand him a bit better? Why would someone think it would be appropriate to have a conversation about my husbands race in front of his face and then use racial slurs in front of kids. Having an opinion would be okay if it was educated and he had reasoning behind it. Just hating my husbands race for no reason is not something I could ever understand. How would you suggest I shouldve engaged with him?", "Being racist is being an ass", "Great point. In Aus we are holding a referendum in late 2023 for an amendment to the constitution to allow an advisory body as an indigenous voice to Govt. Were calling it \u2018The Voice\u2019 referendum and its raised some very heated debates in households and all over the media. In my household, we are very excited about this change and cant wait to vote yes. In my brothers household, he will be voting no. This conversation is necessary but divisive. I think maybe he is \u2018sick of hearing about it\u2019 and \u2018sick of hearing about aboriginals\u2019 because its in the media at the moment and he\u2019s feeling excluded by his views. Then his daughter goes to school and learns indigenous history which is different to the colonisation history that we were taught at school.

Sadly, by accepting your brother you family are acting equally racist. Wonder if they've considered that. So sorry you and your hubby had to put up with that. So glad your neices seem engaged and interested.", "To paraphrase a German saying about nazis: If there ten people dining together and they tolerate one racist among them, it\u2019s a table of 10 racists.", "You aren't overly sensitive. That is what shitty people say to other people to keep them from calling out their bad behavior.", "They are wrong.", "Rights are guaranteed by the government. Families can enforce whatever behavioral standard they like.

It'd be counter productive long term.\n\nMalevolent racism- racism for racism sake- absolutely does.\n\nIgnorant racism can be combated through aggressive social education campaigns and through individuals (regardless of race) helping educate others. Basically take what conservatives are using to radicalized young people and use it to deradicalize.\n\nMalevolent racism doesn't have a fix- because those people are wired wrong and need to be treated like rabid dogs.", "I think part of why you feel bad is because social conditioning tells people to \u201clet things go\u201d for the sake of something else. \n\nSomewhere inside you know family gatherings cannot go on as usual and it\u2019s you that has to decide how to proceed.\n\nYou also just might not feel comfortable reacting the way you did because it\u2019s not your usual zone.", "Do NOT apologize. Apologies would make it seem to the kids like he did something right and you were wrong. You shouldn't apologize ever for taking a racist to the verbal cleaners.", "If my brother made racist remarks about my hubby, I would cut him out of my life. Your husband is your 1st priority. You were not out of line yelling. Never apologize for calling out your racist brother - and - I\u2019m sorry- your racist mother. I know you love your nieces, but you need to protect your husband.

Awfull people like that do not deserve anything but silence.", "It\u2019s so hard to soak up the racism and respond rationally. 33 years and I\u2019m still working on it.

Thanks for being an ally.", "Yeah, but that\u2019s kind of naive. Why would a racist be interested in listening to your \u201ccalm, concise facts\u201d?  Your brother doesn\u2019t care and it\u2019s highly unlikely he ever will.\n\nAnd it\u2019s entirely reasonable to become emotional when someone is being vicious. Why is your brother allowed to be irrational, but you\u2019re not allowed to feel emotions?\n\nThis is not an argument you can \u201dwin.\u201d This is a boundary you have to set.

She suffered and yet she is apologising for him and standing up for his right to be racist.", "Fuck. Nah I haven\u2019t heard that one before. Thats hitting hard.", "I can agree with that.", "Totally. They are so smart, kind & curious and I cant believe we are still having conversations like this in 2023. We can try our best so that the next gen can do better.", "Yeah, this is 100% it. Hit the nail on the head.

Really didn't want to make you feel worse but honestly, calling out racism is never an overreaction.", "The poster above is 100% right. I strongly believe that your entire family is racist or at least holds some of the same racist views as your brother (your niece may still have a chance). The fact they all knew your brother was racist and his comments didn\u2019t come as a shock? The fact the only one they\u2019re mad at is you? The fact that they\u2019re fine with your husband being on the receiving end of hearing that crap? Sounds like a pack of racists on the loose. \n\nFrankly, the comments that you described at the beginning of your post are all appallingly racist, as well. Your husband has probably been biting his tongue about it but I think it\u2019s time for you to take a hard look at your family and decide whose feelings matter more: his or theirs, and go no/low contact accordingly.", "If you don't you'll have lost them to racism too.", "The true disruption is him, but you get blamed  because the only way things continue as they were is if you eat the shit sandwich.\n\nIt\u2019s a painful situation. Standing up for what\u2019s good and right should feel way better than it does.\n\nIt\u2019s always good to apologize to kids if you acted in a way that you were uncomfortable with them hearing or seeing. Like apologize for yelling or cursing but definitely not for the reason.", "Fingers crossed they will learn to do the schooling! I\u2019d love to see it! \ud83d\udcaa", "I think there are subjects where we need to demonstrate that reasonable disagreement is possible and there are subjects were absolute disgust is the only healthy response. Children should not be taught that racism is subject to debate. It\u2019s not a subject where two people can \u201drationally disagree.\u201d It\u2019s disgusting and the only healthy response is disgust.\n\nTo put it another way, your husband should not need to debate his worth as a human being. His wife is not obligated to debate his worth as a human being. Anyone who thinks that his worth is subject to debate should not be around him.\n\nI know this is easier said than done with family. You might get some success by giving your brother the chance to behave himself but leaving if and when he fails. So, show up to events where he is, but, if he starts sounding off, leave. This approach also applies when your parents start trotting out their soft racism.", "Nah don\u2019t apologise. Its food for thought.", "Youre probably right that the majority do hold some racist views or they would be as upset as me, not defending his behaviour. \n\nMy niece is a kind, curious, smart, funny 8 year old who is now having her first exposure to conversations about race. She has wonderful influences around her other than my bro, including an amazing mum. I feel like I let her down by getting upset and in a screaming match instead of just shutting that shit down. But my hubby deserves better respect from my family. Its a hard one hey.", "Thanks for that, yeah actually I would feel better if I had a convo with the kids and apologise for the language and raising my voice. Its not the way I would want then to behave of they came across a bigot or a bully. \n\nI guess i have to decide if i let this situation cool down or if i use this opportunity to set ground rules going forward.", "You are 100% right. Thanks for putting this into perspective. Racism isnt a debate. Its bigotry. I wish I could go back in time and use your words instead of getting so upset. \n\nI am so ashamed and embarrassed that my hubby was put through that. His feelings are dismissed by my family because they say he doesn\u2019t look full aboriginal so he\u2019s not \u2018allowed\u2019 to take offence. Its fucked up. Outrage and PC culture is strongly criticised. \n\nThanks for the suggestion moving forward. I\u2019m not going to see him individually for a while as a sibling, only at family events. I will absolutely take your suggestion to calmly comment and leave as soon as any hate speech is mentioned. Even under the guise of jokes."]}
