This is a question about this specific AITA situation. \n\nEdit - There are hundreds of different Aboriginal groups across Australia and they have different customs and practices regarding their cultural instruments.

I am white and its not my place to comment. Please drop it. \n\nHubby (17 yrs together) is Aboriginal. My family has accepted him wholeheartedly in every other way except they make remarks about his Aboriginality because he looks \u2018too white\u2019, is \u2018not a real Aboriginal\u2019 or is \u2018one of the good ones\u2019.

She asked if they could jam on an upcoming camping trip.\n\nDuring the trip, hubby was repairing nieces didge. My family were discussing how cool it is that they teach local language & culture at school now. Bro then ranted about how the school can teach his daughter that shit but when she gets home he tells her its all crap. That we speak English. That hes sick of having culture shoved in his face. He uses the bad racial slurs, including the N word. The kids were in earshot. Hubby was next to me. Before anyone else had the chance to react, I blew up. It escalated so quickly in the way that siblings can. I was embarrassed about my family. My aunty joined in the conversation and it felt like she was taking my bros side. I tried to get him to empathise by sharing how hubbys family were directly affected by stolen generation. Bro continued the racial slurs & said that he is entitled to his opinion. I was crying & screaming at him that he was a fucking racist. He admitted that he was & that it was his \u2018right\u2019. \n\nHubby & I stormed off & he said he was upset. I apologised. He apologised for not sticking up for me in the heat of the moment but it was a heated family fight. Its my responsibility to address as its my family. He said he was proud & i\u2019d done nothing wrong but had reacted too emotionally. I agreed.\n\nI cooled down and returned to address my bro but mum intercepted me & asked if I was ok. She wasnt there for the argument. I said I wasnt ok & was still crying. She said she knows bro is racist but hes an adult and can say whatever he likes to his own family. I snapped back \u2018so its okay for him to call people (insert racial slur) in front of hubby and his kids?\u2019 Mum said \u2018well yes if he wants to.\u2019 I snapped & stormed off.\n\nMy Aunty apologised to me & hubby & we resolved the issue.

I think it's very plainly obvious why your brother/aunt/mom are TA here, but I don't think you're TA for blowing up in front of your nieces because it shows them how very not-okay their father's behavior is.

There was only one poc in the convo so of course we assume it was directed at him. I\u2019ll try not to engage in front of the kids in future and take a step back from my relationship with my bro.

Would your mom be equally okay with if you in front your niece laughed about what a miserable pathetic man your brother is? If you belittled him and said that even though his low intelligence, statistically, due to his racist beliefs, he\u2019s an okay person but you lk wish people like him weren\u2019t allowed to breed offspring in 20 years time. I have a feeling then your mom would back down a bit on that \u201ceveryone should say anything they want in a family\u201d.

It reminds me of what my ex from South Africa told me, that a lot of parents seemed to wanting to be open to a more mixed society, but when kids where being taught Xhosa (a language in South Africa primarily spoken by black people), a  lot of \u201ctolerant\u201d parents became very outraged why their kids were learning this. I hope maybe you get to talk to your niece more about this, I hope your husband\u2019s kindness alone will be enough to sway your niece to compassion and interest in learning about the culture more than her dad\u2019s abhorrent and vile world view.

We moved to a remote area early in our relationship and I was also fucking sickened at the sentiments towards Aboriginal Communities. The change is coming, but its slow. We are holding a referendum in later this year to vote if there should be an amendment to the constitution to include an Aboriginal & TSI advisory body. This has brought the race debate to every household and workplace. The media is inciting hate. First nations people are copping the heat at the moment. It sucks.

Our history curriculum has been rewritten as the way my generation (31f btw) was taught was written in a way that celebrated what the settlers did and left out the r*pe, theft, destruction and oppression that came with them. The new curriculum is more true to events and has broken down so many barriers with older generations hearing it from their older teens and realising there is so much they didn\u2019t know.
