Since I am really busy, whenever I have free time I take advantage of it, I like being alone while relaxing so I silence my phone a lot because I need a peace of mind sometimes. \n\nNow this week, my sister messaged me asking if I could watch my niece and nephews today and I as respectfully as I could, explained I wasn\u2019t able to because I wanted to rest from having to work all last week and a lot this week too. She took it to heart I guess and called me saying I don\u2019t care about them anymore but I love them a lot and I told her I\u2019d be happy to watch them this weekend just not today. She didn\u2019t say anything afterwards and I thought it was over.\n\nNow earlier today, I heard a knock at my door while I was just watching TV and I look through my peephole and see my sister and all her kids together waiting. I was a bit pissed so I didn\u2019t answer the door and I went upstairs and just started getting ready to take a shower, I heard the knocking a couple more times before I went into the shower and had her call my phone a few times but I just silenced my phone and went in.\n\nAfter I had finished showering, I came downstairs and looked through the peephole, and I don\u2019t even see my sister anymore, I just see her kids waiting on the steps of my porch, sitting. I as quick as I could let them all in pissed. I told them to go to the kitchen and told them I would get them something to eat, I call my sister and I see she has me blocked. I call CPS and tell them everything, and they notify my sister that they have her kids, she parks behind my driveway and walks up, and gets questioned, and gives me a glare. \n\nSoon she called my mom and told her everything and my mom called me a selfish and miserable asshole. Now I feel really guilty, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1685059195, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rxkbu/aita_for_calling_cps_on_my_sister_because_she/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was an extremely selfish and dangerous thing to do for her own children. Did she seriously expect an 8 year old to corral two much younger siblings? What if you hadn't even been home?

I would be interested to know how often your mother helps out or looks after the kids.\n\nBe clear with them both that you will no longer offer to babysit until your given respect and listened to, neither seems to recognize or appreciate the help given so far.

This is honestly one of the best-case scenarios.  Let's consider some of the other possibilities.  Imagine you weren't at home.  Those kids could have had to sit on your doorstep until she came back to retrieve them if you just didn't come home.  Or, someone could have grabbed them after she left.  You look out the peephole and don't see anyone there so you figure she left with the kids.  She doesn't hear anything from anyone and happily goes about her business thinking she got free babysitting for the day.  Eventually she returns for her kids and you have no idea why she's at your door asking for her kids when the last you knew they were with her.  Now, not only are her children missing, but it's already been close to a full day and she has to explain to the police and the rest of the family why she left her children outside someone's house and never once checked on them or notified the person that her children were there.\n\nHopefully she'll take this as a lesson and stop trying to force people into providing free babysitting.

She's ungrateful and selfish and just leaving her kids there was unacceptable. \n\nOn the other hand, you *are* family, and one single incident like this isn't really enough to warrant calling CPS. I'm not sure you understand how serious that is, and how much fracturing it's going to cause for everyone involved. It's a betrayal, and one you can't take back.
