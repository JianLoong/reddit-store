Lily was in the shower at the time so I knocked on the bathroom door and told her I was heading out to which she replied \"okay\" and I left.\n\nWhen I got home she came down the stairs as soon as I was in the door and started shouting at me for not locking the door, saying anyone could have come in. She had already been in the shower for about 15 mins when I left so I figured she would only have been a couple more minutes and it never even occurred to me that someone would lock the door while in the shower anyway. I told her that since we rarely get visitors that it was unlikely someone would have entered the house without permission in the few minutes she was in the bathroom.\n\nShe said I clearly didn't respect her privacy and stormed off into her room and has been given me the silent treatment ever since (this happened yesterday).\n\nI think she's overreacting but the fact that a usually chatty person has stopped talking to me is making me think I may be in the wrong. I asked my friends and they all think it's normal not to lock the door but they are all guys so idk if it's different. So AITA?\n\nETA: A lot of people are saying to always lock the door for safety. Usually she doesn't like the door locked as she goes outside to smoke a lot. When we first moved in I had to convince her to lock the door at night.\n\nETA 2: I think it may be important to clarify I have no problem with locking the door and will apologise later, I'm just concerned as she got more upset than I have ever seen her and I don't want this to damage our relationship. I am also going to make sure that we share all the boundaries we have so there are no more situations like this.\n\nETA 3: A couple of people have been confused by her attitude towards lock so I thought I would give some more context. If it were up to her the door would be unlocked all night while we are asleep so she wouldn't have to unlock it to go smoke. I have locked it when leaving while she is in the house before (earlier in our living together) and she got pissed at me for locking it while she is home\n\nSince posting this I've overheard some of her calls and comments as she walks about and it seems like this is going to get a bit dramatic ( I've heard her talking to people about possibly getting me kicked out and also talking to what i presume is her boyfriend (I heard his name) about coming over and moving my stuff). I thought my post was gonna be mundane so I wasn't going to do much editing of the post but if anyone is curious about what happens or has advice (The comments have taught me what i did was serious but i'm not sure I can be kicked out over it ) pls let me know.\n\nETA 4: May have caused some confusion in the comments. I have been reffering to it as the \"front door\" which to me it is. In all my groups we have always called the front door the one that you use however the door I mean is actually our back door into the garden. The real front door is always locked and blocked by a bookshelf. I know this changes nothing I just didnt want to correct all my comments.

By small, I mean population under 1000 people. 3 men from a bigger city, walked around one night, and tried handles to see whose house was unlocked.

I never lock my doors. My garage door is open half the time. And sometimes I leave my sliding door open when I go to the store in an unfenced back yard. I thinkbive even left the front door open when I drive my kids to work. It's how I grew up too. So, until reading the comments on this post, I never would have though to lock the door behind me when someone is in the shower. \n\nConsidering OP said she had to work with her roommate to get her to even lock the door at night, in what world would she know that the roommate would feel so adamant about locking the door while she is in the shower? The roommate apparently felt safe enough to sleep with unlocked doors, but not shower with unlocked doors.  \n\nI would say, let her calm down and then talk to her. I do not like to discuss things when I am in the heat of my anger. Once I've had time to settle, I can be reasonable and logical.

It is possible your roommate's normal is door unlocked for convenience, but locked for safety when I feel vulnerable.\n\nThis is not a reasonable position to expect others to parse; she has already demonstrated her vulnerability level is lower than yours, so it will be difficult for you to guess where the line is.\n\nIf you want to keep this roommate, then you will need to have a new discussion about the door.  Start with an apology: you know she felt unsafe when you left the door unlocked while she was showering.  You understand she felt vulnerable, and you regret putting her in that situation.  Explain that this was a misunderstanding; you thought she wanted an unlocked door at all times, and that she was accommodating you by locking the door at night.  Ask her to define her preferred locking policy.  \n\nThis is where it gets tricky.  If she only gives examples, try to extrapolate to a general rule.  While she's in the shower?  Ok, what if she's in the bathroom but not showering?  Napping?  Gone to bed for the night?  It's ok to add some rules for yourself too. \n\nA reasonable person will see where her previous communication lead to this outcome, and move on.  An unreasonable person who still wants to be your roommate will get over being scared and angry and take the opportunity to make things clearer.\n\nIf this talk does not work, then as painful as the change will be, this person is not a good person for you to live with.\n\nGood luck.", "If your leaving the home lock the door, and if she says anything just say you can't have it both ways you tell me to leave the door open and now you have an attitude about doing that same thing.\n\nIf you touch my things and move my things out I will be taking you to court and phoning the police.\nYou know for  an illegal eviction.\n\nIf you want someone to move, you move.\n\nYou can't have it both ways.", "NTA. Unless you guys had previously discussed this, it's just one person's opinions versus another's. Her feelings of being unsafe are valid, but she doesn't get to go off on you just because she never told you about this.\n\nHowever, yeah, keeping your doors locked is generally just a good idea. Apologize, talk to her about her expectations and how she responded to you, and move on.", "Uh NTA, I mean, my front door can't be opened from the outside and I'm assuming this is the case for all front doors? We lock it at night and when we're gone for a long time but never if we know someone's still home (I live with my partner and 2 housemates), but that's just to be extra safe because like I said, it's not like the door can be opened anyway.", "INFO - Does she not like the door being locked because she has to unlock it to go out and smoke?\n\nRegardless, this is a very specific situation. If you are going out and your roommate is in a vulnerable state (shower/bath, bathroom, sleeping, etc) then you should absolutely lock the door behind you. It doesn't matter that you never get visitors or if you live in a \"safe\" neighborhood...things still happen. It might seem like she's overreacting, but she probably just wants to get the message across.\n\nSomething you both could look into is changing the doorknob so that it's a keypad entry. They make locking mechanisms where the door is still locked from the outside, while the person inside can open the door (without disengaging the locking mechanism). She could go out and have her smoke, and then just key back in on the pad. I don't know what your front doorknob looks like, but they make ones that are easy to install and replace a standard doorknob.", "NTA if the norm is that the door is not unlocked, then why should she be surprised.

Even without all that extra context, your roommate doesn\u2019t need to flip out on you. I, a grown ass woman will not have another adult yell at me or talk down to me over a mistake.

You mention she gets mad if you do that when she\u2019s home, I say who gives a fuck if she gets mad, its two seconds to unlock the door for her to smoke.

If she had shared that with you calmly, it would be a new policy.   Y'all take some deep breaths.", "With the context of your edits and assuming you are being 100% truthful, I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA. Not if she has previously berated you for locking it while she's home. Yes I do agree the door should be locked, the door is always locked at our house for safety, but if this was not your norm and she has previously gotten mad at you FOR locking the door then how in the f were you supposed to know this time was different? As for those conversations with her bf and such, it sounds like, and I'm kind of assuming here, she is just searching for any reason to have you leave so that she can move her bf in. I've seen that type of thing happen too many times in stories/posts and in real life. I may possibly be wrong about that but it is what went through my head and I believe worth thinking about.\n\nETA: Your roommate's behavior reminds me of someone who wants out of a relationship but has no valid reason as to why so they make up petty reasons to be upset about so that they feel like less of an asshole when they dump the person", "Just apologize and tell her that you didn't consider locking it because she's gotten mad at you for locking before.\n\nBut you should lock it if you're leaving and she's in the shower.

I wonder if this triggered some sort of trauma for her.  She IS overreacting, considering she wants the door unlocked all night, but she may have an understandable reason for overreacting.

You had no way of knowing she'd do a complete flip.\n\nAnd yeah I do think she's being over dramatic.

Normally I'd say ESH but I think that context is very important and I don't think you can be blamed for not locking the door since she has literally conditioned you into never locking it during the day. Seems hella unreasonable to expect you to know she'd want it locked if she's showering, ESPECIALLY considering she didn't lock it before getting in the shower, which I think is another important context clue. \n\nPeople keep telling you YTA for not thinking to lock it because she was naked and vulnerable but SHE should've asked you to lock it if she wanted that, considering she gets mad about it in every single other circumstance. If anything, she should've locked it herself. Like if someone broke in and you were asleep or listening to music, they still could've walked in and seen her. She's a grown adult and if SHE wants something, SHE is the one who should make it happen. If she simply forgot, ASKING you nicely would make sense, but she said nothing.\n\nWhat does she do when you're not home and she decides to shower? I doubt she's locking it herself then, considering how much she hates locked doors. What's the difference between showering with the door unlocked and sleeping with the door unlocked? Cause if she had it her way, it'd be unlocked all night too. It just really doesn't make any sense that her and a bunch of people in the comments are upset with you for disregarding her safety or whatever when SHE'S CONSTANTLY DISREGARDING HER OWN SAFETY. \n\nAnd then for her to be not only so pissed off that she won't speak to you, but she's also insulting you behind your back and discussing kicking you out, all over one mistake that was far more her fault than yours. It's not like you already knew this was a boundary for her and did it anyway out of spite or something. You genuinely didn't know, and OF COURSE the thought didn't occur to you to lock it because SHE CONDITIONED IT OUT OF YOU. \n\nIf you want to keep the peace (personally, I think she's unreasonable and immature), I'd sit her down and explain why it didn't occur to you to lock the door, apologize (since APPARENTLY it crossed a boundary), and tell her you won't make the same mistake again.

It takes seconds to unlock from the inside, you leave it unlocked while you take a puff, go back in and it takes another few seconds to lock it again. and then she gets mad when you leave it unlocked? \n\nMy fiance used to leave the doors unlocked because his parents lived up the mountain and their neighbours were so far apart and it was all forested that they didnt worry about someone breaking in so he was so used to keeping doors unlocked, i had to drill it into him to make sure he locks the doors.\n\nI saw someone say that if someone wants to break in while you're home, a locked door isnt going to stop them. and while yes, if they were dedicated it wouldn't stop them, but it gives you a chance to either scare them away by making noise or calling the police or both, so i always always have to have the doors locked to feel safe, especially when i'm alone because i feel even more on edge then.\n\nYou were just doing what you thought your roommate wanted, it's not your fault she didnt specify the one time she wanted the door locked. definitely think she has ulterior motives for being this upset and for this long", "ESH.

I'm not gonna press her to explain why she sees it as different but it just confused me at first that it would be different", "You think they can hear anything at night while they are sleeping?   Op says the roommate would rather keep the door unlocked all night, because she smokes. \n\nIs one less then the other?  Why is the roommate okay with that (Ted bundy, night stalker, golden state killer) but flips out on this?  I\u2019ve said it before, the roommate doesn\u2019t Make sense.", "In Europe, front doors can only be opened from the inside, if you want to enter, you have to force the door open with a crowbar unless you have the key. There's an extra layer of security when you lock it since most doors have latches that block the door by locking themselves to the door frame, making it impossible to open unless you destroy the doorframe with the door and all,", "Maybe she doesn't feel quite so vulnerable when there's someone else (I.e. you) also at home? In the situation you've described she's naked, in the shower and all alone at home.", "im european, lived in several european countries and have never seen other doors than those that open with a handle from both sides and lock with a key from both sides.", "Her bf should not be in your room in your absence, nor should she. Suggest putting a lock on your bedroom door.\nNTA", "Same here. My housemates and I used to be laissez-faire about locking the door if we were in the house, only locking it at night and when all three of us were out. One evening when I was lying on the sofa and I could hear my housemates chatting in the kitchen I noticed a weird breeze. Got up and saw the front door was open. I closed it and I assumed one of my housemates hadn't closed it properly but I wanted to check on my cat because she's an inside cat and make sure she didn't get out. So I went upstairs and heard a person in my housemates room which was odd because I could still hear her in the kitchen. So I went in and there was a burglar. Had just walked into a house with lights on and very audible people in the downstairs of the house. I screaed and he got away (although police did later catch him because of him doing the same to several other people's houses). Since then I have been so paranoid about locking doors, I cannot sleep until I have checked doors, if I hear an unexpected noise I have to check all the doors are definitely locked. And like. I live in a safe neighbourhood supposedly and it was just one guy checking door handles for an opportunity, regardless of if anyone was in the house or not. So always lock your door because you never know what opportunists might be around.", "Why are you so hostile? And patronising! OP has been very reasonable in the comments. \n\nOP recently had to ask her housemate to lock the doors at night, but housemate continues to put OP in danger every night by coming back in from a smoke and going upstairs to sleep - leaving the door unlocked.\n\nHousemate is obviously plotting something, OP is not the bad guy here. Let's see if you can admit you were wrong to make assumptions and jump to conclusions like you accused her of. \n\nYes, ordinarily the door should be locked if someone is left alone in the shower. But in this particular situation? NTA all the way", "This is so bizarre! Who does shit like that!", "Lmao sometimes my cat will have the nighttime zoomies and I\u2019ll think I\u2019m getting robbed by some clumsy burglar", "It's amazing how much cats can sound people sized at 2am XD"]}
