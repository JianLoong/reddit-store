Lily was in the shower at the time so I knocked on the bathroom door and told her I was heading out to which she replied \"okay\" and I left.\n\nWhen I got home she came down the stairs as soon as I was in the door and started shouting at me for not locking the door, saying anyone could have come in. She had already been in the shower for about 15 mins when I left so I figured she would only have been a couple more minutes and it never even occurred to me that someone would lock the door while in the shower anyway. I told her that since we rarely get visitors that it was unlikely someone would have entered the house without permission in the few minutes she was in the bathroom.\n\nShe said I clearly didn't respect her privacy and stormed off into her room and has been given me the silent treatment ever since (this happened yesterday).\n\nI think she's overreacting but the fact that a usually chatty person has stopped talking to me is making me think I may be in the wrong. I asked my friends and they all think it's normal not to lock the door but they are all guys so idk if it's different. So AITA?\n\nETA: A lot of people are saying to always lock the door for safety. Usually she doesn't like the door locked as she goes outside to smoke a lot. When we first moved in I had to convince her to lock the door at night.\n\nETA 2: I think it may be important to clarify I have no problem with locking the door and will apologise later, I'm just concerned as she got more upset than I have ever seen her and I don't want this to damage our relationship. I am also going to make sure that we share all the boundaries we have so there are no more situations like this.\n\nETA 3: A couple of people have been confused by her attitude towards lock so I thought I would give some more context. If it were up to her the door would be unlocked all night while we are asleep so she wouldn't have to unlock it to go smoke. I have locked it when leaving while she is in the house before (earlier in our living together) and she got pissed at me for locking it while she is home\n\nSince posting this I've overheard some of her calls and comments as she walks about and it seems like this is going to get a bit dramatic ( I've heard her talking to people about possibly getting me kicked out and also talking to what i presume is her boyfriend (I heard his name) about coming over and moving my stuff). I thought my post was gonna be mundane so I wasn't going to do much editing of the post but if anyone is curious about what happens or has advice (The comments have taught me what i did was serious but i'm not sure I can be kicked out over it ) pls let me know.

You are young, and these things haven't happened in your world yet. \n\nSmall town a couple over from where we were living. By small, I mean population under 1000 people. 3 men from a bigger city, walked around one night, and tried handles to see whose house was unlocked. They came to a home with a mom and two teen children. They tortured the mom for a while. Ending in killing her and her children. They had no connection to these people.

Bad things can happen VERY quickly when you don't lock the door. Many years ago,my then-boyfriend left our apartment without locking the door because he was just going half a block away to get cigarettes.

I never lock my doors. My garage door is open half the time. And sometimes I leave my sliding door open when I go to the store in an unfenced back yard. I thinkbive even left the front door open when I drive my kids to work. It's how I grew up too. So, until reading the comments on this post, I never would have though to lock the door behind me when someone is in the shower. \n\nConsidering OP said she had to work with her roommate to get her to even lock the door at night, in what world would she know that the roommate would feel so adamant about locking the door while she is in the shower? The roommate apparently felt safe enough to sleep with unlocked doors, but not shower with unlocked doors.  \n\nI would say, let her calm down and then talk to her. I do not like to discuss things when I am in the heat of my anger. Once I've had time to settle, I can be reasonable and logical.

I\u2019d normally say yta and should lock it for safety reasons no matter what. but if she literally told you not to that\u2019s not your issue.", "Is the lock a regular lock you just put a simple key into and turn so the bolt goes into the door frame? If it is, that shouldn't even b3 am issue to discuss. It too simple.\nIf the lock is something similar to a bank vault's lock with several combinations locks, a dew key locks and some turning wheels, then I understand.", "NTA living with another person means finding the compromised everyone can live with when your habits conflict.  Your habit was to lock the door all the time, hers seems to have been to always leave it unlocked.  When she complained about the locked door, you compromised on locking it at night \n\nAll of that is observed fact.  From here I go to conjecture.  It is possible your roommate's normal is door unlocked for convenience, but locked for safety when I feel vulnerable.\n\nThis is not a reasonable position to expect others to parse; she has already demonstrated her vulnerability level is lower than yours, so it will be difficult for you to guess where the line is.\n\nIf you want to keep this roommate, then you will need to have a new discussion about the door.  Start with an apology: you know she felt unsafe when you left the door unlocked while she was showering.  You understand she felt vulnerable, and you regret putting her in that situation.  Explain that this was a misunderstanding; you thought she wanted an unlocked door at all times, and that she was accommodating you by locking the door at night.  Ask her to define her preferred locking policy.  \n\nThis is where it gets tricky.  If she only gives examples, try to extrapolate to a general rule.  While she's in the shower?  Ok, what if she's in the bathroom but not showering?  Napping?  Gone to bed for the night?  It's ok to add some rules for yourself too. \n\nA reasonable person will see where her previous communication lead to this outcome, and move on.  An unreasonable person who still wants to be your roommate will get over being scared and angry and take the opportunity to make things clearer.\n\nIf this talk does not work, then as painful as the change will be, this person is not a good person for you to live with.\n\nGood luck.", "If your leaving the home lock the door, and if she says anything just say you can't have it both ways you tell me to leave the door open and now you have an attitude about doing that same thing.\n\nIf you touch my things and move my things out I will be taking you to court and phoning the police.\nYou know for  an illegal eviction.\n\nIf you want someone to move, you move.\n\nYou can't have it both ways.", "NTA. Unless you guys had previously discussed this, it's just one person's opinions versus another's. Her feelings of being unsafe are valid, but she doesn't get to go off on you just because she never told you about this.\n\nHowever, yeah, keeping your doors locked is generally just a good idea. Apologize, talk to her about her expectations and how she responded to you, and move on.", "Uh NTA, I mean, my front door can't be opened from the outside and I'm assuming this is the case for all front doors? We lock it at night and when we're gone for a long time but never if we know someone's still home (I live with my partner and 2 housemates), but that's just to be extra safe because like I said, it's not like the door can be opened anyway.", "INFO - Does she not like the door being locked because she has to unlock it to go out and smoke?\n\nRegardless, this is a very specific situation. If you are going out and your roommate is in a vulnerable state (shower/bath, bathroom, sleeping, etc) then you should absolutely lock the door behind you. It doesn't matter that you never get visitors or if you live in a \"safe\" neighborhood...things still happen. It might seem like she's overreacting, but she probably just wants to get the message across.\n\nSomething you both could look into is changing the doorknob so that it's a keypad entry. They make locking mechanisms where the door is still locked from the outside, while the person inside can open the door (without disengaging the locking mechanism). She could go out and have her smoke, and then just key back in on the pad. I don't know what your front doorknob looks like, but they make ones that are easy to install and replace a standard doorknob.", "NTA if the norm is that the door is not unlocked, then why should she be surprised.

Y'all take some deep breaths.", "With the context of your edits and assuming you are being 100% truthful, I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA. Not if she has previously berated you for locking it while she's home. Yes I do agree the door should be locked, the door is always locked at our house for safety, but if this was not your norm and she has previously gotten mad at you FOR locking the door then how in the f were you supposed to know this time was different? As for those conversations with her bf and such, it sounds like, and I'm kind of assuming here, she is just searching for any reason to have you leave so that she can move her bf in. I've seen that type of thing happen too many times in stories/posts and in real life. I may possibly be wrong about that but it is what went through my head and I believe worth thinking about.\n\nETA: Your roommate's behavior reminds me of someone who wants out of a relationship but has no valid reason as to why so they make up petty reasons to be upset about so that they feel like less of an asshole when they dump the person", "Just apologize and tell her that you didn't consider locking it because she's gotten mad at you for locking before.\n\nBut you should lock it if you're leaving and she's in the shower.
