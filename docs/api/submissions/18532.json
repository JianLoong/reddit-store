{"id": 18532, "submission_id": "13vm1cv", "title": "AITA for telling my sister I would say \"I told you so\" if she gets cancer?", "selftext": "(sorry for errors, English is not my native language) \n\nI (f27) really enjoy motocross, and although I'm an amateur I spend a lot of my time and money on it. My sister (f31) has always kinda despised the sport. She is always saying that it's dangerous and that I shouldn't be doing it because I will get hurt. Three weeks ago I fell on a jump and broke my ankle and shattered my knee. It is still unsure what kind of recovery I will make, and I was (and still kinda am) mentally in a bad place as well. Like I said, I really love drifting around on my motorcycle and I would be devastated if I can never do it again. \n\nWhen my sister came to visit me at the hospital, the first thing she said to me was \"I told you this would happen.\" \n\nI was shocked by this, especially because she did not say anything else after that. No empthay or compassion at all, it almost seemed like she was happy to finally be proven right.\n\nNow onto the part where I think I might be the asshole. For context, my sister has been smoking cigarettes for the past 14 years. I have never really said anything bad about it, except for when she asked about it or tried to convince me of the benefits of it. So when she said \"I told you so\" to me at the hospital, I replied with \"nice response, I wil remember it for when you get lung cancer.\"\n\nShe got incredibly upset, called me a bitch and left. I have not spoken to her since, but I have gotten some angry texts from our parents saying that I crossed the line. I don't stand behind what I said because I would never do that to her if she would get lung cancer, but I meant it more as an example to show how insensitive her comment was. AITA?\n\nTLDR; I injured my leg during motocross and my sister said \"I told you so\", so I said that I would say the same thing to her if she gets cancer for smoking", "created_utc": 1685440859, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vm1cv/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_would_say_i_told_you/", "score": 8596, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's her choice, but she has been trying to sell it as something with benefits for years... And knowing her late sayings... No, you're NTA.", "Was your comment mean? Sure.

Your sister tried to convince you of the BENEFITS of smoking? Oh lawd have mercy! What benefits? Cancer? Grossing everyone around you out? Constantly reeking of smoke? \n\nYour sister is out of line for both what she said about your accident and also for trying to convince you to take up a nasty habit that comes with health consequences. You retorted a comment that is funny AF honestly and par for the course as far as things your sister would usually say to you. It was rude of her to come in on her stinky high horse and cut you down like that. She deserves more tbh. By chance, is your sister the golden child? Do you think she was 100% honest with your folks about what she said and what you said back? NTA x100\n\nHope you recover quickly and feel better soon!

Is it more important to be right than effective? \n\nOnce everyone cools off it is ok to share with her that you were in pain, worried about the future, and she said something that inflicted further pain upon you.

God forbid you give her a little clue of the feeling she gave you.", "NTA, perfect comeback!", "ESH. You both took the low road and you both found out the consequences.", "ESH. Were you TA? Yes. That's an asshole comment to make. Were you *justified* in being TA? Also yes, because your sister made a terrible, awful comment in a moment of weakness for you.

She is terrified you will be seriously hurt or die and she is scared she will lose you. \n\nYour actions were purely about planning to be being purposely vindictive at one of the worse moments of her life. \n\nNo one should be pulling \u201cI told you so\u201d when someone is down, but planning an \u201cI told you so\u201d to hurt a person freshly diagnosed with cancer is way worse than her saying it out of fear.", "ESH. Was she rude? Yes. But she has been warning you for years out of genuine concern. You simply wanted to be hurtful. Have you ever seen lung cancer in action? Believe me, watching her die if she gets it will be one of the worst things that\u2019s ever happened to you.", "Would you really say that if she developed a fatal disease? Cancer is a little more devastating than a broken ankle.  You both suck.", "NTA She was very insensitive in your predicament. What\u2019s up with your parents? Is she a golden child? They should stay out of this conversation.", "Nta", "NTA - but why are your parents still involved in your interactions at your age?", "NTA. I'm an older sister, I'd have pulled your sister from the room by the ear. Shameful behavior, that. Not *at all* the thing to say to a younger sibling in a hospital bed! Wait until they're on the mend, ffs! Then you can mock each other to your hearts' content. This was mean-spirited and that's that", "Esh no need to stoop to her level", "NTA", "Here's the thing: You can potentially die from a motorcycle accident and you can potentially die from lung cancer. She has a nasty habit and you have a very risky hobby. You both are at high risk for death. I honestly think that ESH.

No empthay or compassion at all, it almost seemed like she was happy to finally be proven right.\n\nSo this ***would have been*** normal to be upset over her doing.  Not saying anything other than \"I told you so\" during a visit would be rude AF.   Saying it at all is rude, but not saying anything else either is worse.  \n\nBut then you finally say this:\n\n> So when she said \"I told you so\" to me at the hospital, I replied with \"nice response, I wil remember it for when you get lung cancer.\"  She got incredibly upset, called me a bitch and left.\n\nYou replied right back and she immediately left.  Before you had implied she just was quiet or didn't say much else and sat around almost enjoying your misery.  Now it's clear she left because of the comment.  \n\nLet me be clear, the comment itself was warranted to toss back at her.  You were in the clear for that.  \n\nWhat you're not in the clear for is that you seem fine with wording things in ways to imply one thing when you know something else happened.   \n\nThe way people word their post is just as important as what happened, because it shows how the person thinks.  You're showing that you like to embellish and turn things your way for validation by implying someone else did more than they actually did.   If you had just stated what happened then this would be N T A but by making this into a slightly twisted story this becomes ESH.   \n\nAgain, by actual situation you were in the right, but once you try to twist some of the things that happen you also become an AH.  Don't do that.  Don't claim things like \"they didn't say anything else\" when you know that's because you replied to what they said.  There wasn't just dead air.  She clapped.  You clapped back.  She left because she couldn't handle her own medicine.
