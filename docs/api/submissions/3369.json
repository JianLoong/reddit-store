YTA.", "YTA. If we're talking about household things with a practical use, he's probably not hanging onto them out of sentimentality related to his marriage. Especially if that marriage ended horribly years ago. \n\nIt's probably some combination of a) he's being practical and doesn't want to spend money replacing something useful that's in perfectly good shape, b) he and/or the kids are sentimental about it because of the giver or c) he and/or the kids are sentimental about it because of the non-wedding-related memories associated with it over the years. \n\nSince he made the decision after speaking to his daughter, I'm guessing it's at minimum c, perhaps alongside the other reasons. All of those are good reasons that don't require a sinister or unloving motive. \n\nI'm genuinely sorry that you have a traumatic past that causes trust issues, but I don't see how trust even needs to be a factor here. There's no way he's going to leave you for his drug-addict ex who abandoned the family, whether or not he throws out the china. \n\nMeanwhile, you're not considering the feelings of his children who already have trauma related to one parent abandoning them and might have an issue with their father throwing out their childhood memories because his new wife is unreasonably jealous.

Omg you know that he had an entire life before he met you, right ? Your behavior is absolutely outrageous.", "Your emotions are valid, based on the experiences you\u2019ve had. HOWEVER, your abandonment issues are YOUR responsibility to address, and if they begin to interfere with what you describe as a great relationship, you need to address it sooner rather than later.

I wish you the very best!", "Soft YTA - this is a wedding gift from his deceased parents and he has been using it for over 20 years. The ex is long gone. Hopefully you can reconcile the two. MAYBE you can convince him to gift it to his daughter when she marries. But making a massive deal out of this is not worth it.", "YTA - they are just plates. They obviously don\u2019t hold significant meaning because you\u2019ve been together nearly a year and you\u2019ve only found out now.", "These are not just a wedding gift to remind him of his ex. This was a gift from his parents who have passed. They will probably be passed to his children as well. I don't think it's him trying to hold on to her, but a memory of his parents. Sometimes you have to pick your battles and I don't think you should pick this one.", "YTA.  This is why you don\u2019t get married after knowing someone for only nine months.", "Are you more of less than five years older than his children? Just wondering for science.", "YTA. You\u2019ve been with this man for what, a year? You\u2019re not entitled to tell him to get rid of some of his family\u2019s most precious possessions, especially since they\u2019re also some of his kids\u2019 most tangible links to their mom. \n\nI get that this is uncomfortable for you, but you went about this completely wrong. You really need to think about how his previous marriage is affecting your emotions, because this kind of insecurity isn\u2019t sustainable.", "YTA big time", "YTA how old are you?", "I hate to say this, but YTA. They\u2019re just dishes. That you only use on holidays. He\u2019s sentimental about them because they\u2019re from his late parents. \n\nHoliday dishes are such a waste of money, resources, and space, so maybe talk to him about only keeping them until his daughter is set up and can take them?", "YTA. I think you\u2019re focusing way too much on the ex-wife aspect. It was a gift from his parents that was used for family gatherings. His ex is no longer a part of the family, but that doesn\u2019t mean the china can\u2019t still be enjoyed. It\u2019s not a reflection on you that he keeps the china; it may still be meaningful for his kids, so it\u2019s important to him. By all means, get some new china, but don\u2019t demand he get rid of the china that\u2019s been in the family for years.", "YTA but I get where your coming from.  However they are just plates.  They mean something to him because they are from his dead parents, not because it was something he shared with his ex.  And they mean something to the kids, although they are grown, they are the plates they grew up using every holiday.  So it's a bit about tradition.  One day he can gift them to the kids when they start doing holidays of their own and you can have a set you share.  Remember she's an ex for a reason, you are married now and sounds like you have a happy relationship with this man.", "Soft YTA - when you are old enough to have children in their twenties, you end up with things you acquired with or from exes, former friends, dead relatives, other family, old jobs. These things are not necessarily sentimental, but yes, some of them are - like the china which came from *his deceased parents*.  He cannot erase his past. he cannot erase everyone he loved before just to appease the insecurity of a new partner. This is perhaps a reason you should not have rushed into marriage so fast - issues like this pop up when the initial glow has worn off, and they have a habit of becoming big problems.  Also, addicts have an illness. They may do hurtful things but they are ill. These children will always love their mother, and she will be present in some way and in them for the rest of your life. Can you handle that?", "Yta.  They are perfectly good dishes, why waste money buying new ones.", "YTA.  I have never had to throw away a plate because someone was jealous of it.", "YTA. Get some therapy so you will not be triggered by something like holiday plates that have good memories for the family.", "YTA. \n\nI have an ex like you. Who thought that anything from a previous relationship was to go. \n\nTo the point she went through my hard drive and deleted pictures including ones of my deceased father because my ex was in them. \n\nYou're absolutely the AH", "They\u2019re literally dishes\u2026why are you mad? If it means that much can you pass them onto one of the children and ask to buy new dishes? You seem to be one of those people who hasn\u2019t really encountered any real problems in your life. YTA.", "We have several items in the house that were used by my husband and his ex together. Some luggage, some cookware, books, etc.  I cooked dinner in one of the pots last night. Also, I note, he used to use his d1ck with her and I get a lot of use out of it now.  YTA for even bringing this up.", "YTA...they were a gift from his deceased parents...grow up...it's effing dishes.", "YTA - he had a long life and a family before you showed up. You can\u2019t just erase that.", "YTA. I still have a pair of my ex girlfriends joggers from about 12 years ago and my wife wears them. Why does it matter? He\u2019s allowed to have memories before you.", "YTA. This is a fight you won\u2019t win. You knew what you signed up for. Not using or throwing away a plate won\u2019t erase the deep history of his family. You gotta integrate. Build new memories. It seems there\u2019s missing info because again, it\u2019s just a plate. And his kids come from his ex too\u2026\u2026. She will always be a part of his life in some way shape or form.", "YTA. They are dishes, and if real china probably expensive dishes.\n\nI have seen people try to compete with ghosts of relationships past but dinnerware of relationships past is a new twist.", "YTA\n\nThey are a gift from his parents and he likely has family memories of using them that include his kids.  He has 20+ years of family memories, you cant expect him to throw everything away that his ex may have once touched.\n\nIt doesnt sound like he has any interest in getting back together with his ex - they divorced for a reason.  You dont need to be threatened by any reminders that she once existed.\n\nInstead of getting all upset over plates, focus on creating new memories with your husband.   Maybe you pick up mementos from a trip together or host a special dinner with unique wine glasses.   Also, take interest in learning about your husband's family memories and share some of your own family memories with him.  It all becomes less threatening to know you are just discovering more about one another.", "YTA, but just kind of. I think a lot of this is sentimental for his kids. It\u2019s not okay for you to pressure him to remove every part of his life that brings up memories of her. \nI don\u2019t even think the plates are meaningful to him in regards to his ex, but rather because they remind him of his parents.\n\nTry to start some of your own traditions with him. She\u2019s out of the picture (romantically, at least but maybe fully if she abandoned her family?) and you are now his wife. You\u2019re entitled to your feelings and it\u2019s hard to feel like her memory is lingering in the relationship but if he\u2019s been good about reassuring you that the meaning is purely sentimental and not a way to reminisce on what could\u2019ve been, they really are just items. \n\nConsider passing the dishes down to one of the kids (maybe the daughter since she feels so strongly) and buy a new set. You don\u2019t just get rid of expensive China. Also, and I mean this in a nice way, get some help for your own insecurities and past trauma.

Then it would still be in the family.", "NAH- you aren\u2019t TA for being hurt or for making requests. YWBTA if you can\u2019t accept his decision. It honestly sounds like he is discussing it with his kids and they aren\u2019t comfortable with it. Your husband may have some attachments to those items as well.

You say you understand that, but you have a problem with dishes that he has used every year at thanksgiving for decades? Why does it cause you pain? Is it more because it came from his parents and you didn\u2019t have the type of upbringing that he had? I\u2019m just very confused on how an inanimate object that is not an obvious sign of his forever life (not obvious like a photo would be) brings you to tears.", "This is so weird I have the exact same situation.

He sees those plates as gifts his parents gave him.\n\nYou have abandonment issues well into adulthood and chances are so do his kids.\n\nI kind of get where both of you are coming from.  I think you both need to have a serious conversation.\n\nIf his kids are no longer living in the home, I have a suggestion.  Many of these things you find triggering, he is keeping for his kids.  If that is the case, call the kids, put everything in one room and ask them to take what they want.  No point in waiting until dad passes to hand them down to the kids.\n\nIf there are things they don't want, then after they leave, you 2 need to discuss what to throw away, donate, and what to keep.  Please be sensitive that things like China, many people don't want due to limited use and lack of space.  However, your husband probably associates that with his parents and not his past marriage.  It is only fair he gets to keep some sentimental things.", "YTA - my mom still has wedding gifts from her first wedding in the 70s. She married my dad in the 80s, and she still had some of the nice gifts (not china, but similar). It never bothered my dad, and he was even an AH. Anyway, now they\u2019re divorced, and my mom has wedding gifts from BOTH weddings. I never thought it was weird. She doesn\u2019t have, like, framed wedding pictures hanging up or anything, but she definitely kept the nice cookware, some decor, and some quality handmade gifts given to them.", "Those are important to his family. You knew before you married him that he had a past family. Those dishes seem important to his daughters, representing their mother and grandparents. Maybe in time as they get older one of his daughters will want them. You need to seek counseling for your \"daddy issues\" if they are hurting your marriage, which it seems they are.  I'm sure through therapy you might be able to reach a compromise with your husband. They may be other ways you can start fresh and that counselor will be able to help you figure that out. This is just my opinion though.", "Why do you care?? It\u2019s plates. Your mental health issues are yours to deal with, nobody else\u2019s. Stop being ridiculous.", "YTA. Should he also get rid of his kids since his ex made them with him? \n\nYour entire tone sounds like you have really severe emotional issues that you need to address.

I just always asked if he wanted to keep or cared if I tossed as I always stumbled upon stuff whilst cleaning out closets/storage areas etc and was trying to get rid of stuff in general.

Right now you're hurting him for no reason.", "YTA\n\nYour being extremely sensitive? That's something for you and your therapist to work on. Partners are not supposed to be our therapist, or undo our damages. He has had a whole life before you. You both got married very very soon. there is much to his life that you simply don't know. You can't come charging in and pretend that his started when he met you.\n\nGet a therapist, work on your issues.

He is not responsible for managing your over sensitivity.  But the wedding dress is a little odd.  Is he a hoarder? Does he have problems letting go of things of value?   Does he just not even think about these things so they go unnoticed?  Again, if you knew him better, you would know the answer and not need us to tell you.", "Look - some hills you may choose to die on, others not. This is the latter. They\u2019re  plates, probably nice ones but still just plates. Maybe buy some new ones and gift those to the daughter.

The china reminds me of her but I don\u2019t let it bother me because I still love the dishes and I can make my own good memories with them to outweigh the bad.

All the this.", "Yes!! I do think OP already knows that this is their sensitivity shining through. It\u2019s dining-ware, it\u2019s not as if her husband still has his old wedding rind on.

I got my 12 place setting set with servers for $40. I am going to go with ESH. Moving into someone else\u2019s house is always hard and it\u2019s reasonable for your husband to let you get some new things to make it feel like your place too.

It should be in a trunk, put away, not something you see every time you grab the vacuum.", "Right? The rings and the bed are things that should be new.  I don\u2019t know anyone who has the resources to scrap everything they own and buy new. \n\nFfs the couch we had for 10 years was in my husband\u2019s bachelor pad and there were\u2026stories.

Not that weird to me.", "Or they\u2019re in a dorm or other temporary living situation. I\u2019d wait until the kids were in a home or apartment of their own. I can\u2019t imagine having china in a shared house with 3 other college kids (this is just the living situation I\u2019m imaging his kids are in).", "You make a good point. Perhaps a dry cleaner could clean it and preserve it in a box to be stored so that new wife does not have to see it every time she opens the closet.", "Agreed. My dad threw out my moms wedding dress without asking me. No, I wouldn\u2019t have WORN it (she was 4\u201911\u201d on a good day), but I might have tried to incorporate a piece into something for my wedding or do something else meaningful with the fabric. The kid is in her early 20s; she\u2019s not thinking of what it\u2019s like to get married without your mom on your wedding day (spoiler: it sucks) or where she\u2019s going to store it until then. He AT LEAST needs to ask before he trashes it. And if she wants it, maybe OP and husband can discuss a more out of the way place to store it, though next to old Xmas decorations sounds like it\u2019s pretty out of the way already", "That's also a really valid point. I also wonder about the style of the wedding dress.\n My mom had a really casual wedding dress that did just get kept in a closet since it wasn't a full sized or fancy dress that needed proper care. It stayed in the closet well after she passed up until just last year. It just wasn't worth the emotional journey to throw it away before and we might have had someone who wanted it at some point later like one of my nibblings when they get older.", "I'm sorry you missed out on that chance, I hope you still have something to connect you with her when the time comes. \n\nI also could never fit into my mom's dresses( the woman smoked like a chimney and was a size 0-2 because of it, at my smallest I've only been a 6) but he kept them any way even when I told him I could never fit them, he still thought I might just want them or to tailor them. He might not have been the best dad when she passed but he did what he could to help me keep mom in my life with her memories. \n\nOp should see her husband as the great man he is, allowing his children to keep happy memories of their mother."]}
