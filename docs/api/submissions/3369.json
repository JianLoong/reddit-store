You are directing lingering resentment and jealously towards them.  You need to talk to a therapist, individually, and probably a couples therapist as well.  \n\nYou got married to a man with adult children after dating for less than a year.

If his kids are attached to them it probably reminds them of their childhood or their grandparents. My mom is also an addict and I like having things like dishes from my childhood.

Nobody cares. I chose them, we all like them, and they\u2019re things. What are people supposed to do, get rid of all of their dishes and buy new?  What a waste. There aren\u2019t cooties or something contained in plates and bowls. \n\nYou\u2019re attaching too much emotion to things and not enough to where it counts - your relationship and love. Let the little stuff go.\n\nEdit: typo.", "YTA. GROW UP!! Seriously?? You\u2019re so hurt that he kept the China that his dead parents gifted. Get over yourself and realize that yours are not the only feelings that matter in this relationship.", "It's almost as if one should get to know the person they are marrying before getting all legally entwined. YTA.", "YTA. If we're talking about household things with a practical use, he's probably not hanging onto them out of sentimentality related to his marriage. Especially if that marriage ended horribly years ago. \n\nIt's probably some combination of a) he's being practical and doesn't want to spend money replacing something useful that's in perfectly good shape, b) he and/or the kids are sentimental about it because of the giver or c) he and/or the kids are sentimental about it because of the non-wedding-related memories associated with it over the years. \n\nSince he made the decision after speaking to his daughter, I'm guessing it's at minimum c, perhaps alongside the other reasons. All of those are good reasons that don't require a sinister or unloving motive. \n\nI'm genuinely sorry that you have a traumatic past that causes trust issues, but I don't see how trust even needs to be a factor here. There's no way he's going to leave you for his drug-addict ex who abandoned the family, whether or not he throws out the china. \n\nMeanwhile, you're not considering the feelings of his children who already have trauma related to one parent abandoning them and might have an issue with their father throwing out their childhood memories because his new wife is unreasonably jealous. Don't ask him to choose you over his kids when the issue is something so petty.", "YTA. \n\nYou want him, and the family, not to use stuff that is deeply sentimental, likely with a all sorts of holiday memories, why, exactly?

He sees it as a gift from his deceased parents, and his kids see it as a tradition from their childhood.  You\u2019re overreacting and need to figure out how to let this go.

You already tried to make him choose between getting rid of something that most likely has great sentimental value from his parents and he backed up on the decision. If backed into a corner & I had to choose, I would stick with the gift my parents gave me, and ditch the wife. He can get another wife, the parents are dead. \n\n Keep pushing & wife #3 might be throwing your stuff out.", "I don't think you're an asshole but your husband is not going to get rid of the china. You see the china and you see a reminder of his ex-wife. His children see the china as a reminder of past holidays and their childhood. It was a gift from his parents. He was his children's father and a son long before he met and married you and he's going to take his children's feelings into consideration.", "You're upset about dishes?

Stop being so dramatic. My mom kept her wedding china after she and my dad divorced. Used them for every single family gathering before passing them on to me. And yes, she was also in a new relationship.\nAgain, just plates.", "They're plates from his dead parents, i guess i understand why would would feel the way you do but, i think he keeps them for his parents, not his ex", "Info: \nHow old are you? And do you mean January of one year to October of the same year or was it in a different year? How long have you been together total?", "YTA. Omg you know that he had an entire life before he met you, right ? Your behavior is absolutely outrageous.", "Your emotions are valid, based on the experiences you\u2019ve had. HOWEVER, your abandonment issues are YOUR responsibility to address, and if they begin to interfere with what you describe as a great relationship, you need to address it sooner rather than later. FWIW, my husband did some therapy right after our wedding to try to meet his issues head on and it has made a world of difference in our relationship. I wish you the very best!", "Soft YTA - this is a wedding gift from his deceased parents and he has been using it for over 20 years. The ex is long gone. Hopefully you can reconcile the two. MAYBE you can convince him to gift it to his daughter when she marries. But making a massive deal out of this is not worth it.", "YTA - they are just plates. They obviously don\u2019t hold significant meaning because you\u2019ve been together nearly a year and you\u2019ve only found out now.", "These are not just a wedding gift to remind him of his ex. This was a gift from his parents who have passed. They will probably be passed to his children as well. I don't think it's him trying to hold on to her, but a memory of his parents. Sometimes you have to pick your battles and I don't think you should pick this one.", "YTA.  This is why you don\u2019t get married after knowing someone for only nine months.", "Are you more of less than five years older than his children? Just wondering for science.", "YTA. You\u2019ve been with this man for what, a year? You\u2019re not entitled to tell him to get rid of some of his family\u2019s most precious possessions, especially since they\u2019re also some of his kids\u2019 most tangible links to their mom. \n\nI get that this is uncomfortable for you, but you went about this completely wrong. You really need to think about how his previous marriage is affecting your emotions, because this kind of insecurity isn\u2019t sustainable.", "YTA big time", "YTA how old are you?", "I hate to say this, but YTA. They\u2019re just dishes. That you only use on holidays. He\u2019s sentimental about them because they\u2019re from his late parents. \n\nHoliday dishes are such a waste of money, resources, and space, so maybe talk to him about only keeping them until his daughter is set up and can take them?", "YTA. I think you\u2019re focusing way too much on the ex-wife aspect. It was a gift from his parents that was used for family gatherings. His ex is no longer a part of the family, but that doesn\u2019t mean the china can\u2019t still be enjoyed. It\u2019s not a reflection on you that he keeps the china; it may still be meaningful for his kids, so it\u2019s important to him. By all means, get some new china, but don\u2019t demand he get rid of the china that\u2019s been in the family for years.", "YTA but I get where your coming from.  However they are just plates.  They mean something to him because they are from his dead parents, not because it was something he shared with his ex.  And they mean something to the kids, although they are grown, they are the plates they grew up using every holiday.  So it's a bit about tradition.  One day he can gift them to the kids when they start doing holidays of their own and you can have a set you share.  Remember she's an ex for a reason, you are married now and sounds like you have a happy relationship with this man.", "Soft YTA - when you are old enough to have children in their twenties, you end up with things you acquired with or from exes, former friends, dead relatives, other family, old jobs. These things are not necessarily sentimental, but yes, some of them are - like the china which came from *his deceased parents*.  He cannot erase his past. he cannot erase everyone he loved before just to appease the insecurity of a new partner. This is perhaps a reason you should not have rushed into marriage so fast - issues like this pop up when the initial glow has worn off, and they have a habit of becoming big problems.  Also, addicts have an illness. They may do hurtful things but they are ill. These children will always love their mother, and she will be present in some way and in them for the rest of your life. Can you handle that?", "Yta.  They are perfectly good dishes, why waste money buying new ones.", "YTA.  I have never had to throw away a plate because someone was jealous of it.", "YTA. Get some therapy so you will not be triggered by something like holiday plates that have good memories for the family.", "YTA. \n\nI have an ex like you. Who thought that anything from a previous relationship was to go. \n\nTo the point she went through my hard drive and deleted pictures including ones of my deceased father because my ex was in them. \n\nYou're absolutely the AH", "They\u2019re literally dishes\u2026why are you mad? If it means that much can you pass them onto one of the children and ask to buy new dishes? You seem to be one of those people who hasn\u2019t really encountered any real problems in your life. YTA.", "We have several items in the house that were used by my husband and his ex together. Some luggage, some cookware, books, etc.  I cooked dinner in one of the pots last night. Also, I note, he used to use his d1ck with her and I get a lot of use out of it now.  YTA for even bringing this up.", "YTA...they were a gift from his deceased parents...grow up...it's effing dishes.", "YTA - he had a long life and a family before you showed up. You can\u2019t just erase that.", "YTA. I still have a pair of my ex girlfriends joggers from about 12 years ago and my wife wears them. Why does it matter? He\u2019s allowed to have memories before you.", "YTA. This is a fight you won\u2019t win. You knew what you signed up for. Not using or throwing away a plate won\u2019t erase the deep history of his family. You gotta integrate. Build new memories. It seems there\u2019s missing info because again, it\u2019s just a plate. And his kids come from his ex too\u2026\u2026. She will always be a part of his life in some way shape or form.", "YTA. They are dishes, and if real china probably expensive dishes.\n\nI have seen people try to compete with ghosts of relationships past but dinnerware of relationships past is a new twist.", "YTA\n\nThey are a gift from his parents and he likely has family memories of using them that include his kids.  He has 20+ years of family memories, you cant expect him to throw everything away that his ex may have once touched.\n\nIt doesnt sound like he has any interest in getting back together with his ex - they divorced for a reason.  You dont need to be threatened by any reminders that she once existed.\n\nInstead of getting all upset over plates, focus on creating new memories with your husband.   Maybe you pick up mementos from a trip together or host a special dinner with unique wine glasses.   Also, take interest in learning about your husband's family memories and share some of your own family memories with him.  It all becomes less threatening to know you are just discovering more about one another.", "YTA, but just kind of. I think a lot of this is sentimental for his kids. It\u2019s not okay for you to pressure him to remove every part of his life that brings up memories of her. \nI don\u2019t even think the plates are meaningful to him in regards to his ex, but rather because they remind him of his parents.\n\nTry to start some of your own traditions with him. She\u2019s out of the picture (romantically, at least but maybe fully if she abandoned her family?) and you are now his wife. You\u2019re entitled to your feelings and it\u2019s hard to feel like her memory is lingering in the relationship but if he\u2019s been good about reassuring you that the meaning is purely sentimental and not a way to reminisce on what could\u2019ve been, they really are just items. \n\nConsider passing the dishes down to one of the kids (maybe the daughter since she feels so strongly) and buy a new set. You don\u2019t just get rid of expensive China. Also, and I mean this in a nice way, get some help for your own insecurities and past trauma.

You barely know this man, I see a lot more problems and instances of you being overly sensitive in the future. Gifts are just that, gifts.

They are a reminder of those meals. \nSee if he will donate the dress to one of the places that turns them into outfits for stillborn babies. Or preserve it properly for his daughter at least, maybe in her own closet. \nBut the plates are just plates and getting a whole new set of holiday plates because you\u2019re upset that his first wife ate off them a handful of times is ridiculous.", "YTA.

I understand why this would be troubling for you, but I\u2019m thinking that the china set has more value as a gift from his parents who are now gone than a reminder of his ex. His daughter has also clearly attached sentimental value to them. There is no reason for you to be threatened by this and you should work past it. If you can\u2019t let it go and continue to ask him to get rid of them, then you would be TA.", "NAH. BUT  Keeping belongings from a family life before a second spouse is pretty normal, especially plates and using them is normal. While you. are not T A for being sensitive, you need to figure out why this bothers you so much because it does not have to. It is reasonable to ask to take down some pictures and not have videos be prominent, but asking to erase all of the wedding gifts from a prior marriage is not. His own parents gave that gift to him and his ex; this was not a random gift, not only to the ex, and it may represent his parents to him.", "Yta, you're jealous of dinnerware?\n\nWhat next, he gets rid of the kids because you're too sensitive to have them around?", "YTA - Your husband had a life before you entered the picture, and that life involved a first wife, who was his children's mother, despite apparently abandoning the kids.  (You don't mention what age she did that - if the first wife turned to drugs later in life, they might still have happy memories of early childhood with her.)  Do you really expect your husband to throw out everything that he and his first wife bought or received as a couple? \n\nAnd I find this line very concerning - \"He said he\u2019d give them away but after conversing with his daughter he has now changed his mind and states he will not give them up EVER even as he sees my tears.\"  It sounds like his daughter WANTS the china to be saved, possibly for her to use some day, and but you think your husband should cater to you because you cried over it.  And it came from his recently deceased parents?  Who cares if it was a first wedding gift, it's obviously a memento of his parents, and his children's grandparents!   \n\nYou need to REALLY tread lightly here.  Things like videos and pictures of the first wedding are irreplaceable mementos for both your husband and his children.  If you move in and try to erase all memories of their mother because of jealousy, the children will likely never forgive you.  Do NOT take it upon yourself to throw any of that stuff out, you have no right.  If the photos are displayed around the house, maybe you could ask your husband to box them up and put them safely in storage for the children to have later.\n\nI realize it's possible that your husband has not moved on, and I can understand feeling insecure if, say, there's some shrine left up to his first wife.  Or if there are wedding pictures mounted on the wall in every room.  But you just say pictures, videos, plates \"left around the house,\" which could just mean that there's a wedding album and video left on the shelf in the office.  Do you expect him to burn it all in the backyard or something?  Given that you are throwing a fit over china plates, I suspect that either something else is going on, OR you are deeply jealous, insecure, and self-absorbed, and feel the need to completely erase and overwrite the memory of the first wife, regardless of how that might negatively effect \"the love of your life\" and his children.  Maybe instead of insisting he throw things out, you could add some of your own stuff?  Surely you have your own gifts from the wedding that were added to your household, establishing your presence there.  You will gradually make your own memories with your husband that will add to, not overwrite, the memories that are already there in the house.", "YTA and an insecure one at that. I constantly marvel at these people who think that if their partner is divorced or widowed they are obligated to get rid of perfectly good and/or useful items because of some \u201cassociation\u201d with the previous marriage. \n\nPeople really think they can \u201chold on to someone\u201d by digging their claws in and demanding every bit of their attention. There is absolutely NOTHING you can do to hang on to someone who decides, for whatever reason, that they no longer want to be with you.

It sounds like she moved in with them, and no matter how welcoming they might be, she's having to adjust to their ways, likely in 1000 tiny ways that add up, like what time they eat breakfast and what they choose to eat.  All that those things--like catering to new people's wants while grocery shopping--add up. And there's strain in being in a new role, and shock, especially for someone who, like OP says she and her new husband never even fought prior to marriage.  So none of this is about the china!
