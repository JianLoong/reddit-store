To start off, I have a fever and don't feel like cooking, so I figured I'd order pizza (depending on the price).\n\nSo, I contacted a local pizza shop and ask about the price of 2 items on their menu. They tell me the price is about $20 or something. I say alright, thank them, they sent me a thumbs up emoji, and that's the end of it. I've ordered from them at least 3 or 4 times before and I ALWAYS pay via bank transfer.\n\nFor context, I live in Europe, and you can order from them via WhatsApp. No problem!\n\nI decided I wanted to save $20 in my pocket and cook. I was cooking for 30 minutes then I hear the doorbell. I asked my dad if he was expecting any packages and he said no.\n\nI had no clue who it could be. My mom answered the door, and it was the pizza man with the same items off the menu I asked the price for.\n\nShe explained that no one had ordered anything and kindly saw the man off.\n\nMinutes later, I get a call from the pizza place asking if I ordered. I told them that I hadn't, and I only asked for the price of the items and that was it. He read out my address and I again told him I didn't order. I was calm and figured they made a mistake.\n\nUntil he hung up on me. Atp, I'm annoyed because what the hell was that about?? Then I get a text.\n\nGuy: \"The pizzas at the door.\".Me: \"I didn't order anything from you at all, I just asked for the prices. I always pay before I order.\"Guy: \"We drove 6km to deliver your order\".\n\nNow I'm pissed because how are you going to HANG UP on me, deliver me something I NEVER ordered, then COMPLAIN about how long it took to get here? How?\n\nI'm not trying to be an ass and cuss him out and text:\n\n\"Again, I didn't order from you all. I ASKED what the prices were from the items. That's it. I never confirmed anything, and you can see the messages between us stating nothing of the like. You won't have to worry about me ordering in the future because I won't be ordering again. Have a good day.\"\n\nI blocked them after that.\n\nI vented to my mom about the argument, and she said that it wasn't my fault since I didn't ask, nor did they even call to say they were on the way or confirm anything with me.\n\nHowever...I felt kind of like an asshole for not paying for the pizza (6km is a long ride). Then again, I NEVER asked for it in the first place and didn't even have the money on me at the time to pay for it even if I wanted to (I always pay with card, I don't hold cash).\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n**Edit #1**: I've seen from several folks that 6km is indeed, not a long ride. In the moment I felt bad since to me, with the guy's text, it was an inconvenience to the driver and essentially all for nothing. On top of that, I do not at all drive (I drove once...that was enough for me, I'm scared to lol) so I'm not good with distances / the mathematics behind it tbh.

Don't feel guilty for that", "NTA.

You aren't responsible for their mistake.", "NTA\n\nBut if I were you, don't order from here again or someone will probably make your pizza shitty, or even do something to it.", "NTA. Legally there was no contract here. You had offer but no acceptance. Asking for a price quote and then thanking the seller for providing a price quote is not a commitment to buy, it doesn't work like that anywhere.", "NTA  \nAlso, 6km is not far at all .  \nFor reference a good runner can do that in 25 mins. A beginner in 40. So I'm guessing the drive was maybe 5-10 minutes.\n\nThe restaurant misunderstood, it happens, I don't think this is an issue to worry about in the slightest", "NTA, and 6km is not a long ride for a delivery. You clearly stated your question, you asked about pricing. That\u2019s not an order\u2026 that\u2019s what someone does to call around and get the most for their money (especially with global inflation right now) Please do not feel like an AH at all\u2026 you are the furthest from it. Also check with local laws and see if they broke a law or ordinance. This is inertia selling and is illegal in many countries around the world. It\u2019s also bad business practice", "Nta\n\nBut the big question is, did they just leave the pizza there?", "I wanna say NTA here. That's... shady. Unless someone specifically says \"I would like to order this item\" then it is not an order, it is an inquiry. Sure it sucks the company is now out $20 but context matters. Hopefully they will be more careful in future endeavors.", "This reminds me of a time in my life when I was getting Dunkin Donuts breakfast sandwiches every morning on the way to work, to the point that the staff were friendly with me and knew my order. One morning I decided I was going to just get a coffee - try to break the habit - only to find that they had started my regular order as soon as they saw me go in through the door. I just paid for it because I liked the place and appreciated the gesture.\n\nYour situation is a little different but if you liked the pizza, it may have just been better to pay for it in order to preserve the relationship.\n\nUltimately though, you are NTA - you were just asking for a price check. The pizza place is the AH not for misreading your text, but for doubling down and complaining, which is unprofessional and unhelpful in the face of clear evidence.", "ESH.  Your communication was just vague enough that they could have concluded you were placing an order.  Agreeing with price typically means \"I'll take it\".  If the customer is a regular, then it's even more correct to think that agreeing to the price is AN ORDER.  However, the situation was a bit vague.  If I'd have been on the phone, then after you placed the order...\n\nI would have confirmed by saying something like, \"We can deliver in 30 minutes...will that be OK?\"  That gives you an opening to back out, if I misunderstood you.  And it allows me to confirm that I understood correctly, also.\n\nWhat we have here is a failure to communicate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe had you said thank you, I haven\u2019t decided yet whether to order or not but will call you back if I decide. That would have been harder to misunderstand. Not blaming you or them.

They didn't confirm the order and you didn't confirm you only wanted prices. It is reasonable to assume that after asking prices if someone says \"ok\" that they want the order.

I remember a time my Great Grandma was working in a restaurant. And, apparently, some customer was disrespectful to the chef.

If the business makes no efforts to retrieve the package, depending on where you live, it will legally become yours within a few months (where I live it's two, but that may vary).
