People are so bizarre.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with these people.  Do your best to ignore them.\n\nYou probably could have left off the part about it being good that they died.  It\u2019s always best to take the high road.\n\nNTA.", "Clearly NTA.  In the future, if you see a tiger, prolly best not to poke it. These people aren\u2019t your family, you owe them nothing, not even a response.", "NTA, I'd have done the same probably", "NTA - this story is so crazy. I'm glad there was a happy ending and that you are keeping it that way by telling them to F off.", "NTA. Don\u2019t engage with them in the future. These kinds of people do not get better or learn and will only cause your family stress in the future.", "INFO: Why do you feel like you're the asshole?", "NTA.  Cole and James are lucky to have you for a son.  There's clearly a lot of love in your family, and Cole's parents chose not to be part of that.

Also, I grew up Christian, and the biblical definition of whirlwind definitely has more End Times Mayhem connotations to me.  \n\n Like, a tornado is definition a category of whirlwind. Waterspouts, firewhirls and dustdevils are also classified as lesser types of whirlwinds.  \n\nSo in theory, a reaped whirlwind can drown the reaper in the consequences of their own actions, or burn their shit down, or whatever category of whirlwind  is most fitting. \n\nWhirlwind is (in my opinion) the more accurate (and poetical term) term in this scenario.", "Thank you all for this pedantic, mildly hostile, wholesome argument.", "Mild?  What do you think a fucking \"medium hostile\" conversation is tho?", "NTA, their actions wouldn't be out of place in a psychological horror.", "NTA. \n\nA lot of people feel entitled just because of things like blood. I went through something weirdly similar given the differences - an evil grandparent I had to cut out of my life, accusations that one parent made me evil 'like them', etc. \n\nIt's really hard. I tell myself over and over \"Blood of the covenant is thicker than water of the womb\". But when someone is **supposed** to be *\"family\"*, you crave that connection anyways. So it hurts when it's no good, just as this is, especially when you're so young. Stay strong and hold your parents close, you did the right thing.", "NTA. The world clearly still has some more homophobes to lose in that family.", "NTA. You're better having none of those evil people in your life.\n\nThis is such a terrible story and I'm glad everything worked out in the end but only after so much cruelty on the part of (I assume) 'loving christians'.", "NTA. The worst I can say about you is that your response wasn't exactly strategically sound. I could have told you they'd retaliate disproportionately to your remarks. But you're 17, and I can't fault you for for not necessarily thinking one comment through.\n\nTo clarify: I'm only saying your comment may have kicked a hornet's nest. I'm not saying those hornets didn't deserve a little jostling, just that deserve it or not, they're gonna try to sting.

My only advice (to you and everyone else here): don't feed the trolls. They deserve only silence and blocking. Nothing comes from trying to reason with the unreasonable, or trying to explain your family's justified desire to be apart from them, except they will need to escalate to justify to themselves their hateful viewpoint; I think you have observed this now in their reaction.", "NTA wtf", "NTA, even a little bit\n\nAnd their response, saying you are evil like your father, is proof of you needed it. \n\nTake care of those healthy boundaries, kiddo.
