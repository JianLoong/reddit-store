Your family don't owe anything to Cole's parents.", "NTA because they literally tried to ruin your parents relationship and only want to contact you because they think your biological father is one of your dads and that just sucks I\u2019m sorry this is happening", "NTA \n\nSounds like they were legitimately evil people who would have rather seen their son sick and braindead than healthy and gay", "NTA. Family are not people who you share genes with, family are the people who love and support you. \n\nThe really telling thing is that the people (I won\u2019t call them your family) created more accounts so that they could continue to harass you - this is not the actions of people who actually care, this is the action of people just looking to hurt someone else. \n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI gotta know, though, did Cole stay in touch with the cousin? I feel like the cousin is the hero in this story.", "Your feelings are valid and why in the world would they think you would want to have any type of contact with them?  The only person who I can see you have a relationship with is the cousin who stepped in and did what was right.   \n\nOnly good vibes to you and your dads.", "NTA. Not even a little bit. You're showing strength and maturity that is beyond your years. I'm so glad your cousin helped to reunite your dads so that Cole could recover. You should like you have a wonderful family without the presence of Cole's bigoted blood relatives. Keep doing what you're doing and loving each other through it all.", "NTA.

Probably Southern Baptists.\n\nNo, absolutely NTA. These people weren't just delusional, they were psychotically abusive. They attempted to abuse a man in his weakness into never recovering from amnesia because it would \"save his soul,\" and that's just hideously, monumentally, disgustingly evil. Worse yet is they were never sorry, and still think they were doing the right thing. Your fathers are human beings, but they were treated like vermin and experimental subjects by Cole's relatives.\n\nThey deserved to be given the cold hard truth, that you don't lament the loss of people you've only known about through one of the worst things they've done. Which, some might consider unfair, but then again we don't remember hitler as a lover of animals, artist, vegetarian, or romantic. We remember him for the holocaust.

You have zero bio link to them, nor were they ever an actual part of your life, nor did they seem to really want any part of yours since they refused to try and make amends with your fathers.

And then continued to keep harassing you all. \n\nThey didn\u2019t deserve your empathy and I hope you and your dads can forget about it now they have all been blocked too.", "WOW!  NTA.  How can these people live with themselves?  It sounds like the whole family was homophobic.  IT's disgusting that people still think it's ok to just cut someone off bc of their sexual preferences. It's awful the things they did to James & Cole.  Just horrible.  I'm so sorry you have to deal with this.", "Definetly NTA\n\nI can \"understand\" some reasoning behind the family of Cole, as in I see the \"logic\" they applied, though as far as this history goes, what you have done was ABSOLUTELY right and dare I say very fitting!\n\nI can understand some thoughts and issues about this whole situation, but the family was clearly more interested in having Cole fit back into that mold they think is right, yet never actually cared for what made him happy or healthy.\n\nThese people are the actual EVIL here, when they couldnt get their own family member, their sibling, back into grieving about their loss, they went after YOU, who had the least contact or relationship with the deceased!  \nThey tried to strong arm you into this BECAUSE they thought you were young and susceptible! Yet it nicely backfired and then they project their own inability to accept this unto your family and call you evil. This is about the best kind of indoctrinated projection I have ever seen.\n\nI hope you and your family keep yourself safe and wish you nothing but the best for the future!", "YTA for writing like that \u2026\nNTA for what you said", "Your grandparents were certainly undeserving of your time, patience, and affection, but their children loved them dearly and are grieving  Yes, they acted shamefully and unforgivably.  It's odd how you think returning the favor makes you a better person.\n\nYou are under no obligation to attend the funeral, or to offer the mourners any comfort or support.  But you didn't have to act so cruelly toward them.  Imagine how you'd feel if your dad died and one of your relatives decided to tell you they were glad the world had one less homosexual? \n \nPart of being a good person is not taking pleasure in others' pain, even those who you think deserve it.   I'm not suggesting they've earned forgiveness, but celebrating their loss to their face is a dick move.  \n\nYou have no control over how others act, only how you react.  \n\nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
