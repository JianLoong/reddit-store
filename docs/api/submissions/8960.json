I know bc I just went for a friends birthday (President's wkend) and plan on going back Easter wkend bc i'm off. I researched a lot prior bc it was my first time going as an adult and I like to get bargains whenever I can. Disney purposely prices their tickets as the highest tier when they know it's a popular time so Halloween tickets will be expensive and the same price no matter when you buy it.", "LOL your friend is trying to scam her way through a Disney wedding and is going to get banned from the parks.\n\nFirst, Disney tickets aren't cheaper the earlier you buy them.  They're adjusted on a sliding rate based on the date and how crowded they think the park will be.  The weekend around Halloween is generally pretty close to top tier prices.  That makes me think she may be trying to buy them from resellers, which can be a scam where you end up buying tickets that are already used.  The Disney World system is way more rigid about ticket resellers than Disneyland, but you can still easily get skunked through this now that they've removed the requirement for single day reservations.  And if she's looking specifically for Halloween night (about 4pm until closing time), that could be a separate hard-ticketed event price, probably around $200 per person if it's based on last year's prices.  A park ticket for Halloween day could be a separate price from Halloween night's party.  This would depend on the park she wanted to get married at, what special events Disney decides on, etc.\n\nSecond, planning a wedding in the park is very much not advised, and if they're found out or make a big deal about it, they will most certainly get banned for life.  Disneyland is private property, and all weddings must be organized through their system.  It's one thing if they quietly stand with a single officiant where nobody is going to notice, but anything with a bunch of guests or matching outfits or whatever is going to be a \\*problem\\* for Disney staff.  Traditional wedding dresses and tuxedos - if they're going that route - could get them denied entrance at the gate, especially if there are bridesmaids/groomsmen with them.  Disney goes through a lot to make sure that people are not coopting their parks to have events without paying, so it's going to be difficult for them to successfully pull it off.  Even just a basic search of \"can I get married at Disney unofficially\" will bring up numerous reasons why it's not recommended.\n\nHere's a thread at The Knot discussing possible sneaky wedding methods - [https://forums.theknot.com/discussion/663954/walt-disney-world-secretly](https://forums.theknot.com/discussion/663954/walt-disney-world-secretly).

Would there be any kind of reception because theme park restaurants are either extremely crowded kind of food stands or require reservations and have limited seating - they aren't set up for receptions or parties unless you book one of the spaces.\n\nBut obviously OP is NTA because you don't have to attend any wedding and certainly not a destination wedding. My understanding is that people assume that most people are going to decline except immediate family and very close friends."]}
