You need to buy your ticket in June!\u201d\n\nMy problem is I pay a good amount in monthly living expenses and, June and October are costly months for me in general as it stands. I can only imagine the hiked prices for Disney in Halloween on top of that.\n\nI also am not the biggest fan of Disneyland in general and would not intend on staying in the park in general after the wedding so that also holds to my reluctance to spend money on it. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be an asshole but ultimately it feels weird in general to hold your wedding somewhere that people would need to pay that kinda money to attend in the first place.\n\nTL;DR Friend wants a Destination wedding at Disney but wants guests to pay for the tickets to attend.\n\nUPDATE: So a few more things.\n\nShe claims the tickets will be cheap if they\u2019re ordered ahead of time thus why she said buy in June because  can\u2019t even buy for October as of right now to verify that claim which has me more reluctant\n\nI am lead to believe they are planning to use their own officiant in the park which I am pretty sure is not allowed.\n  \n\nAnd I also did say to her \u201cHey -friend- I love you but I have a lot of costs in general and I expect October to be costly for me as it stands, I don\u2019t think I could afford a Disney ticket on top of it\u201d \n\nFor her initial response to be \u201cLol well thats what were doing and if you cant you cant\u201d which knowing her was meant to be sent with attitude about it. \n\nI just feel like there are so many red flags in this all together now.", "created_utc": 1675358743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rve4k/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_a_ticket_to/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not obligated to spend money you don't feel you can spend.\n\nPeople who have destination weddings should accept that a lot of their invited guests may not be able to attend. They should be prepared for that reality. If they get mad at you for not forking over hundreds of dollars to be their guest, then they're the AHs.  \n\nIt's really as simple as that.", "NAH. Any wedding invite is yes/no optional. And this was just a text, not even an invitation. \n\nIf you want to open a can of worms about it now, go ahead and tell her you're out.  Or just wait until you get an invitation and RSVP no.", "NTA. Nope, I'm not paying to go to a wedding. Especially the phrasing of the text. You're just being told, instead of being asked, that you are booked and your money is going to be spent. Like your input is not required.", "NTA. Fully of the opinion if your wedding is going to cost guests extras liket that you as a couple pay for it. Disney tickets are stupid expensive. Then travel likely on top of it and gifts, clothing, etc. Nope.", "NTA as destination weddings are intentionally held to reduce both costs and headcount. As a guest attending a destination wedding, certain expenses are your responsibility, such as food, lodging and theme park attendance. The wedding ceremony and reception will be paid for by the hosts, but the hosts are not responsible nor does etiquette dictate that the hosts pay for lodging and related expenses for guests. \n\nYou\u2019re also NTA if you decline this invitation due to the cost of attendance. Destination weddings are expensive for everyone who attends.", "What if they cancel or change the date. Just one reason you're NTA", "NTA\nThat's a big expectation for guests to pay for a Disney ticket bruh. If you don't have the money to finance that then as your friends they should understand.\nI mean they should expect that not everyone can able to afford such luxaries. Hopefully they're sound, and celebrate with you another time and place.", "NAH\n\nFunctionally it's just a destination wedding. Destination weddings always mean some people can't attend.", "NAH\n\nDisneyland is a fine place to get married: there are no rules. \n\nAsking people to come and pay for their own ticket is also fine, as long as they don\u2019t get annoyed when people refuse, and there\u2019s no indication that this happened.\n\nYou not wanting to go for the reasons you mentioned is *also* fine. \n\nJust politely say that you can\u2019t afford to come. That\u2019s all that\u2019s needed.", "NTA. Declining an invitation, especially to a destination wedding, due to the costs doesn't make anyone an A H", "NTA, expecting someone to overstretch themselves financially so you feel good is selfish.", "INFO: Is the wedding in the park? How does that even work?", "NTA. It\u2019s a wedding invite not a subpoena. You are not obliged to do anything but rsvp in a timely manner.", "NTA. You effectively are being asked to pay to attend someone\u2019s wedding and it probably isn\u2019t a small token amount either. As her wedding she should be covering that cost if she wants people to attend.", "NAH\n\nThis is no different than a destination wedding in Fiji or Italy. Some people love that sort of thing, and some hate it. No one\u2019s an asshole for it.", "NTA\n\nThose who cannot afford and do not want to spend money, shouldn't. But reign in your judgement about what she should and shouldn't plan for her wedding. Just choose not to attend and be done with it.", "NTA But I also think a reasonable option is to say- basically- oh great. you know, i think it's awesome how you think that everyone's presence at your wedding is the perfect wedding gift for you and your SO. I'm so glad that all I need to worry about is the cost of the disney ticket cuz otherwise I definitely wouldn't be able to swing it. i'm so glad i can be with you guys on your special day.\n\njust as if obviously if you are going to have your wedding someplace where this is an upfront cost to your guests, clearly if the bridal couple isn't paying it's because you showing up is the wedding present.", "NAH (unless the friend gets mad you cannot go, then it would be N T A). Destination weddings are a thing, so not wrong of them to invite you. But, if a couple goes with a destination wedding, they can't get miffed if they get a lot of declines, imo.", "NTA if they want to get married at Disney they need to pay for the tickets if whoever they invite. Just like the bride and groom would pay for food or appetizers not have the guests pay for their own plate. They wouldn\u2019t expect y\u2019all to pay to rent the venue if they were getting married at another venue, they shouldn\u2019t expect y\u2019all to pay for Disney tickets. \n\nAlso I can\u2019t stand Disney parks they are over crowded and expensive. I would decline to go right off the bat if I was told that is where it will be.", "NAH:  You don't have to go, you have that option. But if your friend wants to have a wedding at Disneyland good for them that sounds pretty awesome actually", "NTA\n\nIf you want to go, I'd ask if there is a group discount rate because I find it strange they would book a wedding at Disney but it doesn't include passes for the friends and family attending. \n\nIf you don't want to go because you find it ridiculous, just tell her you won't be able to make it and send them a gift.", "NTA : also it gives you the occasion to skip a wedding at disneyland\u2026 sounds awful", "NTA if you decide to get married in Disneyland, you gotta pay for people yourself, you can not expect them to buy tickets themselves.", "You can decline to attend.  Not wanting to go is enough of a reason.  Finances are even more of a good reason.\n\nNAH", "NAH\n\nThey invited you, it doesn't work for you and you can't attend.\n\nIt's not an ahole move to decline a single event. It's called an invitation, not a forced summons", "NTA. Disneyland is a kid's park in general. It's a strange place for a wedding.", "NAH. Just send your regrets. \n\nTraditionally the host takes on any venue related expenses associated with a wedding other than lodging for guests. Times and traditions do change though so I am not going to pass judgment on the couple getting married. Weddings are an opt in event and it is always acceptable to politely decline an invitation, especially for financial reasons.", "NAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People who have destination weddings, whether it's some exotic locale on the other side of the world or a ridiculously overpriced theme park, need to understand that not everyone is willing to pay for the mere privilege of attending their wedding.

It costs money to attend a wedding, even if the wedding is at a local venue. If you don\u2019t have an outfit that fits the dress code, you have to buy one. You have to pay for gas and possibly tolls to get to the wedding. If the venue doesn\u2019t have free parking, you usually have to pay for that on your own. Plus you\u2019re expected to bring a gift for the happy couple. An invitation is not a summons. If you can\u2019t afford to attend an event, you decline the invitation and the hosts should respect that.", "Genuine question: how is this different from having your guests pay for their own travel and lodging expenses for a destination wedding or having guests pay for their own parking if you get married at a local venue? This is kind of the same thing. When I attend a wedding I only expect a free meal and drinks. I assume that everything else is on me.", "Or, this may sound crazy, those people who can't afford it or don't want to pay...don't go", "People have weddings there all the time.

It\u2019s also hard to get your desired wedding date because it\u2019s such a popular venue. Your friend is probably trying to get around those issues by planning an unauthorized wedding. She might think that once the ceremony has started, the staff won\u2019t try to stop it. She\u2019s very wrong about that and she\u2019s going to get you all thrown out of the park. You\u2019re wise to skip this inevitable train wreck.", "It's not allowed and can result in a lifetime ban from the parks.  Getting married on hotel grounds (in WDW in FL) happens more often and there are plenty of officiants who offer the service.  But inside the parks is a big no-no, and the castmembers will stop the ceremony if they see it and escort you out.  (former \"Friend of Mickey\")", "Honestly you might want to ask in a Disney sub, not for advice on whether you should go but on exactly what expectations will be on you as a guest and what they think the person might be imagining. I have to wonder if you're right that this is just a quickie thing without paying for anything official, but not sure how well that will work out for them if their list is bigger than say a dozen people.\n\nThat being said, I could equally see something where they're getting married in a venue that's not actually within the park but presuming that guests will want to visit the park or intending for their guests to visit the park with them after the ceremony.\n\nI don't think it would make you the asshole to clarify logistics here, like \"That's so exciting! I'm so happy for you! I do have to check on scheduling/budgeting and get back to you but also - is the wedding in the park or another venue? I'd love to attend but not sure I can swing Disney tickets at the moment. But either way I'm so so excited for you and Name!\" You could also ask if they're registered anywhere or directly say that you do want to give them a gift, if you want to soften it further and are okay with committing to the cost of a gift.", "It wasn't even written as an invitation.

That\u2019s not mentioned in their post. OP\u2019s issue is with this ticket they have to buy to enter the park. I\u2019m not saying OP should pay it. I\u2019m just asking why this is different from other wedding where guests have to pay certain expenses in order to attend."]}
