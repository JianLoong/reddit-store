I say this because of the amount of disdain you clearly have for the biological dad. Sometimes when you're dealing with a parent like that, you feel you have to pick up the slack so the child doesn't feel like they're missing out. Step parents often invest a lot of their time and energy into their partner's kids, as they are extensions of the partner. I read in one of the comments you said she'd always told you you'd be the one to walk her down the aisle. Some people don't realize the weight of their words.", "Yes. A $20000 wedding is very nice, I don\u2019t know what $200000 wedding is?", "Exactly! The father of the bride traditionally pays for the wedding, and she has picked which father she wants to walk her down the aisle, then he can pay for her wedding!", "Yes because similar situations can't happen at all in the world.  It is very rare for children to favor their bio parents over adoptive ones that actually cared for them.  Never happens...", "Bruh, I watched this one on Youtube back in February of 21 when I was recovering from surgery.", "Not $200. \u00a3200. Even worse", "> $20k would have been tops.\n\n30k is actually the average wedding cost in the US as of last year. It was 24k pre-COVID. Places are massively increasing prices.\n\nIn the UK (where I think OP is), it's 19k.", "But they\u2019re not asking about that, are they?", "This should be the top comment.  :)", "Your money to give or not give. But it is not unreasonable whatsoever to walk bride down the aisle if you're coughing up a quarter of a million bucks.\n\nHell for that a fraction of that, I'd make a gold plated statue of you to be put somewhere rather nice. Let alone ONE walk of X feet or meters and hopefully a dad daughter dance.\n\nIf any flying monkeys claims you're the AH, tell them to open their pockets and hand over that kind of cash.\n\nAnything you can't get a good refund on, see if you can donate it to a worthy case. \n\nIf your kid goes ballistic, obviously she loves her biodad who never gave her a cent, so she shouldn't have a problem with you doing the same. I'd leave the door open for things to be fixed down the road, but it's gonna take a while. Take a vacation with some of the saved cash.", "Holy shit.

I mean\u2026. honestly, that\u2019s just immoral. People can\u2019t pay their mortgages and you\u2019re spending \u00a3200k on a party?! \n\nUnless you\u2019re a billionaire and this wedding is costing the same amount of \u00a3 as your charity donations this year, it\u2019s just a bit gross.", "You could literally buy a really nice house for that where I live", "That is an obscene amount of money though.", "So you're not married to her mum ( you keep calling her your fianc\u00e9)\n\nHow long have you been in their lives?", "Is she your wife or fianc\u00e9?

Im sorry again for everything youre going through!", "Sure....but you're blowing the 4x the average annual family income so that a couple of ungrateful 20 somethings can throw a party?

Awful situation to be in.", "I\u2019m trying to work out if it\u2019s a big Indian wedding or a big traveller wedding?", "Think of the difference 75% of the cost of that wedding would make to a charity. They might honour you in some way with a donation like that. It would be meaningful instead of going on something stupid like an ungrateful girl's wedding", "Maybe they are in a country with different exchange rates?", "Dude. We\u2019ve seen this 10000 times already. YTA for not being original. Heavy eye roll", "So she's not your fianc\u00e9e then.", "How long have you been in this girl\u2019s life?", "And they just said they\u2019d \u201cupdate soon\u201d about how much \u201che\u2019s\u201d lost.

She should have had a conversation with you about it and not let it come out like that. \n\nBut also, and maybe it's just a wording thing here, your description of your relationship with her basically boils down to your financial contributions. You didn't speak on how you cared for her, how you guys spent time together, or really any other aspects of a father-daughter relationship. And that's what I was trying to get at by bringing that into my comment. Money doesn't buy love and respect, you know?", "Obviously the father was involved more than he knew.", "the fact she popped out 'my tru father' then what is op to her? and if she's going to humiliate him in front of everyone like that why on earth does she think he's going to bank roll her?", "[removed]", "I\u2018m looking for a husband \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude06", "None of that is OP\u2019s problem. What he does with his money is up to him. No one tells you what to do with yours.  This is about the wedding and if he is an asshole. NTA.", "It's none of your concern what people spend their money on as long as they aren't hurting anyone. Have you ever spent money on a frivolous thing? Well what about starving children who don't know when they'll have their next meal?

Do you want people telling you what you should do with your own money?", "He said that\u2019s pounds.", "it was pounds, so even bigger lol", "Maybe it happens more often than not, which sounds awfully depressing?", "There are strong similarities, but I would not call it exactly the same.", "True", "It appears to be more asking a question.  The original commenter doesn't really give any explanation on why they think OP sucks, just that he does.  Can't reflect on who you are if no one tells you what you have done wrong and why it is wrong.", "Only for the last couple months before his bio daughter got married from the sounds of it", "100%!

I cant believe that girl just ruined things with a step-dad that is willing to spend that much on her - so so silly \ud83d\ude02"]}
