However, it does sound like you're using the money as an excuse to be upset rather than admitting her decision hurt you (as the father figure in her life). I say this because of the amount of disdain you clearly have for the biological dad. Sometimes when you're dealing with a parent like that, you feel you have to pick up the slack so the child doesn't feel like they're missing out. Step parents often invest a lot of their time and energy into their partner's kids, as they are extensions of the partner. I read in one of the comments you said she'd always told you you'd be the one to walk her down the aisle. Some people don't realize the weight of their words. \n\nMy step- sister also did the same thing to my dad. He didn't attend the wedding and didn't say a thing about it after, but ik my dad. He was hurting. He raise her as his own and she chose a man who doesn't even remember her birthday or knows her kids' names.\n\nThen again, I could just be projecting my family's situation onto you.

Reasonable)?\n\nNTA. You stated the truth which is that you're just an ATM for her and she was ungrateful.

You have been an ATM ling enough.", "NTA- You were planning on paying for your true daughters wedding. Easy mistake to make, should thank her for reminding you that you aren't her true father.", "NTA\n\nyour step daughter is, indeed, using you as nothing more than a walking ATM. and from your comments, you feel that's always been the case. I mean...200k for a wedding? seriously? \n\nand for the ultimate slap int he face, even though you paid for everything for her growing up, she wants the man who abandoned her to walk her down the aisle. \n\nas far as the in-laws, fiance, etc....if they can't see what's going on, then nuts to them. you owe no-one anything. if your fiance turns on you over this....well, there's the massive red flag. \n\nno, you're absolutely right on this. don't pay a cent. if you've put deposits down on things, get them back if you can. then, take your money. buy a nice muscle car. I suggest something like a '72 Barracuda or similar muscle car. tricked out. it's your money. enjoy it,", "$200k is too much.\n\nI've heard one like this before.\n\nLooking at this like you are a team with your wife is important in this matter.  I think you can graciously  take your seat at the wedding, this daughter is probably not meaning to hurt or offend you, she's probably fantasizing about the idea of her own father walking her down the aisle and so it's like a fairy tale thing - girls dream of their weddings.\n\n$200k is ridiculous.  \n\n$20k would have been tops.\n\nThe problem is you've already committed it.  Retracting it can cause major drama.\n\nYou should take your daughter in law out to dinner, just you and her, and tell her how this has made you feel and ask her questions.  Talk to her and learn why she chose the other person to walk her down the aisle, and tell her how it makes you feel.  The goal of this conversation would be to make her aware of how she is treating you.", "NTA", "ESH but I do sympathise. Finding out that your role is to just write cheques and keep quiet is pretty crappy.", "First of All, NTA.\n\nYou have yourself a situation on your hands.  Luckily you're not married yet to your fianc\u00e9e.  \nHave you signed any of the contracts for venue, catering, etc.  \nIf so, invoke any cancellation clauses, forfeit any deposits, cancel everything with your name on it.  Yes, you'll lose deposits, but they're sunk costs.  \nOtherwise, make it very clear that you will be paying for \\*nothing\\* and I mean nothing.  No dress for your fianc\u00e9e, no uber rides, not one penny towards this debacle of mooching on your \"step daughter's\" part. Heck, I'd even go so far as to say that you won't be attending the wedding at all now and your \"step daughter\" is an adult and she can go about her business with her bio dad and leave you alone.  \n\n\nTell your fianc\u00e9e that if she doesn't like it, she can take her gold digging self and leave as well.  If you don't have  a pre-nup (Difficult in the UK, but not impossible), go get one ASAP.    \nIf step daughter's soon to be in-laws squawk one iota of anything, you politely tell them they are welcome to foot the bill instead of facilitating their son being a big moocher as well as themselves.  \n\nIf bio dad says anything, politely tell him he can pay for everything.  \n\n\nAt the end of the day you need to set a boundary with your fianc\u00e9e and her family that this isn't open season on your wallet.", "ESH\n\nYour step daughter is exactly what you called her and more.\n\nBut you let yourself be an ATM to her, and her entitlement is the result.

I can't even... $200k for a wedding? Insane.  \nAnd for her to use you, and string you along lying, like that?  Hard NO", "NTA. 200k is ridiculous for a wedding if someone else is paying for it.

For a wedding?! Bruh!\n\nIn all seriousness: you were awfully generous but she didn\u2019t reciprocate in the smaller things like inviting your step siblings and yet you continued to appease her. I understand her yearning to want her biological father (even if he is a deadbeat) but she wasn\u2019t forthcoming with her intentions. Her disrespecting you demonstrated her true feelings about you as your benefactor. Nothing else.", "YOU pay 200k for your step daughter's wedding because you respect her. Then she says she has been in contact withe biological father (a deadbeat asshole who hasn't been in her life and didn't pay child support) and wants that biological father to walk her down the aisle because she considers him her \"REAL\" father, after you feel like you've been clowned after paying for her wedding and for her necessities in general so you say that her \"REAL\" father should pay for her wedding if she loves him so much\nDefinitely NTA", "Wow, so NTA. You were willing to pay $200k (wow!) for her wedding and she literally threw it in your face. Damn and ouch. Get all/any of the money you can back. Spend it on yourself. Awesome car, a rocking year long holiday, whatever. She has been using you as an ATM and that has to hurt, but at least you know how she sees you and you can act and move on accordingly.", "NTA- youre paying for whoke thing lol", "YTA. Reaction sounds disproportionate to the situation at hand. Wanting her actual father to walk her down the isle doesn't necessarily mean that she doesn't also appreciate you. And you called out his inability to cover expenses, child support, etc., but didn't mention anything else about the father's relationship with your step-daughter. \n\nHonestly this whole post makes me feel like you're focused a bit too much on money, and it's keeping you from empathizing with your step daughter who you say has always treated you with respect. \n\nAre you hurt that she didn't ask you to walk? Did you offer? Maybe have a conversation with her. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA for this. But also, kinda yta a little for thinking a $200K wedding was reasonable at all in the first place lol. What a colossal waste of money.", "I'm not married to her and I'm never marrying ever again not after my previous marriage", "I enjoy weddings and wanted to cherish the moment walking my daughter who I thought was mine down the aisle, and the costs was all my daughter and wife planning", "The groom is a very respectable man, he understood my perspective and asked if my decision was final and I said yes.

That sounds like he was willingly uninvolved in his daughter's life", "Like I said im an ATM, but no more", "20% you, 80% her. I dunno.
