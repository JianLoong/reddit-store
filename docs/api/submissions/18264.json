I think it was cool for you to point out that your aunt and uncle might like something.  Your dad may give them something anyway.", "NTA, Honestly I find it endearing that you thought of your aunt and uncle. My husband once suggested to his aunt that she should leave her entire will to a charity she loved in her home town. When she asked why he said that family will always fight over things and contest a will and a charity would put good use to the funds. His other aunt about lost her mind when she found out, me, I was laughing the whole time.\n\nFor my family if my husband passes first I'll play a game. \"What do you think I should do with all I've worked for and created over my life?\" will be the question. The first one that says something about not being fair automatically gets a decrease. Don't be greedy.\n\nIn helping my mom set up her estate and will I steered her being fare to her likening and helped her find clauses that say's if you contest the will to get more you lose every cent she left. I dislike greedy when it comes to death and inheritance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nI'd like to add that yes, unsolicited advice isn't always wanted or needed BUT his GF brought it up to him. There for if the grandfather had enough concern to share the information with his grandson they probably have a good enough relationship to talk about it.\n\nIt sounds more like his father was upset that it was being discussed. I stand by NTA. You where just trying to help your grandpa, man.", "NTA -you only made a suggestion, and an unselfish one at that as it's ultimately your own inheritance you wanted to share with your father's siblings.", "OP the best suggestion is that you should recommend he contact an estate attorney helping sort all of this out.  That way there's someone who is not connected with the family can help him make decisions objectively and there's no emotional issues later on.  It will also help with the transition of any disposal of assets such as the house and any other valuables over a certain dollar amount to hopefully avoid probate in your state.", "YTA. No one likes or appreciate unsolicited advice. Definitely don't tell someone what to do with their money.", "YTA extremely inappropriate.", "YTA. It's your grandpa's decision.", "YTA \n\nHe knows what he has. And has way more understanding of the legalities....how old are you?\n\n\nAnd he probably knows what everyone wants.\n\n\nIf there is something sentimental that your aunt or uncle want, that's left to your dad, your dad can give it to them.", "YTA. He wasn't looking for input. No, his choice is not the one I'd make, but it's his call.", "Yta\n\nThat was wildly inappropriate", "YTA. The only appropriate advice is \"don't worry about leaving us anything. Enjoy your money and spend it on yourself.\"", "NTA\n\nYour grandfather invited the conversation and you were very thoughtful in what you said to him.  \n\nBut there is a lot that you don't know and you said yourself you didn't know how much money your grandpa has.  Your aunt and uncle may get a very sizable monetary inheritance because what you think and what's the truth may be two different things.  Your grandpa may have investments that you have no idea about.\n\nIt sounds like your grandfather wants to ensure that the house and the heirlooms stay in the family to be passed down though your kids.  If your aunt and uncle get some of the things they might disappear at some point ie someone sells them or they give them away to friends or whatever.\n\nBut remember that even if you and your brothers inherit all this from your dad, that you can all do what you want with the house and it's belongings.  Your grandfather will never know because he'll be dead.\n\nAnd your dad may have already talked to his siblings and it's actually all sorted and you saying something might mean that grandfather changes what he does and that worries him.\n\nThere's more going on here and it could lead to animosity.  But even if he did split it all three ways (between his kids) that your aunt and uncle may leave their share to you and your brothers too.\n\nBut you were definitely NTA with what you said to your grandfather.", "YTA- it\u2019s absolutely not your place to critique how he has his will arranged. Its wildly inappropriate. \n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much money exactly my grandpa has\u201d- exactly you don\u2019t know, you\u2019re talking about things you have NO idea about and it\u2019s extremely rude", "When you have worked your whole life to leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren, you can decide how it is split up.
