It ruins your entire day, and it stacks up. The longer you're sleep-deprived the worse it is on your body and mind.

Your father is asking you to leave, because you are demanding and entitled, and he's sick of it. Grow up and stop expecting your father to support you and everyone else to cater to you.

Which you should have offerd since you're a grown-up but you seem to be lacking in the common sense department so you find it odd.\n\nPaying rent for a room does not make you a tenant but a boarder. Also it does not give you permission to move in animals and another person. That's just rude and I pity your dad.

How... how do you think you're not? You're 24 years old and somehow still expect your parents to take care of you? So you 'generously' paid him rent after he asked, like that's such a big ask. Then you move your girlfriend in, which, let's be real here buddy, is not something that he should have to explicitly tell you NOT to do. You should, as a grown ass man, know this. If you were living with roommates, it'd be a dick move to move your gf in. Your gf who apparently came with pets. Birds, no less. \n\nI have a feeling the pathological liar here is you. You're also heavily in denial if you can write all of this out and not see how you're the problem here. 30 days is all he's legally required to give you, since you're paying rent and that makes you a tenant. Your gf is an unwanted longterm guest who you've tried to slide in under your tenancy. You suck in every form imaginable. What exactly is 'properly served'? All he has to do is tell you. If you want him to file an actual eviction, you might want to rethink that. Seems like you've never rented before, and if the first place you've technically paid rent at is your parents and they evict you, that's going on your record. All foreseeable landlords are going to know that. Is it worth it?\n\n30 days is all he's legally required to give you. You didn't sign a lease, so you're on a month to month tenancy. Your gf has zero relevance to this scenario, so stop bringing her up as a shield and excuse. Go get a lawyer. Your dad can evict you for any reason. He LIVES IN THE HOME. That makes it a completely different thing than you think it does. He doesn't need a reason, genius. You don't have a signed lease, you're month to month, and all he has to say is \"I don't want to share my home anymore.\" Ding. You're out. That's all the reason he needs. He allowed you to stay there for what I'm assuming is a minimal rent. Not you, your gf who eats his shit and probably doesn't contribute, and her birds. You're putting his living condition at risk with your behavior, but I don't expect you to care because you sound incredibly narcissistic.", "YTA I recently had a similar situation.

And second off, what you got was a 30 day notice to quit. 30 days is the minimum amount of time he is allowed to give you, unless it\u2019s for something super serious like illegal drugs or a very serious health hazard (24 hours on those cases.) If you do not leave by that 30th day, dad can legally serve you an eviction notice.", "You\u2019re an entitled asshole get out of your dads house", "YTA. You're an ADULT. You're perfectly capable of growing up and taking care of yourself. You should have been paying rent immediately. Being his child doesn't entitle you to live in his home for free. Nothing he said enforces your pathological liar statement,  I wouldn't be surprised if you don't even know what a pathological liar is. Also you saying these complaints are \"clearly not true\"- how? What's clearly pointing to any lies? Your dad was kind enough to let you move in, you took advantage of him, didn't respect him even though you claim you have tons of respect for him and then you move a girl and animals into his home, smoke inside and disrupt his safe space. What is wrong with you? Also, if he served you a 30 day notice, a lawyer is going to laugh you right out the door. Smoking inside alone is enough to have you evicted, as 99% of apartments don't allow smoking, let alone smoking Marijuana. Pets? Don't even get me started. You realize your dad signed a lease, right? Which comes with a huge list of rules. Not recommendations, rules. Pets usually lead to a fee, either paid upfront or paid monthly added to rent prices. Did you even stop and consider the fact that his bills would have gone up significantly? He's now paying for THREE people to live in his home where prior to you invading, he paid for ONE person to live there. You're putting him at risk of losing his home and you're so self absorbed yoi don't even see it. You know exactly why your mom kicked you out. And reading your post, we all have a pretty good idea as to what those reasons were. Just because YOU don't understand something doesn't mean it's invalid. And finally,  back to the eviction- 30 days is the typical amount of time on a standard eviction, if everyone else can figure it out, so can you. You are not some special exception to adulthood. You played a game of FAFO and now you're crying because you found out you had to grow up. Your dad owes you NOTHING. His obligations to feed and shelter you are long past expired.
