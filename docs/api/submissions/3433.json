When we got to the green we were fortunate enough to find an empty bench for Emma to be able to rest on which was great because if we sat on the ground it would have been more difficult for her to get up on her own. \nThe way the benches are set up is that they were in pairs, one right next to each other. They also have no arm rests or backs.\nWe had been sitting there for a few minutes when a kid (I\u2019m guess was around the same age as my kids) started jumping from the one we weren\u2019t sitting on to the one we were sitting on knocking into my daughter. This happened a few times. I was staring at the parent hoping they would say something as I was getting increasingly annoyed. Not that any kid should deal with that but my daughters balance isn\u2019t the greatest so it just annoyed me a lot. \nI decided to say something to the mom asking her to tell her kid not to do that. She ran over and yelled at me telling me her kid was autistic and I needed to be I needed to be understanding. Jacob has ASD so I said so and that I don\u2019t understand what that had to do with asking her kid to not hurt mine. She continued to yell at me saying I wasn\u2019t being understanding and that he wanted to play so she wasn\u2019t going to stop him. \nAt that point since she pulled out the excuse of her child having additional needs as an excuse for this being ok I said \u2018well just know when your kid jumps into mine he\u2019s hurting someone with cerebral palsy.\u201d The mom then grabbed her kid and said I was a bitch and told her kid he couldn\u2019t play bc of me.\nI told my friend this and they said I was the AH for how I handled it and that we should have just moved to avoid an issue and causing a scene. Now that I\u2019m thinking about it I\u2019m wondering am I the AH for continuing to engage with this person and mentioning that my kids had ASD and cerebral palsy? \n\nAlso i\u2019m posting from my phone so if the post doesn\u2019t look right that\u2019s why", "created_utc": 1669642876, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6wvzc/aita_for_asking_a_mom_to_tell_her_kid_to_stop/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm willing to excuse the child, what with being a child and having ASD but this \"autism mom\" does not get a free pass because *she* is an adult who knows better.\n\nAs an adult with ADHD myself, while it is very important to give grace to children with disabilities, that grace doesn't mean they just get to be flat out feral regardless of the consequences to anyone else around them. This mom is just mad because she lost her \"trump card.\"", "NTA. Her child wanting to play, ASD or not, doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to do something that would hurt someone else.", "NTA.

YOU did not cause the scene. YOU were protecting your daughter!!!! The other child could play just not by jumping into your daughter!!!!", "NTA, some people are getting a bit ridiculous in regards \"understanding\"\n\nUnderstanding doesn't mean put up with bad behaviours.", "No child has the right to hurt someone else, not because of: ADHD, ASD or whatever. I say this as an adult with ADHD and ASD who has spent her entire life adjusting to others. Yes, that sucks, but it's part of life. You did not scold the child, you kindly made a request to the mother. NTA", "Nta....and this is why i teach my niece to be mindful of others when she's playing.", "NTA. She\u2019s selfish and irresponsible and raising her kid to be too.", "NTA that kid and the other mom is problematic.", "NTA - ASD is not an excuse to throw out because that parent refuses to be a responsible parent. She should be trying to teach him how to share communal spaces. You and your kids were sitting there first so Emma could get a break, and they don't just get to pop up and physically assault people just because kid needs to get some energy out. \n\nAlso, the only reason she threw that line in there of \"you can't play\" is because she is used to bullying people with that line. Her son's ASD is a tool for her to use to control situations instead of saying \"hey Tim. Other people are using the other bench, so we can't play on that one, okay?\"", "NTA. The mom should've been making sure her kid wasn't disturbing anyone, and I think its very reasonable you asked her if she could get him to stop, especially if you weren't rude about it.", "NTA the other woman was the AH. Her child's special needs, whichever they might be, don't excuse her from having to parent them. Just like your children's special needs don't excuse you from parenting them either. \n\nShe sounds like the type of lazy parent that holds onto their child's diagnosis as a free pass card to get away with crap in public. Only this time she encountered someone with a \"stronger\" (in her mind, I hope that's clear) disability card to play, and she got pissed she couldn't get away with it like usual. \n\nYour friend must be one of those people who avoid confrontation and end up believing that anyone who confronts bad behavior is automatically an AH, but that's far from the case. You were there first, your child was using the bench the way it's meant to be used (for sitting down, not for jumping from one to the other or whatever), and you only asked the other woman to make sure her child didn't hurt yours, you never demanded them to leave or anything out of line. Why on earth would you and your children, who arrived on the bench first, should have just moved away? Hell no.", "I'm not questioning the legitimacy of the other kids condition, however I do a see an increasing amount of parents declaring their kids have something like autism just so they can do as they like, my family adopted 2 kids with disabilities and my mum never throws it around as an excuse, she treats the children as she would any other child but will apologise and explain the the other parent if they cause any type of issue", "NTA - Kids with autism can understand \"don't knock into people\" when reminded. At the very least the childs mother could have told her kid to play elsewhere since it would have been difficult for your daughter to move to avoid the issue. Your comments could have been more tactful but the sentiment was fine.", "NTA.. If she was so concerned about her child, she'd have been watching him.

She was either looking for a fight, or she would say her son wanted to play with your daughter. Me, I would have moved to the spot the kid was jumping on, and if he jumped on me, that's when I would have said something, and probably had told the mother that I would be happy to have the police down there for assault, if she didn't learn how to parent. But likely the kid would find somewhere else to play.", "NTA. When mom chose not to do something, I would have spoken to the jumping kid directly. Let him know calmly that he was hurting another kid by jumping in to her. Kids with ASD (as you probably know) may miss social cues that they're hurting another kid, but they usually understand when you explain it to them using clear language, which is what his mom should have done. Your only other option is to physically occupy the space he is jumping in to, to stop him from being able to do it, which is super passive-agressive but effective. The other mom handled it very poorly. Made all the wrong choices and took out her frustrations on you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
