IMO, if you attend the wedding as a guest it\u2019s appropriate to contribute a gift that\u2019s at least equal the value of what it cost the newlyweds for you to be there. $50 sounds like more than a reasonable contribution for someone as far removed from you as your boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s friend. If your BF wants to do more because he\u2019s closer to this person, that\u2019s on him.\n\nEdit: apologies for the poor explanation.

It isn't your SIL's wedding, so I think that 50dollars is reasonable to pay for people you don't know.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like your bf is a cheapskate. He wants you to fund half of a gift to a person you've never met? What if he had decided to give say, $1000? And then demanded you pony up $500? \n\nThis is at least a yellow flag.

But I also think the fact that he wants to bring you to a wedding like that and willing to introduce you to everyone, shows to what degree he sees of you in his future.\n\nUltimately, it is up to you.", "Tell him thanks, but I don't think I want to come anymore.", "Yep ^^", "The notion that the hosts should recoup the cost of the party via the guests is ridiculous. It's their choice how much to spend. A guest is under no obligation to give any gift, much less one of a minimum value. A guest gives what they want.", "I have NEVER brought a gift as a plus one. The person invited always handled it.", "I mean, if that works for you, then great. I've even known invited people who does not prepare a gift. It's not obligatory by any means, hence, the word should as in it would be nice to, but not must.\n\nBut personally, I always try to bring a gift of some sort, even if it's something as simple as writing a card. It's the least I can do as most weddings are very expensive, and I'm going there to spend their money. In fact, I am someone who don't even go to another person's house for a meal without bringing a gift of some sort. It's just a moral standard I put myself up to.

I wouldn't give him anything", "You are the plus one and I don't think he should ask you to contribute as his date who doesn't even know them, so NTA.

I hope you don't have to pay for the cab/uber or a hotel or anything like that unless you intend to leave separately.", "NTA. In general I think is rude to go to a party/wedding without bringing a gift but you did offer to put in $50. These people are total strangers and they're not exactly family to your boyfriend.

I would have offered ZERO.", "Sister\u2019s best friend? You don\u2019t owe strangers a gift. Especially him deciding the amount. You\u2019re NTA but he is.", "NTA. I would have given 25 hahaha.

Separate accounts as we blended but we do have a joint for shared bills and family trips. 5 yrs, not a single fight over money. \n\nWedding from his side comes out of his account. Wedding from mine comes out of mine. And we typically will buy the others clothes. So last Wedding was a year ago on his side, he bought me a gorgeous backless dress as I had lost a bunch of weight and he wanted to take me shopping. He hired and accommadated the sitter, and his account paid for the couples cash gift. \n\n18 months ago it was my best friends wedding. I got him a nice new dress shirt to match me l, I took care of finding and paying for the sitter and I paid for the gift. \n\nCould we just agree to do this all out of joint account... sure. But it feels way more romantic and special when we do it our way. I'd adapt to my husband wanting to go to 50/50 on wedding but it'd feel like taking the dating out of our marriage which I wouldn't love.

So weird that your BF requested you to split the gift even though you didn't even know the bride/groom. He should be considerate and rational about this.", "**NTA**\n\n25 and still living at home. \n\nI wonder if he\u2019s doing 50/50 on bills there?", "You're his plus one. He can handle the gift alone. He doesn't sound mature.", "NTA, I've never expected my plus 1 to contribute and I've never been expected to contribute as a plus 1.

He's the guest, you're the plus one. It was nice of you to offer to contribute at all, but as he is the invited guest, the gift is his responsibility. Were you both invited, that could be a different story depending on your familiarity with the couple. My boyfriend and I have both been listed on invitations to weddings for several of my friends, because my friends knew he would be my plus 1 and probably wanted to make it clear I was able to bring him. I never asked him to contribute to a gift, aside from signing the card I bought. It was kind of an unspoken thing. These are my friends, so it's my responsibility.", "This is weird. Why is it so important to him that you pay?? You were generous by offering $50. I'd have been like \"alright, have fun, drink water, text me when you want me to pick you up.\"\n\nFor context, I understand it to be customary for the invitee to handle the gift. It only makes sense to split if you both are invited guests with your own social ties to one or both of the newlyweds. At least, that's how my partner and I have always done it. Additionally, we gift more when we bring the other as a plus one, because that's twice as much food & drink the hosts are providing. So basically, bringing my man as a date costs me ~$100 more per wedding (worth it). Him being so cheap and stuck on this - which should be a non-issue! - would be a concern to me and, frankly, a little insulting. I'd be embarrassed and a little hurt that my partner wouldn't want to pay his gift on his own/gift a little extra for me to attend (assuming good financial standing). Your company at this celebration isn't worth $75 to him? Ouch.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\n+1s shouldn\u2019t be contributing towards a gift. They are a guest of the invited person, who is the one responsible for a gift. If you don\u2019t know the couple well enough to be invited by name you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to contribute. You\u2019re not there for them - you\u2019re there to keep the person who invited you company.", "Don't give him anything to add to the gift. He is the invitee.", "The inviter needs to take care of the gift. If he can't afford 150 then he can give less.", "NTA and you should contribute 0.
