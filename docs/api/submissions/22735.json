The plus one doesn\u2019t pay for the gift.", "NTA - Do not go.", "NTA.", "You should tell him to have a good time at the wedding, but you won\u2019t be attending.\n\nIn no universe is it appropriate for your BF to ask you to subsidize a gift to someone who\u2019s a complete stranger to you. And it\u2019s even more inappropriate for him to double down after being told no.\n\nYou sure you want to continue this relationship?\n\nNTA", "NTA - Youre his guest, he needs to contribute the gift.", "Side note I\u2019d pay attention. He is getting mad because you aren\u2019t funding what HE WANTS. He\u2019s getting mad because you aren\u2019t agreeing to do something to make him look good. This is a flag for you to look at. Is this a theme? Does he do stuff like this regularly? You need to pay half for him or for you two to do something you don\u2019t want to do but he does?", "NTA - any time I've been a plus one for a wedding, the other person is in charge of the gift since it's their friend/family member. If I'm bringing a plus one, I'm in charge of the gift. I went to a wedding two weeks ago with my husband for one of my friends. He's met them and likes them. I still did the gift out of my budget because they're my friend.\n\nIf it was someone we both knew more equally then yeah, we'd split it.", "NTA, you\u2019re the plus one", "NTA.  Don't go.  Your BF is being a cheapskate trying to get you to pay for half of HIS gift.  Why would you give a gift to someone you don't know?  You weren't invited, he was.  What would he do if this was the other way around?", "NTA \n\nI would tell him you would love to be his date, but he is responsible for the gift himself, if that is a problem you prefer to stay home and watch Netflix and drink wine", "NTA your counter is very fair.", "LOL.\nNTA. This is his side\u2019s wedding. You are merely a guest. He\u2019s cheap.", "Tell him \"Thanks, but no thanks, I'll get my own gift.\" Easy peasy. NTA", "NTA- has he ever bought presents for your friends whose birthdays he's attended?\n\nThere's a stage where partners begin bringing like their significant others important people gifts.\n\nIf you've reached that stage like say if he's given your mother or sibling a gift or something like that then yeah I can see it.\nBut if you are not there yet then this is not the place to start.\n\nLike being invited to his sister's birthday dinner would bring a card and some sort of gift or something like that.\n\nUntil then, unless money is totally not an issue, It's the person who's connection is the gift responsibility.\n\nI went in on a couple of the early couple gifts with my partner when we started dating.\n\nAny thank yous were just to him and not me.  Kind of made me salty. But anyway.", "NTA. You're the plus one. He should contribute it all.", "100% NTA. \nYou are the plus one. In my experience, the person invited gets the gift, hotel, etc. you are just the +1 attending a wedding of someone you don\u2019t know?

He\u2019d have to provide it whether you attended or not.\n\nYour offer to contribute was very nice.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend wants to use you as an ATM.", "NTA\n\n$50 is being generous on your part. I would do that or nothing. If he makes a big deal out of it, don't go to the wedding.", "NTA and he is already showing you he is cheap. Take that as the truth and make some hard decisions for yourself.", "NTA, he\u2019s technically the guest and you are the plus one anyways so it\u2019s on him to handle the gift, but you\u2019re willing to contribute $50 which is fine.", "nta, you should pay 0 it's not your person's wedding. offer to just not go", "Deciding how much to spend on a wedding gift can be tricky. Consider factors like your relationship with the couple, your budget, and whether they have a registry. Using the registry or cash fund as a guide is recommended, but you can also give a more personal or creative gift if you prefer. The decision is up to you and your boyfriend, so communicate your feelings and find a compromise that suits both of you. Remember, gifts are about warm wishes, not obligations.", "No way I\u2019m contributing 50/50 for a wedding gift for someone I don\u2019t know.

You don\u2019t know this person. You are a guest\u2019s guest.", "NTA.  You don't have the money.

I wouldn't contribute anything.   You don't know these people and you're going as a plus one.", "You're NTA, it's ridiculous that he's asking you to contribute money towards a gift for someone you've never met, you're simply his guest", "NTA. If you're just a plus one to a wedding where you've never met the bride or groom you're not obligated to contribute to a gift at all imo.\n\nOne of my close friends that my boyfriend has spent ample time with is getting married in a month and we were invited as a couple, so I expect him to split a gift with me.

He's made an unreasonable and unfair request. You refused but have offered a compromise, taking your extenuating circumstances into account. He's refused to consider that, and not only, is upset that you would suggest it.\n\nKeep your eye on this one OP. He's showing you who he is.\n\nNTA", "Were you specifically invited, or are you his plus one? \n\nYou are NTA either way because you offered to contribute quite generously imo. If you are his plus 1 you are not expected to bring any gift at all, though you can if you want.", "NTA if it's a wedding I'm invited to I pay the gift etc. My partner and I live together so now I'll put his name on the gift as well but I previously don't even add the name of my plus one. We still keep our finances fairly separate so I don't really expect him to chip in on it", "NTA. IMO, if you attend the wedding as a guest it\u2019s appropriate to contribute a gift that\u2019s at least equal the value of what it cost the newlyweds for you to be there. $50 sounds like more than a reasonable contribution for someone as far removed from you as your boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s friend. If your BF wants to do more because he\u2019s closer to this person, that\u2019s on him.", "NTA . It isn't your SIL's wedding, so I think that 50dollars is reasonable to pay for people you don't know.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like your bf is a cheapskate. He wants you to fund half of a gift to a person you've never met? What if he had decided to give say, $1000? And then demanded you pony up $500? \n\nThis is at least a yellow flag. You've only been with him for 11 months.", "I think if you're going to the wedding, you should bring a gift even if you don't know the person, and if you two cannot come to an agreement on something, just prepare 2 separate gifts.\n\nThat being said, like you said, you don't even know the person, so technically speaking, you don't have to go to the wedding. But I also think the fact that he wants to bring you to a wedding like that and willing to introduce you to everyone, shows to what degree he sees of you in his future.\n\nUltimately, it is up to you.", "Tell him thanks, but I don't think I want to come anymore.", "Yep ^^", "The notion that the hosts should recoup the cost of the party via the guests is ridiculous. It's their choice how much to spend. A guest is under no obligation to give any gift, much less one of a minimum value. A guest gives what they want.", "I have NEVER brought a gift as a plus one. The person invited always handled it.", "I mean, if that works for you, then great. I've even known invited people who does not prepare a gift. It's not obligatory by any means, hence, the word should as in it would be nice to, but not must.\n\nBut personally, I always try to bring a gift of some sort, even if it's something as simple as writing a card. It's the least I can do as most weddings are very expensive, and I'm going there to spend their money. In fact, I am someone who don't even go to another person's house for a meal without bringing a gift of some sort. It's just a moral standard I put myself up to. But obviously, it is still a personal choice."]}
