IMO, if you attend the wedding as a guest it\u2019s appropriate to contribute a gift that\u2019s at least equal the value of what it cost the newlyweds for you to be there. $50 sounds like more than a reasonable contribution for someone as far removed from you as your boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s friend. If your BF wants to do more because he\u2019s closer to this person, that\u2019s on him.\n\nEdit: apologies for the poor explanation.

But I also think the fact that he wants to bring you to a wedding like that and willing to introduce you to everyone, shows to what degree he sees of you in his future.\n\nUltimately, it is up to you.", "Tell him thanks, but I don't think I want to come anymore.", "Yep ^^", "The notion that the hosts should recoup the cost of the party via the guests is ridiculous. It's their choice how much to spend. A guest is under no obligation to give any gift, much less one of a minimum value. A guest gives what they want.", "I have NEVER brought a gift as a plus one. The person invited always handled it.", "I mean, if that works for you, then great. I've even known invited people who does not prepare a gift. It's not obligatory by any means, hence, the word should as in it would be nice to, but not must.\n\nBut personally, I always try to bring a gift of some sort, even if it's something as simple as writing a card. It's the least I can do as most weddings are very expensive, and I'm going there to spend their money. In fact, I am someone who don't even go to another person's house for a meal without bringing a gift of some sort. It's just a moral standard I put myself up to.

I hope you don't have to pay for the cab/uber or a hotel or anything like that unless you intend to leave separately.", "NTA. In general I think is rude to go to a party/wedding without bringing a gift but you did offer to put in $50. These people are total strangers and they're not exactly family to your boyfriend.

Separate accounts as we blended but we do have a joint for shared bills and family trips. 5 yrs, not a single fight over money. \n\nWedding from his side comes out of his account. Wedding from mine comes out of mine. And we typically will buy the others clothes. So last Wedding was a year ago on his side, he bought me a gorgeous backless dress as I had lost a bunch of weight and he wanted to take me shopping. He hired and accommadated the sitter, and his account paid for the couples cash gift. \n\n18 months ago it was my best friends wedding. I got him a nice new dress shirt to match me l, I took care of finding and paying for the sitter and I paid for the gift. \n\nCould we just agree to do this all out of joint account... sure. But it feels way more romantic and special when we do it our way. I'd adapt to my husband wanting to go to 50/50 on wedding but it'd feel like taking the dating out of our marriage which I wouldn't love.

He can handle the gift alone. He doesn't sound mature.", "NTA, I've never expected my plus 1 to contribute and I've never been expected to contribute as a plus 1.

You understand the value of her company (because you have chosen well).", "My dude, I've been in college the past ten years. Actually, college and *high school*. I've barely had $150 to scrape together, much less give away. \n\nEven now, I'm 27, a year out of grad school, attended a wedding this year and the brides literally told me not to buy a gift because I'm not fully employed yet. \n\nMaybe you just hang out with a lot of rich people or something, but in the crowds I run in, $150 for a wedding is really generous. $50 is a lot more the norm.", "It\u2019s not the 50\u00b4s anymore. Man doesn\u2019t need, shouldn\u2019t pay for his partner. When you get kids , there is a reevaluation. Until then pay your share. \n\nFor the subject. He is the guest, he should pay the gift.

What they spent was their choice. I'm going to give the gift I'm financially able to.", "You are not tasteless and that's not the point at all. It is a kind gesture of guests for the gift to cover the plate cost of the meal at the venue. It's a rule of thumb to go by if you are able, not a requirement and certainly not an etiquette rule. Guests should be valued people, there to celebrate with you and everyone's circumstances is different.\n\nClose family often give gifts many times that guide, and a young person or someone who doesn't know the couple well may gift something smaller. Hosts provide for guests meals, snacks and drinks that they are able or want to provide, and guests give gifts as they are able. An invitation is never an obligation, neither as a summons or a gift demand.", "Lmfaooooo.", "Is it better or worse than being scammed by and losing money to a bot account?

Everyone was Russian except for me and one other American couple. All the Russians gave the host a gift of cash to cover their share of the party costs. The American couple gave a nice but inexpensive gift.\n\nAfterwards my young friend complained heavily about how cheap and rude this couple was for giving a cheap gift for two people. I was honest with him about how tacky I thought his expectation was.\n\nNo right and wrong really ... just different cultural expectations regarding hosting and gifting."]}
