The practice was notorious for keeping you waiting way beyond what was acceptable.  \nOn this particular occasion, I entered my dentist's waiting room and noticed a shiny new poster over the mantlepiece with a list of fines that would be imposed upon patients according to how late they were attending their appointment - the later you were, the higher the fine.  Not a problem for me as I am.always early for my appointments.  \nI sat and waited and half an hour after my scheduled appointment, I went to reception to ask how much longer I would have to wait?  Not long now, I was told with no apology.  I returned to the waiting room and waited a further half an hour.  At this point I was becoming rather angry as had business elsewhere and was now likely to be late.  At forty minutes (one hour and ten minutes total past my appointment time), I returned to reception and let them.know that I could not wait any longer to keep my appointment and, in view of the new notice about fines for lateness, I expect a similar amount to be deducted from my bill when I did eventually see the dentist.  They were visibly shocked and apologetic but I could wait no longer and left.\nI eventually saw my dentist a few weeks later.   His first words to me were an apology for the previous visit.  I told him I still expected a discount on the bill in view of the new notice in the waiting room.  He laughed but saw that I was serious. He had the good grace to only charge me half the usual check-up fee.\nI can't say it was related but the next time I went, the notice had disappeared and shortly after that, he set up a new practice with a colleague completely separate from the old practice.

Generally at this clinic, they tended not to run any more than about 30 mins late.  Sometimes they were even on time!  This wasn't my usual GP but I'd seen a few GP's there and the wait times were similar for all of them.\n\nSo one day I had an after noon shift and booked a time to see the GP that would've given me 45 mins leeway of wait time (and then + the appointment time) and still get to work on time.  Anyhow, 40 mins past the time, I started to get antsy, 45 mins past the appointment, more antsy.  About 50 mins past the appointment time I got really antsy and thought that if I don't get called in within the next 5 mins then I actually don't have time for my appointment.  Well 5 mins later... still didn't get called up.  So I went to the desk and said I've been waiting almost an hour, I now have to go because I don't have time for the appointment and I have to get to work (I was in uniform).  The receptionist said it was fine.  Then a couple of weeks later I get a letter in the mail... because you were a no show to your appointment, this was your one chance and next time we'll take you off our patient list.  WTH... I was in you fricking waiting room for almost an hour... I should've billed you for MY time.  I think I did ring them and reminded them and when I saw my usual doctor, she wasn't impressed either and said it was an admin thing and they have no idea.  I think she took the 'no show' off my file.\n\nThere are some occupations where you are guaranteed a wait and a general doctor is one of them.  Specialists tend to be a lot better and they don't run anywhere near as late (but still can) as these often only do clinics and are there rather than on call for emergencies and doing two jobs on the one day (an exception is an OB).  But psychologists tend to be on time, physios etc.  I get why doctors run late ie patient brings in the family instead of just the one appointment they made for themselves and just wants the doctor to run over the kids... Many doctors might do one and then tell the patient they need to make an appt for each kid or book a longer time.  And emergencies happen... and things that may have looked easy are actually more complicated ie patient comes in for a repeat prescription but on talking to them the GP realises that their mental health is suffering because something has happened between this appt and the last and next thing they know they are doing a mental health screen and referring them for more help... when it was meant to be a quick repeat prescription for their anti cholesterol drugs.", "Nta", "nta", "NTA. in the past 35 years, only once have I had to wait more than 5-10 minutes for a doctor or dentist. The one time I did, I was about 24 years old taking my toddler for a check up and they misplaced his file so I didn\u2019t get called back until at 30 minutes I checked with reception to see what the hold up was. My pediatrician told me to never wait more than 5 minutes, they don\u2019t allow overbooking.

That even less if talking about a mobility impaired person, or an older fellow that will take more time getting dressed/undressed (and that's undertandable and fine!)\n\nI was \"lucky\" to have a trained nurse along me to help me doing it...or having a residence workmate helping a few times.\n\nPublic system is no better. In both public and private you have a boss (the state or the insurance company/the owner of the clinic) that WILL overwork you as much as they can.\n\n\nHowever I don't see the point in still asking money for a thing that hasn't been done because of private overbooking (and I work privately now). OP should go up to the clinic and complain about the dentist only having 10 minutes for the consult and having to rush patients.", "What country is that? German here and especially psychologists seem to get shafted harder by our governmental health care than I would have thought possible.", "Totally agree.  Fact office has 6 exam rooms, schedule 6 patients every 15 minutes, single Dr can\u2019t do it all, but will bill line mad.  NTA", "Nope. I'm a soon to be graduating medical student and I've learned the tough fact that doctors don't get to choose. Their corporations require them to perform a certain amount of RVU's a quarter, meaning they have to see a certain amount of patients. If they fail to meet the required RVU amount then they could get fired.", "They have nothing to do with scheduling", "Let me guess - when you're in a restaurant, you blame the server and give them a crap tip when it takes longer than expected for your food to come out.", "It's absolutely the case in Australia, they never run on time", "of course they do, they choose how many patients they will see in a day.\n\nif they need 20 minute per paitent they can choose to only schedule as many as they can see eith that in mind.", "Maybe in a private practice. \n\nMost practices are groups now. The office manager chooses how many patients doctors sees a day based off information from insurance.  \n\nTrust me my general practice doctor wishes he could see less patients a day. He combats it by taking the time patients need. He's worth the wait. I combat it back by only booking the first appointment of the day. I easily make at least 3 people late for their appointments because we take our time. \n\nHe often stays way later than scheduled as well to make sure the patients get their time \n\nTheir hands are tied.", "And these practice groups purchase the doctors at a slave market is Tulsa?\n \nOr did they freely enter into this agreement willingly as free men?\n \nYou know who else willingly decided to join an enterprise that screws people? Pirates. Did we let them off scott free for willingly joining the whims of the ~~office manager~~ ships captain? Nope, hanged by the neck until dead.", "Well pirates didn\u2019t treat people for medical issues as a part of their job, did they? If we hang the doctors that work in high volume locations where this is more of an issue, all that does is make less doctors food the same number of patients who need to be seen, so you\u2019re either waiting months (and likely over a year) for an appointment or you\u2019re shit outta luck and can\u2019t get one. You want more doctors going to those high volume locations so that the amount of time you wait goes down, not up.", "It's incredibly difficult to start a private practice now and compete. I've had doc friends look into this because of this exact issue. They hate seeing that many patients per day. But they don't have a choice if they can't start their own practice", "The 1717 Act of Grace signed by George I gave them amnesty, provided they surrendered before the deadline.", "The ship\u2019s surgeon and the surgeon\u2019s mate did, just fyi."]}
