They always end the photo book with a message that is supposed to be nice but always refers to their life. For instance, one of our friends was a new dad and they put a lot of picture of themselves with his baby, but not a single one of the mother. The message was \u201clooking forward to have one of our own so they can play together!\u201d\n\nEvery time, they pressure the birthday person to review the book in front of everyone.

I obviously got my own book. Despite me trying to put it aside by saying I would take time to enjoy it privately, they pushed me to look at it.

She then replied \u201cbut the gift was for you, not for him\u201d. I said the wedding was about the both of us. She says it\u2019s not about the wedding. I honestly don\u2019t know how to explain something that obvious, so I just told her to forget about it, that it\u2019s no big deal, disagreements happen. But they won\u2019t let go.

She did put a lot of thought into *excluding everyone else from each others books*.

If your wedding day was such a great memory for you, it was because - stick with me, here comes the twist - *you probably quite like your husband*.  Like, he didn't crash a spontaneous happy memory with you and this spooky couple - he was the cause of the memorable event. Either way, pictures of him presumably don't make you dry wretch. So why cut him out?\n\nThe thing is, discussing this with them further is pointless. Because arguments serve a different function for different people. Some want a resolution or understanding, some people just want tell their version of events, some people *know* they were in the wrong but, because they can't *admit* to being wrong, they use the back and forth to sort of build up a counter-case and stick to it, rigidly, no matter what. \n\nYour friends know they were being weird - any chance that they *didn't* know cropping the groom out of his wedding photo could be viewed in a negative light went out the window when your husband made a (very witty, rather forbearing) comment about the pic , and Jill went for him.

The fact is, their cutting your husband out if the photo made you two feel the way it made you feel. That they couldn't predict that you might be upset / offended shows they didn't put a lot of thought into it, and the thought they did put into it wasn't of your feelings.

It wasn't much of a gift, it showed little thought about you (or your husband!) and you were right to  be rather unimpressed about it.  NTA.  \n\nOh.  And now they're sulking because of your reaction to the gift.  Well... at least one good thing came out of this!", "NTA. Someone needed to call them out for this self-centered and frankly bizarre behavior.", "NTA but I do recommend evaluating if these friends should still be friends.", "NTA\n\nThey are bizarrely self-centered and don't sound like actual friends at all because everything in their lives revolve around them. Us, us, us, see how everything is about us?\n\nI'm petty enough that at their next big event, I'd regift it back to them and tell them I think they'd appreciate it more than I do.", "NTA. With friends like them, who needs enemies?", "I have a horrible relationship with my mum. About 8 years ago she gifted me this frankly amazing photo book. There were photos of me I had never seen, with people I had no idea had ever been photographed as it spanned from the mid 2015 to the 1940s.\n\nI was blown away. It was about 40 pages. Some tiny photos. It must have taken hours. I was genuinely quite overcome and choked up and then she said \u2018well, you needed a book to remind you who the most important person in your life is. Me. Your mother. You can look at it and remember that forever.\u2019\n\nAnd that was the last time I saw her. Admittedly things did escalate a bit when on the same trip back in my home country with limited holiday flights she tried to stab me but it was the photo book that sent me no contact.\n\nI cannot look at that book now without seeing every moment of hell it was having her in my life. But it may be my most treasured item because it freed me and one day I might be able to revisit it.\n\nMy parents *loved* family photos. If you take endless photos of your family moments and frame them, no one ever realises you torture your kids the rest of the time. They were more like alibis than mementoes. I genuinely look like I have been taken hostage in most of them too. Like a tiny toddler goth of ennui.\n\nMy mum is exactly the kind of person who would weaponise a photo book like this and is kicking herself she has no friends, husband or kids to feature herself via.\n\nNTA. This group was way too tolerant for too long.", "Omg that would mean they should have gifted me a book... Full of pictures of myself? \ud83d\ude31 THAT is a gift from hell!", "Taking the guilty plea. Feel free to eject me!", "What is the tone deaf christmas letter? Didn't know that one!", "It wasn't always like that. When we were younger and they were not dating, they were not like that. But since they got together, and maybe because I'm getting older, is getting worse or I have less patience. So you stay friends because you remember the good times, and there are still good moments, and you don't really need to cut them off because you're just not close anymore, and other people still like them and they are part of the group yada yada. Most of the time I don't pay attention to their behavior, and honestly, even this is not worth cutting someone off and wanting to exclude them from a whole group.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "> exclude other important people\n\nNow you know who they see as important.", "Especially for your god damn wedding as well. It\u2019s one thing to just not include any pictures that your husband was in, but to explicitly resize it and cut him out is a major asshole move", "The only effort they put in", "The problem is I feel like their intent is to do what they want without having people be mad at them. So while they intended to not have people be mad at them, they didn't intend on doing anything to prevent people from being mad at them.", "If everyone misinterprets their intent, maybe the problem is them?", "I love this!", "Ugh, this.\n\nConsidered posting the other day about something similar. My BIL and his girlfriend are like this. They have a 3 year old son and they will gift you a picture of him on YOUR birthday. Like every time. With some stupid \"our kid makes everyone's life better\" kind of attitude.\n\nEven his own father rolled his eyes this past Christmas when he pulled out yet another daycare photo he has saved on his phone already. I may have laughed too hard when he said, \"Next year I'm gifting y'all photos of things I do every day.\"", "You nailed it!", "Wait this is an annual gift?"]}
