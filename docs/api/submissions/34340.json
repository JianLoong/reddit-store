About a third of the room I have made into a little yoga/pilates studio. I have plants everywhere and all of my equipment is coordinated to the decor- a great little zen spot if I do say so myself.

Anyway, he says he\u2019s going to put it in the sunroom. I told him no and said he could put it in the guest room, his room or the garage.

If he's getting dedicated private space then its fair for you to also have a space that's yours. If he wants to share the sunroom then a discussion needs to be had about him using space in the home for his hobbies and not allowing you a dedicated space.", "NTA you husband has his own dedicated room, this is his thing, it should go in there if you don't want it in the room that you use regularly. Fairly straight-forward and this comes from someone with a Peloton (tell him I said you are right).

You have your yoga/pilates space that you designed yourself, and if a Peloton *can* fit, he's thinking it might be a good spot.\n\nThat said, if you've designed it to be coordinated with everything else, then I can also understand why something that doesn't fit the aesthetic would be something you wouldn't want in your room.  \n\nIf it doesn't sound like he's coming into this situation demanding that the Peloton go in the sunroom, he's likely just thinking that it's a piece of workout equipment, and this is where we work out, so naturally, it makes sense to go here.\n\nThat's when you come in and say \"hey listen, I understand that it makes some sense to put the workout equipment in the workout room, but I think it'll take up too much space.  The guest room seems like a decent place though because really the only time we use that room is when guests are over.  Would you be okay with that, and we can add some additional workout aesthetic to make it feel like less of a guest room and more of *your* place to work out?\"\n\nOr something like that.

Why the change now ?", "NTA, I'm currently having this fight with my wife over her wanting it in the damn living room.

I've offered to decorate any way she likes, add extra lighting, build a separate workout room, add a sound system, anything to not have that ugly thing next to the fireplace", "NTA.\n\nMainly because you don't technically have a dedicated room (he does) and have made the best of it with a shared room. You've done so well, he now wants *your* limited space as well as his own. \n\nThere are other areas in the house that *he* could work on and adjust to achieve a similar comfort level, and you have been flexible offering those.

Then he would have more room for the Peloton and would have the chance to give the space a makeover so that it suited him the way the sunroom suits you.", "Nta he has a dedicated room AND a shared room.
