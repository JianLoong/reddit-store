About a third of the room I have made into a little yoga/pilates studio. I have plants everywhere and all of my equipment is coordinated to the decor- a great little zen spot if I do say so myself.

Anyway, he says he\u2019s going to put it in the sunroom. I told him no and said he could put it in the guest room, his room or the garage.

If he's getting dedicated private space then its fair for you to also have a space that's yours. If he wants to share the sunroom then a discussion needs to be had about him using space in the home for his hobbies and not allowing you a dedicated space.", "NTA you husband has his own dedicated room, this is his thing, it should go in there if you don't want it in the room that you use regularly. Fairly straight-forward and this comes from someone with a Peloton (tell him I said you are right).

You have your yoga/pilates space that you designed yourself, and if a Peloton *can* fit, he's thinking it might be a good spot.\n\nThat said, if you've designed it to be coordinated with everything else, then I can also understand why something that doesn't fit the aesthetic would be something you wouldn't want in your room.  \n\nIf it doesn't sound like he's coming into this situation demanding that the Peloton go in the sunroom, he's likely just thinking that it's a piece of workout equipment, and this is where we work out, so naturally, it makes sense to go here.\n\nThat's when you come in and say \"hey listen, I understand that it makes some sense to put the workout equipment in the workout room, but I think it'll take up too much space.  The guest room seems like a decent place though because really the only time we use that room is when guests are over.  Would you be okay with that, and we can add some additional workout aesthetic to make it feel like less of a guest room and more of *your* place to work out?\"\n\nOr something like that.

I've offered to decorate any way she likes, add extra lighting, build a separate workout room, add a sound system, anything to not have that ugly thing next to the fireplace", "NTA.\n\nMainly because you don't technically have a dedicated room (he does) and have made the best of it with a shared room. You've done so well, he now wants *your* limited space as well as his own. \n\nThere are other areas in the house that *he* could work on and adjust to achieve a similar comfort level, and you have been flexible offering those.

You make a good argument \\*from your point of view,\\* but think about it from your husband's point of view:\n\n1: You two share a bedroom, but your clothes take up all of the space there -- he has to keep his clothes in the guest room. So, the guest room is not \"his room.\" It's where he's allowed to (or is forced to) put his clothes.\n\n2: He has the smallest bedroom as his man cave. You don't say what he has in there or how small it is. (Often these smallest bedrooms are 9-11 feet square, meant for kids rooms or home offices.) It does seem as though that small room is his to do with as he likes. But a small bedroom is probably not big enough to do much more than house a computer and such.\n\n3: Then, there's the sunroom, which you say is a larger space and has been designated, for the most part, as yours. I am guessing it is also one of your nicest spaces, because of natural light/windows, the decor, the location in the house, the amount of space there is, and the fact that you want to to have that as your space, and your husband would ALSO like a piece of it, because, as he said, it's the nicest room in the house.\n\nAll of this, you said, is the way it has been designated. Who decided who got what spaces? It sounds like your husband would like a say in changing the designations. How often do you have guests over? It seems to me that priority for space in the nicest room in the house is given to: you, plants, yoga mats, and the possibility of guests?\n\nAs partners who pay for and share a house together, you ought to consider accommodating his request. From an outsiders perspective (mine anyway), it sounds like you are squishing your husband over into the less desirable areas of the house, so you can have things \"just so\", and not even giving him space in his own bedroom to have his clothes (he has to go to a different room to get dressed?)\n\nThis is the kind of thing that will make him feel unwelcome in his own home, and he may grow to resent you to making him feel less important than plants and the possibility of guests. We don't all have the same taste in decor or how our homes should be used. Why does he not get a say? Essentially telling him that only you get to decide how space is used in the house is, frankly, selfish. And while women often like to decorate a house with their taste in things, it is reasonable to know that our partner may place value on the function of items in the house that may clash with the decor. Nobody should get more of a say than the other person.\n\nA good compromise might be to come up with a plan to rearrange that room to accommodate the bike. And you may even say that while it's not your preference to have his bike there, as long as he uses it (and doesn't just \"store\" the bike there), you're fine with it being there. In fact, is there any reason you couldn't exercise together? I think in this case, you can make your marriage better/happier, or you can put another wall between you and your husband.\n\n(TL/DR: Your husband should get an equal say in how the space in your home is used.

Well, that is unless he takes over the space that OP spent time and effort making nice for her own use.  He didn't \"give her the nicer room.\"  He took the third bedroom all for himself as a \"man cave\" and she carved her space out of 1/3 of a common room.  The rest of the room is a sunroom where they entertain and that is used by both of them.  He wants to take over the center part of that, blocking access to the backyard, rather than put the Peleton in his own damn room or the garage or even taking over part of the guest room.  What's next?  Just shove all of OP's stuff into a closet because her husband wants even more space dedicated just for him?\n\nSure, I'd rather exercise where it's light and airy, but OP's husband doesn't have that option because of choices he and they made when setting up their home.  He wasn't upset to get the entire third bedroom for himself, so he doesn't get to be upset that OP refuses to give up the space she made for herself out of part of another room.", "Why is it the nicest? \n\nBecause she decorated it and laid it out.", "I can see that, but I was replying to someone saying she had more space than him right now, so she'd be unhappy if he actually accepted her trade.

Cutting off your own nose to spite your face.", "I'd much rather take a sunroom than the tiny bedroom personally. I mean, by all means let him choose if she wants to, but it sounds like she has a much better space. Doesn't sound like she carved out a space, as much as made 1/3rd of one of the larger rooms dedicated to her, while he made the smallest room dedicated to him. Their spaces sound pretty fair to be honest, the trade off being that he gets solitude, she gets a nice view, light, yard out the window, a couch a table, though those might be shared with company over. \n\nMy ex and I had the same set up basically, but I was on the other side. My girlfriend had a room that was all hers. I had the covered lanei. She had her box to do whatever she pleased with. I had the huge porch. We both had comfy chairs on the porch, it had a table and it was where I had my computer set up, would read, and my little garden area. She'd come out and set up her yoga stuff, almost always had a puzzle on the table and it's where she and I and usually company would hang out.\n\nSo she had a lady cave and I had the lenai. I can't imagine forbidding her from setting up her yoga area there. OPs dynamic sounds off, if she needs more of a dedicated space of her own, which it sounds like a lot of the room is already dedicated to, maybe they should switch. It's not a common room if she forbides him from taking some space in it. Again, isn't peleton just an exercise bike, i could be wrong?\n\nWe don't have the knowledge to judge for sure, but come on, ask anyone, what sounds nicer, the tiny bedroom, or the backyard sunroom? Also, if she is so adverse to sharing the space with random people, take out the table or the couch and there is plenty of room for his gear, which can be put out of view when not in use. It's not like she is eeking out a corner in a crowded house, they are a couple.", "OP never said that. What they did say was that his room was the smallest bedroom in the house, and that the sunroom was the way to get out to the garden. Are you familiar with sunrooms? They\u2019re essentially walled in patios. Lots of natural light, you can see out to the garden. That sounds a lot better than a small bedroom or the garage, doesn\u2019t it?", "Right, that's what I thought you were saying. :) lol", "Hahahaha I saw that!
