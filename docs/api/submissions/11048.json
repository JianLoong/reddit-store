That wouldn't make you an asshole.   \nBut what makes YTA is saying that you will babysit, just to change your mind last second, leaving no time for your sister to find a replacement.

This wasn't something your sister could reschedule! You were selfish and immature.  You're old enough to know that if you make a commitment,  you stick with it. \n\nYou owe her a massive apology.

Yikes. The entitlement is strong in you. No, people don\u2019t accept commitments like this with the thought that they will simply \u201cchange their mind\u201d whenever they feel like it.

She did not take care of getting a different babysitter because she had one, you - she thought she had a responsible adult and family member to take care of her child. Turn out, no. If you hadn't offered to do it, she would have found someone else in the meantime. But just saying and then going back on your word, this is far worse than not offering at all.", "YTA! This has got to be fake. No one is that stupid and inconsiderate.", "YTA no one could be this obtuse.", "Yta. She should be grateful no matter what?? For what? For someone who makes commitments they dont keep and then putting her in a worse position of having to find a sitter at last minute instead of weeks ago when you said you\u2019d do it. Like you\u2019re so entitled and to what? If you would\u2019ve said no in the first place it would\u2019ve been easier on your sister.

Bruh. It's not like she was just running to the mall for a few hours to hang out without her kid. She was going to a wedding. Not just any wedding, but her best friend's wedding.
