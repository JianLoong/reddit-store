After they turn 18, my kids know they\u2019re on their own. Third, this kinda reminds me of panhandlers who ask for money to get something to eat, and then get pissed when you give them food instead of giving up cash.

Never discuss it again, that deal had an expiration date and it's passed.  Your daughter has a safe place to live with you, and her bf has a safe place with his parents.  That's more than a lot of people in their situation.  If they want to get a place of their own they have to figure out how to make it happen.  They will quickly learn that what they can find, even with gov't assistance, probably isn't as nice as where they are living now - and there's a long wait list for gov't assistance.\n\nGiven Katie's age she's probably still on your health insurance, which is fine.  Katie should be attending her pre-natal visits.  Check your policy to see if her baby will be covered or not.  If not, that has to be figured out quickly.  Hopefully Matt's job offers it as a benefit.  If not, look into SCHIP.  That should happen before the birth and before the child lands in the NICU (which hopefully won't happen).  Katie should sign up for WIC.\n\nMatt needs to understand that once Katie applies for WIC & SCHIP that the state will put him on child support automatically and garnish his paychecks.  The taxpayers are not expected to support a child when there is an employed dad in the picture who can pay.\n\nGiving gas money to Matt also has to stop; you're enabling not just Katie's poor financial decisions but Matt's as well.  Neither will grow up and learn unless you cut them off.\n\nThat doesn't mean you won't be helping your grandchild.  You can purchase a car seat, clothing, diapers, crib, etc.  You can babysit while Katie works, and it will likely be more convenient if the child is living with you at the time.

Just let him stay a few nights for that.\" Then it will be, \"Mom, he really wants to be involved with helping me at night. Can he just stay every once in a while? I swear, we're looking for our own place.\" \n\nBe prepared for pushback when you say no. It will start with him coming to visit and then falling asleep while feeding the baby.

When you still say no, then she'll start fighting with you and accusing you of sabotaging their family, wanting them to fail, anything to try and make you feel guilty. \n\nNow, if you finally give in because it's easier than arguing (like my friend did), you will have two young adults and a baby who pretty much take over your home by using the baby as a bargaining chip. You will be paying for EVERYTHING. They will use his paycheck for their wants, and you will have to pay for all their needs when they come to you three days after payday with their hands out, telling you that they're broke. When you say no, all hell will break loose, and they will do everything possible to make you uncomfortable in your own home. They will withhold the baby, whatever it takes to break you down.\n\nMy friend has been dealing with this for two years. She has tried to help them get their own place, to no avail. The last time she brought it up to them, they told her it would be easier for her to get an apartment and just leave the house to them since they're going to get it when she dies anyway and why should they have to move twice. She came to me last week crying about how she's going to have to file an eviction against her own daughter, and she'll never see her grandson again because of it. \n\nThat is what happens when you let the baby's father (or mother, depending on the situation) move in. Not in every situation, but in situations where the writing is already on the wall, like yours is. All that being said, what you're proposing is also risky. You said you would pay half the rent, but who's going to pay the other half? Not them. They aren't even responsible enough to put money aside for gas. Do you think they're going to put it aside for rent? No. They're going to come to you with some sob story every month and beg you to pay the other half because they are broke. And if you don't and they get evicted, you will not only lose your deposit, but they will expect to move in with you as a family because they have already been living together and who knows if his parents will take him back.\n\nI think the best solution here would be to leave it alone. No more handouts. No more loans. She gets a roof over her head at your house, and he gets one with his parents.

Honestly, most people that offer this kind of assistance would like to pay directly for the services needed rather than give cash.  It\u2019s micromanaging, but reduces waste.  If they don\u2019t like it, they can pay all of their own bills.", "when my son was about 18 he was living with 3 other people.  he lost his job and was broke, he called me asking for money for food.  So I 20 odd years ago thought about it and went to Superstore (only one in Yukon - Brand new) and spent $100,00 plus a little and bought things like flour, shortening, some meat etc.  (what your dollar can buy now is not even close).  I also meal planned and gave recipes. it was enough for 4 people for 2 meals a day for a week.  If I gave just cash it would have been gone in 24 hours on take out.   \n They were all shocked and so happy with my gift, my son still almost weekly asks for recipes now almost 40.  Bottom line I could have given him money for a day of take out, but I instead gave him and his friends a lifetime of culinary questions!", "My 8 month old needs a ps5 with the call of duty expansion pack", "Never understood the horse metaphor", "You keep saying \u2018they\u2019, when in reality it\u2019s her boyfriend as your daughter has proven herself entitled and irresponsible. \n\nThe way she\u2019s going, she will end up a single mother to more than one child that will end up your responsibility to raise. \n\nHonestly, OP? I find your attitude about your daughter\u2019s decision making fairly concerning. She doesn\u2019t want to do school, gets knocked up\u2014probably on purpose, quits work, and still lives with you. And you\u2019re willing to stand as an enabler to her lack of focus, discipline, and direction\u2014 now she\u2019s dragging a helpless child into the situation. Without requiring a timeline toward self sufficiency. Without stipulations. Telling them both that you will help with childcare all the time and provide for their child, which will only guarantee that neither of them ever steps up to be the parents that child needs and deserves.\n\nThis isn\u2019t helping her grow up and it damn sure isn\u2019t going to help when being a parent is \u2018too much\u2019 and \u2018too hard\u2019. \n\nThe reason I am urging you to really think about what you are doing is that I know too many parents who are not only still raising their adult children but their grandchildren. And nobody is happy or enjoying this lifestyle. Your duty was to raise your children into responsible adults capable of being independent. Not to foster generational irresponsibility. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a choice concerning financial literacy now, she\u2019s going to be a parent. She doesn\u2019t want to work? Tough\u2026 she\u2019s going to have to do that and still raise her child. Has she even thought about what should happen if her boyfriend decides to leave her and abandon his responsibilities towards this child? What\u2019s her plan should this happen. There are realities that need to be addressed here, sooner rather than later.", "So you aren\u2019t willing to \u201cpenalize\u201d your grandchild bc the parents. But here\u2019s the thing: 1) You aren\u2019t penalizing the grandkid bc it isn\u2019t your job to provide for them. That\u2019s the parents job. 2) Your daughter got pregnant when she could not even support herself and then quit her job voluntarily when she found out. \n\nYou should have told her a condition for her continuing to live with you is that she has full time employment. Bc what happens when they don\u2019t take you up on your offer and Kate and baby just stay in your house freeloading? I tell you what will happen, she will keep popping out babies.", "The fact that you're offering all this without even suggesting your daughter return to work before you help them perfectly illustrates why she believes that once she spends all her money more will just appear.

But if she was showing no desire or ability to be financially sensible, then removing your financial support would have been a good first step \n\nHeck, just charge her rent that you turned into her savings would have been fine.\n\nIt's a lot harder now because of the baby..", "But she doesn't figure anything out, she comes running to you.
