After they turn 18, my kids know they\u2019re on their own. Third, this kinda reminds me of panhandlers who ask for money to get something to eat, and then get pissed when you give them food instead of giving up cash.

Never discuss it again, that deal had an expiration date and it's passed.  Your daughter has a safe place to live with you, and her bf has a safe place with his parents.  That's more than a lot of people in their situation.  If they want to get a place of their own they have to figure out how to make it happen.  They will quickly learn that what they can find, even with gov't assistance, probably isn't as nice as where they are living now - and there's a long wait list for gov't assistance.\n\nGiven Katie's age she's probably still on your health insurance, which is fine.  Katie should be attending her pre-natal visits.  Check your policy to see if her baby will be covered or not.  If not, that has to be figured out quickly.  Hopefully Matt's job offers it as a benefit.  If not, look into SCHIP.  That should happen before the birth and before the child lands in the NICU (which hopefully won't happen).  Katie should sign up for WIC.\n\nMatt needs to understand that once Katie applies for WIC & SCHIP that the state will put him on child support automatically and garnish his paychecks.  The taxpayers are not expected to support a child when there is an employed dad in the picture who can pay.\n\nGiving gas money to Matt also has to stop; you're enabling not just Katie's poor financial decisions but Matt's as well.  Neither will grow up and learn unless you cut them off.\n\nThat doesn't mean you won't be helping your grandchild.  You can purchase a car seat, clothing, diapers, crib, etc.  You can babysit while Katie works, and it will likely be more convenient if the child is living with you at the time.

Just let him stay a few nights for that.\" Then it will be, \"Mom, he really wants to be involved with helping me at night. Can he just stay every once in a while? I swear, we're looking for our own place.\" \n\nBe prepared for pushback when you say no. It will start with him coming to visit and then falling asleep while feeding the baby.

When you still say no, then she'll start fighting with you and accusing you of sabotaging their family, wanting them to fail, anything to try and make you feel guilty. \n\nNow, if you finally give in because it's easier than arguing (like my friend did), you will have two young adults and a baby who pretty much take over your home by using the baby as a bargaining chip. You will be paying for EVERYTHING. They will use his paycheck for their wants, and you will have to pay for all their needs when they come to you three days after payday with their hands out, telling you that they're broke. When you say no, all hell will break loose, and they will do everything possible to make you uncomfortable in your own home. They will withhold the baby, whatever it takes to break you down.\n\nMy friend has been dealing with this for two years. She has tried to help them get their own place, to no avail. The last time she brought it up to them, they told her it would be easier for her to get an apartment and just leave the house to them since they're going to get it when she dies anyway and why should they have to move twice. She came to me last week crying about how she's going to have to file an eviction against her own daughter, and she'll never see her grandson again because of it. \n\nThat is what happens when you let the baby's father (or mother, depending on the situation) move in. Not in every situation, but in situations where the writing is already on the wall, like yours is. All that being said, what you're proposing is also risky. You said you would pay half the rent, but who's going to pay the other half? Not them. They aren't even responsible enough to put money aside for gas. Do you think they're going to put it aside for rent? No. They're going to come to you with some sob story every month and beg you to pay the other half because they are broke. And if you don't and they get evicted, you will not only lose your deposit, but they will expect to move in with you as a family because they have already been living together and who knows if his parents will take him back.\n\nI think the best solution here would be to leave it alone. No more handouts. No more loans. She gets a roof over her head at your house, and he gets one with his parents.

With your system, you know exactly where your money is going. If they are too good for your conditions, they can find a way to support themselves.", "NTA\n\nI thought that was an extremely generous offer. They're getting what they NEED, but not what they want. They aren't ready for a baby at all.", "NTA but you might want to rethink the support you are offering, it's not actually support you are enabling them, they will never learn to grow up and be good with money if you are paying for all this for them, and unfortunately it may take them hitting rock bottom to learn that they need to work and and manage their money sensibly, paying deposit and such is find but paying car insurance and half the rent is not good", "I don\u2019t understand why people quit working when they find out they are pregnant. I got pregnant at 18 and continued working, morning sickness and all, until I was 8 1/2 months pregnant. On my feet in a restaurant.

But this sounds like a possible hidden addiction ofsome kind.", "OP you are more generous than my parents would have been. My dad's idea of The Talk was either, \"sex is messy. You won't like it.\" or, \"Don't come home pregnant.\" No lie on either one. In the case of the first one, it was messy, but I did like it. LOL and I didn't get PG until I had been married for 6 years.\n\nFor you to be willing to cover half yhecrent and all baby necessities is super generous. \n\nNTA", "I do not understand why this young woman is actually planning to give birth and keep the baby. This saddens me.", "I'd say extraordinarily generous", "Also like, it\u2019s two people that still live with their parents that got pregnant", "You're NTA but tbh I would add the caveat that she needs to return to work. Why tf did your daughter think it was a good idea to quit her job on the day she found out she was pregnant?!? You said that she's having an easy pregnancy so it's not like she had health complications that forced her to go out on temporary leave. And now is the time to be saving money for all the expenses that come with raising a child. The entitlement of the two of them is astounding.", "Nta. I think your heart is in the right place, but the best thing you can do for your future grandchild to push your daughter and her bf to be independent as soon as possible. \n\nThey need a major reality check, the sooner the better, for the sake of their future child. Stop enabling their terrible decisions. I would also google \"toxic enabling\" and co dependency.", "Your offer is incredibly generous.  Your daughter and her BF are two able-bodied adults.  Even if they're not very financially literate, they don't need to be to understand that they should both be working full time to save support themselves until it's time to go off and have that baby.  Hold firm, or you'll be stuck supporting all three of them for the next 18+ years.  NTA", "It isn't poor financial literacy, it's poor spending habits.

You're basically going to pay the half of every thing they need when they move. And the part you're forgetting is the additional money they will be asking for after they run through their paycheck. \n\nNtA. \n\nBut make a budget with how much money you top them off with through the month.", "I think paying for half of their rent by default is still enabling them. Because then they will still not pay their half and ask you for that too. Why not just pay for things for baby like diapers and leave them responsible for rent? They may need tough love where they become homeless (you can always take in your grandchild) before they understand that they need to save. There are good odds that they are like this because of being enabled up until now", "Your daughter is not mature enough to be a parent. She quit her job when she found out. Helping them now is a bad idea, you're setting yourself up for supporting them forever. They need to face the reality of their situation and start making rational decisions. She needs a job. They need an apartment they can afford on their budget.  They need to stop wasting money. If they know you'll always be there with a chequebook they will never grow up.

Her first action on learning that she was pregnant was to quit her job...  I'm generally a bit skeptical of people who blame parents for their adult offsprings' problematic behaviors, but I admit that I'm wondering how your daughter grew up assuming that this was an acceptable way to behave. I just can't picture this level of entitlement/irresponsibility emerging from nowhere... From your perspective, how did she come to be this way? Does she have  a diagnosed impairment?", "Yeah, like he pays his own gas now. Where your daughter asks you for gas money for him.\n\nIt's going to be this all the time.", "What do you think will happen when they decide to not pay half of rent or the electric bills? They will ask you to pay for everything \u201cfor the baby\u201d. It\u2019s pretty obvious that you\u2019ve been enabling them until now and have created this problem to some extent. Tough love is the only way to get them to see the light. Personally, in your shoes I would only pay for baby items and if they fall homeless, you\u2019ll take in their baby and they can go to a homeless shelter. I don\u2019t think they will learn until actual consequences bite them in the ass.", "Are you willing to see them evicted because the only part of the rent that's going to be paid is the half you pay? No. I didn't think so. In reality, you are on the hook for all the rent.", "NTA  \nYou\u2019re actually setting them up for disaster. They\u2019re both grown adults. Stop enabling bad behavior, laziness and lackadaisical behavior.\nAnd she\u2019ll probably keep getting pregnant & giving birth back to back to kids that they won\u2019t be able to cater to if anything happens to you.", "If they take up your offer, you need to warn them about what you\u2019re not gonna pay. Who will be paying for the kids health insurance, who will be paying for your daughters health insurance once she turns 26, who will be paying for repairs for the car, what will happen if they want a better place (will you pay more?), what will happen if they don\u2019t pay for their half of the rent, when u will stop paying, will you be paying more money if she gets pregnant again or will you only still pay for the same things, once the kid turns 5 and in school will your daughter get a job? \nAlso what will happen if they break up? Have you talked to your daughter about what will happen if they break up and he moves out? \n\nYour heart is in the right place, but your daughter needs to grow up. She is choosing to bring a child into this world. It sounds like you have done everything you can to make your daughter\u2019s life better, but she needs grit. She needs to learn how to over come obstacles and how to make ends meet. She needs to be someone her daughter will look up to and say, my mom had me young but she did everything to give me the best life. Instead you have a daughter who is not working or saving money for her kid and is whining about not having full access to your bank account. What your offering is amazing but until you learn to put your foot down you will be teaching your daughter that she is the most important person not her daughter.", "I would have them sit down with a financial planner who can (maybe) open their eyes to reality in budgeting and what they're going to need long term. They might listen to an unrelated person.", "Matt? Or Mike? Or she has TWO boyfriends?", "If \u201cthey\u2019ll just figure it out\u201d let them. Let them fail spectacularly or figure it out.

Did she even tell you she was going to quit her job upon falling pregnant?!", "She won\u2019t care to learn because mummy is enabling her irresponsibility by constantly bailing her out.", "Then that should be your answer- you said you would just figure it out.", "Seems like it's time for her to figure it out. Coming to you is not figuring it out, but you've allowed it to be.", "And yeah, it will be fine, because you will always plug the gaps. She'll never have to face real world consequences and never have to grow up and take responsibility.\n\nI know you want to help, but financially propping them up is not going to help them learn or grow. The amount of help you are proposing is ridiculous. They need to pay at least their own rent and bills - fair enough if you want to buy things for the baby, even fair enough to help them with a bond for their rental, but they need to figure out how they are going to handle their ongoing finances. Otherwise you will be paying forever. I think you are being YTA to yourself to be honest.", "[removed]", "Half of the rent, all of the utilities, his car if he has one, feeding themselves, furnishings.

Just the opposite.   She's being taught that Mommy will bail her out.\n\nWhen OP said there was a caveat, I thought it would be the daughter getting a job---a job with health insurance.  \n\n I can not fathom the thought process that leads to quitting a job when I have a baby on the way.
