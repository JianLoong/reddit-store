After they turn 18, my kids know they\u2019re on their own. Third, this kinda reminds me of panhandlers who ask for money to get something to eat, and then get pissed when you give them food instead of giving up cash.

Never discuss it again, that deal had an expiration date and it's passed.  Your daughter has a safe place to live with you, and her bf has a safe place with his parents.  That's more than a lot of people in their situation.  If they want to get a place of their own they have to figure out how to make it happen.  They will quickly learn that what they can find, even with gov't assistance, probably isn't as nice as where they are living now - and there's a long wait list for gov't assistance.\n\nGiven Katie's age she's probably still on your health insurance, which is fine.  Katie should be attending her pre-natal visits.  Check your policy to see if her baby will be covered or not.  If not, that has to be figured out quickly.  Hopefully Matt's job offers it as a benefit.  If not, look into SCHIP.  That should happen before the birth and before the child lands in the NICU (which hopefully won't happen).  Katie should sign up for WIC.\n\nMatt needs to understand that once Katie applies for WIC & SCHIP that the state will put him on child support automatically and garnish his paychecks.  The taxpayers are not expected to support a child when there is an employed dad in the picture who can pay.\n\nGiving gas money to Matt also has to stop; you're enabling not just Katie's poor financial decisions but Matt's as well.  Neither will grow up and learn unless you cut them off.\n\nThat doesn't mean you won't be helping your grandchild.  You can purchase a car seat, clothing, diapers, crib, etc.  You can babysit while Katie works, and it will likely be more convenient if the child is living with you at the time.

I'll always help with my grandchild.", "I've tried teaching Kate financial literacy. Absolutely no interest or willingness to learn. Its always, omg mooom, it doesn't matter, we'll just figure it out, it'll be fine", "I'm going to respect whatever my daughter chooses in regards to feeding her baby. Her baby, her body, her choice. As a mom, I'd not want anyone telling me how to use my body.", "I also am suspicious of a substance or gambling addiction.", "From reading the comments it sounds like OPs daughter has little to no impulse control and has basically decided that \"my focus needs to be on the baby\", regardless of the actual realities of the financial situation.\n\nIn my experience people who struggle with money fall into two main camps. The first really do their best but find that the money doesn't quite reach the end of the month (especially in the current cost of living crisis), no amount of budgeting is going to fix the issue because the issue genuinely can't be fixed.\n\nThe second are people like OPs daughter, who just flat out don't care and expect that the problem will resolve itself. This also falls in with the lack of impulse control. They want it so they'll get it, doesn't matter that the money they just used was supposed to buy food for the next week, we'll borrow that from somewhere.", "Reverse order: they are acting like children because she indulges them like children and gives them everything so they have no reason to change. Why should they? Everything is working out just fine for them with Mom footing most of the bills for Kate and (Matt's dad apparently footing his bills) and zero responsibility for the daughter other than to lie back and make babies apparently.", "I think the commenter was saying your daughter and her BF were expecting you to cover everything and the fact you\u2019re covering what you HAVE offered plus caveat is more than reasonable compared to what they hoped (everything)", "Well since you\u2019re not forcing them to accept your help then that is on them. Tell them fine good luck", "What you listed is not making them responsible for the majority of their living expenses.  Not by any stretch of the imagination.", "Did you offer to pay for an abortion? That is probably the most helpful thing you could do.....", "Would they spend it on themselves if you gave them gift cards to places like Target? My thought there being that it might save you quite a lot of time/effort if you could give them gift cards to Target and Carter's and so on, rather than having to do all the purchases yourself, but they wouldn't be able to go spend it partying (as easily).", "I'm going to respect whatever my daughter chooses in regards to feeding her baby. Her baby, her body, her choice. As a mom, I'd not want anyone telling me how to use my body.", "You are paying half the rent, the deposit, utilities to start, then anything they need for the baby. If they were unable to pay rent, would you be covering that too? Are they going to use the baby as a bargaining chip? I can imagine the sentence \u201cWhat! You want your grandchild to be homeless?\u201d the minute they spend all their money and can\u2019t pay rent. \n\nThat\u2019s what I mean when I say you are supporting them financially in full.", "Yea so realistically they will probably continue to get by just on Matt's salary.  Which is my point agreeing to cover her half of the rent and continue to pay her personal bills you're treating her like a child when she's about to have a child.  \n\nI think it's great you want to help but if you're offering that much there needs to be an end date set ahead of time.  If not I don't see your daughter going back to work.  Especially when she showed her priorities when she quit her job the moment she found out she was pregnant. She probably already knew you would bail her out.", "Still too much. They got pregnant and are not financially, nor apparently mature enough to handle it.  Wait til the baby comes. See if Matt even sticks around, or if you become a full time babysitter. They made their bed, the should be taught how to lie in it themselves.", "I'd also discuss this agreement ending after kid is of a specified age. That she is up to you and you should also specify if you'll help again if she has more kids. \n\nNTA \n\nHonestly your already massively babying them both.", "You should definitely edit in that you put a time limit.  If nothing else will cut down on the comments telling you to do so.  Also, NTA.", "I'd require a parenting and financial literacy/ budgeting class. \n\nI'd also tell them they need to track their spending and send you their expenses before paying for anything. Why? Because they'll start seeing they spend $150 here, $200 there, etc. Tell their mooching, financially irresponsible asses you want receipts. \"You spend $250 on beer this month. You spent $95 on drinks and snacks at gas stations this month. You spend $200 on takeout. If you'd shopped at a grocery store and cut beer back, you'd have saved over $300. That is your entire gas expenses. That is most of your food.\"\n\nMake them explain how they are spending their money and justify asking for things. Baby gets taken care of, but eventually, they'll see how much they are absolutely bleeding in stupid expenses. Until they are held accountable every single month for what they are doing, there is no lesson learned.\n\nThey won't just magically learn how to budget if you end up paying 100% of baby stuff and half their rent. In one year they'll just end up short half their rent and ask you for it again.", "Honestly why would she care?  Mom always bails her out. Part of parenting is sometimes letting our children fail. Failure teaches more than our bailing them out. I agree with not giving money but would not pay half the rent. Basically that allows your daughter to not have to work. They\u2019re about to bring a living dependent human being into the world. Let them stand and learn.", "Make a financial planning class a requirement for your assistance. They are clearly in need. You don't let your child tell you it doesn't matter whether they brush their teeth or do their homework; it is a requirement. Your daughter is still a child. \n\nAlthough if they don't care, they may not get much from a financial planning class. But even exposure is a beginning. I just worry for you that you're setting yourself up for a lifetime of supporting your daughter and her family if you don't force a change in their attitudes and behaviors.", "You need to let her figure it out, because you haven\u2019t taught her a thing!! Give her no money period, tell her to get a job and figure it out! She can stay with you until she does. Bailing her out by paying her 1/2 rent isn\u2019t teaching her anything.", "You need to let her fail OP.... take custody of the baby or put it up for adoption. Really force her to think about this.", "Have you tried using budget programs? I can recommend You Need A Budget (YNAB).", "Is there a chance that she thinks it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d and \u201cit\u2019ll be fine\u201d because those things are true? Because you tend to solve problems she created herself? I\u2019m just saying, a grown woman often doesn\u2019t talk like a whiny child unless she\u2019s getting rewarded for behaving like one.", "INFO what was her logic for quitting her job?  I have worked with soo many women and have worked until the day the baby arrives, and I always wonder the person reasoning/logic for quitting as soon as they find out.  Please enlighten me.", "I wasn't implying for you to order her what to do with her body.   Just to point out to her the cost of formula  as opposed to nursing.", "I\u2019d start the GoFundMe myself.", "There's a whole racket where you can sell gift cards online for cash", "And she'll probably just keep getting pregnant.", "Totally agree", "Basically, daughter doesn't have to suffer any practical consequences.", "OP is in the quandary that a lot of grandparents end up in, which is that they don't want to punish their grandchildren to teach their child a lesson.", "This!!", "And a parenting class.\n\nHonestly, this plan seems doomed to fail. OP will buy 100% of things for baby plus half rent so they can buy video games and beer as they play house. There's no incentive to actually work for anything.\n\nI'd tell them the rent only happens if she gets reports on how they are spending money. \"You said you earned 1563.18 cents. You only sent me exependitures for 964.89. Where is the other $600 you should still have?\"\n\nIf they don't like explaining their budgeting to mommy, they can be adults and cover their own shit.", "I will look into that. All my experience is from years ago with quicken, quick books, and peachtree lol", "I was at work up until the day before I gave birth with both of my kids. My water broke at work with my oldest. Granted I was working office jobs both times, but I've known plenty of women working in restaurants when I did that work who worked through their whole pregnancy.", "I worked until 2 weeks before I gave birth then took maternity leave until baby was 5 weeks, now I'm a stay at home mom since my husband has found a better paying job closer to home\n\nI also got pregnant at 20 and was still living at home when I first found out, but grew up and did what I had to for my child and my parents only pay for the fun grandparent things like bigger toys and cute outfits we don't need", "Not everyone is able to nurse.  Supply issues are way more common than a lot of people talk about", "That\u2019s exactly that I thought. There will be no thinking about if they can afford baby number 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 because OP will pay for it.", "Lots of bank apps have spending trackers and budget help, the tracker will show where your wasting money and your saving options. My young adult sons use it and realized how much eating out was adding upto, and was shocked, he could of bought this of that on his list for the waste of money on convenience eating. Maybe your kids have this or can get the app and learn to use, might help when they see the totals of their fun times, compared to their budget on expenses,  which will only get bigger and bigger as they have a child.\n\nAdd: some tips I  suggest to any new parents,  thrift cloths are great for kids cloths, especially babies most grow so fast they wear once and new cloths cost lots and blow budgets quick, and please watch out for plastic addiction,  aka toys, they really don't need many the first 2 years and lots of marketing goes into making parents think they need all that stuff, but find out quickly they wasted money on useless crap your constantly cleaning up.\n\nGoodluck", "There are great resources at the Better Money Habits web site, she can watch videos and do lessons.
