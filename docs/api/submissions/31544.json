Alexis has a lot of health issues. We\u2019ve been in and out of the hospital for months. \n\nSomething important to know is that Alexis has a picc line (big take home iv) and is getting blood thinner injections every day so we do have needles and vials around the house. She also occasionally gets pain meds through her picc line. \n\nMy sister has 2 kids, Andrew (12) and Alyssa (9). She brought them to the house to play with my kids not too long ago. \n\nAlexis had a minor procedure a couple days before they came. I was showing my sister a video of Alexis at the house right after the procedure. She was still very high and it was hilarious (she\u2019s fine with me showing family these videos). Andrew came into the kitchen, heard the video, and asked what it was. I said that I was just showing his mom a video of alexis after she got some pain meds. \n\nA few hours later the kids were grabbing a snack and Andrew took the container with needles and vials of the blood thinner out of the pantry. He asked what it is and I said it\u2019s Alexis\u2019s medicine. \n\nMy sister and I left to take our dogs for a walk and I wanted to get a snack out of the pantry when we came back. I noticed Alexis\u2019s medicine box was moved so I looked at it and one of the blood thinner vials was a lot more empty than before and a needle/syringe was missing. \n\nSister and I interrogated all of the kids and we found out Andrew gave himself a high dose of the blood thinner because he thought it was her pain meds and he wanted to get high. \n\nMy sister rushed Andrew to the hospital and he stayed overnight. Now she\u2019s sending me the hospital bill because I was the one that left the medicine where he could get it. I\u2019m refusing to pay because if my 11 and 12 year old boys and 8 year old girl know not to touch other peoples medicines, her 12 year old should be able to see a vial and syringe and not drug himself. \n\nShe\u2019s threatening to sue and I really don\u2019t want to go the legal route with this. AITA for not paying the hospital bills?\n\nEdit: I would like to clear this up. This is an injection, not an infusion. All you need to do is inject it into the subcutaneous tissue and I don\u2019t even know if he did that correctly.

He stole your child's medication with the intent to get high. He's old enough to know better than to steal someone's medication and your sister needs to get in front of this quickly before she ends up with an addict on her hands.", "NTA. Your nephew did something extremely foolish, and he should have known better. He\u2019s not  toddler playing with sharp objects left laying around. \n\nHe\u2019s a 12 year old budding addict.

Your sister has a huge problem and it has nothing to do with a 12 year old who doesn't know not to touch other people's medicine.  No, it's worse than that.  Andrew knew what he was doing was wrong, but was motivated to do it anyway, to get high.\n\nThat tells me this is not Andrew's first experiment with illegal drugs or prescription drug abuse.  His experimentation is totally fearless, which indicates he has an addiction problem which could have started years ago.\n\nThe blood thinner he took is the least of that kid's problems.  It's time to start testing the boy's blood for all drugs on a regular basis.  He's got issues.", "\u201cHey sis, if you wanna talk legal, why don\u2019t I just call the police and report the theft of my daughter\u2019s medication by your son who admitted he wanted to get high. That admission strongly suggests that he\u2019s been high before and somehow you never noticed that your 12 year old son was doing drugs. I\u2019m sure CPS would be very interested in this as well.\u201d", "NTA-  I think this post is going to be a contentious one.  People don't operate in much grey area when it comes to kids, there's a lot of absolute thinking and nuance gets lost.  \n\nBut, IMO, the kid is 12, he stole and made a shitty decision. He's not four drinking drano that you left out, he's 12.  In the future I'd lock it up anything/everything now that you're more aware of what type of person he/your sister is.", "I'm 43 and I'm still jittery when I have to inject myself with 2mm baby needles. \n\nHow does a 12yo know how to inject a proper needle and has no fear/preoccupation about it? Maybe he's done it before? or seen someone do it at home?\n\nNTA - and your sister needs to talk to her kid.", "NTA - but your sister needs to know, she has a bigger problem than a hospital bill. Her son! He needs to be put in therapy straight away, to get to the bottom of why he wanted to 1. Get high & 2. Get attention.", "NTA. The blood thinners are a prescription. Tell your sister that you will have to file charges on your nephew for theft of prescription drugs because that's what he did. His emergency room records can be subpoenaed in a criminal case. You may want to go that route anyway. That boy needs help!! I don't know anyone who stole needles and meds at 12 to shoot up. Yikes!!", "NTA\n\nThe kid is clearly an idiot and so is your sister.  Anyone who can raise a kid who at the age of 12 that doesn't know they shouldn't be injecting themselves is a terrible parent.  \n\nHowever saying that if you are going to let morons like that into your house then please lock the medicine away somewhere safe.", "Sister and I interrogated all of the kids and we found out Andrew gave himself a high dose of the blood thinner because he thought it was her pain meds and he wanted to get high----\n\nOk her 12 year old kid wanted to get high and stole medicine to do this.  He used a needle to inject himself.  I think your sister has a bigger issue than the hospital bill", "NTA. No 12 year old takes medicine and injects themselves without knowing what they are doing is wrong. I also doubt it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s tried something he wasn\u2019t meant to.\n\nYour sister needs to take responsibility for leaving her delinquent child unsupervised, and focus on getting him the help he needs rather than threatening you with legal action. No legal action is going to fix her son.", "Notify hospital personnel (mandated reporter), police, and/or CPS about nephew's attempt to get high.", "NTA\n\nLet her sue, it was her 12 y/o son who did this, no judge is going to force you to pay especially as her AH child was trying to get high", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t imagine a kids first experiment with drugs being with needles. So I can\u2019t imagine this is the first time. I\u2019m not saying your sister is a bad parent because drug addiction can get to literally anyone, but you might want to consider involving the police or CPS because something is very wrong here. Maybe the kid found stuff online, maybe someone in his life is targeting him.", "NTA so your sister left without explaining to HER son what it was and the importance not to touch it. I am assuming you or your sister told him to put it back and not just left him holding the items. If you did I would switch to say YTA. I am really concerned that Andrew is looking for a high and is willing to steal for it. I would even dare to say he probably already has an addiction. It's not like Andrew is Allie's age or younger and found it laying out in the open. This was no accident.", "NTA\n\nYour nephew is injecting random medicines, he is (or is in way to be) a druggie. Your sister prefers to blame you rather than confront this fact", "NTA. Remind your sister if she goes the legal route, then cps will likely be called on her son. He stole medicine at 12 years old, and his mommy is blaming everyone else. Is cps involved? If not, why?", "NTA. As a teacher, I can guarantee that kid has had lessons in school about drugs and prescriptions. He knew what he was doing.\nIf she tries to sue, I would talk with an attorney about your options, including pressing charges for the stolen medication because it may be hard for you to get more.", "NTA.  Your sister is trying to place her blame onto you.", "NTA - her child stole medicine in order to get high. He assumed it was pain meds , so he thought about and executed a plan to get into it and take it . \n\nThis was not out of curiosity or an accident. He asked you what it was and you told him it\u2019s Alexis medication. He waited for the adults to be gone to take it. \n\nYour sister needs to reimburse the meds stolen and needs to pay attention to why her son decided to steal and consume drugs.", "NTA she has much bigger problems than a medical bill if her son is shooting up drugs to get high at 12. You don\u2019t owe her for medical bills.", "NTA and your sister is out of line! Is she willing to break up your entire family over a hospital bill that her son, whom she seems to have forgotten to educate about property, medication and common sense, caused all by himself? It's not like the needles and medicine were out on the counter for everyone to help themselves.", "NTA - The mother is going to end up making her children the type that don't take responsibility for their actions, because they see Mommy finding something else to blame. \n\nAnd people saying YTA for not having the medications locked up? I guess you need to lock up your kitchen knives, since they could cause harm if a kid grabs them. And turn the water off at the street, since a kid could drown. And the electricity as well, since a kid could get electrocuted or turn on a stove or oven.  All of which would/could be tragic. Her kids are old enough that you would think they wouldn't do stuff like this.\n\nRegarding paying the hospital bill/her threatening to sue: If she has Health insurance, and wants to be a %&$#, she may be able to contact them and tell them what happened, and then the insurance company could sue. \n\nNow, if she doesn't have Health Insurance, AND if you have Homeowners insurance, you could tell her to sue, since whatever she gets (up to a certain dollar amount) would be paid by your Homeowners insurance, except for the deductible. This way, the bill gets paid and your sister isn't in debt for it...", "NTA  \nSOunds like Sis is pissed 'cause sje just found out her spawn is a stoner.", "NTA - I\u2019d say let her sue; she\u2019s going to have to explain to a lot of people why her 12 year old is stealing medicines in an effort to get high. Hope she likes protective-services, because she\u2019s going to get to know them pretty well..", "NTA it takes a special kind of energy for a 12 year old to go as far as inject himself", "NTA- 12 is old enough to understand- he did understand to a degree because he did it on purpose in the hopes of getting high. WTF.  \nAlso, if they go somewhere and there is alcohol that is accessible (as in not in a locked up cabinet), will she sue everyone that 'let' her child get drunk if he chose to sneak some.  \n\n\nHe knew what he was doing and he knew he shouldn't have been doing it.", "NTA, and the threat to sue you, by the parent of the person who stole your daughter\u2019s prescribed medication while seeking to get high, is beyond inappropriate.\n\n1. The hospital personnel where he was treated after injecting the stolen medication are mandated reporters if you\u2019re in the US. It was the boy\u2019s mother, not the victims of his theft of prescribed medication from their home, who was responsible for supervising him (and far better aware than you of whether he could be trusted not to steal your daughter\u2019s medicine when she also chose to leave the house and walk the dogs). It would be very surprising if his hospital visit hasn\u2019t yielded an ongoing child protective services investigation (into his parental supervision, not the victims of his drug theft). \n\n2. Regardless of the age of the known culprit, you (and your sister, and all the others present)  are percipient witnesses to criminal conduct. In every US jurisdiction, there are criminal statutes proscribing various forms of attempting to influence potential witnesses, including but not limited to threats to financially harm a witness or dissuade a witness from making a report to law enforcement of a criminal act. Your sister and you are also witnesses to whatever admissions were made to you and led to the hospital visit, where they almost certainly were recorded by mandatory reporters.\n\nEven putting aside how wildly unhelpful to her son\u2014who has admitted to adults including his guardian that he stole drugs and injected them seeking to get high\u2014-it is to want you to pay the bills for the medical consequences of his theft, his mother is threatening to sue a person who will be a witness in both any criminal investigation and any CPS investigation. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to envision a less helpful parental response to a drug-seeking 12 year-old than a threat to sue you. \n\nThe only caveat I have as to your role involves a question you haven\u2019t asked. Please reconsider the wisdom of adults recording and celebrating as \u201chilarious\u201d either a minor\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s reaction to prescribed painkillers.", "NTA, the kid is 12 and old enough to know that you shouldn\u2019t mess with other people\u2019s medications.

He\u2019s old enough to inject himself with medication but that\u2019s your fault? Yikes.", "NTA\n\nAt 12 he should know better. She should be more concerned that he wanted to take pain medication to get high.", "NTA. And I hate to say this, but I don't think this is Andrew's first time at this rodeo.", "NTA\n\nTaking someone else's medicine is a move I'd expect a 4 or 5 year old to do. Not a 12 year old.", "Your sister has a much bigger problem than a hospital bill.  Her 12 year old stole medication and injected himself with it because he wanted to get high.  Not even pills, he literally stabbed himself with a needle while seeking a high.  This is deeply concerning behaviour and she should be focussing on that.\n\nBut also NTA, a normal 12 year old would not have done this and you shouldn't need to be concerned about a child that age taking medication that isn't theirs.", "NTA. And Jesus Christ this is terrifying. I am so sorry you\u2019re going through this, but if I were you I would think beyond Reddit at this point and get legal advice. She is fucking up trying to pass the blame, but there\u2019s been many fuckups who get paid passing the blame\u2026. This is the kind of shit that ruins families and I am sorry she doesn\u2019t understand her complicity will do that.

Him wanting to get high at his age and verbally saying so is something that needs addressed immediately.

I don\u2019t know any kid who voluntarily gets a shot. Her son knows how to use a needle and is taking other people\u2019s meds to get high.

Is your sister at all concerned that her 12-year-old is fearless enough in his drug experimentation to go into someone's home, steal drugs, and inject (not pop a pill, snort, or smoke, inject) himself with something without even knowing what it was? It sounds like Andrew already has a substance use problem and should be getting help for that. \n\n>She\u2019s threatening to sue and I really don\u2019t want to go the legal route with this.\n\nThat's a recipe for disaster.

We\u2019ve been in and out of the hospital for months. \n\nSomething important to know is that Alexis has a picc line (big take home iv) and is getting blood thinner injections every day so we do have needles and vials around the house. She also occasionally gets pain meds through her picc line. \n\nMy sister has 2 kids, Andrew (12) and Alyssa (9). She brought them to the house to play with my kids not too long ago. \n\nAlexis had a minor procedure a couple days before they came. I was showing my sister a video of Alexis at the house right after the procedure. She was still very high and it was hilarious (she\u2019s fine with me showing family these videos). Andrew came into the kitchen, heard the video, and asked what it was. I said that I was just showing his mom a video of alexis after she got some pain meds. \n\nA few hours later the kids were grabbing a snack and Andrew took the container with needles and vials of the blood thinner out of the pantry. He asked what it is and I said it\u2019s Alexis\u2019s medicine. \n\nMy sister and I left to take our dogs for a walk and I wanted to get a snack out of the pantry when we came back.

That's a lot!   \n\n\nThat being said, this is both pretty normal and also something his Mom should be addressing as serious - not blaming someone else like he's a three year old, but addressing. 12 is old enough to get consequences for stealing, and to have a real talk about safety with medications and safety if he decides to use recreationally again.", "Big time NTA. \n\nAndrew clearly has a drug problem.

What made him so sure he used it right? Or did he just stabe his arm with it and that's that? There is no way a 12yo will have enough courage to do that without ever seeing something similar before, no matter how stupid he is.\n\nYou know, as a kid I used to go through my grandma's drawers everytime we visited, I found her heart medicine once and the pills looked like candy so I ate one, I didn't even know that pills are supposed to be just swallowed and I actually shewed on it, that's when I discovered that it was bitter from the inside, my parents only found out when I went into the living room and told them that the candy may be bad cause it didn't taste so good, and I was rushed to the hospital.\n\nBut I was 5! It was a pill that looked like candy!\n\nNow THAT, is something I can totally understand happening, but a 12yo having no problem stabing himself with a needle? And he WANTS TO GET HIGH?

I suppose you could argue that he was going to do so anyways and was just waiting for the adults to leave, but he also admitted to wanting to get high and injecting the medication with that intent. He could have used a saline flush, but if he did so because he thought it would get him high then that\u2019s all that matters. Stupidity or not.\n\nIt\u2019s also cause for concern that he would just inject himself without even knowing what the medication is or what can happen to him. That\u2019s incredibly alarming.

Almost all 12 year olds these days are perfectly capable if looking up how to do anything on YouTube or TikTok. \n\nThey also have probably seen meds or narcotics injected many times on screen while watching TV and films, and yes, probably many of them will have watched shows and films with age ratings that are 15+ or 18+ (or your country's equivalent) - but how many of us didn't do the same growing up?\n\nPersonally, I have always applied a 'minus 2 years' policy to age ratings with my kids, with some case by case exceptions in both directions, so they were able to watch 15 rated films from around 13 onwards, for example. \n\nBut we always discussed the first few, as they learnt what they could handle in terms of dark/horror themes and took my advice regarding when to wait until they were older.\n\nThey have simultaneously mature and immature brains, due to their specific stage of development, caught between childhood and young adulthood. They are desperate to leave childhood and try out the exciting new things that **they** think are part of being 'a grown-up'. These are absolutely not the same things that we adults with some experience in the world, whether parents or not, know are needed to be a grown-up, a fully fledged, independent adult.\n\nMost kids that age aren't excited about retirement funds or saving a deposit for a mortgage, they're excited about being old enough to drive and not have to follow Mum and Dad's rules, to go partying on the weekend with their friends - even most kids who study hard still want to have some party time.  \n\nEven the most well behaved kids will still look forward to being independent, no matter how much they love their parents and will still miss them when they eventually leave home.\n\nGetting back to OP's nephew, 12 is such a volatile age, a time  when kids are in flux, a time of massive transition. \n\nKids often go to new schools around somewhere between 10 - 12 in many countries, leaving behind the comfort of their small, local childhood schools with the kind teachers and moving up to often larger secondary schools with much older kids, who are drawn from a wider area. This can mean meeting kids from a much more varied social and cultural backgrounds than before, leading to some clashes in behaviours. Sadly, of course, there will always be some kids who end up bullying other kids.\n\nThis kid has probably seen meds or drugs injected on TV, in medical dramas, or in films, or in video games even, in fact, that's a very likely source, as many games use injectable meds such as 'stimpaks' to restore health points. Many parents also completely ignore the PEGI ratings on the video games that their kids play!\n\nHis brain is mature enough to want to chase what he sees as the exciting, good feelings that he sees portrayed on screen or IRL when people get drunk or high, or when his friends might joke around about getting a buzz off something they shouldn't, like we used with Tippex thinners in the 80s in.school - for us,it was only ever a joke but they were eventually banned because some kids did take it further!\n\nAnd research shows that many of those kids that took it further in some way, that were either good kids at heart but very impulsive and easily influenced and/or kids who sought out highs as a way to self-medicate, many of them had very real, actual mental health issues and/or neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nThere is a significant number of kids with ADHD who seek out some form of self-medication to calm their constantly agitated brains, often described as feeling like 'my head is full of bees!', and due to impulsivity being a very common ADHD trait that leads to poor decision making, they end up using alcohol or illegal drugs.\n\nThe hormonal changes brought on by puberty can often increase ADHD symptoms and it's also seen as normal for pre-teen and teens to be a bit more impulsive anyway, particularly boys. \n\nI think that the nephew has made a very stupid, very poor decision. It doesn't necessarily mean that he's a bad kid but he should absolutely be evaluated by a child psychiatrist.\n\nHis internet, gaming, and TV use should be monitored and supervised but not removed. There probably needs to be a much more interactive, shared use of screens amongst his family. \n\nHis parents should play some games with him to understand them and ensure that they are appropriate and if they do want to forbid certain games, discuss why with him and allow him to express why he enjoys playing those games, and listen and take time to consider his views and find a way to work with him. Until he's, say 15, he can only play PEGI 16 PvP games with his Dad or older sibling (if there is one and they are willing!), or there are certain games that have play modes that reduce the blood/gore shown and he must use those, for example.\n\nHe most likely needs more one to one time spent with him with his Dad, no matter what.\n\nFind out what he's becoming interested in as a growing young man, not a little kid and also not what his parents, particularly his dad, thinks he **should** be interested in.\n\nHis parents need to make sure that he has a decent group of friends around him, near where they live, at school and online - these may all be the same kids but not always.\n\nThe parents shouldn't immediately rush to blame his friends either! Even if one seems a bit, or even very, rough around the edges. Things aren't always what they seem in friend groups and even if they are ultimately the source of the problem, it may be more complex than it appears and rushing in may just further alienate them from their kid. \n\nAs much as is possible and within safe limits, work with a therapist and give the kid the tools to resolve the problems within their friendship group themselves.

What I did at age 12 was out of pure curiosity and not because I was drug seeking or depressed and wanting to hurt myself. I\u2019m not saying this is necessarily the case with Andrew, but I think to accuse him of being drug seeking or an addict without further discussion may be inaccurate.\n\nEDIT: Either way, a major discussion needs to be had with Andrew and he needs to understand the gravity of what he did.

Now, say that wasn\u2019t the case - say I kept the gun and ammo together and out in the open, and my 12yo nephew takes the gun and shoots himself even though he knows better. Because I improperly stored the gun and ammo (the medication and syringe), I\u2019m still ABSOLUTELY at fault and there\u2019s no way y\u2019all would say otherwise. As an adult, it\u2019s your responsibility to safe guard kids in your house from things that could hurt them, even if they know better. In this case, just stop being so dense and store the medication and syringes in two different locations with the syringes being somewhere a kid can\u2019t get to\u2026it\u2019s not that hard, and it is your responsibility.\n\nAs for that kid\u2019s intentions\u2026good luck to the mom with that one.", "YTA all medicines must be kept out of reach of children in childproof storage specially because of situations like this. In fact I'm sure the medicine package says exactly that. Keep out of reach of children.

She is for asking you to pay, she\u2019s the mom and should be responsible for any bills, but you are as well. As soon as he expressed curiosity about the medications (even before then honestly) you should have made sure they were locked up. Many local substance abuse prevention coalitions give away free medication lock boxes.

Cannot believe some of these comments LOL. Yes your other children know better but I\u2019m sure it has also been drilled into them since they live with a sibling who has some kind of medical needs or chronic illness. Some 12 year olds DONT know better, and what message does a 12 year old receive when his mom and aunt are laughing at a video of his cousin \u201chigh\u201d after surgery? Concerning behaviour that his mom needs to address for sure, but both of you need to take some responsibility. Also, to be clear, YOU are responsible for keeping your daughters medication out of reach of children in the home. There is no gray area around that. As soon as he pulled it out before you two left on your walk, that should have been an indicator it needed to be hidden or locked away so none of the kids could access it.

The mom has much bigger problems than the hospital bill.\n\nWhen I was a kid his age I was deeply depressed due to my living situation, family life, etc. I snuck alcohol and smoked weed. Any mind altering substance I could get my hands on I would take. My mom had MS so she had pain meds and I was sneaking them by 13yo to get high and escape reality- her nephew seems to be heading down a similar path. This boy needs help.\n\nNot to reach too far, but if the boys anything like me he\u2019ll be snorting heroin/fentanyl by 18 like I was and be a full blown addict by 19.

If he\u2019s happily injecting unknown drugs, he\u2019s done other stuff.", "Im inclined to think this is incredibly fake given that most 12 year olds aren't going to do IV drugs for a kick.", "This was my reaction, too. That kid absolutely knew what he was doing, and this was not his first rodeo.", "I think you\u2019re taking a leap there. My guess is that the kid saw the adults laughing about the daughter being  high & he probably wanted attention so tried to do the same thing", "This, it's unlikely a 12yo is putting a needle in without having seen it done. My guess is he just squirted it out and wasted it messing around with it. Then just bullshitted about taking it or couldn't give a straight answer. The hospital would have kept him in for observation just in case.he actually did take it.", "This isnt a case where the kid took the medicine thinking it would help him or by mistake. He was literally teying to get high by stealing someone else's medicine. This isnt even debatable IMO.", "OP should never invite any of them back in the home for any reason.", "Also, a lot of times if you don\u2019t want have to self pay for the the medicine to be replaced, there has to be a good reason and if it\u2019s been stolen the doctor, pharm or insurance will want a police report. She should tell her sister that and say \u201csorry, doesn\u2019t look like I have a choice\u201d. Wonder what she\u2019ll say then?", "Yes.. best case scenario, he saw the daughter get attention for the video, and wanted to get the same attention so bad that he was willing to go through the pain of a needle just to get it. Worse, he\u2019s imitating someone at home. Nightmare scenario, he\u2019s been there done that and is an already addict himself.\n\nIn all cases sounds like his mum won\u2019t give a crap about it, cuz her biggest concern is how to get some extra cash out of her own sister with 4 kids including one with a medical bills.

With all the kids being 9 or older without neurological/mental issues it\u2019s not at all unreasonable to expect them to stay out of trouble for 30 minutes with the adults nearby.

I used to give myself vitamin B injections (prescription) because my insurance paid for those 100%, but if I wanted the inhaler it was $400 per month. It's a pretty thick liquid, so was more difficult with the insulin needles than with the larger ones, but it was still fairly easily doable without help.
