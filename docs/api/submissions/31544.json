Alexis has a lot of health issues. We\u2019ve been in and out of the hospital for months. \n\nSomething important to know is that Alexis has a picc line (big take home iv) and is getting blood thinner injections every day so we do have needles and vials around the house. She also occasionally gets pain meds through her picc line. \n\nMy sister has 2 kids, Andrew (12) and Alyssa (9). She brought them to the house to play with my kids not too long ago. \n\nAlexis had a minor procedure a couple days before they came. I was showing my sister a video of Alexis at the house right after the procedure. She was still very high and it was hilarious (she\u2019s fine with me showing family these videos). Andrew came into the kitchen, heard the video, and asked what it was. I said that I was just showing his mom a video of alexis after she got some pain meds. \n\nA few hours later the kids were grabbing a snack and Andrew took the container with needles and vials of the blood thinner out of the pantry. He asked what it is and I said it\u2019s Alexis\u2019s medicine. \n\nMy sister and I left to take our dogs for a walk and I wanted to get a snack out of the pantry when we came back. I noticed Alexis\u2019s medicine box was moved so I looked at it and one of the blood thinner vials was a lot more empty than before and a needle/syringe was missing. \n\nSister and I interrogated all of the kids and we found out Andrew gave himself a high dose of the blood thinner because he thought it was her pain meds and he wanted to get high. \n\nMy sister rushed Andrew to the hospital and he stayed overnight. Now she\u2019s sending me the hospital bill because I was the one that left the medicine where he could get it. I\u2019m refusing to pay because if my 11 and 12 year old boys and 8 year old girl know not to touch other peoples medicines, her 12 year old should be able to see a vial and syringe and not drug himself. \n\nShe\u2019s threatening to sue and I really don\u2019t want to go the legal route with this.

He stole your child's medication with the intent to get high. He's old enough to know better than to steal someone's medication and your sister needs to get in front of this quickly before she ends up with an addict on her hands.", "NTA. Your nephew did something extremely foolish, and he should have known better. He\u2019s not  toddler playing with sharp objects left laying around. \n\nHe\u2019s a 12 year old budding addict. Your sister has a lot more to be concerned with than hospital bills. Also blaming you is missing the point\u2014her son has problems.", "Her 12 year old wants to get high?!?! And she\u2019s mad at YOU?! What in the holy Heights of deflection!

Your sister has a huge problem and it has nothing to do with a 12 year old who doesn't know not to touch other people's medicine.  No, it's worse than that.  Andrew knew what he was doing was wrong, but was motivated to do it anyway, to get high.\n\nThat tells me this is not Andrew's first experiment with illegal drugs or prescription drug abuse.  His experimentation is totally fearless, which indicates he has an addiction problem which could have started years ago.\n\nThe blood thinner he took is the least of that kid's problems.  It's time to start testing the boy's blood for all drugs on a regular basis.  He's got issues.", "\u201cHey sis, if you wanna talk legal, why don\u2019t I just call the police and report the theft of my daughter\u2019s medication by your son who admitted he wanted to get high. That admission strongly suggests that he\u2019s been high before and somehow you never noticed that your 12 year old son was doing drugs. I\u2019m sure CPS would be very interested in this as well.\u201d", "NTA-  I think this post is going to be a contentious one.  People don't operate in much grey area when it comes to kids, there's a lot of absolute thinking and nuance gets lost.  \n\nBut, IMO, the kid is 12, he stole and made a shitty decision. He's not four drinking drano that you left out, he's 12.  In the future I'd lock it up anything/everything now that you're more aware of what type of person he/your sister is.", "I'm 43 and I'm still jittery when I have to inject myself with 2mm baby needles. \n\nHow does a 12yo know how to inject a proper needle and has no fear/preoccupation about it? Maybe he's done it before? or seen someone do it at home?\n\nNTA - and your sister needs to talk to her kid.", "NTA - but your sister needs to know, she has a bigger problem than a hospital bill. Her son! He needs to be put in therapy straight away, to get to the bottom of why he wanted to 1. Get high & 2. Get attention.", "NTA. The blood thinners are a prescription. Tell your sister that you will have to file charges on your nephew for theft of prescription drugs because that's what he did. His emergency room records can be subpoenaed in a criminal case. You may want to go that route anyway. That boy needs help!! I don't know anyone who stole needles and meds at 12 to shoot up. Yikes!!", "NTA\n\nThe kid is clearly an idiot and so is your sister.  Anyone who can raise a kid who at the age of 12 that doesn't know they shouldn't be injecting themselves is a terrible parent.  \n\nHowever saying that if you are going to let morons like that into your house then please lock the medicine away somewhere safe.", "Sister and I interrogated all of the kids and we found out Andrew gave himself a high dose of the blood thinner because he thought it was her pain meds and he wanted to get high----\n\nOk her 12 year old kid wanted to get high and stole medicine to do this.  He used a needle to inject himself.  I think your sister has a bigger issue than the hospital bill", "NTA. No 12 year old takes medicine and injects themselves without knowing what they are doing is wrong. I also doubt it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s tried something he wasn\u2019t meant to.\n\nYour sister needs to take responsibility for leaving her delinquent child unsupervised, and focus on getting him the help he needs rather than threatening you with legal action. No legal action is going to fix her son.", "Notify hospital personnel (mandated reporter), police, and/or CPS about nephew's attempt to get high.", "NTA\n\nLet her sue, it was her 12 y/o son who did this, no judge is going to force you to pay especially as her AH child was trying to get high", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t imagine a kids first experiment with drugs being with needles. So I can\u2019t imagine this is the first time. I\u2019m not saying your sister is a bad parent because drug addiction can get to literally anyone, but you might want to consider involving the police or CPS because something is very wrong here. Maybe the kid found stuff online, maybe someone in his life is targeting him.", "NTA so your sister left without explaining to HER son what it was and the importance not to touch it. I am assuming you or your sister told him to put it back and not just left him holding the items. If you did I would switch to say YTA. I am really concerned that Andrew is looking for a high and is willing to steal for it. I would even dare to say he probably already has an addiction. It's not like Andrew is Allie's age or younger and found it laying out in the open. This was no accident.", "NTA\n\nYour nephew is injecting random medicines, he is (or is in way to be) a druggie. Your sister prefers to blame you rather than confront this fact", "NTA. Remind your sister if she goes the legal route, then cps will likely be called on her son. He stole medicine at 12 years old, and his mommy is blaming everyone else. Is cps involved? If not, why?", "NTA. As a teacher, I can guarantee that kid has had lessons in school about drugs and prescriptions. He knew what he was doing.\nIf she tries to sue, I would talk with an attorney about your options, including pressing charges for the stolen medication because it may be hard for you to get more.", "NTA.  Your sister is trying to place her blame onto you.", "NTA - her child stole medicine in order to get high. He assumed it was pain meds , so he thought about and executed a plan to get into it and take it . \n\nThis was not out of curiosity or an accident. He asked you what it was and you told him it\u2019s Alexis medication. He waited for the adults to be gone to take it. \n\nYour sister needs to reimburse the meds stolen and needs to pay attention to why her son decided to steal and consume drugs.", "NTA she has much bigger problems than a medical bill if her son is shooting up drugs to get high at 12. You don\u2019t owe her for medical bills.", "NTA and your sister is out of line! Is she willing to break up your entire family over a hospital bill that her son, whom she seems to have forgotten to educate about property, medication and common sense, caused all by himself? It's not like the needles and medicine were out on the counter for everyone to help themselves.", "NTA - The mother is going to end up making her children the type that don't take responsibility for their actions, because they see Mommy finding something else to blame. \n\nAnd people saying YTA for not having the medications locked up? I guess you need to lock up your kitchen knives, since they could cause harm if a kid grabs them. And turn the water off at the street, since a kid could drown. And the electricity as well, since a kid could get electrocuted or turn on a stove or oven.  All of which would/could be tragic. Her kids are old enough that you would think they wouldn't do stuff like this.\n\nRegarding paying the hospital bill/her threatening to sue: If she has Health insurance, and wants to be a %&$#, she may be able to contact them and tell them what happened, and then the insurance company could sue. \n\nNow, if she doesn't have Health Insurance, AND if you have Homeowners insurance, you could tell her to sue, since whatever she gets (up to a certain dollar amount) would be paid by your Homeowners insurance, except for the deductible. This way, the bill gets paid and your sister isn't in debt for it...", "NTA  \nSOunds like Sis is pissed 'cause sje just found out her spawn is a stoner.", "NTA - I\u2019d say let her sue; she\u2019s going to have to explain to a lot of people why her 12 year old is stealing medicines in an effort to get high. Hope she likes protective-services, because she\u2019s going to get to know them pretty well..", "NTA it takes a special kind of energy for a 12 year old to go as far as inject himself", "NTA- 12 is old enough to understand- he did understand to a degree because he did it on purpose in the hopes of getting high. WTF.  \nAlso, if they go somewhere and there is alcohol that is accessible (as in not in a locked up cabinet), will she sue everyone that 'let' her child get drunk if he chose to sneak some.  \n\n\nHe knew what he was doing and he knew he shouldn't have been doing it.", "NTA, and the threat to sue you, by the parent of the person who stole your daughter\u2019s prescribed medication while seeking to get high, is beyond inappropriate.\n\n1. The hospital personnel where he was treated after injecting the stolen medication are mandated reporters if you\u2019re in the US. It was the boy\u2019s mother, not the victims of his theft of prescribed medication from their home, who was responsible for supervising him (and far better aware than you of whether he could be trusted not to steal your daughter\u2019s medicine when she also chose to leave the house and walk the dogs). It would be very surprising if his hospital visit hasn\u2019t yielded an ongoing child protective services investigation (into his parental supervision, not the victims of his drug theft). \n\n2. Regardless of the age of the known culprit, you (and your sister, and all the others present)  are percipient witnesses to criminal conduct. In every US jurisdiction, there are criminal statutes proscribing various forms of attempting to influence potential witnesses, including but not limited to threats to financially harm a witness or dissuade a witness from making a report to law enforcement of a criminal act. Your sister and you are also witnesses to whatever admissions were made to you and led to the hospital visit, where they almost certainly were recorded by mandatory reporters.\n\nEven putting aside how wildly unhelpful to her son\u2014who has admitted to adults including his guardian that he stole drugs and injected them seeking to get high\u2014-it is to want you to pay the bills for the medical consequences of his theft, his mother is threatening to sue a person who will be a witness in both any criminal investigation and any CPS investigation. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to envision a less helpful parental response to a drug-seeking 12 year-old than a threat to sue you. \n\nThe only caveat I have as to your role involves a question you haven\u2019t asked. Please reconsider the wisdom of adults recording and celebrating as \u201chilarious\u201d either a minor\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s reaction to prescribed painkillers.", "NTA, the kid is 12 and old enough to know that you shouldn\u2019t mess with other people\u2019s medications. If anything, this is on your sister for not making it clear enough to her own children that you never do anything like that. Ever.", "Let her sue- then counter sue for theft and emotional stress. He\u2019s old enough to inject himself with medication but that\u2019s your fault? Yikes.", "NTA\n\nAt 12 he should know better. She should be more concerned that he wanted to take pain medication to get high.", "NTA. And I hate to say this, but I don't think this is Andrew's first time at this rodeo.", "NTA\n\nTaking someone else's medicine is a move I'd expect a 4 or 5 year old to do. Not a 12 year old.", "Your sister has a much bigger problem than a hospital bill.  Her 12 year old stole medication and injected himself with it because he wanted to get high.  Not even pills, he literally stabbed himself with a needle while seeking a high.  This is deeply concerning behaviour and she should be focussing on that.\n\nBut also NTA, a normal 12 year old would not have done this and you shouldn't need to be concerned about a child that age taking medication that isn't theirs.", "NTA. And Jesus Christ this is terrifying. I am so sorry you\u2019re going through this, but if I were you I would think beyond Reddit at this point and get legal advice. She is fucking up trying to pass the blame, but there\u2019s been many fuckups who get paid passing the blame\u2026. This is the kind of shit that ruins families and I am sorry she doesn\u2019t understand her complicity will do that. There\u2019s NO other way to get that message across and this is only the beginning of the kid is 12\u2026. I legit think that you need to go to Al-Anon.", "NTA\n\nThis is your sisters wake up call. How many parents said \u201cI wish I knew sooner\u2026\u201d here\u2019s her sooner. Hes at an age where they can control his environment and get him help.

He ADMITTED he thought it was your daughter\u2019s pain medication! It might be your best bet to contact the police and CPS. Him wanting to get high at his age and verbally saying so is something that needs addressed immediately. This\u2019ll probably make your family upset with you, but you are being proactive about your nephew not turning into a drug addict later in life. I doubt this is the first time he\u2019s stolen medication for this reason.", "NTA. Your sister is being totally irrational.", "He said that he purposely grabbed it to get high. I don\u2019t know any kid who voluntarily gets a shot. Her son knows how to use a needle and is taking other people\u2019s meds to get high.

Wow, your sister is threatening to sue you?? She won't win if she does, but she will lose you as a sister, that's for sure.", "NTA. Her son had the intent to get high. There was no mistake in what he did. He sneakily edited until you BOTH went to walk the dogs. Your sister chose to leave her child alone after this child showed interest in the drugs.

Is your sister at all concerned that her 12-year-old is fearless enough in his drug experimentation to go into someone's home, steal drugs, and inject (not pop a pill, snort, or smoke, inject) himself with something without even knowing what it was? It sounds like Andrew already has a substance use problem and should be getting help for that. \n\n>She\u2019s threatening to sue and I really don\u2019t want to go the legal route with this.\n\nThat's a recipe for disaster. Lawsuits are not just costly but intrusive and she will have strangers asking her what drugs she keeps in her home, if her son has a drug problem, has he stolen drugs before, and if she did anything when she found out her son was trying to get high.", "NTA. This isn't an 'attractive nuisance' situation, like having a trampoline in your backyard. This is more like having a liquor cabinet.\n\nIf your nephew had downed half a handle of whiskey while you walked the dog, he would have had much the same outcome (an overnight hospital stay) and your sister would have a tough time justifying blaming you.

We\u2019ve been in and out of the hospital for months. \n\nSomething important to know is that Alexis has a picc line (big take home iv) and is getting blood thinner injections every day so we do have needles and vials around the house. She also occasionally gets pain meds through her picc line. \n\nMy sister has 2 kids, Andrew (12) and Alyssa (9). She brought them to the house to play with my kids not too long ago. \n\nAlexis had a minor procedure a couple days before they came. I was showing my sister a video of Alexis at the house right after the procedure. She was still very high and it was hilarious (she\u2019s fine with me showing family these videos). Andrew came into the kitchen, heard the video, and asked what it was. I said that I was just showing his mom a video of alexis after she got some pain meds. \n\nA few hours later the kids were grabbing a snack and Andrew took the container with needles and vials of the blood thinner out of the pantry. He asked what it is and I said it\u2019s Alexis\u2019s medicine. \n\nMy sister and I left to take our dogs for a walk and I wanted to get a snack out of the pantry when we came back.

That's a lot!   \n\n\nThat being said, this is both pretty normal and also something his Mom should be addressing as serious - not blaming someone else like he's a three year old, but addressing. 12 is old enough to get consequences for stealing, and to have a real talk about safety with medications and safety if he decides to use recreationally again.", "Big time NTA. \n\nAndrew clearly has a drug problem.

What made him so sure he used it right? Or did he just stabe his arm with it and that's that? There is no way a 12yo will have enough courage to do that without ever seeing something similar before, no matter how stupid he is.\n\nYou know, as a kid I used to go through my grandma's drawers everytime we visited, I found her heart medicine once and the pills looked like candy so I ate one, I didn't even know that pills are supposed to be just swallowed and I actually shewed on it, that's when I discovered that it was bitter from the inside, my parents only found out when I went into the living room and told them that the candy may be bad cause it didn't taste so good, and I was rushed to the hospital.\n\nBut I was 5! It was a pill that looked like candy!\n\nNow THAT, is something I can totally understand happening, but a 12yo having no problem stabing himself with a needle? And he WANTS TO GET HIGH?

I suppose you could argue that he was going to do so anyways and was just waiting for the adults to leave, but he also admitted to wanting to get high and injecting the medication with that intent. He could have used a saline flush, but if he did so because he thought it would get him high then that\u2019s all that matters. Stupidity or not.\n\nIt\u2019s also cause for concern that he would just inject himself without even knowing what the medication is or what can happen to him. That\u2019s incredibly alarming.
