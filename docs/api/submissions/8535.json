No. You were under no obligation to go out of your way. And if no one was going to go out of there way that would mean someone was going to benefit from the sale.

It was an old video game being sold for the same price as all the other old video games for that system.  My husband brought it and a few other games up to the front and said he was interested, but explained what that particular item actually was and offered a higher price.  The seller was pleased, but said he really didn't know anything about the specific games and had not bothered to learn anything beyond what a typical price for common games for the system were, and wanted to clear the shop space anyway.  So he cheerfully sold it to my husband at the originally listed price rather than my husband's offer.  He said it was his responsibility to know, and congratulated my husband on the great find for his collection.  \n\nThe game was correctly labeled and worked just fine.\n\nIt's clear that whoever sold it to the store in the first place had also not realized what it was, since there's no way the guy was actually taking a loss on it.\n\nBut yeah.  My husband had no obligation to do what he did.  Some would argue that he should not have done so - and they're probably not wrong.\n\nYou are *not* responsible for her lack of research.
