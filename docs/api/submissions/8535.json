It is not your fault that the seller did not know their onions.", "NTA, the seller could have done more research on the purse, but they chose not to, that's not your fault!", "NTA. Not your job to educate other sellers. I wonder why they thought it was fake?

Doesn't seem like she paid for it herself  in the first instance either.\n\nThe only time I would say ethics come into situations like this is if items like this are found in a charity shop way underpriced and you know that before buying.", "NTA.

You got a good deal and profited from it. Nothing wrong with that.", "Probably downvoted for this but while your technically NTA, especially since they are harassing you, we\u2019re talking about knowingly taking advantage of someone for likely hundreds of dollars. \n\nThey didn\u2019t state that the authenticity was unknown. They stated that it was fake and you bought it knowing differently.\n\nDid you have to point out how you knew it was real or that they should check it\u2019s authenticity? No. You were under no obligation to go out of your way. And if no one was going to go out of there way that would mean someone was going to benefit from the sale. Why not you?\n\nI can agree that you didn\u2019t technically do anything wrong. And perhaps you\u2019re not in a position where you can afford to lose what is essentially free money. \n\nWith all that said, while your choice wasn\u2019t wrong I also don\u2019t think it was very kind.
