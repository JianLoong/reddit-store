My set was much nicer and she loved it so we got rid of her old dresser during the move. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 4 years now and my husband and I have a 2 year old daughter and are expecting another girl in February. We have been co-sleeping with our daughter since she was born and she has shared our room, but now we need to move her into her own room. I have always wanted my children to have my old things from my childhood and that included the dresser set. When we gave my stepdaughter the dresser I had made it clear to my husband that once we had children OUR children would be using it since it is mine. He agreed and still agrees with me so we decided to discuss it with my stepdaughter. \n\nShe was upset that we were taking it away, we tried to ask her to downsize her things so that she can store her clothes in the closet but she refused saying we should just buy a new dresser for our daughter. So after she left we decided to leave her clothes on her bed and take the dresser out ourselves. After she came back the next weekend she waited until we left the house and moved the dresser back into her room. My husband had another discussion with her and we let her know that was unacceptable. \n\nNow her mother is involved and is calling us telling us we are being unreasonable and should just buy and new set. The thing is my husband and I have also decided to stop buying new clothes for my stepdaughter as we already send her mother child support and we need both the money and space. Once she grows out of her clothes she will not need a dresser so there is no point in buying a new one when we need to save money. \n\nTLDR: I am taking back my dresser that I gave to her a few years ago so that my daughter can have it and she is refusing to let us have it back\n\nUpdate: my stepdaughter is 13 and no we did not tell her beforehand that it was a loan but it was expected of her to give it back if we asked as we are the adults and the parents\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to ask her to bring clothes from her mothers as she only visits every other weekend", "created_utc": 1668714534, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxzmyy/aita_for_taking_back_my_dresser_from_my/", "score": 1361, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The irony is, you probably could have sold her on buying her a NEW set for her birthday or Christmas,saying she was so grown up that she deserved a new set and the baby should have the old used one. See, that would have made her feel important..instead you decide to take a shit on her. Not spending money on her because of your new baby. Are your trying to be the evil step mom?

You have a chance to do the right thing, and I hope you\u2019ll take it. Even if you refuse to see her as your kid, she is still your husbands kid and still needs clothing and furniture.

Or are you just changing your mind now that you have birthed children? Also, your step daughter ***is*** your daughter, so your child ***does*** have the set. Buy a new set for your other daughters. And for heavens sake, continue buying necessary clothes for your step daughter! The way you are talking, you are creating a huge divide in the family.", "YTA. You need to buy your daughter clothes regardless of whether your husband pays child support or not, that is a basic necessity. You should replace the dresser as well.

If you knew you wanted your old dresser to go to your bio kids, you should have never gotten rid of your stepdaughter\u2019s old dresser.  That was a real WTF choice there.  Your intransigence on this issue is bizarre and unkind.  Go shopping with the stepdaughter so she has a decent place to keep her clothes.

You decided to be even more awful by removing it while she was away because you knew how upset she got about you taking her dresser from her. You're using her genetic makeup as an excuse for a crappy decision. I don't see anywhere where you said you've told her throughout the years of the dresser is simply on loan to her.

This would have been a perfect opportunity, if the dresser really meant that much to you, that you could have either gone out and bought a new one for her, or picked one out for her new sibling, together, to make her feel involved. \n\nThis is a massive middle finger that you have done to the poor kid and her mother is completely in the right to have stepped in and to have attempted to open your eyes to the big - and scaring, thing that you have done.", "Should have just gone the whole hog and thrown her out her room as well YTA", "What kind of heartless monsters are you and your husband?

So is your husband for supporting this bs.  Then to double down and say you\u2019re not going to be providing clothing anymore (not acceptable) makes you downright evil.

When you give someone something you relinquish all rights to it, but then here you come talking about \"when we gave my stepdaughter the dresser I made it clear to my husband that once we had children OUR children would be using it since it is MINE.\" Way to be a literal overgrown child giving your stepdaughter who doesn't even have a dresser in your home and taking it back to give to your 2 year old daughter who doesn't even have half the amount of clothes that your stepdaughter has and that's not even talking about the size difference of those clothes either. You told your stepdaughter to store her clothes in the closet after she's already adjusted to having a dresser in her bedroom. And what the actual fuck are you talking about with this \"we decided to stop buying new clothes for my stepdaughter because we already send her mother child support and we need both the money and space.\" Just because your HUSBAND sends your stepdaughter's MOTHER money for child support does not mean he is supposed to stop caring for his daughter monetarily.

You should be showing her the same love you would your own child. I am thankful that my girlfriends step father is better than this or else I would hate seeing her family. You should be ashamed of the way you treat her. It is not her fault her parents divorced. When you married her father you agreed to be her mother. I am embarrassed for you and think this is horrible behavior. You need to check yourself and think about more than stupid furniture and think about how this girl feels. Her emotions and relationship to you is much more important than an old dresser. The truth is your biological daughter will not value that dresser the same way your step daughter will.

Somehow he got his ex pregnant and had a child, but he pays child support, so he shouldn\u2019t have to buy new clothes for his daughter. \n\nYou don\u2019t care about stepdaughter's feelings, because it\u2019s for \u201cour\u201d children.

My set was much nicer and she loved it so we got rid of her old dresser during the move. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 4 years now and my husband and I have a 2 year old daughter and are expecting another girl in February. We have been co-sleeping with our daughter since she was born and she has shared our room, but now we need to move her into her own room. I have always wanted my children to have my old things from my childhood and that included the dresser set. When we gave my stepdaughter the dresser I had made it clear to my husband that once we had children OUR children would be using it since it is mine. He agreed and still agrees with me so we decided to discuss it with my stepdaughter. \n\nShe was upset that we were taking it away, we tried to ask her to downsize her things so that she can store her clothes in the closet but she refused saying we should just buy a new dresser for our daughter. So after she left we decided to leave her clothes on her bed and take the dresser out ourselves. After she came back the next weekend she waited until we left the house and moved the dresser back into her room. My husband had another discussion with her and we let her know that was unacceptable. \n\nNow her mother is involved and is calling us telling us we are being unreasonable and should just buy and new set. The thing is my husband and I have also decided to stop buying new clothes for my stepdaughter as we already send her mother child support and we need both the money and space. Once she grows out of her clothes she will not need a dresser so there is no point in buying a new one when we need to save money. \n\nTLDR: I am taking back my dresser that I gave to her a few years ago so that my daughter can have it and she is refusing to let us have it back\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
