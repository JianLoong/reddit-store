But for a period of one week this one jackass kept parking in my spot. I left several polite notes asking him to not park there. I also spoke with the landlord and the apartment agency who both told me to \u201ccall us when he does it again and we\u2019ll arrange a tow\u201d.\n\nI would call them in the evening when I got home only to be told \u201csorry, no one is on site to confirm the wrong vehicle is in the spot, come see us in the morning and we\u2019ll arrange a tow\u201d, But the guy was always gone before me in the morning\n\nIt went on like that for 6 straight days. Saturday evening after going through the exact same song and dance with the landlord, I went to my moms a few blocks away and got the family truck.\n\nI dragged his car out of my spot and left it in the middle of the lane, went back to my moms, got my car and went home and parked and called his car in for blocking the lane.\n\nThe next morning, his car was gone and my landlord was at my door telling me it was incredibly inappropriate to move someone\u2019s car like that. I just told him I wasn\u2019t sure what he was talking about lol", "I would love to do that but I\u2019d be in the entry way of the complex \ud83d\ude02", "funny thing is I park in my middle stripe sometimes and they\u2019re like hey can you move your car? and i\u2019m like no dumbass", "His reasoning is that I have 1 readily available spot.
