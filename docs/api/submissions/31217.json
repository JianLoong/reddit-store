I also have a half-sister (7f) I'll call \"May\" who is a result of my dad's affair. My dad had an affair with a woman in her 30s, whom I'll call \"Mary\". When my mom found out about the affair, they had a huge fight, and it wasn't long before we also knew about it. My two older sisters and I went no-contact with my dad, and my mom divorced him. Initially, I didn't want any contact with my dad until I found out he got his affair partner pregnant. So, for the sake of my sister, I decided to reach out to \"Mary\" and my dad. My mom and sisters didn't approve, but they couldn't really stop me.\n\n\"Mary\" developed cancer when \"May\" was around 6 and unfortunately did not survive because they caught the cancer late. After that, my dad didn't want anything to do with \"May,\" so I decided to get custody of her from my dad. \"May\" is now 7, and I absolutely adore this little girl. She's a little ball of sunshine despite everything that happened to her.\n\nWhen my mom and sister found out that I decided to take custody of \"May,\" they understandably went ballistic. But I told them it's my choice, she's my sister, and I'll take her in\u2014I don't care if they like it or not. That shut them up quickly.\n\nNow, the issue at hand: My mom is hosting Thanksgiving this year and wants me to come because my sisters and their partners are attending for the first time, along with some aunts and uncles. I told her that if I'm attending, \"May\" will also be there with me\u2014I won't leave her alone during the holiday. She didn't like that and told me she didn't want \"May\" there. I said then I won't be coming, and that's final.\n\nA few days ago, I got a message from my mom stating that if I'm going to choose my dad's affair child over her and our family, then I shouldn't bother contacting her ever again. I agreed. Now, my sisters are on my case, angry that I won't be coming and that I'm choosing \"May\" over them. I told them they're welcome to do the same as my mom did\u2014cut contact with me\u2014because \"May\" will always be in my life. Technically, I have full custody over her and will also officially adopt her soon from my dad. \"May\" is my responsibility, and I love that little girl to bits.\n\nI talked to my friend, and he said what I'm doing is unfair to my mom and sisters, and going no contact is terrible. I'm conflicted. I understand that they don't want anything to do with \"May\" since she is the result of dad's affair, but they can't expect me to leave her alone during a holiday.

Good for you for adopting her and making an ugly story a beautiful one. Hopefully someday, your family will see it that way too.", "NAH\nTo me there are no a holes here. What you are doing for your sister is very awesome. At the same time though you cannot expect your mother and sisters to be on board. Would it be nice if they were? Yes but they are not obligated to. Your mother is probably still hurting from the affair and truthfully it is better to keep your sister away from that negative energy. Hopefully with time and some therapy your sisters will come around but your mother may never and you will have to come to deal with that eventually. Your dad and the affair partners are the real buttholes here.", "Nah. You made the decision to care for this child. Your mom and sisters did not, and their reasoning is acceptable, especially your moms. \n\nFair or not, you made a lot of decisions that hurt your mom, and it seems she's can't take anymore. Perhaps therapy can help, but I doubt she (or anyone) would want to be a grandma to husbands affair child. Taking on the  hold is a de ision you made, and you knew there would be consequences (as there is in all things). One of those was crating more distance with your mom and sisters.\n\nYour dad made a mess of his marriage to your mom and his family, then a further mess by abandoning his small child after their mothers death. \n\nInfo. In the year or so that you have had custody of your sister. What has your dad done to try and get back on his feet? Have you made time to be with your mom and sisters in general?  hired babysitters, planned playdates, etc, so you could spend time with them? Because I can see how they may have felt abandoned by you throughout this process as they felt abandoned by your dad. (Therapy could help)\n\nIf you truly want to find a way forward then I suggest you attend family therapy with your mom (and older sisters not 7yo). I suggest you attend individual therapy anway to help process what is happening.", "NAH People are so quick to jump on your mom and your sisters but can't realize how this devastated the family. They're not over what happened. I can't imagine your mom's pain of losing a long term partner of over 20 years. She built her whole life around this guy and had kids with him. And he betrayed her and now has a lifelong evidence of that too. And for your sisters, can't imagine family being ripped apart, seeing their mom devastated like this. You saw it too. And for them to see you reaching out to the affair partner and make nice with her, this would be beyond heartbreaking to your mom especially. It seemed to them like you chose your dad and justified his affair and gave your seal of approval too. Your mom is going to take a long time to recover, if ever. Your father traumatized her in the worst way.\n\nYou did right by the little girl that your father abandoned. She shouldn't be alone during the holidays. She needs someone in her corner.\n\nI can't blame anyone but your dad and his AP. Did either of them show any type of remorse for what they did?\n\nI'm not going to call your family hateful for wanting to keep distance from the evidence of a brutal trauma, especially your mom.", "NAH look it\u2019s great that you are going so far for your half sister (I think it\u2019s truly wonderful, I really do) BUT she is a living, breathing, walking, talking, piece of heartbreak for your mum. This is the biggest physical evidence of how badly your father betrayed his wife and family. \n\nAs much as think what you are doing is admirable, please try to see it from your mother\u2019s (and your sister\u2019s) side. She had been betrayed and cast aside by the man she loves and built a family with. \n\nNow there\u2019s a living, breathing reminder of that pain. It\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault but it\u2019s not hate and anger fuelling your mother\u2019s feelings. \n\nIt\u2019s pain. \n\nIt\u2019s heartbreak and betrayal.\n\nPlease don\u2019t forget that.", "Nta/yta\n\n\nBut your mother isn't obligated to invite the personification of her betrayal.", "NTA \n\nyou\u2019re doing the right thing. Your father\u2019s actions are not fault of your little sister, and your family should try to reconcile with that, as hard as it may be. You\u2019re not choosing your sister over them, your family is choosing a grudge against an innocent child at the expense of their relationship with you.", "NAH. You did what you felt was right, but your mother cannot be expected to accept her husband\u2019s affair baby into her home.", "You chose your sister. That\u2019s okay, but you can\u2019t expect your mom whom divorced her husband to be welcoming. That\u2019s just madness. \n\n\nIt\u2019s just a sad thing. That child will grow up knowing that she was the cause for a rift between your mother and sister. It would be best to be NC so she doesn\u2019t experience any bitterness.\n\nI applaud your mom for keeping her distance because children can feel where they are unwanted. Make sure you keep her around people that will love her. No child should grow up around people that hate them. It\u2019s better for her to set this boundary then a child be mistreated emotionally. \n\nNAH", "you seriously cannot expect your mother to take in your fathers affair child. I understand why your mother is hurt and it is unfair to her", "It\u2019s only been a year since Mary passed and you gained custody of May.  I imagine the wounds are still fresh for your mom and sisters so sitting out this year is probably still wise for everyone involved.  I would reach out to them again later, maybe after the adoption is final.", "NAH except for your father. I completely understand your perspective- May is an innocent child and you\u2019ve stepped up for her, which means she ought to be included in your family holidays. I also understand your mother\u2019s perspective- she feels as though she\u2019s been betrayed twice. It\u2019s not logical but cheating can be legitimately traumatic. Your father is the real villain here.", "NTA. Your mom is allowed to not want be around this child, but she can\u2019t reasonably expect you to leave a 7 year old alone on thanksgiving. The real a hole is of course your dad. Putting everyone in such a shit situation is unbelievable", "NTA. Your dad is a piece of work. Your mom wants you to leave a 7 year old alone for a holiday? Also, they're the ones threatening to go no contact with you. That's their choice.", "Can I just say, you are a very kind person for adopting your half-sister? She\u2019s just a little kid, her mom passed away, and it\u2019s not her fault she was the product of an affair. I\u2019ll admit I had trouble understanding the post because I\u2019m really sleepy, so sorry if I\u2019m confused about things. But genuinely, I think you\u2019re doing a very good thing. Your family shouldn\u2019t hate May for something she has no control over.", "NAH. I understand the position you are in. However it is flatly unreasonable for you to expect your mother to open her home to May and for her to serve her food.", "NTA. May is a child and is not responsible for any of the circumstances that brought her into this world. You\u2019re doing right by her and that\u2019s truly commendable. Research shows that children can bounce back from unthinkable trauma if they have at least one adult in their lives that loves them unconditionally. \n\nYour mom sucks, but let\u2019s assume she needs therapy to deal with her triggers over your dad\u2019s affair. Your sisters are definitely TAH. There\u2019s no reason they shouldn\u2019t be able to see this from multiple perspectives and know what\u2019s right. \n\nYour family wants to put this all in a box and never think about it again. May prevents them from doing that and that\u2019s not how life works. \n\nCarry on, best half brother ever.", "You're a parent now. Your kid has to come first. This estrangement was inevitable as soon as you assumed custody of May. No one should force a situation where your Mum has to be around a child she will always view as the \"affair baby\". No one should force a parent to neglect their child for family unity. \n\nYour sisters need to accept your decision to adopt your sister and this estrangement. They need to decide if they can maintain a relationship with both of you or if it's too difficult to be around May and No Contact/Low Contact is best. NTA", ">said what I'm doing is unfair to my mom and sisters, and going no contact is terrible.\n\nWell what else are you supposed to do? Dump May on the street? You chose to adopt her so it is what it is. Going NC is fine. NAH though because I understand why your mom doesn't want her around.", "NTA since you are her guardian and even plan on adopting her. For all intents and purposes she is your daughter now. Your father is a giant asshole for causing this situation in the first place and abandoning that child after she lost her mother.", "You are not going no contact. They are! Understand: you did something amazing for a little girl who is blameless and suffered a lot. Your mom should be fluffing proud she raised a great human being. \n\nThey are the ones messing up! They are choosing their wounded pride over their son + a blameless child that needed help. \n\nNTA.\n\nThe rest of your family, though, my god!", "NTA\u2026you did and are continuing to do the right thing by her. Let them cut contact, but don\u2019t block them\u2026they may change their tune later\u2026but if they give you crap onto the old blocked list they go. In other words, let them cut contact if they want but leave the door cracked until they demonstrate it should be closed. Yes\u2026she\u2019s an affair child and I understand how that upsets your mother\u2026but she\u2019s a 7YO blameless child in this and persecuting her for her soon to be not in the picture father is simply wrong\u2026any moron can understand that.", "YTA. You are forcing people to accept the affair child. Your mother and your sisters owe this child nothing. \nJust part ways with your mother  and your full sisters.", "YTA based on the fact you want to have a product of an affair at your mother's house. I know I'll get down voted but so be it. You are insulting your family.", "Nta, mom needs therapy? What you're doing is an amazing thing for a child that is seen as unwanted by some. She didn't ask for this life. Hard pill for your mom to swallow, I get that, and that's too bad she can't see how selfless you're actually being.", "You are NTA for taking the sister in and staying with her on holidays \nMom & family are NTA for not wanting a relationship with the child however they ATA for making you choose between an innocent child you adopted and them when they could instead choose to be low contact with you \nDad is TA on all fronts", "NTA but instead you are an incredible human being mate! None of this is poor Mays fault she didn't ask for any of this. You just had the empathy and decent human nature to care for a lovely little girl that's related to you when no one else would.", "I don't get how everyone (except the people on reddit lol, I mainly meant your asshole family)\n\nIs trying to blame everyone except the people actually responsible for this:  your dad, and his affair partner\n\nYour half sister is SEVEN \n\nShe's a fucking CHILD\n\nI understand it's uncomfortable, and all of that \n\nBut the only person responsible for your dad's shitty, selfish decisions are your dad, and Mary, depending on if she was aware he was married at the time\n\nPunishing you, or your half sister, when you are the only one stepping up, and actually taking care of the literal, innocent life created, impacted, and destroyed, because your dad is a selfish asshole, is ridiculous \n\nNTA \n\nDon't let anyone in your family, or otherwise, convince you, or gaslight/manipulate you into thinking you are anything but a stand up person\n\nEta\n\nI don't think you are wrong for sticking up for your half sister, who you have custody of, because your dad stuck his dick where it didn't belong, and *surprise* baby!

That is unhinged", "NTA. Good on you for stepping up and taking care of May. Your mother and sisters need to be able to separate your father\u2019s actions from the fact that this is an innocent child.", "May is about to become your child and it's your job to protect her. She is completely innocent in all this. It's not like you're asking to bring your father to dinner. I understand why May would be a reminder of your father's betrayal, but it's sad that your mother is willing to basically disown you because you are adopting an innocent blood relation. However, it might be too soon to involve May in the family holidays. She won't get a warm welcome. Find something else to do/somewhere else to go this year. After your adoption, you might be able to introduce her to the family on occasions that are less fraught, e.g., summer cookouts. NTA for keeping your distance and protecting May from the hostility.", "Nta, you sound very lovely and mature. Your mom chose no contact, that's her choice.", "NTA your sister is 7 and has lost her Mum. Why are your family taking it out on her? She's just an innocent kid", "NTA\n\nOf course you are right in this situation. It's hard to understand why everyone is against you in this knowing you are adopting May. Also impossible to understand your dad basically dumping his own daughter after the death of his current partner when May was already 7 years old.", "You're not chosing her over them. They are chosing to hate a child for her father's sins. Your mother laid down that particular ultimatum. \n\nI think it was a pretty deep betrayal for you to reach out to your cheating father and his affair partner and wanna play big happy family with the fruit of their multiple-life ruining actions. \n\nHowever. The kid is essentially orphaned. Is that what your mother wants? Would that make her feel vindicated? If the affair baby went to foster care? Or worse? Cuz that's pretty gross. You should tell her to get her head on straight. Nta.", "NTA.\n\nThey can't actually expect you to leave her alone. I know it's hard for them especially your mom to see her. But that's not mays problem. What's you're doing is great,  keep it up my man", "NTA. It's hardly unfair to stand up for a literal child when adults want to blame her for an affair. Especially when said adults thought it was appropriate to leave a child out of a holiday dinner that the child's guardian was invited to. NC is a difficult choice to make, but it sounds like it might be your best option right now, to be revisited in the future if you want to.", "NTA.  Obviously, because you\u2019re choosing to put the  needs of a child above your possible anger with your dad.  You\u2019ve drawn your line in the sand and are compassionate enough to realize none of this is May\u2019s burden to bear.  You\u2019re not choosing to go no contact.  You\u2019re choosing to prioritize a child.  What do they seriously think is going to happen?  Your dad has already checked out.  Where do they think you\u2019re going to park your child on this traditionally family based holiday?  Would any of them leave a  young child alone for hours on end?  The idea of that just seems preposterous.  In that respect, and in this specific circumstances, your mom and sisters are definitely AHs for thinking you should leave May behind.  \n\nThat said, your mother and sisters are on their own journey with regard to how they feel about the affair and the resulting child.  Does it suck that they\u2019re not in a place to accept the presence of May?  Absolutely.  Does that automatically make them all assholes?  That\u2019s less cut and dried.  It takes a lot of emotional bandwidth to get beyond our own complex feelings about a situation and view the various parts as possibly independent of each other.  I get that it\u2019s easy, from the outside, to focus on the innocence of this child and how none of this is her fault.  And how anyone who doesn\u2019t see that must be heartless.  And that is absolutely true.  But they have no relationship with May, so her innocence is an abstract concept that gets buried under the weight of their own emotions.  This is their issue to deal with.  And yes, I believe they\u2019re on the verge of just becoming total AHs (instead of just being situational AHs) if they continue to allow their resentment about the affair to influence how they treat May.\n\nSounds like you\u2019ve accepted this and are not allowing it to impact the choices you make with regard to May.  Unfortunately, this leaves you on a solitary journey in your effort to make sure May doesn\u2019t suffer because most of the adults in her life are too busy looking inward.  You\u2019re not required to offer up grace to the adults at the expense of this little girl.", "Classic case of a parent forcing the sins of a cheating spouse onto a resulting child. The only \u201ccrime\u201d they\u2019re holding against May is that of her own existence, she hasn\u2019t done anything to warrant their disdain, all the fault lies with the mother and father.\n\nAbsolute NTA, your sisters and mother are quite frankly despicable for expecting you to completely abandon a 7 year old with no other family on Thanksgiving all because the father couldn\u2019t control himself and she was the unwilling result. They need to get a grip and point their fingers in the right direction.", "Your family are all wankers and I'm genuinely baffled by how a hero like you managed to evolve from.that shit show.

However, if this is all very new and raw, I can see why your Mom (and possibly the rest of your immediate family) may be uncomfortable right now.  She/they might not have the emotional tools to treat May with kindness at the moment.  You surely do not want to subject May to a hostile environment.  But, I think your Mom is wrong.  Being a mother, she has some awareness that while this isn\u2019t her child, it is your sibling.  It is unfair of her to try and make you choose.  May has already had enough tragedy befall her, and you are her savior.  Know that what you are doing for her is something the vast majority of people wouldn\u2019t be willing to do.

I get that it is difficult for your mom to be around May, but she cannot expect you to abandon this poor little girl. She has been abandoned enough already. Sometimes we as adults have to look past our personal feelings and do what is best for the child. \n\nI am sorry you are going through this.

I also have a half-sister (7f) I'll call \"May\" who is a result of my dad's affair. My dad had an affair with a woman in her 30s, whom I'll call \"Mary\". When my mom found out about the affair, they had a huge fight, and it wasn't long before we also knew about it. My two older sisters and I went no-contact with my dad, and my mom divorced him. Initially, I didn't want any contact with my dad until I found out he got his affair partner pregnant. So, for the sake of my sister, I decided to reach out to \"Mary\" and my dad. My mom and sisters didn't approve, but they couldn't really stop me.\n\n\"Mary\" developed cancer when \"May\" was around 6 and unfortunately did not survive because they caught the cancer late. After that, my dad didn't want anything to do with \"May,\" so I decided to get custody of her from my dad. \"May\" is now 7, and I absolutely adore this little girl. She's a little ball of sunshine despite everything that happened to her.\n\nWhen my mom and sister found out that I decided to take custody of \"May,\" they understandably went ballistic. But I told them it's my choice, she's my sister, and I'll take her in\u2014I don't care if they like it or not. That shut them up quickly.\n\nNow, the issue at hand: My mom is hosting Thanksgiving this year and wants me to come because my sisters and their partners are attending for the first time, along with some aunts and uncles. I told her that if I'm attending, \"May\" will also be there with me\u2014I won't leave her alone during the holiday. She didn't like that and told me she didn't want \"May\" there. I said then I won't be coming, and that's final.\n\nA few days ago, I got a message from my mom stating that if I'm going to choose my dad's affair child over her and our family, then I shouldn't bother contacting her ever again. I agreed. Now, my sisters are on my case, angry that I won't be coming and that I'm choosing \"May\" over them. I told them they're welcome to do the same as my mom did\u2014cut contact with me\u2014because \"May\" will always be in my life. Technically, I have full custody over her and will also officially adopt her soon from my dad. \"May\" is my responsibility, and I love that little girl to bits.\n\nI talked to my friend, and he said what I'm doing is unfair to my mom and sisters, and going no contact is terrible. I'm conflicted. I understand that they don't want anything to do with \"May\" since she is the result of dad's affair, but they can't expect me to leave her alone during a holiday.

This could very well destroy our relationship.\" All of that would be totally fair and still lets OP know the gravity of the situation. Mom may still end up going no contact, but at least it wouldn't be a knee-jerk reaction. Besides, maybe there is middle ground to find, and they won't be able to do that if she has already given up on him. Then again, mom is human and her feelings are understandable. \n\nI guess I feel like if the choices are adopt a little girl he loves and lose mom over it or abandon a little girl he loves just to appease mom, and he chooses the latter, he'd be an AH to May and himself. I find sacrificing his relationships with his mom and sisters to make such a huge life change in adopting May says how important this is to him. Maybe that makes him an AH to his mom, but if he already sees May as his daughter, it's a sacrifice worth making... so I guess I can see putting him in the justified AH category.\n \nI do have one other question for you, if you don't mind. Can I ask where is he harsher towards his mom than his deadbeat dad? He didn't say anything insulting about her, he didn't even say she was wrong. I mean it sounds like he understands where she is coming from... or is just the act of adopting May that is harsh?

So I'm wondering if you had prior relationship issues with them?\n\nAgain go ahead and adopt the kid and give her a great life but why on hell would you think your mother and siblings are obligated to feel open to being around her just because you made this decision?", "NAH Except dad and potentially afair partner (they may not have known for all we know)  \n\n\nUnfortunantly, there is no easy way to handle this. You had a choice to either permanently damage that child, or permanently damage your mother. That's it. Those were the two choices. As hard as it is to say, either way you would lose one relationship. But you just made a choice, and that choice shapes the entire future bond with them both.   \n\n\nYour sisters and mother are understandably not ready to let go of the pain the affair child uncontrolably causes. Your sisters may one day come around, but your mother will never let go of this. And she shouldn't have to. Not only did her husband cheat on her and have a child, but now her own child is chosing the bond with this kid over being by their mothers side through a very terrible thing.

Neither choice was going to be easy and both were gonna hurt someone. Your mother is an adult, she knows how to cope and knows how to deal with these things.

And now through you she's never going to be able to move past that. Every time she see's you with May it will cut her to the quick. And if you forgive me, you attitude isn't helping.  You seem to have absolutely no understanding of your mother's feelings, or even want to give her room to adjust.  Instead of telling your mother that you were taking her in whether they like it or not, did you take the time to explain that you felt a duty to care for your sister? That you didn't want another innocent person to suffer for your father's selfishness, did you even acknowledge the pain you were causing your mother? Even inadvertently. It's amazing what showing a little understanding for other people's views and situation can do.\n\nSame with Thanksgiving. Frankly, you should have turned your mother down immediately, but gently. Stating that this year it wasn't possible, that you were helping May to adjust and that you didn't want to put your mother through any stress by coming since you couldn't leave May (you could also have gotten a sitter for a couple of hours on another day and spent some time with your mother, just to show her that you love her and acknowledge her pain.) Instead, you just delivered her an ultimatum, and when your mother reacted with an ultimatum of her own, it all escalated. Again, giving people space, time and understanding instead of demanding they do things your way can work absolute wonders.\n\nI also think you need to acknowledge to your mother that you have hurt her. You don't need to apologise, because you are doing nothing wrong, but sometimes even doing a good thing can hurt people, and acknowledging that costs nothing but would let your mother know that you understand, and that while it's not something you ever wanted to do, you feel it's the right thing to do.", "Your poor mum.

There is absolutely nothing unfair about what you are doing.\n\nMay is and has always been an innocent soul in this. Still, not everyone can open their heart to someone who reminds them of an affair that broke apart their family.

You are not asking your mom or siblings to develop a close relationship with her (though it would be nice if they could see May as your daughter and let her into their hearts). You are only asking them to (1) not exclude her from a gathering that includes you and (2) treat her with common decency. That is absolutely not too much to ask of them.\n\nIf you do want offer them an opportunity to salvage family relationships, you can ask them if they would be open to joint family counseling.

In that regard YTH, to a MASSIVE extent.\n\nMother is NTA for the ultimatum of complete NC, the betrayal of her son and not prioritizing his family in the least is more than enough to go NC. OP is the asshole for starting the relationship to begin with and would be with any attempts to bring her into the greater family.

No, it is not reasonable for OP to expect his mom to serve, entertain and cater to the affair baby.\n\nI agree that threatening to go no contact goes too far, but if OP is going to expect their mother to have a relationship with the affair baby, I can kind of understand.", "I agree, OOP kissed off that side of the family long ago, they need to realize he doesn't care about them or mom.", "Same.That\u2019s why she\u2019s acting out like this and threatening to cut ties\u2014she\u2019s reached her limit.Somewhere,OP seems awful too.It\u2019s great that he took in that little girl but I wonder why he got in touch with the two cheaters.OP refuses to see his mum and sister\u2019s POV and shows zero loyalty towards them.Idk,I just think something is odd with him too", "She cut contact with her son. She didn't lose him.", "She didn\u2019t lose a son, she\u2019s thrown away a son because he won\u2019t let an innocent child suffer.\n\nDon\u2019t mistake the rightful pain of rejecting letting the affair child in her life with the asshole move of exiling her son because he doesn\u2019t want his sister/daughter to be left to the wolves.\n\nShe\u2019s made the AH choice to cut him off, not the other way around.", "I mean you clearly don\u2019t love your mom because you never even thought twice about the pain you would bring in to her life going this route.

There is no need to justify why you don't want to be in anyone's life. No one is entitled your companionship", "No. It\u2019s ok for her to cut someone out of her life.", "Not even.\n\nShe's being asked to respect her sons choice to make the child who was abandoned by the same father that hurt her, and not cut him out of her life entirely.", "He is adopting a child from an able bodied father. A child that was the result of his fathers affair. Come on now.", "Doesn't mean she gets invites.", "You do realize that that doesn\u2019t mean that OP\u2019s mom needs to invite the walking reminder of her ex husband\u2019s betrayal into her home, right?", "and by \u201cno one\u201d you mean her living breathing father right?", "Who dumped her on the street?", "Don't listen to this person, /u/throa45.

Your mom is crazy for expecting you to just ditch a 7 year old on thanksgiving.", "Is it? \n\nInnocent child or not, she'd be around a product if her husband's affair. That isn't fair to OPs mother.

What I meant wasn't about them not having empathy what I meant was he cares for her when no one else would and saved this little girl from ending up in the adoption system or something.\n\nBasically I was giving the guy praise for taking her on and he's NTA.", "Well you also broke your moms heart by choosing someone else over her, so you both have that in common\u2026 \n\nDownvote away.", "I stopped understanding when a 7 year old wasn't invited to Thanksgiving.\n\nThat's just mean and spiteful. The thing that I'd be giving thanks for would be that I wouldn't have to be surrounded by such ugly people they would ostracize a literal 7 year old and have her be alone on a family holiday.", "Me either.", "I feel quite comfortable saying that anyone who demands that a 7-year-old whose mother died, *and*  whose father abandoned her, should now *also*  be abandoned on Thanksgiving by the only relative who had the decency and the heart to take her in and love her, is an AH. OP's mother and sisters don't have to love May, and not doing so doesn't make them AHs, but hating and punishing a small child for the circumstances of her conception is unconsionable \u2013 and demanding that she be further abandoned, even temporarily, goes well beyond AH territory. \n\nOP's mother and sisters are *advocating for cruelty to a 7-year-old whose mother died, and whose father abandoned her*.  Only an AH does shit like that.", "The girl\u2019s mother is an asshole for fucking a married man.", "No contact seems a bit harsh but honestly i kind of get it. OPs family especially his mom aren\u2019t wrong for not wanting to be around May but she\u2019s basically OPs child at this point, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect OP to never bring her to anything or bring her around them. Cutting contact is probably best for everyone involved, especially May. There\u2019s really no way for this relationship to continue at this point, the end is inevitable. I just wonder how no one saw this coming did OP not bring this up with his family before adopting May?", "I think they're the AHs for not accepting May for several reasons-\n\n1) it's been 7 years.\n2) OP is adopting May. She will 100% legally be his daughter. If his family won't accept May, they're assholes. What are they going to do, exclude him and his daughter for the rest of their lives?\n3) She's innocent. May had no control over her parents and didn't ask to be born.\n\nI understand being upset about May for a bit, even a few years. But at age 7? When OP is adopting her (he said so in a comment)? That's for life. May is his kid now. \n\nThis is an opportunity for OP's family to bond with May and learn to see her as family (because she IS family) and separate from the idea that May came from an affair, and see her as OP's daughter. I'm sure May is a lovely little girl who doesn't deserve to be alienated from family.\n\nOP is NTA.", "Thus my use of \"might\" and phrasing as that they can't bear having May at Thanksgiving.  I didn't say it was okay for them to say \"leave her at home alone.\" Since it seems to be unclear, I do agree it is asshole behavior to ask OP to \"abandon\" May at any time, and for any duration.", "Everyone other than OP\u2019s dad and the girl\u2019s mom are innocent in this.

Paternity fraud sucks and if a guy finds out a baby is not his when the mother is pregnant or the child is a young infant, I don't think MOST people would blame him for walking away. \n\nTypically though, these stories are told when the child is much older. I think if you raise a child they do become \"yours\" even if they are not bio kids. All that said I still wouldn't blame the guy from leaving the mother. Leaving a kid you raised is another matter. \n\nIf the mother in this story had raised the half sister for years and then decided to ditch her then she would also be the AH. IMO not wanting to start a relationship with the girl is very understandable. I think the fact that she is cutting off her son is a harsh stance but this situation is really complicated.", "They're talking about the mother's response to that.", "Yes, and Mom could have said, \u201cI understand. I can\u2019t bear to have May there.

I agreed.", "No he isn\u2019t. Saying, \u201cI won\u2019t leave my kid alone on Thanksgiving,\u201d isn\u2019t choosing anyone over anyone. It\u2019s being a responsible parent. Mom was the one who decided his choice meant he wasn\u2019t allowed to have any relationship with her at all.", "She is essentially punishing her son for deciding not to leave his child alone on thanksgiving.", "So how is op going to have a long relationship with his mother that never includes the new daughter in any way?", "Yep we loved and cared for my now deceased nephew who was a result of an affair. He is with my Mom now laughing and smiling and giving her hugs again. She and the rest of my family never turned our backs on him even when most people would. My mom had the biggest heart and I can\u2019t see how someone can do that to an innocent child.", "Same here. Would I be hurt about the affair? Of course!

She had a dad and mom until her mom passed when she was 6, right? And your dad was in her life until then too, right?\n\nAnd you would \"forever\" feel guilty so you reached back out while the AP was still pregnant? I mean, you could have gotten back into contact at any time. When the child was born or a few years old or decide to be there if she did ever decide to reach out. \n\nIt wasn't now or never. For you OR your sisters. \n\nThis doesn't make sense. There are some missing missing reasons here for sure or else this whole thing is fake and you need to think more about the realism of your protagonist's motivations.\n\nBut if it's real, ummm, is that your child?", "They  knew about the child for 7 years, hardly fresh. May lives with OP for a year after her mom's death.", "What\u2019s the point of commenting this under so many judgments?", "Well the mom FAFO. He doesn\u2019t have to have a future or any relationship with her or his sisters going forward. I certainly wouldn\u2019t.

She\u2019s his daughter. And no one is asking his mom to even meet May. OP is only asking not to be kicked out of his family for skipping thanksgiving dinner.", "OP isn't asking for that though. At no point does he ask her to welcome May. He has just said that because his mum wont have her for thanksgiving then he won't come either because he doesn't want to leave her alone. Which is completely understandable. She is a young child, of course you wouldn't leave her alone. That should have been the end of it. They were both fine in what they said. Completely understandable for mum to not want ex husbands love child in the house playing happy family's but also fair for OP to say that's fine but I won't be coming as I will be with May.\nBut mum shouldn't ask him to choose between May and her and threaten to cut him off if he chooses May. That's the point mum is an AH. Before that I get where she is coming from.", "It's not that he doesn't care about them. He just couldn't abandon an innocent child. His mom and sister's have each other, are adults and will be fine. Without OP, May has no one. His conscience is ok with grieving his older sisters and mom. His conscience is not ok abandoning his youngest sister, another victim of his dad.", "Her son sought out her husband\u2019s side piece to make nice.

OP does the only humane thing, which is to not go, staying with May instead.\n\nOP has more obligation to the welfare of his young sister than to placating his mother at May's expense.\n\nThe AH move is the issuing of ultimatums, not taking \"no\" for an answer.

God forbid you expect the adults to act like adults and deal with unprocessed trauma instead of externalizing it onto minors", "Yep.

OP is definitely not an asshole, others on this board are though.", "Agree a thousand percent", "OP\u2019s mom lost a man she probably thought was the love of her life. He crushed her, after a long marriage and three kids together. That\u2019s not the kind of trauma people just get over. And her sisters lost a dad as well, the 7 year old isn\u2019t the only one. Being older doesn\u2019t make it easier to deal with, it just means you process it differently. That man hurt these people to the point that they never wanted to see him or anyone associated with him again. And the 7 year old is a walking reminder of that. They don\u2019t have to want her there or have any grace for her - that\u2019s OP\u2019s job as her guardian, and OP is doing so. Nobody is wrong here, but it\u2019s just not something anyone is going to agree on.

He can't expect for them to welcome May with open arms. and if i were his mom, I also wouldn't want May attending.

As I mentioned, I was in university and didn't have time to go back home and meet them. What I meant by 'she didn't have anyone that wanted her' was that my dad, being in his 50s, wouldn't be very involved in her life. Mary, for all she was, was a good mom but was alone. She was a woman in her 30s who didn't have much family around. That's why my dad was able to 'manipulate' her and start an affair with her.

You don\u2019t know that. \n\nMy mother raised her brother and he\u2019s never called her mother when they were alive. She had him since he was 5.
