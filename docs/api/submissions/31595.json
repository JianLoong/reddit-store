I made all the food and desserts. I spent hours cleaning my house and decorating before people arrived. My only rule I have for my house is no shoes inside my house. It really grosses me out and I have a baby who crawls on the floor. I let this rule slide occasionally for things like furniture delivery/appliance delivery. Stuff like that where a worker needs traction on their feet. I\u2019d never want anyone to get hurt. I just clean after and they\u2019re courteous, to not step on my area rugs. Anyways, all went well. The guests were arriving. I told everyone before hand my policy. Most are familiar with it as they are family and have come to my house before. The problem arose when my father-in-law came. He walked straight into my kitchen with his muddy shoes on. I gasped as he\u2019s been to my house before. I told him nicely oh haha you are so excited to eat that you forgot to take off your shoes. He said, \u201cI am not taking off my shoes. I am here for a gathering. You don\u2019t get to tell me to take them off.\u201d My anxiety started kicking in. He told me I was a horrible person for making people take off their shoes and I need to stop being selfish. I proceeded to tell him he had to leave if he wasn\u2019t going to follow my rules and talk like that to me. My husband followed my lead. Well he left. Before he left he proceeded to walk all over my carpets. I sent him a really mean text saying that he was just acting childish. He made the day horrible. I told him off. Am I the asshole for asking him to remove shoes? Should I have let it be? I really did try to do my best to make guests feel okay about my rule. I let them know in advance. I bought new socks, slippers, and had booties by the front door for those who needed it. I don\u2019t know why he just didn\u2019t put the booties on then. Am I in the wrong? Should I have just let it slide? If you\u2019re hosting, should you just expect people to wear shoes? No one else had an issue with this. I\u2019m heartbroken and feel like I did something wrong. Am I an asshole?", "created_utc": 1700790525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182gmah/aita_for_telling_my_father_in_law_to_leave_my/", "score": 555, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Some people have gross feet and don't want anyone to see it. \n\nI personally think the reason FIL doesn't want to take them off is embarrassing, then you made a scene, so he dug in a little, more than you kicked him out. So he just regressed and threw a temper tantrum. \n\nI think the slippers and socks and booties are great for most people. But booties don't have traction and he's probably already older and not good on his feet so it's not easy. Plus you have to bend over to put them on, which might be hard for him. \n\nI think 10 years ago, I would have 100%, no shoes that's disgusting, but as I have seen people in my life firsthand go through things, it has given me a lot more empathy for the situation. \n\nI also think with 20+ people in your house, you're going to just wash the floors the next day regardless, so I personally have learned to let it go.

I know for a fact (my line of work) that there is an extremely high likely hood of stepping in something you wouldn't want tracked all over your house while out in public.

I made all the food and desserts. I spent hours cleaning my house and decorating before people arrived. My only rule I have for my house is no shoes inside my house. It really grosses me out and I have a baby who crawls on the floor. I let this rule slide occasionally for things like furniture delivery/appliance delivery. Stuff like that where a worker needs traction on their feet. I\u2019d never want anyone to get hurt. I just clean after and they\u2019re courteous, to not step on my area rugs. Anyways, all went well. The guests were arriving. I told everyone before hand my policy. Most are familiar with it as they are family and have come to my house before. The problem arose when my father-in-law came. He walked straight into my kitchen with his muddy shoes on. I gasped as he\u2019s been to my house before. I told him nicely oh haha you are so excited to eat that you forgot to take off your shoes. He said, \u201cI am not taking off my shoes. I am here for a gathering. You don\u2019t get to tell me to take them off.\u201d My anxiety started kicking in. He told me I was a horrible person for making people take off their shoes and I need to stop being selfish. I proceeded to tell him he had to leave if he wasn\u2019t going to follow my rules and talk like that to me. My husband followed my lead. Well he left. Before he left he proceeded to walk all over my carpets. I sent him a really mean text saying that he was just acting childish. He made the day horrible. I told him off. Am I the asshole for asking him to remove shoes? Should I have let it be? I really did try to do my best to make guests feel okay about my rule. I let them know in advance. I bought new socks, slippers, and had booties by the front door for those who needed it. I don\u2019t know why he just didn\u2019t put the booties on then. Am I in the wrong? Should I have just let it slide? If you\u2019re hosting, should you just expect people to wear shoes? No one else had an issue with this. I\u2019m heartbroken and feel like I did something wrong.

He didn\u2019t raise any of these objections, she said he\u2019d been there before, he knew the expectation, if he had any of these issues he could have addressed them to her respectfully rather than pitching a fit because she had the audacity to tell him not to wear his filthy shoes in her home. He\u2019s behaving like an entitled asshole.", "Yes, they are just the ones that go over your shoes.", "I work in medical devices so I\u2019m perfectly aware that is one definition. Another is a thicker sock with a tread, often called \u201chunting socks\u201d where I am from (Midwest).", "Yup, he is definitely pushing OP's buttons on purpose.", "Exactly. How do more people not get this???", "I live in Canada too. My family and most of my friends often keep our shoes on.

If it dips down into the 60\u00b0\u2019s I might wear socks to bed", "Grew up in country Vic, it\u2019s probably from that.

If people want to be like that at home they can. When they start defending it or suggesting the FIL is not in the wrong they should be reminded. \n\nYou can spit on your floor all you want. Don't tell people it is ok and we should let a guest in out own homes be so uncoth", "In the comments she said he comes over once a week and always takes off his shoes. \n\nHe was in the kitchen when she tried to give him the booties so he could've sat somewhere and put them on and then wouldn't have to walk in them", "They don\u2019t have to say anything they can put on a pair of indoor only shoes then.
