I have a feeling the sister is assuming she'd get the bedroom too, since who gives up their own bed to crash on a sofa bed 20 minutes away?

Her freeloading behind was just going to take advantage of what you paid for?  I don't think so.  Plus, she didn't ask she just assumed she was going to stay there for free.  Again, I don't think so.  Does she think you're not paying anything to stay there so you should share?  Or, does she just not care you spent your money, and her entitlement dictates she should benefit as well?", "Thank you :) and merry Christmas in advance too! :)"]}
