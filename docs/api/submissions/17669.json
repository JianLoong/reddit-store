I have MDD myself and it already makes my own life a nightmare. \n\nAnyways, I live in an college apartment with 2 guys and 1 girl. Let\u2019s call them R, T, and H. R and T are really good friends of mine and H is a sub leaser who moved in after she got kicked out of a previous housing. \n\nI am exhausted of living here because even though they are my best friends, I clean EVERYTHING. I also cook and do groceries and generally take care of all maintenance.  \n\nI\u2019ve told my two guy friends that I\u2019m moving out soon and I told them why, they told me it was understandable as they knew they were not good at participating. \n\nWhen I told H she got quiet and asked if she could live with me. I politely said no, and she got angry and stormed out. \n\nNow, she is the worst nightmare of a roommate I\u2019ve had. She\u2019s messy all the time, everywhere she goes it\u2019s like a tornado. She also never cleans it. And it spills to all corners of the apartment. She always eats everyone else\u2019s food and alcohol, even takeout boxes. She claims it\u2019s in the fridge it\u2019s free rein( absolutely not). \n\nShe complains I don\u2019t make ethnic food( I do and no one but me eats the food :/). She also talks behind my back frequently. Never helps out and throws parties when we\u2019re not there, and she will leave for a week after so we have to clean the mess. \n\nAnd lastly, she\u2019s an horrible pick me. Who slept on my bfs floor to try and get his attention after he refused to acknowledge her advances.\n\nAfter I said no she called me crying saying she needed me to live with her. I was the only reason she was able to function. That I help her live and that without me she will probably commit. \n\nShe called me again asking how I could be such a cruel monster towards her. I promptly told her that after all the troubles she caused I don\u2019t care what happens to her and then I hung up.\n\nI cannot take care of an adult child, especially who I don\u2019t like. \n\nLots of people have been calling and texting me saying I\u2019m an asshole and that I should care. That I\u2019m responsible if she dies.
