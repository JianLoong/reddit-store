I assume your employer provides first class so that you have room to prepare, not because they are generous.\n\nI would say that you could have told her that the ticket could be upgraded, that you both would have to sacrifice an activity or spending money in order to do that.", "NTA for keeping the seat because you need it.\n\nEver thought about telling her that you will need to cut out some of the planned activities in order to pay for her ticket to be upgraded?", "NTA, could also lean E S H. But there is an easy solution - switch off on the return flight.\n\nYour wife sounds entitled, but I also can easily understand why she would want to sit in first class. I can also understand why she would want to sit with you.\n\nI think it was pretty obvious that you buying her an economy ticket while you fly first would cause some friction. Doesn't take a genius to see that.\n\nAll you had to do was communicate the budget ahead of time and talk about the plan. Instead you made a big assumption and didn't include her in the planning and now she is understandably upset.", "NTA - she is joining you on a work trip, she doesn\u2019t get to interrupt your work for her vacation.  The first class seat is part of your working environment, it is not a vacation for you.  You can\u2019t afford that type of environment for her, so if she doesn\u2019t want to sit in economy, she can stay home while you work.", "NTA.   \nYour work pays for a business class seat so you have peace and room to work on the flight. You needed that space to prepare.   \nIf you\u2019d gone on holiday I presume you\u2019d have both travelled economy.   \nIf you could use frequent flyer miles, or afforded first class, it\u2019d be best to do that, but otherwise, this is fine.", "If your work is paying for your premium ticket so that you can get some work done while in the air it's somewhat not your ticket to give away.\n\nI have to travel a lot for work, too, I'm self employed so I almost never buy myself premium tickets.  I get free upgrades a lot, and if my wife is with me I hand it to her, I'm still getting the seat I paid for.

You fly for work there and she wanted to come there. It\u2019s not like you booked yourself a business class ticket, your company provided and they provided for YOU BECAUSE ITS A WORK TRIP.

If you needed to work on the flight, I can understand why you wanted to keep your first class ticket for the reasons you outlined in your post. However, you might be the AH for not upgrading her to first class with you. It seems that being in first class was important to her, so at minimum, you could have had a discussion with her about the tradeoff between her seat upgrade and some of the activities she wanted to do in Miami. I have to admit, it's pretty strange to be in first class while your partner is in economy class.", "The YTA comments would be the same people complaining that the guy sitting next to them was using up all their space because he has a computer and papers everywhere so he can work.", "Info: How much more was first class than economy? \n\nDid you offer her a choice i.e. \"OK, I can buy you a first class seat but if I do money may be tight and we'll have to skip xyz.\"?\n\nI understand your point about how the first class seat is a job perk that you earned, but I also can't help but see it as a bad look for you to be flying first class while your wife is stuck in coach, so I'm trying to get a sense of whether there was a conversation around it or if you just made the decision without offering options.", "Why not each get 1st class for 1 leg of the trip?", "NTA . If she wants the first class seat on a trip you\u2019re already paying for , SHE can come up with the money for it . It\u2019s not gonna kill her to suck this one up .", "NTA. Your Company paid for that seat so that you could work. Back half of the plane arrives at the same time as the Front half.", "NTA, You work, she doesn't.", "I\u2019m going to have to say ESH. I can\u2019t imagine what alternate universe you thought you live in where your wife would be pleased with being crammed back in steerage while you were living it up in first class. That being said, it\u2019s also unreasonable for her to ask you to switch, because then you\u2019d be sacrificing your own comfort and cramming yourself into steerage. And while we\u2019re at it, the airline sucks for being a typical airline. Next time, don\u2019t mix business and leisure, and you can avoid any resentment because you\u2019ll both be stuck in 4th class.", "Well, I think it would be expected that she would be mad.\n\nNot sure if that is asshole, but it sure as hell does not sound like anyway I would want to start a trip.", "YTA. Be nice to your wife. You get first-class flights all the time. She shouldn't have \"demanded\" it, but it says a lot about your relationship that you are so unwilling to make such a small gesture for her.", "YTA since you fly up there all the time. It would have been a nice treat for her. You will get to do it again, but when will we ever have the luxury again? \n\nThe me trip of discomfort for you would have probably done wonders for your relationship. Just a little extra care and appreciation goes a very long way.", "YTA. I 100% would have let my husband take the first class seat, especially if I flew first/business class on the regular as part of my job.", "This is your wife.

If she HAD to have a first class ticket, perhaps she could have waited until you two had more savings and could afford the ticket. \n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019ve traveled domestically and internationally for work, sometimes for weeks at a time.

I'd rather have the extra money for the trip, but it makes sense to let the wife in this situation play a role in making that decision in advance.", "I agree. Communication is always the best route however, OP is going for work. While he is at some conference, or business for half the day, his wife will be relaxing pool side enjoying herself.
