Nothing like the SAHW life. Sounds like she has it pretty easy.", "Might want to space it out Y T A otherwise the algorithm counts it as AH.", "First class gives you drinks, better food, and a little more ass/legroom.  Many people are carrying on like it\u2019s a mini-office.  It\u2019s not.  Working on an airplane sucks no matter where you sit.", "Yeah, very telling wording. He has a high opinion of himself", "Lolno.  Not his seat to give up.", "He absolutely could. His work will never find out who was in his seat on that flight. That\u2019s a non-issue.", "I\u2019m wondering why he didn\u2019t use points/miles? I used to work for an airline, and people who flew for work racked up crazy miles. Miles generally have to be under the actual flier\u2019s name unless there\u2019s a specific agreement with the company, so OP should have miles to upgrade or get a redemption seat.", "Doesn't matter if it's not top comment, which it definitely isn't.", "Shockingly, I can only fly economy with my job and frequently fly across the country. I\u2019m able to do so just fine.", "I agree with tweak two, but tweak one carries risk.\n\n>asking you whether you would prefer to join him in first class or be able to afford to do X, Y, and Z at your destination\n\nI've done exactly that, and it didn't work out. My spouse accepted the first class seat, but I had to hear how disappointed they were to be there and not get to do x,y, and z. Regardless of whether it was reasonable for them to be sad and mopey, they were. We ended up doing x,y, and z anyway, blowing the budget.", "So his work absolutely can find out. Some companies do request a copy of the travel ticket, and some companies will be alerted if the name on the ticket is switched to someone else.", "They don\u2019t need to switch the ticket. All they\u2019d have to do is switch once they get onboard. As long as the original ticket holder is ok with it, the flight attendants don\u2019t care. They just ask that whoever\u2019s in economy stays in economy.", "Yeah we but if he just exchanges the seat once they are on the plane then also can the company know?"]}
