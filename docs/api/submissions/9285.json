I don\u2019t think he was reasonable to accuse you of spending \u201chis\u201d money - when you choose to have a SAHP then you choose to share your income with them.

Seriously, I feel sorry for your husband he works hard for you and the family.

I think a conversation beforehand would've been in order. I'm also curious why his assertion that you only spend the big bucks on others makes you upset. I think that's a sweet thing to point out on his part, that you never spend that kind of money on yourself.

He probably doesn't even care if you spent a load of money on yourself. He's doing that to look after you, not for you to take the product of his labour and ingratiate yourself with family and friends at his expense.\n\nYour response that you would use all of his money and he would have a \"real reason\" to complain is missing the point because it seems like money isn't the important thing here (you're very *very* lucky in this regard, which you do not seem to understand).

If they\u2019re not actually in financial insecurity, and if this is his problem, he could buy dish soap, diapers and replace the appliances. And he probably doesn\u2019t need to worry too much about her underpants. \n\nSo her making frugal choices doesn\u2019t change anything for him because he\u2019s an adult with buying power. Unless she\u2019s literally prohibiting him from doing so, but at this point our speculations are so far from what it\u2019s in the letter that it doesn\u2019t feel applicable anymore.", "Nope a full month \ud83d\ude02", "Fiancee. \n\nI have no problem with people being a SAHP if their partner agrees, and of course the finances need to be shared.  \n\nA $1700 expense for a gift for a relative is just way out there, as is threatening to spend \"all his money.\"", "Designer handbags can be shockingly expensive. You can pay your bills for a year with the money it takes to buy some of them.", "Yeah, the more common designer bags you get at Marshall's, Calvin Klien and the likes, still run over $200 in Canada. \n\nReally high-end designer bags like LV start at 3000 CAD. So it's not a small purchase in that sense. It's so simple to just run things by your partner though.  That's why I feel that OP is TA because they could've communicated better.", "Sure, they need to have a discussion about reasonable caps for spending like this.  Both of them were not treating it as an urgent topic to discuss.  OP should have known it was urgent, since she was the one with the surprise large purchase plans.", "> So her making frugal choices doesn\u2019t change anything for him because he\u2019s an adult with buying power.\n\nShe likely impacts the rest of the household negatively by denying herself things or lacking in her self care out of a misplaced sense of duty. It also means he may have to take on the mental load of ensuring the household is supplied when that should fall under her portion of the division of labor. He may also have to provide a draining amount of emotional support because she is constantly stressed or denying herself. \n\nNot to mention, it doesn't feel great to watch someone you love suffer unnecessarily. She might not even like or appreciate if he tries to take on the responsibility of managing household supplies and her self care because she views it as bulldozing over the way she wants to manage things.", "Oh okay, that makes more sense lol", "OTOH, when you give someone your credit card and say \u201cbuy whatever you want,\u201d I feel like it is also urgent to put parameters on that then and there, if you have any. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that common sense wouldn\u2019t have most of us at least mentioning it before buying, but I feel they both contributed to their misaligned perceptions.", "\u201cLikely\u201d? This is wild speculation. All we know is that a designer bag is not consistent with what she regularly buys for herself and that it\u2019s \u201csort of\u201d true that she avoids spending money on herself (not the household, not the baby; herself.)\n\nWithout a lot more info, I feel a bit ridiculous speculating about the state of her underpants and the concentration of her dish soap based on the actual contents of the post.", "I am not saying she likely has holey underwear. I am saying that if he is bringing this up as a point of contention, it's likely that he is experiencing some sort of negative impact from it. \n\nI was giving a few examples on the difference between being frugal and making your and everyone around you's lives more difficult because of your spending habits. I agree that there isn't enough info in OP's post. Hence why my initial comment is asking her for additional context.", "Why is that likely? It\u2019s possible, sure.\n\nMy own lens here is that I am quite frugal (and do have a holy pair of undies - they\u2019re my emergency underpants for when I slack on laundry, don\u2019t judge me \ud83d\ude02.) It\u2019s not really intentional frugality, I just don\u2019t need a lot of stuff. I don\u2019t get joy out of buying things if I don\u2019t need it or already have a perfectly serviceable version of it. It doesn\u2019t affect anyone else, it\u2019s just my own stuff. I also don\u2019t like receiving gifts - I will graciously accept them, but if you ask me, I will tell you I don\u2019t want anything (or I\u2019ll suggest an easy consumable item for people who can\u2019t resist.)\n\nNow, the weird thing: all this has frustrated people in the past. When i have gotten windfalls, my partner would always tell me to treat myself. It took him years to believe me when I said I get more joy out of squirrelling it away than I do out of buying something just because I can. \n\nPeople have perceived my lack of desire to have more material items as me depriving myself or punishing myself or withholding joy from myself. And I think some people have projected their own insecurities about their financial choices or material overconsumption onto me. Truly, I don\u2019t care what other people do. And I will gladly buy gifts for people that I know will enjoy them.\n\nAnd I realize I am projecting all over this discussion and I don\u2019t want to say that\u2019s the case for OP, but I just wanted to bring it up because this is a phenomenon I have observed, of people pressuring you to spend money on luxury items and frivolities and getting frustrated when you don\u2019t want to."]}
