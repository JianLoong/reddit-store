He's doing that to look after you, not for you to take the product of his labour and ingratiate yourself with family and friends at his expense.\n\nYour response that you would use all of his money and he would have a \"real reason\" to complain is missing the point because it seems like money isn't the important thing here (you're very *very* lucky in this regard, which you do not seem to understand).

Maybe your experience is different on it, but I've never met a person who spoke this way and didn't feel it wasn't all equal and shared.\n\nEdit to add, I don't think it matters if the money has made it into the house yet to be \"ours\". My husband and I jointly plan for how much to contribute to our individual retirement funds through our employers, because a paycheck on the way still effects us both, and is for both of us to discuss.

We got the bags and the little slip that shows authenticity. \n\nI think we just bought the previous year's line \ud83d\ude06 it just makes us out of fashion!", "That's one reason I wouldn't buy one. People would presume I got it off some street corner. And LV is only beat by Gucci for ugly.\n\nI'm a Cole Haan groupie myself. I've never spent more than $500 for a handbag and that was a limited release of a classic woven, all leather, handbag. I met someone last year who had the original. Thirty years old and still going strong. \n\nIt's funny because the Cole Haan lovers will spot each other not because it's plastered all over with a logo. It's the weave. \n\nThen there's the delight when we see someone else wearing Zero Grand Oxford shoes.", "Okay honey listen, I think his point is that you spend money on other people before yourself and *he wants to take care of **you.***", "It's not about that. The fact she didn't ask him about a $1700 bag got a gift. It's 100% normal of someone gets upset about that. Then she said \"if you're going to mad I'll spend all your money so you have a reason to be mad\" easy YTA vote", "That was my take too but it\u2019s seems she is completely misunderstanding this and he isn\u2019t clarifying so ya a problem.", "Exactly. Comments like the one you\u2019re replying too ensure that I won\u2019t ever stop working after kids\u2026 domestic work is valuable and deserves respect but it\u2019s way to easy to be dismissed as a stay at home mom even though it\u2019s one of the hardest job just because you aren\u2019t bringing home a paycheck", "The thing is... it's still not her money. It's their money. If husband has to go to work everyday and you stay at home that has its ups and downs. You don't have to work to make money but you do have to ask if you want to make such a huge purchase and even worst, for a gift it's not even for you.", "When we were in Paris, my husband wanted to buy me an Hermes bag. I was like, are you insane?? We could buy a used car for that amount of money. (This was 10 years ago, before used cars went crazy.)  He was trying to be sweet, but I had to be the reasonable one.", "3 rent payments, depending on where you live", "Yeah, Coach is as high as I go and I spent less than $100 at a 4th of July sale at an outlet. I wouldn't consider it a designer bag but it's great quality and I love it. Designer bags are WAYYYYY more expensive.", "Coach is not true designer", "Agreed I hate those logo prints. The only one worse than MK is the LV logo and blah coloring...brown on brown. That's hideous!", "Oh my god I hate how Michael Kors puts his tacky ass logo on everything. Even if I think something is cute, I\u2019m not trying to be a walking advertisement", "She\u2019s providing free childcare. That\u2019s thousands she\u2019s saving them by not having a job with a physical check.", "I think if she stopped working to raise their child it's not a significant distinction.", "The difference seems to be that OP does not or refuses to use it to buy herself nice things. You buy things for yourself as well as other people. Would your SO be confused if you insisted walmart was enough for you but auntie needed Hermes? Probably right?", "Personally my husband and I approach it from the opposite direction.\n\nWe contribute to cover our bills, and have automatic withdrawals for our agreed upon savings to hit our retirement goals. We discuss the necessary savings once a year. Each of us maintains an emergency fund.\nAfter that, it\u2019s up to each individual to spend or save how they see fit.\n\nFor us it works because it\u2019s more about working within parameters we both set and agree to than  permission/restriction.", "You sound jealous.", "Lol not all. If I want a $1,700  bag I can go buy one. I just don't see the point if I am perfectly happy with my themed mini back packs and my other bags. \n\nTo me spending that money on a bag just doesn't make sense. But I am not knocking it, if it is what someone loves to spend their money. \n\nThey spend $1,700 on a bag, I spend $1,700 at an anime convention. Not different. Just different preferences. \n\nLike I said, I don't see much of a difference between the different brands of bags.", "She didn't ask because she probably knew he wouldn't go for her spending $1700 on a gift for someone else.  \nOP, YTA.  Maybe you should go back to work if you want to have money to waste on gifts like that.", "YTA. Your husband said you can buy anything for YOURSELF not for others, if that designer bag was for you i bet that wouldnt be a problem. You shouldve asked him first before buying for your aunt.", "This. OP, you bought a $1700 bag while not working? You just burned THAT much money from someone else, when you have a kid, and only one person in your household is working? Geez. Talk to your partner. Talk about a cap for spending. Apologize and DEFINITELY return the bag and take a hard look at yourself.\n\nI mean, you were working before this. If $1700 isn't that much money, why didn't you buy it with your own money?", "I don't think that was actually his point. I think the point is about interdependence and making OPs needs a priority. Sounds like OPs finance wants to care and provide for OP, but she resists it,  potentially even when she is in need. Then,  when it was about someone else,  she dropped cash without a care. Like other people were worth more than she is. \n\nNAH, but OP, one mom to another... It's okay to take care of you too. Also, this sounds like the rare situation where the person fighting with you is fighting for you.", "I wish I could like this 1,000 times!", "You aren\u2019t! Everyone is so fixated on the $1700 bag but missing the larger point that it\u2019s not the price of the bag he\u2019s upset about, or even really that she bought her aunt something, but that she spent that money on her aunt instead of herself.", "Seems like you missed this:\n\n> During one argument I told him I would use all of his money and then he would have a real reason to complain", "This is the comment I was looking for. He's not upset she spent the money on the aunt. He's upset she would never consider doing that for herself. My husband and I used to have similar arguments. I would happily spend on everyone but myself because I devalued my wants. He would get visibly angry every time I came home with something for the house/dogs/him because I hadn't even bought a new pair of shoes in 2 years. OP is TA for this.", "Well, you know what they say about great minds; I just made the same comment. They are a family, sharing resources, and they should be sharing decisions about major purchases.", "I didn\u2019t realize they sold designer bags for less than $300 lol. I\u2019d think that\u2019s be considered midrange.", "I like buying my Vera Bradley and American Leather Company bags on sale.", "I got my designer bag on clearance at an outlet store for $200. I don\u2019t plan on ever spending more money than that on a purse again unless this one gets destroyed somehow.", "I live in Australia. For $1700, most people I know would take a holiday to Bali, and come back with a very convincing knockoff designer bag that they picked up for $30AU while shopping the street stalls.", "I\u2019ve spent multiple thousands on bags before and my husband buys them for me regularly and doesn\u2019t care as long as I\u2019m not being absurd and I still ask before I buy anything that pricy because that\u2019s the way you do things. Like wow what if things are tight that month or something? And HE doesn\u2019t buy anything pricy without telling me first even though it\u2019s his money he makes. I just think OP is acting obtuse on purpose.", "They\u2019ve appreciated so much in the last decade, it would have been a much much better investment than a used car could ever be! It\u2019s actually one of the most steady investments in the world \ud83d\ude02", "same, i almost did the same for my wife in Vegas outlet malls and tried to buy her an expensive hermes as well.\n\nShe said, dont be stupid just get a cheaper bag as she would probably damage/lose it anyway and lets spend that money on a nice dinner for ourselves or a show\n\nI was trying to be nice/sweet but she is the best tbf and is like dont be silly wasting money on brand names that she doesnt give a shit about", "You should have gotten the bag! Prices were cheaper then and you could have sold it for so much more now. Made bank! \ud83e\udd23", "Honestly not even. A $1700 bag like OP bought would be considered the least expensive bag a \u201cdesigner\u201d would offer, like the entry level. But it\u2019s not her money, and it wasn\u2019t even for her. If my husband bought himself an expensive watch I\u2019d be like cool as long as we can afford it enjoy. If he bought he brother one I\u2019d be like umm he\u2019s a grown up he can buy his own stuff that\u2019s too much.", ">And it\u2019s not just his money if they agreed that their resources are shared and she should stay home.\n\nI agree with this. It's THEIR money, not his as they are a team and she's at home raising THEIR child. But having said that it's very bad form to make such a purchase from the family money without discussing it.\n\nI guess you need to set boundaries together so if one person is going to spend over a certain amount it must be discussed.", "Oh yea definitely. When we first got married my husband spent around a grand on one of his hobbies. He mentioned it, but wasn't decided on it yet. Then he walked in one day and said he bought it. And I wasn't happy. We had the money, but he didn't check with me first when I am the one who manages our money. \n\nWe have never had another incident of that. \n\nIt isn't about spending money like that on stuff. It's about the lack of communication", "Yeah I would just feel a little strange coming in the door with a dior shopping bag like hey babe I spent $6K of your hard earned money byeeee", "I thought designer was LV and high end retail was Kate Spade? At least that is what someone else said. Someone  explained nicely what the difference actually is. Like in construction of the bag and materials. \n\nI always thought Kate Spade and such was designer and that LV etc were luxury designers. \n\nSo idk! I am getting down voted for really questioning what the difference is, because I personally really don't see a difference besides name and price point. \n\nI see nothing wrong spending your money on treating yourself. I spend my money on crap I am sure others see as a waste. It makes me happy as I am sure people's expensive bags make them happy.", "I\u2019m in agreement I have a $30 Fossil bag that I love so much and get more compliments on than my vintage Chanel (it was my great grandmother\u2019s from the late 50\u2019s or early 60\u2019s)", "When I hear \"salary\" I think annual income. I believe the confusion came from the previous poster saying $1700 is more than their salary, which to someone like myself sounds like they're saying their annual income was less than $1700. But monthly is more understandable. It's not a lot but makes more sense than $1700 a year.", "LV and Gucci is sold at department stores like Nordstrom so it\u2019s still retail and is high end retail. But like a Hermes Birkin is not exactly retail but definitely luxury. (Also generally 10x the price of LV etc). I\u2019m getting this from my college textbook so not sure if it\u2019s the same as what those working with this stuff everyday thinks."]}
