But I think you should find out why she has started to act out and talking to her mother that way.

I am of the opinion if you don't want your step daughter calling your wife names...lead by example and don't call her names.\n\nIt sounds like normal teen angst but my approach would have been to say  \"I think you will regret speaking to your mother like this one day when you see how hard she has work to provide for you and give you these opportunities\"\n\nIf I were you, I would lead by example. I would apologize for the name calling, tell her that name calling is wrong and you are sorry that you did that but you also feel your wife deserves more respect for all that she does.", "NTA\n\nUngrateful brat is not a bad word. What would she prefer you say?", "assuming not fake NTA, the quote you provide seems a bit scripted but for all i know you had that in your head for some time\n\nmaybe your step daughter can try using less hurtful names for her mother. brat is a drop in the bucket compared to what you list", "If the conflict is between you and your wife, NAH. I agree with your wife that using the word \u201cbrat\u201d was unnecessary and may have been inflammatory, but it sounds like overall you were on the same page and she appreciated you backing her up. It sounds like this was just relatively minor feedback for the future.", "NTA but try to look into getting your family to group therapy and Elle into individual sessions. If the change has been within two years and the behavior has remained consistent or escalated, there\u2019s something going on in her life beyond justifying as teenage hormones.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry for being crass but if being called a brat is too much for a 16 year old to handle than there\u2019s a problem", "NTA\n\nAs another poster said, your wife is Ellie's doormat.  She needs to be more assertive.  Ellie may have anger issues that a  therapist would help with.", "NTA but clearly your wife is the reason why this is happening. She allows her daughter to disrespect her. Until that changes, Elle's bad behavior will continue.", "NTA\n\nMaybe stop doing things for her, ignore her as much as possible, just meeting bare minimum requirements for awhile", "NTA at all. Your stepdaughter is being cruel. Brat seems appropriate and it's a better one than the one I'm thinking of now.", "I understand why you lashed out, but you behaved exactly as the teenage was behaving.

She clearly has some major anger issues to deal with.\n\nI don't think you're an AH for finally snapping. But you and your wife would be AHs if you don't get this kid in therapy, and ideally start family therapy too, ASAP.", "I was pretty volatile as a teen, thanks puberty.

Your wife having two jobs is meaningless if it means that she has zero time to be there for Elle. And, let's be honest...

You failed.", "btw YTA for calling her a brat. Don't call your children names. It's understandable to be frustrated and this isn't some sort of unforgivable offense or something like that but you should definitely apologize for calling her a brat. Taking accountability for calling her names is setting a great example for her and you don't want to her hurt feelings anyway, that's not going to teach her anything.

Her language and behavior towards her mother sound like she learned it from somewhere.", "NTA, but avoid using language that labels people like \"you are being an ungrateful brat.\" Instead, focus on describing their behavior as ungrateful and explain the work the mom does so that the kid can get a new perspective. This may sound like just semantics, and it is, but it means a lot to a kid not to be personally labeled negative things and instead  have their behavior criticized.", "NTA.  Nothing wrong with calling her a brat as that describes her behaviour.  At 16 she is responsible for her own actions and behaviour (none of this she is just a child stuff).  Several ways to approach this.  Either get to the root cause of what is causing this behaviour in her so it can be worked through and sorted out (probably the better option).  Alternatively lay down the law about expected behaviour while she is in your home with consequences if she does not abide by the rules (a confrontational option that can have unpredictable consequences).  Either way the current situation can not continue.", ">she shouldn\u2019t let her daughter walk all over her like a doormat\n\nWell stated.", "She\u2019s 16. She wants to call her own mother lazy and fat the  she deserves to be called out on her attitude. And \u201cbrat\u201d is actually a nicer word than what she really is.", "16 is still a child. Parents-and adults in general-are not supposed to be calling their children shitty names. If OP wants her *not* to call her mother names, then calling Elle names isn't going to help, that's just going to make her feel *more* validated because obviously it's okay for her step-dad to call *her* names. \n\nI don't know what's going on with Elle and her mother (asked OP for info, haven't gotten a reply), but the fact remains that calling Elle names isn't going to help, regardless of whether you think she is one or not. She's still a kid and if she's acting out, that means she's struggling, which means she needs *helpful* adults in her life, not adults calling her names.", "No. I\u2019m sorry but most kids after the age of 13 know that words HURT and this 16 year old has been on an emotional rampage against her own mother. Being called a brat won\u2019t be the end of the world and it seems like it didn\u2019t even phase her. \n\nImma vote ESH because I feel Elle has been allowed to treat her mother like trash for far too long. This girl wanna act like she\u2019s tough then so be it.", "Why do you think it makes a difference whether she knows words hurt or not? That doesn't mean a grown man who knows far better should be calling her names, that's not appropriate. Even if it's not the end of her world. OP asked if they were right for calling her a brat, which as a grown man, no they're not. Calling kids mean names, even if those kids are being mean, isn't right. \n\nThis isn't a situation where some grown jackass was verbally abusing OP's wife so OP shot them down verbally in response, this is a situation with a *child* and two *parents* who are supposed to be *parenting* a child. OP can support the mother without tearing down Elle. You don't hurt children, or use hurtful language against children, just because they're being hurtful. That's not teaching, that's just being an asshole. Understandably, as I said in my original post, but an asshole all the same. \n\nIf Elle is \"acting tough\", then maybe OP needs to figure out why she feels like she needs to be tough. Maybe OP needs to figure out what is upsetting this kid. Not be mean. Either way, that's not the issue I'm addressing."]}
