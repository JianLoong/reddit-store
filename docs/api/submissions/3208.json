By the time they were in high school, they would hang out almost everyday and even worked together. Michelle often cited how he was her best friend but a lot of us thought that they were secretly dating. Michelle's stepdad and my dad even had an informal discussion about how Jared should treat women because of how convinced they were that they were an item.\n\nMichelle constantly denied this while Jared would either laugh it off or just be silent, but none of us took it seriously until we found out that Michelle was actually dating Jared's brother \"Lenny\" (29m). We were surprised and then shocked when Michelle confessed to getting pregnant and that she accepted Lenny's proposal. After that Michelle's friendship with Jared started to spiral. Jared even missed the wedding. Michelle was upset over this and I pointed out that she couldn't expect the friendship to stay the same AFTER she started hooking up with Lenny and that she should just give Jared some time.\n\nSince then Michelle and Lenny had their daughter \"Sarah\" (8f) who Jared isn't involved with and I took it as people just growing apart. He ended up moving back and Michelle was happy but then sad because Jared still expressed no interest in hanging out with her, Lenny, or their daughter. Then Michelle's (bio) dad died and while Lenny was sympathetic in the beginning he couldn't understand why she was still so upset since he was a deadbeat and her stepdad was a better parent to her.\n\nJared was the only one outside of family that Michelle would confess at how sad she was over the lack of a relationship she had with her dad. Michelle kept reaching out to Jared in grief and eventually she was able to talk with him at his place but when he told her to confide in Lenny instead Michelle yelled at him and then told Lenny which led to other people getting involved. After a confrontation at her In-Laws' house it was revealed that Jared had a crush on Michelle since Junior year, that Lenny knew about it BEFORE he started sleeping with Michelle and that's why Jared's relationship with both of them dissolved. Jared hates Lenny and while he doesn't hate Michelle, she's still Lenny's wife so he wants nothing to do with her as well.\n\nMichelle is shocked and angry that Lenny knew the reason Jared stopped talking to her and never told her. They've been fighting on-and-off about it for weeks, I know because she talks to me about it, and it's starting to get old. During one of her rants at Thanksgiving I asked if she was going to divorce Lenny over this and when Michelle didn't say anything I said \"then stop complaining.\" Michelle left early after that and when I went to call her she blocked me. AITA?\n\nEdit: Just to be clear this has been going on for over a month and I have done the \"let's change the subject\" more than once. Three times before I snapped at her.", "created_utc": 1669378525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4bz0d/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_to_either_divorce_her/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also agree that if she\u2019s been having issues for over a month then she needs to do something about it.", "Once upon a time similar thing happened to me as it did to Jared. Difference is my brother told me immediately after it happened. It strained our relationship but we are civil although I'm not close to him at all. \n\nIt's a shitty feeling and I feel bad for Jared. She also needs to stop dumping her shit on you. It's not fair on you. You're definitely nta but you need to set a healthy boundaries verbally that you don't want to be involved or talk about it.\n\nEdit: retracted a statement which I felt was badly worded. Also Jared not going to the wedding should have given her a decent idea on why their relationship became distant.", "NTA- She needs a therapist, not you. Sounds like she's really regretting some of her life choices right now and needs A pro to help her navigate this.", "Nta....i have a friend that does the same thing and trust me they don't want the divorce they want the sympathy and drama and for you to agree with them and let them vent which gets tiring.", "NTA. You are not her therapist. If she wants to talk this out until she is blue in the face, then she can pay someone to listen to her.\n\nAnd, obviously, she and Lenny need couples therapy at minimum right now.", "> Back in Middle School Michelle met and became friends with \"Jared\" (25m) and they used to hang out a lot.\n\nIt sounds like Lenny and Michelle never outgrew middle school. Late twenties w/ the maturity level of  tweens isn't a good look. NTA", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m exhausted after just reading this. Can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to be listening to this all the time. At this point, this is just gossip. Sounds like Michelle wants her husband & her best friend to dote on her & she wants you to jump on the drama boat with her.... you can say - No thank you. I don\u2019t think what you said was unfair. Don\u2019t get angry about it, it\u2019s not really your problem. Just walk away, hang up the phone, etc.... No one is asking you to solve Michelle\u2019s life problems. If she just needs someone to listen then I guess you should tell her to find someone else because you don\u2019t want to hear it. But don\u2019t get pissed off at her for having problems in life. \n\nETA \u2014 also you do realize that people can bitch about their spouse without having any intention of ever getting divorced, right? So maybe suggest some counseling. Then she can pay someone to listen to her & maybe get some help", "NTA. When someone complains constantly about their relationship problems, it goes from feeling sympathetic to feeling irritated. Yes, she's confiding in you, but unless she chooses to change something in the situation then what is the point talking about it over and over and over again? \"Lenny did this, Jared did that, I'm in the middle... I can't believe he did this\" or whatever... There's only so much repetition anyone can handle, especially if the person complaining is doing nothing to get themselves out of it.", "NTA - You know her whole story, probably better than she does. This tells me that you\u2019ve listened and tried to be supportive, but everyone has their limits. She\u2019ll cool down and unblock you eventually, but if she doesn\u2019t then she has a lot of growing to do.", "NTA you don't date your best friends siblings.", "NTA imo", "ESH. Thanksgiving isn\u2019t the time for Michelle to be ranting, and it would have been lots better for you to shut this down in a much less aggressive way like changing the subject or leaving the room. However, Michelle acting like some big secret has suddenly been revealed is ridiculous because Jared having feelings for her 10 years ago seems kind of obvious. Her huge reaction to this begs the question of how she feels about Jared now & if she wishes she was with him instead of her husband.", "NTA.\nThe only wrong thing you did was make aware that such a stupid, overly dramatic, tele-novela, setup could be real.\nThe world lost part of its glimmer today.\nBe glad you got blocked and run from this mess before you discover that your friend is actually or sister or that her daughter is actually your mom before time traveling.", "YTA. A month isn't really that long for a lifetime of  to settle. It takes more than a month just to find a marriage therapist to work things out. She talks to you about it because she thinks you are her friend. Meanwhile you are judging her and minimizing her losses. There were WAY more mature  ways to handle that if you care about your friendship.   Do you want to hear about it all the time? Obviously not. But you can't expect her to sit there and make small talk with you while her life is in upheaval either. Something like \"I'm sorry things are so rough for you right now, maybe we can schedule a coffee date for you and I to catch up and talk. For now, it's Thanksgiving. So let's focus on what we are thankful for and eat some pie. Want me to grab you and Sarah a slice?\". You may think her problems are trivial, but clearly she needs someone. If you can't be that person, stop being passive aggressive and set some healthy boundaries. But I also think its very immature, dismissive and unkind for you to say what you said.", "YTA. Michelle is obviously going through it and being a dick to her isn\u2019t much help. Even asking if she\u2019s going to divorce her husband is a bit forward but using her lack of answer (who knew divorce was a complicated topic) to basically tell her to shut up is just insensitive. There are infinitely many nicer ways you could\u2019ve dealt with this.", "YTA. Her world was turned upside down and she thought she could confide in you. She's hurt and confused. That's not just complaining. You're supposedly close and that's what close family usually does for one another.\n\nBut if you didn't want to hear it, there were many better ways you could have phrased it. Snapping out of nowhere was not a good way. You literally could have just said \"I know you're in a bad place, but this isn't something I can help you on. This is for you and your husband to work through\" That simple.", "YTA. She needed support, not you being so confrontational. It might\u2019ve been \u2018annoying\u2019 for you, but it\u2019s her life and she feels lied to by her husband. A little empathy goes a long way.", "YTA - there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying \u201cI think we need to change the subject\u201d and moving on", "Yta\n\nThere's a time and place for stuff like this and thanks giving dinner ain't it. That was super immature and rude of you.\n\nShe's going through a lot and she thought you were a better friend than you actually are. Way to go.", "You seem annoyed with her and tired of listening to her, which is understandable. Especially if she is obsessing but your reaction was a bit much. You snapped and had to expect a reaction, she's hurt and you made it clear you are not a safe person to express her emotions with. She blocked you out of hurt, maybe you should be relieved, you ultimately got what you wanted. She won't be bugging you with that kind of stuff anymore. You seem to both lack self awareness and tact. YTA you were insensitive and asking her about divorce when is was clearly breakingdown was just crass. Leave her be and accept that she is done with you and ultimately you got what you wanted", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Michelle should have known, even if Jared **didn\u2019t** have a crush on her, that hooking up with his brother would permanently alter their relationship. \n\nLenny is a shark, utterly disloyal to his brother.
