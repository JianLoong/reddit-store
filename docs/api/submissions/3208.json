By the time they were in high school, they would hang out almost everyday and even worked together. Michelle often cited how he was her best friend but a lot of us thought that they were secretly dating. Michelle's stepdad and my dad even had an informal discussion about how Jared should treat women because of how convinced they were that they were an item.\n\nMichelle constantly denied this while Jared would either laugh it off or just be silent, but none of us took it seriously until we found out that Michelle was actually dating Jared's brother \"Lenny\" (29m). We were surprised and then shocked when Michelle confessed to getting pregnant and that she accepted Lenny's proposal. After that Michelle's friendship with Jared started to spiral. Jared even missed the wedding. Michelle was upset over this and I pointed out that she couldn't expect the friendship to stay the same AFTER she started hooking up with Lenny and that she should just give Jared some time.\n\nSince then Michelle and Lenny had their daughter \"Sarah\" (8f) who Jared isn't involved with and I took it as people just growing apart. He ended up moving back and Michelle was happy but then sad because Jared still expressed no interest in hanging out with her, Lenny, or their daughter. Then Michelle's (bio) dad died and while Lenny was sympathetic in the beginning he couldn't understand why she was still so upset since he was a deadbeat and her stepdad was a better parent to her.\n\nJared was the only one outside of family that Michelle would confess at how sad she was over the lack of a relationship she had with her dad. Michelle kept reaching out to Jared in grief and eventually she was able to talk with him at his place but when he told her to confide in Lenny instead Michelle yelled at him and then told Lenny which led to other people getting involved. After a confrontation at her In-Laws' house it was revealed that Jared had a crush on Michelle since Junior year, that Lenny knew about it BEFORE he started sleeping with Michelle and that's why Jared's relationship with both of them dissolved. Jared hates Lenny and while he doesn't hate Michelle, she's still Lenny's wife so he wants nothing to do with her as well.\n\nMichelle is shocked and angry that Lenny knew the reason Jared stopped talking to her and never told her. They've been fighting on-and-off about it for weeks, I know because she talks to me about it, and it's starting to get old. During one of her rants at Thanksgiving I asked if she was going to divorce Lenny over this and when Michelle didn't say anything I said \"then stop complaining.\" Michelle left early after that and when I went to call her she blocked me.

There were WAY more mature  ways to handle that if you care about your friendship.   Do you want to hear about it all the time? Obviously not.

But she hooked up with his brother who knew how he felt about her, people don't really understand that.\n\nshe isnt in the wrong or is a bad person,  however is not unreasonable idea for Jared to distant himself to both of them and she should have gotten the picture when he didnt go to the wedding and was distant before the wedding. As for the niece who is innocent, it's also not unreasonable that he doesn't have a relationship with her when he doesn't have a relationship with her parents. I also felt he was reasonable in his response by saying he isn't her comfort person anymore and it's also more of an issue because her husband is his brother, so it's kinda inappropriate that she went to him anyways.", "Michelle must've been either incredibly dumb, naive or ignorant  if she never realized his crush and Lenny either just seems like an AH or a neutral party. You could say he knew about the crush beforehand, but Jared also never made a move, so that's on him. No idea what my opinion is here, but for the story I'll go with NTA.  \nSure it sucks for her that nobody else gets her like Jared did, but she made her choice and now has to live with the consequences.", "From Jared perspective from his post, he had gone to his older brother for advice on how to approach Michelle, therefore is brother knew he had a crush on Michelle.", "Thought the same. He's well within his rights to pull the plug on the friendship if it hurts his feeling even though he never made a move AND he's also well within his rights to not be an emotional support person for someone he hasn't been in touch with for almost a decade.\n\nYou normally pay a professional for this kind of help.", ">Why was he deemed the AH? He was pretty respectful.\n\nBecause he was a man posting this.  Reddit have a bias against men.", ">I thought the same thing! I voted him NTA.\n\nSo did I.", "there\u2019s a huge gap in responses based on whether op is male or female, in almost any post on this sub.", ">she should have gotten the picture when he didnt go to the wedding and was distant before the wedding.\n\nIf she had no idea he had feelings for her, I can't blame her for not knowing why her friend is suddenly not interested in being her friend. It sounds like they were pretty close as teens, and while sometimes friendships do naturally drift apart, depending on how he managed it, she may have been totally blindsided by him pulling away all of a sudden. \n\nAnd it's one thing to notice a friend distancing themselves and another thing to know *why.* I imagine anyone would be upset if a close friend suddenly started pulling away with no explanation.", "Yeah some users tend to make up their minds based on gender alone or even worse, they tend to flip flop accordingly.", "Michelle/Emily had 8 years to reach out to Jared. She should not have been blindsided by her former best friend who has been actively avoiding her family for the better part of a decade and somehow that *didn't* prompt a conversation at an earlier point of time."]}
