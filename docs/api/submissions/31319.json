Me and brother have always been quite close and he came to me for advice and to mediate when he spoke to his fianc\u00e9 about his doubts.\n\nI figured he was having a bit of cold feet and told them both to take a bit of time from each other. They have also both been very stressed navigating wedding planning and they had just bought a business together so it\u2019s quite difficult to not spend time with each other.\n\nIt turns out his head had been turned by a girl (our cousins fianc\u00e9s sister). He asked me if he should explore things with this girl while him and his fianc\u00e9 were taking a bit of a break and I told him it was immoral and if he thinks the grass might be greener he needs to discuss this with his fianc\u00e9 or break of the engagement and end the relationship. At the time he seemed to agree it was wrong to pursue things with the other girls.\n\nLast night we stayed over at our cousins house and I caught my brother on top of the other girl sucking face with her. I blew up at him and told him that cheating isn\u2019t ok, let alone with someone who will cause damage in several relationships. He behaved like it wasn\u2019t a big deal and if I hadn\u2019t caught them it would have been a slight make out session and nothing more. He proceeded to tell me I was being melodramatic mtic and that nothing happened.\n\nI was extremely angry and disappointed and I told him that he needed to be honest with his fianc\u00e9, cut her loose and put her out of her misery or I would tell her.

His betrayal of his fianc\u00e9e is not just a mere indiscretion; it's a grand spectacle of moral bankruptcy. He's not content with ruining one person's life; he's on a mission to leave a trail of destruction in his wake. His attempts to gaslight you into thinking it's no big deal showcase a level of delusion that would make even the most accomplished con artists jealous. If he thinks for a second that he can escape unscathed from the web of lies he's weaving, he's in for a rude awakening. Your ultimatum is a mercy compared to the hurricane of consequences he's about to face, and frankly, it couldn't happen to a more deserving scoundrel.", "NTA, he is treating both this girl and his fianc\u00e9e poorly, one he is using and the other he is breaking promises to. Both girls need to run.", "NTA.\n\nOh my god. Please save your brother from a lifetime of misery with a women who will quite reasonably hate him for his infidelity and immaturity. She deserves to know. She deserves to save herself. He deserves to find a good woman **if and only if** he fucking grows up.", "NTA\n\n7 years and finally popped the question?  His hearts not in it and this episode proves it.  He will cheat again.  He needs to do the right thing and cut fianc\u00e9 loose", "NTA, tell the fianc\u00e9. Save her!", "NTA, he is 30 years old not 23 he is a grown man and knows what he is doing. He is hoping someone else will say something and can spin it leave the realtionship and look like a victim. Why your cousin would let her friend make out with her basically married cousin is beyond me. I would have told her to back off he is taken and not worth her time anyway. I mean your friends how old or they? 20? I mean if I knew he was on a break from his fiancee after 8 years big red flag. I would be like does he want to get married or just not her? Either way I would not give him the time of day. Your friendship would be over if anything happened and then he got married. Plus he is a cheater. I don\u2019t understand why girls would knowingly do that anyway. I have no desire to be that girl. He needs to man up, he is 30 care enough to let her go now than to marry her have a few kids and cheat the whole time. If was the cousin I would certainly tell my friend he was a low down no good cheater and could care less who he hurts. She deserves better.", "NTA and no you shouldn't be on your brothers side. The best thing you can do for your family is call them out for their mistakes so they don't repeat them or end up somewhere they regret (like married to his fiance seemingly). I'd tell him he needs to be honest with her that he's kissed someone else and talk it out with her and see what she wants to do and really reflect on whether he WANTS this marriage or if he's only doing it cus it seems like the next step. A lot of people only get married because they think it's time and not because they actually want to. However he definitely needs to tell his fiance now cus she needs to decide whether or not she can forgive him for that, and personally if he didn't I think you should tell his fiance for him (which you should tell him you would do and that it would be worse for him if she finds out from someone other then him). I know some people don't think it's right to do smth like that but personally I'd wanna know if my fiance was cheating on me but be careful because that does come with it's own risks (like there's been cases where the fiance would forgive the cheater and then the one who told her might be looked down upon for trying to break up the marriage or smth yk). It's risky but just follow your gut and hope for the best.", "NTA. It sounds like your brother has already checked out of the relationship with his fianc\u00e9e but didn\u2019t let her in on that fact. He\u2019s stringing her along at this point and monkey branching into a new relationship while keeping his fianc\u00e9e on the back burner in case things with the new girlfriend don\u2019t work out. \n\nYou\u2019ll be doing his fianc\u00e9e a favor by letting her know what\u2019s actually going on.", "NTA if it's nothing then it's not a problem his fiance knowing.l", "Nope he is fuck that guy", "NTA. Talk to the fiance. She doesn't deserve to be married to a cheater. If she stays around, that is her choice and her future to live with. Otherwise, let her find a man to show her respect.", ">He asked me if he should explore things with this girl while him and his fianc\u00e9 were taking a bit of a break\n\nInfo:  Well are they are on a break?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe and his fiance are taking a break - so he is fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd YOU should get a life of your own instead of trying to live your brother's live for him.", "YTA. It's one thing to give advice when it's asked for, but trying to control someone else's behavior is way out of line. Your brother is a fully grown adult; he's entitled to ask your advice and then take it or not.", "YTA. Cheating is never okay, and your brother's behavior is completely disrespectful to his fianc\u00e9. It's clear that he has some serious commitment issues that he needs to work through. Giving him an ultimatum may be harsh, but it seems like a necessary wake-up call for him to understand the gravity of his actions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Of course I\u2019m very mad at him and think what\u2019s he\u2019s done is wrong but at the end of the day he\u2019s my brother and I do want to make sure I handle this in a way that doesn\u2019t destroy my relationship with him.", "Thank you.

And it\u2019s our cousin brothers future sister in law who he made out with. the cousin doesn\u2019t know about the incident, he would quite literally murder my brother as they are very close and he is very protective of his future SIL. I\u2019m not sure why the SIL thought it was ok to make out with an engaged man, and she is as much to blame but I don\u2019t really want to make things even worse by telling on her to her sister and my cousin brother.", "Thankyou. This is a great perspective, I don\u2019t think he wants to get married ever, not just to his fianc\u00e9. I\u2019m honestly riddled with guilt knowing this information and feel I\u2019m like I\u2019d be betraying him by telling her. But if he doesn\u2019t tell her I feel like morally I should tell her even if it causes backlash for me.", "Thank you. I think you\u2019re right, I think he checked out quite a while ago and it took someone turning his head to realise how checked out he was. \n\nI think he\u2019s being cruel keeping her on the back burner and it sucks even more that she is genuinely one of the nicest people you could meet - it\u2019s something so many people have said to me about her.", "I know it\u2019s very Ross and Rachel, but not on a break, just trying to see other less outside of work while he worked out what he wanted. He\u2019s started therapy and they\u2019ve done a couple of sessions together too.", "Thank you for your honesty", "Fair enough, is controlling his behaviour the giving him an ultimatum? I appreciate he doesn\u2019t have to take my advice, and I gave it hoping he would take it but I knew it would be his choice at the end of the day. \n\nDo you think he\u2019s correct in exploring options and hiding it from his fianc\u00e9?", "It seems like you agree with my choice, how come you think I\u2019m the asshole?", "Give your brother a jockstrap and some running shoes.  He's going to need both when his fiancee inevitably finds out.  He is not nearly as slick as he thinks he is.", "I'm curious; why did he propose if he doesn't want to ever get married?", "Ofc anytime. If so then that's definitely a convo he needs to have with her too. It's fine to not want to ever be married and it's fine to not want a monogamous relationship. It's not OK to lead someone who does want those things on. Sometimes no matter how much you care for someone you can just have an inherent incompatibility that can't be helped.\n\nI get the guilt and betrayal thing. You're definitely in a very difficult position here. If you do decide to tell her, just remember it's not on you that he decided to cheat and she deserves to know and make an informed decision of how she wants to carry it on. If he was doing it so carelessly for you to see in the first place chances are she'll find out eventually and if she does break it off telling her will just save a lot of time and stop a lot of hurt. If your brother does decide he wants to stay with her (and the marriage thing isn't a deal breaker) then it's better for him to try and get over this quickly because the longer he waits the harder it'll be for him to admit and the less likely she'll forgive him. Finding out your partner cheated on you a few days ago but felt guilty and told you quickly personally I might be able to get over (given how many big changes are going on so there's a lot of emotions), but if I find out months later I don't think I'd get over it because if he can keep smth like that a secret for so long then I'd always wonder what else he could be hiding from me yk.\n\nI agree morally you should but it's also understandable if you don't since there is so much to consider. I'd at least urge your brother to be honest with her. I really hope it works out for the best.", "nta", "An ultimatum is very much controlling behavior. It's an implied threat - \"either you do what I tell you or I will punish you\". They have a tendency to backfire on the person issuing them, especially if your advice doesn't work out well in the long run.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether he's correct or not. He's clearly going through something. Even if he's not handling himself all that well, it's his life to lead. \n\nIf you want to help him, invite him to talk about his thoughts and feelings. Ask insightful questions to help him think it through for himself. Tell him you understand and you know he'll make good decisions for himself. Put your hand on his shoulder. Ask what you can do to help.\n\nIssuing an ultimatum may create a resentment that will be remembered for a lifetime. We also remain forever grateful to those who supported us in tough times. Times pass and people move on, but memories don't. How do you want to be remembered?", "It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been asking him a lot since this started and he doesn\u2019t have a straight answer. We\u2019re of Asian background and I think there\u2019s some pressure from that and the parents, and it\u2019s the \u201cdone\u201d thing. He\u2019s previously said that he would go through with the marriage to be with her, but now that push has come to shove it seems to have gotten to him is my guess.", "I do agree, I think time is a huge factor which is why I ultimatumed him. \n\nI don\u2019t think they thought they would get caught as everyone was asleep, what he didn\u2019t know was that I had kept the light on in the room we were sharing and woke up to the light being on and went looking for him. \n\nI\u2019ve known him his whole like and this one incident is making me question what else he could have done that he knows was wrong and has never told me about. So I can only imagine what would go through her mind whenever she finds out.", "In all honesty I\u2019ve only really been thinking about his fianc\u00e9 after catching him. I told him from the get go of his doubts about the relationship that I wasn\u2019t able to be completely impartial because I care about them both and agreed to be there for him and strongly suggested therapy may be better than talking to just me. He decided to take up therapy and so I\u2019m fully aware he is going through some stuff that he needs to sort through.\n\nThe way I saw the event from last night was him being selfish and thinking with his dick - which he might be but that\u2019s for him to deal with.\n\nThankyou, you\u2019ve given me quite a bit to think about.", "Yeah, I figured it was something like that. Feeling pressured to propose and settle down, I mean. Not that that excuses his behavior *at all*.", "Oh yeah that's smart.\n\nMakes sense still though they weren't being too careful doing it in a house with other people. Either way since you clearly are so against it I think the news will eventually break one way or another.\n\nYeah exactly. There's a way he can do it which might not wreck their relationship (as long as the marriage thing doesn't also break it anyway). Like everyone's different but imo best case scenario is for her to hear it from him as soon as possible and to just try to have an open conversation with her about why he felt the need to do it (whether that be cold feet, cus he doesn't want to get married or just because of all the stress and pressure). Yeah there's still a risk it's a deal breaker but as you said knowing someone can hide one big secret like that or do something like that with seemingly little to no guilt definitely makes your head run wild with what else they could be hiding or could have done.", "Look, bro enlisted your help at a time when he thought you would help him with his relationship. He thought you would do something to HELP him. That means you are now involved in something in which you never intended to be involved. \n\nNow, I normally would not advocate going to the fianc\u00e9e behind bro\u2019s back. But he\u2019s put you in this situation because he trusts your judgement. Well, it\u2019s time to let your judgement loose. Just because he may not agree with your judgement is irrelevant. He put you there and now come the consequences. You\u2019d be saving the fianc\u00e9e, the lady with whom he was sucking face and ,finally, yourself by setting the record straight. Do it because it\u2019s the right thing, not to mollify your cheating brother. Finally, you need to be able to look in the mirror after this debacle ends.", "I'm sure you were right about how he was thinking. ;) Good luck to you; he's lucky to have a brother that cares so much.", "Of course not, no excuse whatsoever ever. Of all ways he could have have handled all of this I feel like he\u2019s done it all the worst way and the most immature way."]}
