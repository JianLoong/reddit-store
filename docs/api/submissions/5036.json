(Which means to duck out without an overt goodbye -- formal hellos and goodbyes are very difficult for me b/c of my anxiety -- my friends understand this.)\n\n**Conflict**: As soon as the words left my mouth, someone in the chat window has a minor meltdown. They repeated several times how awful it was that I used such a phrase. The moderator had to tell them to let it go -- so then they messaged the moderator to accuse them of anti-Irish feelings. And then they left, dramatically telling everyone to kiss off.\n\nMy reaction: I'm an anxious and kind of sensitive person, so this soured the whole meeting for me. And in fact, I didn't go back to that, or any, meeting for quite some time.

I've looked it up, and it was a joke started by Irish-Americans in Boston, so it wouldn't even be anti-*Irish,* to be fair. Maybe their offense has more to do with the drunken part of the stereotype? Anyway, letting their feelings be known is one thing, but carrying on about it and then permanently punishing you for it is completely unnecessary.

The phrase has no super negative connotations against Irish in particular, but given its origins, maybe not the best thing to say around people recovering from any addiction.", "There's no heavy baggage with that phrase.

I\u2019m not offended by Irish goodbye, but I am greatly offended by \u201cpatty wagon.\u201d It\u2019s interesting how these phrases slip into everyday language without us realizing they\u2019re offensive until decades later.

Basically, leaving without saying goodbye to your hosts is considered rude everywhere, but people do it nevertheless. Similarly, any time you attribute rude behavior to another ethnic or national group, it's rude, but people do it nevertheless. Similarly, it's rude to get your knickers all up in a knot when someone utters a commonly-used that might possibly be considered offensive to someone, rather than just letting it go or dropping a quiet, private note to the person who said it. \n\nThere is no specific baggage associated with that phrase. However, it is generally better judgement to avoid expressions that use an ethnicity or nationality to describe a behavior, to avoid situations like the one you're in.", "Question: Did you apologize to this person? \n\nYou said that if they reached out to you and told you it bothered them, you would have apologized to them. That would have been the better way for them to handle it instead of blowing up at you, but they did let you know that this phrase offended them. That put the ball in your court and now you could take initiative and apologize to them for using it.\n\nA lot of people on here are trying to arbitrate whether this is offensive or not, but that\u2019s not going to change your situation. It was offensive to them, and that\u2019s the root of the problem now.\n\nI have an anxiety disorder and I hate confrontation so I sympathize with you, but right now you\u2019re suffering in these meetings because of this person. Have you considered reaching out to them one on one and genuinely apologizing for hurting them (without excuses). Tell them that you aren\u2019t anti-Irish and you stuck your foot in your mouth, and you hope that you can move forward with them? Hopefully this will prompt them to apologize to you for their own shitty behavior.\n\nIf they continue to be cold to you, that\u2019s on them, and you did all you could. I\u2019m sorry. This sounds uncomfortable and I sympathize.", "If you don't speak up in public against some discriminatory speech then the other people in the chat will take it as an agreed fact that this kind of speech is OK. So this\n\n\n>What I think would have been better would be this person messaging me privately, saying that this phrase wasn't cool to them, and I would apologize and not use it anymore.\n\nIsn't really a good idea.\n\nBut having that said, it should be enough to mention it, for you to apologize and explain that you didn't know it was offensive, and the situation should have been cleared.\n\nFor them to hang on this long on something like this means probably that they are triggered by this... and that makes it their problem. And that  you are so triggered by their behavior is your problem. \n\n>The weirdest part of it all is that I've now heard the person speak, and they are not Irish.\n\nYou can't tell someone's origin by the way they speak. And being offended by any discriminatory speech can be a general thing. \n\nSooo... what you could do is to private message them and tell them that you are sorry for using this term, and tell them that you feel they are treating you differently and that it is bothering you. Be honest and sincere about it. That is probably the best way to solve this issue.", "NTA/slight ETH - The saying is kind of offensive and you should stop using it after being told so, however pretty much everyone uses words/sayings that are offensive and shouldn\u2019t be used because they just aren\u2019t aware. As long as you are willing to listen and adapt it\u2019s fine imo. \n\nMaking someone feel unwelcome and judging others in recovery meetings is way worse though and isn\u2019t proportionate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
