I have struggled with severe alcohol abuse for years and have finally found some peace from my addiction. I don\u2019t mind being around people drinking, but I hate being around drunks.\n\nSo the birthday party starts at her favorite bar at 4pm. All her girlfriends are there and soon enough they\u2019re all pretty intoxicated. I do my best to be cheerful and hold conversation with the group. My gf in particular has a tendency to yell when she\u2019s drunk. It annoys me, but hey, it\u2019s her day.\n\nAfter 4 hours of this, I see that everyone makes it to their respective Ubers and that the tab is completely paid with the bar (covering several drinks) and I tip them heavily to thank them for tolerating the large group of shrieking drunks.\n\nAt this point my gf\u2019s coworker suggests we go to another bar. Naturally I hate the idea, but it\u2019s her day. I drive us to second location where the celebration continues. Once this bar closes I\u2019m ready to go home but the ladies have now decided to go to a third bar. This time, I express that I am exhausted and would rather not. This is quickly dismissed, cus it\u2019s her day, and we drive to the third location.\n\nAt this point my gf is slurring badly, wobbly, and shouldn\u2019t be drinking more. I encourage her to have some water and food, meanwhile her friends buy her more shots. Eventually, our server asks the table if we could keep the volume down a bit. I must stress, the guy couldn\u2019t have been more polite about it. My gf on the other hand, took issue with this. She starts yelling \u201cwtf did he just say!?\u201d and her friend and coworker joined in on the indignation. At this point another server, a sweet older woman, drops off our check. The girls immediately start harassing her about being asked to quiet down.\n\nSome more context: every person in this group, including myself, works in service in some capacity. So with that in mind, I am personally ashamed to be part of the harassment the employees are receiving while politely doing their jobs. I asked my gf \u201ccould you just let it go, for me?\u201d But there was no dissuading her. As she laid into the server, I left the table and went outside. Eventually they made their way outside, where they saw the initial server working the door and laid into him again. I plead with her to let him be and that he was just doing his job. Eventually we drove home in silence. When we got home I expressed my frustration with her actions. She called me a pussy for not siding with her and said she deserved someone who would support her.\n\nNow I\u2019m writing this from the couch I\u2019m sleeping on.

That said, she is not (by my understanding) an alcoholic and tolerated my drinking for years.", "That\u2019s how I\u2019d normally handle it.

Whether it's a deal-breaker should be based on whether it's a *pattern* of behavior. \n\nIs she generally supportive of your sobriety, or does she complain about how \"you're different now \"\n\nDoes she only go out drinking once a year on her birthday? Probably no big deal. She just had one too many and got a little out of hand. She'll wake up with a headache and a bit of embarrassment and y'all can get to work planning a non-bar outing for next birthday. \n\nDid she tolerate your drinking for all those years because she was too drunk to notice the problem?... That does not bode well for the future.", "An understandable fear.  And you are absolutely NTA here.\n\nThere is no excuse for being rude to servers and staff, ever. If someone can't stay polite when drunk then they shouldn't be out in public after that many drinks.\n\nShe's right that as your girlfriend you should support her.  But 'support' doesn't mean backing her up no matter how much of an ass she is.  Sometimes the correct way to support a friend - or a girlfriend - is to tell them they're wrong, and when they're hurting innocent bystanders is exactly the time for that.\n\nYou did everything right.  The only apology owed is from her and her friends, to the staff they insulted.\n\nCongratulations on your six months.  Recovery is hard; well done!", "There are still times when I feel very ashamed with how I acted while in full blown alcoholism. You got this!

What could be more obnoxious than a loud bunch of drunks confronting a server? Who is only asking for other patrons to enjoy themselves too. \n\nCongratulations on your sobriety. Hitting three bars is not helpful. Please value your recovery as a measure of health. If she goes not support your health, what is the value of the relationship?", "NTA. Also, she has not right to kick you out of bed. If she's so angry, she can sleep on the couch.", "Maybe try having this conversation when she's sober.  NTA.  Your girlfriend & her friends do not sound like a group I would want to hang with even if I was drinking.  They sound obnoxious & embarrassing.  Which clearly they embarrassed you.  You may want to rethink this relationship bc it sounds like she's going to do what she wants regardless of your feelings.", "Definitely NTA! As someone who has battled alcoholism for years myself, I must first congratulate  you on your sobriety.  You are awesome!  Secondly, I have to commend you on your restraint, diplomacy, and courage in handling that situation.  It takes a lot to stand up for someone you don't know against someone you do.  That is true integrity !! It is sad that your girlfriend is 44 and acts like that.  She should be embarrassed and ashamed of herself.  I'm sorry that you have to put up with that , even if it is her birthday.  That does not excuse her behavior.  I might suggest you evaluate your relationship and have a serious discussion with her when she is sober . Dependent upon her reaction to the conversation, you should then decide on which way to go from there.  In the mean time, Keep up the great work on your sobriety and stay strong! You're doing great", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend and her friends however? Yeah that's where the assholes lie. I have ZERO TOLERANCE for belligerant drunks treating waitstaff abusively. ZERO. You were more of a rug than you needed to be though. You should have said no to the last bar. Her birthday or not. You didn't have to go through that when you were done.", "Dude. You deserve better. She has a problem. NTA.", "NTA\n\n\n\nCongratulations on sobriety. As someone who watched her father get on and off the wagon for years before finding real sobriety (and mental peace), I know how fragile that sobriety can be. I also know my dad felt suddenly very alone because ALL his friends were drinkers, and wouldn't not drink around him. So he was trying to kick a life long habit with no one to talk to besides his wife and AA people (and my dad is a private guy, opening up to strangers was extremely difficult).\n\n\n\nI include all this to say that I recognize new sobriety might be isolating and staying with your gf could be the easier choice that naturally comes with companionship. But like many others have said, she's a danger to your sobriety. Three bars in one night with a focus on partying, her getting so drunk she can't stand or speak properly, and all of her friends being just as sloshed is a LOT to ask you to deal with. My father can be around people who are drinking too, but again we keep it light and sober. That is, one two drinks per person over a few hours, and no one is even getting close to tipsy.\n\n\nYour gf and her friends were being wholly inappropriate. I mean, sure, when we were young and learning how to handle our booze, most of us have been way too drunk for our own good or the public's good. But she's 44, her friends/co-workers are probably somewhere in her age range, none of this \"too drunk to speak properly\" shit is cute. And yelling at the wait staff for making the reasonable request to quiet down is shitty behavior no matter how old anyone is.\n\n\n\nYou did nothing wrong, but your gf was an AH all night. Yes it was her birthday, but she should have had some consideration for you, as her bf, as someone maintaining their sobriety, and even as her designated driver. Her insults to you at the end of the night were the rotten cherry on a nasty cake. I'd seriously reconsider staying with this woman, even if you aren't sober, she treated you and the people serving her drinks like crap.", "Also, congrats on being 6 months sober \ud83c\udf89 it's a huge milestone and you should be proud of it.

Best of luck to you.", "You get the best out of the evening,", "I'm not going to advocate ending the relationship, but an important thing for all people in recovery when considering the SO that put up with their addiction all those years is: what are the SOs issues?

If your addiction developed after you were already together, what unhealthy patterns have they developed to cope with your addiction?", "Nta - also just because she \"tolerated\" your driving for years didn't mean you need to.

Don't promise to give anyone a ride home and make it clear you're leaving really early. A good excuse is that she deserves her time with her friends.

If I was the long-suffering girlfriend, who never *really* got to let my hair down and relax because I was constantly having to babysit an adult toddler, I can totally see the impulse to really cut loose on my b-day.  Like, it's finally my turn to be irresponsible. \n\nI've also seen relationships with a functional alcoholic and a (dysfunctional? Non-functional?) alcoholic where the more stable partner's very serious issues get hand- waved away because it's not THAT bad, but it's definitely bad enough to worry about.", "NTA - I'd be single after that. She's 44 years old. That's ridiculous to act that way at all.", "NTA - FIrst off, major congrats on your sobriety!! Truly.\n\nThat said... your gf seems like a mean belligerent drunk with zero self-awareness and you being forced into the sober driver role so that she can go out and terrorize people feels like you flogging yourself. Why are you tolerating this? Birthday or not, people don't act that way while drunk unless something inside of them already has that in it. After 4 yrs, is this what you want to put *yourself* through?\n\nIf she doesn't wake up profusely apologizing to you and reaching out to those bars to apologize, I'd be wanting to take a close hard look at who she is inside. There's simply no excuse.", "NTA\n\nShe should be your ex. She is toxic as fuck. \n\nMy father was Alcoholic and I grew up with everything this addiction throws at you.\n\nThere is no excuse for her actions. \n\nWhen people use \"I was drunk\" as an excuse, those people are gone from my orbit.

Being in recovery and tolerating such a situation is wow. I give you props, because I would have went home after the first bar. I also would say if when she wakes up sober and can't see your side, get out of there.\n\nThere is no excusable reason to be rude to service workers; if you're an adult in their 40's and being belligerent and disrespectful while intoxicated, you're a massive AH.

IF she is able to see herself in that light and work to make it right - hell, she doesn't need to stop drinking, she just needs to ease off (but stopping would be better in all honesty) - then you have a good chance.

Congrats on six months. \n\nEdit: forgot verdict, NTA even a bit.", "First congratulations on your sobriety. NTA, you need to get away from her and her drinking.  A big part of staying sober is to establish boundaries.  She guilted you into a situation that could have tempted you to drink. This would include not babysitting people while they got drunk.  Look for support in a group like AA.  Have a long talk with he about what happened and that you will no longer babysit her and her friends while they are getting drunk not matter what day it is.

This is why words like \"co-dependant\" exist. \n\nSomeone who is 44 years old and seeks to get shit faced drunk - and brings their recovering addict partner with them - that's messed up.

It helps them deny their own addiction when they can point to their partner and say, \u201cMy partner is the one with the substance abuse problem because they are worse than me.\u201d  My point is, the fact your drinking was worse doesn\u2019t mean your gf doesn\u2019t have a problem.  It may have been one of the reasons she tolerated your drinking.  Not saying your gf has a substance abuse issue, but you should look at that issue with fresh, sober eyes after you have been sober for longer.  No need to make dramatic changes to your life now.  \n\nAlso, don\u2019t argue or lecture people who are drunk.  It\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand.  You are not an ah, but you aren\u2019t going to win an argument with someone who is drunk.  Just try to get them home and safely in bed.  If you want to discuss the prior evening\u2019s behavior, do it when they are sober the next day.  \n\nHowever, it seems your gf is not usually like this, so perhaps you should let this one go.  What are you trying to accomplish by telling her that her behavior while she was intoxicated on her birthday was inappropriate?  Shame her?  Make you feel better?  Get an apology for what what someone did while drunk?  Having given out many of those myself, they are fairly meaningless.  I\u2019m sure you know that too.\n\nCongratulations on your 6-months.

Blessings on your continued efforts.", "Bro - you have nothing to feel ashamed about. At. All. You bent over backwards for your GF including putting yourself in a position that may not be beneficial to your recovery.\n\nI'm a security supervisor at a large resort and I agree with the person you replied to, we would have politely cut her off based on visible over-intoxication and kicked her out for rude behavior to staff. If she refused to leave immediately we would call the police for a tresspas citation. She's lucky things didn't go worse.\n\nBased on some of your other responses, it seems there are few possibilities coming up:\n\n1. This has never happened before and she wakes up and realizes she was TA. You have a discussion about how she treated the staff and how she treated you. She accepts she was wrong and it's onward and upward.\n\n2. This level of intoxication has happened before (regardless of what your level of intoxication may have been at the time) but she also recognizes she was TA. Then you still need to recognize there is some pattern of behavior that could be detrimental to your sobriety and you need to evaluate what is best for you and your sobriety moving forward.\n\n3. This level of intoxication has happened before and she thinks her behavior was fine. I'm not one of the typical \"dump them\" people here but you need to really, seriously think about how you will maintain sobriety with a partner who not only drinks to excess but also doesn't share some of the same values of human decency.\n\nBig congrats on your first 6 months, that's huge - keep it up and live a happy life!", "You chauffeured them around to three bars knowing full well you\u2019re in the process of recovery.

A 30+ year old could be in the same mental and life age versus a 20+ year old with a 10 year age gap. It's like how an 18 year old with a 28 year old is extremely different from a 38 year old and a 48 year old", "NTA. I've also struggled with drinking, sober eight years now. \n\nPlease break up with your girlfriend. Truly. When I quit drinking, my partner did, too, in solidarity.

A bad night doesn't have to mean a break up. I don't condone her actions but putting things into perspective is necessary.\n\nAs is well-known, drunk people are stupid. So a group of insanely drunk women, celebrating, egging each other on are definitely going to be stupid. This is coming from a chick who has gotten drunk and done stupid shit with her mates. It takes just one woman to misinterpret something and tell her friends who will escalate the scene.\n\nI think the bigger issue for you is surrounding your sobriety. Spousal influence in consumption behavior (drinking, smoking, binging etc.) is real and I think you need to take stock of how well you honestly think you can manage your sobriety if your partner will continue to drink around you. \n\nWarm regards.", "There\u2019s absolutely no arguing with a loud obnoxious drunk.
