I have struggled with severe alcohol abuse for years and have finally found some peace from my addiction. I don\u2019t mind being around people drinking, but I hate being around drunks.\n\nSo the birthday party starts at her favorite bar at 4pm. All her girlfriends are there and soon enough they\u2019re all pretty intoxicated. I do my best to be cheerful and hold conversation with the group. My gf in particular has a tendency to yell when she\u2019s drunk. It annoys me, but hey, it\u2019s her day.\n\nAfter 4 hours of this, I see that everyone makes it to their respective Ubers and that the tab is completely paid with the bar (covering several drinks) and I tip them heavily to thank them for tolerating the large group of shrieking drunks.\n\nAt this point my gf\u2019s coworker suggests we go to another bar. Naturally I hate the idea, but it\u2019s her day. I drive us to second location where the celebration continues. Once this bar closes I\u2019m ready to go home but the ladies have now decided to go to a third bar. This time, I express that I am exhausted and would rather not. This is quickly dismissed, cus it\u2019s her day, and we drive to the third location.\n\nAt this point my gf is slurring badly, wobbly, and shouldn\u2019t be drinking more. I encourage her to have some water and food, meanwhile her friends buy her more shots. Eventually, our server asks the table if we could keep the volume down a bit. I must stress, the guy couldn\u2019t have been more polite about it. My gf on the other hand, took issue with this. She starts yelling \u201cwtf did he just say!?\u201d and her friend and coworker joined in on the indignation. At this point another server, a sweet older woman, drops off our check. The girls immediately start harassing her about being asked to quiet down.\n\nSome more context: every person in this group, including myself, works in service in some capacity. So with that in mind, I am personally ashamed to be part of the harassment the employees are receiving while politely doing their jobs. I asked my gf \u201ccould you just let it go, for me?\u201d But there was no dissuading her. As she laid into the server, I left the table and went outside. Eventually they made their way outside, where they saw the initial server working the door and laid into him again. I plead with her to let him be and that he was just doing his job. Eventually we drove home in silence. When we got home I expressed my frustration with her actions. She called me a pussy for not siding with her and said she deserved someone who would support her.\n\nNow I\u2019m writing this from the couch I\u2019m sleeping on.

That said, she is not (by my understanding) an alcoholic and tolerated my drinking for years.", "That\u2019s how I\u2019d normally handle it. The birthday part made my presence feel obligatory.", "The ironic part is that her and the primary friend involved in the altercation are F&B managers. This is the type of behavior they would detest.

I haven\u2019t really stopped to feel proud yet, mostly still feel ashamed. The outpouring of support from everyone on my sobriety is moving.

You're definitely NTA and she definitely embarrassed herself last night.  Whether it's a deal-breaker should be based on whether it's a *pattern* of behavior. \n\nIs she generally supportive of your sobriety, or does she complain about how \"you're different now \"\n\nDoes she only go out drinking once a year on her birthday? Probably no big deal. She just had one too many and got a little out of hand. She'll wake up with a headache and a bit of embarrassment and y'all can get to work planning a non-bar outing for next birthday. \n\nDid she tolerate your drinking for all those years because she was too drunk to notice the problem?... That does not bode well for the future.", "An understandable fear.  And you are absolutely NTA here.\n\nThere is no excuse for being rude to servers and staff, ever. If someone can't stay polite when drunk then they shouldn't be out in public after that many drinks.\n\nShe's right that as your girlfriend you should support her.  But 'support' doesn't mean backing her up no matter how much of an ass she is.  Sometimes the correct way to support a friend - or a girlfriend - is to tell them they're wrong, and when they're hurting innocent bystanders is exactly the time for that.\n\nYou did everything right.  The only apology owed is from her and her friends, to the staff they insulted.\n\nCongratulations on your six months.  Recovery is hard; well done!", "There are still times when I feel very ashamed with how I acted while in full blown alcoholism. You got this! Don\u2019t let your gf and her friends/coworkers drag you down.

You know what drink can do to you, and you know that ame drinking is not an excuse.\n\nYou also know there is no resolution for any of this until Drunky McMuffin gets up tomorrow.\n\nI hope she wakes up with a huge apology for you.  Thanks for playing DD and trying to save that guy's night.", "NTA - When my boyfriend got sober, I stopped drinking for a couple of years, too. Not because I had to or because he asked me to. Because it was the right thing to do to support him. Although he eventually got to the point where he was comfortable being at a bar with me, it sure as hell wasn't only 6 months in. Your girlfriend is selfish, thoughtless, and ungrateful.", "NTA at all but your girlfriend absolutely is! \n\nI wouldn\u2019t never make someone who is a recovering alcoholic come and watch me get drunk with my friends, birthday or not, that just sounds selfish. I also can\u2019t stand people who are rude to service staff, it makes my blood boil! The fact she has the nerve to have a go at you for not \u2018supporting her\u2019 in her horrible behaviour is wild.", "Alcohol doesn\u2019t make you different.

Fast. At 44 she has zero excuse to be behaving like this towards servers.", "NTA Congratulations on your sobriety. Question: why would you want to be around someone who gets so drunk? You said yourself you hate being around drunks. Yes it's your gfs birthday but you should have taken care of you and just left.", "NTA.  I was a bartender for 13 years.  Your gf and her friends should have been cut off.  An obnoxious unruly drunk is repulsive.  For your sobriety's sake this relationship doesn't seem healthy for you.", "NTA.  And you might want to step back and take a hard look at your relationship.  In vino veritas.", "NTA,\n\nunless there is some contrition in the morning from the gf I would strongly consider if the relationship is healthy for you.\n\nGood luck", "NTA. I wish you would have recorded her behavior, and played it for her the next day.", "NTA.\n\nMy dude, this is dealbreaker territory.  This is 'one come to Jesus talk, and if there isn't honest, positive growth and change, she's not the woman for you' territory.", "NTA. What could be more obnoxious than a loud bunch of drunks confronting a server? Who is only asking for other patrons to enjoy themselves too. \n\nCongratulations on your sobriety. Hitting three bars is not helpful. Please value your recovery as a measure of health. If she goes not support your health, what is the value of the relationship?", "NTA. Also, she has not right to kick you out of bed. If she's so angry, she can sleep on the couch.", "Maybe try having this conversation when she's sober.  NTA.  Your girlfriend & her friends do not sound like a group I would want to hang with even if I was drinking.  They sound obnoxious & embarrassing.  Which clearly they embarrassed you.  You may want to rethink this relationship bc it sounds like she's going to do what she wants regardless of your feelings.", "Definitely NTA! As someone who has battled alcoholism for years myself, I must first congratulate  you on your sobriety.  You are awesome!  Secondly, I have to commend you on your restraint, diplomacy, and courage in handling that situation.  It takes a lot to stand up for someone you don't know against someone you do.  That is true integrity !! It is sad that your girlfriend is 44 and acts like that.  She should be embarrassed and ashamed of herself.  I'm sorry that you have to put up with that , even if it is her birthday.  That does not excuse her behavior.  I might suggest you evaluate your relationship and have a serious discussion with her when she is sober . Dependent upon her reaction to the conversation, you should then decide on which way to go from there.  In the mean time, Keep up the great work on your sobriety and stay strong! You're doing great", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend and her friends however? Yeah that's where the assholes lie. I have ZERO TOLERANCE for belligerant drunks treating waitstaff abusively. ZERO. You were more of a rug than you needed to be though. You should have said no to the last bar. Her birthday or not. You didn't have to go through that when you were done.", "Dude. You deserve better. She has a problem. NTA.", "NTA\n\n\n\nCongratulations on sobriety. As someone who watched her father get on and off the wagon for years before finding real sobriety (and mental peace), I know how fragile that sobriety can be. I also know my dad felt suddenly very alone because ALL his friends were drinkers, and wouldn't not drink around him. So he was trying to kick a life long habit with no one to talk to besides his wife and AA people (and my dad is a private guy, opening up to strangers was extremely difficult).\n\n\n\nI include all this to say that I recognize new sobriety might be isolating and staying with your gf could be the easier choice that naturally comes with companionship. But like many others have said, she's a danger to your sobriety. Three bars in one night with a focus on partying, her getting so drunk she can't stand or speak properly, and all of her friends being just as sloshed is a LOT to ask you to deal with. My father can be around people who are drinking too, but again we keep it light and sober. That is, one two drinks per person over a few hours, and no one is even getting close to tipsy.\n\n\nYour gf and her friends were being wholly inappropriate. I mean, sure, when we were young and learning how to handle our booze, most of us have been way too drunk for our own good or the public's good. But she's 44, her friends/co-workers are probably somewhere in her age range, none of this \"too drunk to speak properly\" shit is cute. And yelling at the wait staff for making the reasonable request to quiet down is shitty behavior no matter how old anyone is.\n\n\n\nYou did nothing wrong, but your gf was an AH all night. Yes it was her birthday, but she should have had some consideration for you, as her bf, as someone maintaining their sobriety, and even as her designated driver. Her insults to you at the end of the night were the rotten cherry on a nasty cake. I'd seriously reconsider staying with this woman, even if you aren't sober, she treated you and the people serving her drinks like crap.", "Also, congrats on being 6 months sober \ud83c\udf89 it's a huge milestone and you should be proud of it. Your girl does seem a bit narcissistic and toxic...remember, the antidote may taste bitter but it's better than poison. Best of luck to you.", "You get the best out of the evening,", "I'm not going to advocate ending the relationship, but an important thing for all people in recovery when considering the SO that put up with their addiction all those years is: what are the SOs issues? Why would they put up with you in your addiction?\nBecause if you were already active in your addiction when you met, well, healthy people aren't attracted to addicts. If your addiction developed after you were already together, what unhealthy patterns have they developed to cope with your addiction?", "Nta - also just because she \"tolerated\" your driving for years didn't mean you need to. It's not a contest and getting belligerently drunk because it's \"her day\" isn't an excuse.", "If there's a next time go along. Don't promise to give anyone a ride home and make it clear you're leaving really early. A good excuse is that she deserves her time with her friends. You get the best out of the evening, nice photos, good conversation & avoid the drunken behaviour. Just be confident about it, nobody will mind especially if you've already said you're leaving at 9 or something like that.", "Your presence was not obligatory hon. You should have been able to call it done when you were done. Hugs. I'm so proud of your sobriety. Keep it up!", "Pattern of lack of accountability is problematic.", "Then ask yourself if that is the person you want to be with if she feels that way?   \n\nAlso ask yourself if you want to be with someone who doesn't want to better themselves for you as you are doing for her.  This is not advice to break up with her but advice to work out the issues before it becomes more serious.", "If that's the reality you already know it's not acceptable.", "For me, it's really easy to see both sides of this one, because I've seen both IRL.  If I was the long-suffering girlfriend, who never *really* got to let my hair down and relax because I was constantly having to babysit an adult toddler, I can totally see the impulse to really cut loose on my b-day.  Like, it's finally my turn to be irresponsible. \n\nI've also seen relationships with a functional alcoholic and a (dysfunctional? Non-functional?) alcoholic where the more stable partner's very serious issues get hand- waved away because it's not THAT bad, but it's definitely bad enough to worry about."]}
