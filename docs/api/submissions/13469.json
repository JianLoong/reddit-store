I have struggled with severe alcohol abuse for years and have finally found some peace from my addiction. I don\u2019t mind being around people drinking, but I hate being around drunks.\n\nSo the birthday party starts at her favorite bar at 4pm. All her girlfriends are there and soon enough they\u2019re all pretty intoxicated. I do my best to be cheerful and hold conversation with the group. My gf in particular has a tendency to yell when she\u2019s drunk. It annoys me, but hey, it\u2019s her day.\n\nAfter 4 hours of this, I see that everyone makes it to their respective Ubers and that the tab is completely paid with the bar (covering several drinks) and I tip them heavily to thank them for tolerating the large group of shrieking drunks.\n\nAt this point my gf\u2019s coworker suggests we go to another bar. Naturally I hate the idea, but it\u2019s her day. I drive us to second location where the celebration continues. Once this bar closes I\u2019m ready to go home but the ladies have now decided to go to a third bar. This time, I express that I am exhausted and would rather not. This is quickly dismissed, cus it\u2019s her day, and we drive to the third location.\n\nAt this point my gf is slurring badly, wobbly, and shouldn\u2019t be drinking more. I encourage her to have some water and food, meanwhile her friends buy her more shots. Eventually, our server asks the table if we could keep the volume down a bit. I must stress, the guy couldn\u2019t have been more polite about it. My gf on the other hand, took issue with this. She starts yelling \u201cwtf did he just say!?\u201d and her friend and coworker joined in on the indignation. At this point another server, a sweet older woman, drops off our check. The girls immediately start harassing her about being asked to quiet down.\n\nSome more context: every person in this group, including myself, works in service in some capacity. So with that in mind, I am personally ashamed to be part of the harassment the employees are receiving while politely doing their jobs. I asked my gf \u201ccould you just let it go, for me?\u201d But there was no dissuading her. As she laid into the server, I left the table and went outside. Eventually they made their way outside, where they saw the initial server working the door and laid into him again. I plead with her to let him be and that he was just doing his job. Eventually we drove home in silence. When we got home I expressed my frustration with her actions. She called me a pussy for not siding with her and said she deserved someone who would support her.\n\nNow I\u2019m writing this from the couch I\u2019m sleeping on.

That said, she is not (by my understanding) an alcoholic and tolerated my drinking for years.", "That\u2019s how I\u2019d normally handle it.

Whether it's a deal-breaker should be based on whether it's a *pattern* of behavior. \n\nIs she generally supportive of your sobriety, or does she complain about how \"you're different now \"\n\nDoes she only go out drinking once a year on her birthday? Probably no big deal. She just had one too many and got a little out of hand. She'll wake up with a headache and a bit of embarrassment and y'all can get to work planning a non-bar outing for next birthday. \n\nDid she tolerate your drinking for all those years because she was too drunk to notice the problem?... That does not bode well for the future.", "An understandable fear.  And you are absolutely NTA here.\n\nThere is no excuse for being rude to servers and staff, ever. If someone can't stay polite when drunk then they shouldn't be out in public after that many drinks.\n\nShe's right that as your girlfriend you should support her.  But 'support' doesn't mean backing her up no matter how much of an ass she is.  Sometimes the correct way to support a friend - or a girlfriend - is to tell them they're wrong, and when they're hurting innocent bystanders is exactly the time for that.\n\nYou did everything right.  The only apology owed is from her and her friends, to the staff they insulted.\n\nCongratulations on your six months.  Recovery is hard; well done!", "There are still times when I feel very ashamed with how I acted while in full blown alcoholism. You got this!

What could be more obnoxious than a loud bunch of drunks confronting a server? Who is only asking for other patrons to enjoy themselves too. \n\nCongratulations on your sobriety. Hitting three bars is not helpful. Please value your recovery as a measure of health. If she goes not support your health, what is the value of the relationship?", "NTA. Also, she has not right to kick you out of bed. If she's so angry, she can sleep on the couch.", "Maybe try having this conversation when she's sober.  NTA.  Your girlfriend & her friends do not sound like a group I would want to hang with even if I was drinking.  They sound obnoxious & embarrassing.  Which clearly they embarrassed you.  You may want to rethink this relationship bc it sounds like she's going to do what she wants regardless of your feelings.", "Definitely NTA! As someone who has battled alcoholism for years myself, I must first congratulate  you on your sobriety.  You are awesome!  Secondly, I have to commend you on your restraint, diplomacy, and courage in handling that situation.  It takes a lot to stand up for someone you don't know against someone you do.  That is true integrity !! It is sad that your girlfriend is 44 and acts like that.  She should be embarrassed and ashamed of herself.  I'm sorry that you have to put up with that , even if it is her birthday.  That does not excuse her behavior.  I might suggest you evaluate your relationship and have a serious discussion with her when she is sober . Dependent upon her reaction to the conversation, you should then decide on which way to go from there.  In the mean time, Keep up the great work on your sobriety and stay strong! You're doing great", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend and her friends however? Yeah that's where the assholes lie. I have ZERO TOLERANCE for belligerant drunks treating waitstaff abusively. ZERO. You were more of a rug than you needed to be though. You should have said no to the last bar. Her birthday or not. You didn't have to go through that when you were done.", "Dude. You deserve better. She has a problem. NTA.", "NTA\n\n\n\nCongratulations on sobriety. As someone who watched her father get on and off the wagon for years before finding real sobriety (and mental peace), I know how fragile that sobriety can be. I also know my dad felt suddenly very alone because ALL his friends were drinkers, and wouldn't not drink around him. So he was trying to kick a life long habit with no one to talk to besides his wife and AA people (and my dad is a private guy, opening up to strangers was extremely difficult).\n\n\n\nI include all this to say that I recognize new sobriety might be isolating and staying with your gf could be the easier choice that naturally comes with companionship. But like many others have said, she's a danger to your sobriety. Three bars in one night with a focus on partying, her getting so drunk she can't stand or speak properly, and all of her friends being just as sloshed is a LOT to ask you to deal with. My father can be around people who are drinking too, but again we keep it light and sober. That is, one two drinks per person over a few hours, and no one is even getting close to tipsy.\n\n\nYour gf and her friends were being wholly inappropriate. I mean, sure, when we were young and learning how to handle our booze, most of us have been way too drunk for our own good or the public's good. But she's 44, her friends/co-workers are probably somewhere in her age range, none of this \"too drunk to speak properly\" shit is cute. And yelling at the wait staff for making the reasonable request to quiet down is shitty behavior no matter how old anyone is.\n\n\n\nYou did nothing wrong, but your gf was an AH all night. Yes it was her birthday, but she should have had some consideration for you, as her bf, as someone maintaining their sobriety, and even as her designated driver. Her insults to you at the end of the night were the rotten cherry on a nasty cake. I'd seriously reconsider staying with this woman, even if you aren't sober, she treated you and the people serving her drinks like crap.", "Also, congrats on being 6 months sober \ud83c\udf89 it's a huge milestone and you should be proud of it.

Best of luck to you.", "You get the best out of the evening,", "I'm not going to advocate ending the relationship, but an important thing for all people in recovery when considering the SO that put up with their addiction all those years is: what are the SOs issues?

If your addiction developed after you were already together, what unhealthy patterns have they developed to cope with your addiction?", "Nta - also just because she \"tolerated\" your driving for years didn't mean you need to. It's not a contest and getting belligerently drunk because it's \"her day\" isn't an excuse.", "If there's a next time go along. Don't promise to give anyone a ride home and make it clear you're leaving really early. A good excuse is that she deserves her time with her friends.

If I was the long-suffering girlfriend, who never *really* got to let my hair down and relax because I was constantly having to babysit an adult toddler, I can totally see the impulse to really cut loose on my b-day.  Like, it's finally my turn to be irresponsible. \n\nI've also seen relationships with a functional alcoholic and a (dysfunctional? Non-functional?) alcoholic where the more stable partner's very serious issues get hand- waved away because it's not THAT bad, but it's definitely bad enough to worry about.", "NTA - I'd be single after that. She's 44 years old. That's ridiculous to act that way at all.", "NTA - FIrst off, major congrats on your sobriety!! Truly.\n\nThat said... your gf seems like a mean belligerent drunk with zero self-awareness and you being forced into the sober driver role so that she can go out and terrorize people feels like you flogging yourself. Why are you tolerating this? Birthday or not, people don't act that way while drunk unless something inside of them already has that in it. After 4 yrs, is this what you want to put *yourself* through?\n\nIf she doesn't wake up profusely apologizing to you and reaching out to those bars to apologize, I'd be wanting to take a close hard look at who she is inside. There's simply no excuse.", "NTA\n\nShe should be your ex. She is toxic as fuck. \n\nMy father was Alcoholic and I grew up with everything this addiction throws at you.\n\nThere is no excuse for her actions. \n\nWhen people use \"I was drunk\" as an excuse, those people are gone from my orbit.

Being in recovery and tolerating such a situation is wow. I give you props, because I would have went home after the first bar. I also would say if when she wakes up sober and can't see your side, get out of there.\n\nThere is no excusable reason to be rude to service workers; if you're an adult in their 40's and being belligerent and disrespectful while intoxicated, you're a massive AH.

It's up to you to determine if that's acceptable for you.", "This relationship will end your sobriety...", "NTA\u2026.should have videotaped her and her friends.

IF she is able to see herself in that light and work to make it right - hell, she doesn't need to stop drinking, she just needs to ease off (but stopping would be better in all honesty) - then you have a good chance. If she fails to see her actions in their true light, then good luck OP... you know what you need to do for your sanity and your sobriety. \n\nLastly, great job on your sobriety OP.

Congrats on six months. \n\nEdit: forgot verdict, NTA even a bit.", "First congratulations on your sobriety. NTA, you need to get away from her and her drinking.  A big part of staying sober is to establish boundaries.  She guilted you into a situation that could have tempted you to drink. This would include not babysitting people while they got drunk.  Look for support in a group like AA.  Have a long talk with he about what happened and that you will no longer babysit her and her friends while they are getting drunk not matter what day it is.

Is she good for your recovery? Lots of good posts on here urging you to examine the relationship for your own good. Only you know the real answers to those questions.", "Nta, this would be such a huge turn off/ red flag to me. She's 44 and still drinking far more than she can handle. Is that really someone you want to be with?", "NTA, but do you seriously what to be with someone that gets that drunk knowing you are only 6 months sober? If you were my boyfriend I would have had you stay home if I was going to go drinking. Not as a punishment but as respect to not bring that around you.", "Oh man, NTA. Hopefully when she sobers up you can have a proper conversation with her but I'm not so sure it will go well. You probably missed a tooooon of red flags before you got sober because you both in it for the ride. My service industry friend was in a really co-dependent drug and alcohol fueled toxic relationship for 13 years. They even got engaged! Her fiances behavior eventually cost him his job (he bounced at the bar she worked at) and he couldn't keep down another and started living on her dime saying he now wants to draw comics. I stopped going to the bar as frequently after I got off my own shift as because they'd bicker in sometimes scary ways while I was there because she'd been taking shots with customers and he I guess got a bunch of freebies too. She finally decided enough was enough and once she got sober she realized how much of a deadbeat her boyfriend was and how unsupportive he'd been all those years. She's not only kicked him to the curb, but she also quit smoking and got her masters degree.\n\nIf your gf is amenable to an actual conversation about not acting a fool at 44 and people trying to cut her off for her own safety and not getting so drunk you take everything as a slight, more power to you. My experience with fellow service industry people is this: they drink to get fall down drunk and treat other service people poorly or they drink to get fall down drunk and are really happy to be there.", "ETA.

For your GF to insist that you comply with her desire to behave badly, that's her telling you to shut off all your humanity and just let her have her wants.  When such behavior becomes a pattern, it's emotional abuse.\n\nShe's wrong.  NTA.\n\nShe's wrong.

If my bf was a recovering alcoholic, i would most likely have either had a small celebration at home, or had gone out to a nice restaurant with him. I think she was already a bit inconsiderate to, within your first 6 months of sobriety, make you the chauffeur of the Drunk Chick Club. But again, this could be because of my bias. \nRegardless, they were loud, annoying and mean to servers. You had every right to call her out, imo. I hope that her response was out of drunkenness and she apologises in the morning, but even then, you'd have to ask yourself if you want to have to deal with her drunk self however often she goes out like that.

You can do better!", "I think I came off as harsher than I intended because I didn't really mean to give you a dressing-down for being in this relationship.

She's 44 years old! The scenario you described could be excused in your 20's. She's too old to be acting like that, and not knowing how to contain herself or her alcohol.
