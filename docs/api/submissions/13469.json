{"id": 13469, "submission_id": "125kv5d", "title": "AITA for defending our server?", "selftext": "I (m35) have been with my gf (f44) for four years and last night was her birthday celebration.\n\nFor context, I am a 6 months sober recovering alcoholic. I have struggled with severe alcohol abuse for years and have finally found some peace from my addiction. I don\u2019t mind being around people drinking, but I hate being around drunks.\n\nSo the birthday party starts at her favorite bar at 4pm. All her girlfriends are there and soon enough they\u2019re all pretty intoxicated. I do my best to be cheerful and hold conversation with the group. My gf in particular has a tendency to yell when she\u2019s drunk. It annoys me, but hey, it\u2019s her day.\n\nAfter 4 hours of this, I see that everyone makes it to their respective Ubers and that the tab is completely paid with the bar (covering several drinks) and I tip them heavily to thank them for tolerating the large group of shrieking drunks.\n\nAt this point my gf\u2019s coworker suggests we go to another bar. Naturally I hate the idea, but it\u2019s her day. I drive us to second location where the celebration continues. Once this bar closes I\u2019m ready to go home but the ladies have now decided to go to a third bar. This time, I express that I am exhausted and would rather not. This is quickly dismissed, cus it\u2019s her day, and we drive to the third location.\n\nAt this point my gf is slurring badly, wobbly, and shouldn\u2019t be drinking more. I encourage her to have some water and food, meanwhile her friends buy her more shots. Eventually, our server asks the table if we could keep the volume down a bit. I must stress, the guy couldn\u2019t have been more polite about it. My gf on the other hand, took issue with this. She starts yelling \u201cwtf did he just say!?\u201d and her friend and coworker joined in on the indignation. At this point another server, a sweet older woman, drops off our check. The girls immediately start harassing her about being asked to quiet down.\n\nSome more context: every person in this group, including myself, works in service in some capacity. So with that in mind, I am personally ashamed to be part of the harassment the employees are receiving while politely doing their jobs. I asked my gf \u201ccould you just let it go, for me?\u201d But there was no dissuading her. As she laid into the server, I left the table and went outside. Eventually they made their way outside, where they saw the initial server working the door and laid into him again. I plead with her to let him be and that he was just doing his job. Eventually we drove home in silence. When we got home I expressed my frustration with her actions. She called me a pussy for not siding with her and said she deserved someone who would support her.\n\nNow I\u2019m writing this from the couch I\u2019m sleeping on.

Which is amazing, and requires so much effort and self-disipline, something you can be really proud of! Meanwhile, your gf drags you to several bars where you have to watch her and her friends get drunk. That's about the least supportive thing she can do, besides maybe shoving drinks directly down your throat. \n\nHonestly, anyone with a shred of empathy would have at the very least not dragged you along on their drunken bender. \n\nIt really worries me that she put you in that position.

I just drink consistently though the day to keep the shakes away.i don't get \"loser drunk\" anymore. Anyways. Your party was\" loser drunk\", you knew that and you should have just went to the server and told them to be cut off. So kinda ta for not. And at the same time the bar should have cut them off anyways without being told to do so. My gf doesn't drink so a drinker and a non drinker can work. But you have to have a line. Anyways good luck!

Solid NTA OP, and congrats on 6 months! That\u2019s huge, keep it up!", "Fair point. That said, she is not (by my understanding) an alcoholic and tolerated my drinking for years.", "That\u2019s how I\u2019d normally handle it. The birthday part made my presence feel obligatory.", "The ironic part is that her and the primary friend involved in the altercation are F&B managers. This is the type of behavior they would detest. But I seriously doubt either one will admit fault.", "My fear is that there is no apology, and she stands by her actions.", "Hey thank you. I haven\u2019t really stopped to feel proud yet, mostly still feel ashamed. The outpouring of support from everyone on my sobriety is moving. Thank you all.", "Lmao I\u2019d never defend those servers, especially COD\u2019s.", "That certainly would have taken the heat off the server lol.", "Thank you.", "AITA loves to tell everyone to break up over a bad day. You're definitely NTA and she definitely embarrassed herself last night.  Whether it's a deal-breaker should be based on whether it's a *pattern* of behavior. \n\nIs she generally supportive of your sobriety, or does she complain about how \"you're different now \"\n\nDoes she only go out drinking once a year on her birthday? Probably no big deal. She just had one too many and got a little out of hand. She'll wake up with a headache and a bit of embarrassment and y'all can get to work planning a non-bar outing for next birthday. \n\nDid she tolerate your drinking for all those years because she was too drunk to notice the problem?... That does not bode well for the future.", "An understandable fear.  And you are absolutely NTA here.\n\nThere is no excuse for being rude to servers and staff, ever. If someone can't stay polite when drunk then they shouldn't be out in public after that many drinks.\n\nShe's right that as your girlfriend you should support her.  But 'support' doesn't mean backing her up no matter how much of an ass she is.  Sometimes the correct way to support a friend - or a girlfriend - is to tell them they're wrong, and when they're hurting innocent bystanders is exactly the time for that.\n\nYou did everything right.  The only apology owed is from her and her friends, to the staff they insulted.\n\nCongratulations on your six months.  Recovery is hard; well done!", "There are still times when I feel very ashamed with how I acted while in full blown alcoholism. You got this! Don\u2019t let your gf and her friends/coworkers drag you down. If you feel like you\u2019re sinking go to a meeting, meet with a sober friend and of course when the time is right find yourself a trusted mentor. Those have helped me a lot.", "I was thinking while reading, ok when they get home to play and fuck up the server!
