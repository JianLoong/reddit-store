Then again, maybe I was just delusional in thinking that would be the right choice.", "Unfortunately no, I do not believe my sister will be getting married anytime soon but without a doubt i know she would ask my father to walk her down the isle. I failed to mention in my original post (due to character limit) that my sister had made amends with my father long ago. While this hurt me deeply my sister needed me during a very tough time and I couldnt sit there and not be there for her.\n\nI dont believe there is any other angle other than my father trying to appease his wife, she relishes the fact that im the black sheep and wishes for it to stay that way.", "Your father is extremely dangerous.

He should never have been allowed around you.\n\nWith a grandfather like this, the only happy story for your children, is never having to know him. It\u2019s terrible your father is so horrible and you deserved better as a child. And your children will deserve better too. Your gift to them is a life free of this loathsome man.", "You make a seriously good point. It very much could've ruined my life. My father had already told his tale to his side of the family by the time i was able to reach out to my cousins and some of them believed me, some of them said i was disgusting and should be ashamed of myself. \n\nAs i said previously I was very delusional about this entire situation and was desperate to establish **some** kind of relationship with him as he is my only bio father i will ever have. To think I was willing to introduce him to my potential children sends chills down my spine though. If my SM wished to she could concoct some tale about them and I'm sure my father would be on her side the whole time."]}
