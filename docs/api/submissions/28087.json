For clarification purposes I was 13 and she was 12 during this time.  \n\n\nTony was never deployed to Iraq at that time, but instead went to Brazil to marry Alannah and invited his entire family, except for his two children. We didn't even find it out from him but from a Facebook post made by my Aunt about the wedding. Cait demanded to know why he lied about the wedding and why Ann and I were excluded from the event entirely. Tony then says that I \"sexually harassed Alannah\" and that there was proof. Whenever Cait or I would ask Tony for the proof he would say that  he did not need to show the evidence since his word should be enough.  \n\n\nWe stopped talking for a while then, the first 10 years was no contact but after I turned 22 we spoke  on and off until last month. He had called me and asked why I didn't reach out to him more often and after I told him that I was not interested in a one sided relationship again he goes off calling me a fucking asshole for not wanting to fix what i apparently ruined and told me that I needed to fucking apologize to Alannah.  \n\n\nAITA?

You need love OP, not any of those extravagant gifts. You dont need him in your life, but he needs you. He needs you to salute him, to cheer him up, so he can feel big. But he is not the dad that helps you to feel big, too. No, he makes himself big by making you small. \n\nLook, you did not ruin anything, (well, you ruined it FOR HIM, but thats a different story).

I was 13 at the time and god no I did not actually do it. The things that I were accused of saying were so vile that I do not feel comfortable sharing on here. The main two reasons why I still wanted a relationship was that at the end of the day, he is my father and I do miss who I thought he was and that if I were to ever have children I would want them to have a relationship with their grandfather. I admit I was incredibly naive in thinking a person like that was capable of change and accountability", "To accuse a 13 year old of sexual harassment is disgusting.  I get why you want your father but the sad fact is that you have a version of him that does not exist.  Be honest, do you think he is going to be a better human being with your future kids than he was with you and your sister.  I\u2019m guessing it wouldn\u2019t be too long before he insults and disappoints.  Your view is not wrong, it is a one sided relationship and at end of the day as much as you want a dad he has proven that he is not it.  :(", "To be entirely honest, no I do not believe he would be a better human being with my future kids but of course I was delusional in thinking \"Maybe he would be better with my kids than he was with me\" I'm a big advocate of allowing children to form their own opinion on people before they are written off but I will be making a huge exception with Tony. As much as it hurts to say the version I believed him to be never existed", "Sorry OP.  Leave the door ajar but set your boundaries in the future.  He will come back at some point."]}
