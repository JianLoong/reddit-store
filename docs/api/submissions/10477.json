You\u2019re NTA for giving your children a place to stay but not letting their mother (who has been outspokenly racist towards your wife and daughter who I\u2019m assuming live with you) stay there.

Thank goodness you can provide refuge for your children.", "ESH, you sound toxic as hell. Maybe there's a reason why she tried to get herself and your shared children away from you in another state. You are certainly trying to estrange your children from her. I hope you fail.", "Already trying to work on that. The police told me when i go to court the kids can pick who they go with im afraid my 14 year old will go with his mother and be struggling.", "This. Your ex's hateful rhetoric and mindset aside, it's best not to give her any ground to stand on.

I rather go to jail than have both of my children sleeping in a car", "Your as stupid as her", "Lol", "That's not entirely true. The children can have a say in where they go but the judge will rule in what's best for the child and I don't see any judge thinking it's a good idea to rule a child go live in a car with their mother over being provided for with their father.", "IANAL but the judge may not allow it if she doesn\u2019t have a place to live. Get your kids family counseling. It sounds like they need it.", "Will take a few weeks to sort things out - might be worth getting both minors therapy because all this has to be majorly distressing for them. Then both children have a better chance of making an informed decision of where to stay.  But NTA as responsibility to children not ex and they needed safe place. The ex would have made the place unsafe at least verbally for youngest.", "Your 14 year old got his whole life thrown over, and told that you are the bad guy.

Maybe if you cared more you wouldn't have to come on to reddit with your issues.", "Nta \n\nJust please get your children therapy. Don\u2019t let them go at it. If not therapy there are counsellors and other resources maybe.\n\nGet yourself therapy too. I can\u2019t judge how your ex is (sounds bad enough), but you do need to work through your feelings and learn how to cope and manage things - for your kids\u2019 sakes. Don\u2019t brush over this, beyond custody and court.", "NTA but, yes, go to court! Get this all documented! Protect the kids and yourself through legal avenues! You got this!", "NTA. Keep fighting for your kids", "I feel like some info is missing- who has custody now? The police generally do not intervene in civil matters.  They look at custody paperwork and return the children to whichever parent who is custody.  The other parent has to file in family court to change custody.  It may not be right, but that is how it works.  A persons financial means don\u2019t always immediately remove a child from their care.  The judge decides whether the child is better off with which parent.  Just because someone is poor doesn\u2019t mean they are a bad parent.  How was she able to move states without your approval? My guess is she has full custody.  That is difficult to obtain and will be difficult to remove.", "NTA but if he getting legal advice to keep them with you! She sounds very unpleasant", "NTA", "NTA It's karma", "Immediately call an attorney for legal advice on this subject. You want to make sure to dot your i's and cross your t's.\n\nGet both boys in therapy and do family therapy.\n\nAs for your ex... she needs to rethink her life choices in a major way but that is not your problem.", "NTA but you need to make sure that all your actions are in the best interests of your sons and not to spite your ex.

I have them more than her i have week days she has weekends.", "Oh wow yeah OP is so toxic for not letting the woman who called his wife the N word and thier daughter a mutt, live in his house. How awful that he won't let a racist live with his family.", "Yeah you're probably a racist", "Also if you live in California, you can make it a requirement that they not leave the state without your permission even if she does get primary custody. \n\nFor your own state, you should look into that at the very least.", "In my experience states really don\u2019t like when one parent moves their children across state lines against the wishes of the other parent.", "If that's true; let him choose her. See how long it takes for him to realize living with you is better than sleeping in the streets.", "NTA and iirc in some states, the child can\u2019t legally make a choice if they\u2019re under 16. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s still true or if/what states. Regardless, like others said, the judge is going to pick what is best for the kids - which isn\u2019t homeless.", "Then you need to explain to your older children exactly what was said. Tell them you do not know if that is still their mother's attitude but the fact that it was even said once means that she is not a safe person to be around your wife or your daughter and you are sure they understand that.\n\nEven if their mom is a flaming racist, it they've been in public school they at least understand how bad what she has said is and how devestating that would be to have her living in their house.\n\nHard NTA", "Yes, and OP, by the way, NTA.  You would totally be the AH to your wife and daughter if you let your racist vicious EX wife move in with you!", "Courts can\u2019t take away your kids just because you are poor.  If they are in some kind of specific clearly identifiable danger, yes.  But being homeless is not a crime and not something they take away kids for.", "Sad that shit suck.", "It's not taking them away, it's allowing the other parent temporary custody. It's not like they're going into foster care.", "Not much you could do about except letting your son know you have a place for him always.  Sounds chaotic and scary for him, so having a calm loving invite to a safe place might be exactly what he needs once he realizes he can\u2019t be caretaker for his mother. He might think he needs to protect no matter where she lives.  Does he know that\u2019s not his job?", "At the very least the kid should probably have some individual therapy for a bit to process and work through everything!", "What reason did the judge give?", "Probably what most judges say he-man she woman woman more important parent", "Then why are you on the subreddit people come here for advice why are you shaming him for that you're supposed to help people in their situations but now you're just being an ass"]}
