There\u2019s multiple factors that play into this, but we have two main reasons as to making the decision. The first reason was because we opted to have a child-friendly wedding, since we wanted my 6 year old nephew and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s 5 year old niece to be involved in the party, and it was either we have no children or no alcohol at the wedding. The second reason, and most important, is because a lot of our family members, especially on my side, are recovering alcoholics, and they get easily influenced by parties and events. \n\nWhen my fianc\u00e9 and I mentioned the reception to our families, his side of the family were understanding of our decision. However, my side of the family were split on it. A lot of my family members, especially my older cousin (34f) and her side of the family. She complained that the wedding would be boring without a bar and that \u201calcohol would make it more fun\u201d. I reminded my cousin of our relatives who are recovering addicts, such as our grandfather and our uncle, and the fact that I\u2019m willing to have a child-friendly wedding so she can be able to bring her kids and involve them in the event. She said that she planned a babysitter because she knew that \u201cI would never allow children anyways\u201d, and that I should sneak in something for the sake of it. I told her that I\u2019m not going to change the rules, and my cousin and her family started calling me boring and an AH for being inconsiderate. \n\nNow a lot of my family members, such as my cousin and her family, and some aunts and uncles are calling me inconsiderate and boring for not allowing alcohol at my wedding, and some members even pulled out of the wedding, telling me that they\u2019re \u201csaving themselves from my boring ass wedding\u201d. While my other family members, such as my parents, my siblings and their families, and my grandparents, are on my side and currently fighting with the family members that disagree. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I talked privately and we\u2019re still set on having no alcohol at the wedding, however my consciousness is telling me to think otherwise because the \u201cno alcohol rule\u201d is causing a strain in my family\u2019s relationship with each other. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673419418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108y092/aita_for_sticking_with_having_an_alcoholfree/", "score": 254, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How pathetic that some people can't carve out three or four hours of their entire life without including alcohol.

It's lovely you're considering the kids but it's the weaker argument because many a family event has taken place with both alcohol and kids and turned out fine. Most weddings, in fact.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't understand the logic if someone said there was no alcohol at a party because 2 kids would be there.

You don\u2019t have to have alcohol at your wedding if you don\u2019t want to. Where I live most weddings are small and family and close friends only, then the couple has a big reception that evening where you invite pretty much everyone you or your family knows. You don\u2019t serve dinner, just cake and punch with some mints or nuts sometimes and not a drop of alcohol in sight. I\u2019ve enjoyed most of the wedding receptions I\u2019ve attended and taken the opportunity to catch up with old friends I haven\u2019t seen for a while.

You\u2019re getting married so you get to decide what you will and won\u2019t do and what you will and won\u2019t serve. If you wanted a vegan or gluten free menu for your wedding or if you don\u2019t want to do a full meal that\u2019s up to you too. You can make a point of doing your wedding between meal times and just serve light refreshments and no alcoholic beverages if that\u2019s what you decide to do. You can break any of these supposed rules others have about how to do your wedding and your guests can live with it or stay home.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice.

I, too, have a lot of alcoholics on both sides of my family, and if they can't go a few hours without having a drink then they have bigger issues than just being bored at your wedding.\n\nYou can tell them that an invitation isn't a summons and they're free to not come. It'd be better without them raining on your parade.", "NTA. I drink socially but do not NEED it to have fun. If your family believes they NEED alcohol in order to have fun then they\u2019ve got problems. Let them not come to the wedding.

Are there teens you worry will sneak alcohol?", "NTA\nI recently got into a thing about the procedures re alcohol at weddings, basically a guy who doesn't drink wanted to have a cash bar and I said that's tacky as fuck and if you don't want to pay for alcohol have a dry wedding. That's what you're doing. If other people don't like it they can fuck off. Also it's worth noting that flasks exist lol", "I love a drink, with buddies or on my own. That said, it's YOUR day, your rules. Can't they go a damn day without?", "NTA but I agree that you should consider having a brunch type wedding. It creates less expectations and elss temptations.  Most people expect alcohol because that's what they are used to especially for an evening event. They are used to having it for a night party hence will have a hard timd letting loose without and having fun. \n\nRegardless,  have your wedding and if they pull out that's ok. Send an invitation with a firm rsvp abd if they don't rsvp or rsvp no then just think of it as cash saving! You dont need to fight and tell your immediate family to stop fighting with them.
