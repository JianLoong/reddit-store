Because of this, we have opted for a dry wedding. We also are asking our guests to not bring their own alcohol either.\n\nBecause of our pasts with substance abuse, I get nervous around alcohol because I want to keep myself in check but it causes me a lot of anxiety to know there's alcohol around.\n\nSome of my family is really pressed about this request and they are mad and saying that I'm trying to tell them they can't have a good time. I get they wanna have fun but being surrounded by drunk people at my wedding doesn't sound fun to me. To be clear, I never said they couldn't go out and drink before the reception starts.

Your wedding is your day and people should understand that.

Im sorry you have to question if yta. Because you are so clearly not.", "NTA- it\u2019s your wedding and your comfort is the biggest priority.

Enjoy it!", "NTA - your wedding, your rules. Interesting because I always believe people who get upset about dry events are closet alcoholics. So what, no booze for a night? Why is that hard? Hard if you are an addict \u2026 Would you say the people most loudly protesting have substance issues?? Or super old fashioned and tied to customs like toasting to speeches, etc?", "NTA\n\nYou are in recovery, and will be for the rest of your life.  Your family should support your recovery.\n\nIf they honestly believe that they need to drink to have a good time, then they probably also have a alcohol problem.", "NTA. And if they literally cannot have a time without alcohol, they may have their own problems with alcohol.", "NTA. Enjoy YOUR wedding.", "NTA. Im an alcoholic mid relapse. I would both appreciate and respect a dry wedding and even a dry reception.  You're totally okay to enforce an alcohol free event", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and your reasons are more than valid. I would hope family would be understanding given you\u2019re both in recovery. Family can either honor having a sober wedding or prioritize their alcohol consumption and not attend. They\u2019ll get over it and if they don\u2019t, at least you know who is supporting your sobriety.\n\nCongrats on the wedding and sobriety.

I think a dry wedding is better than a cash bar wedding, amiright?", "NTA\n\nAs you well know, addicts will chose their addictions over their family.

You can most definitely have fun at a dry wedding. My husband and I had a dry wedding due to it being at my childhood Church and not one person complained. Everyone enjoyed themselves. If they have that big of a problem with it then they can just stay home. Doesn't matter your reasonings for wanting a dry wedding.", "NTA. I\u2019d opt for something on the invitations explaining that your celebrating your sobriety, etc. and it will be a dry wedding.", ">they are mad and saying that I'm trying to tell them they can't have a good time. \n\nHonestly, if someone finds themselves getting *mad* over something like a dry wedding, they really need to re-evaluate their own relationship with alcohol. While it's unfortunately not uncommon for people to think dry weddings are less fun, they still shouldn't be getting mad about it or claim they can't have fun without alcohol.\n\nYou do what's best for you. A sober wedding is perfectly fine, and you should be proud of yourself for making decisions based on what is best for you and your partner. There is nothing wrong with a dry wedding, don't let anyone else convince you otherwise. NTA.", "NTA. If they can't have a good time at *a wedding* without getting lubricated, then they probably need the same recovery program you did.\n\nIt's your wedding and you get to set the rules.

If you can\u2019t enjoy a wedding without alcohol, you have a problem. I drink sometimes. I\u2019ve been to two dry weddings. They were dry for religious reasons- I don\u2019t belong to that religion. Guess what? I had a great time at both!", "NTA.  Your wedding, you decide if alcohol is allowed or not.", "NTA\nIt's your wedding and you need to be comfortable\nonly you know the struggle to overcome an addiction.\n\nNo one's gonna die because there's no alcohol at the party.", "Say dry wedding on the invite and go as fast as having security at the door and make sure no one brings in alcohol. The people that scream the loudest about it are most likely to bring in a flask or a bottle of their own. You have the absolute right to put your sobriety first, you wouldn't have the wedding without that sobriety.

Don't hassle people who want to leave early though.\n\nIt's not a matter of \"needing to drink\" because they're alcoholics necessarily. Weddings can be pretty boring events in a lot of ways.", "NAH as long as you tell them in advance so they can decide if they want to go or not. I have maybe one drink a week normally and I would still not want to go to a dry wedding. I went to one and was so bored I swore I would never do that again.", "I wouldn't choose to have a fancy dinner without a glass of wine. There just aren't any non-alcoholic drinks that occupy the right sort of flavor profile. So if you choose not to provide wine, it will make the dinner worse for me. \n\nBut that's OK. It doesn't have to be my perfect dinner. \n\n(I also wouldn't choose to go out and have a few drinks before dinner, in order to make sure I hit my alcohol quota for the night. That just sounds like a bizarre thing to do. Perhaps you don't get that, because you are/were a drunk, and drinking for you was all about getting drunk, but that doesn't describe everyone's relationship with alcohol.)\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've also been to a brunch wedding that did serve mimosas with the meal (I think it was 2 per person), and no other booze that was also actually pretty enjoyable, and would have been just as nice without the 2 mimosas (I didn't have them anyways, I'm not big on booze with breakfast). \n\nNTA for having a dry wedding regardless, but if you haven't figured out the plan yet you may want to consider a daytime wedding to minimize the pushback on not offering alcohol.", "Straight up, exactly."]}
