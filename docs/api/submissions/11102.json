It will be a day of extremes, beginning with anticipation and great excitement mingled with a certain amount of stress and overwhelm that culminates into joy, relief and to some degree a releasing sense of lighthearted frivolity. Your defenses will be down, the temptation could be overwhelming and overpowering, and the results could be disastrous.

Those who prioritize their desire to drink above your recovery needs will quite likely be your downfall, that will be inevitable once you begin to entertain the prioritization of their desires over your needs during recovery.

And this is not an unreasonable rule.\n\nHave you set the time yet? Consider earlier in the day - it makes a lot less sense to get drunk at 2 in the afternoon. And that will leave them the evening to do as they please....", "NTA- I don\u2019t understand why people think they can only have fun when drinking. Most weddings I\u2019ve been to have had no alcohol or low consumption and I\u2019ve had a great time. \n\nTheir dependence on alcohol to have fun is concerning.", "Kudos to you in your pass and present efforts in staying clean, your wedding your rules", "NTA. I went to a wedding where there was no alcohol. They passed out lukewarm flavored sparkling water. Not even cold. \n  I would suggest do something nice where drinks are involved. Mock tails are really nice but at the very least please have the Martinellis on ice and the sodas cold. \nAlso try a couple of nice chalkboard type message boards saying something like \u201cwelcome to our dry wedding. As recovering addicts we appreciate your support in our recovery and thank you for being a part of our journey through life\u201d.  Really lay it on thick. \n  As a sober musician in LA I have come to find that the ones who throw a fit over the X\u2019s on my hands don\u2019t matter. And those who matter don\u2019t throw a fit.", "NTA. Honestly op see the ones that are complaining and start uninviting them. The biggest problem is that those people don't take your health and safety into consideration or your fiance's. If I went to a former addicts wedding I wouldn't drink for 2 weeks beforehand just to ensure I don't trigger anything. I have a friend who is recovering and our entire friend group gave up alcohol in it's entirety just out of solidarity and to help her recover. This isn't a small matter. Please be careful around these people because they clearly don't care about your wellbeing, at least not enough to not push their wishes on you despite the danger it poses to you.", "NTA for three reasons: \n\n1. Your and your partner's health is more important than the wishes of your guests and being around alcohol not only risks it by increasing the risk of a relapse but also harms your mental health by distressing you. \n\n2. Your wedding should be about the couple being happy, not about making them unhappy to fullfil unreasonable requests of their guests.\n\n3. You don't need alcohol to have a good wedding \n\nWith your family's need for alcohol to have fun it's not surprising that you suffer from addiction and highly likely several of them do as well.", "It's more if they HAVE to. \n\nIf you CAN'T/WON'T go to an event because there's no alcohol, there's a problem.\n\nIf you drink alcohol at an event with alcohol permitted, no problem.\n\nI enjoy drinking in social settings because I get super duper anxious, and it helps dull that a little. But I wouldn't complain if the social setting I attended had no alcohol allowed. \n\nI hope this makes sense.", "NTA\n\nanyone complaining about this has their own alcohol dependency issues", "**NTA**\n\nIt's your wedding, your rules. The family members that don't like it don't have to attend and will save you even more money without having them there. Don't feel bad. If they need to drink to have a good time, then there's something really wrong with them.", "Nta its you and your husband's day to celebrate with your family and feel special. It wont feel special if you are worrying about your sobriety which your family should be supportive of", "NTA and the family members who are unable to enjoy a day without alcohol may have a bigger problem then you\u2026", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding not theirs. If they are this pressed about drinking they don\u2019t need to come. The fact they can\u2019t go a few hours without it out of respect for you and your husband as recovering addicts says a lot.", "NTA - usally i dont like the idea of dry weddings BUT you two are both recovered addicts and and i understand that it would be difficult for you if your guests were drinken. \n\nMy Opinion on that: If some of the family members wont understand what that means to you and your fiance maybe they shouldnt come to your wedding.", "Yta for trying to tell others what drinks they may or may not consume. Your wedding will be dry and forgetful", "NTA\n\nIt's not YOUR fault people apparently 'can't have fun' without alcohol.\n\nHow much of a loss would it be if you very nicely told them that your wedding is alcohol free, and if that's a problem for them they don't have to come. And look them dead in the eye when you get to the  'if that's a problem for you' bit.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding, and on getting yourselves out of your former addictions.", "If your family need alcohol in order to survive one party, that says something about them. \n\nYou are NTA. Congratulations to you both, and keep standing up for yourselves.", "NTA. In fact if your relatives are kicking up a fuss about no alcohol at your wedding it sounds to me like their relationship with alcohol is more problematic than yours.", "NTA - as long as everyone knows in advance", "NTA.\n\nIt's your wedding, you don't need a good reason but that's a good reason. Anyone making a stink about it, well they can go to hell for trying to make a wedding about them. They don't like it? Don't come.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to pick a venue that doesn't allow alcohol. I got married at an Amish Smorgasbord.", "Whoops, I commented without even looking at the comments. I basically just said what you said. lol. Sorry mate.", "Depends on if it was known in advance lol nothing worse than showing up to a wedding reception then finding out it's a cash bar lol"]}
