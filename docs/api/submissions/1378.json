Said brother is currently playing up big time.\n\nHe\u2019s broken our xbox controller, cut up our drawers, stabbed our mattress, stole our old vapes and ripped them apart which resulted in vape juice covering everything, including the clothes for our soon to be born son. He stole money from us that we were saving, smashed my $300-$400 lego sets, stole a couple of buds we had hidden away, old food and spoiled milk all over the floor and b0ng water all over the wall.\n\nWhen we were about to leave. his brother just got home from school, my partner, myself and my dad proceeded to yell at him for destroying our belongings and making a mess.\n\nMy partner then proceeded to get phone calls for hours from his family yelling at him and threatening him for us yelling at his brother. All of them are defending his brother disregarding what he did to our personal belongings. We\u2019re being made out to be the bad guys for it when his parents weren\u2019t going to discipline him, they never do. He gets away with everything and blames his ADHD and tablets.

That is going way too far. \nBut in all seriousness, yeah, NTA. It sounds like you didn\u2019t even know he was in there until you got back. And by what I\u2019ve read, he became the Tasmanian Devil. From experience with having ADHD, that doesn\u2019t cause someone to do what he\u2019s done.

Or did the 15 year old bring it in from elsewhere ??  Am really surprised u left $$ there too ... seems a bit careless but no judgement because being pregnant can mess with straight thinking.
