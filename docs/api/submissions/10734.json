The issue arises in that he wants to bring it to my house when I host hangouts/parties.  I'm not much of a dog person and really don't want it at my house.  It is a breed that sheds and I don't want to have to deal with dog hair in my house.  Also my kids regularly play in our yard and I don't want them to encounter dog poop and pee. \n\nI've spend the last 10 years in this house turning it into a place my friends, family and I could hang out.  I have a pool, I built a bar in my basement, those types of upgrades.  I offered to meet out at a restaurant or someone else's place and host less, but my house is the preferred destination among everyone else.  I have amenities that others don't and there are no expensive food and bar tabs at my place.  I host a lot during football season and other major sporting events, with some general hangouts in between.\n\nI told my friend that his dog wasn't welcome.  I offered to pay for a monitoring device he can use while at my house, but he didn't take that offer well.  He let me know he wasn't happy and recently missed our Super Bowl get together.

If you wouldn't deny a wheel chair user or someone with an oxygen tank into your home, you shouldn't deny the dog either. Ask that the friend makes sure the dog is well groomed/brushed before coming over to not worry about shedding as much. \n\nAnd btw, most service dogs are trained to eliminate on command. If you tell the friend you don't want the dog going in the yard, I'm sure they would just take the dog outside and take care of business elsewhere.

A medical device, it just happens to breathe. \n\nI promise you, at some point in their life, your children have been around poop and pee. Maybe a dog, maybe a cat, maybe a goose.

You gave him an alternative, and he rejected it, and it's not like he'll be the one cleaning the hair up.", "YTA for calling him your friend.  A dog coming over once in a while is hardly going to shed enough to be a bigger burden than the actual hosting you do.  Your objections are weak, and it makes you the AH.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI think it says a lot that you offered to pay for a monitoring device to help accommodate him in a way that you feel is reasonable. Good job there. \n\nWhile it is your home, and you should feel free to make and enforce the rules, your qualms about the consequences of having a dog over do not sound like big enough issues to justify excluding your friend, if he's that important to you. \n\nHair isn't that big of an issue, and your friend should be more than capable of picking up his dog's feces. They seem like minor inconveniences on your end. \n\nIt might not be simple for him to leave his service dog behind, and they may very well have a deep bond. Putting that on one side of the scale, and some hair / poop on the other, it just seems easier for you to accommodate if you value the relationship. \n\nI'm assuming there are no allergies, or any previous negative interactions to label the dog as dangerous or destructive.", "What? Fuck yeah YTA. You are excluding your friend because of his disability. Obviously there's a reason he chose the service dog over a monitoring device - SERVICE DOGS ARENT CHEAP!", "I could've understood if this was a case of someone in your family having allergies.

How much more self centered could you be?!", "YTA. Your friends service dog is a MEDICAL DEVICE and you banned him from using it.

It\u2019s your friend with a trained service dog for a genuine health issue.", "On one hand I can definitely see not wanting dog hair around the house, but a service dog won\u2019t be moving around your house a ton. Service animals also go potty on command so it\u2019s possible they wouldn\u2019t need to let the dog relive itself in your yard. I can\u2019t call you an asshole, but you\u2019re kinda a shitty friend.

I sympathize with him and personally, I\u2019d reconsider my friendship with you, if I were him. But you are absolutely within your rights to say no, it\u2019s your home and that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole to want to keep it a certain way. As a nurse, it\u2019s rare that I come across any diabetic patients that can\u2019t take care of themselves without a service dog. Sure they are helpful, but he has other options like checking his blood sugar more frequently. Unless there is more to the story, this isn\u2019t a life or death issue to be without the dog for a few hours, it seems more like his preference.", "Wow, this comment section is split.

That dog is trained to save his life.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine a service dog owner who wouldn\u2019t clean up after their dogs poo.  As for pee, birds and other animals are peeing on your lawn constantly. \n\nShedding would most likely be minimal, if at all, in the time your friend would be visiting. \n\nThe bottom line is you don\u2019t like dogs.

I certainly expect you to never say yes to letting your kids have a dog.", "NTA-someone else\u2019s needs still are never your responsibility. it\u2019s your house and i would feel the same way. i don\u2019t like dogs, the feel of their spit and hair makes me panic, so i don\u2019t have them. i wouldn\u2019t want someone else\u2019s in my house either. I think you were more than generous asking to pay for a monitoring system", "NAH.

I've seen plenty of service dogs. They're incredibly well trained. When in public, I have never seen one have an accident.", "YTA only because your friend isn't. He needs this dog for medical reasons. Service dogs are specially cared for as they are there for a specific purpose.

Prioritizing not having dog poop in the yard or fur in the house (both of which are easily fixable) over your friend's health is pretty shitty.", "NTA!  I might get slack for it, but it's your house your rules.  If you have a rule against having dogs in the house that's your right.  Your house is not some public establishment.  Your friend has every right to choose not to come to your house based on your rules.  Aid dogs even though they are well behaved, doesn't change the fact that they still shed.  If you are uncomfortable with it then that's your choice.", "I really don\u2019t have a judgement, you don\u2019t HAVE to allow anyone into your home, for whatever reasons you decide, and he doesn\u2019t have to abide by your rules or come to your house. So I guess NAH\n\nBut, I don\u2019t agree with all the \u201cYTA, it\u2019s a medical device!!\u201d stuff. CGMs are MORE reliable, and cheaper. There\u2019s no real reason for DADs anymore. They\u2019re not cost effective, it\u2019s downright idiotic to rely solely on a living being for something like this, (What if they\u2019re sick, or die?) and they\u2019re not more reliable.", "YTA, sorry but service dogs aren\u2019t like just a regular dog. They\u2019re trained, they behave seriously I\u2019d rather have someone with a service animal over than some of my friends and their disrespectful children. Talk to this friend, maybe explain your fears, I\u2019m sure they could help you understand and it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a problem.", "YTA\n\nAnd you're kind of awful.

As others have pointed out, it's a medical service dog.\n\nIf you want to be stringent, simply put rules in place.

Make it clear cut rules, so then if he does break them, you can keep his dog from coming with clear examples of why. Then, if yoy stop his dog from coming over, you won't be TA, because you will have proof in hand that he doesn't follow your rules, and that is the reason his dog isn't allowed.", "NTA.

Service dogs are highly trained to tasks! Yes you offered a monitoring device but have it ever occurred to you that your friend can\u2019t use the phone for diabetes because it can be inaccurate!\n\nA service dog for that purpose because dogs can detect blood sugar levels(when they get too high or low) before even a device can detect it!\n\nBy saying, \u201cYour dog is not welcome.\u201d You are saying, \u201cHow about I put your life in danger because I don\u2019t care about you or your health.\u201d", "YTA - this dog could save your friend\u2019s life, it\u2019s not some vanity pet that he\u2019s masquerading as a service animal.", "Here\u2019s the thing.

A lot of people use the dogs to avoid sticking themselves to check or to alert them even faster than the monitors, since dogs can smell so well. (If you pay attention to diabetic people you can smell their breath change when they have a spike/drop, but usually by the time people can smell it, it's about to be critical) The dogs are also trained to get help if necessary, retrieve insulin/meds if the person can't get up to get them, assist with fainting episodes, etc. \n\nThe people saying Y T A don't seem to recognize that you offered a solution, and that it is your own house.

The issue arises in that he wants to bring it to my house when I host hangouts/parties.  I'm not much of a dog person and really don't want it at my house.  It is a breed that sheds and I don't want to have to deal with dog hair in my house.  Also my kids regularly play in our yard and I don't want them to encounter dog poop and pee. \n\nI've spend the last 10 years in this house turning it into a place my friends, family and I could hang out.  I have a pool, I built a bar in my basement, those types of upgrades.  I offered to meet out at a restaurant or someone else's place and host less, but my house is the preferred destination among everyone else.  I have amenities that others don't and there are no expensive food and bar tabs at my place.  I host a lot during football season and other major sporting events, with some general hangouts in between.\n\nI told my friend that his dog wasn't welcome.  I offered to pay for a monitoring device he can use while at my house, but he didn't take that offer well.  He let me know he wasn't happy and recently missed our Super Bowl get together.  AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The dog is more reliable when properly trained than that device.\n\nThat dog is a safety measure for this person. Which could result in life or death, and that dog will be able to detect the change in his blood sugar faster than a device will, and will properly alert its owner.\n\nBut it is your home, and you have a right to make the rules. Just know you will lose that friend, and probably more because of this. As you should since you are being a AH. \n\nI wouldn't be friends with someone who denies a person a life saving aid like that.", "You offered to pay for a monitoring device??

We are talking about a service dog, not a pet. A medical device, if you will, and your friend\u2019s preferred device (as opposed to a monitor). If your friend were blind, would you ask him to leave his guide dog at home and you\u2019ll just provide him with a cane? Or if he needed a wheelchair would you request he leave that at home so you won\u2019t get wheel tracks in your carpet/lawn? \n\nIn theory, it\u2019s your house and you can make the rules but you are saying your house/lawn is more important than his comfort.

I feel like you could have approached this better with your friend and asked politely if he needs the dog with him at all times etc and had a discussion about all of your concerns before jumping to \u201cyour dog is not welcome\u201d as many folks become very attached to their service animals. This whole thing sucks because neither of you want to accommodate the other.\n\nObviously he hasn\u2019t always had this dog or this would have never been an issue as he would have just never been invited. It would help to know how severe his condition is.  I have a lot of diabetic friends and none of them have a service animal.  If this is super severe then maybe you are pretty insensitive.  If it\u2019s not then maybe you just went about it badly.", "YTA. So there's a little bit more cleanup because there's a dog. You'd rather make your friend sit out get togethers because of inconvenience to you? I hope he finds better friends.", "NAH - Its your house and you get to determine if its dog friendly or not.

To me, it seems like there should be many options for an individual to test their glucose levels and stay safe that would allow your friend to not require his service animal at your get togethers. At the same time I think you are not being very accommodating to your friends needs. It's your house and I generally would not call someone an AH for having rules in places, no matter how insensitive they might be. If your friend truly needs this service animal to keep their blood sugar levels at a safe level then it's unfortunate how this is playing out. In my opinion it just seems neither side is trying to make any concessions to make this work. In the end I think both sides are allowed to feel the way they feel for their own reason. But other than that I don't know how else to judge this. Will be interesting getting more perspective from other people.", "Im sure in your head you imagine this dog to just lose all its fur and find it in every nook and cranny of your house, but it's not like that.  You should come to an agreement that maybe the dog must stay off all furniture, and if it uses the bathroom, he has to pick it up immediately. Now, if you or someone in your family is allergic to dog hair then you have a solid reason. Otherwise, quit being an AH and be nice to your friend and his new, NEEDED, counterpart.", "NAH.   It's ok to not want to clean up dog hair.  But it's not ok for your friend to have to leave their service dog elsewhere if they want to socialise with you.

His alert dog. \n\nYeah, YTA.", "YTA some diabetics are Asymptomatic & there are no visible signs when their sugar drops.\nIt's life or death. I highly doubt the dog sheds a lot. Your friend would also pick up dog poop. He can use water to wash it away. Or you could ask him to walk the dog so it can use the bathroom.\n\nYou could end up in a similar medical condition one day. Imagine your friend treating you like this. Hurts right???", "YTA\n\nPersonally, if I were in your friend group and found out you were excluding M38 due to his diabetes, I would self-exclude. \n\nIf M38 or another friend were, or became, vision impaired, would you exclude them because of a Guide Dog, they pee and poo also?\n\nWe already know you would exclude a friend if they had lower limb immobility.", "Omg. Seriously?! How would you feel if someone did this to you or your kids? Yeah. Of course YTA.", "NAH.

Its not going to pee/poo willynilly and your friend should be able to handle that before arriving.", "NtA. \n\nYou offered a solution. He didn't want it. The ball was in his court. Apparently winning the argument was more important to him compared to having a good time with his friends.\n\nHowever, you will be branded a ahole here.

Too bad one of the amenities available in your home isn't compassion.", "NTA.  I have a dog.  It's hard for some of my friends to come here due to severe allergies or fear of dogs.  Some people just have dog issues.  My house is the largest, has the most amenities, and is definitely the most logical for parties except that some of my friends can't attend.  From my end, I can't get rid of my dog.  I am fine keeping her in a room while we have company, but the two friends I have with severe allergies are still nearly impossible to accommodate.  We meet up other places and just accept that particular hurdle in our relationship.  \n\nWith regards to OP, I think it's fine to tell people 'no dogs' EVEN if it's so hard to accept.  It would be lovely if everyone could come over, including the dog, and it's all fine, but it's also fine to really just not be ok with having a dog in your home... service dog or not.  The friends I have with severe allergies certainly wouldn't be able to hang out next to any dog regardless of the dog's function.", "NTA, it's your house. As someone who was in a relationship with a type 1 diabetic for 11 years, what is this dog supposed to do? Let the owner know when his blood sugar is low? Why can't he just check it himself?", "NTA if you offer to meet elsewhere, you literally don't need to offer any more in your own home than you want to, irrespective of the reasoning, if OP was allergic and the friend wanted to bring him over would you be okay with the decline then?", "YTA - It is your house and your rules, but you have shown that you value the house and your guidelines more than your friend. As for the people saying you offered an alternative monitoring method, for many people, their service animals are so much more than \"a device\" and become a part of that person. Natural when you depend on them to save your life.\n\nI am not fond of dogs either, but I would damn sure deal with if I really valued that friend. Once a friend of mine was coming to a party after being out of town for a month or two. She asked if she could bring her dog which she hadn't seen in this time.

But you have to accept that that means your friend (and maybe another friend or two, depending) may not want to come spend time at your house anymore because of it. It's like all those posts about childfree weddings where people turn down RSVPs because they can't find/afford babysitting for their kid(s). You're on the fence right now, but if you made like a bridezilla and complained about your friend not coming over anymore despite banning his medical aide, you'd firmly be TA.\n\nExtra notes: It's not a pet that's going to be running around getting hair everywhere, and presumably your friend would pick up after it if it uses the bathroom in your yard.

The only reason I\u2019d understand and say not TA is if someone in your house had an allergy to dogs or maybe even had a fear of dogs maybe from a past bite or bad experience or something, then that would be more understandable imo. But \u201cnot much of a dog person\u201d and concerned with the hair, and pee and poop in the yard? Come on. You\u2019ve probably lost a friend all because you sound a little obsessed with cleanliness, or just can\u2019t be bothered to be slightly inconvenienced - if you can even call vacuuming that - for a friend, and, inexplicably, there being dog pee somewhere in your yard. \n\nA true service dog is extremely well behaved. It may even be better behaved than a child tbh.

And poop can be picked up - you could just tell your friend to make sure they pick up after the dog when they go potty, being that this is a service dog, it won\u2019t be straying from its owner and a speedy pick up should not be a problem. It comes down to the fact that you value your cleanliness and comfort over your friend\u2019s needs. I would say that\u2019s a pretty crappy friend.

Their accuracy also plummets overnight because dogs are living creatures who need to sleep, too.    The \"certifications\" are provided only by the companies that sell the dogs.

Since I\u2019ve had children, she has a new motivation to stick around for her grandkids.

Even when the emergency alert goes off how is someone in the next room over going to know to follow that sound to find me on the floor?)\n\nJust because something is the \"standard of care\" doesnt mean it works for everyone.

My son has no depth perception due to being blind in one eye and has an intellectual disability. He also has severe anxiety. My father and stepmother redid their front yard (which has an incline) and put in these great looking giant rock steps. Think something you would see in a stream. They do look cool. No handrails, though. My son can\u2019t walk up them. We used to just walk across the lawn. No big deal. But the bushes and plants have grown so big that we can\u2019t get by without getting hit in the face unless we walk on the edge of the mini fish pond\u2026 literally on the edge. If we push through the plants we will damage them and that would not go well for me. So we can\u2019t get into the house from the front. The back is a bit better but still difficult because of the steps. \n\n\nI get that it\u2019s their yard and they need to landscape to what they want, but it would have been nice if they left a path for my son, even if it was hidden from view so it didn\u2019t ruin the aesthetics. We rarely go there anymore and they never come to us.", "Why do you have to ever go?", "Your family sucks, I can't believe, well I can because people are selfish and shitty, that they care more about the aesthetic and that shit than your health, God help me to stay away from people like them.\n\nAt least you have a good husband who cares about you.", "I\u2019m sorry for your shitty situation, but it brings a badly needed perspective the OP clearly lacked.

Our house is a dog free zone. It is the one place he can go that he doesn't have to deal with anything he doesn't want to. \n\nThat is how anyone's home should feel. Doesn't matter if they are allergic or just don't like animals they don't want them there. Can people have their one sanctuary where they can generally do what they want? \n\nFor me it is medical Marijuana. Lot's of people don't want me doing it even now that it's legal so I don't. I also don't go over there. It's their sanctuary so I don't mess with it. My mom says no sex before marriage so I never slept with a boyfriend at her house. \n\nIt's one think to expect public places to be accomodating but another thing entirely to start giving up their sanctuary where they can get away and have a place where they feel comfortable.

I have medical devices that an ungodly amount of money is spent for just so I can be alive and get a somewhat normal life. I often cant function, or even be able to legally drive, depending on my blood sugar.

Diabetes is a complex cardio vascular disease. There is type 1 and type 2. Type 1 is generally diagnosed early in life, there are a few different reasons but simply put it\u2019s where the body isn\u2019t producing enough insulin (people may point out other things here but this is just to keep it simple.) type 2 usually occurs in people with unhealthy lifestyles because they develop an insulin resistance. (Again a bit of a generalization). Both can be contributed to by genetics. Type 1 requires insulin therapy. Type 2 can be controlled through diet and exercise but sometimes also requires insulin therapy. \n\nAs for blood sugar monitoring, the most accurate way to do this is to poke your finger and put a drop of blood on a chemstrip in a glucometer. This will tell you how much sugar is in your blood. This will help you calculate how much insulin is needed. \n\nThere are also different types of insulin that have different indications. Some of them are long acting and are used daily, others are short acting and only used with meals. It\u2019s up to your doctor/diabetic program to assist with managing this disease. \n\nEven when a diabetic is in critical condition you are almost never checking your blood sugar more than once an hour. \n\nA person who has lived with diabetes for their life, or many years, likely has a stable routine and depending on the insulin dependence will only check it 1-4 times per day. There are always exceptions to this. But this is a general summary. Hope that helps.", "My brother is diabetic so I can tell you that what the person above said has a core of truth but is inaccurate. With the device that pins your finger you don\u2019t need to check it every 5 minute or anyone that can\u2019t afford any other way would be doomed to spend their lives checking their glucose levels. And same thing for the one that is constantly on your arm. Diabetic people get used to understand when they\u2019re low or high, and check it when needed to understand how bad it is and if it\u2019s high how much insuline to take. The comment above makes it seem like if you\u2019re diabetic and don\u2019t have a therapeutic dog you must spend your life checking your glucose levels, thing that is totally not true. For instance my brother uses the pin device and probably checks 6/7 times a day top, before meals and if feeling wrong.", "and less hairy", "I want some of what you're smoking.
