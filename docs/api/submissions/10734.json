The issue arises in that he wants to bring it to my house when I host hangouts/parties.  I'm not much of a dog person and really don't want it at my house.  It is a breed that sheds and I don't want to have to deal with dog hair in my house.  Also my kids regularly play in our yard and I don't want them to encounter dog poop and pee. \n\nI've spend the last 10 years in this house turning it into a place my friends, family and I could hang out.  I have a pool, I built a bar in my basement, those types of upgrades.  I offered to meet out at a restaurant or someone else's place and host less, but my house is the preferred destination among everyone else.  I have amenities that others don't and there are no expensive food and bar tabs at my place.  I host a lot during football season and other major sporting events, with some general hangouts in between.\n\nI told my friend that his dog wasn't welcome.  I offered to pay for a monitoring device he can use while at my house, but he didn't take that offer well.  He let me know he wasn't happy and recently missed our Super Bowl get together.

If you wouldn't deny a wheel chair user or someone with an oxygen tank into your home, you shouldn't deny the dog either. Ask that the friend makes sure the dog is well groomed/brushed before coming over to not worry about shedding as much. \n\nAnd btw, most service dogs are trained to eliminate on command. If you tell the friend you don't want the dog going in the yard, I'm sure they would just take the dog outside and take care of business elsewhere.

A medical device, it just happens to breathe. \n\nI promise you, at some point in their life, your children have been around poop and pee. Maybe a dog, maybe a cat, maybe a goose.

You gave him an alternative, and he rejected it, and it's not like he'll be the one cleaning the hair up.", "YTA for calling him your friend.  A dog coming over once in a while is hardly going to shed enough to be a bigger burden than the actual hosting you do.  Your objections are weak, and it makes you the AH.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI think it says a lot that you offered to pay for a monitoring device to help accommodate him in a way that you feel is reasonable. Good job there. \n\nWhile it is your home, and you should feel free to make and enforce the rules, your qualms about the consequences of having a dog over do not sound like big enough issues to justify excluding your friend, if he's that important to you. \n\nHair isn't that big of an issue, and your friend should be more than capable of picking up his dog's feces. They seem like minor inconveniences on your end. \n\nIt might not be simple for him to leave his service dog behind, and they may very well have a deep bond. Putting that on one side of the scale, and some hair / poop on the other, it just seems easier for you to accommodate if you value the relationship. \n\nI'm assuming there are no allergies, or any previous negative interactions to label the dog as dangerous or destructive.", "What? Fuck yeah YTA. You are excluding your friend because of his disability. Obviously there's a reason he chose the service dog over a monitoring device - SERVICE DOGS ARENT CHEAP!", "I could've understood if this was a case of someone in your family having allergies.

The dog is better than a machine and it is to save yours friends life.", "Yeahhhh, yta.

How much more self centered could you be?!", "YTA. Your friends service dog is a MEDICAL DEVICE and you banned him from using it.

It\u2019s your friend with a trained service dog for a genuine health issue.", "On one hand I can definitely see not wanting dog hair around the house, but a service dog won\u2019t be moving around your house a ton. Service animals also go potty on command so it\u2019s possible they wouldn\u2019t need to let the dog relive itself in your yard. I can\u2019t call you an asshole, but you\u2019re kinda a shitty friend.

I sympathize with him and personally, I\u2019d reconsider my friendship with you, if I were him. But you are absolutely within your rights to say no, it\u2019s your home and that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole to want to keep it a certain way. As a nurse, it\u2019s rare that I come across any diabetic patients that can\u2019t take care of themselves without a service dog. Sure they are helpful, but he has other options like checking his blood sugar more frequently. Unless there is more to the story, this isn\u2019t a life or death issue to be without the dog for a few hours, it seems more like his preference.", "Wow, this comment section is split.

That dog is trained to save his life.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine a service dog owner who wouldn\u2019t clean up after their dogs poo.  As for pee, birds and other animals are peeing on your lawn constantly. \n\nShedding would most likely be minimal, if at all, in the time your friend would be visiting. \n\nThe bottom line is you don\u2019t like dogs.

I certainly expect you to never say yes to letting your kids have a dog.", "NTA-someone else\u2019s needs still are never your responsibility. it\u2019s your house and i would feel the same way. i don\u2019t like dogs, the feel of their spit and hair makes me panic, so i don\u2019t have them. i wouldn\u2019t want someone else\u2019s in my house either. I think you were more than generous asking to pay for a monitoring system", "NAH.

I've seen plenty of service dogs. They're incredibly well trained. When in public, I have never seen one have an accident.", "YTA only because your friend isn't. He needs this dog for medical reasons. Service dogs are specially cared for as they are there for a specific purpose. Unless you've seen the dog be messy and/or the owner careless with him, he'll just sit at his owner's side and do nothing but watch over him.

Prioritizing not having dog poop in the yard or fur in the house (both of which are easily fixable) over your friend's health is pretty shitty.", "NTA!  I might get slack for it, but it's your house your rules.  If you have a rule against having dogs in the house that's your right.  Your house is not some public establishment.  Your friend has every right to choose not to come to your house based on your rules.  Aid dogs even though they are well behaved, doesn't change the fact that they still shed.  If you are uncomfortable with it then that's your choice.", "I really don\u2019t have a judgement, you don\u2019t HAVE to allow anyone into your home, for whatever reasons you decide, and he doesn\u2019t have to abide by your rules or come to your house. So I guess NAH\n\nBut, I don\u2019t agree with all the \u201cYTA, it\u2019s a medical device!!\u201d stuff. CGMs are MORE reliable, and cheaper. There\u2019s no real reason for DADs anymore. They\u2019re not cost effective, it\u2019s downright idiotic to rely solely on a living being for something like this, (What if they\u2019re sick, or die?) and they\u2019re not more reliable.", "YTA, sorry but service dogs aren\u2019t like just a regular dog. They\u2019re trained, they behave seriously I\u2019d rather have someone with a service animal over than some of my friends and their disrespectful children. Talk to this friend, maybe explain your fears, I\u2019m sure they could help you understand and it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a problem.", "YTA\n\nAnd you're kind of awful.

As others have pointed out, it's a medical service dog.\n\nIf you want to be stringent, simply put rules in place. Explain to your friend that if the kids end up falling and landing in sh*t in the yard or piss because he doesn't take care of his dog properly, he's out. Make it clear cut rules, so then if he does break them, you can keep his dog from coming with clear examples of why. Then, if yoy stop his dog from coming over, you won't be TA, because you will have proof in hand that he doesn't follow your rules, and that is the reason his dog isn't allowed.", "NTA.

Service dogs are highly trained to tasks! Yes you offered a monitoring device but have it ever occurred to you that your friend can\u2019t use the phone for diabetes because it can be inaccurate!\n\nA service dog for that purpose because dogs can detect blood sugar levels(when they get too high or low) before even a device can detect it!\n\nBy saying, \u201cYour dog is not welcome.\u201d You are saying, \u201cHow about I put your life in danger because I don\u2019t care about you or your health.\u201d", "YTA - this dog could save your friend\u2019s life, it\u2019s not some vanity pet that he\u2019s masquerading as a service animal.", "Here\u2019s the thing.

A lot of people use the dogs to avoid sticking themselves to check or to alert them even faster than the monitors, since dogs can smell so well. (If you pay attention to diabetic people you can smell their breath change when they have a spike/drop, but usually by the time people can smell it, it's about to be critical) The dogs are also trained to get help if necessary, retrieve insulin/meds if the person can't get up to get them, assist with fainting episodes, etc. \n\nThe people saying Y T A don't seem to recognize that you offered a solution, and that it is your own house.

The issue arises in that he wants to bring it to my house when I host hangouts/parties.  I'm not much of a dog person and really don't want it at my house.  It is a breed that sheds and I don't want to have to deal with dog hair in my house.  Also my kids regularly play in our yard and I don't want them to encounter dog poop and pee. \n\nI've spend the last 10 years in this house turning it into a place my friends, family and I could hang out.  I have a pool, I built a bar in my basement, those types of upgrades.  I offered to meet out at a restaurant or someone else's place and host less, but my house is the preferred destination among everyone else.  I have amenities that others don't and there are no expensive food and bar tabs at my place.  I host a lot during football season and other major sporting events, with some general hangouts in between.\n\nI told my friend that his dog wasn't welcome.  I offered to pay for a monitoring device he can use while at my house, but he didn't take that offer well.  He let me know he wasn't happy and recently missed our Super Bowl get together.  AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nAs someone who has a family member with a service dog I can tell you that they are very well behaved, and if they have to go to the bathroom the owner usually takes them to an acceptable place, or cleans up after them. \n\nYou offered a monitoring device to this person, what you don't understand is those malfunction, die, and are not always reliable. The dog is more reliable when properly trained than that device.\n\nThat dog is a safety measure for this person. Which could result in life or death, and that dog will be able to detect the change in his blood sugar faster than a device will, and will properly alert its owner.\n\nBut it is your home, and you have a right to make the rules. Just know you will lose that friend, and probably more because of this. As you should since you are being a AH. \n\nI wouldn't be friends with someone who denies a person a life saving aid like that.", "You offered to pay for a monitoring device?? How stupid of people to invest a lot of money in training dogs for that reason specifically...\n\nWould you tell a disabled person to not bring his wheelchair to your house? Yes, you would be that person. \n\nYTA", "NTA. I feel for your friend, but being diabetic doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to bend around your needs, and especially not when it causes problems for the other people involved (dog fur, dog poo, etc\u2026).

Hopefully your friend will learn to compromise.", "NTA, you understand why he has a dog and even tried to accomodate him the best you can.

We are talking about a service dog, not a pet. A medical device, if you will, and your friend\u2019s preferred device (as opposed to a monitor). If your friend were blind, would you ask him to leave his guide dog at home and you\u2019ll just provide him with a cane? Or if he needed a wheelchair would you request he leave that at home so you won\u2019t get wheel tracks in your carpet/lawn? \n\nIn theory, it\u2019s your house and you can make the rules but you are saying your house/lawn is more important than his comfort. Don\u2019t be surprised if he decides his comfort and health is more important than your friendship. \n\nIt should be noted that service dogs are very well behaved, don\u2019t poop everywhere, and a few hours will not cover your house in dog hair.", "YTA.\n\nHe\u2019s a diabetic and it\u2019s a service dog. It alerts him to a medical issue. The ADA requires public spaces and businesses to allow service dogs because\u2026 THEY SERVE A PURPOSE.

ESH. I totally understand you not wanting a dog in your home.  It makes it hard to explain to your children why they can\u2019t have dogs if your friend can bring a dog.  I feel like you could have approached this better with your friend and asked politely if he needs the dog with him at all times etc and had a discussion about all of your concerns before jumping to \u201cyour dog is not welcome\u201d as many folks become very attached to their service animals. This whole thing sucks because neither of you want to accommodate the other.\n\nObviously he hasn\u2019t always had this dog or this would have never been an issue as he would have just never been invited. It would help to know how severe his condition is.  I have a lot of diabetic friends and none of them have a service animal.  If this is super severe then maybe you are pretty insensitive.  If it\u2019s not then maybe you just went about it badly.", "YTA. So there's a little bit more cleanup because there's a dog. You'd rather make your friend sit out get togethers because of inconvenience to you? I hope he finds better friends.", "NAH - Its your house and you get to determine if its dog friendly or not. Its also totally reasonable that people will be pissed at you for prioritizing your own preferences and comfort over theirs / the groups. \n\nPeople can be justifiably angry at a decision without it making you an asshole.", "YTA. Are you going to provide him alerts regarding his diabetes when you won't let him bring his medically necessary dog with him? His dog is a medical device, not a pet.", "NAH", "YTA; they have that service dog for a reason, to alert them if their blood sugar is getting high, so you could be seriously endangering their health that way\n\nIf you don\u2019t want the dog there, don\u2019t invite your friend over, simple as that", "YTA -   \n1) It's a trained service dog  \n2) there are easy solutions to the pee and poop points you made  \n3) dog would likely be only in one place, this is not subjecting your house to hair everywhere  \n4) Your friend needs it for medical reasons and likely doesn't want a device for personal reasons  \n5) Be a good friend", "NAH\n\nI'm no expert on diabetes or diabetic alert service animals. To me, it seems like there should be many options for an individual to test their glucose levels and stay safe that would allow your friend to not require his service animal at your get togethers. At the same time I think you are not being very accommodating to your friends needs. It's your house and I generally would not call someone an AH for having rules in places, no matter how insensitive they might be. If your friend truly needs this service animal to keep their blood sugar levels at a safe level then it's unfortunate how this is playing out. In my opinion it just seems neither side is trying to make any concessions to make this work. In the end I think both sides are allowed to feel the way they feel for their own reason. But other than that I don't know how else to judge this. Will be interesting getting more perspective from other people.", "Im sure in your head you imagine this dog to just lose all its fur and find it in every nook and cranny of your house, but it's not like that.  You should come to an agreement that maybe the dog must stay off all furniture, and if it uses the bathroom, he has to pick it up immediately. Now, if you or someone in your family is allergic to dog hair then you have a solid reason. Otherwise, quit being an AH and be nice to your friend and his new, NEEDED, counterpart.", "NAH.   It's ok to not want to clean up dog hair.  But it's not ok for your friend to have to leave their service dog elsewhere if they want to socialise with you.  You have to meet them elsewhere and make it so your house is no longer where everyone hangs out.  I would change my vote if you were going to insist your friend only see you at yours.", "YTA\n\nIf it were a pet dog, you'd be in the clear. But this is a diabetic alert dog -- an actual, trained service animal! Your friend got it to assist with their health! \n\nThat's a huge dick move. And it sends some very bad signals. If i were that friend, I'd probably be reevaluating my relationship with you.", "So let me get this straight, you care more about your house than your friend's life? Sure, you offered to buy a monitoring device as a compromise, but did you know that they aren't always accurate or effective?

His alert dog. \n\nYeah, YTA.", "YTA some diabetics are Asymptomatic & there are no visible signs when their sugar drops.\nIt's life or death. I highly doubt the dog sheds a lot. Your friend would also pick up dog poop. He can use water to wash it away. Or you could ask him to walk the dog so it can use the bathroom.\n\nYou could end up in a similar medical condition one day. Imagine your friend treating you like this. Hurts right???", "YTA\n\nPersonally, if I were in your friend group and found out you were excluding M38 due to his diabetes, I would self-exclude. \n\nIf M38 or another friend were, or became, vision impaired, would you exclude them because of a Guide Dog, they pee and poo also?\n\nWe already know you would exclude a friend if they had lower limb immobility.", "Omg. Seriously?! How would you feel if someone did this to you or your kids? Yeah. Of course YTA.", "NAH. Giving you grace that you don't know dogs, understand a service dog is a dog trained for a specific function. Its not going to pee/poo willynilly and your friend should be able to handle that before arriving.", "NtA. \n\nYou offered a solution. He didn't want it. The ball was in his court. Apparently winning the argument was more important to him compared to having a good time with his friends.\n\nHowever, you will be branded a ahole here. It's blasphemy to admit that you don't like dogs. And a service dog? All reason goes out the window. \n\nBTW. What is a diabetic alert service dog? \ud83d\ude33 does it smell the sugar?", "OK, here is the thing, you do not want a dog in your house, I get that so, NTA.   \nYou are, however, an incredibly shitty friend and should make sure to let everyone know why this particular person is will no longer be welcomed in your house. You should also be prepared for a severe decline in invitations accepted to future events.  \nYou cannot simply get a \"monitoring device\" if a person's diabetes is at the level, they need a service dog. Too bad one of the amenities available in your home isn't compassion.", "NTA.  I have a dog.  It's hard for some of my friends to come here due to severe allergies or fear of dogs.  Some people just have dog issues.  My house is the largest, has the most amenities, and is definitely the most logical for parties except that some of my friends can't attend.  From my end, I can't get rid of my dog.  I am fine keeping her in a room while we have company, but the two friends I have with severe allergies are still nearly impossible to accommodate.  We meet up other places and just accept that particular hurdle in our relationship.  \n\nWith regards to OP, I think it's fine to tell people 'no dogs' EVEN if it's so hard to accept.  It would be lovely if everyone could come over, including the dog, and it's all fine, but it's also fine to really just not be ok with having a dog in your home... service dog or not.  The friends I have with severe allergies certainly wouldn't be able to hang out next to any dog regardless of the dog's function.", "NTA, it's your house. As someone who was in a relationship with a type 1 diabetic for 11 years, what is this dog supposed to do? Let the owner know when his blood sugar is low? Why can't he just check it himself?", "NTA if you offer to meet elsewhere, you literally don't need to offer any more in your own home than you want to, irrespective of the reasoning, if OP was allergic and the friend wanted to bring him over would you be okay with the decline then?", "YTA - It is your house and your rules, but you have shown that you value the house and your guidelines more than your friend. As for the people saying you offered an alternative monitoring method, for many people, their service animals are so much more than \"a device\" and become a part of that person. Natural when you depend on them to save your life.\n\nI am not fond of dogs either, but I would damn sure deal with if I really valued that friend. Once a friend of mine was coming to a party after being out of town for a month or two. She asked if she could bring her dog which she hadn't seen in this time. I sighed but agreed because I wanted her and her boyfriend there. Wasn't even a medical dog just some dog.", "I am disabled and have a service dog.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA\n_____\nYour house is your private property, service dogs of visitors have no rights there and are only welcomed with your direct permission. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter your reasons why, you 100% have the right to say no just because and your friend should respect that. \n\nThere are laws protecting service dogs with access rights, but they do not apply to certain situations, and this is one of them. \n____\nI would have chosen N-A-H but your friend declined your very generous alternative & still became upset about it. As a handler, he is completely aware he can not bring his SD into a private house without permission.", "Yta of the biggest proportions. You\u2019re also a shitty friend. The dog isn\u2019t an accessory. It\u2019s literally a life or death situation that the doggo is trained for.

(Poop can be picked up) you should probably take a deep breath before you read this - kids get dirty. Shocking. I know. Just tell your kids to be careful out in the grass. Or are you the type of helicopter parent who makes their kids play on a giant bubble? TLDR- kids get dirty. Get over yourself. \n\n\nAnimals shedding can be easily be managed. Ask your friend to make an effort to brush him the day before it morning of. \n\nIt makes me sad that you\u2019re so closed minded about dogs. You\u2019re truly missing out.

It's not a pet. The dog is expertly trained to detect a medical condition. A little dog hair is fairly easily removed. And if your friend is a responsible service animal owner, your children will not encounter any dog poop in your yard.", "In my opinion, YTA\n\nIt's your house and it's a perfectly reasonable request if you really never want a dog around. But you have to accept that that means your friend (and maybe another friend or two, depending) may not want to come spend time at your house anymore because of it. It's like all those posts about childfree weddings where people turn down RSVPs because they can't find/afford babysitting for their kid(s). You're on the fence right now, but if you made like a bridezilla and complained about your friend not coming over anymore despite banning his medical aide, you'd firmly be TA.\n\nExtra notes: It's not a pet that's going to be running around getting hair everywhere, and presumably your friend would pick up after it if it uses the bathroom in your yard. Actual licensed service dogs are well behaved, not like regular pets. When all it would take to clean up is vacuuming a little dog hair, I think you should at least give it a try and let your friend bring his dog a time or two at least, to see how it goes.", "YTA.

Businesses are not allowed to prevent him from bringing a service animal. Hotels can\u2019t charge him extra for a service animal nor prevent him from staying. \n\nThis dog serves a very important purpose and you keeping this animal away from him is like not letting him bring his insulin.
