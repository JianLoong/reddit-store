She knows what she said and she knows that it\u2019s an insult.", "You're not the asshole, but your friend is a pretty shitty dad, apparently.", "NTA. Doesn't matter if apparently the kid didn't know any better. She's 14 and she's going to learn she can't say that to people without consequences. Mays as well teach her now.", "She does not deserve any privileges after that. NTA", "NTA. A 14-year-old should have enough self-awareness to not insult an adults weight to their face (especially after you asked her not to say it again). Your friend and daughter should learn to respect people and admit when they\u2019re in the wrong. You aren\u2019t obligated to provide free streaming to the daughter. Your friend is TA for saying she doesn\u2019t know better and you\u2019re overreacting.", "NTA... 14 year olds need to do better. Social media has them all screwed up on body health and mental wellness. If she says it to you, she says it to or about other girls her age. Shows like euphoria have my 15 year old god daughter a hot mess. It's ridiculous and needs to stop.", "NTA. How rude! And you even offered to give her the new password if she apologises and she won\u2019t and you\u2019re wondering if you\u2019re TA?? No way.", "NTA, she\u2019s beyond old enough to know how rude that was. Actions have consequences and losing TV privileges is a perfectly reasonable step to take.", "NTA.  Being rude comes with consequences.", "NTA. She wouldn't apologize to her own godmother for being rude and hurtful? Yikes. Someone is failing that girl.", "Well it\u2019s called parenting and as a godparent you also have the right to steer the parenting decisions.", "NTA!! No boundaries\u2026 you did absolutely right and if they allow her to disrespect them like that\u2026 So beit!!", "NTA. You can't insult and abuse other people and expect gifts and favors in return. 14 is not too young to know what is hurtful to other people. If this young lady did not know better, now she's learning.", "NTA. Let us know when the parents give in and get her a Disney account.", "NTA, she can apologize or her parents can pay for it. She needs to learn that you don't bite the hand that feeds you.", "NTA - 14 year old girls know full well you don\u2019t call someone fat unless you are intending to be very mean and hurtful - it\u2019s bullying and they know it. If people are mean to someone then that person may well decide not to share their nice stuff with the bully. That\u2019s life and a valuable life lesson.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your friend wants the access back because the daughter is nagging her.  No way until she apologizes.  One of many life lessons she needs to learn.", "Nta she's 14 of course she knows better. She's a high schooler so yes she should know what she is saying is not ok. No you did not overreact. Your best friends daughter is very rude.", "NTA for a second I thought you could've handled that better but then I read she basically repeated herself. To top it off her mom said she's just a kid who doesn't know any better. So I guess if mom won't teach her, this is who she learns to know better.", "Why didn\u2019t your friend\u2026 teach her better?\n\nNTA", ">My best friend is now saying that I overreacted, and that she is only a kid who doesn\u2019t know better\n\nHow is supposed to \u201cknow better\u201d if she never learns from her mistakes?  Actions have consequences.  I used to be incredibly\u2026 \u201csarcastic\u201d when I was younger, until someone said something mean back to me.  When I said that hurt my feelings, they said \u201coh, so you can dish it out but you can\u2019t take it?\u201d I never realized my sarcasm just came off as mean-spirited.  (I can still be sarcastic sometimes, but I\u2019m working on it.)\n\nYou told her that what she said wasn\u2019t appropriate, and you let her know what she could do to make amends.  The ball\u2019s entirely in her court.  If she refuses to apologize even after knowing that she hurt your feelings, that\u2019s not a good sign.  Her parents need to address that.", "If I said that to my dads friend my dad would have grounded me for a month. To be fair if I said that about my dads friend to my dad alone he would have laughed but told me not to make personal remarks.
