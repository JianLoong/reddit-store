Doesn't matter if apparently the kid didn't know any better. She's 14 and she's going to learn she can't say that to people without consequences. Mays as well teach her now.", "She does not deserve any privileges after that. NTA", "NTA. A 14-year-old should have enough self-awareness to not insult an adults weight to their face (especially after you asked her not to say it again). Your friend and daughter should learn to respect people and admit when they\u2019re in the wrong. You aren\u2019t obligated to provide free streaming to the daughter. Your friend is TA for saying she doesn\u2019t know better and you\u2019re overreacting.", "NTA... 14 year olds need to do better. Social media has them all screwed up on body health and mental wellness. If she says it to you, she says it to or about other girls her age. Shows like euphoria have my 15 year old god daughter a hot mess. It's ridiculous and needs to stop.", "NTA. How rude! And you even offered to give her the new password if she apologises and she won\u2019t and you\u2019re wondering if you\u2019re TA?? No way.", "NTA, she\u2019s beyond old enough to know how rude that was. Actions have consequences and losing TV privileges is a perfectly reasonable step to take.", "NTA.  Being rude comes with consequences.", "NTA. She wouldn't apologize to her own godmother for being rude and hurtful? Yikes. Someone is failing that girl.", "Well it\u2019s called parenting and as a godparent you also have the right to steer the parenting decisions.", "NTA!! No boundaries\u2026 you did absolutely right and if they allow her to disrespect them like that\u2026 So beit!!", "NTA. You can't insult and abuse other people and expect gifts and favors in return. 14 is not too young to know what is hurtful to other people. If this young lady did not know better, now she's learning.", "NTA. Let us know when the parents give in and get her a Disney account.", "NTA, she can apologize or her parents can pay for it. She needs to learn that you don't bite the hand that feeds you.", "NTA - 14 year old girls know full well you don\u2019t call someone fat unless you are intending to be very mean and hurtful - it\u2019s bullying and they know it. If people are mean to someone then that person may well decide not to share their nice stuff with the bully. That\u2019s life and a valuable life lesson.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your friend wants the access back because the daughter is nagging her.  No way until she apologizes.  One of many life lessons she needs to learn.", "Nta she's 14 of course she knows better. She's a high schooler so yes she should know what she is saying is not ok. No you did not overreact. Your best friends daughter is very rude.", "NTA for a second I thought you could've handled that better but then I read she basically repeated herself. To top it off her mom said she's just a kid who doesn't know any better. So I guess if mom won't teach her, this is who she learns to know better.", "Why didn\u2019t your friend\u2026 teach her better?\n\nNTA", ">My best friend is now saying that I overreacted, and that she is only a kid who doesn\u2019t know better\n\nHow is supposed to \u201cknow better\u201d if she never learns from her mistakes?  Actions have consequences.  I used to be incredibly\u2026 \u201csarcastic\u201d when I was younger, until someone said something mean back to me.  When I said that hurt my feelings, they said \u201coh, so you can dish it out but you can\u2019t take it?\u201d I never realized my sarcasm just came off as mean-spirited.  (I can still be sarcastic sometimes, but I\u2019m working on it.)\n\nYou told her that what she said wasn\u2019t appropriate, and you let her know what she could do to make amends.  The ball\u2019s entirely in her court.  If she refuses to apologize even after knowing that she hurt your feelings, that\u2019s not a good sign.  Her parents need to address that.", "If I said that to my dads friend my dad would have grounded me for a month. To be fair if I said that about my dads friend to my dad alone he would have laughed but told me not to make personal remarks. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. she needs to face the consequences or apologize. she\u2019s not a toddler", "Even if she didn't know better (she did) she was told by OP that what she said was hurtful and doubled down. Play stupid games yadda yadda something.", "If she doesn\u2019t know better: hello parenting moment! Prime opportunity to teach her!\nIn the long run, OP is much kinder by providing a mild consequence than friend is by letting their daughter be a bully.", "Exactly!", "She's 14, and it's well past time she learnt about consequences. NTA.", "Shes 14, she definitely knows better, and if her Mother really didnt teach her any better, then she should be grateful that you are willing to give the lesson.\n\nWords and actions have consequences.", "NTA, my 5yo knows better. 14yo sure as shit should.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t even think about giving her access again. Yeah yeah she\u2019s 14 but that\u2019s even worse  in my opinion bc she\u2019s grown enough to have feelings, so how would she feel being called that? Your \u201cbest friend \u201c should get her own account if she doesn\u2019t see the reason why you deserve an apology and some damn respect ! This may be a stretch by in my opinion your friend is shitting for not responding properly and checking their child for disrespecting you.", ">she said \u201cYou\u2019re turning into a fatty.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s turning into an asshole.\n\nNTA\n\nno apology no password", "NTA- and honestly, even if she apologizes I wouldn\u2019t give her the password. What a little asshole. Some things are unforgivable and saying crap like that is one of them", "NTA if at 14 she doesn't understand the consequence of \"If you say cruel things people will dislike you\" and she doesn't suffer from a SEVERE neurological disability then she urgently needs teaching and it sounds like that's what you're doing. You gave her a chance to correct the behaviour before punishment, and you clearly explained to her the consequence and the reparation she can take to get back her access.", "At first I misread that she was 4, and I thought maybe you could give her another chance.  14?  Yikes.", "Why has the word fat been so demonized?", "NTA,14 knows what bullying is, 14 knows she how to show respect to an adult.  If she says that to you, what is she saying to kids in school?  She needs more than just losing the passwords.", "NTA, 14 is old enough to know you don\u2019t say things like that", "Ok we really are a fat phobic nation.", "If at 14 the girl does not know what she said was rude, offensive and down right disrespectful then your friend has failed as a parent. She's 14 not 4 and should know right from wrong at her age.  Stick to your guns and don't give her the password till the little gobshite apologises. The young lady needs to learn some damn manners if she wants people to do her favours.  I would've been mortified if my kids had spoken to my friend like that when they were that age and they would've been punished accordingly.", "I knew better at age 7, let alone age 14. That's BS and a failure of parenting. Keep the password.", "Yes Dad should have told her to apologize immediately.\nIf she really does not know better (is she neurodivergent?) then that was the opportunity to teach her.\nYou might want to consider what kind of friend he really is.", "This!", "I was thinking this. \n\nIt would have been more powerful to say 'so what?' rather than reinforce that being fat is a horrific fate. It also would have taken the wind out of the little brats sails.\n\nThe girl still needs to lose access because she was trying to hurt Op's feelings. \n\nSo NTA but could have handled it differently.", "Fr", "The phrase is play stupid games, win stupid prizes if that\u2019s what you wanted to say. And I agree OP is not the asshole, what the daughter said was not okay and didn\u2019t give a damn when OP said that was hurtful", "Really? That's the phrase? Are you sure?", "Yes, I\u2019ve heard it before. It means you say something stupid or rude you face the consequences of your actions", "You\u2019re definitely not in the wrong, what the girl said was completely rude, and her not apologizing for it also not okay. She should know better if she\u2019s 14 years old. I learned not to call people fat when I was younger", "I'm sorry, I guess I should have added /s.\n\nAs my father once said when a co-worker corrected him when he quipped that he felt like Diagnosis looking for an honest man, \"you disappoint me, Alf.\""]}
