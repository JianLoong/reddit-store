My nephew is on the spectrum, and he wouldn't dream of behaving that way. Sick of folks automatically conflating autism, depression, etc with bad etiquette & inept social behaviors, it's highly ignorant to paint with such a broad brush & all it does is stigmatize the conditions unfairly & needlessly.", "Because adding that stipulation or asking that clarification is an excuse in and of itself. If it doesn't matter (it doesn't) then it doesn't matter if it exists so why ask it?", "Thank you, that was it exactly.\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf3b", "Because I am shocked that a teenager doesn\u2019t know better and a parent is ok with it.\nIt doesn\u2019t change my judgement but as I work supporting youth wonder what kind of parent this youth has and if he\u2019s doing his job", "Prudent Plan said yada yada yada because everyone knows the rest of the line and didn\u2019t think it needed to be said. \ud83d\ude09", "She thinks she is being funny!\n\nNTA", "Now she knows better! Should thank you for the valuable life experiences! NTA", "Definitely NTA. I would have done the same exact thing. She's not a toddler who says that just because they're learning and even think it's beautiful. She's a teenager who knows that it's insulting to say it. And if all you asked her to do to get it back was apologize and she won't do that? Ridiculous. Her dad saying \"she's just a kid who doesn't know any better\" is total BS.  She's more than old enough to know better.", "NTA but if she doesn\u2019t know better at 14 he may want to take a look at his parenting skills!", "So if she doesn't know better, it's time for her dad to educate her.\n\nOP is prepared to forgive if she apologizes.  She refuses.  That's not about 'not knowing better'.", "\"She's only a kid who doesn't know better.\"  \n\n\nNo, she's a teenager your friend has decided NOT to teach to know better.  \n\n\nNTA. Don't give it back, even if she apologizes.", "NTA. How will she know better until you teach her the consequences?", "NTA, she is too old for that kinda shit", "NTA your friend has managed to bring up a very rude teen.", "TA if you\u2019re fat you\u2019re fat hit the gym and take her advice", "Call me fatty, you lose the ratty.", "He's right, she didn't know any better. You are providing a valuable lesson in that subject. Not so hard to apologize.\n\nNTA", "Yeah , I call bullshit a 14 year old doesn't know what she's saying, and how rude it is.  NTA", "She does know better she's 14 not 4, totally NTA but your bestie is the AH for raising a bully of a child.", "Nta she\u2019s fourteen she\u2019s not a child", "Kids that age sometimes don\u2019t really understand how disrespectful they are being. As a high school teacher, I often would straight up ask my students \u201cdid you mean to say that rudely?\u201d Or \u201cdo you realize that comment was hurtful?\u201d And a lot of times they actually look shocked and immediately apologize. I\u2019d take this as a teachable moment. She should know better but for some reason she doesn\u2019t. But nta for taking away the Disney+ but I hope you leave the door open for her to grow / apologies / whatever", "NTA. She wouldn't apologize to her own godmother for being rude and hurtful? Yikes. Someone is failing that girl.", "Well it\u2019s called parenting and as a godparent you also have the right to steer the parenting decisions.", "Hey if she didn\u2019t know better than this is a good way to teach her.   Tell your friend that it is weird she is comfortable with her daughter turning into a bully.", "NTA. Her mom can pay for her streaming. Rude AH's don't get access.   \n\nAlso, have an award for not putting up w anyone's shit!", "NTA. She\u2019s 14. She knows better. She needs to learn consequences and how to make amends. You\u2019re not asking a lot of her. It makes you wonder if she bullies other kids at school.", "Info\n\nI am currently on my third 14 year old. Is this trolling to be affectionate or is she insulting to be insulting?\n\nIe my 14 year old told her godfather he had a hockey mullet. He laughed because he did. She comes behind me while I\u2019m sitting and tells me she can see white hair taking over my part. I laugh because it\u2019s true. \n\nI\u2019m nearly 30 years older. Of course we\u2019re older, fatter, slower than a teen counterpart. Who cares?  I\u2019m a content dumpy graying lady. Who gives a fuck about what a 14 year old says when its their God-given duty to needle people?", "NTA\n\nMaybe if she was 4 I could see your friends point but this is a teenager, she knows better.", "NTA. As someone who grew up overweight I could always immediately tell what kids were well brought up by how they treated me before knowing me. I never had anyone make a comment like this after like age 10 but it was quite common from like 6-8. This doesn\u2019t sound like a 14 year old at all tbh.", "NTA Doesn\u2019t know better? She\u2019s already gone through the hell that is middle school- she understands what an insult is and how much it can hurt.", "She's 14. Good for you for making sure she understands there's consequences in the world. Stick to your word. NTA", "she's 14. she acts that way because her mother treats her like she knows no better. nta", "Agreed, but also, my 4 year old niece knows better than this 14 year old. So I think we should lower the comparison age.", "Exactly this. If he wants her to have it let him pay for it. You were doing it to be nice. She needs to learn manners. 14 is a teen. She know better just doesn't care.", "shit same here, i even correct my kid when she calls older people grandma and grandpa at the store lol", "Whoosh dude.  Whoosh.   Pretty embarrassing for you.
