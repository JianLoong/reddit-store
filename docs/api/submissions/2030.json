Her new husband is 40M. We have been divorced for a decade.\n\nWe have two kids together, 14M Connor and 11F Alissa, we share custody. Connor has cerebral palsy and is on a wheelchair, he has some developmental issues as well.\n\nMy ex and her husband have a 5yro son Matthew.\n\nYesterday was Alissa's birthday and she had a party at my ex's house. The grown ups were at the table and the kids were playing in the backyard. Matthew and another kid got into a fight, no big deal. Connor and another older boy (about 13yro I guess) told the younger kids to break it off. Matthew got angry at Connor and told him to shut up. Connor came to the table and told us what was going on, so my ex went there to calm the kids down.\n\nWhen she came back, we heard screaming and all ran to the kids. Turns out Matthew was angry at Connor for telling on him and threw a rock at his wheelchair (there is a dent on the control of his chair, so obviously something was thrown at it).\n\nI calmed Connor and my ex told Matthew to go into the house for a time out. Her husband said \"oh just let the kid enjoy the party\". I suggested maybe we just give the younger kids a few balls to play soccer or something and invite the older kids to our table for a while - to give everyone a chance to calm down a bit. My ex said Matthew has been acting out lately and has to take a time out now and apologize later.\n\nHer husband then said \"let's just forget about this, the kids were just roughhousing\". I then said \"well they weren't, no, Matthew threw a rock at Connor and he can't defend himself\" (I meant that Connor can't just protect his face with his arms or duck to avoid the rock). Ex's husband then said \"well he has to learn how to play with boys\" (Connor mostly just hangs out with Alissa).\n\nI then lost it and said \"you are such a jerk. Really, back off from my son\".\n\nMy ex is fuming with me, and says I have to apologize to her husband.\n\nAita here?\n\nTDLR: I called my ex's new husband a jerk after he defended his 5yro who threw a rock at my 14yro's wheelchair", "created_utc": 1668162901, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ys6v0r/aita_for_calling_my_exs_husband_a_jerk_at_my/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My father was in a wheelchair most of his life (a palsy of some type.) he endured constant belittling and verbal abuse by people.  I can\u2019t remember or count the number of times I had to defend him.  \n\nYou protecting your son is a beautiful thing.  Keep going, dad.  You\u2019re doing it right.  Also, F that guys feelings.", "The new husband is an idiot for not wanting to punish his son.\n\nHe is enabling a toxic behavior.\n\nI would say NTA because I would probably have said the same as you (me F)", "NTA  \n\n\nYou're protecting your kid.   \n\n\n\"He has to learn to play with the boys\" ...yeah. Boys who don't throw rocks at kids in wheelchairs, sure. His kid needs to learn to not throw rocks at kids in wheelchairs more than anything. I dont have kids but I can't imagine just shrugging off this sort of thing as \"boys will be boys\" and it would take a lot of personal strength to not drag that little shit to his dad and start shouting at him to try being a parent.", "NTA - the boy needs to know there are boundaries. Throwing a rock is not a little thing. Especially for a 5 year old who is just learning what is ok and what isn\u2019t. Your ex\u2018s husband working against you and your ex is not good parenting. How else should the boy learn that violence is not a good answer to conflict?", "NTA. I seriously question if Connor is safe at his mother's place, if her husband is that blind and/or cruel. Do keep a close eye and talk to Connor alone later on, because the husband's attitude is dangerous and this could be a sign of an ongoing risk to Connor's health and safety.", "Nta. While I understand that this is their child and you shouldn't interfere with others parenting, that's until your child is put in danger. They're essentially condoning horrendous behavior that if not corrected immediately will more than likely continue and escalate. \n\nHonestly you're protecting your child and have every fucking right to do so. You were much more calm than I would be. Honestly I would've snapped and said if this ever happens again you will speak to a lawyer about going for full custody as your son absolutely cannot protect himself and obviously a rock can 3nd up doing harm and They're doing absolutely nothing to stop and prevent that behavior. Put your son first because I 100% guarantee if they continue to do absolutely nothing things WILL CONTINUE AND WORSEN. A rock is serious business, small or not. If it was enough to dent a wheelchair it's enough to cause a pretty nice injury. It might sound harsh to go after full custody (obviously difficult to get, especially after such few instances but maybe that'd be enough of a wake-up call to even say that. And I personally don't think parents should ever do this unless absolutely necessary but it will become necessary relatively quickly in the scheme of things and it's better to prevent than 'clean-up' a bad situation afterwards.)\n\nAbsolutely do not apologize for not condoning their child to be an abusive asshole (I'd personally use those exact words) F keeping the peace on this one it was a frigging rock that actually caused damage! What if that was his face!?", "ESH (mostly NTA tho)\nbecause of poor choice of words, couldve said that in a better way... but the reaction is perfectly reasonable and its very good that you defend your son, that is very important, good work!", "ESH because of the way you reacted, but you were right to say something.\n\nThis isn't just about advocating for your son. I would hope you or any adult present would have spoken up protectively of a child with a vulnerability. I think the fact that it was ex's husband's son vs your son unfortunately makes the argument sound like you Vs him. This is probably exacerbated by the way you reacted.\n\nUltimately the behaviour was dangerous and needed to be nipped in the bud regardless, so you weren't in the wrong per se. It is in everyone's interests if all three kids can get along safely.\n\nEx's husband needs to stop seeing Connor's friendship with Alissa as problematic though. Connor will gravitate towards friends who are safe and respectful to be around. Matthew was not, on this occasion. Their friendship can be nurtured once Matthew can behave safely. Not before.", "ESH. Obviously throwing rocks is not to be tolerated. But the way you responded I think was more than the situation warranted.  His comment may not have been the right approach but you went straight to personal insult which leads he to believe your reaction was about more than than just his response to the childrens fight.", "ESH.\n\nYou were trying to parent a kid who is not yours. Your ex and her husband were dealing with THEIR child's bad behaviour and you should have stayed out of this, especially as you were a guest in their house.\n\nAnd your ex and her husband might consider individual and family therapy because I get the feeling that the 5 year old is picking on his brother because he resents him for being the center of the world.", "Mmm. Tricky one. I get where you were coming from but I think you escalated it by jumping to slinging personal insults at your ex's husband, instead of responding calmly. Calm would (probably) have been more effective, whereas calling him a jerk ironically made you a jerk. \n\nBut then your son did just get a rock thrown at him. 5 year old's should know better than to throw stones when angry (especially at people who can't defend themselves) and if they don't, they need to learn pronto. So the husband (and your ex wife) really should have taken that seriously instead of dismissing it as \"rough housing\". \n\nI'm going to go with ESH. Husband for his underreaction, you for your slight over-reaction, and your wife for essentially taking her husband's side in the disagreement between you two. \n\nHaving said all that, I think there's real potential for you to be a massive asshole about this, and drive a huge wedge between your children's families by turning this into a major row instead of a relatively minor altercation that could be treated as a teaching moment, and resolved by your ex wife having a stern conversation with her 5 year old. And also with her husband. \n\nBut the person who was really wronged was your son, and he ought to have a say in what happens next. Assuming his developmental delays don't prohibit him from having his own wishes about things, I think you should talk with your son before you do anything, and ask him would he like you to talk to his mum about his younger brother's behaviour. If he says yes then do, if he says no then respect his wishes and drop it.\n\n(edited for clarity)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At 14 he's old enough to say where he wants to be permanently living, have you considered that route? Your ex's husband sounds like s real tool.", "NTA\n\nThere's a reason, not just being closer in age, that Connor hangs out with Alissa mostly, and it seems to be Matthews behaviour and his father enabling.\n\nRegardless of Connor being in a wheelchair, Matthew needed repercussions of throwing a stone at him.

I don't love how you went to name calling, but I completely understand in the heat of the moment how frustration could get the better of you. NTA. Maybe have a conversation with both of them though to ensure that disagreements are being handled/overseen until Matthew is better at regulating his emotions. At 5, that's hard; what to a non disabled child could be a simple mistake or bruise could be much more serious for Connor.\n\n*Sorry if I've used the wrong terminology with regard to disabilities, I mean no offense.

I know people who would have gone off at him majorly. \n\nAnd not being funny, but your son having a rock thrown at him when he can\u2019t defend himself, is not \u2018roughhousing\u2019.

He *is* a classic jerk.", "NTA. Do not apologize to that guy. He, his son and your ex are all TAs.", "Thank you. So sorry to hear about how your father was treated. \n\nWhen random people belittle my son, I can usually just calmly tell them to stop it. But this is his brother (half brother) and he is only 5yro, so he can still be raised to treat his brother as an equal. I am terrified of my son spending every other week in a house where he isn't treates with respect.", "I agree. I hate to think that this is the kind of treatment Connor gets at their house. My ex and I don't have the best of relationships, so I am rarely at their house (other than to pick up the kids). I took Connor and Alissa home with me after the party (as was previously agreed) and talked to both of them. They both said this kind of thing \"doesn't happen often\". I'll talk to them more about it and call my ex to come over as well so that the 4 of us can decide how the kids feel in that family and how we can resolve it.", "Right! Since when does throwing a rock at someone constitute \u201cplaying\u201d?!", "My thoughts exactly. I'm not even angry at Matthew (obviously I am upset and was mad), because he is a small child who is pushing the boundaries of everything to try and find out what is acceptable and what isn't. \n\nI grew up with 4 brothers and my dad allowed a lot of roughhousing (\"settle it among yourselves\" kind of thing), but if threw an actual rock at one of my brothers, our dad would have lost his damn mind on me.", "A 5yo who's grown up his entire life with a sibling in a wheelchair should have learned a lot more a lot earlier in terms of compassion and accommodation for his brother. I work with young children and they understand a lot more than many adults give them credit for. If he can get away with throwing rocks at his brother while OP is there,  I have to wonder what's going on when he isn't.", "This is not good advice. For the sake of all the children, tensions between the parents and between the children need to be worked on and diffused, certainly not escalated by OP going nuclear and demanding full custody.", "Thank you. I 100% could have reacted better, agreed. It just felt (to me) like the new husband was defending Matthew's behaviour, saying that the kids were roughhousing. I get that siblings fight, but Matthew could have seriously injured Connor.", "It\u2019s not always what is said but HOW it is said.  If OP was calm and said it that\u2019s way different than hulking out.  And did the ex\u2019s husband say things I. A jolly way or was it more in that tone where you know it\u2019s a cutting remark?\n\nIt\u2019s not over-reacting to call out someone, unless you like flip a table at the same time.", "To be fair, I only suggested that we give the younger kids something to play with to lighten the mood of the party and keep them busy. I didn't discipline Matthew directly. I did tell the new husband that this wasn't jist roughhousing, because I had to defend my son, who had a rock thrown at him. \n\nBut I do see how my behavior was inapproprate in what you say. So thank you for the comment.", "To be fair, your son is old enough to decide not to go back to that house. I hope he\u2019s aware of that option being there. \ud83d\udda4", "My dad said he and his friends used to play \u201cgoonies\u201d, a game that had a group of kids opposite of each other on a hill and they threw rocks at each other. Even as a little kid I thought this was a dumb game.", "If your kid is being put in danger, it's a damn good reason to seek full custody of said child.", "I agree with you, actually. If there were signs of abuse, I would 100% file for full custody. \n\nI called my ex and she is coming over later today to discuss this with me and our kids. Connor asked to stay with me more, while Alissa likes things the way they are. So I'll talk to my wife and try to see if we can make an arrangement where Connor is at my place more than at hers. We'll see what we can agree on then. But I won't go full nuclear on her. She was a crappy wife (and I was a crappy husband), but she is a good mom and while I don't particularly like her husband, he is a good stepdad, and especially Alissa likes him a lot. It's not all black and white, yes, and coparenting is complicated.", "I get that and good on you for being a caring, protective father.", "He is aware of it, yes. I talked to both my kids about this yesterday and also called my ex to come over today so the 4 of us can discuss this.", "If a child is in danger, then yes it is. But in this case we have no reason to believe OP's child was or is actively endangered by anyone other than his 5 year old brother in an one off incident. Ex-husband's attitude is poor but that can clearly be better addressed without resorting to the court system. There are many steps that could and should be taken to resolve the issue, that do not involve going nuclear.\n\n(edited to expand point)", "This seems very reasonable and fair to everyone.", "A rock being thrown at someone who is incapable of even raising their arm to block it is most certainly dangerous.  I'd be mad if a five year old threw a rock at me and I CAN move my arms to defend it.  It's nothing to brush off and ignore, PARTICULARLY when the child's parent doesn't take that incident very seriously.", "Yeah, this is what bothered me the most. That Matthew's dad brushed it off. My ex is coming over later today and we'll try and talk this out.", "If she doubles down on her husband's idiocy, you may really want to consider going to court for full custody. You may regret it later if the kid who threw the rock begins to escalate his violent behavior."]}
