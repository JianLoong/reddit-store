I received a text from the clinic in advance confirming my appointment time and all the various details around fasting and whatnot. My husband (M30) and I made sure we arrived half an hour in advance in case there was paperwork or anything of the like, and I was all checked in with reception.\n\nThe doctor came out at what I thought was my scheduled appointment time, took me in to the examination room, and the biopsy went ahead with no issues. It was only when I was leaving that the doctor said that she would prefer if I phoned ahead next time if I was going to be two hours late so they can make sure no one is inconvenienced. I was very confused, and showed her the text message confirming my appointment time. She could clearly see that I had been on time, so she said that she would take it up with the lady who took the booking in the first place.\n\nWhen I headed up to reception to schedule the next appointment, the same receptionist was working as when I made the initial appointment, and I asked that she please clarify that the time I had booked was the time she had put in the system. She asked me what I meant, and I said that the confirmation text I had received told me a different time and the doctor said that I had been two hours late by their system. The receptionist said that this never happened, and I was in the middle of showing her the text when the doctor walked out again and the receptionist called her over.\n\nThe receptionist told the doctor I was accusing her of scheduling appointments incorrectly, but I clarified that I had only said that I came on time as per the text, but that I had been told that I was two hours late according to the doctor's system. The doctor confirmed my story, so I again asked that the receptionist please just check that the time I had and the time she had in her schedule was the same.\n\nThe receptionist started tearing up but confirmed that we both had the same time, so I thanked her and left. It was in the car on the way home that my husband told me he overheard the receptionist telling another patient that she had only been working at the clinic for two months, and he said I was a bit harsh on her given that she was new. I told him I disagreed and I wasn't rude or anything like that when chatting to her, but he said that I had let the stress of the situation get the better of me and that I should have just let it go, and not put so much pressure on the staff when they are still learning.\n\nI have now come to the internet for an independent opinion - was I the AH?", "created_utc": 1692779509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yxopq/aita_for_being_too_hard_on_a_new_receptionist/", "score": 385, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Next time you are there, apologize. Tell her that you were very stressed from the appointment and you did not mean to put her on the spot.

I work with physicians and their staff. By the second month, schedulers/front desk staff know how to correctly schedule patients. Your recounting of the exchange sounds more like you asked for clarification rather than shaming her.", "Does anyone else think that the doctor stuffed up here and got things mixed up? OP got a confirmation text and the receptionist confirmed the time was correct on her system to that of the text so the only person claiming OP was 2 hours late was the doctor. Maybe she got it mixed up.\nIt\u2019s very telling that the receptionist was tearing up, I bet the doctor is a nightmare to work for. I do think people can be a little unaware of when they are being rude to front desk staff. So maybe you were a bit harsh but maybe it\u2019s more on the staff atmosphere.", "NTA. Two months in she should know how to do basic scheduling and have trouble only with quirky things", "Thank you for your thoughts!

I don\u2019t know where you live, but where I live, but you are lucky the Dr. was able to see you.  I have had this happen before, only the Dr. Office changed my appointment time without telling me the did that.\n\nThey charged me $50.00 as a no show/no cancellation fee.

The doctor hopefully is paying close attention to how his staff treat patients as well as how many mistakes they make, how they deal with those mistakes and what their learning curve is. A medical office is not the place for people, either support staff or the medical professionals, who make sloppy mistakes.", "NTA \u201cOh I\u2019m so sorry I am new here. Thanks for letting me know. Let\u2019s look into this and make sure that everything is working properly.\u201d Is what she should have said.", "One of the things I try to remember is that the simple act of making someone cry does not necessarily mean you acted inappropriately towards them.

Just apologise to all involved and move on.", "Some people cry when they're stressed.  Sometimes it's manipulative, done to create sympathy and prevent discipline.  Sometimes it's just tears because that's the body's reaction.  Either way, her reaction to your reasonable question isn't your responsibility.", "Maybe NAH because I really understand wanting to chase down an error, but looking at the whole situation, I don't think you did the right thing. The doctor knew there was a miscommunication and was a lot better prepared to address it. And the error was not when she confirmed your time at the desk, it was in the text. So you double checking this wouldn't address the error. \n\nFor me the flag that makes me lean Y-T-A is that from your perspective, it's more than possible that the doctor made the error, but you've made the assumption it was the receptionist.", "If you were there at the time the text confirmation said -and it was the same time as when you made the appointment - but the doctor said you were late why would talk to reception about it & not just think the doctor was wrong? Not only ask reception, but do it several times when she had already confirmed you were there at the right time? \n\nDoctors are not infallible people, they make tons of mistakes. She could have remembered her schedule wrong or gotten you confused with someone else. \n\nI think all the Not comments are not seeing what actually happened.

I work in IT and sometimes weird stuff happens, it's more important to figure out what happened so that you know there isn't a software bug. You always would rather have the issue be human error than a software bug, because human error can be fixed quickly, a software bug could take weeks or months depending on the vendor.", "NTA.  You were just making sure the appointment times matched up.  If you weren't rude about it, I don't see the issue.  Her crying is not on you.  That's on her.  It was her mistake.

When you work in a medical office, there is NO room for mistakes.", "NTA", "Exactly. Plus the receptionist wasn't (presumably) wearing a sign that said \"I'M NEW!,\" to give any kind of clarity to her reaction. It's natural to want to ensure that your appointments are properly scheduled, whether it's routine or abnormal. Time is valuable for both you and the doctor.", "Yeah, a lot of scheduling systems send out those text reminders automatically. If the receptionist had it correct, and the text time was correct, and only the doctor was differing, I feel like he was the one who messed up.", "From what I understand, OP is asking the receptionist to double check the time for the next appointment she just scheduled. Not the one OP was attending.", "Agreed, the receptionist didn't make the mistake here. If her system showed the right time and the auto-text showed the right time, the doctor made a mistake. The receptionist being new is a red herring; she was right all along anyway.", "The receptionist is new and likely still on probation. Quite likely worried about being fired.", "Where would the doctor even get the idea that she was late unless told by the receptionist? Are you under the impression that doctors manage their own schedules?", "As someone who used to work in medical reception there have been so many instance\u2019s of someone telling my boss they were calm when they confrontare me. Yeah the video footage shows you screaming vile abuse at me mate.

But I still think the text would populate right from the system, and OP also presumably remembers whether that's the slot she was told when booking. I think the doctor just wasn't looking at the system and got mixed up.", "If she\u2019s that quick to cry over something so small, she should not be working in a medical office. A lot of patients are dealing with serious conditions or health concerns. Any staff working in the medical field need to stay calm, and rational. Probation periods are for learning and making mistakes, it\u2019s the best time to do so. \n\nNTA, OP. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s suited for the industry she\u2019s in.", "Not managing your own schedule doesn't mean you never look at your own schedule. Do doctors seriously not even know who's coming or why until the receptionist verbally tells them right before? I would imagine they look at something (either on paper or computer) to get an idea of what their day is going to be like. But if they don't, I guess it would explain that one I had a few years ago who had no idea why I was there lol.", "But it feels manipulative, so it is inappropriate. Some people yell when they're stressed. That is not appropriate. Crying when stressed in public is equally inappropriate. It garners sympathy in a manipulative way, and turns public opinion unfairly in the crying person's favor.", "You don't seem to get that people cannot always control this reaction.", "Crying can just be a biological response. Should people also not blush in public? The key to dealing with a crying person, in most cases, is just to keep talking to them as if they weren't. They probably don't want to be.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't harsh.  You explained what happened, and got corroboration from the Doctor.\n\nAnd because of the mix-up you wanted to confirm it wouldn't happen again.", "NTA - if what you say happened happened as you say it did, you did nothing wrong", "NTA - So what if she was new, she screwed it up and how will she ever learn unless called out on her mistakes?", "NTA how were you to know she's 'new' was she wearing a 'trainee' badge? no. this was a major screw up on her part. the fact she flat out denied the mistake  put her irredeemably in the wrong and justified your doubling down on her.\n\nhad she said 'I'm so sorry that happened\"etc you might have been too hard but her denial of the initial mistake makes your concerns beyond valid.", "Often times with biopsies you need to be there 1 or 2 hours prior. So if your appt was at 10 you need to be there at 8. Most likely this is the issue and the receptionist has nothing to do with the automated texts.", "YTA. You made the doctor aware of what happened, it was his job to go check in with the receptionist and let her know she made a mistake, not yours. \n\nThe doctor saying \"I will take it up with the lady who made the booking\" is not an invitation for you to confront the one who made the mistake, the doctor doesn't need your help managing her staff.", "it all hinges on your tone.

But you can\u2019t take that interaction into your conversation with the next customer. You step away if you can to get ahold of yourself and you put your customer service face back on and help the next person in line to the best of your ability. I imagine it was very uncomfortable for the other patient to have to hear about something that she wasn\u2019t involved in at all.", "The receptionist was probably more emotional over being chastised by the doctor, not OP. Even if OP was irate, that's something that receptionists unfortunately have to deal with sometimes. But being chewed out by your boss for screwing up is far more upsetting, especially when you just told the patient that it didn't happen. I think what is more likely is that the receptionist told the doctor the wrong time. Those appointment text reminders are usually on an automatic system that takes it's info from the calendar. But the daily schedule for the doctor is more likely to be done my a human and someone probably screwed up there.", "OP was checking the NEXT appointment was correct.

Crying is only an involuntary response for babies and people that don't bother to practice.  It is the same as learning to cover your mouth when you sneeze, or not farting in public. \n\nIf strong emotions strike, and tears start to well in your eyes, the respectful thing to do is excuse yourself to go cry in private. The same as if you feel like yelling in public - instead of yelling, excuse yourself or count to 10, etc. \n\nJust crying in public is very awkward and rude. It forces people into your drama, the same way yelling in public does.", "I'm an angry/frustrated crier too, it is a super inconvenient biological response to stress.", "I really don't. I think it's more that people don't have that cultural standard anymore. People could control it 20 years ago, why is it all of a sudden acceptable for everyone to cry in public now? \n\nPeople only think they can't control it because they haven't tried hard enough.", "You don\u2019t get to control others because of your preferences and beliefs. Just because you believe something to be true doesn\u2019t mean it is and the world isn\u2019t going to cater to you to help manage your reactions to other people.", "You also probably didn\u2019t know then that there are chemicals released in stress tears that are not present in tears from other causes. \n\nDo you also think that men don\u2019t cry at all either? Because that was a common belief 20 years ago too. That if a man cried for any reason he wasn\u2019t a real man. \n\nYour reaction to her physiological response is her problem. You need to manage your responses better if you treat people as less than for that. \n\nPS, they couldn\u2019t always control it 20 years ago. The polite response when someone is crying that you don\u2019t know well like that is to ignore it and just continue the conversation.", "Not controlling anyone. Just judging and avoiding accordingly. Nobody has to cater to me, and I don't have to cater to their crying either.", "I do know about the chemicals. That's why crying in private is healthy. Or in socially appropriate contexts, like a funeral, or a wedding. But just crying in public in front of strangers would force people to feel my feelings, and they don't deserve that. They deserve to go about their day feeling their own feelings instead of feeling sorry for the crying person. \n\nI agree the polite thing to do when someone cries awkwardly in public is to ignore it and continue the conversation around them. It's very awkward, but that is the right thing to do. However, if they cry in public too often, I will just stop hanging out with them.", "NAH, if you were calm and rational as you say.\n\nI will say, though, if the text reminder didn't match the scheduled appointment, it probably was not a scheduling error on the receptionist's part. Those texts are automated. If she scheduled you for the wrong time, the text reminder would have been for that incorrect time. This was more than likely an IT issue.

How are you supposed to be sure you will end up on time if you don't have her recheck? She wouldn't recheck, so you had to point out why it was required. Pretty straight forward.", "Nta, if you don't tell them they did something wrong how will they know and learn?", "Two months is more than enough time to learn how to schedule an appointment.  It\u2019s not hard.  NTA", "NTA, you were literally just clarifying. Everyone can make mistakes, and you were just covering your own ass and the receptionist\u2019s ass by double checking the time. If she wants to make that a big deal and cry about it, well she\u2019s more than welcome to do so.", "NTA you didn't even act in an accusatory way you just asked to double check before leaving", "NTA and two months isn't really that new.", "NTA. But I\u2019ve known people who work in doctors offices and doctors never admit it was them who made the error.", "NTA, especially when there can be such hefty consequences now when arriving late to medical appointments. She has one job and, through whatever issues convalesced to create this situation, she didn't do it correctly this time. You were calm and respectful.", "I can\u2019t comment on this. Wtf is going on in your husband\u2019s head? She messed up. You said nothing wrong. Is he that easily swayed by tears? If so, just cry at him until he apologizes. NTA", "She's crying.  Come on!", "I\u2019ve worked in reception for 6 years.  Even as a newbie, I\u2019ve never scheduled someone for 2 hours later and honestly would\u2019ve called customers ahead of time for confirmation anyways.  Literally not even close to the worst patients have said to me.", "NTA.  Two months, her main job task is literally to book appointments and she can't do it right?  Some people really take the cake.\n\nMy old company had a policy that admins had to book our travel.  I asked for a flight, car and hotel in Greenville NC.  Our ditzy admin booked them to Greenville SC.  When I pointed out her error, she suggested I just drive from the wrong one to the right one.  I told her no... because it's a FIVE HOUR DRIVE.", "My other concern is it should have shown on the receptionist who checked OP in that they were late - I'm assuming they're using electronic systems for check ins and such (especially if they're sending appointment times) so if they were 2 hours late the scheduled would have shown that when they went to check OP in and then there would have been an issue before getting to the doctor.\n\nNot saying OP is an a h bc I'm sure she felt stressed concerning this appointment and didn't want to be late again, but I'm with you about there maybe being more to this than the receptionist screwing up.", "That\u2019s why I thought YTA. As she doesn\u2019t know who is the reason for the fault. But she stood there demanding the receptionist prove herself.", "It sounds like the doctor messed up, not the receptionist. Dr is the only one with the \u201cwrong\u201d time, OP and the receptionist both had the same time. \n\nEither there\u2019s an issue with their calendaring system or dr made a mistake and got the appointment time wrong. I\u2019ve also been a receptionist and will cover for ours when they\u2019re out, I\u2019ve never seen an instance when a patient/client is allowed to proceed after being two hours late to their appointment. It seems like dr messed up and then doubled down in front of the receptionist, passing the buck to her.", "OP was asking about her NEXT appointment to confirm that she had the correct time in their system instead of relying on the texting system. I've had the text time been incorrect before so I always write it down and put it into my phone when I make appointments now.", "Her letting her emotions \"get the better of her\" (to use your husband's language, although I personally would use other words) does not equal you having let your emotions get the better of you.", "I commented above, but if OP was 2 hours late I feel like that would have been caught during her check in.", "The doctors vs the receptionists systems may  be linked. Medical scheduling tech can be quite antiquated. \n\nDoctors generally are seeing dzoens of patients in a day so itd be unusual of the doctor got the appt wrong unless somehing was written wrong. Most dont even know when a patient is booked. They just keep seeing the next pt on their list. If they noticed something is likely off. \n\nSource: As a physician whos worked with horrible medical records and receptionists who book things incorrectly all the time...", "What? It seemed pretty clear it wad about this appointment.. she said she showed the receptionist her text that showed she was on time vs 2 hrs late.", "Sadly true. That's the case for a lot of these AITAs so always hard to judge.", "But there is a good chance it wasn\u2019t even the receptionists mistake! We don\u2019t know the booking system. The text would have gone off what the booking system had in it at reception. But something in their system messed up. Whether it\u2019s the receptionist putting it over or something else, we don\u2019t know how it works. So getting blamed for something you might not have done on the spot is not nice at all.", "Like I said that can be done in a follow up! She also doesn\u2019t know how the times got messed up. All she was trying to do was shame the receptionist. They have both said that\u2019s the time she was booking. But she was demanding the receptionist prove it to her. That\u2019s a dick move. If she was anxious it happened again she could have followed up when she got the reminder text etc\u2026 but she stood there demanding it. And she doesn\u2019t even know why the mess up happened in the first place. There are many reasons for booking errors. She wanted to shame her and blame her and that\u2019s what she did publicly!", "She is making another appointment and confirming the date/time. Waiting until a reminder text, which usually comes the day before the appointment and at that point can't be changed, is stupid.", "And you're imagining that in this entire unoccupied hour, the doctor never once double checks the schedule? I mean OK.", "Uh.. no.. crying is not controllable in every circumstance... have you never chopped onions? Take a whiff and literally noone would be able to stop tearing up there. \n\nThis is overly macho nonsense that people can just stop crying at will. \n\nEmotions are a thing. Expressing them happens. Its nothing like yelling.  Can you cry on demand as well? Pretty sure you cant therefore its also not like yelling. \n\nLike this isnt uncommon. Multitudes of tv and movies have people say things like \"i promised i wouldnt cry\" during a wedding or a break up or something. A reddit meme is \"im not crying youre crying\" or \"whos cutting onions\". People wouldnt say those things if they can just not cry.", "Do you think that in this case the receptionist could have walked away? A client was talking to them and they still needed to do their job, they cannot just get up and leave. \n\nIt is not always possible to stop tears from coming out and you cannot always distance yourself from a situation. While keeping your mouth shut to count to 10 is usually possible. Also people fart in public, it is a normal bodily function people often do unconsciously", "And you assume how their system works! There are many ways doctors offices schedule appointments. She can be one of many receptionists and they can use an online system for part of it. Many doctors do. It\u2019s up to the office to find where the mistake happened and address it."]}
