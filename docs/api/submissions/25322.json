I received a text from the clinic in advance confirming my appointment time and all the various details around fasting and whatnot. My husband (M30) and I made sure we arrived half an hour in advance in case there was paperwork or anything of the like, and I was all checked in with reception.\n\nThe doctor came out at what I thought was my scheduled appointment time, took me in to the examination room, and the biopsy went ahead with no issues. It was only when I was leaving that the doctor said that she would prefer if I phoned ahead next time if I was going to be two hours late so they can make sure no one is inconvenienced. I was very confused, and showed her the text message confirming my appointment time. She could clearly see that I had been on time, so she said that she would take it up with the lady who took the booking in the first place.\n\nWhen I headed up to reception to schedule the next appointment, the same receptionist was working as when I made the initial appointment, and I asked that she please clarify that the time I had booked was the time she had put in the system. She asked me what I meant, and I said that the confirmation text I had received told me a different time and the doctor said that I had been two hours late by their system. The receptionist said that this never happened, and I was in the middle of showing her the text when the doctor walked out again and the receptionist called her over.\n\nThe receptionist told the doctor I was accusing her of scheduling appointments incorrectly, but I clarified that I had only said that I came on time as per the text, but that I had been told that I was two hours late according to the doctor's system. The doctor confirmed my story, so I again asked that the receptionist please just check that the time I had and the time she had in her schedule was the same.\n\nThe receptionist started tearing up but confirmed that we both had the same time, so I thanked her and left. It was in the car on the way home that my husband told me he overheard the receptionist telling another patient that she had only been working at the clinic for two months, and he said I was a bit harsh on her given that she was new. I told him I disagreed and I wasn't rude or anything like that when chatting to her, but he said that I had let the stress of the situation get the better of me and that I should have just let it go, and not put so much pressure on the staff when they are still learning.\n\nI have now come to the internet for an independent opinion - was I the AH?", "created_utc": 1692779509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yxopq/aita_for_being_too_hard_on_a_new_receptionist/", "score": 280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Next time you are there, apologize. Tell her that you were very stressed from the appointment and you did not mean to put her on the spot.

You weren't screaming at her or being rude, so this may just be a learning moment for her. We all mess up at work sometimes, and it's embarassing when it's public, but we have to just learn from it.", "NTA You were fine with asking and everything.\nShe is new and will make mistakes and if no one tells her she made a mistake, how will she improve", "NAH as long as you weren\u2019t rude about it. But she\u2019s not an A either. It\u2019s really easy to mix up stuff like that and being new she prob felt bad.", "NTA, as a secretary who is in charge of appointments etc it's her responsibility to make sure that what she has, the patient has and the doctor has are all the same. \n\nThis is literally my job and she cannot blame anyone else, she seems to be scapegoating", "NTA. I work with physicians and their staff. By the second month, schedulers/front desk staff know how to correctly schedule patients. Your recounting of the exchange sounds more like you asked for clarification rather than shaming her.", "Does anyone else think that the doctor stuffed up here and got things mixed up? OP got a confirmation text and the receptionist confirmed the time was correct on her system to that of the text so the only person claiming OP was 2 hours late was the doctor. Maybe she got it mixed up.\nIt\u2019s very telling that the receptionist was tearing up, I bet the doctor is a nightmare to work for. I do think people can be a little unaware of when they are being rude to front desk staff. So maybe you were a bit harsh but maybe it\u2019s more on the staff atmosphere.", "NTA. Two months in she should know how to do basic scheduling and have trouble only with quirky things", "Thank you for your thoughts! My husband agreed that I was not rude, but used the receptionist crying as the justification for me having let my emotions get the better of me and going to far.", "I didn\u2019t think that until you said it, and now I agree. Also the doctor came over at the exact moment the receptionist started looking into her system. I don\u2019t really think that information changes much of anything, and I\u2019m going to go with a very soft YTA to OP for not letting the office take care of the issue on their own, but just barely.", "You weren\u2019t rude at all especially since you were seeing the Dr. for a serious test with possible life changing consequences. I don\u2019t know where you live, but where I live, but you are lucky the Dr. was able to see you.  I have had this happen before, only the Dr. Office changed my appointment time without telling me the did that.\n\nThey charged me $50.00 as a no show/no cancellation fee. Since they don\u2019t send reminder texts I was lucky I still had my appointment card, but it still took 5 months and hours on the phone to get the charge canceled.\n\nYes the receptionist in new but with 2 months on the job this shouldn\u2019t have happened.

The doctor hopefully is paying close attention to how his staff treat patients as well as how many mistakes they make, how they deal with those mistakes and what their learning curve is. A medical office is not the place for people, either support staff or the medical professionals, who make sloppy mistakes.", "NTA \u201cOh I\u2019m so sorry I am new here. Thanks for letting me know. Let\u2019s look into this and make sure that everything is working properly.\u201d Is what she should have said.", "One of the things I try to remember is that the simple act of making someone cry does not necessarily mean you acted inappropriately towards them. Sometimes people just cry. As long as you weren\u2019t rude or belligerent I don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about here.", "I worked in a similar job once, and yeah. Mistakes happen. Just apologise to all involved and move on.", "Some people cry when they're stressed.  Sometimes it's manipulative, done to create sympathy and prevent discipline.  Sometimes it's just tears because that's the body's reaction.  Either way, her reaction to your reasonable question isn't your responsibility.", "Maybe NAH because I really understand wanting to chase down an error, but looking at the whole situation, I don't think you did the right thing. The doctor knew there was a miscommunication and was a lot better prepared to address it. And the error was not when she confirmed your time at the desk, it was in the text. So you double checking this wouldn't address the error. \n\nFor me the flag that makes me lean Y-T-A is that from your perspective, it's more than possible that the doctor made the error, but you've made the assumption it was the receptionist.", "If you were there at the time the text confirmation said -and it was the same time as when you made the appointment - but the doctor said you were late why would talk to reception about it & not just think the doctor was wrong? Not only ask reception, but do it several times when she had already confirmed you were there at the right time? \n\nDoctors are not infallible people, they make tons of mistakes. She could have remembered her schedule wrong or gotten you confused with someone else. \n\nI think all the Not comments are not seeing what actually happened. No, maybe you weren't rude or anything but you kept at it after the receptionist said you were correct the 1st time. That's not okay. \n\nYTA", "Nta. 2 months is more than enough time to learn the appt system. You didn\u2019t yell or anything, you just wanted to confirm that things were correct in the future.", "New employees aren't allowed to mess things up just because they are new. If they do, they should apologize, take accountability, and fix the issue. How long can you be incompetent and blame it on new without making any changes to improve?", "100% NTA....the dr even came over and explained to her what was going on. She sounds over sensitive. 2 months is plenty long enough to figure out scheduling appointments.", "NTA, the staff should accommodate the patients, not the other way around.", "NTA.", "NTA. I work in IT and sometimes weird stuff happens, it's more important to figure out what happened so that you know there isn't a software bug. You always would rather have the issue be human error than a software bug, because human error can be fixed quickly, a software bug could take weeks or months depending on the vendor.", "NTA.  You were just making sure the appointment times matched up.  If you weren't rude about it, I don't see the issue.  Her crying is not on you.  That's on her.  It was her mistake.  I'm sure she still has a lot to learn, but scheduling is probably the first thing she learned & the thing she does the most.  So, after 2 months, she s/b better at it.  When you work in a medical office, there is NO room for mistakes.", "NTA", "Exactly. Plus the receptionist wasn't (presumably) wearing a sign that said \"I'M NEW!,\" to give any kind of clarity to her reaction. It's natural to want to ensure that your appointments are properly scheduled, whether it's routine or abnormal. Time is valuable for both you and the doctor.", "Yeah, a lot of scheduling systems send out those text reminders automatically. If the receptionist had it correct, and the text time was correct, and only the doctor was differing, I feel like he was the one who messed up.", "From what I understand, OP is asking the receptionist to double check the time for the next appointment she just scheduled. Not the one OP was attending.", "Agreed, the receptionist didn't make the mistake here. If her system showed the right time and the auto-text showed the right time, the doctor made a mistake. The receptionist being new is a red herring; she was right all along anyway.", "The receptionist is new and likely still on probation. Quite likely worried about being fired.", "Where would the doctor even get the idea that she was late unless told by the receptionist? Are you under the impression that doctors manage their own schedules?", "As someone who used to work in medical reception there have been so many instance\u2019s of someone telling my boss they were calm when they confrontare me. Yeah the video footage shows you screaming vile abuse at me mate. So I really take it with a grain of salt when someone claims they were calm and rational and they don\u2019t know why the receptionists cried.", "The receptionist is new and likely worried about being fired while on probation.", "As I read it, op asked her to check that the next date is right in the system - which is completely legitimate", "Point taken. But I still think the text would populate right from the system, and OP also presumably remembers whether that's the slot she was told when booking. I think the doctor just wasn't looking at the system and got mixed up.", "If she\u2019s that quick to cry over something so small, she should not be working in a medical office. A lot of patients are dealing with serious conditions or health concerns. Any staff working in the medical field need to stay calm, and rational. Probation periods are for learning and making mistakes, it\u2019s the best time to do so. \n\nNTA, OP. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s suited for the industry she\u2019s in.", "Not managing your own schedule doesn't mean you never look at your own schedule. Do doctors seriously not even know who's coming or why until the receptionist verbally tells them right before? I would imagine they look at something (either on paper or computer) to get an idea of what their day is going to be like. But if they don't, I guess it would explain that one I had a few years ago who had no idea why I was there lol.", "But it feels manipulative, so it is inappropriate. Some people yell when they're stressed. That is not appropriate. Crying when stressed in public is equally inappropriate. It garners sympathy in a manipulative way, and turns public opinion unfairly in the crying person's favor.", "You don't seem to get that people cannot always control this reaction.", "Crying can just be a biological response. Should people also not blush in public? The key to dealing with a crying person, in most cases, is just to keep talking to them as if they weren't. They probably don't want to be.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't harsh.  You explained what happened, and got corroboration from the Doctor.\n\nAnd because of the mix-up you wanted to confirm it wouldn't happen again.", "NTA - if what you say happened happened as you say it did, you did nothing wrong", "NTA - So what if she was new, she screwed it up and how will she ever learn unless called out on her mistakes?", "NTA how were you to know she's 'new' was she wearing a 'trainee' badge? no. this was a major screw up on her part. the fact she flat out denied the mistake  put her irredeemably in the wrong and justified your doubling down on her.\n\nhad she said 'I'm so sorry that happened\"etc you might have been too hard but her denial of the initial mistake makes your concerns beyond valid.", "Often times with biopsies you need to be there 1 or 2 hours prior. So if your appt was at 10 you need to be there at 8. Most likely this is the issue and the receptionist has nothing to do with the automated texts.", "YTA. You made the doctor aware of what happened, it was his job to go check in with the receptionist and let her know she made a mistake, not yours. \n\nThe doctor saying \"I will take it up with the lady who made the booking\" is not an invitation for you to confront the one who made the mistake, the doctor doesn't need your help managing her staff.", "it all hinges on your tone. I might personally have said, \u201comg technology is so annoying!! the text I got wasn\u2019t my actual appointment time, isn\u2019t that crazy? is there anything either of us can do to prevent that next time?\u201d but politely saying \u201cpls double check\u201d isn\u2019t terrible. she was probably embarrassed, understandably. \n\nNAH", "Nta lots of time the texts are sent via a text system. If the system is messing up, they need to know to fix it!", "NTA", "but politely saying \u201cpls double check\u201d isn\u2019t terrible. she was probably embarrassed, understandably.", "I agree with this, and I\u2019ll also say it was really unprofessional for the employee to talk about it with another patient. \n\nI\u2019ve never worked in a medical office, but I did customer service for years, and yes, sometimes customer interactions made me cry. But you can\u2019t take that interaction into your conversation with the next customer. You step away if you can to get ahold of yourself and you put your customer service face back on and help the next person in line to the best of your ability. I imagine it was very uncomfortable for the other patient to have to hear about something that she wasn\u2019t involved in at all.", "The receptionist was probably more emotional over being chastised by the doctor, not OP. Even if OP was irate, that's something that receptionists unfortunately have to deal with sometimes. But being chewed out by your boss for screwing up is far more upsetting, especially when you just told the patient that it didn't happen. I think what is more likely is that the receptionist told the doctor the wrong time. Those appointment text reminders are usually on an automatic system that takes it's info from the calendar. But the daily schedule for the doctor is more likely to be done my a human and someone probably screwed up there.", "OP was checking the NEXT appointment was correct. That's not something you do later.", "I cry anytime I'm stressed or have too many emotions. I would probably have cried in this situation. It doesn't make you an AH for correcting her.", "Her management of her emotions is not your fault or responsibility.", "Bot", "OP was checking that her follow up appointment was inputted correctly. It is her issue because she's the one who can lose out on that next appointment if that one also gets screwed up in the system. She's nta at all for being proactive.", "[removed]", "That appointment was probably filled with a lot of nerves and anxiety for you.NAT", "What I'm saying is that whatever the doctor looks at was, in some fashion, prepared by the receptionist.", "I cry when I\u2019m frustrated. I cry when I\u2019m pissed off. I cry when I\u2019m stressed out. I cry when I have a panic attack. None of that is within my control, and I highly doubt the receptionist had any control of her emotions in that moment, either.", "But that doesn't mean the doctor can't make a mistake after looking at it. \n\nThe doctor could have looked at a schedule hours ago that says \"Mary Smith, 9am, Bob Johnson, 10am, May Smith 11am,\" then, idk, Mary no-shows, OP is May, turns up at 11 as scheduled and the doctor gets mixed up.", "Yeah people can control crying with practice, so I consider it closer to yelling than blushing. Crying is only an involuntary response for babies and people that don't bother to practice.  It is the same as learning to cover your mouth when you sneeze, or not farting in public. \n\nIf strong emotions strike, and tears start to well in your eyes, the respectful thing to do is excuse yourself to go cry in private. The same as if you feel like yelling in public - instead of yelling, excuse yourself or count to 10, etc. \n\nJust crying in public is very awkward and rude. It forces people into your drama, the same way yelling in public does.", "I'm an angry/frustrated crier too, it is a super inconvenient biological response to stress.", "I really don't. I think it's more that people don't have that cultural standard anymore. People could control it 20 years ago, why is it all of a sudden acceptable for everyone to cry in public now? \n\nPeople only think they can't control it because they haven't tried hard enough.", "You don\u2019t get to control others because of your preferences and beliefs. Just because you believe something to be true doesn\u2019t mean it is and the world isn\u2019t going to cater to you to help manage your reactions to other people.", "You also probably didn\u2019t know then that there are chemicals released in stress tears that are not present in tears from other causes. \n\nDo you also think that men don\u2019t cry at all either? Because that was a common belief 20 years ago too. That if a man cried for any reason he wasn\u2019t a real man. \n\nYour reaction to her physiological response is her problem. You need to manage your responses better if you treat people as less than for that. \n\nPS, they couldn\u2019t always control it 20 years ago. The polite response when someone is crying that you don\u2019t know well like that is to ignore it and just continue the conversation.", "Not controlling anyone. Just judging and avoiding accordingly. Nobody has to cater to me, and I don't have to cater to their crying either.", "I do know about the chemicals. That's why crying in private is healthy. Or in socially appropriate contexts, like a funeral, or a wedding. But just crying in public in front of strangers would force people to feel my feelings, and they don't deserve that. They deserve to go about their day feeling their own feelings instead of feeling sorry for the crying person. \n\nI agree the polite thing to do when someone cries awkwardly in public is to ignore it and continue the conversation around them. It's very awkward, but that is the right thing to do. However, if they cry in public too often, I will just stop hanging out with them."]}
