Obviously this was not a pleasant surprise, but they have been really great so far about getting all of my tests lined up so we can have some kind of game plan in place.\n\nYesterday, I had a biopsy scheduled. I received a text from the clinic in advance confirming my appointment time and all the various details around fasting and whatnot. My husband (M30) and I made sure we arrived half an hour in advance in case there was paperwork or anything of the like, and I was all checked in with reception.\n\nThe doctor came out at what I thought was my scheduled appointment time, took me in to the examination room, and the biopsy went ahead with no issues. It was only when I was leaving that the doctor said that she would prefer if I phoned ahead next time if I was going to be two hours late so they can make sure no one is inconvenienced. I was very confused, and showed her the text message confirming my appointment time. She could clearly see that I had been on time, so she said that she would take it up with the lady who took the booking in the first place.\n\nWhen I headed up to reception to schedule the next appointment, the same receptionist was working as when I made the initial appointment, and I asked that she please clarify that the time I had booked was the time she had put in the system. She asked me what I meant, and I said that the confirmation text I had received told me a different time and the doctor said that I had been two hours late by their system. The receptionist said that this never happened, and I was in the middle of showing her the text when the doctor walked out again and the receptionist called her over.\n\nThe receptionist told the doctor I was accusing her of scheduling appointments incorrectly, but I clarified that I had only said that I came on time as per the text, but that I had been told that I was two hours late according to the doctor's system. The doctor confirmed my story, so I again asked that the receptionist please just check that the time I had and the time she had in her schedule was the same.\n\nThe receptionist started tearing up but confirmed that we both had the same time, so I thanked her and left. It was in the car on the way home that my husband told me he overheard the receptionist telling another patient that she had only been working at the clinic for two months, and he said I was a bit harsh on her given that she was new. I told him I disagreed and I wasn't rude or anything like that when chatting to her, but he said that I had let the stress of the situation get the better of me and that I should have just let it go, and not put so much pressure on the staff when they are still learning.\n\nI have now come to the internet for an independent opinion - was I the AH?", "created_utc": 1692779509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yxopq/aita_for_being_too_hard_on_a_new_receptionist/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You weren't rude, you simply stated the truth, even if she's new, 2 months is a lot of time to get your game together and know how things operate in a clinic.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you screamed at her or anything you simply asked to confirm the time so it doesn\u2019t happen in the future. Sounds like you handled it fine. You didn\u2019t even blame or accuse you stated a fact. Working a job for 2 months is not that new.", "NTA - if you were as calm and courteous as your writing portrays you to be. You were made aware of a discrepancy, you took extra steps to ensure it's not a repeat occurance. You didn't yell, you didn't insult, you didn't make a scene. You even didn't place fault on the receptionist, but just referred to the descrepancy as an event, not a thing directly caused by them.", " NTA. \n\nIt sounds like you were really reasonable given the stress you must be under.\n\nMaking mistakes happens, especially when your new. \n\nI find it curious that she was so emotional about something so minor.", "NTA. Two months is MORE than enough time to learn the system central to doing one's job.", "NTA. I'm a medical receptionist and sometimes we make mistakes, we are human. You did not become abusive, you did not swear at her, raise your voice etc. You handled this exactly as it needed to be handled. If I were the receptionist I would have said how sorry I was and that I would triple check the information this time to ensure it was all correct. She is going to need tougher skin if this is something that made her cry.", "I'm going to need to hear the receptionist's version of this. What you describe is yourself acting perfectly calm, rational, and reasonable...but the receptionist is tearing up and your boyfriend is saying you were too hard on her. And the doctor ends up being called over to mediate your investigation. Perhaps you heard yourself one way while everyone else was hearing you in a very different way.", "NTA. You needed to know you had the right time.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nProbably an unpopular opinion, but the doctor said they would talk to the receptionist. That should have been the end of it. By talking to her, in front of the other patients, staff, etc at the receptionist window, you did publically what the doctor, or probably office manager, would have done privately. If this had been the second time she did this, I could understand being frustrated, but accidents happen and doctor's offices are hectic places at the best of times.\n\nSuggestion. Next time you are there, apologize. Tell her that you were very stressed from the appointment and you did not mean to put her on the spot. Having been in her shoes, this will go a long way to making her day. Working reception is HARD, and most people underestimate what goes into those positions.\n\nI hope your tests come back ok, that is an extremely stressful situation.", "I actually think YTA. \n\nNot because she is new or anything like that. But just because the doctor already knew so could already handle the issue. You could have followed up with a comment \u201cdoctor mentioned an issue with booking times so might be something to check\u201d or an email later saying similar. But putting her on the spot to prove what the difference was didn\u2019t achieve anything but shaming her and making you feel better. \n\nI\u2019d have just left it with the doctor to follow up. As it messed their schedule up more and they can understand where the issue happened and provide the appropriate corrections.", "2 months as a medical receptionist is long enough to know what to do.  Yes they are bloody hectic, and yes  everyone makes mistakes, definitely,  but acknowledge them.", "I'm just stunned that the Dr saw you anyway considering you missed your appointment...esh", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You weren't screaming at her or being rude, so this may just be a learning moment for her. We all mess up at work sometimes, and it's embarassing when it's public, but we have to just learn from it.", "NTA You were fine with asking and everything.\nShe is new and will make mistakes and if no one tells her she made a mistake, how will she improve", "NAH as long as you weren\u2019t rude about it. But she\u2019s not an A either. It\u2019s really easy to mix up stuff like that and being new she prob felt bad.", "NTA, as a secretary who is in charge of appointments etc it's her responsibility to make sure that what she has, the patient has and the doctor has are all the same. \n\nThis is literally my job and she cannot blame anyone else, she seems to be scapegoating", "NTA. I work with physicians and their staff. By the second month, schedulers/front desk staff know how to correctly schedule patients. Your recounting of the exchange sounds more like you asked for clarification rather than shaming her.", "Does anyone else think that the doctor stuffed up here and got things mixed up? OP got a confirmation text and the receptionist confirmed the time was correct on her system to that of the text so the only person claiming OP was 2 hours late was the doctor. Maybe she got it mixed up.\nIt\u2019s very telling that the receptionist was tearing up, I bet the doctor is a nightmare to work for. I do think people can be a little unaware of when they are being rude to front desk staff. So maybe you were a bit harsh but maybe it\u2019s more on the staff atmosphere.", "NTA. Two months in she should know how to do basic scheduling and have trouble only with quirky things", "Thank you for your thoughts! My husband agreed that I was not rude, but used the receptionist crying as the justification for me having let my emotions get the better of me and going to far.", "I didn\u2019t think that until you said it, and now I agree. Also the doctor came over at the exact moment the receptionist started looking into her system. I don\u2019t really think that information changes much of anything, and I\u2019m going to go with a very soft YTA to OP for not letting the office take care of the issue on their own, but just barely.", "You weren\u2019t rude at all especially since you were seeing the Dr. for a serious test with possible life changing consequences. I don\u2019t know where you live, but where I live, but you are lucky the Dr. was able to see you.  I have had this happen before, only the Dr. Office changed my appointment time without telling me the did that.\n\nThey charged me $50.00 as a no show/no cancellation fee. Since they don\u2019t send reminder texts I was lucky I still had my appointment card, but it still took 5 months and hours on the phone to get the charge canceled.\n\nYes the receptionist in new but with 2 months on the job this shouldn\u2019t have happened.  I really hope everything will be when you get the results of the biopsy.  Sending positive thoughts. \ud83d\ude00", "Is he generally uncomfortable around people (or maybe just women) crying?\n \nIf so, my next question would be around: is his mum a weeper - does she cry to get her own way?\n\nMaybe not, but if he agrees you were calm & polite, but still thinks you should have behaved differently to avoid the tears, then I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s been conditioned by someone to do that\u2026", "NTA and she shouldn't be upset either way, sounds like it was a human error and could have happened to anyone.", "NTA to double verify the next appointment but maybe a little over the top *until* the clerk started denying & lying about having made a mistake previously. The doctor hopefully is paying close attention to how his staff treat patients as well as how many mistakes they make, how they deal with those mistakes and what their learning curve is. A medical office is not the place for people, either support staff or the medical professionals, who make sloppy mistakes.", "NTA \u201cOh I\u2019m so sorry I am new here. Thanks for letting me know. Let\u2019s look into this and make sure that everything is working properly.\u201d Is what she should have said.", "One of the things I try to remember is that the simple act of making someone cry does not necessarily mean you acted inappropriately towards them. Sometimes people just cry. As long as you weren\u2019t rude or belligerent I don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about here.", "I worked in a similar job once, and yeah. Mistakes happen. Just apologise to all involved and move on.", "Some people cry when they're stressed.  Sometimes it's manipulative, done to create sympathy and prevent discipline.  Sometimes it's just tears because that's the body's reaction.  Either way, her reaction to your reasonable question isn't your responsibility."]}
