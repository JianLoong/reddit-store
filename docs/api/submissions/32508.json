Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n > 1. The action I took that should be judged is refusing to lend my car to Jack, a friend in need, despite knowing he has a family with three kids and is currently facing car troubles. Instead of offering direct help, I suggested alternatives like renting a car or using a rideshare service, which may have come across as less accommodating given Jack's family situation. The judgment would revolve around whether my decision was justified, considering the concerns about potential damage to my new car and Jack's history with borrowed items, versus the apparent need of a friend facing challenges with his family.\n\n2.Refusing to lend my car to Jack despite his genuine need, especially with a family and three kids in the mix, might make me seem inconsiderate and unsupportive. The decision could be perceived as prioritizing the condition of my new car over helping a friend in a tough situation. By suggesting alternatives instead of directly assisting Jack, I may come across as unwilling to go the extra mile for someone I've known for a long time. The lack of flexibility and empathy, especially in the context of Jack's family needs, could be viewed as a selfish act, potentially earning me the label of being inconsiderate or the \"asshole\" in this situation.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your concern is real. Jack is acting very entitled to your car when he is not. He can ask to borrow your car but when you said no that should have been the end.", "NTA. Jack can just get over it. He's obviously set a precedent for not properly taking care of other people's property. He's an adult. He can pay for a rental if he truly needs to get around. He was just hoping to take the cheap and easy route thru you. I would never put my friends in such a position.", "NTA. A friend should be able to understand your concerns here, and playing the family card seems manipulative, IMO, especially given that you offered to help in other ways.", "NTA\n\nYeah, just what you want for your new vehicle, a careless driver and a trio of booger wipers, spillers and dirty feet kicking the back of your seats.\n\nHard no, and Jack can find someone else to try and guilt trip.  Hopefully someone with an old POS Buick or something.", "NTA. Jack is.\n\nLok, stop questioning yourself. Jack's entitlement is astounding. Jack can rent a car like everyone else and if her returns the rental car damaged then there will be financial repercussions. It might teach him personal responsibility.", "NTA. Jack is an entitled jerk. You have no obligation to lend him anything. The cold shoulder shows he values you for what he can get from you more than as a friend.\n\nReally, you should not be lending your car to anyone. It's not like you have a spare or two. You put a lot of money into it, and it's for your use. Let others get a rental rather than deprive you of your own property and mobility.", "NTA.  Hey, I checked with your insurance and it turns out you aren\u2019t covered for any other drivers.  Sorry man, you just can afford the risk.\n\nYou were kind to offer other solutions.

So his plan is just that it's okay for you to be without a car for the whole weekend?\n\nNope.", "NTA\n\nYou don't need an explanation.

Also, they'd probably have to put in three car seats, which can damage your upholstery. If he was at least a responsible driver, I might let it go if he agreed to pay for detailing afterwards, but that would likely be more than just renting a car. And what are you supposed to drive while he's gone if his car is in the shop?", "NTA\n\n>he needs the car for his family, argues that I should be more understanding given his situation\n\nFine, play it that way. Get a contract drawn up detailing what his responsibilities will be while your vehicle is in his possession and what he will be liable for if it is not returned in the exact same pristine condition it is now. If he pushes back on it as being unreasonable, point out that you need the car for your family and that he should be more understanding given YOUR situation. See if maybe that doesn't deflate him a bit.", "NTA First issue is your insurance probably wouldn\u2019t even cover him driving it. Second, what does he expect you to do without your car for an entire weekend? Do you have a fleet of cars and if so why didn\u2019t he ask to borrow the old one? Third, asking to borrow your car for an entire weekend is incredibly pushy. What are the chances this would just be the start of him constantly wanting to take your car.", "Tell him his obnoxious reaction to your refusal clinched your decision.\n\nNTA.", "Want to say NAH, but Jack\u2019s pettiness at being told \u2018No\u2019 is ultimately making me say NTA. However, the situation sucks for everyone, you, Jack, and your friend set. No one likes tension.\n\nQuestion: if you still had your old car, would you still think twice about lending it to Jack for the weekend? If the answer is yes, then this situation isn\u2019t about you prioritizing your cars newness over a friend\u2019s needs, it\u2019s about his poor borrowing etiquette and understanding that he should return items borrowed in roughly the same condition he picked them up in or pay damages. If the answer is no, you need to think about your priorities in life. \n\nBTW, i suspect that this AITA isn\u2019t really about the fact that the car is new, or even about the fact that Jack can\u2019t take care of other people\u2019s stuff, it about jack\u2019s entitlement issues. The fact that he needs *your* car specifically and not *a* car is what makes me think this.  And usually when people want something and then get sulky when told \u2018no\u2019 means there is an entitlement issue in the mix. \n\nEdit to add: It\u2019s not your responsibility to provide transportation for his family, it\u2019s his and his wife\u2019s responsibility to provide transportation for their family. The fact that he got upset at \u2018no\u2019 and wouldn\u2019t consider the other (reasonable) options you gave him makes me wonder if there is some immaturity in his part.", "NTA, good grief. I've heard of kids throwing up in a new, borrowed car and the smell never leaving it, even after professional cleaning paid for by the owner not the borrower.\n\nJack just wants to show off with a new car.\n\nStick to your guns. Your friends have your back. Any that don't, point Jack in their direction.", "No f'n way I'd let my friends even borrow my old 05 Toyota let alone a brand new car. Nta", "NTA. A past record of not respecting property not his own is enough reason to refuse to lend him your car, add in a reputation for bad driving and three young children and your decision should be set in stone.

If what he needs to do is so important then he can take you up on your offer to help him find a rental.", "No is a complete sentence. You don\u2019t need to justify.  Jack\u2019s other friends are welcome to step up.", "NTA even if Jack were the most responsible child-free person in the world, he's not entitled to use your car if you don't want to lend it out. It's your car, your insurance, and your choice.", "Jack is responsible for his family. You aren\u2019t. NTA. He can find a way to get his family around while not using you in the mean time.  He isn\u2019t your friend if he is acting this way. Friends don\u2019t treat friends the way he is treating you. If you are in the US. You can be held liable for any damage, injury or death caused by someone using your car.
