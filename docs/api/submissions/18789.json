Your own father attempting to peer pressure you into dating from the age of 14 is not normal, and your mother's failure to protect you from whatever the fuck is going on with your dad makes her implicit as well, so yes, they both deserve to be embarrassed in front of family. Maybe this will flag up to the rest of the family and someone can finally intervene in this mess. You're not 'single' at ten years old, you're a child.

He probably is aware it makes you uncomfortable but doesn\u2019t care and uses lags in conversation to goad you into a response. \n\nYou told him so many times to knock it off and he never listened. Sometimes it takes being really rude and loud back for people to understand you are serious. \n\nYou are NTA for trying to maintain boundaries. As a parent I\u2019m in tune with my kids and I\u2019m aware of their feelings and do not push uncomfortable subjects in front of others. That is a conversation for another time. \n\nYou say your dad thinks you are lesbian and he is pushing you into this idea of a \u201cboyfriend\u201d.  He is TAH here. He is the adult and should know when to be quiet. \n\nIf I were you I would take my parents aside and tell them that your romantic feelings aren\u2019t fodder for the family to pick apart and they hurt you and make you angry for bringing it up once again when it is a subject you don\u2019t want to talk about. You are 16? You have the right to privacy. I would apologize for the harshness of the words but not the intent-stop asking about a boyfriend. \n\nCan you talk to your mom? Does she have any influence over your father? He is pushing you away and making it hard to share anything. He needs to stop this. Maybe your mom can help back you up? \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are going through this. Remember that \u201cNo.\u201d is a complete sentence. Learn to say it without explaining.

Debatable. \n\nYes, your dad is the main culprit here, but your mom isn\u2019t blameless. You\u2019ve been single since 10, so you\u2019ve been dating BEFORE 10 years old? What?

Like maybe if you\u2019re talking about a couple of 6 year old kids holding hands and kissing each other during recess that\u2019s normal, but to me that\u2019s not what it sounds like.

It's always best to *try* and keep your cool, and probably wasn't cool to call your mom desperate over something your dad was doing, but you established a very clear boundary with your dad and he repeatedly violated it, showing zero respect for your boundaries or your comfort.

And he was way out of line to bring up the subject in front of other people after you've asked him not to, repeatedly. Clearly, he was trying to embarrass you into talking about your sex life. But! Your response was beyond rude and beyond disrespectful. You were so far out of line that a satellite image couldn't find it. There was no need for you to insult your Dad like that. \n\nShould you feel embarrassed? Yes, your father is far from innocent. Should you feel exasperated? Absolutely! You asked him repeatedly not to bring the subject up and he crossed your boundary. However, there are better ways to shut a conversation down. For example, staring at him blankly and asking him why he felt that was an appropriate topic of conversation at the dinner table is one. Reminding him that you've asked him several times not to bring the subject up and that you're not going to respond to his question during a dinner party would have been a better response. What you did was atrocious!", "Well, good luck in life...that question will be asked a lot from a lot of people. And just wait until kids will be a topic, or what you want to study or jobs or whatever else imaginable. I hope you won't answer the way you did there. Was your dad annoying? Yes. But you were downright cruel no questions about it. I'm going with ESH, except your mom. But you definitely more than your dad.", "What you ask of him was not unreasonable. What you did when he was just being an overbearing loving father was quite unreasonable and downright cruel. Most men don't look good that is a fact among humans. In our speices the females look better than men on average because we females attract a mate. But looks are not everything.\n\nOp when you calm down first ask your mom why did she choose your dad? About how they met? My dad was a decent looking guy but I know from my mom she choose my dad on character. Most girls chose him at first for his looks than didn't like his character when that is best part of him. If he wasn't decent looking, my mom still would have pick him. Find out why your mom pick him.\n\nThen please appologise. Write a list of things he has done for you or reasons why you might care about your dad. And you are young. You probably don't realize this but most guys at that age are too shy to ask girls out because well we can be mean. Guys have feelings too and at that age don't have the guts to ask the one they want out. Ask your girlfriends if there is any guys wanting to go out with you. I bet you be surprise by the anwser.

If it\u2019s not asking about a partner or if you are dating someone would you have the same reaction if your dad asked you at the table about school work?

Are you upset that he\u2019s trying to be involved in your life or is it just the boyfriend thing that makes you go nuclear?  Or are you reacting this way to any question he asks?", "EHS The fact that you also insult your mom while blowing up makes an AH.
