If someone walks over to you to say something super mean and then flounce, they're the asshole and you can chill.", "NTA I would rather people brought squishmallows to exams instead of fidget spinners and pens that they nervously click. At least your coping mechanism is silent and generally unobtrusive. I assume she didn't do too well considering she was so focused on anything but her own business", "NTA and not childish IMO.

You don't have to stop liking something because you turned a certain age. \n\nIf you stay true to your needs and interests and don't move on simply because someone tells you to start liking tv shows, fashion, cooking, relationships or whatever other thing they decide is \"adult enough\", then it just means you have discovered who you are and you are confident in yourself. Obviously try new things occasionally to grow in who you are, but unless you are actually hurting someone, never *change* who you are.\n\nThe happiest people I know are the ones that stay true to their genuine interests and likes, and that have friends that are perfectly ok each other having whatever interest they like (Sounds like your friend is already in that category).", "NTA.

They think those things are for little kids, and may even develop a disdain for them. But when those same people get older, they love those things again. And the natural confidence that just comes from being older and out of school tends to make people care a whole lot less what other people think, so they finally feel free to like and do whatever they want, even if it\u2019s considered childish. \n\nSo my verdict if you\u2019re \u201cchildish\u201d is: NTA \n\n-You\u2019re \u201cflaunting\u201d an expensive stuffed animal (and that\u2019s not going to get you anywhere in life) \n1) Squishmallows, unless they\u2019re rare collector\u2019s items, aren\u2019t expensive \n2) you weren\u2019t flaunting it\n3) seems weird that she would care at all about where you go in life \n\nSo my ruling if you\u2019re \u201cflaunting\u201d is also NTA. \n\nIn all ways, her opinion isn\u2019t worth a second more of your thoughts.

I'm confident that the whole point of being an adult - one who is going to be 48 soonish - is doing what makes me happy. Which includes collecting squishmallows.
