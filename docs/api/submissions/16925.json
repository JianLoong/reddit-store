The soft, squishable material of Squishmallows makes them a comforting presence, and some **adults find them soothing to hold or cuddle with**. Feb 4, 2023\"\n\nSo, NTA. Tell her that people older than her said she can kick rocks.", "There\u2019s no way you\u2019re an AH. Not in the slightest. I\u2019m in my 30s and have plenty of Squish! Do what makes you happy!!! That person is insecure and negative.", "NTA!\n\nAnd it's a perfectly valid coping strategy and  if she thinks you're too old for a comfort object, she would be horrified by me.\n\nI'm 54 & have a Tigger Beanie Baby that goes with me to the dentist and when I have to get blood drawn- he's very helpful. And the staff always think it's great.  (Their jobs are easier when patients aren't freaking out)\nMy husband got him for me more than 20 years ago .\n\nYou keep your squishy hamster and don't give that nosy, humorless, unpleasant girl another thought. \n\nI hope you aced the test....and, petty as it is, I hope she got a C out of sheer mercy on the teacher's part.", "NTA. If someone walks over to you to say something super mean and then flounce, they're the asshole and you can chill.", "NTA I would rather people brought squishmallows to exams instead of fidget spinners and pens that they nervously click. At least your coping mechanism is silent and generally unobtrusive. I assume she didn't do too well considering she was so focused on anything but her own business", "NTA and not childish IMO. I\u2019m a grown up and brought a stuffy with me when I needed to go to the hospital. The student who confronted you lives with parents who are always trying to \u201ctoughen\u201d them up. She was projecting what she\u2019s learned. You do you and they can do them.", "Nta, who cares if you bring a stuffed animal to school, lots of people have comfort objects. I think it's nice\n\nThe only childish thing was someone in your class being obviously jealous over a stuffed animal and then trying to make you feel bad for it.", "If more people were childish the world would be a better place.  NTA", "I personally think it\u2019s kind of childish however there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You suffer from anxiety and this is how you cope. You\u2019re not creating issues for anybody by doing this. Sounds like your classmate was very likely just jealous. NTA you do you kiddo.", "Eh, it may be a bit childish, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s wrong! I think it shows a sign of maturity that you have found a way to work around your anxiety when you need to. Like others said, you do you. It honestly sounds like she just wanted it and is jealous that you have it. Sometimes people are just mean for no reason. Sometimes people snap about something random because they are dealing with something completely different. Who knows? Either way, you\u2019re NTA here.", "NTA.\n\nBringing a stuffed animal may be \"childish\" or not, but that's not anyone's business but your own. The other girl was a nosy AH.\n\nThat said, you may want to address your anxiety with a therapist and think about other ways to handle stress when it may not be appropriate to have a stuffed animal, such as a stress ball or something else. Good luck!", ">I\u2019m starting to think that me bringing a stuffed animal is kinda childish\n\nChildish, yes. AH, no.", "NTA and absolutely not childish. If a plushie helps you out then great!", "NTA. It's not your fault that the other girl thinks your business is her business. I'm glad you had a friend there to stand up for you.", "I don't see how you would be the asshole.", "NTA.  You have found something that can help you deal with your anxiety.  Most people turn to far more self destructive coping mechanism so don't feel bad that you have found a healthy way to cope.  Don't even think about it.  You're doing great.", "NTA - bringing a stuffed animal to help support you during a stressful time is whatever you want it to be.  Don't let others harsh on your mellow.  This girl sounds like she just wants to say something mean just for the sake of saying something mean.  You do you, kid and best of luck on the exams.", "NTA", "Besides the 'state tests' being a colossal waste of time and resources, you are NTA for bringing the tools necessary for you to succeed with you.", "NTA - You do you. Your not hurting anyone and it helps you cope.\n\nAnd to address: \n\n>I\u2019m starting to think that me bringing a stuffed animal is kinda childish\n\nChildish is a relative term and completely made up by society. You don't have to stop liking something because you turned a certain age. \n\nIf you stay true to your needs and interests and don't move on simply because someone tells you to start liking tv shows, fashion, cooking, relationships or whatever other thing they decide is \"adult enough\", then it just means you have discovered who you are and you are confident in yourself. Obviously try new things occasionally to grow in who you are, but unless you are actually hurting someone, never *change* who you are.\n\nThe happiest people I know are the ones that stay true to their genuine interests and likes, and that have friends that are perfectly ok each other having whatever interest they like (Sounds like your friend is already in that category).", "NTA. You are using a HEALTHY COPING MECHANISM to help you with your anxiety. This girl was being totally ableist and a bully. You keep doing you. And good for you for finding a way to get through it!", "NTA.   \n\n\nChildish? Eh, a little\u2026 but if you need a comfort item, you need it. Somewhere along the way you can balance your need for a comfort item with the social rules of having said item. This can look like swapping out a squishmallow for a cute eraser that sits on your desk looking happily a t you, or to a small stress ball foam thingy that is the size of your hand instead of your head\u2026 slowly changing things to be less obvious.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

FYI, you said she made a remark like \"you shouldn't be flaunting expensive teddies\", sounds like she's a little jealous!\n\nI recommend picking some of the strings apart and putting some lavender beads inside and sewing it back up! Its a great calming essence.

There is nothing wrong with carrying a squishmallow to class to help you manage your anxiety.

It's not like getting older means we cope better with fear and stress. That stuffed animal could be keeping you from turning to substances and food to cope. My mom is in her 60s and sleeps with a stuffed animal, so do I and im in my 30s. \n\nShe's jelly. She wishes she could afford it.

I personally would buy her a squishmallow and leave it on her desk with a note \"I know you did not like the hamster one, but I hope this one brightens your day\" Leave it and walk away, maybe at the end of class. Maybe it will make her think about her actions and maybe it will actually bring her joy, especially if her parents refuse to buy her one or let her get one.

Some people aren't emotionally mature enough to realize that \"popular with children\" and \"childish\" are different concepts. You have a cute plush that's comforting to squeeze and it's a non-disruptive outlet for anxiety. This girl thinks she's being very grown up telling you off for having a toy, but realistically she's over-stepping and being inappropriate.
