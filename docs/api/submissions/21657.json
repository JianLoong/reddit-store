They are inexpensive and fantastic.  A lifesaver for me.  I'm annoyed at her for using her illness to try to take your hair away from you.", "NTA- for one thing it takes like anywhere  from 2 to seven heads of hair to make a wig.  Your head of hair is not enough. So take cutting your hair off the table.\n\nSo cut to the chase. You said that your mother insisted you have a pixie cut or worse growing up.  And she is really down right now from cancer and ue to her own beliefs from her own mother, is a sign of beauty.\n\nYour hair is not enough for wig, and I don't know if you have the resources or connections in place to even get it made into a wig.\n\nBut it would mean you're be bald again and not competition for her.

Thirdly, you're not at all required on any level to do this for your mother.", "NTA. Why does the hair have to come from you?", "Wigs in this day and age are easily accessed and exist in such a variety that you can have literally any hairstyle you want.\n\nYour mother believes hair is what makes you pretty.\n\nYour mother policed your hair in a way that consistently traumatized you and made you feel ugly throughout your entire childhood, to the point that you threatened to run away and still have issues about it.\n\nAll three of these facts existing at the same time leads me to believe that her request to have YOUR hair is just another attempt to control you. Sick people can still be awful. NTA. Maybe offer to take her wig shopping.", "NTA. \n\nBy forcing you to keep your hair that short despite your protests and requests for bodily autonomy, and by making it clear that she thought hair was what makes one pretty, she was emotionally abusing you. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her your hair. And I\u2019m shocked that so many people are suggesting you buy her a wig. You don\u2019t owe her that either. \n\nThe request is also incredibly impractical since it takes several heads of hair to make one wig, and since there\u2019s not some kind of global wig shortage.

It\u2019s not necessary at all. You can find her a good quality real human hair wig without cutting all your hair off.

It sounds like she has issues with control and wants to be able to control you again how she used to", "NTA.\n\nYour mom doesn\u2019t need your hair to have a wig; it sounds like she wants your hair because it will force you to make a sacrifice, and (in her mind) be less beautiful. She\u2019s jealous you have long hair and she wants to tear you down to feel better about herself.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, synthetic wigs are often actually better than natural wigs today; there\u2019s no direct benefit to her in having *your* hair in the wig. Heck, I\u2019m sure it even costs more because the wig would have to be custom made. \n\nYour sacrifice would not benefit her, except that she feels better seeing you feel worse. The fact that she denied you long hair all your life is just extra justification for a \u201cNo\u201d that would be justified regardless.", "NTA. She believes hair is important  but she made you keep yours as short as possible? Shes jealous of her own child, and doesn't want the competition.\nHonestly  don't engage with this. Don't cut your hair. Your self image really matters too. Plus she doesn't need YOUR hair!! Wigs are readily available if she wants one  and they don't have to be human hair to look good. \n\nAlso, I believe you need 3+ heads of hair to make one decent wig.

Her needing a wig has exactly ZERO to do with you needing to cut your hair. She's still trying to keep you from outshining her. Not saying she's conscious of doing it, but she's doing it.

My mom wasn't as bad as OP's mom (she *loved* my hair and would *never* let me cut it, all because *her* mom made her keep her hair short), so I don't have the insecurity aspect. But when your mother claims that kind of authority over you and controls you like that, your body starts to feel alienating. It feels like you're just renting the space, and it's not really yours. That's just the start of it. Then throw on OP's mom's indoctrination that hair = beauty, *all while forcing OP to keep her hair super short* -- her mother sounds irredeemable.", "First, NTA. Second, are you sure your mom has cancer and this isn't a weird way for her to control you? Third, if she does have cancer, she should have received resources where she could have gotten a wig from. It's been a while since I went through chemo and I wasn't interested, so I don't remember much.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry your mum is so controlling. I\u2019ve cut my hair short a few times in my life and always end up regretting it. I\u2019m all about long hair, makes me feel pretty and makes me feel myself. I\u2019m sad when I have short hair. Hair really effects us. \n\nYour mum is being ridiculous. There are a gazillion wig shops. Should imagine getting one made from your hair would cost more. \n\nNazis used to cut peoples hair as a form of humiliation and degradation. Hair is so important to us.", "She could get a wig off of Amazon, alibaba or the beauty supply store. Why does she need YOUR hair specifically? Does she know the process or the cost of putting your hair into wefts and building a wig? Does she plan on buying a closure or somehow getting someone to use your hair for it? People donate hair for wigs all the time of their own free will, why is she trying to guilt you into cutting yours?  Especially with what you shared, it seems like she just wants to feel prettier then you by cutting your hair. NTA. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA\n\nYou cannot make a wig from head of hair.

It would take several people's hair to do it. Which is why she should buy one.", "NTA, people think that making the wig is an easy process.  Go online and look what it takes.  First the go through the donation hair by hair and end up tossing a lot out.  It can take up to six people donating to make one single wig.  Then there is the cost, custom wigs are over $1,00 US.", "If your Mom believes hair makes you pretty, there was a very negative reason she was forcing you to keep your hair short, despite the fact it caused you emotional pain. You don't owe her anything.", "They aren't cheap no matter who provides the hair. So if cost is the obstacle, manipulating her child into providing hair really isn't going to make it that much cheaper \u2013 especially since she'd almost certainly need more hair than can be obtained from OP.", "Besides, one head of hair isn't enough to make a wig, it takes two or three. OP literally doesn't have enough to do what her mom is asking.", "She wants OP's hair. There's a LOT to unpack here and it's not just hair. NTA but your mom has serious issues.", "NTA.

I never know where I will learn random stuff.", "I was wondering about that. It's not like cut hair is just ready to be applied to another person's head. Surely the labor to actually make the wig is the most significant part of the cost - ?", "Yeah, it really seems like she just doesn't want OP to have long hair, and will use whatever she can to try to get her way."]}
