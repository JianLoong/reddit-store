Why does she need YOUR hair? Think on that\u2026. Jealousy seems like it is not an unrealistic answer.

I despised it. \n\nShe thought hair was important, but didn't let you *have* hair, and now she still wants to control your hair?? Big NTA for you. \n\nI'm so sorry, this must be very difficult for you to see someone so close to you being ill, but the petty in me would absolutely suggest that if she wants hair like yours, how about the hairstyle you had when she made you have a buzzcut. But because I'm a wimp, I'd probably just offer to take her wig shopping, which is frankly about the maximum she could possibly expect from you on the topic of hair.", "NTA.  There's no reason I can see that her wig must be made out of your hair.  I understand she feels insecure, but it's perfectly possible to buy very good wigs in whatever style she wants.  Hold your ground.", "NTA\n\nSounds like mom doesn't want you to outshine her (hence all those short dos while she had all this emphasis on HER hair).\n\nOffer to buy her a wig. It's all you can do. Or help her buy one. (Not made from your hair of course).", "Wigs are made from the hair of more than one person. So her idea isn\u2019t going to work.", "NTA\n\nWig shops exist. Your mum can buy a wig or get a wig made without you needing to cut your hair. \n\nLet me rephrase this. Your mum thinks having long hair is part of a woman's beauty. But she kept your hair short as a child. (Does this mean she wanted you not to be beautiful?) Now mum has lost her hair under tragic circumstances and wants you to sacrifice your beauty (based on ideas from her upbringing) for hers.\n\nNo hun. Don't cut your hair. \n\nYou grow your hair as long as your feet or give yourself a buzz cut and burn the hair in a bonfire if that's your jam (I don't recommend that because burning hair smells awful but you get my point). Your bodily/hair choices should not be dictated by your mum. She doesn't need your hair. You aren't denying her anything by exercising your bodily autonomy.", "NTA - Yeah, mum's can pull off the \"I'm not mad I'm just disappointed\" to devastating effect when they want to. Maybe you can offer to help her pick out a wig that she likes?", "NTA you can't make a wig from one person cutting their hair 1 time. It takes at minimum 3 heads of hair to make one wig. Are you a wig maker? Does she expect you to make her a wig from your own hair? Cuz that shit cost hundreds of dollars. Take her with you to a wig maker and the wig maker can explain all this to her. It's not really possible what she is asking of you.", "Naw, not at all.  If she remains insistent, tell her to do her research:  Human hair makes the worst wig.", "NTA. I'm sorry for what your mother is going through but she can purchase a wig. You don't need to sacrifice your own hair for her.", "NTA \n\nHair is not made from a single person hair, but multiple. It also tales weeks to months to create a decent one. The best thing is for her to buy a wig. Especially since as a child she controlled your hair and is still trying to do so.", "Don\u2019t let her get to you. You don\u2019t owe her your hair. Take her wig shopping.", "NTa. My mother did this to me when i was a child, cut my long hair into a pixie. I hated it and her until it grew out years later. Tell your Mom you'll buy her a human hair wig.", "Cancer survivor here. \n\nDO NOT CUT YOUR HAIR. \n\nThere are a gazillion wigs she can choose from in the stores.", "What the actual heck. She wants to wear your hair? That's creepy.

Keep your hair, my darling.  She doesn't need it, and don't let her take it from  you.  \n\n\nShe can buy a wig.  Or her insurance can cover one.

They are inexpensive and fantastic.  A lifesaver for me.

Your head of hair is not enough. So take cutting your hair off the table.\n\nSo cut to the chase. You said that your mother insisted you have a pixie cut or worse growing up.  And she is really down right now from cancer and ue to her own beliefs from her own mother, is a sign of beauty.\n\nYour hair is not enough for wig, and I don't know if you have the resources or connections in place to even get it made into a wig.\n\nBut it would mean you're be bald again and not competition for her. I don't think she really wants your hair for a wig, I think she just wants you bald.\n\nThis is coming from someone who had a narcissistic parent who controlled my own hair against my will, So take that with a grain of salt.", "NTA and your hair cannot actually be made into a wig for her without hair from many more people and a lot of money, plus it takes a long time.", "THOUSANDS of dollars."]}
