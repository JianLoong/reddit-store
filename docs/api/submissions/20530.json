I (34F) have a 14 year old daughter. She has a fairly small but incredibly close group of friends, one of which has been here since school let out for summer break (almost exactly a month ago). They spend their days sleeping and their nights swimming and watching movies and giggling like teenager girls tend to do. About a week ago, I started making the friend help my daughter with her usual chores. \n\nAnd for clarity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll explain exactly what I mean by \u201cchores\u201d. Washing her own laundry (I handle mine and my husband\u2019s as well as all the \u201chouse laundry\u201d - towels, blankets, bed linens), loading her dirty dishes into the dishwater (again, I handle mine and my husband\u2019s as well as the \u201chouse dishes\u201d), helping clean up my daughters room (usually just means putting away/cleaning up music equipment, art supplies, and about a million half-empty water bottles and snack wrappers that need to go in the bin), help clean the pool before they go swimming (by this I mean using the net to clean away leaves and bugs but I do the major cleaning - vacuuming, filter changes, pump cleaning, level checks) putting up pool floaties after swimming, and once or twice a week, helping to cook dinner (I handle all other meals/snacks and all the shopping). Considering she\u2019s been here for weeks, I thought this was fair\u2026but the girl\u2019s mom does NOT think it\u2019s fair, and here\u2019s the part where I get called an asshole.\n\nThe girls helped me make manicotti for dinner. The food was delicious and they were both (rightly) proud of themselves for how well it turned out. The friend took a picture and shared it to Snapchat, where her mom saw it. I\u2019m not entirely certain what was said in the conversation between the friend and her mom, but I do know they spoke just before I got an irate phone call from her mom. She said I don\u2019t have a real job (and to be fair, I don\u2019t have an income-earning job, I\u2019m an unemployed SAHM by choice) and that it wasn\u2019t her daughter\u2019s responsibility to feed me and keep my house in order. At first, I had assumed maybe the friend told her mom I was having her \u201cdo chores\u201d but didn\u2019t explain what the chores actually were. I thought her mom might have just jumped to conclusions and thought I\u2019m having her kid clean my house, mow the lawn, and cook us dinner every night. But no, after explaining what exactly it is I was making her daughter do, she was still very angry. She called me a lazy AH before hanging up on me and now I\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s right. Her daughter is a guest in our home, even if it\u2019s a bit of an extended stay instead of her usual 3-4 days before going back home. Should I just leave it at her picking up her dishes/trash and do the rest myself? Is the laundry, pool, and dinner going too far?

Those chores sound reasonable for even a short term guest. I'm also wondering if the mom sent you any money to pay for her daughter's food and laundry loads..guessing not.

This is regardless of the duration of their stay. \n\nCooking together sounds like a fun activity the girls did, especially if she proudly posted on snapchat.\n\nThe girls\u2019 mother is probably annoyed that she is having so much fun at your place.

Then last night, they asked me to make manicotti and I told them I\u2019d only make it if they helped even though Monday is usually when my daughter helps with the meal. They agreed and we spent nearly two hours destroying my kitchen. But had she told me she didn\u2019t want to cook, I probably wouldn\u2019t have made her. It would feel\u2026sexist as hell to make a teenage girl cook dinner and it\u2019s not my job to make sure she can cook for herself when she reaches adulthood. I make my daughter do it (and made my son do it as well) because it is my responsibility to teach them these things.

The tasks that you mentioned, like doing her own laundry or loading her dirty dishes into the dishwasher are not really chores, they are more of self-reliance tasks, imo. Having stayed at your place for a month, the least that the friend can do is be grateful by picking up after herself and ensuring that she's not a burden to you or your family. \n\nThe friend is already at an age where she should have understood this and volunteered for these tasks right from the beginning. If you had to explicitly ask her to do this, then it sounds like she's being spoiled at her own home.

Not because I'm lazy but because it's how they learn to look after themselves.", "NTA, I wouldn't even say she's doing chores. She's been asked to clean up after herself, and to get the leaves out of the pool if she wants to use it. And the cooking thing turned out well so no harm no foul there.\n\nI'm actually shocked her mother got angry at you. How dare she. You've been looking after and feeding her daughter for the past month, she should be grateful that you were okay to do this- regardless of whether you're a SAHM mum or not.", "NTA, most of the tasks you mentioned should be done by any household member without even being considered as \"chores\" that need to be established in order to be completed.

My parents loved providing a safe environment for everyone especially since some of my friends had less than stellar home lives. \n\nAll of us were expected to do the basic sorts of chores you've outlined here, whether it was a one day party and we had to put our dishes in the dishwasher and pick up the trash, or an extended stay with additional expectations like helping with meals. One of my friends got into the habit of taking out the trash every time he came over and my mom adored him. \n\nI'm in my 30s now and all of my friends from that time period still speak fondly about my parents.

And by help out I mean tidy up what ever mess they've made, help with making dinner and put what ever plates, glasses, cutlery as close as possible to the sink. However, in your situation you have a kid staying for a month and after your phone call with her mother I think I can see why. It is very telling that although her mom was \"horrified\" she still didn't rush over to pick her daughter up and take her away. \nThis is your house and your rules which are so incredibly normal, if your daughter's friend didn't like it, she'd be gone back home.", "Nothing in your post is more important than: Please stop buying single use plastic bottles. Putting things in the recycling bin doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all good. The majority of items you put in the recycling bin will never be recycled and will go straight to the landfill, that\u2019s just facts. \n\nDoes the public works department in your area give tours of their waste management facilities, many do, that would be a good day trip activity for them lol. I get it, reusable water bottles get a bad taste. But they\u2019re in your house, make them use glasses. If your water is weird get a Big Berkey. No more plastic. Things do not get recycled. It\u2019s wishful thinking. \n\nAnyways besides that NTA. It sounds like there\u2019s stuff going on with the mom and daughter (read your comment about divorce) that has nothing to do with chores. I would either limit the amount of time she stays there, or keep having her do chores, which seems like no big deal. This sounds like the mom is feeling weird and flipping out for no reason. I think it\u2019s cool and fun you let your daughters friends stay with her, good for you. Get rid of the plastic water bottles though omg", "When I was your daughter's age, I often went over to my best friend's house for unexpectedly long stays (a one night sleepover might turn into a weekend, or even longer). That usually meant I was roped into whatever plans the family had while I was there, and her mom would ask me to out however I could - washing dishes, cooking, typical teenage chore stuff. And I'll be honest, I LOVED it. I loved that when I was at my friend's home, her parents treated me like I was a third daughter, with the same responsibilities and expectations as my friend. It made me feel like I was a part of the family rather than a guest, and it soothed the anxiety I had that I was taking advantage of their generosity when I stayed for a long time (especially since for various reasons my friend and I rarely hung out at my own home). \n\nNTA, and not only do I think it's appropriate that you ask your daughter's friend to help her with her chores, she might even thank you for it 10 years down the line.", "Back when I was in high School my best friend and I wound alternate whose home we stayed at during the summer. We both were expected to help the other with chores and neither of us really saw this as wrong or strange. \n\nSo, to me, You're NTA.", "NTA. Is she just supposed to sit and stare while your daughter clears the mess they both made? Part of being a good guest is not adding to the workload of your host.", "Exactly. What OP is doing is perfect. It helps ensure that this kid has got valuable life skills, and it helps them to feel like they really belong in your home. It can be easy to feel like you\u2019ve overstayed your welcome after such a long time, and it can be exhausting to tiptoe around.  If she\u2019s a regular fixture at the house, and if you are feeding her on the regular as if she\u2019s a part of your family, she can absolutely contribute.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if you asked this woman for money for all the food you\u2019re giving her child while she\u2019s basically living in your home. She sends her kid off to someone\u2019s house and they come back fed, bathed, and fully laundered, and she berates you instead of thanking you?

But she eats ranch on everything and I hate the smell of it. I asked her to give them a rinse and stick them in the wash because I was tired of dry heaving into the sink.", "Yes!

They need to know how to manage their own household because you can\u2019t rely on partners/roommates knowing how (or them being willing to teach you if they do know).

But it\u2019s not a requirement and just something I have her help with when she\u2019s lazing about and I\u2019m cleaning and dancing around to Backstreet Boys like it\u2019s 1999.", "Suspect guilt is part of the response. OP is effectively parenting her child. Suspect mother could wrap her mind round her child staying away because it is fun but not settling into another family. She's just had a divorce, her daughter is staying away, suspect not in perfectly good mind. Still an AH but maybe A AH needing help. Just glad the daughter has a safe supportive place.", "She did help with cleaning up the room. Mostly just the trash and the paints and stuff. My husband\u2019s been trying to teach her how to play the drums and guitar last weekend and this one, so helping put that stuff away only recently became necessary. She would put her dishes on the counter or in the sink, but not rinse them or anything. She wasn\u2019t helping with the pool (usually applying sunscreen despite the fact that its almost always night/close to dark when they swim\u2026\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) but the floaties thing is a pool rule that everyone has to follow if they want to swim. If you get it out of the shop, then you put it back when you\u2019re done. \nShe also wasn\u2019t washing her laundry, just having someone bring her more clothes every few days until she ran out.", "To be fair, this is less of a chore and more of a pool rule that applies to anyone, staying the night or not. If you take it out of the shop, you put it back when you\u2019re done or you don\u2019t get to swim anymore. But it was something her mom mentioned in the phone call, so I thought it needed to be included in the post.", "Increasing her responsibility a bit now during the summer will help when she gets a summer job. I am sure you won't overburden her to the point she doesn't have time to have fun. It's good practice for learning to balance all the demands on her time.", "All of this sounds reasonable and appropriate. \n\nIt's fair that she cleans up after herself, and after a month she isn't a guest anymore so she ought to contribute to the household too. And she wanted to learn to make that dish so she chose meal prep as a way to contribute.\n\nSide note - my highschool bf's mom was similar to you and it was great. She also let my bf and I destroy the kitchen to cook dinner for everyone. It made sense since I spent a lot of time there and ate there (my home life wasn't ideal, I think she wanted me to have a safe space so she never sent me away). Helping him cook for their family was something I could do to feel less like a burden since I was around so often. And when we wanted to try something new, she'd join us to help us out. I really appreciated her, she handled that situation with grace and kindness - and I think you're doing the same.", "Scooping trash out of the pool before they use it is just a common sense thing, not a chore even! Most people don't even have access to a private pool.", "Also, an invoice for the summer elective life skills educational immersion program.\n\nIf a teenager returns home ready and able to cook and clean in reasonable amounts and with better likelihood to cope well in non-family accommodation in the future... there are literally paid programs for this sort of thingb", "I have to ask: is this a thing? Giving someone money when your kids go to stay with them? So many people are bringing it up, but I\u2019ve never heard of doing this. As a kid, I was always stuck at home watching my younger brother and, as I\u2019m sure you can tell, my kids are usually with me (well, my son is nearly 20 and living on his own now, but still), so it\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve had to consider with them. It never even crossed my mind until this post.\n\nETA: for anyone doing the math on the son bit, no, I didn\u2019t have a kid at 14. We did adopt him when he was 14 though", "That\u2019s great that she gave you a safe space. Everyone needs to feel like they have home, even if it\u2019s not their actual home. That\u2019s exactly what we want to do for our kids\u2019 friends. I want them to know they have us if they need us. And that\u2019s especially true with my daughter\u2019s friends. We\u2019ve known these girls since they were 4, and we\u2019ve come to love them. My son is a little different because was much older when he moved in with us, but a couple of his friends still text and stop by when they are in town despite the fact that my son moved out a year and a half ago.", "I wouldn't let this girl's Mom ruin the dynamic you guys have going. It sounds like this girl is more than happy to pull her weight, and honestly, at 14 living with your friend for that long. Its pretty obvious that she doesn't enjoy her own home.", "Do not let my husband see this comment\ud83e\udee3 He can be as petty as it gets and would absolutely do this", "Not if it's for a weekend. I wouldn't even ask for money if my kids friends came to stay a week. But a month? I find it really scummy, that she didn't offer you any money for that amount of extra meals. And to have the audacity to be mad at you for making your daughters friend do a minimal amount of chores in return... She seems really entitled. Does she think she deserves free childcare and food for her daughter because you are a SAHM to your child?", "NO, it is not a thing, at least where I am. \n\nBut then again, people at the US are comfortable collecting rent from the 18YO, so who knows", "the only times i've ever heard of a kid staying a week at a time at their friend's house, the kid has a bad home life. i don't know a lot of involved parents who are cool with their kid being out yonder these days. i had friends who were over often but my parents allowed it because their parents kinda sucked, and it still wasn't anywhere near a month at a go. at that point my folks would likely have been looking at legal custody, tbh, just for the sake of convenience; you're taking on a lot of liability having other people's children in your home and car so often. so yeah, given that amount of time, compensation or *something* would be kinda expected.\n\nediting to add i grew up in a big town/small city and am not a part of any kind of close religious community, so perhaps that's more normal in those spaces? but my friends who were over \"a lot\" would like... stay at my place after school until their parents got off shifts at 8 or 9, five days a week. not staying over weeks at a time. and their folks wouldn't have given a shit if my mom made them mop the floors like cinderella, which she did not do lol.", "My parents had the same type of house as you, although there were usually two or three or four kids spending the night, and sometimes even more because I have 4 siblings. \n\nWe had a pool and lived on the lake and my parents were chill and so it was the house everyone hung out at.\n\nShe would often ask the parents to pack lunches \nand food for their kids if they were coming over for a few days because my parents had five kids and not a whole lot of money and my parents were very frugal so we could afford a better house. \n\nTheir parents would often give them pizza money or something for the whole family which was nice because we hardly ever ate out or ordered from restaurants so it was a treat. \n\nShe would ask our friends parents to pay for any food we ate outside of the home too or for any activities. It was fair and caused no issues", "This is why my husband agreed to give me some time to figure out what guidelines I\u2019m comfortable with. I do think the length of her stay is a little excessive, but I also want all of her friends to feel safe, comfortable, and welcome at our home. I don\u2019t want her to feel like we\u2019re tired of her or don\u2019t want her around. I also don\u2019t want her to think it\u2019s reactionary to her mother\u2019s phone call and feel like it\u2019s a punishment.", "I had a friend who would stay all weekend at my house every weekend. He was basically another brother to me, would even walk in to my house and say hi dad to my dad and I would say the same to his mum, he would go buy himself food every day on the way to my house despite being told every Friday, we have food, you don\u2019t need to get food. However if he tried to stay a month, my dad would have been totally okay with it but he would have been given chores to do, and his mum may have been asked for a little help with food, not that we would have had to ask. Seems like daughters friends mum is enjoying the extra money she is saving\u2026", "Living with some wild roaming teens: you better have a talk with your girl about 'the birds and the bees' and how to avoid being pressured into things around her 'friends'.  We're essentially a summerhouse opened up to relatives and their friends (I don't pay rent so I can't stop this at all) and we frequently host otherwise unsupervised teenagers all summer. Theyre fucking assholes, and have disrespected the very few boundaries in place (Do not go in our bedroom- I found our bed messed up a Camera Glasses in our sheets. Do not eat food *you* didn't buy for yourself-my work lunches disappear.). Because one of them had an addiction and unhelpful biblethumper parents/grandparents, we got the absolute pleasure of being the responsible party to call the ambulance during an . . . .episode. \n\nCut this off now.", "My mom was the mom that let my friends come and stay when their homes weren't safe. Now we're all in our 40's, and those kids grew up and had kids, and they remember my mom and talk about what might have happened if they hadn't had a safe and loving place to go. You're doing something Good; this is direct action that makes a difference."]}
