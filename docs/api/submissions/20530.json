I (34F) have a 14 year old daughter. She has a fairly small but incredibly close group of friends, one of which has been here since school let out for summer break (almost exactly a month ago). They spend their days sleeping and their nights swimming and watching movies and giggling like teenager girls tend to do. About a week ago, I started making the friend help my daughter with her usual chores. \n\nAnd for clarity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll explain exactly what I mean by \u201cchores\u201d. Washing her own laundry (I handle mine and my husband\u2019s as well as all the \u201chouse laundry\u201d - towels, blankets, bed linens), loading her dirty dishes into the dishwater (again, I handle mine and my husband\u2019s as well as the \u201chouse dishes\u201d), helping clean up my daughters room (usually just means putting away/cleaning up music equipment, art supplies, and about a million half-empty water bottles and snack wrappers that need to go in the bin), help clean the pool before they go swimming (by this I mean using the net to clean away leaves and bugs but I do the major cleaning - vacuuming, filter changes, pump cleaning, level checks) putting up pool floaties after swimming, and once or twice a week, helping to cook dinner (I handle all other meals/snacks and all the shopping). Considering she\u2019s been here for weeks, I thought this was fair\u2026but the girl\u2019s mom does NOT think it\u2019s fair, and here\u2019s the part where I get called an asshole.\n\nThe girls helped me make manicotti for dinner. The food was delicious and they were both (rightly) proud of themselves for how well it turned out. The friend took a picture and shared it to Snapchat, where her mom saw it. I\u2019m not entirely certain what was said in the conversation between the friend and her mom, but I do know they spoke just before I got an irate phone call from her mom. She said I don\u2019t have a real job (and to be fair, I don\u2019t have an income-earning job, I\u2019m an unemployed SAHM by choice) and that it wasn\u2019t her daughter\u2019s responsibility to feed me and keep my house in order. At first, I had assumed maybe the friend told her mom I was having her \u201cdo chores\u201d but didn\u2019t explain what the chores actually were. I thought her mom might have just jumped to conclusions and thought I\u2019m having her kid clean my house, mow the lawn, and cook us dinner every night. But no, after explaining what exactly it is I was making her daughter do, she was still very angry. She called me a lazy AH before hanging up on me and now I\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s right. Her daughter is a guest in our home, even if it\u2019s a bit of an extended stay instead of her usual 3-4 days before going back home. Should I just leave it at her picking up her dishes/trash and do the rest myself? Is the laundry, pool, and dinner going too far?

After a few weeks, you're not a guest, you're a temporary resident and it's only fair you help out. The fact that OP is a SAHM has nothing to do with it. Other mum is very confrontational.", "INFO: is the friend's parents paying you for utilities/food for letting her stay over for a month?\n\nIf not, then it's your house, your rules.

Also, it's not like the friend is the only one doing chores while your own daughter lazes around.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter's workload sounds really light to begin with, so I don't think the friend is actually doing that much. Cleaning up after yourself, loading your dishes in the washer? That's what i think is expected from a houseguest. \n\nThe friend's mother should be thankful that you are keeping up some sort of structure during summer.", "Even your daughter could do more. Washing the dishes or cooking for everyone a few times a week in the summer is fine. As for the guest, you aren't running a hotel. At the point she stays several weeks, she is not a guest. She should help. Her own mom is essentially getting her child fed etc. If she doesn't like it, let her child go home NTA.", "NTA, her mom is enjoying her free kid time but her ego gets hurt when see her daughter trying to help where she is staying lately. Therefore her mom is TA. \nShe should stay with the kids in her house for a change and she will see how messy can get quickly maybe she would see she was wrong", "Nta these are things she should be doing anyway. I wouldn't call them chores I'd call them normal expectations in cleaning up after yourself.", "NTA I would expect guests to tidy up after themselves  and bin their rubbish. It's lovely that you welcome her and it is telling that she hasn't wanted to go home in a month... maybe the mom is angry because the kid doesn't do this at home.", "NTA. Asking her to do her own laundry and put her dishes in the dishwasher isn\u2019t taxing. I think it\u2019s more than fair to get her to help out if she\u2019s staying for an extended time. The mother sounds like an entitled AH", "Info: is there some money given for the extra food ? And general day care?\n\nI assume that OP does not get money. But in case she does it is below.\n\nIt is more about a participation in general life there... And taking care of her own stuff like the teen she is. \n\nThe friend's mom transforms a cooking activity, cleaning her own mess and discovering how to take care of a private pool into real labour... Although she gets free \"teen care\" by a pool, and her daughter is enjoying free snacks and food.\n\nHer daughter is a guest, not a princess. \n\nIf there is money involved, well... in a teen camp, teens have to participate. That helps them grow up a bit to reaching slowly a form of autonomy toward adulthood. \n\nThe angry mother is entitled, belittles OP an sahm... OP would cut the meat if she needed that bc of her age and she would be watching and control the both of them in the pool. They would not be able to enjoy snacks in the room but they would probably help put the toys back in their box once they have finished. Because this is what you make kids do to help them grow.\n\nMaybe she would prefer OP treats her kid like the toddler she thinks she is. \n\nA guest, whether a toddler or a teen needs to get treated their age anyway and the longer you stay as a guest, the real thing is to participate at the level you can. NTA, but the other mom is a massive one.", "Oh ya your the lazy asshole when she's the one who pawned off her kid for a month.  Nope, she's the lazy asshole and the shit mother.

That\u2019s not normal teen behavior and I\u2019d look into if something is happening in her family to drive her away for that long.", "NTA\n\nWhen someone is an invited visitor, the onus is on the host to look after them.\n\nWhen someone is staying longer term, then it is fair to ask them to help cover their own upkeep. Asking them to do general maintenance like mowing the lawn or washing the cars would be inappropriate, but helping with their own laundry (and that would definitely be a big turning point to me if someone was staying with you long enough to be needing laundry done, that is a resident, not a visitor) and doing the dishes they have dirtied is completely fair.\n\nSomething also makes me think the same mother that is complaining about their kids being expected to help do the washing up isn't giving you anything to cover feeding and washing their child...", "My very anxious wife wants to know if you recycle the water bottles. . .", "NTA. Those chores sound reasonable for even a short term guest. I'm also wondering if the mom sent you any money to pay for her daughter's food and laundry loads..guessing not. You're fully within your right to state \"house rules\" that should be obeyed, or guests can go home.", "NTA.\n\nThis is how it was for me everytime I visited friends or cousins as a kid. After two weeks I wasn\u2019t a guest anymore. And the chores aren\u2019t outrageous. \n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong ma\u2019am.\n\nHave a nice day :) !", "NTA\n\nStay at home mother or not, most of the tasks that you have described fall under the realm of \u201cpicking up after yourself\u201d. Everyone should do this regardless of whether they are at their own home or someone else\u2019s. This is regardless of the duration of their stay. \n\nCooking together sounds like a fun activity the girls did, especially if she proudly posted on snapchat.\n\nThe girls\u2019 mother is probably annoyed that she is having so much fun at your place. And what kind of a lazy ass cold mother lets her daughter stay at someone\u2019s place for such a long time? I can understand staying at grandparents or a close relative\u2019s home. But, absolutely strange for a friends place. \n\nYou are doing a fabulous job, OP! I hope to raise my kids like you!", "The answer basically boils down to she\u2019s been here for so long because she wants to (and my daughter hasn\u2019t wanted her to leave). The entire friend group is fairly well behaved, so we don\u2019t mind having them around. Its not unusual for us to have at least one of her friends with us, but they usually go home after a few days. They\u2019ve never stayed for such a long period of time like this.", "No, they aren\u2019t. We\u2019ve gone on a couple of day trips just to get out of the house for a few hours and they\u2019ve brought her spending money for those, though.", "Send her daughter home and have the ungrateful mother take your kid for the rest of the summer. Tell her after your kid has been there a month, you are okay with your kid helping the whining mom\u2019s kid with her chores.", "This is something my husband and I have been discussing actually, more chores for my daughter. With what she has now, it\u2019s good for the school year because she does a lot of extracurricular sports, but she has nothing in the summer. We\u2019re torn between giving her more responsibility and letting her enjoy her last couple of years of being a kid before she turns 16 and is old enough to get a summer job.", "They haven\u2019t given us any money to cover any sort of living expenses (they have given her spending money for short day trips). \n\nI\u2019ll also say, I didn\u2019t ask her to help with dinner (though I was the one to ask about putting the dishes in the wash, help with the pool, and to do her own laundry - after three weeks, nearly her entire wardrobe was here and dirty and I don\u2019t wash my own kids\u2019 clothes, I\u2019m not about to wash hers) but when my daughter picked the meal on her night to cook last week, she picked her friend\u2019s favorite and the friend asked to help. Then last night, they asked me to make manicotti and I told them I\u2019d only make it if they helped even though Monday is usually when my daughter helps with the meal. They agreed and we spent nearly two hours destroying my kitchen. But had she told me she didn\u2019t want to cook, I probably wouldn\u2019t have made her. It would feel\u2026sexist as hell to make a teenage girl cook dinner and it\u2019s not my job to make sure she can cook for herself when she reaches adulthood. I make my daughter do it (and made my son do it as well) because it is my responsibility to teach them these things. Plus it\u2019s a way to make sure my husband and I have a little quality time with the kids, especially during the school year when it\u2019s busy and we have a million things going on.", "OP is also paying for all of this girls food its only fair to have her pitch in hell my friends mon always put us to work on those summer breaks being there a week at a time chores never hurt nobody especially a 14 yr old", "Girls been living there so long she's no longer to be considered a guest so can do some housework", ">You're not treating her like a guest, and that's solely because of her age.\n\nI think it's because she has moved from a short term guest to a long term one. Anyone who was living with me for a month wouldn't be just a guest. At some point they become part of the furniture and have to pick up after themselves.", "Idt age is a factor. If someone is at my house for several weeks, I expect them to pitch in.", "A guest who has been staying somewhere else for weeks. It's only fair that she picks up after herself and treats the home she is staying in with some respect and to give back to the family that are hosting her who are already taking on extra tasks and extra costs to take care of her.\n\nI'm not saying that OP or the guest are AH's. But the girl's mother is for assuming she can just drop her child off somewhere else and assume that her kid is not going to be responsible for helping out whilst living at someone's home for weeks.\n\nNTA", "If you have a daughter and her friend staying long, I guess you see no problem your daughter cleaning her friend's mess in the bedroom. Or clean the pool while her friend is watching... Double standards for a long period of time, what a dream holiday!\n\nI would say that if you need your laundry done and you get all this for free (food/accomodation), it is not disrespectful to participate and ease the burden of your presence. Here if that is too hard, guest can still enjoy pool access daily... and that probably ease the basic tasks she has to handle here.\n\nThe other mom belittles OP bc she is sahm and that makes her a huge AH. I am quite sure she gets free child care here so she can keep her hard earned money for her own benefit.", "NTA, but i think you should set some boundaries with your daughter about friends staying at your house so much for longer periods of time", "Time to start talking to the mom about food money. An extra mouth to feed for a whole month is not exactly cheap. Maybe she'll start to appreciate what you are doing for her more then.", "Yeah, my husband agrees. He wants a one week max to avoid the laundry issue that started this whole thing. He agreed to give me some time to think about what I\u2019m comfortable with and go from there.", "INFO: do your daughter and her friends only spend this much time at your house only or do they hang out at other girl's houses as well?", "It\u2019s largely just our house. One of her friends\u2019 grandparents have a lake house not too far from here, and they all go there for one weekend a month during the months with appropriate weather. Their birthdays are pretty spread out, so they all usually do weekend sleepovers for those at their own homes throughout the year. But outside of that, they usually want to come here."]}
