I (34F) have a 14 year old daughter. She has a fairly small but incredibly close group of friends, one of which has been here since school let out for summer break (almost exactly a month ago). They spend their days sleeping and their nights swimming and watching movies and giggling like teenager girls tend to do. About a week ago, I started making the friend help my daughter with her usual chores. \n\nAnd for clarity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll explain exactly what I mean by \u201cchores\u201d. Washing her own laundry (I handle mine and my husband\u2019s as well as all the \u201chouse laundry\u201d - towels, blankets, bed linens), loading her dirty dishes into the dishwater (again, I handle mine and my husband\u2019s as well as the \u201chouse dishes\u201d), helping clean up my daughters room (usually just means putting away/cleaning up music equipment, art supplies, and about a million half-empty water bottles and snack wrappers that need to go in the bin), help clean the pool before they go swimming (by this I mean using the net to clean away leaves and bugs but I do the major cleaning - vacuuming, filter changes, pump cleaning, level checks) putting up pool floaties after swimming, and once or twice a week, helping to cook dinner (I handle all other meals/snacks and all the shopping). Considering she\u2019s been here for weeks, I thought this was fair\u2026but the girl\u2019s mom does NOT think it\u2019s fair, and here\u2019s the part where I get called an asshole.\n\nThe girls helped me make manicotti for dinner. The food was delicious and they were both (rightly) proud of themselves for how well it turned out. The friend took a picture and shared it to Snapchat, where her mom saw it. I\u2019m not entirely certain what was said in the conversation between the friend and her mom, but I do know they spoke just before I got an irate phone call from her mom. She said I don\u2019t have a real job (and to be fair, I don\u2019t have an income-earning job, I\u2019m an unemployed SAHM by choice) and that it wasn\u2019t her daughter\u2019s responsibility to feed me and keep my house in order. At first, I had assumed maybe the friend told her mom I was having her \u201cdo chores\u201d but didn\u2019t explain what the chores actually were. I thought her mom might have just jumped to conclusions and thought I\u2019m having her kid clean my house, mow the lawn, and cook us dinner every night. But no, after explaining what exactly it is I was making her daughter do, she was still very angry. She called me a lazy AH before hanging up on me and now I\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s right. Her daughter is a guest in our home, even if it\u2019s a bit of an extended stay instead of her usual 3-4 days before going back home. Should I just leave it at her picking up her dishes/trash and do the rest myself? Is the laundry, pool, and dinner going too far?

This is regardless of the duration of their stay. \n\nCooking together sounds like a fun activity the girls did, especially if she proudly posted on snapchat.\n\nThe girls\u2019 mother is probably annoyed that she is having so much fun at your place.

It would feel\u2026sexist as hell to make a teenage girl cook dinner and it\u2019s not my job to make sure she can cook for herself when she reaches adulthood. I make my daughter do it (and made my son do it as well) because it is my responsibility to teach them these things.

The tasks that you mentioned, like doing her own laundry or loading her dirty dishes into the dishwasher are not really chores, they are more of self-reliance tasks, imo.

And the cooking thing turned out well so no harm no foul there.\n\nI'm actually shocked her mother got angry at you. How dare she. You've been looking after and feeding her daughter for the past month, she should be grateful that you were okay to do this- regardless of whether you're a SAHM mum or not.", "NTA, most of the tasks you mentioned should be done by any household member without even being considered as \"chores\" that need to be established in order to be completed.

My parents loved providing a safe environment for everyone especially since some of my friends had less than stellar home lives. \n\nAll of us were expected to do the basic sorts of chores you've outlined here, whether it was a one day party and we had to put our dishes in the dishwasher and pick up the trash, or an extended stay with additional expectations like helping with meals. One of my friends got into the habit of taking out the trash every time he came over and my mom adored him. \n\nI'm in my 30s now and all of my friends from that time period still speak fondly about my parents. My parents also love to tell stories of how fun those years were. I think you're doing just fine and setting your daughter and her friends up for success.", "NTA. The friend's mom is the AH. I don't care how nice my friend's family was- there's no way I would impose on them by leaving my daughter at their house for a month without some kind of compensation- work or money.", "NTA\n\nI don't know where to begin what you're doing is so normal... whenever we've kids staying whether it's for a few hours or overnights there is always the expectation that they help out. And by help out I mean tidy up what ever mess they've made, help with making dinner and put what ever plates, glasses, cutlery as close as possible to the sink. However, in your situation you have a kid staying for a month and after your phone call with her mother I think I can see why. It is very telling that although her mom was \"horrified\" she still didn't rush over to pick her daughter up and take her away. \nThis is your house and your rules which are so incredibly normal, if your daughter's friend didn't like it, she'd be gone back home.", "Nothing in your post is more important than: Please stop buying single use plastic bottles. Putting things in the recycling bin doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all good. The majority of items you put in the recycling bin will never be recycled and will go straight to the landfill, that\u2019s just facts. \n\nDoes the public works department in your area give tours of their waste management facilities, many do, that would be a good day trip activity for them lol. I get it, reusable water bottles get a bad taste. But they\u2019re in your house, make them use glasses. If your water is weird get a Big Berkey. No more plastic. Things do not get recycled. It\u2019s wishful thinking. \n\nAnyways besides that NTA. It sounds like there\u2019s stuff going on with the mom and daughter (read your comment about divorce) that has nothing to do with chores. I would either limit the amount of time she stays there, or keep having her do chores, which seems like no big deal. This sounds like the mom is feeling weird and flipping out for no reason. I think it\u2019s cool and fun you let your daughters friends stay with her, good for you. Get rid of the plastic water bottles though omg", "When I was your daughter's age, I often went over to my best friend's house for unexpectedly long stays (a one night sleepover might turn into a weekend, or even longer). That usually meant I was roped into whatever plans the family had while I was there, and her mom would ask me to out however I could - washing dishes, cooking, typical teenage chore stuff. And I'll be honest, I LOVED it. I loved that when I was at my friend's home, her parents treated me like I was a third daughter, with the same responsibilities and expectations as my friend. It made me feel like I was a part of the family rather than a guest, and it soothed the anxiety I had that I was taking advantage of their generosity when I stayed for a long time (especially since for various reasons my friend and I rarely hung out at my own home). \n\nNTA, and not only do I think it's appropriate that you ask your daughter's friend to help her with her chores, she might even thank you for it 10 years down the line.", "Back when I was in high School my best friend and I wound alternate whose home we stayed at during the summer. We both were expected to help the other with chores and neither of us really saw this as wrong or strange. \n\nSo, to me, You're NTA.", "NTA. Is she just supposed to sit and stare while your daughter clears the mess they both made? Part of being a good guest is not adding to the workload of your host.", "Exactly. What OP is doing is perfect. It helps ensure that this kid has got valuable life skills, and it helps them to feel like they really belong in your home. It can be easy to feel like you\u2019ve overstayed your welcome after such a long time, and it can be exhausting to tiptoe around.  If she\u2019s a regular fixture at the house, and if you are feeding her on the regular as if she\u2019s a part of your family, she can absolutely contribute. It also heads off any situations where being the house everyone comes to could potentially bite you - if she feels invested in the upkeep and maintenance of the dynamic in your home, she (and everyone else as well) is less likely to treat it like a crash pad and take advantage. \n\nIt\u2019s not as if you asked this woman for money for all the food you\u2019re giving her child while she\u2019s basically living in your home. She sends her kid off to someone\u2019s house and they come back fed, bathed, and fully laundered, and she berates you instead of thanking you? Nah.\n\nHowever, if your family wants to set boundaries in terms of length of stay, asking to stay, indefinite stays\u2026 have that conversation.", "And it sounds like a healthy and welcoming dynamic", "Put things away when you get out of the pool.\n\nArgh!

At all.", "Okay, this made me smile. Thank you.

No way, no how and it sounds like it\u2019s actually some good structure for the girl. \n\nWhenever I did extended stays at a friends house, I volunteered to help with dishes and cleaning because I knew they were paying for me to live there. Utilities and groceries are not inconsequential costs. Chipping in on house duties was the least I could do in exchange for staying with them for a week. A month is crazy to just bum it out without helping around the house. Sounds like her mom is just being immature and self conscious.", "NTA\nHaving kids help around gives them responsibility and helps them feel included, it\u2019s a really normal thing to do. Especially a best friend who is round all the time, it\u2019s actually nice, it probably makes them fee really welcome and at home and not treated like a guest.", "NTA I grew up in *the house* friends came to when there was trouble at home. All our friends knew it was a safe space, there were condoms in the jar in the entry hall, and where the laundry detergent was. They cleaned up after themselves even when they weren't staying.", "Clearly NTA. The mom is using you for day care of her child.  I'd continue doing what you are already doing. You are teaching your daughter good life skills with out turning her into servant. If the other mom continues to complain, perhaps send your daughter to her house for a couple of weeks.", "It\u2019s also just a good life skill/habit to be a good guest, one who helps out here and there and cleans up behind themself. People appreciate good guests, they are more likely to be willing to host good guests. OP is helping set this girl up with that habit and it can be helpful for her down the road in her life.", ">You are asking her to do basic chores that she should do as a good house guest and teaching her some life skills.\n\nThat's what's killing me. These are (mostly) things I'd expect my child to do at someone else's house as a guest, and I'd be shocked and horrified to find out that they had to be told/asked to do it. \n\nNot to mention that the girl doesn't seem to have a problem with it, so I don't see why her mum should.", "> she\u2019s been here for so long because she wants to\n\nSo if she wants to be there for so long then why is she complaining to her mom about you?

If you have the ability (and desire), you could teach them how to make pasta and sauce from scratch and with disposable pans, they could have something to take home.", "You could also ask her to volunteer somewhere too, instead, if you've got the house managed and it wouldn't add too much to your load to help her (and maybe friend) get there. \n\nEither way, great work and NTA for sure.", "Have you tried water filters?

Oh, no! They had to scoop some leaves out of a pool?! That lady needs a serious reality check.", "It depends on a lot of factors, such as how well off the family doing the care is, whether the child requires any expensive items or items the care taking family would not otherwise have, any outings planned and the general relationship between the two families.  For example, everything else being equal, I wouldn't expect to pay my sister for watching my kids, but I would at least offer cash to a friend's parent.", "I agree.

She noticed how I was there all the time eventually and sometimes on the way somewhere my friend would ask her to pick me up on the way rather than wait until they were heading home. So, she asked her daughter what was up, why was I constantly around and why would she insist on picking me up and dragging me boring places, like to run errands or go to sports practices? She told her things weren\u2019t good for me at home and she wanted to help me/I liked being around her family. So her mom\u2019s response was to make sure I always felt welcome. She would let me stay over there even if my friend wasn\u2019t home or was out of town. She made me feel loved.\n\nI will never forget her.

She sounds like a gem of a human.", "My mom was PISSED when she found out my best friends mom gave me chores every time I went over there (the minimum about of days was 3 but max was a month) but like, i felt insanely weird not helping, like I was using them if I didn\u2019t help??? Some parents just don\u2019t like the idea of another parent putting responsibilities into their child.(but I also think my mom had an issue with it bc I wouldn\u2019t do chores at my own home, but that might be a mental illness thing, like I felt more responsible doing chores at someone else\u2019s place rather than my own) You are NTA", "I can see it either way, but I would still consider her to be a \u201cguest,\u201d and someone I would still be careful not to impose too much of my parenting on. To the extent she wants to help my kid do her chores, fine, but I don\u2019t think it would be something I can MAKE her do. It would be my kid\u2019s responsibility to look after her most of the time, and if she couldn\u2019t, then perhaps it would be time for her friend to go home. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying what you did was entirely unreasonable, but in my culture, a guest gets a special place in the home until they\u2019re not a guest anymore, and I guess we may just have different standards on when someone stops being a guest, and becomes more of a tenant.", "NTA- my kid\u2019s best friend is basically my spare child, she gets chores lol", "NTA. seems reasonable tbh", "NTA. I like that she hasn't been parenting her daughter for a MONTH because she is with you, yet you're the lazy AH.", "NTA\n\nAnd where does this woman get off screaming at the person housing and feeding her child FOR A MONTH!!!!", "Cleaning up after yourself isn't really chores. Mom needs to STFU and say thank you for having her", "NTA\n\nWith the exception of cooking dinner, every chore you described is just her picking up after herself. And apparently she's fine with cooking dinner. So I don't see any harm in the chores, especially given how long she's stayed.", "NTA. From what you've written you're a second mother (and primary caregiver) to a child in need. You're basically a foster parent without the paperwork or legal standing, but her mom was happy with the situation until she felt called out. \n\nI think skimming the pool is going too far, you have to maintain your own pool unless she volunteers to deal with the bugs, leaves and all that, but imo that's not general housekeeping. Expecting her to help put away the pool equipment after using it is just good manners, that's fine. If it is a task you trust your daughter with, give them some light supervision and teach them what is expected. \n\nI think helping with dinner (especially if she gets to learn how to cook) and doing her personal laundry (since she has been staying an extended time) seems completely reasonable as long as you hold your daughter to the same, if not higher, standards. \n\nHere's the biggest thing: Sit down with your daughter and her friend and ask if either of them feel like you're unfair.", "I have a close friend that likes to say \"The first time you're at our house, you're a guest. The second time, you're family... so you get to help with chores.\"\n\nSome children are raised doing absolutely no chores,  which it sounds like might be the case here. It would be one thing if the daughter was uncomfortable/unhappy with this arrangement, but I really don't see a problem with you including her. \n\nNTA", "It\u2019s a good idea teaches them responsibility and to contribute ( help cook) for the good of all", "NTA, and I'm not going to comment on the specifics of the post, but share a story. \n\nMy partner's family is the adoptive kind; if you need a place to go, they're there for you. He has 2 bio brothers and 9+ assorted siblings because they kept bringing home strays.\n\nI was talking to one of his bffs about this years later, and he said he knew he was a part of the family once he was also assigned chores. There was a list, he was there all the time, he helped. It made him feel like others wanted him there too.", "NTA, OP. My friends and I were close like this growing up, during school we were home more but it was not uncommon for us to stay together a few weeks at a time in summer, or to go from a week at one persons house to a week at the others. But absolutely it was not as a \u201cguest\u201d, at that point we were treated basically like family and had to follow the same rules as the other kids in the house. I think it was good to be held accountable and feel like I belonged in the space, and it was pretty normal expectation that you just help out. I think it built some of my values as an adult in friendships, if a friend is doing chores or errands or needs help with a big move or project, of course I am there to help because that\u2019s just how friendship works. You are there for good and bad. \n\nIf your kid is not having conflict or wanting space, and you can afford the extra person in the house, I think it is probably good for your daughter and her friend. And it sounds like the friend might get some valuable experience in being self sufficient that she doesn\u2019t get at home", "When my daughter was that age both her and her friend would do the chores. I would give them both a bit of pocket money. Now they\u2019re both grown she still calls me her second mum. Difference is her mum couldn\u2019t get her to do any chores at home unless my daughter was there to encourage her. But she gave them some pocket money too when they did. Definitely NTA.", "NTA.\n\nI did the same thing when I would spend weekends at my friends' houses. It's a completely normal request... you aren't asking too much OP :)", ">If anything you actually incorporated her into your family dynamic.\n\nThat's what I was thinking, it'd be one thing if OP's daughter didn't do chores but it gets forced on the friend, but since OP is just expecting the friend to do the same few chores (which is really just cleaning up after themselves and learning new life skills in the form of cooking) as her own daughter does, it probably makes the friend feel so included and cared for in a weird way. And she'll probably look back at this time fondly once she's an adult. \n\nAnd it seems like they're both enjoying learning how to cook as well and are proud of their achievements. And it makes me sad that the friend's mom reacted so harshly to her daughter showing her something she was incredibly proud of. Kinda makes sense why she doesn't wanna go home. Cause that's just the side of the friend's mom that is shown to the public....", "(My kid also gets chores at her house)", "Are they dating?", "Yeah the biggest red flag in all of this to me is that the girl\u2019s mom was willing to call and get mad but didn\u2019t come get her daughter?? I had lots of sleep overs when I was little, but some days were a no because I had family stuff or chores at my own home to do. A month straight without any formal arrangement just seems neglectful.", "Yeah, I read it. I'm reading between the lines. I'm betting the girl complained to her mom and that's why the mom is flipping out.\n\nI could be wrong but that's why I'm asking the OP, not you.", "I've never asked for money to feed kids at our home and it would never occur to me to do so.  At the same time, when i know my teen's friend group plans to stay at one house for multiple days I check with my teen to see if they have a food plan and I typically give them cash to contribute.\n\nI would say if you're comfortable enough financially that feeding this girl isn't impacting your long term ability to take care of your own family, let it go.  The parents are covering extra cash for activities, which is good.  Asking for money for food will make her feel unwelcome and might make them insist she goes home.  As others have said  it doesn't sound like her home is emotionally safe, and perhaps not physically safe, so it's best to keep the welcome mat out if you can.", "Growing up I ended up at friend's houses a lot. The most comfortable and safe feeling houses in my experience were those where I was expected to help out. It gave me a sense of belonging at times and provided me with the only structure I would have. Even at 8 I understood.\n\nThe only think I can think of taking issue with is that you would be considering any change. Provided you can continue having the girl over without it being some unreasonable burden on your family, continue to do so and maintain your expectations. Do not deviate, this is your house, your rules, let the other parent be the bad guy.", "NTA. If the friend was offended she could go home. Clearly she prefers being in the company of the OP\u2019s home despite a few reasonable chores. Hmm, I wonder why\u2026", "Nta.  See if she will let your daughter crash and not pick up after herself.   Good grief.", "NTA, I don\u2019t see it as an issue. Then again I stayed over my best friend\u2019s house so often that I to vacuum carpet on Saturday.", "NTA kids who came in my house with my kids had the same chores as my kids, they all knew that coming in.

If YOUR kid is going to be spending the summer in MY house, they are helping.\n\n They are using your resources. They are eating your food. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her helping to clean up after themselves.", "No ma'am!! Staying a month??? That's not a guest", "NTA We always did chores when staying with friends, and my kids did too.  That mother sounds over-dramatic.", "NTA\n\nThis is apparently the first time anyone has ever given this girl any example of how to be a good *houseguest*.\n\nThe mother has done her child a deep disservice if she's taught the girl to behave as though people who have welcomed her into their home should be treated like hotel staff and,  even worse,  that she *shouldn't* pitch in & lend a hand when her *friends* are tackling their chores.\n\nNothing you described is age inappropriate and the dinner preparation sounds like a good time was had by all.", "My mom was, too! Yay for safe spaces!", "NTA. I did this when I stayed overnight at my friends\u2019 houses for 1-2 nights. She\u2019s been there for weeks!

If she wants to live with/like your daughter, then she can meet your basement level expectations\n\nOne thought- does the friend feel safe in her home? When I was a teen, I'd stay at my best friend's house (few days max) because I loved the safeness, family atmosphere, laughter, happiness, and feeling of belonging that I didn't have in my own home.

The teens have bestowed upon you the most ultimate title. The adult we feel safe with.", "I was having the same thoughts, and OP has been very accommodating and teaching the kids valuable life skills and not being a freeloader. I mean it\u2019s not like the kids when to grocery shop and paid for the groceries, they made what was directed, and helped out! It\u2019s called being a family! NTA", "NTA. These are very basic tasks that a polite guest would be volunteering to do. Most parents would be mortified if their kid didn't pick up after themselves and help out at least a little in this situation. And you're doing this mom a favor so it's weird she thinks you need to be a servant to her daughter.", "Sahm  is a full time job. NTA", "OP can you please adopt me?! \n\nNTA", "And look, if the kid is taking pictures, she\u2019s enjoying cooking. My mom wasn\u2019t a great cook, so she didn\u2019t cook. This was appreciated and approved by all. But it meant when I went to another kid\u2019s house and their mom was like \u201cwanna make cookies,\u201d I was *embarrassingly* impressed. My friends thought I was a huge ass kiss trying to help out, but for me, chopping up shit and learning basic adulting skills was novel. And I always was happy to go home when the weekend was over because I also liked a house with all the cable channels and a generous food delivery budget. \n\nIf the child living freely in your home didn\u2019t like it, she would go home. She stays for a reason. Mom may both appreciate it and resent it. It\u2019s all fine and dandy when she thinks her kid is living the high life at your house, OP, but to see she\u2019s *being actively parented and enjoying it*, well, that says something about *her* mothering. Probably not enough to get her to take her kid home. \n\nHonestly, she sounds like a piece of work. NTA, but if you can manage tune her out every few months when she rouses herself to bitch at you over the phone, I\u2019d do it for the kid, so she can have a summer away from that house\u2026", "Yeah cleaning up after yourself and occasionally making food is not a big deal"]}
