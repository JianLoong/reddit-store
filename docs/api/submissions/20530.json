I (34F) have a 14 year old daughter. She has a fairly small but incredibly close group of friends, one of which has been here since school let out for summer break (almost exactly a month ago). They spend their days sleeping and their nights swimming and watching movies and giggling like teenager girls tend to do. About a week ago, I started making the friend help my daughter with her usual chores. \n\nAnd for clarity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll explain exactly what I mean by \u201cchores\u201d. Washing her own laundry (I handle mine and my husband\u2019s as well as all the \u201chouse laundry\u201d - towels, blankets, bed linens), loading her dirty dishes into the dishwater (again, I handle mine and my husband\u2019s as well as the \u201chouse dishes\u201d), helping clean up my daughters room (usually just means putting away/cleaning up music equipment, art supplies, and about a million half-empty water bottles and snack wrappers that need to go in the bin), help clean the pool before they go swimming (by this I mean using the net to clean away leaves and bugs but I do the major cleaning - vacuuming, filter changes, pump cleaning, level checks) putting up pool floaties after swimming, and once or twice a week, helping to cook dinner (I handle all other meals/snacks and all the shopping). Considering she\u2019s been here for weeks, I thought this was fair\u2026but the girl\u2019s mom does NOT think it\u2019s fair, and here\u2019s the part where I get called an asshole.\n\nThe girls helped me make manicotti for dinner. The food was delicious and they were both (rightly) proud of themselves for how well it turned out. The friend took a picture and shared it to Snapchat, where her mom saw it. I\u2019m not entirely certain what was said in the conversation between the friend and her mom, but I do know they spoke just before I got an irate phone call from her mom. She said I don\u2019t have a real job (and to be fair, I don\u2019t have an income-earning job, I\u2019m an unemployed SAHM by choice) and that it wasn\u2019t her daughter\u2019s responsibility to feed me and keep my house in order. At first, I had assumed maybe the friend told her mom I was having her \u201cdo chores\u201d but didn\u2019t explain what the chores actually were. I thought her mom might have just jumped to conclusions and thought I\u2019m having her kid clean my house, mow the lawn, and cook us dinner every night. But no, after explaining what exactly it is I was making her daughter do, she was still very angry. She called me a lazy AH before hanging up on me and now I\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s right. Her daughter is a guest in our home, even if it\u2019s a bit of an extended stay instead of her usual 3-4 days before going back home. Should I just leave it at her picking up her dishes/trash and do the rest myself? Is the laundry, pool, and dinner going too far?

This is regardless of the duration of their stay. \n\nCooking together sounds like a fun activity the girls did, especially if she proudly posted on snapchat.\n\nThe girls\u2019 mother is probably annoyed that she is having so much fun at your place.

It would feel\u2026sexist as hell to make a teenage girl cook dinner and it\u2019s not my job to make sure she can cook for herself when she reaches adulthood.

The tasks that you mentioned, like doing her own laundry or loading her dirty dishes into the dishwasher are not really chores, they are more of self-reliance tasks, imo.

And the cooking thing turned out well so no harm no foul there.\n\nI'm actually shocked her mother got angry at you. How dare she. You've been looking after and feeding her daughter for the past month, she should be grateful that you were okay to do this- regardless of whether you're a SAHM mum or not.", "NTA, most of the tasks you mentioned should be done by any household member without even being considered as \"chores\" that need to be established in order to be completed.

My parents loved providing a safe environment for everyone especially since some of my friends had less than stellar home lives. \n\nAll of us were expected to do the basic sorts of chores you've outlined here, whether it was a one day party and we had to put our dishes in the dishwasher and pick up the trash, or an extended stay with additional expectations like helping with meals. One of my friends got into the habit of taking out the trash every time he came over and my mom adored him. \n\nI'm in my 30s now and all of my friends from that time period still speak fondly about my parents. My parents also love to tell stories of how fun those years were. I think you're doing just fine and setting your daughter and her friends up for success.", "NTA. The friend's mom is the AH.

And by help out I mean tidy up what ever mess they've made, help with making dinner and put what ever plates, glasses, cutlery as close as possible to the sink. However, in your situation you have a kid staying for a month and after your phone call with her mother I think I can see why. It is very telling that although her mom was \"horrified\" she still didn't rush over to pick her daughter up and take her away. \nThis is your house and your rules which are so incredibly normal, if your daughter's friend didn't like it, she'd be gone back home.", "Nothing in your post is more important than: Please stop buying single use plastic bottles. Putting things in the recycling bin doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all good. The majority of items you put in the recycling bin will never be recycled and will go straight to the landfill, that\u2019s just facts. \n\nDoes the public works department in your area give tours of their waste management facilities, many do, that would be a good day trip activity for them lol. I get it, reusable water bottles get a bad taste. But they\u2019re in your house, make them use glasses. If your water is weird get a Big Berkey. No more plastic. Things do not get recycled. It\u2019s wishful thinking. \n\nAnyways besides that NTA. It sounds like there\u2019s stuff going on with the mom and daughter (read your comment about divorce) that has nothing to do with chores. I would either limit the amount of time she stays there, or keep having her do chores, which seems like no big deal. This sounds like the mom is feeling weird and flipping out for no reason. I think it\u2019s cool and fun you let your daughters friends stay with her, good for you. Get rid of the plastic water bottles though omg", "When I was your daughter's age, I often went over to my best friend's house for unexpectedly long stays (a one night sleepover might turn into a weekend, or even longer). That usually meant I was roped into whatever plans the family had while I was there, and her mom would ask me to out however I could - washing dishes, cooking, typical teenage chore stuff. And I'll be honest, I LOVED it. I loved that when I was at my friend's home, her parents treated me like I was a third daughter, with the same responsibilities and expectations as my friend. It made me feel like I was a part of the family rather than a guest, and it soothed the anxiety I had that I was taking advantage of their generosity when I stayed for a long time (especially since for various reasons my friend and I rarely hung out at my own home). \n\nNTA, and not only do I think it's appropriate that you ask your daughter's friend to help her with her chores, she might even thank you for it 10 years down the line.", "Back when I was in high School my best friend and I wound alternate whose home we stayed at during the summer. We both were expected to help the other with chores and neither of us really saw this as wrong or strange. \n\nSo, to me, You're NTA.", "NTA. Is she just supposed to sit and stare while your daughter clears the mess they both made? Part of being a good guest is not adding to the workload of your host.", "Exactly. What OP is doing is perfect. It helps ensure that this kid has got valuable life skills, and it helps them to feel like they really belong in your home. It can be easy to feel like you\u2019ve overstayed your welcome after such a long time, and it can be exhausting to tiptoe around.  If she\u2019s a regular fixture at the house, and if you are feeding her on the regular as if she\u2019s a part of your family, she can absolutely contribute. It also heads off any situations where being the house everyone comes to could potentially bite you - if she feels invested in the upkeep and maintenance of the dynamic in your home, she (and everyone else as well) is less likely to treat it like a crash pad and take advantage. \n\nIt\u2019s not as if you asked this woman for money for all the food you\u2019re giving her child while she\u2019s basically living in your home. She sends her kid off to someone\u2019s house and they come back fed, bathed, and fully laundered, and she berates you instead of thanking you? Nah.\n\nHowever, if your family wants to set boundaries in terms of length of stay, asking to stay, indefinite stays\u2026 have that conversation.", "And it sounds like a healthy and welcoming dynamic", "Put things away when you get out of the pool.\n\nArgh!

At all.", "Okay, this made me smile. Thank you.

With 5 their only duty is helping put away the toys they used)\n\nBTW you're actually teaching the kid valuable life lessons.

And being able to cook is even better.", "NTA. When I go to my friend\u2019s houses, I help clean up/put away dishes or help cook, help with laundry if it needs to be done (especially if I\u2019m staying there for more than a sleepover bc my laundry\u2019s probably in there as well), help take out the trash, bring groceries in/put them away, etc. It\u2019s a way to show my thanks for them allowing me into their home, especially if I\u2019m seen as \u201cfamily\u201d since I\u2019ve been friends with them for so long.", "Nta, she's been living with you for a month her helping out isn't an issue", "As a teenager when we would go swimming at friend\u2019s cottage we would ALWAYS put the pool stuff away, clean up after ourselves, do the dishes\u2026 this was the basic level of \u201cwe\u2019re staying with you, leave the place as we found it\u201d payment.

My only response would be \u201cI am treating her as I would any other resident of my house. Nothing is forced upon her, nor is her staying here required or a burden.

We were together often, so her mother started to include me in the chores, to help my friend get it done faster. It felt totally normal. I could either sit and wait for my friend to be done or help her so she would be finished sooner.. the most naturally thing was to help.. \nI never considered it weird because i spent so much time at their house, so it felt a little like a second home, so of course i helped out keeping it tidy.\nOfc your daughters friend can help clean up after herself and cook food. Nothing weird about that whens she spends so much time at your place", "NTA. I was always expected to help my friends with their chores when I stayed over.

She\u2019s even getting cooking lessons now. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It's time for the friend to go home. If her mother is going to become unhinged that she has to clean up after herself while a guest in someone else's house. She can go home, and Mommy can pick up after her. You are an awesome person for opening your home. You do not deserve her treatment when you have been caring for her child for a month.", "It's not your responsibility to child sit for a month for free. Are they sending you money to care for her?

If so after this long she is not a guest and should be helping out. Personally putting her dishes into the dishwasher is just good manners for someone that is living there. \n\nConsider telling the friends mother if she doesn't want her daughter do the bare minimum then the mother can pay you for childcare and food.", "OMG, so this. I would have told her that fine, her daughter can sit on the couch and eat bon-bons all day then, but your rates for childcare are $100 a day and she owes you for a month.", "Even guests should always pick up after themselves, which is the overwhelming majority of what OP has asked this girl to do.", "Even your daughter could do more. Washing the dishes or cooking for everyone a few times a week in the summer is fine.", "Increasing her responsibility a bit now during the summer will help when she gets a summer job.", "Exactly!

It also applies to OP's situation.\n\nThe gist is that chores are different than maintenance. Maintenance is the routine clean-up task that logically follows an activity - such as putting dishes in the dishwasher after a meal or snack rather than leaving them on the table or counter, putting your used bath towel in the hamper instead of leaving it in a heap on the bathroom floor, or cleaning up a spill instead of leaving it. Chores are the lesser-performed but larger/potentially more time-consuming tasks that are done when needed - (following my previous examples) such as unloading the dishwasher and putting dishes away, washing a load of towels when the hamper is full, or vacuuming/mopping the floors.\n\nOP is not having her daughter's friend do chores, like deep clean the pool or spend a day cleaning the kitchen. OP is having the friend do her part of the household maintenance.", "No \"guest\"  stays for a month+. She isn't running an extended stay hotel. This person has become more than a guest and expecting basic cleaning up after yourself is not asking a lot.\n\nSome people have no sense.", "No doubt NTA is different than a long term guest staying for a few days.

Your call with her Mum gave you an idea of that this kid has to deal with.\n\nI think the Mum atm doesn't have a lot of control over her life. She's in the midst of a divorce. Her kid is living with someone else. She's probably working all hours because divorce is expensive. So she's latched onto this chore thing as the one thing she can control. \"That's my daughter and if I say she shouldn't help out while under your roof than you need to listen to me because I'm her parent\". \n\nI'd literally ignore her call. Teaching your kid to cook and clean up after themselves is an important life skill.

Take her to the store with you when you shop- show her how to pick good meat and produce, how to look at prices, check dates on items that expire, check the eggs to make sure none are broken, basic grocery skills.  Never too early to learn basic life skills.  \n\nWe did this the summer my daughter was 15- she was \"responsible\" for 2 meals a week.  She would look up recipes online, make a grocery list, I would take her to the store to shop, I paid, she came home and cooked dinner.
