I genuinely feel so badly for OPs sister.", "Then cut off contact because at this point if she is not invited to your wedding then you have not relationship.  Cut the cord and suffer the consequences. \n\n\nBecause unless abuse happened if I was your parent I would have a hard time supporting your decision.", "Oh the chaos hasn\u2019t even begun and it\u2019s your doing. YTA", "You have created the chaos yourself.\n\nYou\u2019ve already permanently damaged the relationship, but if you follow through you\u2019ll effectively destroy it.", "Info: what do you mean by chaos? Will she show up in white? Did she used to bang your fianc\u00e9? Will she object? Because YTA as you\u2019ve written it right now.", "Wtf YTA. The only chaos is what you decided to unleash by not inviting your *close sister* to your wedding. Yeah siblings fight even close siblings but I would think yall would know better than to not have a fight at your wedding. You never had a fight with your parent or close friend? Come on. \n\n*You* made a mountain out of a molehill. You can certainly forget being close after this one.", "Translation:\n\n\u201cThis post hasn\u2019t gone the way I thought so I\u2019ll drop a hint that she might be trouble.\u201d\n\n**YTA**", "Definitely not worth talking about right? Just skip right to cutting her out of your day? Yeah, definitely SO close. YTA.", "Which is\u2026?", "What chaos? You mean from when you uninvited her before eventually inviting her but in an unaware-selfish way\u2026I could see that I guess.\n\nDo your disagreements generally start with you doing something AHish?", "What, precisely, did your sister do to deserve this suspicion?", "Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight", "Girl at this point I think YOU are the one who cause the chaos and the fights", "I think we need more backstory. What did she do in the past to make your think chaos will ensue?\n\nMy sister is a narcissistic handful and we haven\u2019t had a close relationship since we were kids, but I still had her at my wedding. I was worried but she was on her best behavior.", "Too late. Oh, and YTA", "Yeah yta", "Are you marrying her ex?", "\u2026you\u2019re the problem though", "What chaos?\n\nNothing you've described about her indicates anything is likely to happen at your wedding.\n\nThis doesn't make any sense. You say you're close but I don't think you understand what the word means.", "And yet you say in your post that you\u2019ve always been close. This doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.", "Why? What do you do to her every time you see her?\n\nThe fact you\u2019re not being forthcoming with info tells me you\u2019re the problem. \n\nBy not inviting her you\u2019re signing the death warrant for your relationship with her, which is your right. Just don\u2019t complain when she cuts you off.", "INFO: But why? Why do you always fight when you are together? What or who causes the conflict that gets ugly?\n\nI was leaning toward Y-T-A until I saw this. Now I\u2019m leaning toward N-T-A.", "If that's true, you need to edit that into your post - along with what you fight about / why you two fight?", "As someone who was told she was not welcome to stay at her own sister's wedding, this is the truth. She and I have no relationship. We have not spoken since the day of her wedding. I have lots of questions, but I also realize that I will never have any answers and have come to accept it because I have no choice.\n\nOP, YTA. You destroyed the relationship you had w your sister.", "This doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. She\u2019s OP\u2019s immediate family. Feel like there\u2019s a LOT of information missing in this post", "While apart from each other, we call and text each other and catch up. It has always worked that way. It\u2019s just bad blood physically I guess. We just can never be in the same space.", "Bad blood over what? I feel like there's a lot of details missing here. Your sister clearly expected to come and seems totally blindsided that she wasn't invited. I don't think that you will have any relationship at all moving forward. Including over the phone.", "Then hopefully you don't want to keep in contact with her after the wedding. If you do then how are you going to fix your relationship with her after the wedding?", "But on your big day, you\u2019ll be so busy that you won\u2019t have time for a fight. You\u2019ll be bounced between people or make sure to have a buffer. Ultimately it\u2019s your day, but I\u2019d be awfully upset if my sister did this to me. YTA.", "Yet you say you've always been close... This makes no sense and is quite contradictory. Sounds like you're working on another (mediocre) short story.\n\nYTA.", "You should include this in your post and about always fighting in person.", "NTA If you can\u2019t reliably be in the same space without a fight, it\u2019s reasonable not to risk ruining your wedding. \n\nWhen is the wedding?  Could you practice going out with her without conflict? Who initiates the conflict and is there something that triggers it?  Is the conflict manageable?", "That\u2019s really unfortunate. NTA."]}
