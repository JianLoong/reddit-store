I honestly don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t look at it as free babysitting.

She's living with her mother, she has support, she's not alone and you will be expected to co-parent with her if you do this, and if you do this, you set the expectation up of being a free babysitter. \n\nYou don't co-parent someone else's child. A lot of us are single parents without the other parents support too, a lot of us have mental health issues or disabilities. And we manage to get by without a break every week.
