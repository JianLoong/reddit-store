Mia will have to find other friends so she gets a break or hire a sitter.", "He used to pay all expenses until she threatened him to take him to court for more. It resulted in the custody and expenses being split 50/50. So now they both pay everything equally.

Mia's problems are not your problems.  If you relent, because you wish to spend time with her child and would like the siblings to have some form of relationship going forward then you, of course, need to put some very hard boundaries in place.  She has obviously asked Jay for you to do this and so I suppose he's only the messenger.

He\u2019s bold, she\u2019s not even his girlfriend anymore.", "It sounds like she previously had contact with the kid and they stopped it. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to the kid to be jerked around depending on mums need for support.", "How are they 50/50 if he\u2019s gone for months at a time?", "This does not sound like the kind of person to Help. She will not appreciate your kindness. Only somehow get it into her head that she is entitled to your help and time and money. You will live to regret helping her.", "Yup.  His Ex is complaining about him being gone and his solution is whatever's easiest for him. \n\nOP may not have realized it yet, but her Ex doesn't sound like a very responsible parent.  If there isn't already a child support order in place for her kid, OP should file for that and custody."]}
