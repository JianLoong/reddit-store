Clearly they don't trust their mom at this point and if you had told then all you would have done is shown them that they can't ANY of their family members. Sister needs to get it through her head that she can't force everyone to just move on and pretend the past never happened since it sounds like she's rapidly on the train to ending up NC with her kids", "NTA, they haven't been taking any consideration of the children's feelings. You are doing a good job, I'm sure it makes a massive difference to them knowing that someone hears them.", "NTA.  They are lucky to have a trusted family member.

You gave the kids the one thing they desperately needed: a person they can trust. From the sounds of it: Your sister (and probably her husband, too) decided to try to cope with the grieve by trying to erase it. Which can\u2019t work, of course.", "NTA.

You and your relatives spend four years telling her, and she refused to hear you.\n\nAsk her how many times you were supposed to tell her, when she refused to hear the warnings issued by you and your parents.

As you mentioned, your family talked to your sister when she just got into the new relationship and was erasing everything about her previous husband but she brushed you off.", "NTA. What would be the point of telling your sister how they felt again? So she could completely blow off their feelings yet again? They're both being crap parents.", "Nta. You listened to them, that was what they really needed and you supported them exactly how they needed you to. How could you be ta? You already spoke to your sister and she ignored what you had to say. Imagine how betrayed they would feel if you ran and blabbed to their mom? No you did the right thing. It's really important for kids to feel heard and even if you couldn't change anything at least you could give them that. \n\nYour sister has some nerve, she knew how they felt and  chose to ignore them. Now she wants to blame you for what exactly? Being a good aunt?", "NTA\n\nEveryone needs someone they feel listens to them.  If they think you betrayed their trust they wouldn't feel safe confiding in you.  As long as it is what you said it wasn't your responsibility to tell your sister what the kids were telling you.  They have no reason to trust their mom would listen to what they had to say since when they had that opportunity they were essentially punished for their feelings.  (Having to go therapy and trying to coerce them into changing their feelings instead of understanding that their feelings are as valid as moms are).\n\nI would change this if they had disclosed anything  dangerous.  I would also suggest avoiding offering advice or support towards behavior that would go against what their mom would be OK with.  (One thing to offer support another to undermine their primary parent).", "NTA\n\nI could see an alternative universe scenario, where the grieving mom is just misguided and out of touch and needs help, that you could have gently told her some nonspecifics of what you and the kids talked about, to give her a heads up that her kids are unhappy and things need to change. \n\nThat is not at all this scenario, and it\u2019s obviously extremely disingenuous at this stage for OP\u2019s sister to claim that, had he told her, she would have fixed it.

That is weaponizing therapy. The trust is broken. As others have said, what the kids need is one adult figure in their life whom they CAN trust. It sounds like that is you \u2014 good for you and don\u2019t stop standing up for them :)", "NTA. Your sister is blaming you because you\u2019re a convenient scape goat.

They need to have one stable person in their lives that they trust. Telling your sister would have broken that trust. \n\nIf she wanted to know, she wouldn't have broken their trust. She put her new husband over her kids, consequences be damned. Now she's paying the consequences.\n\nI know as a mom I would like to know if my kids were unhappy about something I could change.

Unless the kids are endangering their safety/lives or the lives of others, you have no obligation to share their PERSONAL conversations with their mother.

Their mother and her husband were never interested in doing what was best for their kids, only what was best for themselves; otherwise they would've gotten the kids some therapy - and *listened to* what the therapist had to say. How a child experiences and works through grief is NOT the same as how an adult goes through it. They've been blindly living in the fantasy family they are trying to force on their children, and didn't see it wasn't working because they didn't WANT to see that.", "NTA. They *confided* in you. And there was nothing life-threatening to break the confidence.", "NTA. She doesn't want them listened to by anyone. She wants them to do as they're told and forget their father existed. You are not in any way in the wrong for listening to those poor kids and letting them feel heard.", "NTA, remind your sister again that the kids did try to talk to her but that ended in four year of family therapy that did more bad than good.
