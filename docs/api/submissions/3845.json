But that is not how things went and almost right away they were asking the kids to remove the step from titles and presenting as a biological nuclear family. Within a year of their marriage all traces of the late spouses and parents were gone also and I know from my sister's two children that they were not given their dad's photos or things. When the kids made their anger about that known they ended up in 4 years of family therapy where my sister and her husband had the goal of changing their feelings and outlook on the situation.\n\nI spoke to my sister and so did a number of family members who felt it was badly handled. But she dismissed us all. So her kids started confiding in me and I did not tell her about it. I know they feel let down by her and they dislike her husband and his kids. I also know they fight with his kids more than my sister and her husband realize. I also know they wish they could move out but even now as teenagers that's not on the table for them until they reach 18. \n\nBut my sister and her husband recently found out the kids were still not happy with the new family. Then my nephew had a big argument with his mom and he told her that I listened better than she did and it was no wonder he and his sister were closer to me when they could tell me anything.\n\nShe confronted me over it and said I should have told her what her kids were saying and done more to help because they were just doing the best for their kids and now it might be too late.

Clearly they don't trust their mom at this point and if you had told then all you would have done is shown them that they can't ANY of their family members. Sister needs to get it through her head that she can't force everyone to just move on and pretend the past never happened since it sounds like she's rapidly on the train to ending up NC with her kids", "NTA, they haven't been taking any consideration of the children's feelings. You are doing a good job, I'm sure it makes a massive difference to them knowing that someone hears them.", "NTA.  They are lucky to have a trusted family member.  I had an older cousin that I could confide in when I was a teen and I was so grateful.", "NTA\n\nClearly the kids confide in you because they know they can trust you and based on past history it sounds like she has been quite dismissive of them \n\nAll I can say is good luck to her!!! It\u2019s NOT healthy to just erase a parent because they\u2019re deceased and try to \u201creplace\u201d them\n\nKeep letting the kids know you will always be their biggest allies and that they can always tell you anything and it won\u2019t get back to your sister \n\nTell your sister if she doesn\u2019t want to permanently ruin the foundations of a relationship with her kids and wonder why in years to come none of them speak to her anymore maybe she needs to actually be a parent and start supporting, nurturing them and stop being so dismissive towards them \n\nI suspect this is going to backfire on her spectacularly and that also doesn\u2019t bode well for her marriage long term either", "NTA. You gave the kids the one thing they desperately needed: a person they can trust. From the sounds of it: Your sister (and probably her husband, too) decided to try to cope with the grieve by trying to erase it. Which can\u2019t work, of course.", "NTA.  Remind her that you *did* tell her how her kids felt.    You and your relatives spend four years telling her, and she refused to hear you.\n\nAsk her how many times you were supposed to tell her, when she refused to hear the warnings issued by you and your parents.   Ask her what you should have said to her to make her listen.   Literally ask her to say the words she needed to hear.\n\nThen, when she comes up with something, remind her that you *did* say those words (because 10 to 1, you would have.)", "NTA - These kids needed someone who they could trust and that was you. And it is not like you and the rest of your family didnt warn them about it.", "NTA. All kids need a trusted adult who only gives up their secrets if the kid is in danger. This was not the case and you did the right thing. Tell your sister since she failed to be her kids' trusted adult, you stepped up.", "NTA. As you mentioned, your family talked to your sister when she just got into the new relationship and was erasing everything about her previous husband but she brushed you off.", "NTA. What would be the point of telling your sister how they felt again? So she could completely blow off their feelings yet again? They're both being crap parents.", "Nta. You listened to them, that was what they really needed and you supported them exactly how they needed you to. How could you be ta? You already spoke to your sister and she ignored what you had to say. Imagine how betrayed they would feel if you ran and blabbed to their mom? No you did the right thing. It's really important for kids to feel heard and even if you couldn't change anything at least you could give them that. \n\nYour sister has some nerve, she knew how they felt and  chose to ignore them. Now she wants to blame you for what exactly? Being a good aunt?", "NTA\n\nEveryone needs someone they feel listens to them.  If they think you betrayed their trust they wouldn't feel safe confiding in you.  As long as it is what you said it wasn't your responsibility to tell your sister what the kids were telling you.  They have no reason to trust their mom would listen to what they had to say since when they had that opportunity they were essentially punished for their feelings.  (Having to go therapy and trying to coerce them into changing their feelings instead of understanding that their feelings are as valid as moms are).\n\nI would change this if they had disclosed anything  dangerous.  I would also suggest avoiding offering advice or support towards behavior that would go against what their mom would be OK with.  (One thing to offer support another to undermine their primary parent).", "NTA\n\nI could see an alternative universe scenario, where the grieving mom is just misguided and out of touch and needs help, that you could have gently told her some nonspecifics of what you and the kids talked about, to give her a heads up that her kids are unhappy and things need to change. \n\nThat is not at all this scenario, and it\u2019s obviously extremely disingenuous at this stage for OP\u2019s sister to claim that, had he told her, she would have fixed it. She has already been given that chance in the past! \n\nIt is a HUGE red flag \ud83d\udea9 that they\u2019re been in family \u2018therapy\u2019 FOR YEARS with the express purpose/goal of changing their kids\u2019 feelings about the situation\u2014after they told her how they felt! That is weaponizing therapy. The trust is broken. As others have said, what the kids need is one adult figure in their life whom they CAN trust. It sounds like that is you \u2014 good for you and don\u2019t stop standing up for them :)", "NTA. Your sister is blaming you because you\u2019re a convenient scape goat. Now she doesn\u2019t have to admit responsibility for her poor relationships with her own children. You did the right thing by being a trusted adult the kids could confide in\u2026it sounds like they weren\u2019t even allowed to tell the truth in therapy.", "These kids have a fundamental trauma, the loss of a parent in early childhood, that has been swept under the rug by their surviving parent, in an attempt to re-create her ideal family situation. \n\nThis mom, and I\u2019m going to preface this by saying that I understand the loss of a spouse is also traumatic and horrible and painful, has done a lot of harm to these kids with the way she handled herself moving forward.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA, OP. You\u2019re honouring the kids by being a safe space for them to process their circumstances and grief. \n\nYour sister is an adult that is developmentally competent to process her loss. The kids were not.", "INFO: Did your niblings try to talk to their mom about some of the stuff they confide in you about? Did you keep anything dangerous from  her?\n\nEdit after OP responded: NTA. They needed someone to trust and thank goodness they had you. It\u2019s a shame their mom wasn\u2019t able to hear what they needed, but that was her choice and now she gets to experience the consequences of her actions.", "NTA Those kids *need* you. They need to have one stable person in their lives that they trust. Telling your sister would have broken that trust. \n\nIf she wanted to know, she wouldn't have broken their trust. She put her new husband over her kids, consequences be damned. Now she's paying the consequences.\n\nI know as a mom I would like to know if my kids were unhappy about something I could change. But that's why I maintain a trusting and loving relationship with them and foster open communication. Their needs are my priority.", "NTA. Unless the kids are endangering their safety/lives or the lives of others, you have no obligation to share their PERSONAL conversations with their mother.  You are right to be there for them, and have done nothing wrong. Their mother and her husband were never interested in doing what was best for their kids, only what was best for themselves; otherwise they would've gotten the kids some therapy - and *listened to* what the therapist had to say. How a child experiences and works through grief is NOT the same as how an adult goes through it. They've been blindly living in the fantasy family they are trying to force on their children, and didn't see it wasn't working because they didn't WANT to see that.", "NTA. They *confided* in you. And there was nothing life-threatening to break the confidence.", "NTA. She doesn't want them listened to by anyone. She wants them to do as they're told and forget their father existed. You are not in any way in the wrong for listening to those poor kids and letting them feel heard.", "NTA, remind your sister again that the kids did try to talk to her but that ended in four year of family therapy that did more bad than good. She failed her kids, not you. She should have listened to them rather than wanting you to tattle to her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
