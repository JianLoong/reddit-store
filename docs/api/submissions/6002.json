The only place I can see that you went wrong here is not having your kid help you clean the walls immediately. \n\nNAH (edit from NTA) though. Not all parenting and discipline requires punishment.\n\nETA: I actually don\u2019t think that your husband is TA either for locking his office door so your son can\u2019t get in, at least temporarily.

He saw an adult in his family - a point of reference in his life - doing something and he imitated, believing he was doing a good thing for his dad.  At that age it is normal behavior.\n\nAnyway, the walls in the home office are messed up and this is an inconvenience for your husband, I understand why he's pissed. \n\n But why did MIL, who was supervising the child, do nothing to stop him? \n\n I think you should sit your child down and try to calmly and gently explain to him why he shouldn't do this anymore.  He alone is unable to understand.  If you don't intervene, you'll soon have all the walls in your house messed up.", "YTA.\n\nBet you wouldn't have the same reaction if the kid did this in the nursery, or your bedroom or your living room.", "Good job OP! YTA!", "Kinda. I get where you are coming from. He's only 3 and saw you drawing on a wall then painting it. However, what he did was wrong. What if you go to a friend's home and he does this? Going to tell him \"good job\"?", "The mother in law sounds like the major AH here", "ESH.  Gently.  Vandalizing?  Really?  He doesn't understand the concept.  Dad needs to let this one go.

He's three and he didn't understand that drawing on the walls was wrong since *you* are doing it. \n\nBut your husband is right; you shouldn't be *encouraging* this unless you *want* the kid to keep scribbling on the walls, which your husband clearly does *not*.\n\nAnd what's the problem with your husband keeping his office door locked to prevent it?", "YTA. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t teach your son not to do this if you praise him for this, when while I can see where you and your son was coming from as to why he did it, he still should have been told why it\u2019s not a good thing to just randomly scribble on walls.", "NAH\u2026 a 3 year old is not responsible, and is emulating a parent.  This should be used as a teaching moment, have him help paint over it and explain that drawing on walls is only something grownups are allowed to do.  Maybe put some big paper on the wall and tell him it\u2019s ok to draw on that.  But in the moment I think what you did was ok.

IT'S VANDALISM!!\"", "Yta but softly, you did not have bad intentions. What you could have said is :\n\n\"Mommy does it in the nursery with special tools but she also has permission from herself and daddy ~~and the baby~~ to do it. I know you wanted to make daddy a surprise but you did not have our permission. We are not mad but dont do it again, next time use a paper and we will be very happy! Say sorry to dada now!\"", "NAH but you picked the wrong wording. Saying \"good job,\" implies that he did the right thing. And stating to use paper next time is probably confusing, because he doesn't know why what he did is different than the mural. \n\n\nYou can acknowledge that the intent and picture were nice, while still saying the action (\"job\") wasn't. \n\n\nYou can tell him the drawing was nice, while also telling him that he can't draw on the walls or anything but paper, without Mommy or Daddy being there and asking their permission.  \n\n\nAnd there is absolutely nothing wrong with your husband now locking his office. \n\n\nWas he never told that he can't go into Daddy's office? Because even if the intent was nice, if he's not supposed to be in the office, that should be talked about, too.", "NAH, but I'm a (part time business) creative person so I sympathize with encouraging that. I'd also be pretty irritated if a three year old was in my home office messing around at all, much less wrecking the walls, so I sympathize with your husband. \n\nI also think its good that he spoke to you privately about it afterwards so as not to disagree in front of your son.", "YTA - you rewarded him for bad behavior, which will encourage him to do it again.", "NAH. As a mother I admire the way you handled the situation. However, I also feel for your husband. That's his workspace. It's not a bad thing to need your own space.", "Nah\n\nLook, your lo saw parent paint on walls as a present for unborn sibling.  Your lo mimicked the action for a present for dad.  You praised the art AND told him to use paper next time.  That is good parenting based on the age and situation.\n\nI don\u2019t blame your husband for being upset though and locking his office.  It is his personal space and he can determine who he wants in it.  \n\nJust reiterate with your son that only in special circumstances should art be done on the wall, but he needs to ask you or your husband.  Otherwise, art is best done on paper.", "YTA because the phrasing \"good job\" will confuse your child. That is praising him for doing an action we don't want. He's only little and will misunderstand.\n\nSome bad parents make the mistake of conflating \"wrong actions\" with \"being a bad person,\" i.e. \"my child broke a vase accidentally so they are bad and inconsiderate.\" Other parents want to avoid this mistake of making their child feel like a bad person, so they tell their child their actions were good even when they weren't. This is you. However, the ideal parent can teach their child that a good person can still make mistakes, and that it's okay when that happens. You don't have to tell him that his actions were good when they weren't, but you also don't blame him or punish him for an honest mistake.\n\nKeep it simple. \"We don't draw on walls without permission, but you can draw a nice picture for daddy on the paper. Mommy had permission to draw on the walls before so that's why she was allowed. It's nice to give people presents, and it's nice that you wanted to give a present to daddy, but in future, give him presents on paper.\" You can even help him do a drawing on paper to give to his dad to reinforce the correct behavior.", "It\u2019s our job as parents to let kids know what is and isn\u2019t appropriate behavior. Telling your son \u201cgood job\u201d is reinforcing drawing on walls. You should have left out the good job entirely. Doesn\u2019t have to be punitive, because his intentions were good, but it is your job to let him know in no uncertain terms that the behavior wasn\u2019t appropriate. \u201cOh no! I see that you wanted to make a pretty mural for Daddy, but we do NOT draw on walls! We ONLY draw on paper.\u201d Very soft YTA.", "Devil's advocate,   if your son goes to a friend or relatives house and scribbles on the wall,  would you say 'good job?'   Or would you groan at the bill you are going to have to pay to repaint?", "Soft YTA because \u201cgood job\u201d probably wasn\u2019t the best approach. He needs to learn that randomly coloring on walls is not an acceptable approach or you\u2019re going to have to do a lot of repainting in the next little while. You need to explain that daddy didn\u2019t want his walls redone in the office and that he needs to get permission before redoing walls in the future, even if he\u2019s doing it to say I love you. \nYou also have a dangerous combination in your house at this point. You are past the point where you should have gathered all the permanent markers in the house and thrown them away to be replaced with washable markers only. Discuss it with him and have him try to scrub the walls he colored on so he understands how serious it is. Then move on and help him make it up to his dad.", "My 3 yr old drew inside my kitchen cabinets with permanent marker. My husband wasn\u2019t happy about at the time. He is 26 now. Now my husband won\u2019t let me change out the cabinets. He has gotten very sentimental over the \u201cdamage\u201d the kids did to the house. It will eventually become one of those wholesome family memories. Buy some art supplies for your budding artist.

Don't scold him or anything. Just explain for a child. \n\nIt will happen again, believe me and that is fine. But if you always tell him that painting on a wall is not as good as painting on paper, because you can hang it on your fridge or something that way will make him understand and he will stop eventually. \n\nMaybe you repaint the wall of your husbands office together with your son. Let him make the fist few lines and then you build from there. He will love to see what comes from 'his' drawing. \n\nAnd tell your husband to cool it. It's a freaking wall not a Picasso with crayons on the surface...", "Yta\n\nScribbling on walls isn't a 'good job'. \n\nWhat you were doing and what he did are completely different..  He's a child, so his scope for rational thinking is limited.  As a parent you job is to widen his knowledge base, so be comes more rational over time.  If you fail to do that he will grow up with the incorrect idea that everything he's done is great, fine.  Hell be confused and resentful when he starts to be told its not.", "YTA. Stop this behavior now! You know he was wrong and instead of correcting you give an excuse and make it sound like it\u2019s adorable!", "YTA\n\nHey, if you want a kid that will scribble all over your walls so you have to constantly repaint them, more power to you.

If you follow gentle parenting practices then what you did was exactly right. You were kind to your child while still telling them what they did was wrong and what they should do the next time. \n\nYour child is 3, and only trying to do something nice.

Will you be saying good job if he do the same to a stranger car, to any public space? There's a big difference between scribbling on wall because you're actually wanting it and doing it on another room where it's not wanted. Like, do we really need to explain this?", "I'm kinda surprised at the consensus here. I am also a parent to a 3 year old little boy. I would say NTA. He learned from you that you were doing a good positive thing by painting his new little soon to be sibling's room. Also that it was a gift to them because you love them. He loves his Dad so he wanted to do the same thing. He's 3. He isn't going to connect the dots that it's ok in 1 room and not the other. He was really happy and excited about showing you guys his work. It would have broken his spirit a little if you reacted negatively. I think you did a good job showing him that you appreciate his efforts to show his love for his Dad and letting him know that next time it's best he draws on paper instead of the walls.", "YTA, it's cute and your husband used too strong a word but it's the wall of an office and both you and MIL let it happen.", "Eh yeah YTA. I know you want to support your son\u2019s creativity, but your job is to be a parent, and part of being a parent is discipline.", "YTA - You sound like one of those insufferable new age parents who don\u2019t believe in saying the word \u201cno\u201d to a child.", "NTA you said good job to acknowledge his efforts he wanted to make a mural like you for his dad. It\u2019s sweet. But you also corrected the action by telling him he has to use paper.

Why are so many Here acting as If three year olds are braindead idiots, who are not capable to understand even the Most simple things and because of that it's useless to teach them anyway? Continue to parent your son Like that, and He will be that child that gets in everyone's nerves because their parents never bothered to teach them basic manners.\n\nAnd it's super effed up, that you let your kid do damage to your husband's personal space, which isn't your space, and give him praise Afterwards.l, especially since your husband is upset because of this", "When my daughter was 3, she drew a picture of my grandparents on the wall of her bedroom.

Sit him down and explain gently why you don't usually use walls, help him make a paper drawing for his dad, and invite him to help clean the walls.\n\nYelling at him for what was intended as a loving gift would have been an AH move, and any commenters who encourage that kind of reaction sound like terrible parents.", "I\u2019m going to have to go with NTA simply because MIL (husband\u2019s mom!!!) was supposed to be watching him when he created the mural.

First off, the OP did the right thing by saying to the child, \"Good job\". And also adding that next time we do that on paper. The child was only doing what he saw his parent do. Children learn by seeing. Anyway, the next step in teaching is to direct the child to the more acceptable alternative which is paper.

She was merely letting the child know that she acknowledged the show of love and then proceeded to guide the child correctly.\n\nWhen you scold a child in a situation like the one mentioned, you can scar the child for life.

I can understand why the husband is upset too but I still think that she was in the right for how she handled it.", "Um. \n\n              \u201cWow what a beautiful drawing but next time let\u2019s use paper/your easel/etc here, come help me clean this up.\u201d \n\nIs not what OP said. In fact, not one word of that overlapped with what OP said.\n\nHer choice of words - \u2018good job\u2019 - was encouraging the exact \u2018job\u2019 of scribbling on dad\u2019s office walls. Not redirecting.\n\nIf I were her H, that door would be locked permanently.", "I agree on all counts. Punishment should be reserved for intentional misbehavior, or you'll make your kid afraid of everything because he literally didn't know what he was doing was wrong.\n\nOP redirected the kid and reminded him to use paper. She could have done without the phrase \"good job\" and gotten the point across, but that feels like an argument over semantics. Her husband also has the right to lock his office door though, that's very fair. \n\nNTA", "He drew on his dad's office walls and thought he was \"making a present\" for him. That's not good behaviour. That's a result of bad parenting that he thinks that. You could go as far as to include him in an E S H vote, but knowing that he's only an AH because his mother is not parenting him well.", "This was the response I was looking for. How is he to know that his drawing is considered scribbles and when Mom does it it\u2019s art.", "All of this! Mom has moved into superstar parenting. It\u2019s hard sometimes to know the \u201cbest\u201d way to respond especially when we get angry, but this is likely the healthiest response I\u2019ve ever seen here. You Rock OP. Husband not doing to badly either.", "He wasn't misbehaving. It was a genuine misunderstanding because he's been watching OP draw on the walls lately. Scolding him for it wouldn't be helpful in this situation. They already corrected the misunderstanding by explaining to him that you're supposed to use paper, and imo should have him help clean the walls so daddy has a \"clean work space\" or something to that tune.", "Did you miss the part where it says she corrected him by saying he needs to use paper next time? If a toddler is excited thinking they did something for someone, that's not misbehaving. \n\nOP, NTA, but like what the other commenters said, just make sure to explain to your kid that they can't paint their dad's office walls. But you're not the AH for saying \"good job.\" I also do that with my nieces and nephews when they do something for me, but I make sure to explain things to them if what they did was not right or if something needs correcting.", "I would've had the same reaction even if he had done it in one of those places. It can easily be covered or fixed.", "this made me cackle a little", "OP wasn't drawing on the walls, she was painting a mural. How does he translate that to scribbling with a crayon and thinking it was somehow a gift for his father?", "I agree with the NAH but don't agree with 'good job' being the right thing to say. I can imagine a child of three mistakingly thinking they 'made a present' bc it's what mummy does for the baby as well,so I don't think he should be scolded for that or anything. I do think that they should have told the boy that even though the gesture was sweet, he should ask his parents for permission and that not every wall needs to be scribbled upon, that it's only reserved for the really special walls.", "How is it emulating? OP was painting a mural, son scribbled on a wall.", "Permission from herself? The kid had permission from himself. That\u2019s not a real thing. She didn\u2019t have any permission from the baby any more than the kid did. And saying she had permission from her husband is gross. \n\nWhat are \u201cspecial tools\u201d? Had the kid used her tools would that be okay? \n\nThere is no need to make up dumb nonsense like this.", "How would they have permission from an unborn baby? What's the point in lying, especially about consent which is another important topic?", "Before this, he would sit in there for an hour everyday while my husband worked so there's never been a rule that he can't go in there. The only time he wasn't allowed was if my husband was on an important call.", "How did she reward him? There was no mention of her giving him anything. She didn't even hand him a piece of paper, she just said that next time he should use paper.", "She needs to teach her \u201cbudding artist\u201d that crayons do not belong on walls.", "Right? My son left hot chocolate hand prints on our wall. When we painted we painted around it. As soon as I find the time I\u2019ll draw a pretty frame around it.", "This right here \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4c", "That's not the same thing though. This 3yo thought it was the same as mother painting a mural and that it was a gift for father. That would need parental intervention to stop those thoughts.", ">And tell your husband to cool it. It's a freaking wall not a Picasso with crayons on the surface...\n\nI personally feel the husband handled this very well. He said nothing in front of the child and only talked to OP about it. How should he \"cool it\" exactly? Isn't dialogue a good thing?", "Not praising something is not the equivalent of screaming or beating someone.\n\nWhen your child does something that you\u2019d prefer they not do again, you can gently guide them without including any praise. It\u2019s possible to live a happy life without your every move being praised and complimented.", "I agree though I'm going NAH because good on Dad for holding it in when he clearly doesn't agree on this. He's also locking the door to the office to prevent it happening again which is honestly a good move with any 3 year old.  OP handled it smoothly, encouraged his creativity and his desire to help while calmly telling him not to do it again and to draw on paper. It's a first time common issue for kiddos and it should be met with first time reprimand. Like it's a wall not grandma's face or prized Mon\u00e8t.", "This isn't 'gentle parenting'. LOL.       Gentle parenting involves correcting misbehavior gently and without revenge as a motivation.  Using clear, simple, direct language about the act and making it clear the act was not ok, but the act is not the same as the person.    \n\n\nIn fact 'good job' is a phrase you'd avoid in general, simply because it creates a feedback loop where the kid needs external gratification.  Those of us who practice gentle parenting tend to stick with remarks like \"I saw how long you worked, and how hard you concentrated.   You've been practicing doing xyz and I can see that.    You must be very proud of how your work is paying off.\"    \n\n\nAnd in this case we would say \"Junior!   Markers do not go on walls and you know that!

Who leaves a three year old unsupervised enough to accomplish this mess in a room he presumably shouldn't generally be in anyway?  She seems like a substantial AH component not even being addressed here.\n\nYour husband is right to lock the door to keep his son out, but not in a cranky, resentful way, just because it acknowleges that its the \\*adult's\\* responsibility to keep off-limits areas inaccessible to children this small.", "THIS ....it was my first thought....what else could have that child gotten into while Grandma was supposed to be watching him", "She didn't praise him, she said his drawing was good but that he should use paper next time.

It's about showing that they're allowed to do this thing, but in a way that's not harmful or destructive. Because it's not the drawing that's bad here, it's where it was.

Nice approach with the kid and all, but kid did something bad and received a praise for it so how's that N.T.A.? \nYes the kid wanted to do something nice, but if it is done on someone else's property, permission is required.

Punishment means to inflict harm and suffering for a crime or fault. Discipline and punishment do NOT go hand in hand. The role of a parent is to teach a child how to be a functioning adult. Inflicting harm on a 3 year old for a completely innocent and naive act of love and kindness is the exact recipe for the child to learn their care taker is not a safe space, which will domino into countless preventable hardships if this method of parenting is continued. The goal is to be a child's safe space, not their place of fear. \n\nOP is NTA. Years ago a friend of mine was pregnant with her first. She had graduated a decade prior with an early childhood development degree and had been a professional nanny her entire adult life, she was phenomenal with all children. We were talking about how we all thought she would be as a mom. I shit you not my prediction was she would be the kind of mom that would turn the corner and find her child coloring on the wall with a sharpie and she would get down on the floor with her child and say \"this is beautiful, tell me about it\" and she would listen to her child. She would then EXPLAIN why coloring on the walls is not the best option, she would give appropriate options and they would paint the wall back together. Literally everyone agreed with me. She went on to have 3 more children and 100% is that mom. The moment I explained my perspective I realized my mom would've freaked out, hit me and repainted it herself while bitching about what I did, which was the moment the rose colored glasses came off the fact that my mom was an authoritarian tyrant who demanded blind compliance from her sheep. I have since learned about the styles of parenting and fully believe authoritative is the most healthiest method of parenting. My 2 year old colored on walls and furniture for awhile so after a few times of giving him the rag to wash it off I took the coloring stuff away for a few weeks. I can now trust him with leaving crayons and markers within reach because he has learned the acceptable surfaces to color on. He can trust me in respecting his autonomy and that I will not inflict harm or suffering on him which is SO important to me since I have never felt trust, support or protection from my mom.\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parenting/parenting-styles\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK568743/\n\nhttps://www.verywellfamily.com/types-of-parenting-styles-1095045\n\nPlease do some reading on authoritative parenting to learn how to effectively use this situation as a teaching moment.

Teaching the concept of what is theirs and what is not and how to ask someone else for permission to use, take, borrow etc someone else's things. This is best started around age 1 but, if neither parent has done this yet it's not too late to teach good solid boundaries and agency now.\n\nThe only thing punishing the child would have accomplished in this case, is to confuse him as to when it's appropriate to express love given that his \"mural\" was a an incredible gesture of wanting to give something special to his father, any negativity associated with that act would have no positive benefit.

Offering that same gift to their father was a sweet gesture. \n\nThe mother corrected the toddler noting that they should have drawn on paper rather than the walls. \n\nNow, if the toddler draws on the walls again, they've done something wrong, and they should be gently admonished for having not followed their mother's instructions to use paper. \n\nAdmonishing a toddler for doing something wrong when it had never been made clear to them it was wrong, and in fact the opposite had been unintentionally implied, would just confuse the child.

Uh, no. I think just a request to use paper next time will suffice. There IS no legitimate reason why they can't in this situation that doesn't hurt or further confuse them about why it's okay for mommy but not me. Just redirect their efforts in a way you will appreciate more next time and leave it at that.", "So I don't necessarily agree, but it could be kid based.  Toddlers are not particularly empathetic at this age or translate \"good job\" to mean anything other than \"yay me\".  I don't think they really understand what \"this made mommy proud, happy, mad, etc.\" means with cause and effect.  They are very self-absorbed.  Yelling at the kid could make him feel \"oh poor me\" instead of \"mommy is mad\" because it makes him feel bad to not get praised or get yelled at.  \n\nThe key is constructive phrases at the end that toddler can understand like \"we need to use paper next time\".

Praise her and show her how to keep the praise coming and that's all the carrot she needed to be taught the correct behavior we wanted.

I say NTA!", "I think NTA because you encouraged your son, you didn\u2019t make him feel like he did a bad thing when all he wanted to do was something nice for his dad. \nThis little boy saw mommy painting a mural and wanted to do the same thing. \nHe tried, he\u2019s 3. \nWhy yell and disciple a child for doing what they saw their mom do exactly? \nWalls can be washed, that little boy will feel as though he did something nice and won\u2019t feel bad about trying and making a gift for his dad. \n\n\u201cPlease use paper next time\u201d is the best thing you can say ! \n\nAnd I say this as someone who would have gotten yelled at, criticized, and punished for trying to do something sweet.

Even down to \u201ccan I take a shower?\u201d \nKids don\u2019t need to be yelled at for punished for trying to do something sweet\nThey need encouragement and love and if they mess up, they need to understand that their heart was in the right place, but shown how to correct the behaviour for next time (literally the mom saying use paper next time) \n\nNTA IMO", "Uhhhhh idk why so many people are saying yta. Your kid is three he doesn\u2019t need punished for trying to do something nice for his dad. You acknowledged that he was trying to do something nice and told him he made a mistake drawing on the walls and next time to use paper. You talked to him like a person. And also like a 3 year old.

That's actually ideal behavior-shaping technique.", "NAH \n\nI understand your intentions were good BUT, as an early education teacher I need to make a few points that I think need to be tweaked from your response. \n\nYou saw your son, who's still a toddler, who imitated you and was looking for approval and your automatic response was to give it to him but you gave him a conflicting response instead.\n\nLet me clarify first, I'm NOT BY ANY MEANS saying you should have scolded him or yelled at him or be mad at him in any way shape or form. That's not a thing to do here. \n\nHe saw mommy doing something pretty and wanted to do the same for daddy. You could have said \"you wanted to make a mural for daddy? Like mommy is doing for your little brother? I know you did and that's very sweet of you. However we have to ASK permission. Mommy talked to daddy before painting on the walls and mommy and daddy agreed mommy would make a painting on THIS wall. I know you wanted to paint something for daddy but you should have asked first, so we could help you find something to paint on. Unfortunately we can't paint on this wall but you can help me clean this out and I can help you so you can make a new painting super pretty for daddy to have in his office, do you want to pick out a special paper and the paints for you to do a special painting for daddy's office?\"\n\nYou could also tell him that if he wants to make a pretty painting for little brother he can, and give him a space on the nursery walls so he can make something all of his own for his little brother too\n\nI know your intentions were good but is confusing for a child to say \"you did good but don't do it again\". If you explain age appropriately and help them learn how to go about in the future by establishing a boundary, they can learn better. You have to be clear with him that mommy and daddy aren't mad at him. \n\nYou (your husband needs to understand he) can't be mad because your toddler is not a grown adult and he didn't know there was that boundary, he can't have the \"common sense\" of not scribbling on walls if he's a toddler and sees mommy do it so he has a need that can be met, which is painting something (doing something pretty for daddy like mommy is doing) by giving him the best means to do so. Like helping him select a \"special paper\", helping him choose the paints he wants to use. You're participating by letting him choose what to use and teaching him what to do next time. And while he paints or searches for his tools you can gently remind him. What do you do next time you want to paint something pretty for mommy or daddy or little brother? You ask for a special paper so you can paint all you want. Is a good way to redirect because all children even if they don't see you \"scribbling\" on the wall, all children do that.", "I\u2019d definitely say it was a poor choice of words, but it doesn\u2019t put you on the asshole list.

NAH.\n\nYou had the right approach by not punishing him for trying to do something nice, but in the future I\u2019d recommend altering how you say it in a way that doesn\u2019t discourage creativity and acts of kindness, but also doesn\u2019t encourage something that negatively affects others.   \n\nSomething that helped my daughter through this phase was explaining that when walls are coloured on, they\u2019ll have to be cleaned or covered up, and then the picture will be gone forever.

How could getting upset or mildly punishing them help them learn anything? In their mind they didn't do anything wrong, and I agree with them. They got guidance for next time and that's all that was needed. \n\nNext time they'll use paper. It's not a big deal and dad needs to chill out. Parenting is only going to get more challenging and he needs to figure out his stance now. \n\nGood job OP. :)", "If he was any older than 3 I would think YTA. As it is I think you handled this correctly.", "NAH Sure, you could have skipped the good job, but you did tell him to use paper next time and you can have a follow up convo explaining that we don\u2019t surprise people with gifts like that (a big wall mural requires consent and input from the recipient). But the most important thing is to not crush your son over something he did with good intentions and is fairly easily repaired. He\u2019s young enough that this isn\u2019t some pattern of behavior you need to worry about. \n\nOtoh, I can see where your husband didn\u2019t appreciate the \u2018good job\u2019 when it\u2019s his stuff that got drawn on. And I don\u2019t think locking the office door is a bad idea. Who knows what the kid or this new baby will get up to in the future? It\u2019s ok for parents to have their own spaces and to teach the kids to respect those spaces. It doesn\u2019t sound like he punished the kid or said anything mean to him.", "\n          \"while my mother-in-law was watching him.\"\n\nOkay, so MIL watched the kid draw all over the office walls?   I don't know why husband and OP don't have an issue with MIL. \n\n\nBut yes, OP should have explained that painting on the walls is not allowed.", "Did your husband actually use the term vandalism? For his 3 year old toddler? That\u2019s a bit dramatic. \nWhat explanation did your mother in law give for not watching him? \nYou are NTA you handed the situation with grace and understanding. \n\nBut wtf you and your husband need to have a serious conversation with your MIL about leaving a toddler unsupervised that\u2019s so dangerous.", "NTA. Locking his office is probably a good idea.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is the AH, but your husband is right that \u201cgood job\u201d was *not* the way to go about this. I do understand why you said it, and that this is confusing for the child as you\u2019re painting a mural literally *on the wall*. However, as an early childhood educator & a parent to a 3yo and 1.5yo (pregnant with our third now) the wording I would have personally used would be closer to \u201cwow! I can see that you drew a beautiful picture, but the walls are *not* the place to do this. You may not ever draw on the walls, only paper. Now you get to help me clean it up. when we make messes, we are responsible for cleaning them up. Let\u2019s get to it, kid.\u201d \n\nTake the opportunity to explain what a mural is and the difference between a mural and coloring on the walls Willy nilly. \n\nChildren need to understand that there are good and bad actions, and consequences for both of those actions. The action here was bad. The natural consequence is cleaning up the mess. Simply having someone repaint teaches the child nothing about taking responsibility for their actions. You don\u2019t need to crush his spirit or his excitement, *but he needs to learn from this.* \n\nA magic eraser and some \u201cPink Stuff\u201d should do the trick, mom. No need to repaint. \n\nno one gets it right every time! No AH here just learning parents.", "NTA\n\nI think people need to consider the fact that this child is ONLY THREE YEARS OLD\n\nThis kid, who still is mentally an infant imo, saw his mother drawing on the walls, and wanted to emulate what she was doing. He learned from his own mother that drawing on the walls is not only allowed, but is also a wonderful gift (lol)\n\nThis is just a misunderstanding and would probably be very confusing for the kid if they had chosen to scold him. Plus, mom was right to say it was easily fixable. \n\nThere is still time to try and gently explain to their child that no one can draw on walls unless mom says so (or something along those lines). \n\nScolding doesnt really work at this stage as idk that a 3 year old would really grasp why they are being yelled at or punished. Its usually best to just gently explain things to them until they better understand things.", "YTA. He\u2019s 3. Natural consequences, but short and sweet. \u201cUh oh. We color on paper. Can you help me clean up?\u201d While you\u2019re cleaning, you can talk about making Dad a card or a picture on paper.", "NAH. I'm just imagining him all excited and proud to show you his work. He would have been crushed at anger or scolding. While many people feel saying \"good job\" is misleading him, you did follow it up with redirection and I very much agree with another poster who said that it's good parenting. \n\nI am probably biased though as there are definitely a couple of sharpie additions around here from my son. He was redirected to use paper, but honestly it makes me smile to close the kitchen door and see a little crooked smiley face at 4 year old height (he's nearly my height now)", "Wow, how else can you show you never wanted kids and don't want to deal with them? He obviously thinks its below him to parent, and then criticizes the was you doing it alone. Does he involve himself in any parenting duties? Or is he like a live in boss with benefits?", "You are an awesome Mom.  Nothing close to an a-hole.  Your husband is not an a-hole but he is woefully out-of-touch with what would be an age-appropriate response to this situation.\n\nYou, however, have great instincts.  Your son had the best of intentions (expressing his love for his dad) and acted on them in a way that is completely logical for a three-year-old.  He was not being malicious.  He was not reacting in anger.  It was an expression of love.\n\nYour husband wants to react to this as if your son were eight instead of three and were purposefully vandalizing his space as an expression of anger.  \n\nYour husband is absolutely wrong that you are encouraging vandalism.  You encouraged your son's loving behavior and you redirected him to an appropriate medium without tearing down his self-esteem and belittling his work to show his dad how much he loves him.\n\nThough this may seem insignificant, getting your husband on the same page about this is really important because issues can get bigger and more significant as your kids age.  Kids don't want to feel judged when they are just trying to figure out life, and especially if they are trying to do something nice for someone.  They will be left with the feeling that their efforts are never \"good enough\" for a parent, which may lead them to not even try.", "NAH.  here's why:\n\n1. The child is three, they don't understand why they can't paint on the walls to show love when they see their mother doing this for their future sibling. They were just copying a parent.\n\n2. The mother did they right thing by encouraging the art, BUT at the same time telling the 3 they need to use paper next time.\n\n3. Husband rightfully upset that the child wasn't watched properly and got into office and drew on the walls. \n\nHere's my problem with the whole scenario. Husband should ALWAYS lock the office for when not in use. That's where he works and a toddler had no business being in there inspected. \n\nThis happen while MIL was watching the toddler... Why isn't the MIL watching the toddler more closely? \n\nLocking the door and closet supervision would have prevented this in the first place", "My 3 year old grandson did this. We all laughed and took pictures of it and used one of those Mr Clean white sponge things and it all came right off\ud83d\ude44. Also put the crayons up and he can use those when he\u2019s with one of us lol. I mean. They\u2019re 3\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "After reading all the advice on Reddit regarding children, I realize that I was raised by wolves.", "I mean you told the kid he needed to use paper next time. That should be sufficient for now unless he does it again. But your husband also has a right to lock his door to his office to ensure it doesn't happen again either. Really, the kid doesn't need to be in his office at all.  This is a non-issue unless it becomes a repeat problem.", "My kid, when she was around 2, dumped her daddies 250$ headphones into a bucket of water to wash them. Headphones weren't waterproof. So I told her thank you for trying to help but also explained why it wasn't a good idea. I told her that the value of those Headphones is equal to this many of her toys and that she wouldn't like it if all of a sudden she couldn't play with them anymore. At 3, she was able to understand that daddy gets paid 100$ an hour. If she destroys a 100$ thing, daddy will have to work an hour longer to pay for it and that's an hour less he gets to spend with us. Gentle parenting doesn't mean that there are no consequences to their actions. It means that you give them natural consequences instead of punishment. \nI would also look into how long your kid was without supervision. It takes no time to drag a line on the wall with a marker but to mimic a whole ass mural on the wall, your kid had time to do it.", "Damn there's a ton of people in here who hopefully are not raising kids. Imagine thinking that telling a 3 year old ANYTHING once is enough to cement a behavior for life. NTA, kids being a kid and you recognize the intent was good, and redirected future attempts to a proper medium", "As a father of a daughter that is a creative, I came to accept things like this. The wall is easily painted later or, if the right paint is used in the first place, it can be easily wiped off. The kid is 3 and needs the ability to explore their creative side. You are NTA.", "This was a 3 year old who was supposedly being watched by paternal grandmother. He was excited to show his dad his present. He had no idea what he was doing would have been \u201cbad\u201d. Mom responded perfectly in the moment. Did anyone chastise grandma for not watching a 3-year old?!?! Bevause if it was extensive enough to be considered vandalism then it was more than a few minutes. Shame on dad and paternal grandmother for putting adult expectations on a toddler!!", "NAH. People are only saying YTA because you didn't immediately reprimand or scold the kid. Nobody's an ass in this situation, except for maybe your mother-in-law for simply letting it happen while your son was under her watch.\n\nA 3-year-old kid saw his mama draw on the walls as a gift. He drew on the walls as a gift. In his mind, he has no reason to see that as a bad thing.\n\nYou told him that he did a good job because what he did wasn't any attempt at being mischievous or disruptive. You told him to use paper next time. You could have gone into more detail of explicitly stating, \"Don't draw on the walls\", but, still. \n\nYour husband is the only one here that seems to have a skewed mindset on the issue. He thinks that a 3-year-old \"vandalized\" his office, as though a 3-year-old understands the concept of vandalism. He didn't get mad at your son or anything, which is the appropriate way to respond to the kid. But he's still upset at you after you suggested solutions (one of which being you *literally painting a mural on his office wall*) and he's still upset because his son didn't get scolded. \n\nYou handled the situation fine, you just could have made it clearer to your son *why* he doesn't get to draw on the walls. Your husband has a skewed look on the situation, but he hasn't done anything that warrants really calling him an asshole. \n\nNAH.", "NTA -- You didn't \"encourage\" him to draw on walls.... you told him to use paper going forward.\n\n\"I told my son good job and that it looked really pretty but he needed to use paper next time instead after he said he made a present for his dad.\"\n\nFor all those saying she's TAH because she \"encouraged\" him -- did you miss this sentence in it's entirety?", "INFO: why tf did your MIL lose sight of him and basically let him draw on the walls when she was supposed to be watching him", "NAH.

Also he did this under the guise of adult supervision of the grandparents. I have a 2 and 3 year old niece and nephew. When they're quiet they're up to no good :'). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't call what he did vandalism either maybe a mistake after all I doubt hubby was a completely angelic 3 year old I bet his mum has stories of his gettings up to... we all do. Toddlers are inquisitive and copy everything, because they're learning about the world around them. So from the kids perspective it could also be a \"well why can't I do this on the wall but mummy can?\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you've suggested it could be turned into a mural or painted over - some stuff will also wipe off so it's really not a biggie.", "you really aren't, you just wanted to teach your kid that he could still draw without it being on the walls. Does he expect for you to start screaming at him or something?", "NTA, sounds like your husband is the 3 year old. Clearly his son had the intentions of making some art for dad, the fact he's mad and locking the office? What a petty little tantrum. OP, keep encouraging your son's creativity, just maybe not on the walls. lol", "The kid is 3.  At 2 and 3 marks on walls will happen.  If your hubby doesn't like it he should take a more active role as a father.  Before anyone starts going off on me saying \"Well, it sounds like you have walls that are covered... blah blah blah.  To me there is encouraging, discouraging, and diverting.  Yes, marks on walls will happen with children.  I've seen some people not care that much about that sort of thing, and some that do.  Kids are sponges, and like to mimic things.  Don't like what they mimic, show them another way!  That's called parenting.  Maybe you shouldn't have said good job but he's a parent too (Supposedly)  He stood silent and said nothing.  So in his eyes your supposed to do it all and talking to his own child is beneath him?  If he didn't like the message being uttered to his son, NEWSFLASH to him, he had the opportunity to say something just like you did!\n\nPersonally speaking in his shoes I would have laughed it off but said \"Hey, Buddy, that's great, but next time how about we do this on a piece of paper that I can get for you and then hang on on my wall???\"  There is a color called gray between black and white for the great debate between free spirits and discipline.\n\nI'm a little disturbed at your husband who is putting more thought into calling your shared child a vandal than chocking it up the learning for a child that is 3.  If he doesn't like it, he can get involved instead of acting like the owner of a business who's wall just got some spray paint art on it.  It's not some random guy tagging his wall, it's his son with crayon (marker, etc).  He's a father, and when your a Dad, there's doing you're job, and that job doesn't come with complaint forms.\n\nNTA.", "this comment section perfectly exemplifies the amount of  people that have grown up on punishment rather than with parents who talk to them and explain stuff. kids will trust you more if you explain to them why certain stuff is the way it is rather than punishing them", "If YTA for finding a middle ground (praise and caution) based on the comments, What does that say about mother-in-law who was watching him?", "But she did, by putting \"good job\" first. Kids only process short sentences, and usually the first few words. He very likely blanked on the paper part of it.  \nNot saying she should have fussed and yelled, but definitely no praise outside of \"This belongs on paper, even though it looks good\". The first part should always be the key you are teaching.\n\n\\-former preschool teacher", "Agree. I feel most of Y T A are non parents. When you have kids you learn these kind of event happen often, and we need to redirect them and teach them a lesson without losing our patience.", "To answer that question it would be helpful to know how much drawing he managed to do before someone noticed. If he had ten minutes to really cover the wall then I agree that MIL should have noticed. But if he only managed a minute or two of scribbling then it's more understandable and MIL might have just been in the bathroom or making lunch or something."]}
