Telling him \u201cgood job\u201d instead of explaining why it\u2019s wrong right off the bat reinforces the bad behavior. I would also be upset if a kid drew all over my office walls.", "This is a really hard one for me to decide quite honestly. I think the more positive approach you took is understandable, but I also think your husband and his irritation towards potentially encouraging it was also valid. \n\nWish there was a no-one-sucks option\n\nEdit: a kind soul reminded me about NAH", "YTA\n\nThe proper response was, \" I know you wanted to help decorate like Daddy, but you can not ever color on walls without permission.\" You didn't have to make a traumatic issue of it or punish, but clearly communicating was in order.\n\nSetting boundaries is part of good parenting. You are supposed to be training the little human to function well in a big human world.", "He\u2019s three and mimicking something he saw his mom do in his unborn sibling\u2019s room. This is super normal behavior that doesn\u2019t warrant getting angry over especially given the clear reason for it. \u201cWow what a beautiful drawing but next time let\u2019s use paper/your easel/etc here, come help me clean this up.\u201d is not in fact bad parenting, it\u2019s good parenting, people just don\u2019t like it because it isn\u2019t fear/consequence based. The only place I can see that you went wrong here is not having your kid help you clean the walls immediately. \n\nNTA though. Not all parenting and discipline requires punishment.\n\nETA: I actually don\u2019t think that your husband is TA either for locking his office door so your son can\u2019t get in, at least temporarily. That\u2019s setting a boundary, which is okay!", "YTA.\n\nI\u2018m sorry, but \"good job\" implies what he\u2018s done is right and absolutely won\u2018t teach your son anything other than further misbehaving. You could\u2019ve explained it to him without enabling it.", "Soft YTA, because it could have been managed better. \n\n I don't think your son's intention was to \"vandalize\".  He saw an adult in his family - a point of reference in his life - doing something and he imitated, believing he was doing a good thing for his dad.  At that age it is normal behavior.\n\nAnyway, the walls in the home office are messed up and this is an inconvenience for your husband, I understand why he's pissed. \n\n But why did MIL, who was supervising the child, do nothing to stop him? \n\n I think you should sit your child down and try to calmly and gently explain to him why he shouldn't do this anymore.  He alone is unable to understand.  If you don't intervene, you'll soon have all the walls in your house messed up.", "YTA.\n\nBet you wouldn't have the same reaction if the kid did this in the nursery, or your bedroom or your living room.", "Good job OP! YTA!", "Kinda. I get where you are coming from. He's only 3 and saw you drawing on a wall then painting it. However, what he did was wrong. What if you go to a friend's home and he does this? Going to tell him \"good job\"?", "The mother in law sounds like the major AH here", "ESH.  Gently.  Vandalizing?  Really?  He doesn't understand the concept.  Dad needs to let this one go.  And you need to make sure kiddo gets permission in the future.\n\nOTOH locking his office door is a great solution, so you let that go.", "YTA\n\nYes, I understand why he did this, and kudos to you and your husband for not losing your tempers! He's three and he didn't understand that drawing on the walls was wrong since *you* are doing it. \n\nBut your husband is right; you shouldn't be *encouraging* this unless you *want* the kid to keep scribbling on the walls, which your husband clearly does *not*.\n\nAnd what's the problem with your husband keeping his office door locked to prevent it?", "YTA. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t teach your son not to do this if you praise him for this, when while I can see where you and your son was coming from as to why he did it, he still should have been told why it\u2019s not a good thing to just randomly scribble on walls.", "NAH\u2026 a 3 year old is not responsible, and is emulating a parent.  This should be used as a teaching moment, have him help paint over it and explain that drawing on walls is only something grownups are allowed to do.  Maybe put some big paper on the wall and tell him it\u2019s ok to draw on that.  But in the moment I think what you did was ok.  No need to completely break the kids heart!", "YTA for praising him, unless you have 0 problems with him randomly scribbling on any wall he feels like scribbling on. \n\nAlthough, \u2018vandalizing\u2019 is a bit strong, considering his age and the fact that he\u2019s watching you paint a mural.", "YTA\n\nIt'a a OFFICE!\n\nHe should draw at your bedroom or livingroom or maybe \ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32 his own room\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32, but that's not that funny. \nDaddy can take it.", "All I can picture is an old guy shaking his fist at a Banksy while screaming \"IT'S NOT ART! IT'S VANDALISM!!\"", "Yta but softly, you did not have bad intentions. What you could have said is :\n\n\"Mommy does it in the nursery with special tools but she also has permission from herself and daddy ~~and the baby~~ to do it. I know you wanted to make daddy a surprise but you did not have our permission. We are not mad but dont do it again, next time use a paper and we will be very happy! Say sorry to dada now!\"", "NAH but you picked the wrong wording. Saying \"good job,\" implies that he did the right thing. And stating to use paper next time is probably confusing, because he doesn't know why what he did is different than the mural. \n\n\nYou can acknowledge that the intent and picture were nice, while still saying the action (\"job\") wasn't. \n\n\nYou can tell him the drawing was nice, while also telling him that he can't draw on the walls or anything but paper, without Mommy or Daddy being there and asking their permission.  \n\n\nAnd there is absolutely nothing wrong with your husband now locking his office. \n\n\nWas he never told that he can't go into Daddy's office? Because even if the intent was nice, if he's not supposed to be in the office, that should be talked about, too.", "NAH, but I'm a (part time business) creative person so I sympathize with encouraging that. I'd also be pretty irritated if a three year old was in my home office messing around at all, much less wrecking the walls, so I sympathize with your husband. \n\nI also think its good that he spoke to you privately about it afterwards so as not to disagree in front of your son.", "YTA - you rewarded him for bad behavior, which will encourage him to do it again.", "NAH. As a mother I admire the way you handled the situation. However, I also feel for your husband. That's his workspace. It's not a bad thing to need your own space.", "Nah\n\nLook, your lo saw parent paint on walls as a present for unborn sibling.  Your lo mimicked the action for a present for dad.  You praised the art AND told him to use paper next time.  That is good parenting based on the age and situation.\n\nI don\u2019t blame your husband for being upset though and locking his office.  It is his personal space and he can determine who he wants in it.  \n\nJust reiterate with your son that only in special circumstances should art be done on the wall, but he needs to ask you or your husband.  Otherwise, art is best done on paper.", "YTA because the phrasing \"good job\" will confuse your child. That is praising him for doing an action we don't want. He's only little and will misunderstand.\n\nSome bad parents make the mistake of conflating \"wrong actions\" with \"being a bad person,\" i.e. \"my child broke a vase accidentally so they are bad and inconsiderate.\" Other parents want to avoid this mistake of making their child feel like a bad person, so they tell their child their actions were good even when they weren't. This is you. However, the ideal parent can teach their child that a good person can still make mistakes, and that it's okay when that happens. You don't have to tell him that his actions were good when they weren't, but you also don't blame him or punish him for an honest mistake.\n\nKeep it simple. \"We don't draw on walls without permission, but you can draw a nice picture for daddy on the paper. Mommy had permission to draw on the walls before so that's why she was allowed. It's nice to give people presents, and it's nice that you wanted to give a present to daddy, but in future, give him presents on paper.\" You can even help him do a drawing on paper to give to his dad to reinforce the correct behavior.", "It\u2019s our job as parents to let kids know what is and isn\u2019t appropriate behavior. Telling your son \u201cgood job\u201d is reinforcing drawing on walls. You should have left out the good job entirely. Doesn\u2019t have to be punitive, because his intentions were good, but it is your job to let him know in no uncertain terms that the behavior wasn\u2019t appropriate. \u201cOh no! I see that you wanted to make a pretty mural for Daddy, but we do NOT draw on walls! We ONLY draw on paper.\u201d Very soft YTA.", "Devil's advocate,   if your son goes to a friend or relatives house and scribbles on the wall,  would you say 'good job?'   Or would you groan at the bill you are going to have to pay to repaint?", "Soft YTA because \u201cgood job\u201d probably wasn\u2019t the best approach. He needs to learn that randomly coloring on walls is not an acceptable approach or you\u2019re going to have to do a lot of repainting in the next little while. You need to explain that daddy didn\u2019t want his walls redone in the office and that he needs to get permission before redoing walls in the future, even if he\u2019s doing it to say I love you. \nYou also have a dangerous combination in your house at this point. You are past the point where you should have gathered all the permanent markers in the house and thrown them away to be replaced with washable markers only. Discuss it with him and have him try to scrub the walls he colored on so he understands how serious it is. Then move on and help him make it up to his dad.", "My 3 yr old drew inside my kitchen cabinets with permanent marker. My husband wasn\u2019t happy about at the time. He is 26 now. Now my husband won\u2019t let me change out the cabinets. He has gotten very sentimental over the \u201cdamage\u201d the kids did to the house. It will eventually become one of those wholesome family memories. Buy some art supplies for your budding artist. NTA.", "Very Very mild YTA. \n\nNot for giving your husband a good idea in my book, but for not telling your son that painting on walls without permission is not a good idea. \n\nYou told him what he did was a good job and I can commend that. \n\nBut I think you should let him know that painting someones wall without asking is not nice. Don't scold him or anything. Just explain for a child. \n\nIt will happen again, believe me and that is fine. But if you always tell him that painting on a wall is not as good as painting on paper, because you can hang it on your fridge or something that way will make him understand and he will stop eventually. \n\nMaybe you repaint the wall of your husbands office together with your son. Let him make the fist few lines and then you build from there. He will love to see what comes from 'his' drawing. \n\nAnd tell your husband to cool it. It's a freaking wall not a Picasso with crayons on the surface...", "Yta\n\nScribbling on walls isn't a 'good job'. \n\nWhat you were doing and what he did are completely different..  He's a child, so his scope for rational thinking is limited.  As a parent you job is to widen his knowledge base, so be comes more rational over time.  If you fail to do that he will grow up with the incorrect idea that everything he's done is great, fine.  Hell be confused and resentful when he starts to be told its not.", "YTA. Stop this behavior now! You know he was wrong and instead of correcting you give an excuse and make it sound like it\u2019s adorable!", "YTA\n\nHey, if you want a kid that will scribble all over your walls so you have to constantly repaint them, more power to you. But this is your husband's office. HIS space. The kid shouldn't have even been in there. I'd be pissed at MIL for allowing the kid to do it in the first place!\n\nYou don't have to be a jerk to set limits with your kids.", "NTA and I really don\u2019t understand all the others saying you are. If you follow gentle parenting practices then what you did was exactly right. You were kind to your child while still telling them what they did was wrong and what they should do the next time. \n\nYour child is 3, and only trying to do something nice. What do these people want you to do? Scream and beat him? Then they\u2019d all be vilifying you and saying you really are an A.", "YTA", "YTA. What's wrong with you? Will you be saying good job if he do the same to a stranger car, to any public space? There's a big difference between scribbling on wall because you're actually wanting it and doing it on another room where it's not wanted. Like, do we really need to explain this?", "I'm kinda surprised at the consensus here. I am also a parent to a 3 year old little boy. I would say NTA. He learned from you that you were doing a good positive thing by painting his new little soon to be sibling's room. Also that it was a gift to them because you love them. He loves his Dad so he wanted to do the same thing. He's 3. He isn't going to connect the dots that it's ok in 1 room and not the other. He was really happy and excited about showing you guys his work. It would have broken his spirit a little if you reacted negatively. I think you did a good job showing him that you appreciate his efforts to show his love for his Dad and letting him know that next time it's best he draws on paper instead of the walls.", "YTA, it's cute and your husband used too strong a word but it's the wall of an office and both you and MIL let it happen.", "Eh yeah YTA. I know you want to support your son\u2019s creativity, but your job is to be a parent, and part of being a parent is discipline.", "YTA - You sound like one of those insufferable new age parents who don\u2019t believe in saying the word \u201cno\u201d to a child.", "NTA you said good job to acknowledge his efforts he wanted to make a mural like you for his dad. It\u2019s sweet. But you also corrected the action by telling him he has to use paper. You didn\u2019t just say good job and go on about your day.", "NTA\n\nHe should be asking his mom why she let the kid 'vandalise' his office instead of watching him.", "YTA. Why are so many Here acting as If three year olds are braindead idiots, who are not capable to understand even the Most simple things and because of that it's useless to teach them anyway? Continue to parent your son Like that, and He will be that child that gets in everyone's nerves because their parents never bothered to teach them basic manners.\n\nAnd it's super effed up, that you let your kid do damage to your husband's personal space, which isn't your space, and give him praise Afterwards.l, especially since your husband is upset because of this", "When my daughter was 3, she drew a picture of my grandparents on the wall of her bedroom. It was really good. I knew she'd be an artist right then. So, I did not punish her. I did buy her an art set and paper to draw on. She os an artist now. NTA.", "Parenting advice is hit or miss on this sub. Irregardless, in my actual opinion, Dad standing to the side without any reaction, therefore by default leaving it up to you, THEN criticizing you for your reaction afterwards, is an Asshole move on his part. NTA.", "NTA, but you'll need to explain why it's ok for you to do it in one room but not him.", "NTA. It was from a good place and was a genuine misunderstanding. Sit him down and explain gently why you don't usually use walls, help him make a paper drawing for his dad, and invite him to help clean the walls.\n\nYelling at him for what was intended as a loving gift would have been an AH move, and any commenters who encourage that kind of reaction sound like terrible parents.", "I\u2019m going to have to go with NTA simply because MIL (husband\u2019s mom!!!) was supposed to be watching him when he created the mural.

Which, I am sure you have done.  \n\nPeople just don't understand how it is to live with artists and toddlers.", "NTA \n\nYou were praising the art a 3 year old who thought he was doing something really nice for his father. This wasn\u2019t a 3 year old doing something to test boundaries, as a 3 year old is wont to do. \n\nThen you redirected him. You told him that next time he needs to color only on paper. You did this calmly, which is a good way to actually teach your child.\n\nWhat did your husband want you to do, scream and spank the poor kid? He honestly didn\u2019t realize what he did was wrong and thought he was doing something sweet.", "You told him to do it on paper next time.

I'm 100000% against punishment, yelling and screaming at kids BUT that doesn't mean that you shouldn't parent him. Instead of saying 'good job' you should have explained to him why is that wrong and let him help you fix it.

First off, the OP did the right thing by saying to the child, \"Good job\". And also adding that next time we do that on paper. The child was only doing what he saw his parent do. Children learn by seeing. Anyway, the next step in teaching is to direct the child to the more acceptable alternative which is paper. The mother wasn't praising the child to encourage the continued coloring on the walls. She was merely letting the child know that she acknowledged the show of love and then proceeded to guide the child correctly.\n\nWhen you scold a child in a situation like the one mentioned, you can scar the child for life.

I'm just saying that the kid shouldn't be punished at all.\n\nRe: husband's reaction to the whole situation, I think OP's exact phrasing is a little silly to focus on anyway, considering dad was in so much shock that he didn't say anything at all. So I'm sure she was shocked too and just finally said something. So the husband being upset with her even after she offered multiple ways to fix the problem isn't fair, imo", "OP didn\u2019t say \u201cgood job\u201d to their son for specifically scribbling on the walls though, she said \u201cgood job\u201d (for being artistic) and redirected his creativity to paper only. \n\nHe\u2019s 3 years old, he has seen his mother painting a wall and he replicated that with no ill intent. OP responded by encouraging his creativity whilst also explaining that he needs to use paper instead.", "Some of the early comments were saying that the kid should be punished, is why I said it at all. I'm well aware that the dad didn't yell and isn't asking the kid to be grounded or whatever. \n\nIt isn't confusing to say \"hey this is a really nice thing you tried to do, but here's why we don't do that...\" as long as you explain it clearly.", "Sorry, that was just me talking, I didn't think you'd judged anyone.\n\nHave a good day.", "Lmao this is what happens when you post a parenting related question to this sub like you said. I\u2019m seriously laughing at the asinine responses here. All children who have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. No shame, I used to be like that too, but Atleast I didn\u2019t have a platform to show how dumb I was.", "She said \"good job, use paper next time\". Nothing in her explanation told the 3 year old that drawing on walls is bad.", "Dismissive would have been not correcting the behavior, and just being like \"ah it's fine, don't make a big deal of it!\" \n\nShe:\n\n1) Said don't do that again.\n\n2) Offered a solution (we'll have it painted, nothing is ruined).\n\nThere is no reason to reprimand a confused toddler anymore than that. The behavior is corrected for the future (hence, \"don't do that again, use paper next time\") and the walls will be fixed. OP's husband isn't wrong to be irritated with the damage, but there's no use crying over spilt milk. He didn't destroy the walls; he scribbled on them. Magic eraser might even be able to fix them without paint. Even so, a quick paint job is also not something to cry over. I'm genuinely curious what other people are wanting from OP? Yell at their kid and tell them their drawing sucked??", "Well what the fuck is she supposed to do anyway? Spank him? Punish him for something that the kid meant as a gift and can be easily fixed? Lol", "Ahhh yes. And then the cute little muchnkin. Decides that priceless painting at the museum would look better with sharpie on it. Because mommy always let him cor wherever he wants and praised him for it.", "Some things are okay for adults to do, but not for kids. Using the stove alone, starting a fire in the fireplace, swimming alone in the pool, etc. Children living in the house typically live under rules made by adults. \n\nIf you want your kids to exist on equal standing, then she should have asked him whether he was okay with the mural she was painting, perhaps at a family meeting. They should consult him when choosing a car, planning meals, considering a move, etc. in that case. Why should they get any more say than he does?", "All the husband did he say he's upset for the \"good job\" comment and start looking his office. If OP expressed other things to the son, that stuff should have been there. But OP seems to be taking the locking the office as a problem, like a punishment. \n\n\nSaying to use paper is a good start, there needs to be more conversation. \n\n\n\"Good job\" is still not the best choice of words. It seems like her husband didn't want to say anything at the time because he wanted to talk to his wife first, and she's just defending her phrasing.", "And you think a 3 year old will make that distinction? No, the 3 year old will take that as encouragement.", "Children can't differentiate linguistically like that, not at 3 years old. She is confusing the child and she should have never said 'good job'. Communication should be extremely clear and direct with children.", "Exactly. But \"good job\" is not \"hey this is a really nice thing you tried to do, but here's why we don't do that...\". \"Good job\" is literally \"what you did was good.\" That is not the message we are trying to convey. \n\nThe phrases you keep suggesting are fine. I agree that \"hey this is a really nice thing you tried to do, but here's why we don't do that...\" is fine. But \"good job\" is not appropriate.", "Same same, no shame at all, it's an important part of growing", "She can 1) NOT praise him.  2) take away his crayons for a short period of time.  3) explain why he\u2019s losing the crayons.  Those would be age appropriate ways of teaching him not to draw on walls.", "The parents should use clear language that says we shouldn't be doing this. That's all.", "You can say \u201cwow that is a pretty picture! But it\u2019s on the wall, and without mom or dad\u2019s help we need to make sure our crayons only color on paper. We will have to fix this, how about after we find a solution you can make dad a picture on paper for his office?\u201d\n\nYTA, OP\n\nEdited: I don\u2019t think hiring someone to paint is really an \u201ceasy fix\u201d either. Yeah it\u2019s just paint but it\u2019s time and/or money. I am constantly cleaning up messes and I won\u2019t pretend it doesn\u2019t get old", ">Well what the fuck is she supposed to do anyway? Spank him? \n\nIs that the only other option?\n\n>Punish him for something that the kid meant as a gift and can be easily fixed? Lol\n\nGood intentions are essentially irrelevant sadly. The action itself is far more important. Teaching children this is one of the many aspects of parenting.", "Be firm and say we don\u2019t color on walls. You know, be a parent.", "The first reaction a parent has leaves the most impression on a child. So what she was supposed to do is first tell the kid that this was wrong. Then explain that as nice as the painting was, it's not the place. And let him \"help\" in cleaning.", "Make it clear that scribbling on walls without asking is not acceptable? Pretty much anything other than \u201cgood job\u201d. Relax lmao", "i mean, when i was a kid drawing on the walls, i got grounded with a magic eraser and told i could be ungrounded when it was clean. that got the message across loud and clear to me. this kids still a little young so i might just have him \u201chelp\u201d scrub the walls so he at least he understand that after you make a mess, you clean it up", "Sit down and explain to the child that you only draw on paper at the table/desk. Then take away their drawing privileges for the day. Then you keep an eye on them when they are coloring the next few times and redirect them when they start eyeing the walls. That's how you parent your child. Not praise.them for doing something they aren't supposed to.", "You know that discipline isn\u2019t the only way to modify a toddler\u2019s behaviour, right?\n\nRedirecting creativity is much more effective than harshly disciplining unintentionally troublesome behaviour.", "Yes, obviously. I never implied that a toddler was capable of forming that connection on their own. Their son saw OP painting, he mimicked her behaviours and she encouraged his creativity whilst also explaining that he needed to use paper next time. Both OP and her husband need to reaffirm this by continually encouraging his use of appropriate art mediums.", "I just think getting hung up on the phrasing is defeating the purpose though. The husband was so shocked that he didn't say anything. So OP had to step in and react. Maybe it wasn't the best phrasing, but she was shocked too I'm sure. And the husband is still upset with her for the exact phrasing even after the kid's misconception has been corrected and she's offered multiple ways to fix the problem. I just can't see her as the AH here", "She can, but also that just feels like an overreaction to what is the kid mimicking something he saw her do as a nice gesture to his dad. \n\nI remember as a kid trying to do nice stuff for my family members and how crushed I was once when I messed up and got yelled at.\n\nJust having a talk with him right now is enough. If he does it again then yeah, sure, take away his crayons. But punishing a 3 year old for trying to do something nice is bad parenting IMO.", "That\u2019s what OP did though? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nShe said good job and then let\u2019s make sure we draw on paper next time. \n\nAlso, from fact that OP is painting her own mural I get the feeling she\u2019s quite comfortable with paint and can probably fix the mistake with ease?", "She said she told the kid not to do it again and explained to paint on paper next time. There\u2019s nothing wrong with acknowledging the kid\u2019s efforts to do something nice for his dad with \u201cgood job\u201d IMO", "Except they do color on walls, together, all the time while making the mural. \n\nEverything the kid did was correct *except* the location. He did something nice for dad and created art. Instead of freaking out about the wall, OP focused on the art and showed her kid where to do it. So the kid doesn't associate his art or his gift with a negative response.", "Which she said she told him afterwards so\u2026 what\u2019s the issue? You can say \u201cgood job\u201d and also \u201clet\u2019s not do it again\u201d the two are not mutually exclusive.", "And when did I mention anything about punishment or anything even close? You just pulled that outta your ass. I'm saying don't exclaim \"good job\" if it's not a good behaviour. Also, saying that discipline isn't the only way is correct, because discipline can be considered an umbrella of actions to have your toddler behave correctly. But discipline IS necessary, believe it or not. Maybe you view discipline as abuse and beatings and such but when I say discipline I could mean simply getting your kid into positive habits through explanation and suggestions, for example.", "The problem is that as a small child, he understands \"good job\" as \"I should repeat this behavior.\" The phrasing does matter.", "It's kind of a mixed message though isn't it. Don't do this again, but what you did was good. Not easy for a 3 year old to navigate the nuance. \n\nI know adults that would struggle with this.", "With a 3 year old? No, you can\u2019t tell them good job when they do something wrong. Because that will confuse them when you then tell them not to do it.", "I don\u2019t view discipline as abuse, \u201cyou just pulled that outta your ass\u201d. From the limited information provided, we know that OP said \u201cgood job\u201d whilst also explaining that their son needed to use paper next time. She acknowledged his creativity, but also explained that it needs to be confined to an appropriate canvas.", "Human life? Having nuance? Damn, that\u2019s crazy.", "What I was saying is you made an assumption of a harsh discipline being suggested without any implications for that. She should not have encouraged it at all, that is the point. The art may be great, it could've been the next big thing, but when you say \"good job\" the kid can easily read that as being allowed to do it again even if you follow up with a discouraging statement. Equally they could do it anyway and then question why it's wrong if it's good, also. Encouraging your kid is important but when it's the moment for it. When you're trying to make a point to your kid that something is bad you don't give positive encouragement as that's counterproductive to what you're trying to tell the kid."]}
