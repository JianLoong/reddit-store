From the sound of it you sound perfect for a HOA because your greedy and a AH .", "No, you won\u2019t.", "Bad assumptions get made about you when you act like this much of an AH.", "As far as I can understand it, he\u2019s wanting her to continue paying the same amount that she normally contributes to expenses, which would include her half of the $400 HOA fee. But since there currently is no HOA fee, wife\u2019s argument is that she shouldn\u2019t have to contribute that $200 because that\u2019s basically just her giving him $200 for no reason.\n\nGranted, OP isn\u2019t very good at phrasing any of this. He\u2019s acting like he\u2019s getting *paid*, but it seems that he\u2019s expecting to contribute a total of $400 less to the monthly costs, so basically saving himself an extra $200 on what he *should* be contributing to the mortgage. Because now wife\u2019s $200 HOA fee can cover that.\n\nBasically, say they each pay $800 a month. $200 to the HOA fee and $600 to mortgage. They *should* both just be paying $600/month to those expenses now, but OP wants to pay $400 and have wife continue paying $800.", "Yeah, so that\u2019s why I think rather than having the fee waived. I will request that a check is cut like it\u2019s a part-time job to avoid this issue.", "If he treats his wife this way, imagine what it must be like to co-parent with this guy\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his ex has to give him receipts of every penny she spends on their child so he doesn\u2019t accidentally pay her to much child support\u2026 and if he generously has the kid a couple days, she can minus that from her cheque too!", "There is another vacancy on the board. I asked her to join so we\u2019d get even more. It\u2019s a lot of work. She said no. She must hate me to priories  her leisure time over helping the family.", "We don\u2019t keep score like that. If you want to drill down details I am older than her. Make more money then her. And have a kid I take care of from a previous relationship. My wife is incredibly helpful to me and is a great stepmom. I could of course justify giving her half my paycheck differential. There is no end. All I am saying is why can\u2019t I do some extra side work and pocket it?", "Yeah, no. That\u2019s not how it works. The fees are not for *individuals.* She isn\u2019t paying HOA fees. That fee, *for their unit* is waived. If she were on the board as well, they can\u2019t, like, double-waive the fee. OP is essentially demanding that he be able to pocket $200 of what he\u2019d normally contribute to the mortgage, because he wants his wife to keep paying the same amount she would pay if they still had the HOA fee.", " Because he is a butthole lol.", "Honestly, it sounds like he is going to fit in splendidly in the HOA.", "I\u2019m waiting to hear how OP explains the need for the check. \u201cI don\u2019t want my wife to benefit from the HOA fee being waived, so I\u2019m going to need you to write me a personal check.\u201d\n\nEdit-typo", "Yeah, I feel like this guy is not someone I\u2019d actually want to deal with on the HOA. He literally cannot amicably solve a 400 dollar problem with his wife. He should not be in charge of making decision for anyones home.", "It\u2019s just so strange that you are so against your wife saving some money. Why does her benefiting from this upset you so much? You still save money from the fee being waived yet you are just not willing to let her benefit in anyway. I would not want to be in a marriage if my wife was this upset about helping me to the point she would actually hurt herself as well. You really need to rethink your marriage", "Yeah, that will make you less of an asshole \ud83d\ude43", "You want the HOA to write you a check?", "I hope your wife sees your true colors and runs.

Your household will be worse off as your wife will have less money. It\u2019s embarrassing how you don\u2019t see this. Your poor wife. I\u2019m sure she would laugh if it wasn\u2019t so depressing. YTA and you are so selfish there is no hope for you.", "This is some next level petty. You are perfect for the Board of an HOA.", "HAHAHA you think the Board is going to cut you a check? Guarantee there are by laws that would prohibit - I sit on a few community boards and all are volunteer positions and 90% of the time, HOA boards are prohibited from providing a monetary salary/wage to members because it will effect their tax status.\n\nSo not only are you an inconsiderate AH of a husband, but not a very bright one either.", "So how about the fact that you have less tkme for her or at home because you are working for the hoa? Did you do chores in that time that your wife has to do now? Spend time together relaxing that she now has to spend alone? She is paying a price for you working for the hoa. How wkll you compensate her for that", "I hope you are denied. This is ridiculous. If I was your wife, I would stop paying the fee either way :) So if it is waived no worries, but if you insist on paying it, getting it returned via check so you can pocket all the money, that is technically theft and fraud and I hope your wife refuses to pay her share of the fees for the length of time you are serving on the board. You will either be forced to pay the full amount or take the waiver of the fee. Personally, I hope your wife leaves you because you are a horrible, greedy person.", "Is this something an HOA can actually do? I understand waiving fees, but writing checks is different.", "You REALLY don't want to share with your wife do you? Like the gymnastics you're going through to not share shows that you're a selfish jerk who holds money in higher regard than your partner.\n\nYTA.", "How would you get more??? Do you own more than one unit? It\u2019s a credit and they can\u2019t credit you more than your cost.", "Honestly? Who would want to be with you if this is your general attitude towards the person you're supposed to love? I have been involved with an HOA and you're being super dramatic about how much work it is. You're acting like you're doing back breaking labor.", "How would you get more??? The bill is already waived!", "I mean if she hates you it\u2019s because the idea of your wife benefiting from your volunteer position seems to be the worst thing you can imagine\u2026.and also, you\u2019re making her pay 50% of expenses even though you\u2019ve clearly stated you make more money than her. Do you want to make sure she has less money than you? Is this a control thing so she can\u2019t leave? Otherwise I don\u2019t get it at all.", "She doesn't want to do that specific job, so therefore she hates you? That's insane, not to mention emotionally abusive. So she'd work to support the household if she really loved you, but it's not fair for your work to support the whole household? Wanting money all to yourself isn't selfish? Doesn't show contempt for your partner?", "But you are keeping score here. But she is telling you that she doesn\u2019t appreciate you making her pay more in this instance. To her (and for most of us), this is telling her that your time needs to be paid, if not by the HOA well then her! \n\nIt\u2019s great that your 50/50 worked up to now, but life has a funny way of creeping up with little hurdles. Right now, this isn\u2019t the hill you are making it and you are protecting your cash flow over your relationship. She is telling you that this will affect her view of you. This will impact your marriage and might be the hill you die on. \n\nFood for thought.", "Do you pay her to be a step mom. That\u2019s a voluntary role she took on and she doesn\u2019t have to do anything at all for your kid, she doesn\u2019t even have to let your kid come visit because when your kid is there, that\u2019s extra utilities being used. And if one of the rooms in your house is reserved for your kid, then splitting the bills 50/50 is not fair to her because one of the bedrooms belongs to only YOUR child. She doesn\u2019t have to subsidize your child, yet she does, she volunteers for it and gets no benefits. You do get benefits from it. Difference is with the HOA fee waived, you both could benefit.", "That makes it worse. If you make more than her, you should be paying a greater percentage of bills anyway, not split 50/50.\n\nBut you're definitely TA.\n\nYTA.", "That is exactly what you\u2019re doing - keeping score and trying to rip off your wife for $2400 per year", "Because it is a volunteer position, no one should be paying you to do it, especially just your wife.", "And well if it\u2019s your kid, by your logic, she shouldn\u2019t help you with anything.", "If you make more money, you should split the costs proportionally and not 50/50.", "> All I am saying is why can\u2019t I do some extra side work and pocket it?\n\nYou can. You pay $200 of HOA fees. You don\u2019t need to pay that now, due to your side work. So you\u2019re pocketing your $200 a month. And then there\u2019s an added bonus that you get to relieve your wife of some of her financial burden, too!\n\nHowever, I understand that this isn\u2019t really a fair way of doing it. It isn\u2019t right that one partner gets a better deal then the other.\n\nSo maybe it\u2019s time to split your finances fairly, based on what you earn, instead of 50/50 \ud83d\ude43\n\nAlso, are you ever gonna get back to us about the division of labour in the household?", "How is \"you owe me $200 because the HOA won't pay it to me directly\" not keeping score?", "You\u2019re literally keeping score lol wtf are you talking about YTA\n\nETA it\u2019s not side work, you\u2019re not being compensated. It\u2019s a fee that is no longer there that you somehow think your wife now has to pay you directly?", "You are keeping score like that. You are doing extra work that removes this fee. She does extra work in the household so that you don\u2019t have to pay those costs. Even 8 hours a month of caring for your child would be $200+ if it was a babysitter. \n\nYou are not seeing the value in what she contributes to the household, because the direct monetary cost isn\u2019t attached to it for you. \nLaundry service, cooking, cleaning, child care. Those all would have costs to you if she wasn\u2019t doing them. If not money, than time. \nWhen you do all this HOA board stuff, that takes up some of your time, are you going to continue putting in the same towards the running of the household when you have lost some of your available time for this?", "Because you are asking her to pay you to do a volunteer position", "As someone who served six years on a co-op board for absolutely nothing, it's very hard for me to feel the \"but the fruits of my labour!\" argument.", "He keeps saying this but them cutting him a paycheck would have tax implication for them, instead of waiving the fee.

It\u2019s the Board. It\u2019s an incentive to serve a very difficult job.", "seriously this dude's biggest problem is that he just can't understand what the difference between a waived fee and a salary is", "I was just coming to say this - he is \"keeping score \\[EXACTLY\\] like that.", "EXACTLY what I thought. Poor woman to be married to a guy like this!", "I always thought the fruit was a nicer community for everyone (board included).", "It\u2019s not that\u2019s why in another post I recommended the wife divorce and find a roommate.
