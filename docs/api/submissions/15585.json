It was somewhat crowded and there were a lot of families with young children there, which is to be expected at a zoo, of course.\n\nWe were eating lunch in an outdoor area with a lot of tables. When we first sat down, two little girls (probably between 4-5 years old) were chasing each other around the tables and would sprint right past ours on their circuit. That was annoying, but harmless, so I didn\u2019t do anything. However, their dad joined in after several minutes and began to play tag with the kids as we were eating. This got the kids excited, and they started to scream as they ran around. I let it go for a few minutes, but it kept going, and the kids continued to scream at full volume, making it impossible to have a conversation. \n\nFinally, the dad made eye contact with me as I looked over at them. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a bit loud, no?\u201d To which the dad responded with an annoyed look and said, \u201cThey\u2019re kids, come on.\u201d I told him that it didn\u2019t matter and that the fact that they\u2019re kids doesn\u2019t mean they can disrupt everyone else. The dude rolled his eyes at me and repeated what he\u2019d said before, but gathered the kids and sat them down. The kids played much more quietly after that.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks that it was an AH move for me to say something. She says that it\u2019s a zoo, so we should expect to be annoyed by kids left and right (neither of us are particularly fond of children and she was definitely frustrated by the screams as well). I think that despite that, a parent encouraging or enabling their kid to scream at the top of their lungs while other people are eating is rude. A baby crying or a toddler throwing a tantrum might be annoying, but I accept that as inevitable and wouldn\u2019t ask a parent to shut their kid up in those situations. Or, if we were at a park or a Chuck-E-Cheese or something, I\u2019d let it go, because those are indeed places where it\u2019s more appropriate for kids to run wild. But we were in a communal lunch area and the dad was egging them on.\n\nMy girlfriend still thinks I\u2019m the AH in this situation. Do you?\n\nEDIT: it may be important to mention that this zoo has a fairly large section solely designated as a child play area. There is a ton of playground equipment, sandboxes, interactive exhibits, and indeed tables for families to eat lunch while their kids run around and go crazy. We were nowhere near that area and were at a cluster of tables between a few food stands. I wouldn\u2019t have said a word if we were by the play area, but we weren\u2019t.", "created_utc": 1682356770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xppj7/aita_for_asking_a_dad_to_quiet_his_kids/", "score": 516, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yelling and any kind of behavior with the potential to scare or otherwise disturb the animals has been a no-no at every single zoo I\u2019ve visited and I\u2019ve seen children and adults be asked to leave over it.", "NTA - the kids aren\u2019t the problem, the adult man engaging in weird chase games amongst other people eating is bizarre.  A friend had a husband like this.  He legit did not care about anything other than himself or his kids in any public place - he was so selfish.  The kids don\u2019t know better but that dad should.", "NTA. You might have been at a zoo, but that doesn't make it okay for kids to scream at the top of their lungs.", "NTA. Your GF is 100% wrong.\n\nYou have a valid point; \"the fact that they're kids doesn't mean they can disrupt everyone else.\" YES. People say things like \"Come on, it's kids,\" as if it's inevitable that kids will be noisy and there's nothing you can do to stop it. NO. Kids can be taught to not be so noisy. And if they do get carried away, the parent can step in and stop it. Not in this case of course as the father was encouraging it.\n\nAnd, the way you expressed yr feelings was fine. You didn't go over to the table and confront the father. You happened to look at each other, and all you said was one sentence. It seems that if that hadn't happened, you would've said nothing. So it was pretty non-confrontational.", "NTA - They are kids but he's not. And just because they're kids doesn't mean they can continually scream around a lunch area where people are trying to relax. Zoos aren't playgrounds. And it seems you were polite about it.", "NAH. I think you are correct to have said something, which, by the way, was pretty innocuous compared to what some people might have done. The dad also had a pretty good reaction to roll his eyes and then stop the tomfoolery. Basically he heard what you meant and toned it down knowing it was bothering people. If he hadn't, well then maybe he's the asshole. If you had made a scene, well then you're the asshole. But, I think you both behaved acceptably in this situation.  As a father of a 2 year old, we want our kids to have fun. Sometimes it can get obnoxious in public. If it's bothering nonone, no big deal, but if you're aware that you're actions are disturbing, cut it out. Good for both of you.", "I personally don't see this as any different than allowing your kids to run around screaming inside a McDonald's or anywhere else.\n\nThey're at the play structure, like what my zoo has? All the power to you, run, scream, jump, laugh. In the eating area, honestly I take my kids there all the time, no one is running around like this.\n\nGuaranteed other people were thinking about it, you just had the balls to say it.\n\nNTA.", "Nope, NTA\n\nRunning between tables should not be done. Safety first! Then, to scream as you are running between tables disrupts the entire eating area.  NTA.", "NTA. Kids who are taught it's okay to scream drive me nuts. You only scream if you're hurt or a stranger is dragging you to a car.", "NTA, I love kids, I have 2 and am an early years teacher so choose to spend a lot of my time with them and really can cope with almost everything they do. But high pitched screaming really does go through me. \n\nThe Dad could have asked them to be quieter without stopping their play. As you say it was a public place and kids need to learn to be respectful of those around them. Also, in a zoo, I\u2019d be concerned about the nearby animals who could be upset by the noise. You can\u2019t expect kids to be silent but they can learn to limit the noise.", "Reading just the title I was fully expecting to call you the AH but honestly, NTA. It\u2019s not too much to ask that kids now be running around tables where people are eating. God help the parents of the kids who knock my absurdly priced zoo food and drinks over.", "NTA it doesn't really matter to me where it even was in general because you were sitting in a designated eating area. Like, just because it's in a zoo doesn't mean that it's appropriate behavior for the area meant for people to sit and eat.", "NTA, as long as you bought it amicably and weren\u2019t scaring anybody. If it was really that loud that nobody could talk then it\u2019s probably excessive.", "NTA and I\u2019ll tell you why: my son is hearing impaired. He wears hearing aids, and honestly it\u2019s a battle to get him to wear them. Because hearing is not necessarily a comfortable thing. He does not like loud noises, and if someone is screaming, he will discreetly turn off the hearing aids.\n\nIf a child is screaming in fear or in pain, it is one thing. I can discuss it with him and we can agree that it is a necessary noise that is to be accepted. \n\nHowever, screaming because it is \u2018fun\u2019 is something that my son will never accept. Because he is the one dealing with the headaches and tinnitus afterwards.\n\nMy son is not the only child or the only person in the world dealing with this kind of problem. What if there were a blind person where you were sitting? What if there was a neurodivergent person there? Nobody enjoys children running about and screaming! However it may disturb much more than it being a passing nuisance.\n\nSo - it is not \u2018necessary\u2019 or \u2018part of being a child\u2019 to be allowed to scream one\u2019s head off. Part of the journey from childhood to adulthood is also to acknowledge that there are other people in the world, that these people matter and that they may not like the noise one is making.\n\nAlso: it is extremely annoying to have kids run around one when one is trying to eat. Children can understand this! And I say this as a mother of two children whom I never allow to bother other people more than absolutely necessary!", "NTA.  The zoo isn\u2019t just for kids, it\u2019s for everyone.  It just wasn\u2019t the right place to fool around.  Maybe at the playground or an open area in the zoo, it\u2019s expected.  I try to go to the zoo when school is in session to avoid this very thing.", "Your girlfriend is wrong. \n\nThe outdoor area was an accepted lunch spot. Not only did the guy not rein in his kids from disturbing people who were eating, he incited them to make MORE noise. \n\nYou were well within your rights to mention the distraction in a civil manner. \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm sorry but the general expectation is that zoos are for kids, and this is especially true on the weekend. If the kids were screaming and disturbing some animal, I'd probably have a different take, but in the lunch area that's precisely where they can get some energy out. You probably easily could have moved tables, no? I get that it's not like society has to accept any and all behavior from children, but I dunno, based on your description this seems like pretty standard and innocuous family weekend zoo behavior.", "High pitched screaming could also upset the animals in the zoo. Definitely NTA. I think you handled the situation fine.", "YTA You should have excepted loud kids at an attraction known to appeal to children", "Nta they were perfectly fine playing until they started to scream.", "As a parent myself, NTA. Personally, I would never encourage my daughter to scream, at home, or in public unless it was for emergencies only. Like you said, crying babies and tantrums are inevitable - in this situation, the parent did the wrong thing and should not have encouraged the running between tables (safety hazard) or the screaming in an eating area.", "NTA I have 2 kids and I would have thanked you. That\u2019s a particular brand of family I struggle being around. They ruin everything from hay rides at the pumpkin patch to just hanging out at the park. Like, this isn\u2019t the set to their family movie, and other people deserve to enjoy themselves as well, and it\u2019s pretty hard to do that when you can\u2019t even hear yourself think.

As a father of young kids we live in a world where places are increasingly closed off for normal childhood fun. When I was a kid there would be kids on the street to play with, we have lost that, so kids can only be kids in select situations - trampoline parks / parks and ZOOs.\n\nMy kids are constantly being told to behave - which is against natural human nature at that age.

You were in a kid zone. Zoos are kid zones just as much as playgrounds and chucky cheez. Happy kids are the goal,  and sometimes happy kids vocalize pretty loudly.

I have a child but it\u2019s important to be respectful of surroundings. A zoo is an inappropriate place to be running like that, especially if there are playgrounds.

There are lots of places (like zoos) that you should be aware that children will be present, but that doesn't suddenly mean that they are the only patrons that matter.

You could say the same thing for Disney or Chuck E Cheese, or Toys R Us, parents pay for for all the places kids go, its kind of part of being a parent. Of course adults are allowed to go to zoos, I have been to many as an adult without kids, but I go knowing that the majority of the people there are young families, or  summer day camp trips. A lot of zoos, especially smaller local ones, are geared towards kids/families. If the kids were screaming inside an enclosed area or climbing the fences of an enclosure, sure speak up, but running around an open area? That's just par for the course if you're going somewhere that does cater to young families. You can try to mitigate it a bit by going during school hours or off peak times/season but it just is what it is.
