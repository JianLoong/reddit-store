It's rural, no HOA, and apparently the city doesn't have any regulations that would apply since the neighbor hasn't gotten any traction there.\n\nHOWEVER: you're likely not a \"good neighbor\" here. You think your long lawn and plantings are whimsical and natural, but your neighbors see it as overgrown and untended (sunchokes look pretty \"weedy.\"). They could also be concerned about whether some of your stuff might be migrating to their yard or encouraging more pests.\n\nNTA because they should have taken a more pleasant approach about this with you.
