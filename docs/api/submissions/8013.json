{"id": 8013, "submission_id": "10ithfd", "title": "AITA for only promoting college/high school employees to trainer/team lead over adult employees?", "selftext": "I\u2019m (25F) a manager at a restaurant, I became a manager a year ago. We have a few different managers but I\u2019m an assistant GM so I usually take care of interviews, new hires, making the schedule, etc.. At our work there\u2019s GM, assistant GM, Team Leads (aka trainers), then associates. \n\nMost of our employees are teens, mainly high school, and some college. We hired 5 new people last month, We also made a few high schoolers promoted to team lead.\n\nWe have an employee \u201cTara\u201d who\u2019s been here for 2 years, she\u2019s 20. She\u2019s very reliable and excellent with customers. She\u2019s been reliable back when she didn\u2019t have a car and used to walk across town to work. She has only called out once, ever, when she was sick. She\u2019d still continue to show up to work even when she knew she\u2019d be closing alone due to callouts, she\u2019s extremely fast, too. She\u2019s good about picking up shifts or working doubles, and she\u2019s cross-trained. However, even though she\u2019s worked here longer than the team leads, what she lacks is that she\u2019s the quietest of everyone. She\u2019s friendly but the college and high schoolers are just more fun and talkative, and always have stories to share from outside of work. I recently made a girl a team lead because her boyfriend is a team lead so it would be fitting for them to both be team leads, it\u2019s a better look with the team. it\u2019s hard not to favor them. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed when Tara is working and a new employee is working, she\u2019s always correcting the new employee when they\u2019re doing something wrong or poorly, or she\u2019s showing them how to do things or giving them something to do if they\u2019re standing around. She is only an associate, she is not a team lead/trainer, it\u2019s not her role to be training. Recently when she was doing this, the new employee thanked her and said she\u2019s been really helpful and nice to her. Again, Tara should not be \u201ctraining\u201d employees, Only team leads can train employees, not associates. \n\nWhen I confronted Tara she was saying \u201cSo when I see them doing something incorrectly I should just do nothing?\u201d And said that she was only being helpful to them. And apparently one time the new employee rang up an order wrong on the register because he didn\u2019t know had certain things were, so he just decided to hit something random hoping it was correct, and when \u201cTara\u201d made the drink the customer confronted her about it saying it was wrong, so Tara confronted the employee about it to see where it went wrong and explained to him how to ring  correctly. I stopped her in the middle of it and asked her what she was doing, she said she was explaining to him for future reference and telling him to always repeat the order back to the customer to make sure it's right. I told her it's not her role to do that and to just fix what the customer wants. Training people is not her job as only an associate. \n\nEver since, I noticed she doesn\u2019t make as much effort as she used to and just does, well, bare minimum. She\u2019s still a great employee, what I mean is she doesn\u2019t fill in as much anymore when we need someone to cover a shift. She was always a great fill in when we needed someone. She was sort of like a team lead, but without the title and I just feel she\u2019s better as a sub/fill in because when I need someone I really rely on her to pick up the shift because she\u2019s the more reliable of everyone else, especially sometimes because we have our morning team lead who usually wants to go home early lately, who does college after work. I just don\u2019t believe she\u2019d fit the role of being a team lead, as I mostly like to give it to students, she just works and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that as she\u2019s got more reliability than students so she can be helpful in that part of it, and the students can train the trainees. She\u2019s kind of quiet so I think trainees would have a hard time with her, the students are just more \u201cloud\u201d and talkative, making them naturally more appealing to be a trainer. I really don\u2019t have anything against Tara, she\u2019s very reliable and her not being chosen for a role doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like her. I usually choose students to be team leads because they get a raise typically and within a few years they\u2019ll move onto something elsewhere, which keeps the position moving with replacing different employees for different positions, where as a non student will likely always drag the position because they\u2019re unlikely to move on somewhere else which keeps the position \u201cstuck\u201d. Also, to clarify- there was a team lead that day but her shift ended so it was just Tara and the newer employee, and besides this employee is finished with his training so he\u2019s an associate like Tara. Does it make sense for an associate to tell an associate what to do?", "created_utc": 1674419702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ithfd/aita_for_only_promoting_collegehigh_school/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's doing EXACTLY what she should be? What is your actual problem here?", "YTA and you should definitely brush up on your people selection and communication skills, especially if you are actually in a hiring/promoting position. You don't like Tara as much because she's quiet but you recount many positives about Tara's work ethic and willingness/ability to keep the shift running smoothly by supporting members of the team. Those are the attributes that are valuable, not how much you enjoy hearing stories.\n\nEditing to add: you also completely shut Tara down, both emotionally and actually when you interrupted her explanation so you could make your point. That's why she isn't offering the best work right now.", "YTA Horrible boss, horrible attitude, you're making things not just worse for your employees but the customers as well. It's funny how people least suited to be leaders often end up on those positions", "YTA you promoted \u201cfun\u201d employees over a great one. And why stop her for teaching someone to use the register? She knows, she can show. That\u2019s just all AH behavior from you.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t make an effort for you anymore either. What\u2019s the motivation to? You aren\u2019t going to have her to rely on for much longer with this behavior.", "YTA - this poor girl can't win with you!\n\nFirstly, promoting people should not be based on who has the best stories from outside of work, it should be based on performance and you have made it clear that she performed better. \n\nSecondly, if she knows the role and knows how to correctly do the job, why can't she help train? It makes no sense to stop her from helping new employees.\n\nI really don't get what your problem is, she was doing you a favour by helping out and going above and beyond her role. One of the clearest YTA yet.", "YTA and you are a toxic boss. You promoted someone to be a team leader because her boyfriend was and it was a good look but the employee you find to be the most reliable you won't promote and you are actively punishing for going above and beyond? Let's be real. You are clearly threatened by Tara, probably because deep down you know she would do your job better. Eventually Tara will leave because you treat her like shit and go get a better job elsewhere and when the owner of your restaurant figures out that you are the reason good employees leave you will get fired. If there is a God you will then have to interview for a job under Tara.", "YTA - no wonder why people say working in restaurants suck. \u201cTara\u201d obviously should not only be a team manager she should be AGM. She is someone I would want running my business", "You\u2019re joking, right? YTA\n\nYou\u2019re basically a living caricature of an evil, incompetent, stupid boss. Frankly, you sound envious of and threatened by Tara (as you should be, to be clear: she IS better than you are), and as a result you\u2019re trying to do what all inferior managers do: keep her in \u201cher place.\u201d Because gosh, if she\u2019s promoted, she\u2019s one step closer to showing the GM how much better than you she is. \n\nTerrible, incompetent bosses almost invariably act to squash the motivation and advancement of more talented employees. It is pathetically routine. \n\nI\u2019d say that you should correct the situation, but you\u2019re 25 years old \u2026 this is who you are, pal. So enjoy your power play as you try to play the popular kid in high school (yeah, that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing with your fawning over the \u201cfun, talkative\u201d high school kids), because this is about as good as it gets for someone like you - low stakes environments where the incompetent and unintelligent can wield power over unskilled employees is where you thrive. Meanwhile, Tara will thrive anywhere and you\u2019ve inadvertently done her a favor by helping motivate her to seek a different job. \n\nOh, by the way, I promise those fun, cool high school kids think their 25 year old boss who dotes on them and wants to be their pal is pathetic. They are right.", "You suck as a manager and yes, you are the AH. You have a rockstar employee that makes you look good, yet you diminish her work because she\u2019s not outgoing and popular like your young \u201cchippies\u201d. Shame on you.   \n\n\nwhy would she make any extra effort when you embarrassed and shut her down. Go hand in your managers cap. You don\u2019t deserve to be in charge. You are using this employee. Give her the proper respect and the proper title.", "YTA for promoting employees based on their being \"fun, talkative, and sharing stories unrelated to work,\" rather than promoting the one who does the best work, takes the initiative to pick up the slack not performed by the people whose job it is, and has the most seniority.", "YTA. She was going above and beyond her job role to help and you told her to stop. She stopped like you said and now you have a problem with her doing that. Can she do anything right in your eyes?", "YTA. You acknowledge that she's a great employee and that you have not rewarded her for her efforts because... she's not talkative enough and the high schoolers are more fun? I don't blame her for starting to do the bare minimum - jfc you reprimanded her for correcting errors!! You should apologize and give her the f*n lead position. She's probably already looking for a better job.", "YTA and needs to lose your job for this", "Sounds like the people you pick aren't actually training anyone. YTA\n\nAnd now that you have broken this employee I bet she bounces sooner than later.", "YTA. Tara has what is called initiative and is a team player. She is taking the time to help. She was going over and above. She is the obvious person to promote but you pass her over for more fun people. She has showed up for your business and worked hard. Rather than valuing her for all that you shut her down. Why should she do more than the bare minimum for an employer who doesn't value her? You're lucky to have an employee who has stepped up and been committed to you. \n\nGosh I hope she gets a better job elsewhere, somewhere she is valued.", "Omg YTA and you should be fired. You're a terrible manager. Tara should have your job.", "Yta. Way to break a good employee\u2019s enthusiasm, loyalty and spirit. Also, your team leads are obviously shit at training.\nEta: if you want her to \u2018start helping out again\u2019 give her a promotion and a raise, AH.", "This is all over the place.\n\n> And apparently one time the new employee rang up an order wrong on the register because he didn\u2019t know had certain things were, so he just decided to hit something random hoping it was correct, \n\nWhere were the Trainers to correct this?  How did this happen if the new employees were supposed to be trained by the Trainers and know how to do this?  Is there a problem with performance of the Trainers?\n\n> Ever since, I noticed she doesn\u2019t make as much effort as she used to and just does, well, bare minimum. \n\nBut she got talked to when she didn't do the bare minimum.  How can you say \"it's not her role\" and then complain when they keep within their role (\"bare minimum\")?\n\n> She\u2019s still a great employee, what I mean is she doesn\u2019t fill in as much anymore when we need someone to cover a shift. \n\nYou took away her initiative and then complain about her not having initiative.\n\nYTA - this is kinda messed up.", "YTA\u2014you made it clear to her that she should just \u201cdo her job\u201d rather than make your workplace better because she doesn\u2019t have the team lead title. And you didn\u2019t feel she deserved the promotion despite her excellent performance and her ability to help others learn their job.  Because she\u2019s not talkative or fun enough.   You treat employees like crap and they\u2019re going to give you the bare minimum maybe start getting some of the \u201cfun\u201d teenagers to come in and cover shifts when you need them too", "So what you're saying is that the training isn't working, and you don't want to make the person who'd be good at training and leading the training and leading billets. You're punishing her and holding her back for being better at her job than she needs to be and better at other people's jobs than the ones holding them (including apparently yours). Never mind that your post title screams \"age discrimination.\" \n\nYTA, and hopefully she finds a better gig and a better boss soon.", "You told her to stop \"training\" other employees so she did. Of course she's going to stop doing more work than she had to after you reprimanded her for doing so. You can't have it both ways.  YTA", "Wow, you had a great employee with good motivation.  Not anymore.  \n\nAny reasonable person in Tara\u2019s place would do exactly what she is now doing - fulfilling her own obligations as an employee and nothing more.  In fact, don\u2019t be surprised if soon she gives you a two-week notice.\n\nAs a manager, you messed up.  And btw, \u201cloud\u201d \u201cfun\u201d and \u201ctalkative\u201d does not automatically translate to \u201ccompetent\u201d so if that is your standard for a lead or trainer\u2026 you need to fix yourself on that ASAP.\n\nYTA.  Heard?", "YTA. And the worst kind of boss.", "YTA. You have a complete rock star of an employee yet you promote people who have good stories? Why exactly are you so adamant not promoting her?", "Tara sounds like an exceptional employee, and you are holding her back to boost your own ego by getting chummy with the \u201ccool kids\u201d. Of course YTA! Poor Tara.", "YTA. From everything you've said, Tara deserves promotion. Your entire description of how helpful she has been with newer colleagues when they've done something wrong proves she has what it takes to calmly communicate with the trainees. And the fact it has been necessary for her to step in to correct them when something has gone wrong shows that the people whose job it is to train the trainees haven't been doing their jobs correctly/haven't been available to assist.\n\nAnd quiet can be a good thing when people are training and managing people, because a person can be watching, seeing when things go right and correctly them without drawing too much attention when something goes wrong.\n\nI also want to take issue with the way you told her off for helping the employee correct an error. You didn't have to tell it wasn't her role; you could have just thanked her and told her that you would take over showing her colleague.\n\nCongratulations in shooting yourself in the foot. Even if Tara doesn't hand her notice in as soon as something better comes along, you've taught your reliable cross-trained employee who is excellent with customers that there is no point in her putting the effort in because it is not appreciated by her jerk of a manager. And not only has Tara learnt that lesson, but anyone who was paying attention, like the new guy on the register who she'd helped, will see this too.", "So your best employee that picks up shifts, is fast and efficient and can help her coworkers understand and fix mistakes is the person that you\u2019ve decided not to promote? And instead you\u2019ve chosen trainers based on their aesthetic and relationship status rather than their ability to train, as the employees they\u2019re training are still making mistakes? And now you\u2019re wondering why she doesn\u2019t wanna pick up extra shift?  You should be worried about what you\u2019re gonna do when she ups and leave for a place that will appreciate and reward hard work.

The bare minimum, which is all you\u2019re paying her for. Tara will move beyond this job because she\u2019s exceptionally talented, and you can keep playing politics with high school and college kids.

If you want Tara doing more you need to give her a raise and promotion. \n\nSo now your mad that someone functioning as a team lead isn\u2019t anymore because you told her to quit behaving like a team lead? Sounds like you actually relied on her to fulfill some if not most of the requirements of a team lead and now are feeling the lag.\n\nAlso clearly she was training people as you only found out about issues when told after the fact.

Some of the best leaders I've known were the quiet and reliable types.  Some of the worst have been the \"talkers' because they often spend more of their time socializing vs. working.  Not all, but often.  You would be better to have a good mix of personality types based on reliability and skills, not how outgoing they are.\n\nThis is how you lose good employees.

We have a few different managers but I\u2019m closer to an assistant GM so I usually take care of interviews, new hires, making the schedule, etc. \n\nMost of our employees are teens, mainly high school, and some college. We hired 5 new people last month, We also made a few high schoolers promoted to team lead.\n\nWe have an employee \u201cTara\u201d who\u2019s been here for 2 years, she\u2019s 20. She\u2019s very reliable and excellent with customers. She\u2019s been reliable back when she didn\u2019t have a car and used to walk across town to work. She has only called out once, ever, when she was sick. She\u2019d still continue to show up to work even when she knew she\u2019d be closing alone due to callouts, she\u2019s extremely fast, too. She\u2019s good about picking up shifts or working doubles, and she\u2019s cross-trained. However, even though she\u2019s worked here longer than the team leads, what she lacks is that she\u2019s the quietest of everyone. She\u2019s friendly but the college and high schoolers are just more fun and talkative, and always have stories to share from outside of work, it\u2019s hard not to favor them. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed when Tara is working and a new employee is working, she\u2019s always correcting the new employee when they\u2019re doing something wrong or poorly, or she\u2019s showing them how to do things or giving them something to do if they\u2019re standing around. She is only an associate, she is not a team lead/trainer, it\u2019s not her role to be training. Recently when she was doing this, the new employee thanked her and said she\u2019s been really helpful and nice to her. Again, Tara should not be \u201ctraining\u201d employees, Only team leads can train employees, not associates. \n\nWhen I confronted Tara she was saying \u201cSo when I see them doing something incorrectly I should just do nothing?\u201d And said that she was only being helpful to them. And apparently one time the new employee rang up an order wrong on the register because he didn\u2019t know had certain things were, so he just decided to hit something random hoping it was correct, and when \u201cTara\u201d made the drink the customer confronted her about it saying it was wrong, so Tara confronted the employee about it to see where it went wrong and explained to him how to ring  correctly. I stopped her in the middle of it and asked her what she was doing, she said she was explaining to him for future reference and telling him to always repeat the order back to the customer to make sure it's right. I told her it's not her role to do that and to just fix what the customer wants. \n\nEver since, I noticed she doesn\u2019t make as much effort as she used to and just does, well, bare minimum. She\u2019s still a great employee, what I mean is she doesn\u2019t fill in as much anymore when we need someone to cover a shift. She was always a great fill in when we needed someone.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yet the only problem is she's a bit quiet, I don't even consider that a problem as you said she's quick and friendly with customers which means she's good to the customers. She's good to other employees helping them, giving them tips, and she even put herself between one and an angry customer in that instance you mentioned to solve the issue.   \n\n\nLastly, this is only my personal opinion, but she deserves a promotion, not only for all those things I mentioned above(that you agreed with), but also the fact of the matter is she probably needs it, she walked to work when she didn't have a car, she rarely ever stopped coming even when she was sick (no way she only got sick once in 2 years), she takes extra opportunities and double shifts.
