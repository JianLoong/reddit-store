Your SIL has abandoned your child in her care for her pleasure.  If she neglected or abandoned your child again and child protective services were notified, that would be on you.  She showed you who she is to a completely dependent being.  Believe her.", "> we came home to our daughter crying in our neighbor\u2019s arms while my SIL went to see a movie with her boyfriend\n\nThis is an obvious lifetime ban from ever being responsible for a child.\n\nHonestly kind of concerning that your husband doesn't think of it like that. NTA, good luck.", "NTA.   Your SIL is not reliable.   Your husband is being a jerk.", "NTA\n\nLet him go to the wedding. Your SIL obviously cannot be trusted with your child.\n\nWhen it comes to baby sitters, my solution was to start by asking staff/teachers at the daycare my son goes to. Daycare may be expensive as hell but they're paid crap, so many do that on the side. Of course...   this would require you being able to afford daycare in the first place and, well, damn it's expensive.\n\nMight the neighbors be willing, perhaps? I'd imagine if they're willing they'd probably even tell you not to worry about paying, but you should probably offer a proper rate if you ask them.", "NTA - your SIL violated your trust. I'd be concerned that your partner doesn't seem on the same page with you on this. There is absolutely no excuse for what she did and it would make me incredibly insecure to leave my kid with her again after that. I think the bigger problem here is that your partner doesn't see it that way.", "NTA. You have very valid reasons; he doesn't. Frankly, 2 is a great time to try to lock down a sitter.", "NTA But your husband sure is. His sister abandoned your baby to go on a date. She can not EVER be left alone with your child. \n\nYour husband thinks this is just fine. Your husband also can not be trusted to care for your daughter. He'd be fine leaving her with SIL if he needed a sitter.", "NTA - your SIL was extremely unreliable. I would most certainly nit let her babysit again. \n\n\u2026can the neighbor babysit again though?", "Your SIL is an irresponsible AH.  Lucky you have such nice neighbors.  If your husband will not consent to a babysitter, then stay home it will be.  NTA.", "NTA.

A trained stranger would be a better babysitter than your SIL. NTA but your husband kinda is...", "NTA. Your SIL proved she couldn't be relied on to babysit the second she left your kid with the neighbors the second her boyfriend wanted to take her to the movie. She may deserve another chance at some point, but when you'll be several hours away at a wedding is not the time to give her another shot at it.", "NTA\n\nYour husband basically wants to put your child at risk with an irresponsible adult to go to a wedding, which at the end of the day isn't going to change without you two.", "So why is your husband so willing to leave your 2 year old with someone who has already proven they're untrustworthy and unreliable?

This would be my hill to die on and I'll be honest, I would be rethinking our relationship.", "NTAHe could have gone to the wedding. Why didn't he? Are you guys attached thru the skin? \\[I see in a comment he chose not to go alone, but that was HIS choice.\\] \n\nYou are valid in not wanting the unreliable SIL to babysit. He is also valid in not wanting stranger-danger. He is not right for being upset because you (just like him) have criteria for babysitters.\n\nThis situation showed the need to have more than one babysitter, who fills both criteria, available (your mom). Get at least a second person as an alternative.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the dynamic of your marriage. A baby puts strain in a marriage. But sometimes, it is best to be alone for a while...", "NTA although from the sounds of it, your child would be better off with a stranger than his sister....", "NTA. \n\nYour husband is a dumbass and an irresponsible man.

She CANNOT be trusted with your baby , and your husband is AH for even suggesting that.", "NTA \n\nYour SIL has proved that she is irresponsible and your child takes priority over everything. Stand your ground. Do what's best for your child", "NTA. You had valid reasons for not wanting SIL to \u201cwatch\u201d your kid again.

Also seems like your husband grew up with issues in his family if he wants to ignore minor details like that.", "He thinks a stranger would be worse than a sister who ditches a baby with a neighbor without explanation??

What if something had happened to your daughter, like choking on something, and they didn't have a way to contact you? Obviously nothing bad did end up happening, but it could have.
