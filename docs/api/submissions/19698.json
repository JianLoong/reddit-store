TAH is the husband.\n\nSeems like he\u2019s more worried about missing his friends wedding then how your daughter is taken care of.\n\nWho wants to leave his daughter with a person who he knows isn\u2019t capable or chose not to be capable, of babysitting.\n\nMy youngest child is 32 so it\u2019s been a while since I checked up on this stuff but I live in the US survey and 12 years old is the legal age to babysit a child. 12 years old and his sister couldn\u2019t even behave to the standards of a 12 year old.\n\nLet hubby go. Stay home from the wedding with your daughter.\n\nThat should give you plenty of time to think about your situation. And the fact that it\u2019s going to be quite a while till your daughters 18. Is this really the life you have been imagining when you said I do?", "NTA. But kinda sounds like you have a husband problem more than a SIL problem.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t leave my child with her after that stunt. But your husband could of went to the wedding by himself instead of being a sour puss and insisting you leave your child with someone incompetent.", "NTA at all. I\u2019d rather leave my kid with a professional who has recommendations & is doing it as a job than with an unreliable person doing a favour. \nIt\u2019s not like you refused to go as soon as your mum cancelled, he refused the options you put on the table therefore he decided to skip the wedding.", "Of course not the asshole for the SIL thing.  You would be an asshole to that wedding couple for making them pay for spots when you have time to figure out babysitting.At the very least just one of you go. You go or he goes.", "Unless there is some backstory about you always being late to relive her and:or she told you that she had a hard stop and you were more than an hour late and knew the neighbors, or some derivative of that, then never let her babysit again.", "NTA so SIL is careless and hubby is a petty brat. I\u2019m guessing the rest of your in laws also have glaring faults in their character?", "NTA and what the heck kinda father is that?  Your husband needs to grow up and come to the realization his sister is not good with toddlers.  The fact that she left her unattended should be the biggest red flag, so I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s a child or an adult. GLOP", ">My husband refused to let a stranger look after our kid\n\nWell, if you leave your kid with SIL, it sounds like that's exactly what you'll get in the end! That's literally what SIL did the last time she was in charge, was left the kid with a stranger, how does your husband not realize that???\n\nNTA", "He could have gone to the wedding, by himself. Sounds like he just wanted an excuse to be a jerk. \nNo frickin way, would I let the SIL have another chance to be irresponsible, when you're 3 hours from home! \n\nNTA.", "I don't even HAVE children but you are NTA for not wanting SIL to watch your kid. You have a husband problem", "NTA", "NTA what is wrong with your husband?  A professional childcare specialist is not ok but his completely immature and unreliable sister is ok??!! Nope. Is husband's decision making always this bad?", "NTA. Your husband is an AH if he is willing to trust your child with his sister ever again", "NTA. You should be concerned that your husband is ok with a neglectful person watching your child.", "NTA", "NTA. I'm concerned about your husband's judgement. If my husband found out that his sibling, who we asked to babysit, had left our kid with a neighbor to go to a movie, that sibling would be read the riot act and 86'ed from babysitter duties forever.", "NTA\u2026 does your asshole husband even care about your child?", "ABSOLUTELY NTA. A stranger would be much more appropriate", "NTA but the problem here is not your SIL (irresponsible as she is) but rather your husband. I can't imagine any situation where a parent would think it's ok to put their child at risk so that they can attend a wedding! You should reevaluate your marriage and whether you can trust your husband to protect your child", "Nta- your husband won\u2019t let a stranger babysit but has no issues with his sister leaving you kid with a stranger. At least the babysitter stays", "NTA. People who have child free weddings are 100% to blame when parents can't make it. The end. SIL did some egregious and abusive dirt the last time you left kiddo with her. She's done.", "nta.  she literally ditched your kids at your neighbors the last time.  she's never watching them again.  period.", "Please don\u2019t leave the baby with SIL she showed you exactly who she is. What I don\u2019t understand is how is your DH ok with giving her another chance? What happens if the neighbors aren\u2019t home and SIL wants another date is the baby replaceable? DH is acting like that\u2019s the case I guess he\u2019s ok with what she did. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with him? He\u2019s not ok with a babysitter but he was ok with a neighbor who definitely is a stranger? Sorry but you don\u2019t only have a SIL problem you have a major husband problem,\nHe\u2019s putting his sister above your baby\u2019s safety and that\u2019s sad. I don\u2019t know what you need to do but maybe counseling could help? Or just walk away cause you DH is not acting like a rational human being", "NTA... So husband is afraid of a proffesional babysitter that he doesn't know BUT is willing to use a babysitter that has proven herself negligent?\n\nYour husband suffers from faulty reasoning.  EDITed to add: the passive aggressive, my way or we cancel, is a concerning, selfish and manipulative behavior. Watch how it manifests in other ways. It is not normal, it is an ugly habit, that is raising red flags.", "NTA you would be if you let SIL watch you kid again. Your husband is not thinking logically", "Please update us cause this is just an unbelievable situation.

Frank should never be responsible for a child.   OP is correct to value her child\u2019s safety over a party.", "Between SIL with a known history of being unreliable and making terrible child watching decisions and a babysitter you can get recommendations for or see their ratings online, it makes no sense to have insisted on only SIL.  NTA.  What she did gets a \"never again\" unless she grows up a lot and makes serious changes to her behavior.  Your husband sounds like he was raised in the same family ...   and what he wants to do comes before everything.  Sorry.", "The answer is probably the same as why the sister was so willing to drop the baby on the neighbors so she could go to the movies----selfish and entitled. I want what I want when I want it. Same reason he's mad about missing the wedding----who cares about the kid, I want to go have fun.   \nOP is definitely NTA but her husband and his sister both are.", "Why is Op the  A  H for not having a backup plan?   The husband is just as responsible for sourcing reliable childcare", ">Of course, your SO thought you had a backup, his irresponsible sister. **You, on the other hand, have no such excuse.**\n\n>He is TA for even considering his sister after her proven neglect. **You are TA for not having a backup plan.**\n\nHonestly Wow.", "Yeah, I get not wanting to miss out on a friends wedding, but you definitely have an SIL and husband problem.  Your husband is being unreasonable by being passive aggressive about the situation when his sister literally could have put your child in danger. Does she know your neighbors, is she aware they are safe people with which to leave your child? \n\nHow old is she? She sounds ridiculous irresponsible and immature. I mean what if her bf or a friend wants to do something and no one is around with which for her to leave your child? Will she just go out, will she drag your child with her? \n\nYour husband needs to realize being a parent means putting your child\u2019s well being first, even if that means skipping a wedding. His sister had proven she can\u2019t be a trusted caregiver. \n\nNTA.", "Sadly, this is a husband problem, and a bigger one than the wedding. Your neighbors could have been sex offenders and your husband isn't viewing past events with your daughter's life at stake as an option. But just because things worked out once doesn't mean things went well. A drunk driver getting home safely the first time they drink and drive isn't an endorsement to do it again! And until he realizes he's looking at the problem wrong... he's seriously an AH, and that's the tip of the iceberg.", "Babysitter is a totally rational compromise, it\u2019s their job.  Unless your sister is in driving distance.  You can help someone with a bad foot and watch a kid.", "Odds are if they go with SIL, their kid might end up with a stranger anyway!", "And they would be 3 hours away, making sil even more questionable.", "Sad he\u2019d choose his little sister over his own child.", "That second chance should come at a time when you\u2019ll be gone for less time and not as far away, with a backup ready, and ways to check in. If and when you\u2019re comfortable with it, which you may never be if your SIL doesn\u2019t demonstrate greater maturity and trustworthiness in other areas of her life. \n\nHonestly I might have snapped at your husband that the last time you asked his sister to babysit your child ended up in the care of strangers anyway, at least if you choose a babysitter you get to pick *which* stranger in advance.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t do second chances with my kids. Put them in harms way once, it would be near impossible for me to allow that chance again. \n\nNot the same situation and not to scare you, but a family in [FL learned that tragic lesson](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna77766).

I suggest you adopt a similar attitude.", "Yeah that doesn\u2019t apply in this situation. Has she acknowledged what she did or apologized? Has she done anything to earn your trust back or show that she actually gives a damn about your kid? I suspect the answer is no to both questions.
