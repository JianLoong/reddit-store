My mom and Joan both have 2 kids. Im the youngest of 4 between them and the only one who lives in the same state (5 hours away). I am the only one who visits yearly, though I visit multiple times through out the year.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was driving through for work and said I could stop for dinner and stay one night. My mom and dad get along well even though they are divorced. So my mom invited my dad over so we could all have dinner together since I was around for 1 night.\n\nMy dad makes pizzas for dinner and put them in the oven. Joan is on her computer in her office.  hasn't said much to either of us since we got there. I pull up the SNF game on my laptop while im waiting. The table was made, we just needed to wait for the food. Everyone else was doing their own thing as the food cooked.\n\nWithin a few minutes Joan is walking around and sees me watching football. She says \"Turn that off, we are eating dinner\". I reply that the food is still cooking and we aren't eating dinner right now. She starts complaining about it so I just ignore her like usual and mute the game. Joan comes in the room again;\"we can have dinner or football but not both\". I tell her I will turn it off when the food is close to done. She keeps going so I close my laptop.\n\nSo I'm sitting there in silence, waiting for dinner. Joan keeps coming in and out and complaining about me watching football even though it is off. I tell her she can stop complaining cause the game is off. She kept going and I was just ignoring her. Then she said \"Respect your elders\". I sat there and ignored her but she kept going. \"I'm 65, I have way more life experience than you\". I reply \"age isn't an indicator of life exeperience\". She says \"I have a PHD, you only have a masters\" (who cares? I know people with GEDs that are more successful than PhDs). I said \"my masters is in ag science which is way more important than your literature PHD, which doesn't really matter. Who gives a shit about literature?\" \"I actually add value to society\". (I do value literature and all education, I was just sick of being attacked, so I defended myself). By this time my Mom was telling Joan to let it go and walk away and that was the end of it. Joan ended up getting in her car and leaving for the night after a tense and awkward dinner.\n\nNow my mom tells me their relationship may be ending after 8 years and I feel at bed. This isn't the first time Joan has attacked me or criticized me. I generally shrug it off cause that is who Joan is at the core and I just want to see my parents. My brother can't be in the same room with Joan cause it always ends in a yelling match. My mom has never once be rude to or criticized Joan's children, keep in mind.\n\nAITA for telling my mom's partner her PhD doesn't matter?", "created_utc": 1669138869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1zqqz/aita_for_telling_my_moms_partner_her_phd_doesnt/", "score": 551, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
