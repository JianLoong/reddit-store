My mom and Joan both have 2 kids. Im the youngest of 4 between them and the only one who lives in the same state (5 hours away). I am the only one who visits yearly, though I visit multiple times through out the year.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was driving through for work and said I could stop for dinner and stay one night. My mom and dad get along well even though they are divorced. So my mom invited my dad over so we could all have dinner together since I was around for 1 night.\n\nMy dad makes pizzas for dinner and put them in the oven. Joan is on her computer in her office.  hasn't said much to either of us since we got there. I pull up the SNF game on my laptop while im waiting. The table was made, we just needed to wait for the food. Everyone else was doing their own thing as the food cooked.\n\nWithin a few minutes Joan is walking around and sees me watching football. She says \"Turn that off, we are eating dinner\". I reply that the food is still cooking and we aren't eating dinner right now. She starts complaining about it so I just ignore her like usual and mute the game. Joan comes in the room again;\"we can have dinner or football but not both\". I tell her I will turn it off when the food is close to done. She keeps going so I close my laptop.\n\nSo I'm sitting there in silence, waiting for dinner. Joan keeps coming in and out and complaining about me watching football even though it is off. I tell her she can stop complaining cause the game is off. She kept going and I was just ignoring her. Then she said \"Respect your elders\". I sat there and ignored her but she kept going. \"I'm 65, I have way more life experience than you\". I reply \"age isn't an indicator of life exeperience\". She says \"I have a PHD, you only have a masters\" (who cares? I know people with GEDs that are more successful than PhDs). I said \"my masters is in ag science which is way more important than your literature PHD, which doesn't really matter. Who gives a shit about literature?\" \"I actually add value to society\". (I do value literature and all education, I was just sick of being attacked, so I defended myself). By this time my Mom was telling Joan to let it go and walk away and that was the end of it. Joan ended up getting in her car and leaving for the night after a tense and awkward dinner.\n\nNow my mom tells me their relationship may be ending after 8 years and I feel at bed. This isn't the first time Joan has attacked me or criticized me. I generally shrug it off cause that is who Joan is at the core and I just want to see my parents. My brother can't be in the same room with Joan cause it always ends in a yelling match. My mom has never once be rude to or criticized Joan's children, keep in mind.\n\nAITA for telling my mom's partner her PhD doesn't matter?", "created_utc": 1669138869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1zqqz/aita_for_telling_my_moms_partner_her_phd_doesnt/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She picked a fight and lost.", "NTA. Joan has driven away BOTH of her kids and your older sibling. She tried for the whole set and failed. IF their relationship is ending, so be it. Not your fault because honestly your mother should have stomped her nonsense out years ago.", "NTA - you, at most, precipitated a fight between your mother and Joan about something very much other than her degree and football. It just seems like she was in the mood to be unpleasant and took it out on you.\n\nJoan seems like a chore. Next she'll be mentioning an IQ test she took 45 years ago to prove how much respect she deserves.", "NTA. She sounds like a real AH. Your mom is probably better off without this woman and if one simple argument with you can ruin an 8 year relationship, then the relationship has other issues anyways.", "While PHDs for any subject should be valued and not demeaned as less than, only a toolbag uses that as a point of contention. Sounds like there is many underlying issues that is causing this reaction from her. NTA.", "NTA - Joan was WAY out of line here and I suspect that there is more going on between your mother and Joan than in this post.  \n\nIt is very wrong for your mother to blame you for HER relationship breaking up.  I hope she is just lashing out with her comments.\n\nJoan brought up education, you can say whatever you want about hers after that. But I don't think what you said really made a difference to the situation.", "NTA.  The relationship isn't ending because of you.  She has alienated your mom from most of her family through her behavior.  Although you did miss a good moment when she said to \"respect your elders\" to tell her that you will when she respects her betters.", "NTA - it sounds like you're a grown-ass adult and she's treating you like a child. If she treats you like a child, she can expect childish answers.", "No she is an asshole. Degrees do not equate to life experiences. I do not care if she has a PhD, that does not mean anything. Not many people even have a masseters degree and for her to piss on it and act like it is nothing is ridiculous. You do not owe her anything. You are an adult and should be treated like one. She is treating you as if you are 13 and that is not acceptable. I am sorry to say she is the one who does not have any respect", "NTA. She is trying to assert dominance/control over a situation because she feels out of control of her own life or is just a control freak. She was picking that fight and you just said stupid stuff to try and make her feel bad and stop attacking you. In the whole scheme of things, it wasn\u2019t that bad. (And I would LOVE to have a PhD in literature.) \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019re responsible for their relationship ending. Can you imagine if she acts like that with you, how she treats your mother? Let it go. Be supportive of your Mom and try to ignore her.", "NTA. Be there for your mom when they split.", "NTA. She's aggro and half off her rocker. If your mom is splitting with her it's got nothing to do with you or your flight. On the off chance the break up doesn't take? And she stays in the picture? Develop some strategies for not engaging with her when she is around. Just let it go.", "NTA. People who bring up their degrees needlessly in conversation like this HAVE to be the most insecure people ever.", "NTA - As they say, play stupid games win stupid prizes. She antagonizes you its only natural to lash out. Furthermore, a piece of paper means LITERALLY nothing depending on who you are. I know people with three degrees who are dumber than a bag of rocks and people who don't have their GED who are brilliant. The degree doesn't determine the brilliance of a person, the person determines the worth of the degree.", "NTA. Joan was intent on picking on you, which is why it didn't make any difference once you turned off the game. She attacked and you defended.  I'm sure she's had countless conversations like this over the course of her life, stop worrying about it.", "Normally I'd say YTA (that's a mean thing to say and it obviously matters \\*to her\\*), but she was being such a raging asshole that almost nothing you could say could make you TA. So NTA.\n\nThis isn't (and never was) about football. There are clearly deeper issues at play and this is just the event she chose to focus on and use as an outlet for her dissatisfaction.", "Joan was looking for a fight. You helped her find one. NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA, sounds like Joan was upset about something else, and focused on you watching the game. She tried to throw her weight around and didn't expect you to push back. She got what she deserved; it doesn't matter how old you are you don't disrespect people and expect them to respect you. You stood up for yourself and she couldn't handle that, she tried to throw her PHD in your face while dismissing your Masters. That in itself was a low blow.\n\nIf your mother's relationship ends because her partner doesn't have decorum it is on them not you", "I think you lost when you started arguing on her level about who has the more valued degree.\n\nThe only thing to say when told to 'respect your elders' is 'your behavior makes that impossible in your case'. Or offer to genuflect at her feet in awe.\n\nAnyway, NTA for say the PhD doesn't matter but a bit of an A H for arguing.", "Honestly, the whole bunch of you seem a little off to me. You go to visit your parents, but none of you are interacting at all, and you're watching a game on your laptop while waiting to be fed.\n\nI think in Joan's place I'd have thoughts about people who came into my space for no apparent reason and just did their own thing. But at 65, she should know enough to keep those thoughts to herself. You should know enough not to go to somebody's home and keep doing things that you know annoy them. And both of you should be above the childish taunts and insults.

Joan is also ignorant to claim it matters.  It seems they were already having problems, but you can defend yourself better.", "ESH. She was being ridiculous about the game, but the way you responded to her also sucked.", "Stupid question but why tf would you watch football if you are there for your parents? You couldn\u2019t talk to them? Like just for that YTA. You don\u2019t get to see them that often and then you rather watch football than spend time with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
