My mom and Joan both have 2 kids. Im the youngest of 4 between them and the only one who lives in the same state (5 hours away). I am the only one who visits yearly, though I visit multiple times through out the year.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was driving through for work and said I could stop for dinner and stay one night. My mom and dad get along well even though they are divorced. So my mom invited my dad over so we could all have dinner together since I was around for 1 night.\n\nMy dad makes pizzas for dinner and put them in the oven. Joan is on her computer in her office.  hasn't said much to either of us since we got there. I pull up the SNF game on my laptop while im waiting. The table was made, we just needed to wait for the food. Everyone else was doing their own thing as the food cooked.\n\nWithin a few minutes Joan is walking around and sees me watching football. She says \"Turn that off, we are eating dinner\". I reply that the food is still cooking and we aren't eating dinner right now. She starts complaining about it so I just ignore her like usual and mute the game. Joan comes in the room again;\"we can have dinner or football but not both\". I tell her I will turn it off when the food is close to done. She keeps going so I close my laptop.\n\nSo I'm sitting there in silence, waiting for dinner. Joan keeps coming in and out and complaining about me watching football even though it is off. I tell her she can stop complaining cause the game is off. She kept going and I was just ignoring her. Then she said \"Respect your elders\". I sat there and ignored her but she kept going. \"I'm 65, I have way more life experience than you\". I reply \"age isn't an indicator of life exeperience\". She says \"I have a PHD, you only have a masters\" (who cares? I know people with GEDs that are more successful than PhDs). I said \"my masters is in ag science which is way more important than your literature PHD, which doesn't really matter. Who gives a shit about literature?\" \"I actually add value to society\". (I do value literature and all education, I was just sick of being attacked, so I defended myself). By this time my Mom was telling Joan to let it go and walk away and that was the end of it. Joan ended up getting in her car and leaving for the night after a tense and awkward dinner.\n\nNow my mom tells me their relationship may be ending after 8 years and I feel at bed. This isn't the first time Joan has attacked me or criticized me. I generally shrug it off cause that is who Joan is at the core and I just want to see my parents. My brother can't be in the same room with Joan cause it always ends in a yelling match. My mom has never once be rude to or criticized Joan's children, keep in mind.\n\nAITA for telling my mom's partner her PhD doesn't matter?", "created_utc": 1669138869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1zqqz/aita_for_telling_my_moms_partner_her_phd_doesnt/", "score": 1871, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But your mom should have backed her off when the put downs started for sure. \n\nAs I always say if you don\u2019t want to handle the situation then it gets handled for you and you may not like the outcome.", "I always hated people who think just because they had the privilege to have good or higher educations are superior. Like get over yourself Joan\u2026 nobody cares about your degrees if you are still an asshole. Bye", "Nta good riddance", "NTA. If the relationship is ending because she is that controlling and insecure, well good", "NTA but wants the point of your visit to visit with family? You were only there 1 night and are on your laptop?", "NTA, and keep in mind it should be Joan's continuous bad behaviour that ends their relationship. Not your one comment, after she's badgered you until you couldn't take it anymore. You didn't even have the game on, and she still kept on about it! This isn't about you, it's about her. Shame on your mum for letting someone treat her children that way.", "NTA ageism annoys me. You can be old and experienced and still be dumb. You can be young and inexperienced and still be smart. Your opinion.\nBtw if she leaves your mom because of something YOU said, she clearly isn't the most mature person in the room.", "I really hope for an update on this. I'm stunned the mother let this happen for so long...", "If you're an asshole, there's no PHD in the world that can nullify it. You're still an asshole and deserves no respect. On the contrary, you even deserve less respect than an uneducated person acting like an asshole out of ignorance while you should know better. Elitist academics deserves nothing but spit, tar and feathers.", "I bet she's the sort who insists on being called Dr and corrects people in a really obnoxious way too because she has a PHD", "Oh I unfortunately do know a few 60 yrs old who say that (usually it's the ones where theyve got a few loose screws in the head).\n\nI love it when my 101 great grandmother steps in for one of those though. She will chew you up, spit out, chew you up again, spit you out again, and then shit on you while waving a wooden spoon at you.", "Same, I literally don\u2019t even mention my phd to 99% of people I meet\u2014 why would I? It only comes into play in my professional settings where everyone else has a phD too. I certainly don\u2019t think it makes me better or even smarter than anyone else.", "NTA, but go see your mom more often after Joan leaves. Invite your brother and your dad, too. Your mom will need the support.", "Lol", "USian here, my mom used to say, don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't cash. Much longer but still fun.", "American here.  I might have to steal that quote for future use!", "The American version isn't that different. It's \"talk shit, get hit\".", "Yes! WLW relationships are not exempt from domestic violence", "Love that!", "Go for your life mate! It does come in handy", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have said that, and you know it. However, she\u2019s definitely an AH, which is probably a much bigger part of why their relationship is ending than your also obnoxious behavior. I do think you behaved badly, but she was worse.", "You wouldn't be TA if you'd not made fun of Joan's \"useless\" degree.", "ES  - you had your laptop on in the room and others could hear?  You came to visit but sat in the kitchen and ignored people while you watched a game?\n\n I don't get football and certainly now the world cup is on in such horrific circumstances, even the thought of football is offensive.  Men chasing a ball as though they are doing something constructive - and all the fuss .  \n\nYou yelled at Joan for all kinds of reasons but I'd say her thinking a Phd was the be all end all, was the least of it.", "NTA, she was buttmad you were enjoying sports instead of whatever she likes. \n\nalso i cant believe her ego to think that a modern phd in literature is more important that freaking AG science with all the bs going on in the world right now.", "NTA. if that is what caused the relationship to end, then GOOD RIDDANCE. What a terrible lady.", "NTA \n\nJoan is an ahole and your mom too. Why is your mom trying to place the blame of her crappy relationship into you? Joan is obviously pretentious and only wanted to pick a fight. Your mom is unrealistic and needs to open her eyes to the actual problems in her relationship", "\u201cRespect your elders\u201d is only uttered by people whose personality merits disrespect. \n\nNTA", "Nta and trust me, there relationship was likely ending already, she sounds insufferable. You were minding your own business and she isn't your parent.", "NTA. She clearly just wanted to pick a fight.", "NTA. Joan needs to grow up.", "Dang! I'm 61f and would have made you scoot over to let me watch too! Turn the sound up so I can hear it better!\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "NTA Joan had successfully pushed away your siblings with her behavior. You didn\u2019t back down this time so she\u2019s throwing a tantrum by threatening to end the relationship. Your mom would be better off without Joan.", "I\u2019m assuming Joan is quick to let people know she is a doctor right? You-NTA, Joan - pretentious YTA.", "NTA.  I have a PhD and would never throw it up as something that gives me any more experience than anyone else except in my field (and not even then all the time).  Most people who know me outside of work don\u2019t even know or care that I have a PhD (mostly because it isn\u2019t uncommon in my city and it\u2019s just not that special.)\n\nAlso wanted to add that your argument with Joan did not break up an 8 year relationship and you don\u2019t have any responsibility here.  Sounds like Joan is toxic and the relationship had run its course.", "NTA. Joan sounds like a miserable human who hates everyone and everything.", "NTA - no relationship of 8 years ends because someone did not turn off a tv.   If it is ending it is not because of you - there were underlying problems", "OP, Joan has severe self-esteem issues that are way outta your paygrade. You are not responsible for her inability to be a life partner to anyone. Only she is responsible.", "NTA. Respect is earned, not given!", "yeah its pretty clear what the issue is", "I have said it at 45, but during a tickle fight with my kids while I lose.  \n\nRespect must be earned, fear can be enforced.", "Oh it's definitely a thing.", "This made me laugh so fucking hard, it really is ridiculous lol", "I don't know much since I stopped at a Bachelor's degree, but I always saw Phd as something you do if you want to research and teach as well.\n\nI can see why someone might have a personal bucket list of obtaining a Phd as a personal achievement I guess, but if you're not doing research or teaching I don't see how you're actually using it.", "i DONT LIKE HER TO !", "I don't like her either!", "I like the new ones like they fucked around and found out.", "We have an entire humanities section at the medical school where I work and all the students (MD and physicians assistant) are required to take medical humanities classes in order to graduate.", "If you're completing a PhD in a department known for their research output far higher expectations are set and ability assumed. \n\nThere's no getting away with low quality unoriginal research, the expectation is that you produce something completely novel and unique, this alone makes it harder."]}
