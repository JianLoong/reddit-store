It is a cultural things, if many of you are half latinos but weren't raised in a latin country then you probably missed out this. In school tienditas with zillions of kids and everybody screaming at the same time to order their food.

Whenever I've heard someone use the excuse \"I'm Latina, we're just loud\" they're using the race/culture card to deflect moderating their volume depending on where they are (and they're usually loud as fuck, even for someone who's used to passionate talking/conversations). Coming from a mixed ethnicity family, you can find a middle ground.\n\nIt sounds like everyone else isn't being extremely loud because he isn't asking anyone else to tone it down. How does the rest of your family react to his requests?\n\nYou can be yourself without yelling all the time.

I think to shut his request down immediately might not help you in the long run. Maybe have a conversation about it. Are you also louder than anyone else in you family/friend get-togethers? Because he says only you not the whole \"situation\". So, try to reduce the volume maybe a bit?", "NTA. He shouldn't have married you if it was a problem. You're willing to be quite at sometimes and not quiet at others. Leaving the room is an option for him, he can adjust himself to accommodate his own needs.

It\u2019s really annoying and it hurts my head and causes my ears to ring constantly which really sucks. I think that you are kinda dismissing your partners feelings a bit here.\n\nEDIT: It\u2019s also a bit odd to excuse your actions by feeding into the \u201cloud Latina\u201d stereotype.", "**YTA**\n\nFirst of all, anytime you tell someone who is asking you nicely to please stop doing something COMPLETELY UNNNECESSARY that is causing them actual pain to \"suck it up\", because you can't be arsed to be thoughtful, you're very clearly being an AH. That's literally like, the definition of being an asshole: being so self-absorbed that you could change something small to help someone and you won't simply because you don't feel like it, even though it really wouldn't affect you meaningfully at all.\n\nSecondly, YTA for perpetuating a gross trope about your own people. Your whole \"I can't help being loud, I'm Latina\" is beyond offensive . . . there's nothing worse than people who perpetuate ugly stereotypes about their own people and try to pass them off as their whole personality. I have plenty of Latino/a family members and dear friends from multiple Central and South American countries, who just like any other group of people have a variety of different personalities. Hilariously, a good number are gentle, quiet, and work in the caring professions. So your whole, \"he can't ask me to be quiet - I'm Latina, being loud and obnoxious is genetic for me!\" is just gross. And for the record, I'm saying this as someone whose ethnic group has similar stereotypes, and I find it just as obnoxious when I see women of my culture leaning into them. \n\nBut mostly YTA because you sound like you don't even LIKE your husband. You literally married this man, made vows to him, are supposed to be partners in life. He is telling you that you are CAUSING HIM PAIN, and your response is . . . \"suck it up or get lost, I'm having fun\"?\n\nI don't understand the N-T-As here at all. All these people saying he should get earplugs or noise reducing headphones or whatever . . . literally anything other than his own wife and her family just BEING SLIGHTLY MORE THOUGHTFUL and slightly less shrieky.

Your husband has an equal ability to yours to set the rules of the home when guests are visting, regardless of your relation to them. Yes, I'm well aware he's criticizing you and not the family guests, but it's his home, too, and you should work together to have the best environment possible for both of you in the home. That may entail him leaving the home for a bit, sure. If, however, he is the guest in someone else's home, he does not have a say in the matter of normal conduct.", "NTA. You are insistent this is an important part of who you are. He is insistent he can't handle it. The answer here seems obvious. How can you have a future with someone who can't stand who you are?

If he has a problem with the noise then he should leave the room or wear ear plugs.", "Hmmm idk I get loud and excited when I\u2019m happy to! My ex used to try and shut me down when I\u2019m just expressing myself being happy & tbh that would hurt me a lot.

My entire family gets LOUD when we\u2019re together. It doesn\u2019t make sense for OP\u2019s partner to tell her to be more quiet when he\u2019s the only one with the issue. And OP says she\u2019s already quiet around his family AND when they\u2019re alone so there\u2019s no reason for her to do the same with her own family.", "NTA, there's 0% risk his ears hurt, physically. That's just facts, you can't make that loud sound unless you scream right into his ears, and even then it would just be slight discomfort.\n\nSo, it's all in his brain. He's the one being bothered by your voice, he needs to adapt. Frankly, I'd dump anyone criticising my culture, that's a huge red flag.", "NTA \n\nIt seems like everyone who is in her close circle is fine with her being loud and are most likely loud themselves. \n\nI come from a culture where being loud/louder is the norm and having outsiders judging the way we communicate with one another is the greatest AH move. \n\nIf there's a 20 people and there is only a loud one, then yes, you should tone down your voice, but if everyone's loud and you're the only person being policed then I'm sorry but it's their problem, they can easily wear earplugs or leave the room for an event. \n\nTo be fair it seems here that OP DOES IN FACT accommodate/is willing to accommodate the husband when they are with his family or friends, so why shouldn't the husband accomodate OP when she's with her family or friends?", "Of course YTA. Your actually causing someone physical pain. You don\u2019t need to be obnoxiously loud anywhere. Doesn\u2019t matter what ethnicity u are manners are still important", "YTA. You're going to end up single before too long if moderating your volume to improve your partner's comfort is too much to ask.", "YTA. How hard is it to be a bit quieter for your husband's comfort?", "Definitely NTA.  I feel like all of the Y T A votes are from people who don't truly understand the reason why you added that you are Latina.  My mom is the same way; usually quiet and reserved but put her in a room with her sisters and no one's ear drums are safe.\n\nYour husband might be realizing you aren't that loud and vocal with his family and sees it that you aren't as happy around them.

You asked him what bothered him.  He answered. How is he being unreasonable by answering a question?  How is he supposed to know exactly when to leave a room in order to avoid severe discomfort?  Is he psychic?  Is he in situations where he can leave the room when you're getting shrieky without appearing like he's being rude to your family? It bothers him, he told you.  He's not the one being unreasonable. Earplugs, as was suggested, would prevent him from hearing people speaking normally.  Would he be upset if you excluded him from some of your family plans?

My fiancee's sister, mom, and friends are the loudest people I've ever been around it and makes me wildly uncomfortable. The first time we went out for food together was the last. I told my fiancee, \"I will not be around people who are that loud and obnoxious, especially in public\". She understands this and I basically don't attend most family functions for this reason, but only if we are in public. If we are in their home, I suck it up and deal because they're in the confines of their own space.

If he has alternative options, and is choosing to be controlling of a space that isn't his then he is the problem here.", "Doesn\u2019t mean your loudness doesn\u2019t physically hurt ears though. I\u2019ve experienced it, esp when there\u2019s a few tias around. Y\u2019all have your fun but idk I feel like if u care about him, you should try to be conscious of ur volume", "OP provided her personal background growing up. It makes sense for her to be loud, hence her using the stereotype.", "Frankly it\u2019s not about being Latino but more about your social and economic background. \nIf you live in Latin America you know different countries have different accents and speed of speech. And no being \u201cloud\u201d\u2019is not a common thing.", "Definition: an often unfair and untrue belief that many people have about all people or things with a particular characteristic. It's not a stereotype because it's true. It doesn't apply to 100% of the latino population but it is a generalization. It is not a stereotype if it's true.", "Does he still count as an outsider after ten years?", "OP's friends and family are the same ... this isn't about inside/outside .. this is cultural only.  It also sounds a bit controlling given that other loud voices don't bother him ... just hers.", "This right here. My wife's Italian and when she gets together with her family it's chaos. To a point where my 5 year old starts screaming stop yelling at each other because he thinks they are fighting  and gets upset. Try explaining to a 5 year old that's been told to use his inside voice a million times that they're just yelling because they love each other lol.\n\nChange husband to kid in the OP's post and this vote goes a whole other way. YTA.", "Yeah, im on hubby\u2019s side. I would find that incredibly annoying.", "Annoying to you. Whereas people that are easily bothered and constantly trying to control the actions of a whole room of people that don\u2019t have that same preferences and needs - very annoying to me. Empathy works both ways.", "Given that he says he has no problem with anyone else being loud, including her notoriously loud aunt, it isn't just a volume issue. He only has a problem with *her* being loud, and specifically only when she's happy or excited around her family.", "The argument should be if she cares about her man or not, but if she\u2019s more concerned with being right than being married, bully for her!! Couldn\u2019t be me.", "Italian here, I was just thinking that lmao", "Oh stop.", "Actually Loud is me, I\u2019m not intentionally loud all the time. I honestly can\u2019t help it when I get super excited/happy/overjoyed.", "It\u2019s a common stereotype. Very common. Even if it\u2019s true that markets can be loud in Latin countries, it\u2019s also true that in non Latin countries people in markets are loud. Still does not mean that it\u2019s a not stereotype. I grew up surrounded like many other latinos, with other latinos! Yes parties can be loud. But when 1 individual is being loud on a daily basis, in their everyday life. It\u2019s not \u201cI\u2019m Latino so I\u2019m loud\u201d. It\u2019s just \u201cI\u2019m a loud person\u201d. \n\nPeople who say that \u201cI\u2019m loud cause I\u2019m Latino\u201d are using it as a poor excuse to not change. Im not saying you have to but don\u2019t use that excuse.\n\nEdit: spelling", "I\u2019m a latina, borned and raised in latam and people like you are obnoxious as hell and feed into harmful stereotypes. \u201cLoud latina self\u201d, fuck off you are just loud and want to use your culture as an excuse", "That\u2019s not that that definition says. It says \u2018often\u2019 unfair and untrue, which means that there are cases where it *is* true.\n\nOften means \u2018frequently\u2019, not \u2018always\u2019. So by saying \u2018often\u2019 that means that the statement is usually true, but not always.", "To the culture, yes", "Yeah, with those additional details that's exactly what it sounds like is happening. It's only *her* being loud that he has a problem with, because her being loud means she feels happy and free to express it. Dude is an AH.", "My husband sometimes speaks at a volume that really really hurts my ears. I'm very sensitive (neurodivergent) and often very annoyed with sounds, but he really gives the term \"loud\" a new level of meaning, sometimes his voice is killing my ears. Just saying, it's real.", "I have sensory issues from autism but u can also have them without autism. It's possible it hurts his ears.", "Makes me wonder if they are speaking in Spanish and it\u2019s not about the loudness but about being left out? Like if he\u2019s fine at home, but grumpy when she\u2019s with family, that sounds like a him problem and it\u2019s probably not about the loudness. Especially when he says it\u2019s just her voice, not even the people who are louder than her.", "Those loops are lifesavers. They real help my poor sensitive ears with everything", "There\u2019s talking loud and yelling two different things \ud83d\ude44", "He knows she\u2019s loud with her family though. He knows her family is loud. He married her knowing that lol.\n\nOP shouldn\u2019t need to change how she is around family. She\u2019s NTA for being herself.", "Thank you! They really don\u2019t understand. I honestly can\u2019t control my loudness when I\u2019m overly happy and excited. It happens and then I\u2019m like \u201coh shit I was really loud\u201d and I laugh about it, I go \u201coops sorry\u201d and go back to talking normally but excitedly. I don\u2019t do it intentionally to hurt ppls eardrums and OP doesn\u2019t do that either. She\u2019s just being herself with her family.", "I'm an Italian and our whole family is loud. That being said when people have asked me to lower my voice, I do so out of courtesy. Not everyone is as loud as me. Look, OP it's totally okay to be loud but it's equally okay for someone to feel it's too loud. I think YTA and so is your husband. Meet in the middle and compromise somewhere", "She might just have a different (higher? shriller?) pitch than the other people. I get what he is saying; I have experienced people who caused me auditory discomfort before. I also find loud female/high pitched voices a lot more unpleasant than loud male or at least deeper pitched female voices.", "I'm wondering about her pitch. Does the aunt have a big, booming voice and OP have a piercing screech when she gets loud?  Or does he resent her for not considering him when with her own family? It would be helpful to know why the loud aunt doesn't bother him.", "Some pitches just hurt more.", "Even so, there would still be other individuals that would trigger it, not just her voice when it becomes loud. When you have a close family, your mannerisms and way to speak tend to be similar so I doubt it would be limited to just her.", "Vocal pitch can be a strange thing. I once worked with a woman whose vocal pitch was identical to ours voicemail\u2019s cancel command. She had an awful time trying to leave voicemail messages!", "Exactly. My step sister is like that sometimes. When she gets excitable there's this pitch that's just ear piercing even if she doesn't seem particularly loud. Especially when confined in a car and the sound just reverberates back off the windows.\n\nAlso how silly if she thinks it's a volume thing to tell him to leave the room when it's apparently only around her loud friends/family. Surely there are other people I. The rest of the place also being loud? Or does she expect him to become antisocial in someone else's home?", "The husband could compromise by wearing earplugs when he chooses to visit her family with her. She's already not inviting them to her home, and she moderates herself with him and she says he doesn't have to go with her", "She isn't asked a lot. She is asked by one person, and only when she is MOST ENJOYING HERSELF I think he hates her enjoyment not the pitch.", "My husband was raised in an abusive home by a mother who would just \"flip out\" over the most mundane thing.  Everything can be normal and then suddenly she's enraged and screaming.  I've witnessed it.  We've had to work through a lot of his trauma responses together, and one of them is getting triggered when I get really exuberant - I am also loud when I am happy.  We've been together long enough where I recognize what's happening and we talk it out.\n\n I am not saying that's what's happening here of course, but to me his reaction sounds very specific to her, and he's getting triggered by something.  But he needs to express himself and talk about it honestly."]}
