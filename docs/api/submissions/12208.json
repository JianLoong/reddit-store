Do you also get loud when you're excited around him?\n\nYTA. Whenever I've heard someone use the excuse \"I'm Latina, we're just loud\" they're using the race/culture card to deflect moderating their volume depending on where they are (and they're usually loud as fuck, even for someone who's used to passionate talking/conversations). Coming from a mixed ethnicity family, you can find a middle ground.\n\nIt sounds like everyone else isn't being extremely loud because he isn't asking anyone else to tone it down. How does the rest of your family react to his requests?\n\nYou can be yourself without yelling all the time. Read the room and stop trying to spin this as \"my partner doesn't respect me for who I am.\"", "YTA.

I think to shut his request down immediately might not help you in the long run. Maybe have a conversation about it. Are you also louder than anyone else in you family/friend get-togethers? Because he says only you not the whole \"situation\". So, try to reduce the volume maybe a bit?", "NTA. He shouldn't have married you if it was a problem. You're willing to be quite at sometimes and not quiet at others. Leaving the room is an option for him, he can adjust himself to accommodate his own needs. Especially if you're quiet most of the time out of consideration to him. He can leave the room to allow you time to be yourself in your own home from time to time to accommodate you.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA. I\u2019m also Latina (Mexican) and my mom does this. She talks really loud and is always borderline yelling even when she is just talking because she says she just \u201ctalks like that\u201d even though she doesn\u2019t as she doesn\u2019t speak to other people this way. It\u2019s really annoying and it hurts my head and causes my ears to ring constantly which really sucks. I think that you are kinda dismissing your partners feelings a bit here.\n\nEDIT: It\u2019s also a bit odd to excuse your actions by feeding into the \u201cloud Latina\u201d stereotype.", "**YTA**\n\nFirst of all, anytime you tell someone who is asking you nicely to please stop doing something COMPLETELY UNNNECESSARY that is causing them actual pain to \"suck it up\", because you can't be arsed to be thoughtful, you're very clearly being an AH. That's literally like, the definition of being an asshole: being so self-absorbed that you could change something small to help someone and you won't simply because you don't feel like it, even though it really wouldn't affect you meaningfully at all.\n\nSecondly, YTA for perpetuating a gross trope about your own people. Your whole \"I can't help being loud, I'm Latina\" is beyond offensive . . . there's nothing worse than people who perpetuate ugly stereotypes about their own people and try to pass them off as their whole personality. I have plenty of Latino/a family members and dear friends from multiple Central and South American countries, who just like any other group of people have a variety of different personalities. Hilariously, a good number are gentle, quiet, and work in the caring professions. So your whole, \"he can't ask me to be quiet - I'm Latina, being loud and obnoxious is genetic for me!\" is just gross. And for the record, I'm saying this as someone whose ethnic group has similar stereotypes, and I find it just as obnoxious when I see women of my culture leaning into them. \n\nBut mostly YTA because you sound like you don't even LIKE your husband. You literally married this man, made vows to him, are supposed to be partners in life. He is telling you that you are CAUSING HIM PAIN, and your response is . . . \"suck it up or get lost, I'm having fun\"?\n\nI don't understand the N-T-As here at all. All these people saying he should get earplugs or noise reducing headphones or whatever . . . literally anything other than his own wife and her family just BEING SLIGHTLY MORE THOUGHTFUL and slightly less shrieky.

Your husband has an equal ability to yours to set the rules of the home when guests are visting, regardless of your relation to them. Yes, I'm well aware he's criticizing you and not the family guests, but it's his home, too, and you should work together to have the best environment possible for both of you in the home. That may entail him leaving the home for a bit, sure. If, however, he is the guest in someone else's home, he does not have a say in the matter of normal conduct.", "NTA. You are insistent this is an important part of who you are. He is insistent he can't handle it. The answer here seems obvious. How can you have a future with someone who can't stand who you are?

If he has a problem with the noise then he should leave the room or wear ear plugs.", "Hmmm idk I get loud and excited when I\u2019m happy to! My ex used to try and shut me down when I\u2019m just expressing myself being happy & tbh that would hurt me a lot.

My entire family gets LOUD when we\u2019re together. It doesn\u2019t make sense for OP\u2019s partner to tell her to be more quiet when he\u2019s the only one with the issue. And OP says she\u2019s already quiet around his family AND when they\u2019re alone so there\u2019s no reason for her to do the same with her own family.", "NTA, there's 0% risk his ears hurt, physically. That's just facts, you can't make that loud sound unless you scream right into his ears, and even then it would just be slight discomfort.\n\nSo, it's all in his brain. He's the one being bothered by your voice, he needs to adapt. Frankly, I'd dump anyone criticising my culture, that's a huge red flag.", "NTA \n\nIt seems like everyone who is in her close circle is fine with her being loud and are most likely loud themselves. \n\nI come from a culture where being loud/louder is the norm and having outsiders judging the way we communicate with one another is the greatest AH move. \n\nIf there's a 20 people and there is only a loud one, then yes, you should tone down your voice, but if everyone's loud and you're the only person being policed then I'm sorry but it's their problem, they can easily wear earplugs or leave the room for an event. \n\nTo be fair it seems here that OP DOES IN FACT accommodate/is willing to accommodate the husband when they are with his family or friends, so why shouldn't the husband accomodate OP when she's with her family or friends?", "Of course YTA. Your actually causing someone physical pain. You don\u2019t need to be obnoxiously loud anywhere. Doesn\u2019t matter what ethnicity u are manners are still important", "YTA.

How hard is it to be a bit quieter for your husband's comfort?", "Definitely NTA.  I feel like all of the Y T A votes are from people who don't truly understand the reason why you added that you are Latina.  My mom is the same way; usually quiet and reserved but put her in a room with her sisters and no one's ear drums are safe.\n\nYour husband might be realizing you aren't that loud and vocal with his family and sees it that you aren't as happy around them.  Either way, you need to be you!", "NTA if you're already compromising being quieter around him and his family. I think you should be allowed to be yourself when you're around your family.", "YTA.

Maybe he thought he could handle it but as the years have passed, he realized he couldn\u2019t and while breaking up is an extreme measure that might what needs to happen. You shouldn\u2019t be with someone who can\u2019t be your authentic self with.", "NTA. If your partner has a sensory issue with loud noises, he needs to manage it.

You asked him what bothered him.  He answered. How is he being unreasonable by answering a question?  How is he supposed to know exactly when to leave a room in order to avoid severe discomfort?  Is he psychic?  Is he in situations where he can leave the room when you're getting shrieky without appearing like he's being rude to your family? It bothers him, he told you.  He's not the one being unreasonable. Earplugs, as was suggested, would prevent him from hearing people speaking normally.  Would he be upset if you excluded him from some of your family plans?

My fiancee's sister, mom, and friends are the loudest people I've ever been around it and makes me wildly uncomfortable. The first time we went out for food together was the last. I told my fiancee, \"I will not be around people who are that loud and obnoxious, especially in public\". She understands this and I basically don't attend most family functions for this reason, but only if we are in public. If we are in their home, I suck it up and deal because they're in the confines of their own space.

I do reiterate it is how I naturally show very positive emotions so it will happen fairly often in our lifetime together and he gets it.
