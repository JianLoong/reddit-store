{"id": 665, "submission_id": "yfkto8", "title": "AITA for offering to pay to send my niece to boarding school?", "selftext": "I have a daughter, Luisa (10), and my brother Charlie has a daughter, Sophie (11) (same school year). The girls have always been close, even though we moved abroad 3 years ago, so we have had Sophie come and stay with us during school holidays very often, and the girls keep in touch over social media.\n\nSome context to this is that my brother and I come from a middle class family, both of us attended private schools, regular abroad holidays as children, \"expensive\" hobbies, etc. Charlie's wife Rebecca does not come from a similar background and this has caused some awkward moments in the past, nothing malicious, just faux pas's. Charlie also chose a career path which has meant that he has not been able to maintain the standard of living we grew up with, or provide that for Sophie. This has been a point of contention between him and his parents.\n\nNext September, Luisa will be going to boarding school (before I get bashed in the comments, this was entirely her idea, not something we wanted for her, but it is where most of her friends from her junior school will be going, and they do not allow day pupils. The school is 1 hour from where we live and Luisa will be able to come home on weekends). I gather that Luisa and Sophie spoke about the idea of going to school together and got very excited. I told Luisa this is something that Charlie and Rebecca would have to decide, and then spoke to Charlie about it. I said that if it was something he wanted for Sophie, me and my husband could pay for Sophie to go, and be her point of contact during term time. Charlie was almost in tears thanking me, and said this is something he and Rebecca could only dream of for Sophie. Over the next couple of days, I spoke to our parents about this, as when I called I found out that he had already mentioned it, and they were overjoyed.\n\nYesterday, I got a series of vitriolic messages from Rebecca, accusing me of trying to 'steal' and 'adopt her daughter'. She accused me and our whole family of using money to manipulate her daughter into hating her. She called me every name under the sun and said that I was trying to push her out of being a mother to Sophie. None of this made any sense to me, I love Sophie dearly but I've never tried to be her mother, and this idea was Sophie and Luisa's. I was very hurt by the things she implied about me and my family and didn't even reply to her, but I did forward the messages to Charlie.\n\nI didn't think I had any part to play in Rebecca's outburst, but I spoke to my husband about this and he said he sees how Rebecca could be upset, because when Sophie is around it's obvious how much she looks up to me and wishes she had what Luisa does. He also said that while he loves that my family wants the best for all of us, he could see how it could feel a bit oppressive if you couldn't meet the standard. My husband NEVER says things like this, so since that conversation I've been wondering, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I'm getting a lot of questions about the 'point of contact' thing so thought I would clarify. Because the school is in the country I live in, and not where Charlie and Rebecca live, I offered to be the emergency contact in case Sophie was ill or needed picking up from school immediately, etc. Also, in case she wanted to come home with Luisa at weekends and not be at school, since she won't be able to fly home every weekend. I said it to ease their minds that at least she would have someone in the vicinity at short notice, not that I would be responsible for her academic progress or anything like that.\n\nEDIT 2: Re 'Middle class', I really didn't think was going to be as big as it is, but in the UK (or at least, where I'm from in the UK), everyone calls themselves 'middle class' unless you belong to the upper social echelons which you can only enter by birth or by marriage (or unless you are working class but that's not part of this distinction). If you're not 'nobility', you're middle class. Some people say 'upper middle class' which perhaps I should have but it seemed like a pointless distinction. I'm not trying to downplay that we had a privileged upbringing, it's just in my experience 'upper class' is not purely about money.\n\nEDIT 3: I have seen the similar post. I cannot say for sure that it wasn't written by Rebecca but that is absolute NOT how the offer was broached to her, and if that is her she has conflated several conversations over the course of over a year to concoct that version of events.", "created_utc": 1666954045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yfkto8/aita_for_offering_to_pay_to_send_my_niece_to/", "score": 4806, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP'S daughter brought up going to the boarding school.  Then OP's daughter and niece  talked about both going.   Then OP talked to the brother about it and said that he should talk to his wife about it, which he did, and then the brother's wife flipped out.   At no point did OP try and steal away her brother's daughter and the brother was delighted that his daughter would get to experience something that he did as a child, but couldn't afford to give her the same opportunity.", "You're NTA.  A simple \"no thank you,  we want out middle school age daughter to attend school in our own country so we can still see her every day\" would have been a sufficient answer. But there's probably something much deeper here than this offer for Rebecca to react so angrily.", "NTA, you made a extremely kind offer. Your brother should have consulted his wife in the matter though. Your brother not communicating with his wife is not your fault.", "[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x81am5/wibta\\_for\\_refusing\\_to\\_send\\_my\\_daughter\\_away\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x81am5/wibta_for_refusing_to_send_my_daughter_away_for/)\n\nI wonder if this is the mother of her niece. It was posted about a month ago.", "NTA, maybe a little taboo, but it sounds like you are close with your brother so it shouldn't be that big of a deal.  That said, this type of outburst from Rebecca seems so over the top that I'm wondering if it was a 'straw that broke the camel's back' situation?  Maybe Sophie has been saying things at the house that makes her feel inadequate as a mother?  I can only imagine how awful that would be to hear, especially if it was something I was already insecure about.\n\n For the family's sake I would have a talk with her and specifically address some of the comments she made (ie  that you were trying to push her out of being a mother to Sophie) to reassure her that that was not your intention.  Hope everything works out", "NTA but your brother is. He\u2019s sitting there crying and thanking you like it\u2019s a done deal before talking to his wife, who clearly has very different parenting values. And she\u2019s not crazy - how many parents not only want to send their children to boarding school but to one that\u2019s in another country so they can\u2019t even see them on the weekends? \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have taken this out on you instead of her husband, but she\u2019s not wrong to be angry.", "NTA  I don't think you overstepped - you offered to Charlie some options and financial help if they decide to send their daughter to the school.  That was it, right?  You didn't tell the kid she could go?  So the problem is really between Charlie and Rebecca, who need to be in agreement on something as major as sending their 10 year old kid to another country for boarding school.", "NTA you made a generous suggestion that your brother was happy and grateful for, he should have shared the news with his wife and got her opinion before giving you an answer and telling your parents.\n\nI mean I get the outburst you did suggest their daughter move to your country HOWEVER you didn\u2019t do it maliciously and if they were not interested they could have politely declined, you made a suggestion not demand. His wife seems jealous based on your POV because her daughter idolises you and the life you provide for your child. \n\nWhy is everyone focused on the kid going to boarding school so young? OP has said her daughter wants to go that school and she\u2019s spoken to child psychologists before agreeing. She won\u2019t be the first kid to go, definitely not the last. I", "NAH. It was very generous of you to offer this and you have the best intentions. \n\nBut I sympathize with Rebecca as a mother and can\u2019t imagine sending my children away that young and basically never seeing them. I understand it\u2019s more common in the UK, but I would panic over their safety and emotional health at such a vulnerable age. To essentially not have a say in that scenario would devastate me.\n\nYou and your brother should have made sure Rebecca was on board before telling others, because now she can\u2019t say no without harming her relationship with her daughter.", "OP - you are NTA. You weren\u2019t to know the reaction from your brothers wife. It was perfectly reasonable to make the offer to your sibling and then allow him and his spouse to make a decision.\n\nHer reaction is unhinged, all she had to say was \u201cNo thank you\u201d if she was uncomfortable with the idea. You made a generous offer for the benefit of your niece and should not in any way feel bad about that.\n\nIf the girl\u2019s mother cannot see the advantages that a private education could bring her daughter then she is short sighted and selfish.\n\nYour under no obligation but make I would let your brother know the offer remains on the table if she gets her head out of her ass.", "NTA \n\nIt was an offer only made through Charlie but for the consideration of both parents, he should have the responsibiltiy to discuss it with his wife, then with child after. They can always decline the offer. \n\nTalk to her in person as well to let her know you just mean well for Sophie and you're all there as a family to help each other, like you're sure they'd do the same for Luisa if shoes were the other way on and that of course her decision as parent will always matter most. Be understanding, loving and reassuring because, at the end of the day, it is for a niece you love.\n\nMore than the school issue, it would be nice of you to have chats or lunches with your SIL, anything to involve her more into your life or family dynamics, to help her know her insecurities are unfounded as she obviously feels off and unincluded in certain ways... that's if you actually like her as a person.", "ehh idk. nta i guess?\n\nbut fyi your family was not middle class, and neither are you...", "NTA (OR NAH) I think that is a very generous offer and very good of you to do but I am pretty appalled that Rebecca was not part of this conversation. It sounds like no one is listening to her and what she wants for HER child.  I am not sure where her anger is stemming from...the money or her daughter moving out or both. I'm a raging Anglophile but the boarding school culture in the UK is something I am just not a fan of. I would lose my mind to have my 11-year-old gone M-F. Just a hard, hard NO. ESPECIALLY if my husband just agreed to it and told everyone without my 100% approval on it all.\n\nI don't fault Rebecca for her reaction. Money is HARD to compete with, especially when it comes to kids. What kid WOULDN'T prefer to hang with the family that has everything? I don't think you intended this but I can also see why Rebecca is struggling with it. Just be really mindful of it as you go forward.", "NAH - boarding school for people who are used to it can be great, but a lot of people opt against it because they are concerned about the effects of separating the family on both the children and the parents.\n\nIt seems like your brother is very grateful and overwhelmed by your generous offer, but didn't speak to his wife about it in quite the right way - both he and your parents seem to have assumed that the only barrier here was the lack of money for the fees, which makes his wife feel both blamed and completely left out of the decisionmaking process.\n\nIt would be very different if they'd talked about this from when their daughter was much younger (usually around age 6 or 7 is when these sorts of decisions tend to be discussed, as being in the right primary school or having a tutor from that young tends to be a factor in whether you can get into that type of school) but it seems like in light of their economic situation your brother and his wife had very different expectations for this that they haven't discussed. That's a mistake, for sure, but not one that really makes either of them assholes - it's just a cultural difference which comes from them being from different backgrounds.\n\nWhilst it wasn't very fair of her to turn all the blame on you, your SIL is understandably upset that the entire family seems to assume that she wants to be separated from her daughter for whole terms at a time, and that during that time you have offered to be a surrogate parent - it's a generous offer, but nobody seems to have really asked her about any of it. And i would strongly suspect that you offering to make the funding available (meaning you had at minimum discussed it with your own husband and your brother) before discussing whether it was what was best \\*with the child's mother\\* would make it seem exactly like the conspiracy she's describing, from her perspective, especially if she knows about the psychological evaluations and school visits etc you've had done with your own daughter that she has not had the opportunity to go through with hers. Her experience of the place she'd potentially be trusting her child to for about six or seven years will amount to maybe one visit and your second-hand opinion.\n\nAnd additionally to all of that: she knows her child best and knows how her child will find the reality of being away from home for so long, even if she's got her cousin and auntie nearby. If she doesn't believe her kid will thrive in that situation, then she's the only one willing or able to step up and be the bad guy by making that decision on her daughter's behalf, even if she knows it's the best thing to do in the end. So there's not much way for her to object to this without her husband and/or her child being furious with her. I'm not surprised she's angry!", "TBF, I wouldn't want my child going to a boarding school in a different country, where I wouldn't even get to see her when she comes \"home\" on weekends either.\n\nWhen is your SIL supposed to see her child again? She will either be at school or with you for most of tge year, and I can absolutely understand her perspective here. Especially since she did not grow up with these \"opportunities\" and her husband didn't even bother to speak to her before accepting your offer. The poor woman probably feels forced into a corner here.", "Your brother is the AH", "NTA for offering at all. The decision should be up to her parents. And if they can\u2019t agree on a decision together, then you\u2019re still NTA.", "NTA. Your SIL's feeling are misplaced, but in a way they are valid. Her daughter will be going to another country and she will not be able to see her even on weekends. Despite it not being the case, it may very well feel like she is losing her daughter to you since you are close by and can readily see her. You are still offering your extended family an amazing opportunity and I don't believe there was any malicious intent. The way your SIL reacted towards you was inappropriate/awful and again likely misplaced. You have been incredibly generous already, but my suggestions is that you extend an olive branch. If you could financially help with sending Sophie back home to her parents on holiday or long weekends, her mother may feel reassured by the scheduled time with her daughter and this threatened motherhood feeling may gradually resolve. \n\n\nTangential point: It's worth considering how Sophie will feel at this boarding school. Eventhough Sophie will have your daughter, children are cruel and the experience can be extremely isolating. Classism and discrimination are not things a 10 year old would consider or even fathom, but I'm sure you can understand this perspective. Ponder a bit about how you view your brother's wife and how she fits in with your family. I attended a prestigious academic institution and it opened up many opportunities for me later in life. However, I wished someone had prepared me for the social environment I was entering. Getting bullied for the shoes I wore, my father being a teacher, or for the fact that I was a \"scholarship kid\" was incredibly difficult and depressing. It's a harsh reality.", "NTA for your offer. \nI do think you should contact your  SIL and plan an appointment for a good conversation.\nWould be best in person, but since you live in different countries maybe through a video call.\n\nSomewhere between how you meant the offer and her interpretation of it there is a huge difference. Wouldn't surprise me if there is a lot underlying problems you don't even realize.\n\nHopefully a good and open conversation with your SIL will help all of you", "Well, maybe as I'm not a mother i don't really understand most of the conflict, but i was thinking... This kind of school would offer the child better opportunities in life, right? I want to believe I'd try to suck it up, if it would mean better opportunities for my child.\n\nEdit. After reading all your comments I've realized it's a good thing I'm not a mother \ud83e\udd23... #okno\n\nJokes apart it's been interesting to see how naive I'm about this stuff. Thanks for your comments. :)", "NTA and jeez, y'all, calm down about the middle class stuff.\n\nYour SIL is clearly having some issues with the situation that are coming out in toxic ways. You all need to get on the phone together to talk.", "You\u2019re NTA for offering, but you\u2019re very slightly the AH for the manner in which things came about. When you heard the two girls talking, before talking to anyone else, you should have sat down with your brother AND his wife and made the offer, in quiet without bringing anyone else into such a delicate conversation. The fact that you discussed this with your parents before discussing it with Rebecca makes this\u2026 awkward. Your brother, definitely an AH for talking about it with your parents before really sitting down and talking it through with his wife. \nRebecca may also slightly be an AH for the extremity of her reaction, but you had the chance to staunch this fire in the first place. While I get that you were trying to do a nice thing, it backfired. Imagine it from Rebecca\u2019s POV\u2026 her 11yo daughter now wants to leave her own country to go away to boarding school, and she (Rebecca) will be the \u201cevil mom\u201d for refusing this opportunity because Rebecca wants to be physically there for her as a parent as she\u2019s growing up. Think of all the milestones Rebecca would miss out on having with her daughter because she\u2019s in a different country. \n\nAgain, you were seeking to do a kind and altruistic thing\u2026 but both you and your brother made some missteps here, and Rebecca has been put in a painfully awkward spot with her daughter because of it.", "NTA based on your post, your intentions and suggestions seem pure and not offensive at all. however based on your SILs reply, it seems that other problems have arisen based around money in the past, at least on her side. i still think what you offered was kind, and you did not deserve to be bashed like that. I think it would be a good idea to reach out to your SIL and discuss what she\u2019s feeling and why.", "When you mention \"other country\", do you mean Scotland Vs England? Lots of people seem to think France Vs USA here...\n\nAnyway NTA - it's up to your brother to discuss this with his wife", "NTA. At no point we\u2019re you pressuring anybody. You simply made an offer. Charlie sounds like he might be a lousy husband for not communicating/handling the situation well, but that\u2019s not your fault.", "NAH the two kids wanted to go and you wanted to help. I get that but like your husband I also shee how your SIL probably feels like she can never \"win\" because she can never provide what you can. When you come to the rescue you're the \"hero\" and the mom isnt good enough.", "Why are so many people confused about the class comment.\n\nI'm from Canada and since we have no royalty our class system is mostly bassed on money, however when I read her post, I clearly understood that her definition of middle class was much more priveliged then mine.\n\nBoarding school and living in diferent countries but frequent visits made me think Europe.\n\nBTW NTA and it sounds like SIL has some missplaced anger but I do underatand her not wanting her baby to be away for so long.", "NTA for the offer.  I do think not talking to mom was the wrong move.  She is after all the child\u2019s mom and she\u2019s basically been ignore.  While there may or may be a basis for her feeling I can see why she has them.  \n\nI can\u2019t say that in these circumstances I would react emotionally too.\n\nYes it\u2019s an wonderful offer and opportunity.  But it also means that a her daughter will essentially be living in a different country away from her mother who will only see her on holidays, assuming parents have the money to fly her out.  This kind of education might be normal in the world you grew up in, but for the vast majority of the world this is not the norm.  I personally would not send my child to boarding school at 11. \n\nYTA   Your lack of response to your SIL essentially exacerbated the situation.  She felt like her daughter was being taken from her.  Yes, that was not your intent, but that doesn\u2019t mean her feelings aren\u2019t worthy of a compassionate response from you.   You could have done a lot of things to allay her concerns, none of which you did.  You could have reached out to her mother to mother and reassured her. She\u2019s essentially been removed from any decisions regarding to her daughter and made to feel petty for her concerns.  You may find her response ridiculous but they are her feelings and she is entitled to them.", "NTA\n\nBut it kind of sounds like your brother made this decision without actually asking his wife. If I were in her shoes and I was being *told* that my child would be living abroad for months at a time, I\u2019d be pretty angry. She shouldn\u2019t have taken it out on you though.\n\nI\u2019d go and try to talk to her one on one. Say something like you don\u2019t want to take her daughter from her and that if she is uncomfortable with this, then you won\u2019t go through with it. Two yes or one no. If she\u2019s not comfortable then it\u2019s not happening even if Charlie and Sophie want it to, and it\u2019s not up to you to try and change her mind either.", "NTA.  I see a lot of comments here making assumptions about your opinion of Rebecca but all I see is context to give the broader picture.  I understand from her POV that maybe she's in an awkward position, having a whole side of the family that thinks she should let her daughter go to boarding school in another country when she (understandably) wants to keep her at home. I can also see how that could lead to her lashing out at you, who made the offer, even though that's misplaced anger.  It's a tough situation for her to be in, but no one is at fault for it.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA necessarily. You\u2019ve made an offer but did you consider what that would mean for your SIL who resides in a different country to this school? \nYou get to see your daughter every weekend. When will your nice see her parents? I would probably react the same way to be honest if I felt my daughter was being whisked away with little consultation from me.\nThere runs a very real risk that your SIL will become alienated from her daughter. She cannot help not being minted. This does bot automatically make her a sub par mum and I can fully understand her emotional outburst. She\u2019s being pushed aside because you lot can throw money at a situation and you have not considered this from all angles. \nYour description of her is quite telling as well (faux pas?!)  and I detect your disdain for her that is likely rooted in class snobbery.\n\nMoney does not make you the better person or parent. Money and an amazing education does not guarantee happiness.", "NTA - I can see you were thinking about your niece and it is very lovely that you would like to do this for her. \nHowever, perhaps it would have been better to have all discussed it together. \nIt sounds like you have all made this decision and excluded Rebecca. \nWhether it was intentional or not. \nIt is very generous f you but perhaps Rebecca can feel insecure about the difference in wealth. \nThe bottom line was, it didn\u2019t occur for anyone to appear to involve Rebecca in any of this.", "You\u2019re not a middle class family. You were rich. Still are. Your brother should have talked to his wife about this before agreeing and honestly you should have had both of them on the phone. Your brother doesn\u2019t get to make the decision on this fully.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get all these Y t a. Your SIL has really overreacted here. There is obviously some insecurity issues going on instead of this being the main problem. You only bringing this up to your brother is legitimate as you would assume he would discuss it with his wife first, that is not on you, anyone would assume the same.\n\nAnd if no one\u2019s else is gonna say it I will. SIL is selfish, this is something her daughter wants, something her husband and his family wants and whilst her opinion should be respected, she can not dictate everything herself. Simply put, she is outnumbered and to deny her daughter an amazing opportunity due to her own insecurity is disgusting and selfish, so NTA and you are extremely kind to even offer in the first place as these schools are extremely expensive. \n\nPlus, for everyone bashing op for her middle class term, it\u2019s commonly used in the UK, literally everyone uses the terms: working class, middle class, upper class and nobility. It\u2019s normal, just because you don\u2019t know something dose not mean you can bash someone else for knowing it.", "as someone who was sent to boarding school ( i lived in war zones it seemed necessary at the time ) i wouldnt recommend it to ANYONE there is a huge part of emotional learning that needs to be done when you are a teenager and i find as a consequence i may have been emotionally stunted as a consequence also im a free spirit i couldnt deal with all the senseless rules so i suffered trauma from it   \nfor context if you look at he british government and you wonder how can people who are so out of touch with reality be in charge of a country .... well that is boarding school for you", "NTA exactly but I think you\u2019ve been a bit thoughtless about the impact this could have. It\u2019s not just the fees your brother can\u2019t afford, it\u2019s the whole lifestyle that is available to kids who\u2019s parents can send them to boarding school. Is she going to be able to \u201ckeep up\u201d with peers who can do the extracurriculars, the trips, the jet set holidays? Will she be comfortable inviting her friends to her home? How is putting her in an environment where she\u2019s going to be exposed to a \u201cmoney\u2019s no object\u201d group going to impact on her relationship her mum and dad?  At some point the gap between her and the rich kids is going to be exposed, and that she\u2019s going to resent her parents accordingly.  \n\nYour parents have made it apparent that they don\u2019t approve of your brother\u2019s choices, and you sound like you look down on your SIL. Your brother is most at fault for saying yes, and should have consulted properly with your SIL, but I think you were a bit naive not to realise that this could cause problems given the big imbalance in your financial positions.", "Some people don't want their kids leaving home at 11 years old. They isn't the norm for normal people, which you are not. Your niece would be going to a school where everyone else is from a completely different background and may not be able to relate to them. \n\nI guess it's a nice offer, but you need to realize not everyone is comfortable sending their kids off so young, and that's a completely valid opinion.", "> this has caused some awkward moments in the past, nothing malicious, just faux pas's.\n\nWhy do I get the feeling that there is more to this? Is it possible that from Rebecca's POV this means a history of mocking her \"lower class\" upbringing and treating her like some sort of country bumpkin?", "You weren't an asshole but you were pretty tactless. You don't know how it feels to be the poorer person who has to take monetary gifts or risk their kid losing out. Giving a lot of money to people (or something worth a lot of money like this) is very generous but not straightforward. It could come across as patronising. I think it would have been better to sit down with Charlie and Rebecca and explain what you've heard the girls saying and make the offer that way, or send them an email with that info. Even so, you risk causing offense like you did this time. It's obvious to me your intentions were good - you just want the best for your daughter and neice - but I also see why rebecca acted the way she did. So, NAH.", "An aside note - I really don\u2019t understand all the comments saying along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re the adult, stop saying it\u2019s a 10 year old\u2019s choice\u201d. Child wants to go to the school, parents can afford it, are letting child go to the school of her choice. They\u2019re not shipping her off against her will, and I\u2019m fairly sure they\u2019d send her to a different school if she didn\u2019t like it.\n\nI can see why SIL is upset, I rather think she\u2019s lashing out at OP because it\u2019s easier than husband. You\u2019re NTA for offering, but I can see why Sophie\u2019s mother would be unhappy about this. Perhaps worth all getting together and having a calm conversation about the whole thing - but fair warning, from some of your wording, I can see why SIL feels like you talk down to her/are a bit snobby (the fact you reference she\u2019s not from the same \u201cbackground\u201d which has lead to some faux pas)", "NTA.  Your offer to their daughter was vet generous. If Rebecca disagrees with letting her daughter go...This is between Charlie & Rebecca.

The girls have always been close, even though we moved abroad 3 years ago, so we have had Sophie come and stay with us during school holidays very often, and the girls keep in touch over social media. \n\nSome context to this is that my brother and I come from a middle class family, both of us attended private schools, regular abroad holidays as children, \"expensive\" hobbies, etc. Charlie's wife Rebecca does not come from a similar background and this has caused some awkward moments in the past, nothing malicious, just faux pas's. Charlie also chose a career path which has meant that he has not been able to maintain the standard of living we grew up with, or provide that for Sophie. This has been a point of contention between him and his parents.\n\nNext September, Luisa will be going to boarding school (before I get bashed in the comments, this was entirely her idea, not something we wanted for her, but it is where most of her friends from her junior school will be going, and they do not allow day pupils. The school is 1 hour from where we live and Luisa will be able to come home on weekends). I gather that Luisa and Sophie spoke about the idea of going to school together and got very excited. I told Luisa this is something that Charlie and Rebecca would have to decide, and then spoke to Charlie about it. I said that if it was something he wanted for Sophie, me and my husband could pay for Sophie to go, and be her point of contact during term time. Charlie was almost in tears thanking me, and said this is something he and Rebecca could only dream of for Sophie. Over the next couple of days, I spoke to our parents about this, as when I called I found out that he had already mentioned it, and they were overjoyed.\n\nYesterday, I got a series of vitriolic messages from Rebecca, accusing me of trying to 'steal' and 'adopt her daughter'. She accused me and our whole family of using money to manipulate her daughter into hating her. She called me every name under the sun and said that I was trying to push her out of being a mother to Sophie. None of this made any sense to me, I love Sophie dearly but I've never tried to be her mother, and this idea was Sophie and Luisa's. I was very hurt by the things she implied about me and my family and didn't even reply to her, but I did forward the messages to Charlie.\n\nI didn't think I had any part to play in Rebecca's outburst, but I spoke to my husband about this and he said he sees how Rebecca could be upset, because when Sophie is around it's obvious how much she looks up to me and wishes she had what Luisa does. He also said that while he loves that my family wants the best for all of us, he could see how it could feel a bit oppressive if you couldn't meet the standard. My husband NEVER says things like this, so since that conversation I've been wondering, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We had the resources to do cool experiments in science, go on field trips and get internships that taught us unique skills.  Public schools are fine (mostly- I work with schools now) but the differences are night and day, so much so that if you haven't seen both up close, you might not understand how intense the difference is.

It\u2019s a very nice offer, and maybe they can think it over more when everyone\u2019s emotions settle, but for now, OP poked a hornet\u2019s nest, and the brother\u2019s perspective as someone who did grow up in that privilege is not going to fully line up with Rebecca\u2019s.", "OP may, in fact, be a raging AH, but not for this specific incident.

Most of grade school was in an elite private school (uniforms and all) near Montreal (all politicians, Doctors, riche people of the area send their kids there). At the time (90s) it was entirely ran and administered by French people (from France) so the teachers were all French and so to this day, I can fake a pretty convincing French accent (Quebec accent is different, much like American and British English sounds different). But it wasn't just the accent, it was the whole curriculum (we learned things far above the normal levels of that age group in public schools). By the time we moved in 2000, I was entering my second year of high school (it's 6 years of grade school here, then it's 5 years of high school, I did my first year in another private school in Montreal). Because of location, I had to attend a public school in my neighbourhood which just so happens to be the old part of town where most kids came from low-income families. Don't get me wrong, it was a good school, I made many friends very quickly and when we moved to a very nice part of town 6 months after we first relocated to that city, I begged my mother to keep me in that school with all my new friends. I have nothing against public education, but this is to prove your comment about the vast gap that exists between the two systems. When I started there, they made fun of me.......for being more academically advanced. Teachers would ask me to read out loud more often than the other kids because I read so well (imagine 13 year olds, struggling to put a sentence together, it was painful to watch). These kids, most of them really, they could have all been better equipped and advanced in their learning had they had the same privilege as me. I didn't judge them, I was raised to appreciate the privilege I had growing up so I started a tutoring group to help those who wanted help (the \"bullies\" who made fun of me at the beginning became recuring guests in the group. I even received an award for my initiative). \n\nOP's niece has an opportunity to develop beyond what her parents can offer.

But she should be like my mom, she should see the potential her daughter could benefit from if she only took advantage of that connection to higher education. Whenever you get the opportunity to have help from a rich/fortunate person, take it! Use it! Rise above your circumstances or let your children rise above their circumstances.

Houston area especially is filled with these upper and upper middle class \"rednecks\" who live in McMansions and think that owning a boat and going fishing on the weekends means that they're working class.\n\nMeanwhile, some things that are viewed as \"elite\" are pretty accessible. Like, there's this perception that watching foreign films and listening to classical music are elitist rich people things. But those things aren't expensive at all to access.

Sometimes much more money. But the latter is viewed as a higher class, culturally.\n\nThis whole thing does lead to a lot of confusion because many Americans do define class solely by income.

Some think only aristocrats are upper class, and others judge on wealth, influence and education. \"Aristocrats\" used to be the *top* class with wealth and title(Royal family), upper class would be wealth and highly educated with influence(Sunak), upper middle are wealthy with less political influence but still likely to mingle with higher classe, middle are what most people in poverty dream off (middle management, \"white collar\" jobs, decent pay, being able to afford mortgages, occasional holidays, not going hungry), working would be those who have steady jobs (usually with more manual labor) but they don't pay well enough to have the luxuries of middle class, and \"lower class\" are those in poverty.  \n\nNote: these classes have actually changed naming schemes and they're now ranked with letters A to E, A being the highest in society and E being those who're lesser educated and unemployed/never worked.  \n\nRegardless, for OP to have the sheltered view that *everyone* is middle class unless they have a title shows immense privilege and makes them seem middle upper/upper class.

Are you really that clueless?", "So here's a thing I haven't seen discussed: the social class you grow up in is also essentially a culture you grow up in. Upper middle class people live in a different functional reality to lower middle class people, and working class people live in a whole other reality again. \n\nMore often than not, the people in the two former realities have a disparate ability to shape the realities of the latter. And no one chooses what class they're born into. So often the more upper middle class you are, the more ignorant you are of the wider social footprint people like you have on the world. The more working class you are, the more aware of how other classes do have more control or influence over their and your immediate world but can't comprehend your more 'limited' reality with no such influence or control. You also have to be more aware of middle class and above social etiquette along with your own, because the wrong faux pas in the wrong space or the wrong person will have ripple effects in your personal or professional life. \n\nWith all this in mind, I can't help but feel for your SIL. Comments about more 'well off people' or jokes about 'people never travelling out of the country' work as ways of ensuring everyone is on the same cultural 'page' so the ensuing awkwardness is highlighting that none of you are. And your SIL is always going to be the outsider in this setup. \n\nI want to say NAH, because I really really understand where your SIL is coming from. She's the cultural odd one out and is seeing her daughter, your niece, identifying and integrating more with a culture that she herself lives in but is not part of, and can't relate to. As your niece gets older, she will become more aware of the disparities between here and her cohort in boarding school, which can be deeply alienating when you're a teen. So from your SIL's POV, boarding school is physical distance from her child, but also  cultural and emotional distance from her child.\n\nYou clearly mean well, but your outlook here is also very upper middle class imo. I very much understand the idea of better school = better education = better opportunities = better life. But as someone from a working class background who now moves in a variety of class circles, I know that to engage in that progression to a 'better life', they have to completely give up the cultural identity and outlooks they grew up with to engage and integrate succesfully. This is so painful and so alienating because being working class isn't a personal or societal failing any more than someone's nationality or culture of origin is. The choice to vilify or otherwise look down on working class culture however is, and it being normalized doesn't make it ok.", "yes, you've offered to pay for her schooling but what about spending money, etc, you could help your brother out financially, by helping him secure a better job maybe even in Switzerland, so his wife feels better too, and does not end up resenting you more. \n\nDo you only have one child?", "Complaining about rich people vs rich people looking down on the \\~poors are not anywhere near the same.
