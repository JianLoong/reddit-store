My (45F) mother (71) lives with me and my family but we have a very strained relationship. I try to be as respectful as possible to her but I do not tolerate any of her BS. \n\nFor context: When resolving conflicts in my home we talk it out with the members of the conflict only. For example, if my oldest gets into trouble for something either her father or myself will deal with it privately and not involve other members of the household. \n\nThis is the situation. My oldest daughter (19) has experienced some significant weight loss for reasons unknown (we are currently working with doctors for this issue) and she's become a little self conscious about it. I overheard my mother make a comment to her about how thin she was. I walked into the room and asked my daughter to please go to her room and she did. I then politely told my mother to keep her comments to herself as it is uncomfortable for my daughter. She acted offended but agreed to not say anything.\n\nA couple of weeks later I heard her say something again to my daughter and I again told her not to do that after my daughter left the room. She told me she was just concerned and I said that was fine but if she wants to voice her opinion she can talk to me but stop making comments to my daughter. Once again she agreed and I left it alone. \n\nThen today I heard her again and I just lost my shit on her in front of my daughter and basically the whole house. I yelled at her to stop fucking making comments about my daughters body. I asked you politely and privately twice now and obviously you don't to listen. This is beyond concern and at this point you're body shaming her and I will not tolerate it. If you cannot control your mouth then you need to leave my home. She left the room with her crocodile tears and went to her room. \n\nShe later came to me and said I humiliated her when she was just concerned and the way I treat her is why my kids don't respect her. I told her no, my kids don't respect her because of all the horrible things she has done to me and she tried to protest but I just walked away. \n\nI do feel a little bad for yelling at her in front of everybody but damn I feel like she forced my hand.

Her failure to respect your daughters feelings resulted in her feelings being disrespected. Further, it may have done your daughter some good to see her Mom sticking up for her.", "NTA. You tried to do it politely and she didn\u2019t listen or respect you and your child. You went mama bear and with good reason. I would suggest telling her the next time she does it, you\u2019re giving her 30 days notice to vacate.", "Nta you spoke to your mom about it and she is living with you she should have respected your wishes and even if she didn't it's the nice thing to do you should kick her out she doesn't deserve you", "NTA.

I feel like any mother should be able to understand the body image expectations of kids these days and put 2 and 2 together.", "NTA you politely asked her multiple times to stop making comments. If she were that concerned, she could\u2019ve approached you, privately, not continued to make hurtful comments in front of your daughter. Also, I gather from your post she lives with you and you\u2019re likely helping care for her physically and/or financially, and you are a grown woman, in your home, looking out for your daughter, you\u2019re not a child yelling at her mom over something trivial. I hope your daughter finds out what is causing her rapid weight loss and is able to rectify that.", "NTA but is there a reason why you've not discussed with your 19 year old daughter ways for her to shut grandma down on her own?   \nThere's a good chance grandma has said things before that you've not overheard, your kids should know how to handle this and that you'd back them doing so.   \nShe is technically an adult and while she feels uncomfortable about her body she's old enough to have been given the tools needed to tell grandma to basically stfu and stop using \"concern\" as an excuse to discuss her body.", "NTA. Why would your mother turn the anxiety up a notch for your probably already scared daughter? You addressed it appropriately and politely twice. Losing weight for unknown reasons can be really frightening. You defended your daughter like any mother would, and should. Grandma is a jerk.", "NTA, kick her out. She can go spread her \u201cwisdom\u201d elsewhere.", "NTA, but dear god, teach your child(ren) to stand up for themselves! Your 19 year old shouldn\u2019t be afraid to voice her opinions to her grandmother.

Im 21 and live with my mom still and have been dealing with similar weight issues. My grandmother makes comments every time I see her and no matter how many times I ask nicely, she doesn\u2019t listen. I wish my mom would do as you did. You were patient and polite and asked her nicely to stop twice privately to not embarrass her(as if it mattered..) but she refused to listen and think grandma knows best (as if making remarks of that matter is helping). Don\u2019t feel bad, talk to your daughter and see how she\u2019s feeling about it all and hold your ground. Best of luck.

I told her no, my kids don't respect her because of all the horrible things she has done to me and she tried to protest but I just walked away.\n\nThis, and the fact that you already gave your mother two warnings is why you're NTA. Clearly handling things privately means she's treating it as a slap across the wrist at most, and it's worth noting that these conversations you've been hearing are **only the one's you've heard.** I place high odds your mother has been doing this deliberately out of ear shot for some time.\n\nYour mother is owed about as much respect as she has earned, and if she has done things in the past and present to earn a negative level of respect that is on her.", "NTA.  \"This is beyond concern and at this point you're body shaming her and I will not tolerate it.
