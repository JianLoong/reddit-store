I wish I told her years ago to stop saying these things to me as it really affected how I feel about my appearance. You are NTA for setting this boundary.

You've gained weight, I don't like the way you're doing your hair, you've lost too much weight, etc. She made the mistake of doing it in front of my husband once, after I had already asked her calmly not to say those things to me, and he popped off at her about it. She hasn't made a comment since. Sometimes, being nice just doesn't work with people like them. Don't let the crocodile tears fool you into feeling guilty. It's just a manipulation tactic.", "Kick that trash out. Pure and simple. Nta.", "ESH. You let your mother make way too many comments before you stuck up for your daughter.

She has become better the last few years because she went through treatment for lymphoma.  Strangely, cancer probably saved her.  Anyway, when she does get on a bender,  she becomes very dramatic and judgmental and makes off color comments like that usually at the most stressful times and usually about something she knows nothing about.

I don't want to jump the gun, but what if your mother is causing your family so much stress that it's affected your daughter now, which might be why she's lost so much weight?  Stress can cause weight loss, even animals can suffer from it because of high levels of stress, and the situation with your mother already sounds toxic as hell, I can't imagine what you're all going through.\n\nBut I'm glad that you're not taking her crap, your mother sounds like a low-level narcissist.

If she can't find other housing arrangements, you can just drop her off at a homeless shelter or a public park and leave her there.

It will help her more to see how you stand up for her than to get a vague \"i took care of it, it's fine now\" later. Especially since that is repeatedly turning out to not be the case.\n\nSecondly, the rule in your house is to only involve (in the confrontation) the people who are already involved (in the conflict). Every time your mom says something inappropriate to your daughter, that **makes your daughter an involved person**. Even if you want her to sit back and let you do most of the talking, by your own rule she should be there and get to participate.\n\nI fully support not only politely but firmly asking your mom to shut up the first two times, but also going off on her when she repeatedly broke her word. Additionally, I think you need to consider that the rule is not always the best way. Good rules are generally \"good for most situations\", but you have to recognize edge cases and know when falling back on the rule will cause more harm than good. Some people habitially cross lines, the way your mom does, precisely bc they think the wool is still pulled over most family members' eyes. Their basic human dignity is being protected even while they continue to to attack the dignity of someone else. It is better for everyone to know exactly what your mom's character is regarding weight and body issues, and for your mom to know that everyone knows. \n\nI say this as someone who has dealt with this exact thing: daughter with medically induced temporary weight issues & an older female relative who won't shut up after promising to do so or even bothering to learn what would be a healthy thing to say. The older relative was using her facade intentionally.
