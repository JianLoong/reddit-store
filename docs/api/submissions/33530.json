A friend of his new wife decided to throw her a bridal shower about a month after their wedding and invited my wife, sister, and sister in law. All three informed the new wife that they could not attend for various reasons (sister had to work, my wife had multiple birthday parties including her nephew, and my sister in law didn\u2019t feel comfortable going without either my sister or wife) and wished her well and promised to celebrate another time. The three of them had decided that since they could not make it they would do something special for the both of them as soon as they could and after the holidays. \n\nThe day of the bridal shower, as we\u2019re driving between birthday parties, my dad texts the three girls to tell them how angry and disappointed he was in them for not going to his new wife\u2019s bridal shower and how they should be ashamed of themselves. I was livid that he would speak to my wife that way and my wife was mortified. Per her request, I waited until I had calmed down to speak to my dad about it. \n\nI called him that night and he answered acting as if nothing had happened. I told him that I did not like him speaking to my wife like he did and he replied that he did nothing wrong. He said he can speak however he wants and she\u2019ll either get over it or she won\u2019t. My sister had also contacted him and expressed how she did not like being spoken to that way either. \n\nThe next day, I get a call from him telling me that he doesn\u2019t know why everyone is attacking him and that he couldn\u2019t care less if we\u2019re in his life anymore. I told him we want him in our lives, we just want him to stop speaking to people that way. He said he did nothing wrong and that he\u2019ll never change how he speaks to people. \n\nI feel like my request to not speak to my wife in a disrespectful manner is reasonable but AITA for telling him that?", "created_utc": 1703208925, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18o37iz/aita_for_telling_my_dad_not_to_disrespect_my_wife/", "score": 291, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The purpose of bridal showers is to help a young couple outfit their homes--a woman marrying a man with adult children does not need to do this.

Your dad has refused to apologize and has doubled down. Now it's time for step two. My suggestion for step two is that you tell your dad that since he has admitted that he's not going to change, all communication should go through you and not through your wife. Your wife shouldn't be exposed to his abuse. He should be blocked on her phone.\n\nAnd, if he should treat your wife like this in person, then, if it's your place, he is immediately told to leave.
