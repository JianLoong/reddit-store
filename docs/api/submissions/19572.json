My father had diabetes and his health was deteriorating fast. He was in the hospital and then got out. After he got out he was weak and was trying to rest at home.   \n\n\nI come from a big family with a lot of siblings. One of my sisters travels all through Europe and is frequently moving. Im in the US and I haven\u2019t been back to Europe in over a decade but talk a lot on the phone with them. We will call my sister  Anna. Anna decided to move in my parents house all of a sudden with her husband and 8 children for an unknown period of time and for reasons no one knows. She had no where else to go apparently. My mom is the closest with her and always sympathetic towards her so she is fine with her being there.   \n\n\n  \nMy dad was exhausted at this point coming home from the hospital just a day or two ago. My husband was talking to him on the phone and heard all these kids screaming and making noises. He asks is everything okay? My father just said he\u2019s tired, overwhelmed and can\u2019t really take it anymore and just wants to rest. My dad talks to my brother who lives there and says how is the environment in the house. My brother said it\u2019s a disaster and pretty noisy since the kids are running everywhere. My mom however said that it\u2019s not a big deal and not that noisy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are all Christian and me and my husband (and some siblings) just had a feeling my dad was going to die any day now and these were his last moments alive. Me and my husband felt bad for my dad and thought he deserved peace in his last moments. My husband asked to speak to my mother and she said \u201cNo, not now.\u201d So my husband asked to speak to Anna\u2019s husband. He said \u201cIf you don\u2019t leave this house by 7:00pm then i\u2019ll pay for a rental home where he can rest his final days. It\u2019s not okay for this man to work all his life and he can\u2019t even die in peace in his own home. I\u2019ll be calling back to make sure you have left.\u201d They tried to talk back and downplay everything but my husband really put his foot down and ultimately they left. After about two days, my father had to go back into the hospital and died. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo this day, my mother is still upset with me and my husband that he kicked Anna and her family out. She still comments to my husband and acts that we were really out of line and rude. I do want to add Anna was and is still building a new home near my parents house so they do have some money.

Your Mom probably needed their presence to distract her-that\u2019s my guess. Regardless, all you can do now is to say \u201cYes, mom, we know. You\u2019ve told us multiple times.\u201d And change the subject.", "NTA -I know I will be down voted a lot for this. But it appears to me that most of the Y T A comments have been written by folks who have never lived with a dying parent. That will change your perspective immediately. \n\nI lived with my mother the last 9 years of her life including the 18 months after her stroke and prior to her death. It\u2019s excruciating, for the person and those around them. \n\nThe sick/dying person realizes that they have lost control of their life, their body and possibly their mind. They are tired all the time-they want peace. Most of their care depends on others which is degrading to them. Especially if they have always been the backbone of the family. \n\nImagine not being able to cook your own meals, after a lifetime of cooking. Not being able to drive a car or sign your name or write or wash your body or being able to convey your thoughts clearly. Your once strong body is a shell of itself-you have trouble walking or picking things up. You don\u2019t remember how to turn on the stove or start the dishwasher or turn the TV on. \n\nNow imagine how exhausting that must feel day in & day out. Then add six noisy young children and an unsupportive wife to that scenario when you are just trying to survive. \n\nYou and your husband are NTA. At least you tried to give your father some peace\n In his final days. Sorry for your loss.", "INFO: it\u2019s not at all clear from this whether your father wanted them to leave or wanted to go to a rental if they wouldn\u2019t. Did you ask him?", "Just want to add since there\u2019s a little confusion that this was our last resort since it\u2019s pretty big, but my mom didn\u2019t want to speak at all to us and always sides with Anna, she was babysitting the kids and ignoring my father so he was pretty much by himself after coming out of the ICU but my dad was so weak and was mentally done. When my husband inquired Anna\u2019s husband he said \u201dDont worry it will all work itself out.\u201d", "NTA\n\nYour dad needed peace and quiet and wasn't getting it in his own home. I'm so sorry for your loss. I would guess it was a nice distraction for your mom to have so much chaos around, but when my dad was dying, we focused on what he needed and wanted, not anyone else. I think your dad deserved the same. I hope you can find peace in fond memories with your dad \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA - this was absolutely the correct coarse of action. Im sorry for your loss, I hope he was able to have peace from those final days.\n\nTo think your husband wrong in advocating for your father is absolutely ridiculous.", "I don't quite understand why your husband resorted to \"you must leave the house by 7pm or else\".\n\nIf the kids were being really loud and noisy surely there must have been another way to resolve this than kicking them out.", "YTA. It\u2019s your parents house, Mom and Dad. You decided your Mom doesn\u2019t get a day in her own house.\n\nYour mom knew the story, but you decided to sideline her.\n\nThe right response would have been talking to mom and dad, instead of treating your mom as an inferior who has to listen to your Husband.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry for your loss but your mother is right, you were out of line and rude. You yourself said you had no idea why she had to move in, didn't know what emergency she had. It was not your place.", "First of all I\u2019m sorry for your lost. Second, why did your husband feel the need to speak up on anything? That\u2019s your father and if you felt the way you felt YOU should have said something and even so, it wasn\u2019t your business. Personal me, if that was my father, I would have TALKED NICELY to everyone about be noisy and destructive and if that doesn\u2019t work, ask the father what HE wants to to do cause at the end of the day, it is his life. Rn, I believe YTA.", "YTA. And your husband is TA. \n\nWhat did your husband think? That he was going to kidnap your father out of his home and place him in a rental? Your mom makes the decisions for the home and for her husband in that situation. Not you and certainly not your husband. Your mom is 100% right, you and your husband were rude and overstepped. It is unfortunate that your mom was in a position of grief and wasn't able to stand up for her other child and her family because your husband came across as not only rude, but threatening when he said he would call back to make sure they were gone. \n\nYour husband put his foot down?

It wasn\u2019t your decision to make and it damn sure wasn\u2019t your husband\u2019s. If your father was that miserable, he could have said so or asked them to leave. This was a choice for your parents to make, not you.", "Very well said! Been there, done that. It\u2019s hard to be the caregiver, the goal is to do the best for your loved one. Certainly doesn\u2019t sound like Anna or her mom cared at all.", "It was if they didn\u2019t leave that my husband would find a rental for my dad so he can rest and pass. So that was the ultimatum.", "My husband reached out to her first, but She didn\u2019t want to talk since she is always doing things for my sister above everyone.", "We tried talking nicely, which I didn\u2019t add, but they didn\u2019t give my husband the time of the day. My dad was more close with my husband so that\u2019s why he felt to do it. My mom definitely wouldn\u2019t want to change her opinion for my dad regardless how he felt.", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he said exactly that, but was ignored. His wife, daughter, and son in-law failed miserably when it came to the needs of a dying man. There\u2019s zero reason they couldn\u2019t have worked together to tone down the kids\u2019 behaviour so OP\u2019s dad could have peace in his last days. It\u2019s their fault someone else had to step in and take control of the situation, because they refused to do so.", "Huh? I asked if you asked your dad what he wanted. You didn\u2019t answer that at all.", "Every comment you make comes across as \"I am jealous of my sister and don't want her around my mom and didn't want her around my dad.\" Your mom didn't want to have a discussion with you about her home and her husband at that point, which is reasonable. She doesn't have to discuss anything with you or with your husband. She said she had it handled and that should have been the end of it. \n\nYour husband overstepped. It was none of his business and he threatened people to get them to comply with his wishes when it isn't even his home. And again, did he think he was going to show up and kidnap your dad if no one complied? Or did he plan to physically harm your sister and her husband if they didn't comply? Because honestly his last words come across as a threat of potential physical violence.", "So your husband decided to be the boss of your mothers house?\n\nSince she didn\u2019t want to do something, he decided she was wrong and felt that he should control how she lives? \n\nWe are talking about her husband, your father. Apparently, as a kid in a foreign country, you know what\u2019s best for them, better then they do? \n\nObviously, there\u2019s a lot of jealousy of your sister, you\u2019ve pointed that out numerous times. How much was promoted by your jealousy of your sister being close to your mom while you live in a foreign country?", "It is unfortunate that no one in your family has learned the art of simply hanging up on you and your husband. You are an entire continent away. There was absolutely nothing your husband could have done. Not taking your calls when your husband just wanted to stir up drama would have been the best thing for them to do.", "Oh ok but did you ask him how he felt? I get why y\u2019all did y\u2019all did, but still this is you\u2019re fathers life  and if your husband are able to kick people out of someone else\u2019s house, he should be able to obey however your father would have felt, no?", "Sorry misread, he told my husband  he was emotionally drained from the hospital and just wanted peace. So that\u2019s what showed he cant stand everyone\u2018s noise.", "Absolutely not!! Wow that\u2019s taking an extra step there. I just wanted to give my dad peace with his last days on earth. I just wanted Everyone to think that shouldn\u2019t he have peace when he\u2019s about to die? No one was concerned about him and no one was going to stop the kids. My dad and mom struggled to see eye to eye on a lot of things so they definitely could not figure it out together. Obviously we are not psychotic to kidnap him and hurt my sister, i love her! I just thought they were all being inconsiderate.", "No jealousy at all, I\u2019m fine with them but it was more of everyone ignoring my dad And over running his house. He said he wants a place to rest. He was honestly just sitting there and my mom had no urgency that he\u2019s about to die and wasnt caring for him.", "I just made another comment but what they needed to do was hang up on your husband and not take his calls anymore. \n\nThere is a huge difference between \"Hey, it would be nice if you could take the kids out for a walk and have them play a little quieter\" and \"Get out or else.\" Your husband chose the latter despite being a continent away. It is more unfortunate that anyone even listened to him. \n\nYour mom is upset because you interfered in her home. Your husband interfered in her home.", "My FIL died in January. We temporarily moved into MIL house to be her support. The week before he died, we held 24 hour vigil, the thought of dying alone was too much. \n\nLosing your husband is pretty devastating. Having support for the survivors is imperative. \n\nSo how did you support your mom through the loss of her husband? By telling the person that she leaned on to move out.", "YTA. Your husband had no right to throw people out of some else's home. Neither of you were there to know what day-to-day life was like. Your father should have first say over how he spends his final days. Your mother should have second say. Your sister being there may have been a comfort to your mom. \n\nI was going to put E S H, but you never got direct confirmation from your dad that your husband did what he wanted. You don't know why sister and her family were there. It may be that your mom wanted them there for the company.\n\nSo, after two days your dad had to go back in the hospital and your mother went home to a quiet house instead of a home full of family? And you never said that your dad specifically communicated that he wanted your sister and her family out of the house. If anything, your brother who lives there should have handled the situation, if there was anything to handle. The way you know you f'ed up is that the person whose house you took liberties over is still furious with you.\n\nBeing Christian is no excuse for overriding your parents' decision about who is welcome and wanted in their home.", "Your husband did the right thing. I have dealt with serious health issues, I can't imagine having a bunch of kids around. When you are suffering, all you want is to be left alone in peace.", "That\u2019s rough. Who was cooking for him and living with him? \n\nIf he was dying, someone was doing the heavy lifting. Disparaging a widow is low.", ">Disparaging a widow is low.\n\nWhy? There are plenty of spouses, of both sexes, who disregard their partners near the end of life. It sounds like OP's mom was one.", "Who took him to the hospital? Fed him and cared for him after he got home from ICU?\n\nOP hasn\u2019t seen the parents for 10+ years. OP has stated they did none of the caring. The sole interaction was phone calls due to distance. \n\nSo, as the above comment put it, who was doing the caregiving? OP stated that besides the father; there was a mother, Anna and family and possibly one brother to provide care for a diabetic man released from ICU.\n \nI 100% agree caregiving is a massive commitment. So, who do you think was doing it, OP said they weren\u2019t so who\u2019s left?", "NTA. You need to handle this already.\n\n\"Mom, we did it for dad, not for you, and he was grateful. We only found out about it because he called us, miserable because all the noise kept waking him up. Now it's past time you let tbis go, and stop acting as if what you wanted was more important in that moment than whst dad wanted. Unless that's what you're saying. Is that what you think?\"", "YTA. It was NOT your husband\u2019s place to dictate what happens in other people\u2019s homes. You crossed the line. And how do you know that the stress of your sister and the children moving out did not hurt your father in his dying moments? Why would he want his end of life filled with family strife? Your inappropriate actions may have caused him more hurt, you fools. Not only that, you hurt the living people who were the ones there with him in his dying hours. You caused more stress for your mom, siblings, and nieces/nephews than necessary. Wow, how selfish of you.", "NTA\n\nQuestion...if you and your husband could get your dad a rental...could you have told your sister and her husband that you would get them a motel/hotel room or something? So that your dad would be able to stay and die at home.\n\nI know he went back to the hospital and died, I'm so sorry.\n\nI don't understand your mother's thoughts on this. Unless she wanted your sister there and not the zoo crew.\n\nThis is sad.", "Ignored him when he said he was exhausted and overwhelmed? Responded to his complaints by saying the kids weren\u2019t that loud."]}
