He has a 5 year old daughter \"Lydia\". Until I met my husband, Lydia had never heard the word no. She was pretty much running the house. They did things the minute she wanted something, she got it. There were several times where we would have plans to go out, whether as a couple or the three of us, but Lydia would decide that she wanted to do something else and he'd bend to it. We're out shopping and she wants a toy, even when he said no previously, he'd buy it. Out to dinner and Lydia decides she doesn't want to be there anymore? James was paying the check. She'd interrupt conversations and refused to have the attention be on anyone but her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, I drew my line in the sand before the two moved in with me. I said we couldn't control how she acted at her mother's, but a (then) nearly 4 year old was not going to run my house. We began laying boundaries. Lydia can obviously have opinions and feelings, but her tantrums will not win out and she is not in charge. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's worked for the most part. Lydia is for the most part a different kid with us. But then she'll go to her mother's, \"Ashley\". She'll spend 4 days with Ashley, 4 with us. The first day upon returning from Ashley's and she's that same spoiled little girl who expects the world to bend to her. It doesn't take long for her to remember that James and I will not tolerate such behavior. Ashley has chastised us several times for being \"too mean\" and saying \"she's just a little girl\". James backs me up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn December, I had my first child. Throughout the entire pregnancy, if we were talking names, Lydia would give her input. Stuff like \"Firetruck\" or \"Screwdriver\". I thought it was cute and funny. Then when we told her we were naming the baby \"Michael\", she insisted that we needed to name him \"Firetruck\". Again, I thought it was funny and she was just joking around like a kid. As time went on, I realized she really thought that was his name as it's all she'd call him. I corrected her several times. She'd roll her eyes or laugh. When I had the baby, that's all she'd call him. In spite of our correction. She said that the name we picked is stupid and his name is Firetruck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI finally sat her down and told her to stop. I said she doesn't get to name the baby, her father and I did. She tried to laugh it off and I said no, it's not funny. She can name her toys but she will not name her little brother. She got really upset and I told her I didn't want to hear her calling him that anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe went to her mom's yesterday and Ashley called James, pissed over \"how I spoke to her daughter\". She said it was a harmless nickname and I'm being a bitch. I said it's yet another way of Lydia trying to be the boss of the house and I'm not going to tolerate it.

What she\u2019s trying to do is get you to give in so she can slowly get it to be like mommy\u2019s house again. In this case, it\u2019s not a harmless nickname, it\u2019s crossing a line. First, I would have a conversation with her about why it\u2019s important to use his correct name. \u201cLydia, I want you to use Michael\u2019s actual name, because he\u2019s learning it right now. We want him to recognize his name, the same way you know that when we say \u201cLydia\u201d, you know we mean you! We can use nicknames later, and once we know what he\u2019s like, maybe you can give him a special nickname then that matches his personality!\u201d I would also work in how names are important and she wants people to call her by her name, etc. \n\nIf she continues, I would then simply ignore and correct. So if she said something like \u201cFiretruck has a dirty diaper\u201d, I would ignore her. I would instead make a huge deal out of sniffing the air and then say \u201cOh, MICHAEL, I think your diaper is dirty!\u201d Make a sticker chart. Anytime she says Michael, she gets a sticker. Something to that degree. \n\nIn her case, because of past behaviors, and how her mother allows her to behave, you cannot let her cross any boundaries that you have set.

Her dad needs to be active in these moments and parent or you will become a very easy scapegoat for Lydia\u2019s mother.

Lydia is continuing to push the envelope, she's had a taste of being the boss of everyone and she's not going to let that go without a fight.", "I was 2 when my sister was born, and gave her a nickname that\u2019s stuck 40+ years later. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve nipped this in the bud now. NTA.", "There's a lot of varying opinions here, from it being cute, childish behaviour to her pushing a boundary. But the most important thing is context. In a child with a good understanding of boundaries and no behavioural issues, it would be cute behaviour. In a child with a history of having no boundaries and therefore lacking the ability or the will to maintain boundaries, it should be construed as an attempt to push another boundary. \n\nYou're going to have significant issues in the future with Lydia, as she grows older and her mother continues to indulge her every whim. You need to discuss the issues before they rise with your husband, as this will mean that Lydia will refuse to visit your household as she gets older. Probably to her detriment.\n\nNAH. Mainly due to the fact that NTA would make the kid the AH, and she is just ignorant and pushing another boundary like any indulged child would. The only AH is the indulgent mother, who doesn't realise the rod she's making for her own back.", "NTA-  She is a child and needs to have rules and boundaries.  Tell your MIL and Ashley that Lydia is a child and doesn't make any decision. That is what adults are for. As far as the nickname,  ask Lydia why that name.   She what she says.   As far as Lydia, does she have friends?

Basically, I'm saying that Firetruck might stick if this little girl believes it for long enough, even though she will undoubtedly grow out of it.\n\nI think it is completely valid to explain to her that what she is doing is wrong, and I don't think you did it in a malicious or harmful way.", "It\u2019s not cute your stepdaughter is doing this.  It\u2019s not a cute nickname. It\u2019s not your child\u2019s name and and it\u2019s not okay by any means.   Your husband needs to say it is not okay.  And his mother needs to butt out.  I\u2019m guessing she still likes the ex-wife.", "NTA -\n\nShe's been indulged so long that she doesn't recognize boundaries. Kudos to you for enforcing them and doing it at an age appropriate level.", "NTA.  Your sons name is 'Michael', unless he wants to identify as a firetruck later it life its proper to teach the world his name as he learns it himself.   \nside> His sisters mother prob is and encourages the behavior and you are in for years of petty family squabbles.

But at the same time she still is 5 which is a hard age to deal with some times. I\u2019ve dealt with it twice both times they just love to act like they the boss, but they also knew they were not the boss.\nAs I said sit with her and come up with a nickname for her baby brother together so she has a special bond with him only she will have", "Gentle YTA. Not for enforcing boundaries generally, but for picking this battle. First, she probably wants a reaction so you are feeding into it. Second (and more importantly), I suspect there are a few emotions below the surface; maybe she\u2019s concerned that the new baby is taking attention away from her and calling him \u201cFiretruck\u201d is a way to get that frustration out.", "While I sympathize, this is a silly hill to die on.  Let her call him firetruck.  If she says it to you, pretend you didn\u2019t hear her, refuse to acknowledge it, if you must.  But don\u2019t fight.  If your son decides he hates it, THEN fight her.  If he likes it, no problem.  \n\nAll the other fights with her are worth it.  Just remember that punishment doesn\u2019t work well, natural consequences work far better.  Set her up to succeed. Have her earn privileges.  It can even be most interesting things to do or have are privileges to be earned.  Time outs are for overwrought kids to calm down, and come back when they are ready to talk calmly. Used as punishments, they often backfire.", "Nta for enforcing boundaries, but yta for choosing this hill to die on. Little kids nickname their siblings.  It\u2019s something they do.

It\u2019s great that husband is on board with teaching respect and boundaries while she\u2019s at your house as well. She can keep that bossy britches act at her mothers and if her mom doesn\u2019t like the rules you guys enforced she can keep her whole daughter with her too.

She *knows* her brother's name isn't firetruck, she's fucking with you.\n\nYou got sucked into a spat with a 4 year old and took it to a point where it crossed from a game to \"adult is really mad at me\" which is why she broke down. You most definitely overreacted.\n\nFwiw it's a super cute nickname, the kind you can joke about when they're older.", "YTA but not on purpose.\n\nFirst off, you should not think of your 4 year old (step) daughter as \u201ca spoiled brat\u201d.

But guess what, you\u2019ve now been around for 40% of this kid\u2019s life.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be an evil stepmother, I would spend more time thinking about how you will show her that you respect her as a whole person. This is so that she in turn will learn to behave better through empathy rather than due to your authority.\n\nRight now you are showing up as a still newer figure in her life, and regularly setting new boundaries, rules, and expectations. \n\nKids do learn to follow rules, but underlying that has to be respect and empathy for others as the real motivation for them. This is something they reciprocate. \n\nSome ideas:\n\nIf you called the baby fire truck, and laughed with a real smile on your face\u2026 if you went to the store store and got a toy fire truck for her to give the baby as a gift\u2026. You might find that goes a much longer way to get her to stop teasing you. \n\nAlso think about it from Lydia\u2019s perspective. It used to be Lydia and James. Then you entered her life. Now there\u2019s a new baby. While those are all potentially happy additions to the family, you can see why that is also scary for a young girl starting elementary school. The life she knew is over, she has a lot more responsibilities to take on, and she\u2019s not the baby in the family anymore.", "YTA. This would be entirely different if this was an adult refusing to call Michael by his name. Or a teen. Or even an older child. \n\nWe\u2019re talking about a literal 5 year old.

They\u2019re children. \n\nI may have shocking news here. Michael will care exactly 0 that she calls him firetruck. If Michael were older and had expressed that he hates this nickname and that it upsets him, sure. Sit down the five year old and explain that she needs to understand and respect her brother\u2019s preferences and feelings. \n\nBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.

I know you think you\u2019re the shit and all, but did you ever stop to think your approach is the issue? Getting onto her too much is giving her a reaction which is why she\u2019s doing it.

She is now an adult and while refusing to acknowledge my relationship with my wife expects us to be present aunts to her kids. She\u2019s pregnant with her first and can\u2019t even stand the attention she has to give her dogs so I am honestly so worried for this kid.", "Look, you\u2019re NTA and obviously she\u2019s messing with you. You\u2019ve done right imposing structure and boundaries but this may not be the hill to die on. And kids have had weirder nickname from siblings. Just ignore her when she references Firetruck and pretend like you don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s talking about until she uses his name. She\u2019ll get bored by the lack of reaction and move on\u2026 probably. Or she may call him Firetruck forever and it will be funny story about when they were little one day.", "NTA", "Call her fire truck back. Who cares. Oh you do", "Agree. I don\u2019t understand the y t a votes, or really, why she posted. She set a boundary with her step-daughter. That seems totally normal.", "Stepmoms are different than teachers. Don\u2019t take that the wrong way\u2026I LOVE teachers and I think we should show the same level of passion for supporting teachers as some people do blue lives. That being said, before stepparents should set boundaries, the children should feel unconditional love and acceptance from them bc that is what their home should provide.", "I thought the exact same thing about the mom and also the custody arrangement.", "I don't disagree. They originally did alternating weeks but that was \"too long\" for Ashley.", "This is the best take so far. The best that OP and her husband can do is create a loving and stable home environment and hope that Lydia chooses that over the chaos of her mother\u2019s as she grows older (it is possible).", "She has friends, but she does often get in trouble at school for bossing the other kids around. I swear at least once a week when I'm picking her up, she's playing by herself as a consequence to trying to tell the other kids what to do, how to play, etc.", "MIL and Ashley are very close. It's been a long-running dilemma.", "I feel like it\u2019s an age appropriate things to do \u2014 My 5yo nephew nicknamed by daughter Pizza when she was born. \n\nNTA for boundaries, YTA for overblowing the nickname issue. Also getting the sense that OP has zero affection for this child, which makes me sad that she has to live with OP part time. \n\nMy prediction is the kid is going to be seeing less and less of her dad as she gets older.", "At her mother's, she gets her way each and every time. Her mom makes her multiple meals if she refuses to eat what's served. Staying up late because she doesn't want to go to bed. If she doesn't want to go to pre-school, she goes to work with mom (don't know how that'll work in kindergarten next year). Her mom had a date and because Lydia didn't want her going out, her mom backed down and stayed home. It's ridiculous.", "Keep in mind you're taking OP's word for how this child supposedly \"is\". She's the one putting it in a narrative of a power struggle, something that's more likely to be a product of her mind through projection. A little girl around 4 is *not* trying to set up a dumb mean girl power struggle about who is the most important female in the house/her dad's life, OP who came in for sloppy seconds is.\n\nLydia seems like a normal child to me and sure, firetruck is unusual as far as nicknames go, but she's preschool age! It's not offensive, and it likely makes sense to her in a similar vein as how Thomas the Train Engine is a thing and such. If it were an allusion to a curse word, or anything remotely rude, I'd understand, but this is perfectly innocuous and it doesn't seem like there's any bad intentions here, other than OP hating her life cause she has so pretend to tolerate her husband's daughter from a previous relationship. \n\nI feel bad for this girl.", "i called my brother b-i-n-g-o (in that song tone) before he was born and my sister was rainbow sparkle", "I wouldn\u2019t think that about my child that I am raising because my child is being taught appropriate boundaries and that what mommy and daddy say goes, not that she can have whatever she wants whenever she wants it and do whatever she wants whenever she wants to.\nMy 9 year old brother is a spoiled brat (myself and my mother both admit that) and has been raised pretty much the way same way OP\u2019s stepdaughter raising has been described. \nMy mother now deeply regrets it because it is far too old to act the way he does about not getting his way, etc., but she knows he acts like that because she over indulged him out of guilt for working a lot.", "I love and care for my step-daughter. Just because I pointed out her relevant poor behavior-that I blame on her parents-doesn't mean otherwise.", "It is not just her getting toys. That I could overlook. It was us having plans to go out, again not just us as a couple but we'd plan a fun day out to the beach or the zoo, but she'd want to do something else and we'd have to do that. Or we'd be somewhere and she'd decide she was done, so that was it. We were once out to dinner. She had plenty of things to keep her busy but she wanted to go home. My husband agreed. If we were having a conversation, she'd interrupt and refuse to let me talk to him.\n\nI care for and love my step-daughter very much. But the fact is, she has been spoiled by her parents. That is not her fault whatsoever but it needs to stop. She needs consistent boundaries.\n\nYou picked one example out of my many to make me look like a wicked step-mother.", "WTF? This is an absolutely terrible take on this. She hates the child because she wants to set boundaries? I work with kids and I can guarantee you that good parents who love their kids will set boundaries, not because they hate the kids, but because that is best for the kids. \n\nThis might be normal behaviour for a child, but a good parent would do exactly what OP did and tell the child that it\u2019s not appropriate. SD may be feeling some jealousy and resentment towards the child, but letting her do whatever she wants, including calling the baby an inappropriate name, is not the way to handle this.", "If Ashley didn't want Lydia to be called something, I would 100% enforce it in my own home. \n\nThere is also a huge difference between a nickname like \"sissy\" or \"little brother\" and her deciding the baby should be named \"firetruck\" and refusing to ever call him by his real name. But again, if Lydia said she didn't want to be called something or her mother didn't want her to be, we'd respect it. As it is, Lydia (not her real name, obviously) doesn't like going by what would be considered a \"go-to\" shortened version of her name. I have always respected that and will tell my son to do the same. Because I care about my children learning about boundaries and respecting others.", "She is not a toddler. She is 5 years old. I would understand it more if she was 3.", "I love and care about her, but I don't find her disrespect or misbehavior cute. It's also not her fault-at all. James admits they indulged her too much because they split before she was even 1. They wanted to make things easier. But it has to end now. She isn't in charge. Obviously I can't control Ashley's house, but in our own, she will be respectful and know that we are the adults, she is the child. Something she is slowly learning. She stopped calling him firetruck after that talk.", "How is asking Lydia to call OP\u2019s son by his name being an evil step mom? As far as we know OP was civil and didn\u2019t yell or punish Lydia. A four year old can understand that there are rules that need to be followed including using the name Michael not firetruck.", "She's 5 years old.", "With all due respect, screw what Ashley wants. Her kid is the one dealing with the brunt of the emotional turmoil.", "I do love and care about my step-daughter. I just don't find her misbehavior adorable like her parents tend to. It's not her being \"a little bossy baby\". She's getting older and it's time to realize she isn't in charge.", "Totally age appropriate.", "Oh jeez, why do I feel like you\u2019re going to be in the entitled people sub in a few years", "Yet\u2026. You got upset over something as silly as this? \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even call this an example of bad behavior\u2026. Rather her just joking the way toddlers do and you being way too intense about it. To me it just seems like a weird thing to bring issue with.", "I know it's crazy, but not every stepmother is a wicked witch. Sometimes the child needs to have boundaries enforced. Sometimes the ex purposely winds up the child. I'm sorry you're going to get slammed. But you are entitled to your feelings.\n\nIn the meantime start calling her Ambulance. At least try to make it cute and fun. Like Ambulance and Firetruck. She may love it and you bond over it and you can find some humor in Firetruck. You can also ask her why she choose Firetruck. That may give you some insight. Either way, good luck!  \n\nAnd you are not Bitch Eating Crackers.", "Look, I get it. It's a blended family and the ex isn't helping her daughter adjust, but is rather stoking the tension. But \"she will be respectful?\" You can't *make* anyone be respectful, especially a 5-year-old traumatized by her parent's divorce. You *gain* respect. Good luck.", "Edit: 5 years old. Makes no difference. You\u2019re still being unreasonable.", "Again, you're preaching to the choir. Until me, my husband bent over backwards to keep Ashley happy in order to keep the peace and MIL encouraged it. I've squashed that and Ashley resents she can't walk all over him anymore.\n\nThe custody situation is still the same because it's not as easy to change. It's in writing with the court.", "Kids give nicknames. I\u2019ve called one of my brothers \u2018pony\u2019 and my cousin \u2018snuff\u2019 because\u2026idk honestly but they stuck and that\u2019s how I talk to them.", "Except she's not being \"in charge\".  She's being 100% age appropriate right now.  Little kids, and she is still a very, very little kid, give people nicknames.  She only gets her dad part time and has been replaced by a new baby.  Adults don't handle that well.  She's coping by making a part of the baby hers.  By nicknaming him she's controlling the only part of this situation that she can.  You're so used to pushing back against her bad behavior that you see all of her behavior as bad.", "She's not a toddler. She is 5 years old. Let's not infantilize her. She's an intelligent little girl who knows what she's doing.", "Trust me that she will show her son far more grace\u2026that\u2019s natural\u2026but you have to work on that or you should never have married into her family.", "Like mother, like daughter", "Yes\u2026 knows what she\u2019s doing. Playing around. And I simply misremembered her age\u2026 but I\u2019m sorry 5 is still pretty much a toddler. Kids up to 4 are basically considered toddlers. I have like 10 kids in my immediate family between the ages of 3 and 13. I\u2019m not dumb.", "No, 4 is not a toddler. Toddlers range between ages 2-3 years old. She is practically a kindergartner. Again, let's not infantilize her.", "Lol I love how you say that as if a kindergarten is so above a \u201ctoddler\u201d. I\u2019m sorry to tell you, but while development does happen at these ages, the level of maturity doesn\u2019t really change much. She was joking around and you decided to be uptight about it. YTA.\n\nAlso- 4 is pretty much a transition phase into \u201cbig kid\u201d, but is still basically a toddler behavior wise.", "I think I know a bit more about child development than you, as a teacher. But thank you.", "Lol you can assume what you want about that, but being bitter and condescending because you don\u2019t like my vote really doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019ll sleep fine \ud83d\ude18. It\u2019s funny to me that you thought pulling that card out was some sort of flex."]}
