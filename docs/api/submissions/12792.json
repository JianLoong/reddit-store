My oldest told her that that's a doll not his cousin. She started yelling that he should apologize to her and to Lilibet. That none of us support her. That we make fun of her and Lilibet without understanding that their bond is so strong they can't live without each other.\n\nWhile she was going yelling, I grabbed the doll and threw it out into our drive way. She swatted at me and ran to \"save\" Lilibet. I told my brother to leave and to not come back with that doll.\n\nI had to block SiL bc of her all-night string of vile texts.

Wtf? Lol NTA. You know how pissed I'd be dealing with that? A doll is NOT a member of the family. Encouraging mental illness isn't a solution. She needs help and your brother needs to make sure she gets that help. The kids don't understand that, and it makes everyone in the family feel awkward I'm sure.", "NTA\n\nThis behavior would be unnerving to anybody. Just because SiL needs help doesn't mean that OPs family needs to be exposed to this behavior. The fact that SiL is harassing real children about her doll is beyond over the line.", "INFO: what the fuck", "Wtf did I just read... your SIL needs some pretty serious help if she's convinced herself that a doll is a real person.\n\nEdit: Just read up about \"reborns\" - they seem to be particularly used in helping women overcome the trauma of miscarriages and still births, as a way of transferring the building maternal emotions onto something lifelike. Therapists who advocate for their use seem quite clear that their patients need to recognise that the doll is not real, it doesn't need to be fed, and not to treat it as a living family member or introduce it to wider circles of family/friends etc. They're supposed to be a deeply personal thing for the woman to hold and dress. Mostly I've read that the compulsion to show affection to the doll disappears after a few  months.\n\nYour SIL, with her untreated BPD, seems to be using this reborn in a really unhealthy way and without the accompanying psychological treatment that is normally received. I think your reaction was probably unhelpful given the obvious problems she's displaying, but at the same time I think you need to make it pretty clear to your brother that this situation needs resolving professionally ASAP.", "I'm gonna be alone in this but NTA.\n\nI wouldn't care how much it took but I would not want this woman in my life or around my real nieces or nephews. The SECOND she would yell at the nephew I would stop taking her mental health into consideration. She refuses treatment and therapy, she's never going to get better. To the people saying NTA how long would you tolerate this behavior? Until she gets physical with the neices and nephews? Imagine how far traumatic itd be to get spanked over a doll. Honestly it's a good thing that you threw the doll on the driveway! Let her cut you and your family out of her, your safety and the childrens are way more important than her sanity, or lack thereof.", "I was raised by a borderline. I totally get it. I  understand why you threw the doll. Most people with bpd folks in their lives have done something similar. And i understand why you don't want to apologize. She will never, ever, ever, ever, ever let you forget it if you do.\n\nSo don't. \n\nThere now are treatments for bpd, including dialectical behavior therapy. It isn't perfect, but it has a decent success rate. If SIL won't seek it there is nothing you can do.\n\nSo you can get therapy yourself to cultivate the detachment you need to cope with her. This was my choice, to be able to empathize with and protect myself from (mostly) my mother's damage, because she needed my help. But I was never free until she died at age 93.\n\nOr you can do what most do and go no contact. Sad for your brother, but it will protect your family.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. The minute she started verbally abusing a child about their treatment of her doll all bets were off. \n\nI understand she's unwell, but that needs to be dealt with not foisted onto children who aren't going to understand why their aunt is mad at them for not playing with their \"cousin\".", "NTA. She was verbally abusing your REAL child over a DOLL, which isn't being used correctly to treat her mental illness.

I worked at a tourist attraction (which was loud and supposed to be loud) and this woman with a pram with two reborn dolls in it started shouting at the staff that we were too loud and were disturbing her babies.

But I also wouldn\u2019t want to be around that person while they were demanding everyone act like a doll was a real living breathing human. It\u2019s creepy, I question how far they would take it and I don\u2019t want to stick around to find out.", "No she needs help and just going along with it is not going to help her.", "NTA she is delusional and a danger to your actual real flesh and blood children.", "NTA. The second SIL started acting aggressive with your children and trying to force them to treat the reborn doll as a legitimate child you had every right to kick her out (although throwing the doll outside might have been a bit harsh. But you were protecting your children, so in the end that is besides the point). A reborn doll can be utilized as an effective coping mechanism for people experiencing infertility, miscarriage, infant loss, etc. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THERAPY/PROFESSIONAL HELP. Without seeking actual treatment, the reborn doll is doing more harm than good in the end. Your brother is an AH for efforcing this behavior.", "This reminds me of Lars and the real girl lol", "NTA for refusing to give in to her delusions or for forcing your kids to. I'm no doctor and I think there's nothing wrong with using a doll as part of therapy or for the person's own sake, but forcing others to do so crosses several lines into psychosis. She needs help.\n\nThrowing the doll out into the driveway was extreme, because if she is convinced this is a real child then of course she would freak out. Slightly asshole-ish way to act, but your reasoning is not wrong. I'd apologize for throwing the doll but refuse to treat it as a real baby, and insist she sees a professional about this. I wouldn't have her around my kids until she got help.", "NTA. this story made my day. still laughing loudly.\n\nSIL is a nut!!! don't ever apologize to these people. you'll get eaten alive!!", "NTA. When she starts insisting that your children buy into her craziness, she crosses the line.  You were perhaps a little emphatic in your shutting down her nonsense...but it needed to be shut down.

You can be both mentally ill and an asshole. Even if she thinks the doll is real, there\u2019s no excuse for yelling at a child for not wanting to play with your child, and you certainly shouldn\u2019t be unloading your familial frustrations onto your nephew. I\u2019d stay NC unless she starts actively working with a therapist.\u201d Your kids don\u2019t need to bear the brunt of her issues.", "NTA. First off, she screamed at your kid without any half decent reason. \n\nSecondly, she seems deeply, deeply, unstable. Her behaviour is frankly disturbing and screaming at a child over a doll could escalate to physical violence. Until she gets serious mental healthcare and demonstrates serious improvement, I would not let her near your kids, and treat her as potentially dangerous.", "NTA.  When she starts insisting your kids join in her fantasy, it's time to create boundaries.  This is a potentially unsafe situation for members of your family.  She needs treatment, not an apology from you.", "For crying out loud, can't she get a dog and at least be a dog mom? I admit, she sounds pretty crazy and if she became a dog mom she would undoubtedly drive everyone out of their minds over that, but a doll? \n\nYou are completely right in cutting her out of your life.

She needs therapy or a suggestion of adopting a kid if she's so desperate for one. but before that, it's best if a doctor checks her out mentally, it doesn't seem like a safe situation to give a real baby to someone like her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: after seeing your recent comments about her abuse towards your brother, he might just be going along with it and encouraging it and defending it, just to avoid her wrath. it only makes me more sure that she shouldn't have a real baby, any time soon.", "This woman needs mental help ASAP. She is clearly unwell and becoming dangerous. Her reaction to you and your son in this latest encounter shows she is escalating in her instability. Your brother and the rest of your family could very well be in serious danger from this woman.", "NTA. I know reborn dolls help some people cope with the loss of pregnancy, or a coping mechanism for a little while finding out they can't have children, but I've never heard of it going this far. Unfortunately it sound like your SIL needs some serious help and your brother seems to be enabling her for a while I could see it but insisting that everyone act like the doll is alive isn't ok neither is her yelling at your son. I'm not saying I don't emphasize with her but she does need help of some sort even if she doesn't belive in therapy, there's alternative ways for her to get the help she needs.", "NTA... I'm going to be very blunt about this... Please do NOT expose your children to this unstable woman ever again. She needs professional help, and you need to distance yourself and your family from her as much as possible... Cut all contact, if possible. Your kids should *never* have to experience one of her episodes again. \n\nThere's no need to regret throwing the doll... it was 100% worth doing if it means she will stay away from you and your children.\n\nHer behaviour can easily escalate, and she could seriously harm you or your children someday if you continue down this slippery slope associating yourself with someone who has a very serious unchecked mental illness that causes aggressive outbursts.\n\nIf anybody says YTA, it should *only* be because you've let an extremely unstable mentally ill woman spend time around your children for as long as you have already.\n\nI'm a huge supporter of mental health and destigmatizing mental illness, but there comes a point where you need to stop acting like it isn't dangerous allowing an extremely mentally ill person who refuses treatment to be around children... There's a time and a place for everything, and when there are children involved, a child's safety and well-being takes precedent over ensuring your unchecked severely mentally ill relative doesn't feel left out. She *needs* to be left out, at least until she accepts professional help and makes *significant* progress, learns how to *properly* regulate her emotions, and to set a *good example* for children rather than traumatizing them.", "NTA- maybe if she was actively in therapy dealing with her mental health, then perhaps dealing with the doll for a bit.
