He is of course welcome to buy his own mother a gift.", "NTA - but you could gift her something like a little gift card for coffee or a houseplant", "NTA. It\u2019s not petty, you literally spent so much money on her to help her out and she didn\u2019t even say thank you, she just asked where her present was? Honestly that would have been enough for me. If your husband thinks his mommy deserves a present, he can put in the effort and get it himself. She shouldn\u2019t have even been looking at you like it was your responsibility anyway.", "NTA. He can get off his butt and buy his mommy a present. Actually he can help with buying presents for all of his family.", "MIL gave it away - she didn\u2019t even sell it!  Since she wasn\u2019t desperate for the money, she should have given the tv back to OP.  It\u2019s not like OP wouldn\u2019t notice the missing tv.  NTA", "A bit petty but sometimes that\u2019s the best solution.", "I was going to suggest a candle from the thrift store.", "This is my suggestion too. Go to the Dollar Store and get the cheapest crap you can find, chocolates or something and wrap it nicely. Assure your husband you've seen the error of your ways and got her a gift. \n\nNTA", "Did you read over the part where the MIL said but where is my present after receiving the TV. I think that is very disrespectful. You don't appreciate the gift because others could also use it, even though you got the most expensive gift", "In the early days of my marriage, my MIL was very difficult and never liked what anyone got her plus she was wealthy and got herself what ever she wanted so she was hard to buy for, nothing I ever got her was good enough and you could tell she didn\u2019t like it so I told my husband he was in charge of his own mothers gifts from now on!  It worked well, she didn\u2019t always like what he got her either but seemed to appreciate his effort as it made her feel special and took the heat off of me.", "She asked for it by crying to OP about it", "That makes it all the better - you can have your revenge on both of them by having him buy her a comically bad gift.", "There's a whole That 70s Show episode on this: you buy the most hideous presents possible, and you never have to shop again! It works with laundry too: destroy a few of her favorite clothes and you never have to do laundry again!\n\nAt any rate, your husband is a quick learner, and soon you will be doing everything! It's called weaponized incompetence. Also, your husband is a big momma's boy - you will be having a lot of trouble with him and his family in the future. It's only the beginning.", "Then he\u2019s perfect for this task!", "Christmas wouldn't have been ruined. They didn't even have to forgo gifts--they could have just *not had a TV* for a little while. I bet she actually wanted extra money and sold it.", "That part didn't make sense so I just ignored that. I have given board games as gifts, and no one ever said that it wasn't a gift because others will use it also. Or expensive candles where others will also enjoy them when being used. Buy her a nightgown or something. Not too expensive, and no one else will use it hopefully.", "I'm not defending MIL, her behavior is just bad.  But it is possible that she wanted a TV but didn't want a \"huge smart TV\".  I know lots of people who absolutely hate large TVs and do not want a smart TV, and those preferences are more common the older the person is.", "Because she was sad it got broken and wanted to talk to somebody.\n\nThat does not imply she  is asking them to buy big smart TV. When people cry and talk about something broken, it is not always with manipulative intent to maky you buy a them expensive item.", "NTA.\n\n\nBut do a donation in her name since she wants to give stuff away", "NTA. Let your husband buy her a gift", "op=NTA\n\nBut family drama will ensue.  \n\nLet your husband take responsibility for buying(and CAP the amount allowed since your assets are joint and his spending outrageously will be coming out of your pocket).", "NTA. Get her a candle, one that\u2019s on sale (don\u2019t remove the sale sticker). You got her a gift, she\u2019ll be the ungrateful one if she complains. Merry Christmas!", "NTA. Get her a universal remote for Christmas and put hubby\u2019s name on it.", "NTA\n\nHave your husband buy your MIL a gift, just make sure he has a budget limit. With any luck, he\u2019ll do a terrible job and MIL will come to appreciate your generosity as she should have in the first place.", "NTA get her the cheapest card if there must be a present for her", "NTA. Why does it so often default on women to take care of gifting practices?  He can get something for his own mother like a big boy.", "YTA.", "NTA he can buy the gift I mean she is his mother", "Your husband needs to buy gifts for his family , not you .", "1. No one \u201chas\u201d to buy a TV.\n\n2. No one responds so rudely as MIL upon opening a gift.\n\n3. Get her an actual gift. It can be incredibly small and inexpensive. But don\u2019t make things any more awkward than they are\u2014MIL is the rude one, don\u2019t you be rude, too.\n\nYWBTA\n\nETA: can you and husband give her a gift \u201cfrom both of you?\u201d", "NTA. She refused to parent her own kids and put it on you. She sounds quite entitled, and let me back up. Your husband doesn't buy gifts for his own family? Does he help with the shopping? Give input? It's not as terrible as it could be because you're paying (presumably) from your joint account so it's his money too, but it's also *your* money, and you said *you* are the one who worked to buy that TV.\n\nI would say that she's entitled to give away her gifts if she doesn't want them, as they're now her property, but she is in the same vein not entitled to your money and effort. Especially when she's so ungrateful about it.", "NTA, if he wants to get his mother, he's ungrateful and rude mother, a gift, he needs to put in the effort.\n\nHim trying to make you out to be a villain when his mother pressed for that particular gift with a huge guilt trip, and then spit in your face not only when you gave it to her, but later on.\n\nYou actually don't Have to get her anything, tell her that you actually got her a TV, so she needs to go get it from that other person's house if she wants a Christmas gift. The only thing you have to do is deal with your husband and tell him he's not allowed to make you out to be a villain when he doesn't do anything about his mother treating you with blatant disrespect and doesn't have your back even in private over it", "ESH but you\u2019re the least to blame. \n\nYour MIL seems entitled. I don\u2019t like that she asked you for the TV in the first place\u2026you were 21(?) at the time and she called you crying? I don\u2019t know many 21 year olds who can spend 300 on a single gift for someone else. \n\nBut imo, when you gift someone something, you have to accept that it may not be used for your intended purpose. I completely understand why you\u2019d be upset (I would), but it\u2019s still a gift that you chose to give. Perhaps be more mindful of gifting people within your means in the future, so in the future, this doesn\u2019t sting as much. This is not meant to be a jab or condescending at all. \n \nLastly, your husband needs to put more effort into gift giving. It is something he can learn. It\u2019s easy for spouses to ask their spouse to let things about in-laws go when they have no stake in the game. And I think that would make him more understanding of your POV in the future.", "NTA", "No one is obligated to ask the gift giver of they want the gift back. Not even if they hate it. \n\nIt's not normal and a really weird expectation.", "Indeed, that's his mother, if he wants her to get a gift, he has a hard $20 limit and he needs to put in the work. She's already shown you that you gain nothing from putting a large amount of money and emotional energy into her", ">I like this better than my idea, guaranteed to be within budget and malicious compliance all in one.", "I guess I\u2019m a little confused here by some of this reply\n1. Genuinely asking, did I imply I had to buy it? I know I didn\u2019t have to buy it, but I felt horrible she was so distraught over it and the expense it would be, so I saved up and I bought it for her. \n2. She didn\u2019t ask it as we were tearing into the presents, but she did ask on Christmas. right after breakfast, the kids went to play with their toys and the two of us sat to chat and have a coffee, and she asked me point blank where her present was.\n3. I appreciate your thoughts, thank you!", "Aka, your husband doesn't put in the emotional effort to figure out what people want. He could literally ask them what they want and get them that. It's not rocket science he needs to put in the work.\n\nI think you need to ask yourself the question whether or not this is just weaponized and competence, because it sounds like it is", "So she was extremely ungrateful two years ago, that doesn't change the fact that MIL is entitled to do whatever she wishes with her property. It would be incredibly graceless of op to decide that this means she shouldn't get a present at all. OP chose to give her an expensive present, if op doesn't want to spend the same amount of money that makes sense, but no present at all would be unnecessarily vindictive. If it were my MIL I'd give a smaller present with enough care that MIL wouldn't feel left out, but I wouldn't spend a hinge amount of money again.", "Please read into weaponized incompetence and how to battle it. Because your husband is trying to thrust all the labor on to you, and you need to figure out shrugging It off", "That was my thought as well. It's reasonable to feel upset and snubbed bc your MIL didn't react well to a present and then gave it away, but frankly it's not worth snubbing her back out of spite. I'd just complain to my husband and girlfriends about it lol.", "NTA. My husband is in charge of buying gifts for his family and I'm in charge of mine. You are married to an adult man, he can shop for his family.", "NTA. Your husband is perfectly capable of buying his mom a gift.", "ESH. Her for being demanding and expecting the TV and another present. You for controlling what she does with a gift. Your husband for expecting you to get the gift for his mother.\n\nJust have him get a gift and say it's from both of you. That's normal.", "NTA, IMO buying gift for adults is weird, my family does an optional \"secret Santa\" that you can choose to join or not but the idea that you just buy other adult's gifts is expensive as all fucks.", "NTA. She was ungrateful and gave away the present from last year. If your husband wants to give her a gift, he should pay for it spend time looking for it.", "NTA\n\nJust get her something cheap. Don't have to be expensive, or even thoughtful, just go buy a cheap sweater or something. \n\nWhen she says something, be like well if you decide to give away your gift again, at least I wouldn't have wasted hundreds of dollars on it for you. \n\nthat way she isn't left out, but the point is made.", "Make a donation in her name to a charity of your choice. There's also the charities where you can buy trees, supplies, sponsor an animal in their name.", "This. But if you decide to do this be sure you agree on a budget beforehand because men who don\u2019t normally shop will usually overspend if suddenly given gift buying responsibility. Speaking from experience here.", "He can get people gift cards if he is so terrible or ask people for gift idea lists. He can get gift receipts for the things he buys so they can return it if they don't like it. He buys you gifts so he can handle buying other gifts too.", "I am sorry if you feel people are being harsh here.  You never said that you felt obligated to buy the TV.  You never complained about being responsible for your in-laws\u2019 gifts.  You bought the TV for MIL\u2019s household with all the right intentions, but then she was ungrateful by getting rid of it.  \n\nRemember, MIL looked at YOU and asked \u201cwhere\u2019s my gift?\u201d  She did not look at her son.  \n\nThe issue here is that you post hit a lot of nerves.  Women are fed up with doing all the emotional labor in their relationships.  They are tired of in-laws who are never satisfied.  Your story is the same story that tens of thousands of us wives had 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago.  We were you, and now we are reading this with 20/20 hindsight.  \n\nYour husband might be a great guy.  Your MIL could be otherwise wonderful.  But even the most sincere people have their blind spots, prejudices, and assumptions that lure them into traps.  This is one of those traps!!!\n\nSo there it is - you\u2019ve been forewarned!", "Then common curtesy would have been to thank OP for the gift, then ask for the receipt to exchange the gift for a tv that would suit them better. I\u2019ve done it a hundred times with items that were purchased for me but didn\u2019t fit or weren\u2019t my style. \n\nBut the most important thing is to still show gratitude for the effort, thought and expense that someone went to for you.", "I clearly said MIL's behavior was bad.  She handled everything is about the worst way possible. \n\nI was just pointing out that the assumption that the gift was what she wanted might be incorrect.  The person I replied to said \"She absolutely wanted it\", I was pointing out that we don't know that the \"huge smart TV\" OP purchased was something the MIL wanted.\n\nThe MIL is clearly an AH here, I was not debating that.", "I love this idea. You get to stick it to her while also supporting a good cause."]}
