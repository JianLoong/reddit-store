Then MIL ask but where is my present.  She clearly doesn't appreciate what she gets even when it is exactly what she asked for. I agree that it would cause tension if you don't get her anything and that you have to think if you really want to go through that if you could just buy a scented candle or something. However nobody has a right to gifts and in my opinion the MIL doesn't deserve one either. Beside that OP says she doesn't want to go out and buy something but isn't stopping her husband from doing so. Since OP is already getting all the other presents that they give his family. Why can't the husband handle the present for his mother.", "Lmao no. Why should she get her anything? She clearly doesn't appreciate it.", "She got a 300$ TV last year and her first reaction was, but where is my gift since this was something that others could also use so she didn't think it was good enough. And after that she just gave it away. Like OP said, she can do with her present what she wants. However it's still disrespectful. But especially saying she wanted another present after getting a huge present already. This MIL needs to learn that you get what you get and you don't get upset. Because people don't owe you presents and if you are ungrateful you might not get anything at all.", "Did you read over the part where the MIL said but where is my present after receiving the TV. I think that is very disrespectful. You don't appreciate the gift because others could also use it, even though you got the most expensive gift", "I\u2019m sure I could ask my husband to buy her something himself, but here\u2019s the thing\u2026 he really has a lot of strengths, but picking out gifts is not one of them, which is why I mainly do it- most people tell me I am pretty good at finding thoughtful presents to give. I\u2019m sure she would know right away if I picked out all of the other presents and she got something my husband picked out, and it might hurt her feelings just the same", "I don't think I typed it out correctly, you weren't the TA for giving it, they were the TA for giving it away! You've don't nothing wrong and I wouldn't buy your mil a present again either.", "Look, this is one of those things that can be forgotten about in a month after buying something like a candle holder, or it can be the start of a recurring Christmas feud that lasts for decades. Because like it or not, this woman is most likely in OPs life until she and hubby get divorced or MIL dies. Learn the lesson, buy a cheaper gift, but passing out presents to other people in the family and deliberately ignoring MIL will be received as the double middle finger it is, and as good as that might feel right now, I promise you it won't be worth it. \n\n(Side note: I'm assuming this is a situation where each individual family member buys gifts for each other individual. If they're giving gifts as a couple, then hubby can just pick out the candle holder.)", "Maybe then she will appreciate more how nice your gifts are of you politely tell her that since your present last year was a miser you though that you let your husband choose her gift since he knows her better. Then if she doesn't like the gift she might realize how nice you are for putting in the time, effort and money to find her an amazing gift every year.", "\"Husband picked it out, we thought you might appreciate the gesture.\"", "So what? It's your husband who wants to give her a gift, so he should get her the gift.\n\nNTA", "Practice makes perfect, its a lame excuse to be honest", "Wow, I think this comment may have been exactly what I needed, thank you. I guess I was so wrapped up in how much she hurt my feelings giving that gift away that I didn\u2019t even consider that my motive for not giving her one might be exactly what you said - a double middle finger to her- basically just my attempt to hurt her feelings in return, and that makes me feel like maybe I am TA here."]}
