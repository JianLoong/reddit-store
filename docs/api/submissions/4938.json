Then MIL ask but where is my present.  She clearly doesn't appreciate what she gets even when it is exactly what she asked for. I agree that it would cause tension if you don't get her anything and that you have to think if you really want to go through that if you could just buy a scented candle or something. However nobody has a right to gifts and in my opinion the MIL doesn't deserve one either.

And after that she just gave it away. Like OP said, she can do with her present what she wants. However it's still disrespectful. But especially saying she wanted another present after getting a huge present already. This MIL needs to learn that you get what you get and you don't get upset. Because people don't owe you presents and if you are ungrateful you might not get anything at all.", "Did you read over the part where the MIL said but where is my present after receiving the TV.

Because like it or not, this woman is most likely in OPs life until she and hubby get divorced or MIL dies. Learn the lesson, buy a cheaper gift, but passing out presents to other people in the family and deliberately ignoring MIL will be received as the double middle finger it is, and as good as that might feel right now, I promise you it won't be worth it. \n\n(Side note: I'm assuming this is a situation where each individual family member buys gifts for each other individual. If they're giving gifts as a couple, then hubby can just pick out the candle holder.)", "Maybe then she will appreciate more how nice your gifts are of you politely tell her that since your present last year was a miser you though that you let your husband choose her gift since he knows her better.

Why did she not tell your husband or her other kids? You do see you're being walked on right? I'm glad you're sticking to your guns. His mom his problem.

Not your mum, not your responsibility.", "NTA. Your husband can buy his own mother's gift. It's not unfair, whether she gets something is entirely up to him and whether he cares enough to do the work.

Your MIL was extremely ungrateful for the expensive and thoughtful gift you got her and I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to get her anything. If your husband wants her to have a gift that badly he can pick something out for her himself.

And it was very very clear they put no thought at all into this gift.  Especially when my husband, stepson, and daughter (their bio granddaughter/niece) got actual, thought out gifts.  \n\nBut more importantly, women should not be held accountable for the emotional work in a marriage just because we have vaginas.  \n\n13 years later and I still don\u2019t CHOOSE the gifts for his family.

Technically, MIL (or anyone for that matter) has the right to do whatever they want with a gift they\u2019ve been given. But, honestly, I would have been pissed too if I were in your position. Especially because you worked extra to get her something she said she needed. Likewise, you also have the right to decide who you want to buy gifts for and who you don\u2019t. So, I\u2019m voting NAH. I am wondering though\u2026is it worth the conflict that will inevitably be caused when you buy gifts for everyone else and not her? Also - does she buy you gifts? Maybe the solution is to get her something smaller this year to even out the extra amount that you gave her last year (?)", "NTA.  You are not stopping your husband from buying his mother a gift, are you?  Why in the world is this your job?  Trust me dear, you really don\u2019t want the responsibility of trying to make his mom happy for the next 50 years.  His mom will be more appreciative of gifts that she knows her son thought about and purchased.\n\nI recommend that you and your husband agree on a $ limit for these gifts, and then each do the shopping for your own relatives.  He chooses, purchases, wraps and hands over the gifts \u201cfrom both of you\u201d to his relatives, and you do the same for yours.
