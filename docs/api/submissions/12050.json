I simply said, \u201cyou were being dishonest. Others work for their grades while you took a short cut. You made your bed now lie in it.\u201d Currently, he\u2019s blasted me on all social media for it. His parents are furious and has threatened legal action against me.

Better for him to see reality now and not later in life.", "NTA he was already reported but now he's  placing all the blame on you.", "Nta, from what you said they already knew he was cheating and were probably in the evidence collection phase.

And if so are the other subjects going to be relevant to his planned career **and** critical to the wellbeing of others? \n\n3) Did his mom realise her assistance is being used to cheat, or did she think she was helping her son study and 'improving' his work? \n\nI can't see the answer to q3 will make a difference to the verdict, but I am just really intrigued since his mom is a teacher and should understand that a cheater is not going to learn the subject well.", "Just a question: why this time for reporting?

I\u2019m glad he got kicked out but it would have taken a lot more than one report to make that happen. It\u2019s not on you.

You say you only really figured out he was cheating on Monday. But you also say you found out a few months ago. And you also say you know his mom has done the majority of all the work for him, implying that you must have had some idea that she was involved right from the beginning of the course.\n\nI think you're intentionally fudging this detail because you know that if you reported him immediately after seeing him cheat, that's very different than knowing that he was cheating and not confronting him for a few months before suddenly deciding to throw him to the dogs.\n\nReporting a cheat is fair enough. Doing it to someone who thought they were your friend, unexpectedly, without warning, after knowing about it for some time - that's just not how you would treat someone if you were actually their friend. But of course, plainly cheating in front of someone who is working hard to try to get a good result is also not how you should treat someone if they are actually your friend.\n\nESH", "YTA, it was not your business if he was cheating or not.

Desperate idiots find all sorts of ways to sue. Just look at Judge Judy and such.", "They could claim that OP cost them the tuition money that has now been wasted since the \"friend\" got kicked out of school. While it is in no way OPs fault that they lost it, that's a measurable financial loss they they suffered as a result of this mess. \n\nWhile I agree that no lawyer worth their law degree would take on the case, a semester's tuition could very easily fall under the limit for small claims court, depending on where they are located and what school they were attending. \n\nAnd filling a motion to dismiss is responding. Will it go to trial? Likely not. Would they win on the exceedingly slim chance that it does go to trial? Almost certainly not. But they could cause OP lots of aggravation by filling a suit and serving him, which would mean he'd then want to consult an attorney, and would have to get the motion to dismiss filed, and possibly attend that pretrial hearing. While attending school that might not be in the jurisdiction where the suit is filled since the parents would likely file it where they live. I'm not sure why you think all that wouldn't be much of a headache, but for most people, it would be. Heck, I think it would be a huge aggravation, and I work for a law firm so consulting a lawyer is as easy as catching them when they walk past my desk.\n\nNow, are the parents likely to follow through? Probably not, especially if they consult a lawyer about it. But the possibility exists.", "OP says it's a curve graded.", "I thought so too, but even then it's a massive stretch. There's no way they'd be able to establish a prima facie case. They'd also have to prove that OP's complaint was the main reason he got kicked out, not the other reports from professors. \n\nJudge Judy is also notorious for being scripted and hiring actors to pass off as real arbitration cases. \n\nBut hey, props to the parents for being so delusional they can sue someone else because they help their son cheat through uni. That's a special kind of skill.", ">They could claim that OP cost them the tuition money that has now been wasted since the \"friend\" got kicked out of school. While it is in no way OPs fault that they lost it, that's a measurable financial loss they they suffered as a result of this mess. \n\nYeah, that would be the most likely claim, you have to have suffered a loss that came directly from the defamatory statement. There are other players here (the professors who had made previous formal complaints about the issue) and they wouldn't be able to prove it was OP's tip that lead to the expulsion. \n\n\n>And filling a motion to dismiss is responding\n\nYes and no. It is responding in the literal sense? Yeah. But a motion to dismiss is not considered the same as a legal response in most US states. \n\n>But they could cause OP lots of aggravation by filling a suit and serving him, which would mean he'd then want to consult an attorney, and would have to get the motion to dismiss filed, and possibly attend that pretrial hearing.\n\nMaybe I'm just a sucked for punishment and rubbing stuff in people's face because it doesn't seem like a massive aggravation to me. Finding a lawyer is the hard part. Once you've got one, filing and drafting motions to dismiss are smooth sailing. They also may not have to attend a pretrial conference depending on where they're at. Some states only require attorneys to be present. I think (but can't be sure) there's also certain grounds for not attending in person. \n\nBut hey, thanks for the discussion. It's always nice being able to practise the legalese.", "While I appreciate the whole rubbing stuff in people's faces bit, I have ADHD, so the whole deadline part of dealing with a suit against me would be a huge headache, and an even bigger one since it's already be annoyed at the situation being discussed. It's silly in my case since as I said, I work with the lawyers so literally all I'd have to do is bring in the paperwork I got served with and they and the paralegals would handle the rest, but that's what it is. Just shows that everyone reacts differently to these situations."]}
