It\u2019s not a hard school to get into, it\u2019s a 97% acceptance rate. We both take most of the same courses because we share the same major. I try to make the best grades I can, but sometimes I get a B average. It\u2019s not the best, but at least I\u2019ve passed and put the effort into it. \n\nRonald has a very big issue with academics. He doesn\u2019t study at all, and ends up cheating on tests and quizzes because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know the material.\u201d His mother is fluent in Spanish and is a teacher. He\u2019s gotten her to do majority of his Spanish work leaving him to not know grammar rules and various other things revolving around the language. All of our tests are online except one of our communications class. All these tests are without lockdown browser. So you can freely search the internet or just use your phone.\n\nMidterms are this week. His last test was wednesday and he had his mom on FaceTime doing the test. He was visiting my dorm and realized he needed to take his test before it closed officially. I got upset and didn\u2019t even talk to him as I called the office for academic dishonesty. I stepped out into the hallway, disclosed everything, and once they finished the report they thanked me and hung up. \n\nNow flash forward to today, he got an email and phone call from the office saying he has been kicked from the university for his academic dishonesty. It turns out his professors had already brought up the issue with the office. He called me and was screaming that \u201cyou called the fucking Dean and kicked me out of the fucking university\u201d. I simply said, \u201cyou were being dishonest. Others work for their grades while you took a short cut. You made your bed now lie in it.\u201d Currently, he\u2019s blasted me on all social media for it. His parents are furious and has threatened legal action against me. A few of our mutual friends said I should\u2019ve just stayed out of it even if it was a shitty thing for him to do. \n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting him?", "created_utc": 1678568400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ouye7/aita_for_reporting_my_friend/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On what grounds?? He probably would've gotten expelled regardless of your call and for that behavior at any school he attended, given that's usually one of their top policies. Plus, it's really on them for literally helping him do the cheating, so... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. He was going to get caught eventually especially since his professor stuck in a report. His mom should be ashamed for literally endorsing his cheating.", "NTA. It's critical that you reported him. If the university found out that you knew he was cheating and didn't report him, there could have been consequences for you. \n\nAnd if they want to threaten legal action, let them. They'll get laughed out of court.", "NTA. He got what he deserves. The fact that his parents think they could sue you is hilarious.", "NTA - His mom can't hold his hand through every step of life. Better for him to see reality now and not later in life.", "NTA he was already reported but now he's  placing all the blame on you.", "Nta, from what you said they already knew he was cheating and were probably in the evidence collection phase. Your evidence was a small piece of the final decision. Sounds like his parents are making a rod for their own backs by enabling him through cheating and dishonesty rather than working for something. \nHis mom will be lucky to keep her job if she's aided in academic dishonestly, potentially even fraud if she's actively helping him give false information for his personal gain.\nAlso I don't know much about the law in countries outside the UK, but people can't sue a witness for them being caught doing something wrong.", "NTA, his dishonesty is what got him thrown out, not you. \nAs for his mother, a teacher, do you really think she wants a case going to court where she helped her son cheat in assessments?! I really doubt it\u2019s going to happen. Rest easy and enjoy your course", "nta cheater got what he deserved", "NTA. And legal action? That speaks volumes about their ethics!", "INFO: Are you saying our university simply threw him out - on a weekend, no less - without a hearing or an opportunity to defend himself?", "INFO: \n\n1) Are you graded on a curve?  \n\nThe reason I ask is, if you are, and he is scoring highly due to his cheating, then his cheating is directly affecting your grade and the grades of others on your course by pushing you down fractionally. \n\n2) Is he cheating on all his work, or just the Spanish?  And if so are the other subjects going to be relevant to his planned career **and** critical to the wellbeing of others? \n\n3) Did his mom realise her assistance is being used to cheat, or did she think she was helping her son study and 'improving' his work? \n\nI can't see the answer to q3 will make a difference to the verdict, but I am just really intrigued since his mom is a teacher and should understand that a cheater is not going to learn the subject well.", "Just a question: why this time for reporting? It seems like you knew he cheated on basically everything from your second paragraph.", "NTA. Professor here. You did the right thing.", "What legal action?? LOL! That's pretty funny. Remind mom that she could lose her job if they try.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - Really this is all on him, he cheated, he has to pay the consequences of that. I don't like cheaters and think calling them out is what people should do. You should have done this sooner.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad he got kicked out but it would have taken a lot more than one report to make that happen. It\u2019s not on you. You and he will be operating under a code of conduct and perhaps he can now reflect on his own conduct  once he stops trying to blame everyone but himself. College is about learning, not grades. Ignore the people here who side with a fraud.", "If your graded on a curve then I don\u2019t blame you at all", "NTA he was probably already done for anyway and to those people saying he\u2019ll struggle to get into another school or get a job now I just say good. He made his bed now he can lie in it", "To be honest, looking at the OP and your additional comments, I feel like you're being a little disingenuous with how you present the situation. You say you only really figured out he was cheating on Monday. But you also say you found out a few months ago. And you also say you know his mom has done the majority of all the work for him, implying that you must have had some idea that she was involved right from the beginning of the course.\n\nI think you're intentionally fudging this detail because you know that if you reported him immediately after seeing him cheat, that's very different than knowing that he was cheating and not confronting him for a few months before suddenly deciding to throw him to the dogs.\n\nReporting a cheat is fair enough. Doing it to someone who thought they were your friend, unexpectedly, without warning, after knowing about it for some time - that's just not how you would treat someone if you were actually their friend. But of course, plainly cheating in front of someone who is working hard to try to get a good result is also not how you should treat someone if they are actually your friend.\n\nESH", "YTA, it was not your business if he was cheating or not. With friend's like you, who needs enemies.", "[deleted]", "ESH - Ronald for obvious reasons, and you for calling the office before trying to talk to him and convince him to be honest. If he was a random stranger, sure, but you said he was your friend.", "Nta.  They wouldn't just take your word for it and kick him out, you were just one nail in his self made coffin.", "Absolutely NTA.  I cannot respect people who can abide cheating.", "ESH. You suck, too, not for reporting him, but for making up this story or leaving major parts out. There is zero chance that any university kicked someone out for academic dishonesty without giving him a chance to present his side of the story & defend himself.", "YTA and you are not his \u201cfriend.\u201d You also are jealous.\n\nIt\u2019s lame of him to cheat but he\u2019s cheating himself. You should have ignored it instead of severely and negatively impacting his life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
