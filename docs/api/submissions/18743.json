We've known her since we were babies and she is essentially my female best friend. They started dating when he was a freshman and she was a sophomore and they got purity rings together to promise to not have sex until they are married. To answer your question, yes, we are catholic.\n\nRecently, we have moved closer to the university we all go to and my parents invited \"Jane\" to live with us. This got weird when I started noticing my brother washing his bed sheets more than usual. They also been showering together. I confronted him about it and we admitted that while they weren't having regular p and v sex, they were doing other things. He said that it was normal because they were young and hormonal. This sparked a fight, where I regretfully ended up calling his fianc\u00e9e a whore and he called me a hypocrite because I'm not a virgin.\n\nI ended telling my parents, which put them in shock. My mom got very mad, insinuating that \"Jane\" pushed her little baby to do such things. \"Jake\" got defensive saying that it was mostly him that suggested those things and that he's old enough to make those decision. My mom swiftly apologized, but \"Jane\" was already bawling her eyes out and left.\n\n\"Jane\" is now staying at her friend's house out of embarrassment. My parents believe that I was in the wrong for not respecting my brother's boundaries and that they didn't need to know. My brother is mad at me and is considering not making me his best man at his wedding. Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add this, but I\u2019m a virgin.
