To lock her in a room with armed guards who will tackle her if she tries to leave?", "NTA for objecting to her walking into a scenario that sounds like the setting of a horror movie.

Her safety is more important than her feelings and everything about this absolutely screams danger.", "NTA, completely understand why you and your parents would stop her from going, but to be fair, she is an adult and if she is going to make bad choices despite being advised against it by older and more mature adults around her, then unfortunately she will need to learn some lessons on her own. And it's scary because she could seriously get hurt or worse but if she doesn't understand what the problem acutally is she is going to continue to make similar mistakes.", "NTA. Your sister on the other hand is A H. I loved how she outed herself to your parents.", "NTA - you gave the parameters for her to go to the camping trip, she refused those parameters. She's the one annihilating her social life, and maybe that's a good thing.

Nothing's actually stopping her from going other than, I suppose, you following through on your non-threat and shipping her back to your parents.\n\nTechnically-legally it's not any of your business but in this case I mostly think it is since you are family (and you're the elder or more mature one), she is a young adult, she is a guest in your home, and she is doing something with obvious risks.

So what if they uninvite \"Some\" sketchy people? There are still a dozen more probably, of whom which you probably have no clue about, and likely some males as well, as it was being said as \"Sketchy people\". Also, your sister even though being an adult, is living with you, and its your rules under your roof, unless she could afford to life off alone.\n\nAlso, lying to your parents is never a good idea...

Every kid in my high school would drink and party out in the woods and not a single one of us got trafficked. You are a conservative puritan who thinks sex is wrong before marriage aren\u2019t you", "I don't see anything in the OP that suggests the concern is that she might have sex. I think the issue is doing three potentially dangerous things at once--going to a remote wilderness location, going to an unknown location without communication equipment, and meeting people at a large social event who the sister herself describes as sketchy. The nature of the third risk is irrelevant. It is merely the addition of the third risk on top of the way the first two combine that makes an intervention reasonable.", "She's probably completely dependent, at least financially. I'm also getting some strong cultural-social constraint vibes.", "I would assume she\u2019s either the kind of person who still listens too her parents, could be a cultural thing (Im from the south where no matter your age you pretty much still listen to your mamma).

High schoolers and college kids all drink and have sex. Experimenting now will keep her out of trouble later when she\u2019s at a university party and she knows her limits around no one she knows.

Go ahead and look at my post/comment history and try to find a SINGLE instance of me being anything other than a hardcore leftist that's against religion and hates conservatives. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with drinking and partying in the woods. It's just important to keep yourself safe doing it.\n\nLeaving yourself without emergency communication options and intentionally putting yourself in company of people who creep you out isn't staying safe.\n\nWomen don't have sex with people ***they*** deem sketchy. She got creeped out by the people that are tagging along. Are you missing that part?", "Yeah, no. \n\nThere is partying and there is unsafe situations. \n\nI partied as a teen. I pushed boundaries but I also understood some rules were for safety. \n\nNo phones and sketchy individuals the sister barely knows? That is a giant red flag. The sister is putting herself in a dangerous situation with no way of contact.", "No just some good ole financial abuse", ">You tried to invalidate the point of my statement by being hooked up on the high school part instead of the spirit of what I said\n\nNo, it just makes it extra weird that you're so hung up on the prospect of her having sex if you thought you're talking about a minor.\n\nI'm saying she needs to have access to communication in case of emergency, and not put herself in company of people who creep her out when she's vulnerable, and you're responding \"BUT TEENAGERS NEED TO DO DRUGS AND HAVE SEX!\"\n\nAssuming that's what she's wanting to do.... the things I said are important for her safety STILL APPLY. There are safe and unsafe ways to party. I have this (apparently super controversial) opinion that it's preferable to do it the safe way.", "You've replied to every comment on this post about her having sex. Super creepy my man. You seem obsessed.", "She said some of them are. And sketchy isn\u2019t the same as creepy or Pervy it could be they\u2019re sketchy because they sell drugs, do drugs or any other number of things.

No one goes camping and stays sober and knits, so it\u2019s pretty disingenuous of you to suggest otherwise", "No one describes people they have a positive impression of and feel safe with as \"sketchy\". Absolutely no one describes someone they want to have sex with as \"sketchy\".\n\nI like that you now have dropped the \"puritan conservative\" nonsense though.  \n\nMaybe now you can realize that there are legitimate safety concerns beyond \"don't want teens haing sex\", in going with people you're uncomfortable with, without taking a phone with you just in case you need help?", "The brother was fine with her going camping but wanted her to bring a phone. She refused. He never mentions sex. You are creating a fantasy in your own head about a 19 year old girl and it's cringe.\n\nHaving a cell phone while camping is common sense.

But most young people spending their late teens and early 20s partying a little too much and sleeping with people they shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s the time of life where it\u2019s okay to experiment and live a little. Nothing you say can change my mind about that. I did it and every one I knew growing up did it and your either a puritan, super conservative, or on the spectrum if you disagree.", "How do you know she isn\u2019t really going to bring the phone but doesn\u2019t want her over bearing brother harassing her every 5 minutes while she trips on shrooms or acid?", ">And I think you have hidden motives for the opinions you have\n\nBased on.... what, exactly?\n\nI've cultivated a 2 year reddit post history of sex-positive, feminist, progressive ideology just so I could turn all puritan the moment a teenager goes camping? I MUST be puritan because I think a 19 year old should definitely take her phone if she's going to be vulnerable partying in the woods?\n\nNo buddy, sorry. You're massively projecting here. You probably are thinking about your own partying experience, the judgment you almost certainly got from said conservative puritans, and you're projecting that onto everyone who's not super gun-ho for this young woman to go without her phone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>... or on the spectrum if you disagree.\n\nLmao, so now you're ableist too?\n\nGive ONE good reason she should not take her phone with her in case of emergency. I'll wait.\n\nI think you have ulterior motives for being so hyperfocused on the prospect of a teen's sex life and wanting her to be without a means to communicate or ask for help. Super creepy dude.", "Again you are crafting a fantasy in your mind. I'm done entertaining your delusions, have a good one.", "Maybe she plans on doing shrooms or acid and doesn\u2019t want her over bearing brother blowing her shut up every 5 minutes. If she\u2019s going camping it\u2019s doubtful she\u2019ll even have service anyways. I\u2019m not a psychic and neither are you: maybe she does plan on bringing her phone but again doesn\u2019t want her brother and parents harassing her every two seconds", "Give me one good reason. Proceeds to call the reason a fantasy instead of being treated as a likely reason like you asked for. Nice bad faith argument bro", "All he asked of her was to *take* her phone. Idk if you camp much, but generally speaking you leave your phone off or in power save mode anyways. No one would expect her to be answering it. \n\n\"Take your phone in case of an emergency\" is an incredibly reasonable request, and the person who suggested no one do that to get the \"real experience\" is fucking sketchy."]}
