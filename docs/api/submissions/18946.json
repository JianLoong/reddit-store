After all, she is an adult.\n\nMy sister told our parents that she planned on hanging out with her friends for a few days and that they would not leave our city. Our parents thought it would be perfectly fine and agreed to it.\n\nThe problem started when my sister told me that she actually planned to go camping with some of her friends (F19, F20, and F20). I was cool with it and asked her to keep her cellphone on her so that she could call me if she needed to.\n\nShe said that she and her friends planned on leaving behind all technology as they wanted the fullest experience. I thought this was a bad idea and strongly recommended that at least one of them keep a phone, to which my sister responded, \"They'd think about it.\"\n\nThe day before the planned trip, my sister said that they'd be joined by several more people, some of whom she described as a little sketchy. I told her that was a really bad idea and that she and her friends should consider uninviting anyone they thought was sketchy. I also insisted that she take her phone.\n\nMy sister flat out refused all this and said I was being too controlling. I got annoyed and said that if she wasn't willing to compromise, then she wasn't going on that trip. She started yelling at me and called our parents, telling them that I was preventing her from seeing her friends.\n\nI told them how she planned on going camping with sketchy people, and my parents also refused to let her go. After the call ended, my sister started yelling at me again and said I was annihilating her social life. AITA?\n\nUPDATE - My sis and her friends were supposed to head out last night (however sis never went). This morning, my sis told me that 2 of her friends who planned on going canceled as well. This was because some guy in his 40s who they never met before somehow inserted himself into group of people going. Apparently, he was invited by someone.  \n\nThis man wanted to the leader of the group and planned on going somewhere more remote than was initially agreed upon. He then told my sis's friends that he would hold on to everyone's cell phone so that they could all get the most out of the trip and technology would't interfere.\n\nMy sis agrees that was \"a little\" creepy, but still says I'm an ass for \"snitching to mom and dad\" (even though she was the one who called in the first place)", "created_utc": 1685890161, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140fba1/aita_for_banning_my_younger_sister_from_camping/", "score": 711, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
