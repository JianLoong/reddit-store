As our parents live overseas, I've sort of been tasked with looking out for her. I try not to be overly protective and aim to be a \"cool\" older brother rather than a helicopter parent. After all, she is an adult.\n\nMy sister told our parents that she planned on hanging out with her friends for a few days and that they would not leave our city. Our parents thought it would be perfectly fine and agreed to it.\n\nThe problem started when my sister told me that she actually planned to go camping with some of her friends (F19, F20, and F20). I was cool with it and asked her to keep her cellphone on her so that she could call me if she needed to.\n\nShe said that she and her friends planned on leaving behind all technology as they wanted the fullest experience. I thought this was a bad idea and strongly recommended that at least one of them keep a phone, to which my sister responded, \"They'd think about it.\"\n\nThe day before the planned trip, my sister said that they'd be joined by several more people, some of whom she described as a little sketchy. I told her that was a really bad idea and that she and her friends should consider uninviting anyone they thought was sketchy. I also insisted that she take her phone.\n\nMy sister flat out refused all this and said I was being too controlling. I got annoyed and said that if she wasn't willing to compromise, then she wasn't going on that trip. She started yelling at me and called our parents, telling them that I was preventing her from seeing her friends.\n\nI told them how she planned on going camping with sketchy people, and my parents also refused to let her go. After the call ended, my sister started yelling at me again and said I was annihilating her social life. AITA?\n\nUPDATE - My sis and her friends were supposed to head out last night (however sis never went). This morning, my sis told me that 2 of her friends who planned on going canceled as well. This was because some guy in his 40s who they never met before somehow inserted himself into group of people going. Apparently, he was invited by someone.\n\nThis man wanted to the leader of the group and planned on going somewhere more remote than was initially agreed upon. He then told my sis's friends that he would hold on to everyone's cell phone so that they could all get the most out of the trip and technology would't interfere.\n\nMy sis agrees that was \"a little\" creepy, but still says I'm an ass for \"snitching to mom and dad\" (even though she was the one who called in the first place)\n\nEdit - For those wondering, we are from a socio-cultural group where kids (regardless of age) are kinda expected to listen to their parents. To their credit, our parents have never really enforced this and have allowed us to live without too many restrictions, so long as we don't harm other people or ourselves they would't interfere too much. \n\nMy sister is still dependent financially on our parents (and myself to an extent), however I never once used this to leverage my argument. Regardless of whatever bad decision she may make or fight she may have with our parents, my door is always open to her.\n\nAs of now, I sort of hiding in my room as my sister is still furious with me. I'll try talking to her once she cools down.", "created_utc": 1685890161, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140fba1/aita_for_banning_my_younger_sister_from_camping/", "score": 2213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm just genuinely not seeing amy connection.", "He said protective, not controlling, and explains that he feels like he's got to be responsible for her bc their parents are overseas so he's the only one physically looking out for her right now (she may have alao recently moved countries, which could contribute to feeling like he has to look out for her). It just seems like a regular struggle, adjusting to your newly adult sibling being under your care, especially if OP used to look after his sister when she was younger.", ">In that case it\u2019s better to have a discussion explaining why the trip sounds dangerous\n\nThat happened and was ignored? Even after her friends cancelled because they picked up on how dangerous it was, she still thinks it was \"mildly creepy\"", "What's interesting is that you laid out completely why your experiences were completely different\n\n1 - the oldest person there was trusted adult - a big brother or sister or something\n\n2 - fairly safe to assume that by \"huge camping parties\" people who weren't there knew your rough whereabouts...not necessarily within spitting distance but they'd know sort of down to a 1 by 1 mile grid or so\n\n3 - senior high schoolers and early college/university people hanging out is a different vibe from early university hanging out with men who have nearly hit 50...you know it, I know it, there's 20 miles of difference between a 19 year old seeing a 17 year old (age of consent in England is 16 before certain words are used) and thinking of the fastest way to have her naked and breathing into his neck and a 40 year old seeing a 19 year old and having the same thoughts, one is innocent and natural, the other is predatory and creepy", "Pal. I grew up in Sweden, some of us basically live in the woods, drinking parties are very common. Teens have sex, it happens.\n\nBut this whole thing was sketchy AS HELL the VERY moment sis said they'd all leave their phones. You don't do that when you're new to camping. Even if you're not going to a party. Even if you're not drinking. Even if you're alone. But you ESPECIALLY don't do that if you're a 19 year old girl going to drink with a bunch of strangers in a remote area. Even if the edit about the 40-y-old came after you read it, I still don't think you should be this defensive about that. Stuff happens in the woods, and sometimes that stuff is bad. Bring yo phones. That's common sense.", "You you look at the time of my reply and the edit you\u2019d realize my comment was made before the info about the 40 year old was added into the op. You can\u2019t get your tits in a knot about that. Frankly it\u2019s odd you would bother to reply to a comment that was made before that info was added in.", "I don't think it's a far-fetched thought. Family dynamics matter in culture and I think there's enough of the story here to get a vibe of one way or another. The sister's response to the situation is enough imo to open up the possibility.", "A 25 year old forbidding a 19 year old sibling from doing something  is completely unheard of in my culture (but not in my mom\u2019s).", "OP updated. It's a cultural thing.", "I looked at how long ago this discussion happened and realized you probably didn't even see the update! My gosh I'm glad he stopped his sister from going, 40 year old dude taking teenage girls phones out in the woods? Isn't that a horror movie plot??", "Especially considering she\u2019s only 19! She\u2019s an adult by technicality, but still very young so it makes sense for OP to be more protective of her than if she were 23.", "Again the 40 year old wasn\u2019t in the op so you can\u2019t get upset or try to use it as ammo or a haha gotcha moment. So I\u2019m not sure why you keep bringing it up like it was relevant or something because at the time I nor anyone else knew about this 40 year old. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d allow her to go if she were my sister he sounds like a predator of the worse sorts.", ">What do you think a 19 year old is planning to do in the woods with a large group of friends and associates?\n\nMy ex boyfriend and 3 male friends went camping somewhere in Scotland every year to keep a tradition their dead friend started, they drank some, one of them smoked up, but judging that man's reaction to the time I asked him his thoughts on me popping a sneaky finger or 2 up there when he was nearly on the edge to amplify his orgasm they weren't reenacting broke back mountain.\n\n>Why are they so interested in being away from supervision and any way for people to contact them. \n\nUntil the sketchy Lord himself was introduced I'd have assumed drugs (although you should still 100% always always have a way to contact the outside world on camping trips - **ESPECIALLY** when drugs are involved) \n\nWhen this \"no means of contact/supervision\" is introduced by a man who sounds like he'd find camaraderie with Ted Bundy...", "Well, now OP updated to confirm it's a cultural thing, but my point had been that to me, there's so little evidence pointing to that compared to them just being from a strict family or something. A lot of American parents think they can control what their adult kids do or don't do, after all. I was curious to see what made them lean more toward it being cultural.", "I mean, he can *say* he forbids her all he wants, but we don't have any evidence that he can actually go through with it. I've read plenty of stories on here where American older siblings act like they can tell their younger siblings what to do. Of course, this is all a moot point now that OP made another edit.", "All I have to say is look at your post history and the subs you participate in. Let\u2019s not pretend like you are neural typical", "Well, yeah, but even SAYING \"he forbids her\" from doing stuff is weird from a white American POV. He's her brother not her father.\n\nHell not even my father forbade me from shit. My mom (Chinese) on the other hand, would pull shit like that frequently, AND with her younger siblings. She got pissy at my cousin's wedding because she wasn't allowed to give a speech as the \"oldest member of the groom's side\" even though she's a random auntie to my cousin.", "What do you want to bet this chick pokes holes in condoms and gets men black out drunk but then says things like women can\u2019t rape men", "I think I would rather talk to someone who posts in WarriorCats, Birding, and Drawing subreddits over someone who makes 20+ comments in one AITA thread insisting OP is obsessed with his sister having sex.", "Interest in Art and Nature and such is neurodivergent now? Isn't that like 98% of people - hell its actually moreso stereotyped that autistic people prefer concrete jungles and can't really \"get\" abstract/surrealist art and such and want more photorealistic art...", ">Maybe she plans on doing shrooms or acid\n\nThe 2 drugs where you need a positive headspace and only people you explicitly trust around you while you trip? If anyone ever uses \"sketchy\" as a descriptor of the people they take hallucinogenics with - you forbid them, mother, daughter, father, son, brother, sister, friends, acquaintances, strangers.\n\nThe most dangerous thing you can do on hallucinogenics is end up on a bad trip with people you can't trust to help you"]}
