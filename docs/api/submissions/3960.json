We made plans to go dress shopping together and I was super excited. \n\nMIL has never liked me.

I like things very girly and traditional, and MIL thinks I'm so boring. I didn't want her to have any role in wedding planning mainly do to that.\n\nHowever my mom and MIL are friends and I respect that. They used to actually not like each other, but I think there was some underlying mutual respect like they met their match in each other, but my mom's fiance hates all of my mom's old friends (not in a controlling way, really nasty catty women and I don't think my mom even liked them) and he hangs out in the same friend group as MILs husband. \n\nI'm fine with them being friends. I was fine with my mom bringing a friend to the appointment (I brought two) but I was pissed when she rolled in with MIL. I immidiatley pulled my mom aside and was like what the hell. She said she threw MIL a birthday party last night, MIL was sleeping in the bed with her, and she couldn't sneak out without waking her, then somehow felt obligated to invite her (but later admitted she loved both of MILs weddings and wants her opinion)\n\nMIL was annoying during the whole thing. She gave my mom a lot of praise, but just was like meh at every dress I tried on, told me ball gowns aren't flattering on me, told me her son wasn't going to like the dresses I picked, and said the dresses remind her of that show my super sweet 16. Needless to say I was pissed. She also gave my friend terrible relationship advice.\n\nThe moment I was alone with my mom I snapped at her that she ruined the experience and maybe I shouldn't include her in anything else wedding related as she ruined this for me. I said maybe she should show up at my wedding and be treated like a regular gift. I called her selfish and accused her of doing it on purpose as MIL didn't even need a birthday party the night before. It wasnt even a milestone birthday.
