I\u2019ve apologized to her, we\u2019ve talked, and we have made up under the promise that we will work as a team from now on, and I will consult her on anything that involves her, particularly with her own family.\n\nAs for the elephant in the room\u2026\n\nMy wife has always recognized her mother as a bit of an AH since our son was born, but has constantly operated under the \u201cbut she\u2019s family\u201d pretence/excuse. Now, particularly with the help of these replies, as I explain it to her in a way that revolves more around our children than us, I feel she is beginning to come around to my viewpoint - which is one of wanting to protect our children at all costs, and to cut this harmful figure out of our lives. \n\nShe does not want to cut her mother entirely out of her life, but has promised to, if it is our wishes, prevent her from seeing our son and I (effectively only keeping contact between my wife and her mother). I told her I felt that would be best, and she told me that in that case, it would only be her talking to her mother. \n\nShe has also scheduled to go to therapy/counselling to better grasp the situation and understand where she should go next. She tried inviting her mother, but she vehemently refused, so it\u2019s just my wife for now.\n\nI now feel as though there\u2019s a huge weight that\u2019s been lifted off of my shoulders, and can finally look forward to the birth of my daughter in March without any connotations or drag-downs.\n\nThank you again, guys, for all the replies. I honestly would never have been able to articulate my viewpoint to her if it wasn\u2019t for you and your thoughtful replies. You\u2019ve made this situation 100x better, so I thank you again.", "created_utc": 1672116564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw6yov/update_on_my_abusive_mil_and_banning_her_from/", "score": 226, "replies": ["Yay!\nIt's nice to see these updates.
