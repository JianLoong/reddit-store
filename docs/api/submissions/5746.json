I\u2019ve apologized to her, we\u2019ve talked, and we have made up under the promise that we will work as a team from now on, and I will consult her on anything that involves her, particularly with her own family.\n\nAs for the elephant in the room\u2026\n\nMy wife has always recognized her mother as a bit of an AH since our son was born, but has constantly operated under the \u201cbut she\u2019s family\u201d pretence/excuse. Now, particularly with the help of these replies, as I explain it to her in a way that revolves more around our children than us, I feel she is beginning to come around to my viewpoint - which is one of wanting to protect our children at all costs, and to cut this harmful figure out of our lives. \n\nShe does not want to cut her mother entirely out of her life, but has promised to, if it is our wishes, prevent her from seeing our son and I (effectively only keeping contact between my wife and her mother). I told her I felt that would be best, and she told me that in that case, it would only be her talking to her mother. \n\nShe has also scheduled to go to therapy/counselling to better grasp the situation and understand where she should go next. She tried inviting her mother, but she vehemently refused, so it\u2019s just my wife for now.\n\nI now feel as though there\u2019s a huge weight that\u2019s been lifted off of my shoulders, and can finally look forward to the birth of my daughter in March without any connotations or drag-downs.\n\nThank you again, guys, for all the replies. I honestly would never have been able to articulate my viewpoint to her if it wasn\u2019t for you and your thoughtful replies. You\u2019ve made this situation 100x better, so I thank you again.", "created_utc": 1672116564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw6yov/update_on_my_abusive_mil_and_banning_her_from/", "score": 1267, "replies": ["Yay!\nIt's nice to see these updates. I know things are not perfect but I am glad things are moving in the right direction for your family. \nThe most joyous new year to you!", "Kind of shocked at how well that went for you. Good luck... I expect this won't be over and the MIL will be even more difficult to deal with. You're going to need all you can get.", "So glad to see y\u2019all getting ahead of this now before your 2 kids notice the difference in how MIL treats them. You\u2019ll need to have a unified plan for holidays and gift giving/receiving and you\u2019re well on your way.", "Most stories are of the man having to choose between wife and mother.  This is the other side.  She needs to choose.", "NTA\n\nI remember a time when my stepmother and I were involved in a major confrontation. My dad pulled me aside and told me that if it came down to choosing sides, he would side with her every time.\n\nYou've learned the same lesson. You and your wife are a team and need to communicate before making big decisions involving each other's family members.", "Depending on how insane MIL is, have you considered getting security cameras?", "Glad to see its working out.\n\nYour MIL is definitely TA.", "> She has also scheduled to go to therapy/counselling to better grasp the situation and understand where she should go next.\n\nDon't forget treatment for the two of you being sex addicts! /s", "really glad this all worked out! your MIL is such a toxic force of nature from what you\u2019ve described and I can only imagine your family\u2019s future being brighter from going low contact. happy for you!", "seems this is what mil wanted all along.", "There\u2019s a lot of sad stories on Reddit that came out of situations like your first paragraph but I\u2019m glad it worked out ok for you", "Be watchful for your MIL trying to pull gross favoritism for your daughter. Like only buying gifts for her or whatever, even if yiu tell her not to buy anything or return all the gifts.", "Good for you. \nBut its important that when mil whants to reconzile you don't allow her contact with the children.", "Yay! It's nice to see these kinds of updates. I bet that MIL definitely won't be happy with your decision, OP. Have you invested in any form of security? You never know how insane MIL's can be, especially the one's on this sub", "There's usually an \"extinction burst\" -- kind of like when a toddler realizes that crying isn't working, so they ramp up as hard as possible into a full-blown tantrum.", "Love this update OP!  Best of luck with your wife\u2019s family in the future!", "Good update, glad it worked out as well as it did. \n\nINFO: please explain your thought process in not discussing it with your wife before unilaterally uninviting her mother from Christmas.", "Lol. My son isn't too that stage yet but I'm dreading it.", "Growing up, I never defended myself against my dad when he made insults or jokes at my expense. He was my dad, so I just accepted it. When my kids were little and he started in on them, I immediately called him out on it. When he didn\u2019t stop, I went LC with him myself and he had NC with the kids except for large family events. I. Those cases, he usually behaved because my grandma was there. It\u2019s funny how many people don\u2019t discover their backbone or boundaries until they have kids. Myself included.", "What a good update, OP.   What struck me about your initial post was that MIL had been nice until your son was born.   One reason it might be hard for your wife to get her head around this and put a stop to it is that it represents such a change and your wife had hoped it will go back to a pleasant relationship by itself. The second  thing that struck me was you both \"giving her hundreds of chances\" before you blew up.  My mom used to do that with my dad. Something would be driving her crazy but she wouldn't say anything for a long time, just sucking it up, until she finally blew up and put her foot down. This left my dad thinking that my mom was arbitrary and controlling. (\"She never said it was a problem before...\") Everyone else could see he was a difficult person to live with because of some of his habits.   Later, she learned about setting boundaries (not easy in your 50s)  and while it was hard for a bit,  eventually their marriage got much much better.  \n\n It is quite possible that after your wife sets boundaries for a while,  your MIL will get the message that she can have any opinion she wants, but she cannot continue to dislike a child or disregard you for a decision that is in the past.  \n\nAnyway, this is just to say, congratulations! You did all the best things and it looks like good things are in the future for this situation.", "The no contact goes for the new kid as well right? Your MIL is going to absolutely do favoritism like crazy- you can\u2019t expose either of your kids to that.", "OP never go bad if your wife breaks the agreement stand firm, their mother treats your children badly and your wife is not going to protect them so do it yourself, good luck", "your story intrigues me", "Happy cake day!", "Every stage has its challenges and perks. Toddler tantrums can be super draining, but they also become little people with thoughts and opinions that can communicate. Every stage is temporary, for better or worse. You got this!", "Thank you.  I appreciate you saying that", "**\u201cbut she\u2019s family\u201d pretence/excuse.**\n\n\nFucking called it! God I hate these people. They're like tumors the only way to deal with them is to remove them.", "A few months ago I decided to cut my dad out of my life. Long story, but I got fed up being around someone who aggravated me beyond reason. Lots of discussion with my therapist before and after.\n\nWe tolerate MUCH more from family because of the social contract, whereas a friend who pulled the shit your MIL did would have been booted out of your lives long ago. This is what your wife needs to get her head around. \n\nNTA. All the best.", "Especially MIL will most likely favor the granddaughter over the grandson as she will be born after marriage as opposed to before their marriage. OP needs to keep granddaughter away from MIL until she can can treat the kids equally.", "I hope you have an Aries baby. Good luck!", "That feels super shitty though for you as the KID. This is different because it\u2019s her mother, not her child she\u2019s cutting off.", "Indeed, this sounds very promising. I hope we'll get an update in a year or so from a happy family!", "It seems like nothing because there's no context. It's easy (and normal) to side with the kid, but there are plenty of kids who hate step parents for no reason... Plenty of those on this sub.", ">Every stage is temporary, for better or worse.\n\nHere I am, trying to apply that to my fully grown ass...\n\nIt's still not any less accurate, though. Wise words."]}
