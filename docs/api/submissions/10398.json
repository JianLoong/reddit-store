{"id": 10398, "submission_id": "116mbvv", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for the takeout I \"forced\" my partner to order?", "selftext": "\"Forced\" is their words, not mine.\n\nI saw another AITA about cooking and it made me think of my situation from a couple weeks back. I don't think I was being the AH, but my partner is still mad about it. Posting from a throwaway account as mutual friends are on Reddit.\n\nLast month my (32) company announced that we would be laying people off. I was in the office that day and it was awful. Person after person was brought into HR, told they were being separated, and escorted out of the office. After they were done, they called a second meeting and told those of us left that the layoffs were over. A lot of the people I work with were let go. I texted my partner (32) after both announcements. Once to tell them about the layoffs and then to tell them I was \"safe\". In the second text I also told them I would not be home until late. My team had decided to stay late and figure out how to redistribute the work so that our projects wouldn't fail. We sat in a conference room and worked through all the projects and didn't leave until almost 9pm. Starting at about 8, my partner began texting me asking when I was getting home, what was for dinner, and that they were hungry. I kept replying that I didn't know when I would get to leave, that I would make dinner when I got home, and that if they were hungry they could make dinner or have a snack and wait.\n\nI didn't get home until almost 10 and found empty takeout containers in the kitchen. I asked if they had ordered takeout (they had), if they had ordered me any (they had not) and if they were still hungry (they were not). It was late and I was emotionally exhausted so I didn't eat and went straight to bed.\n\nThe next weekend, I found a Splitwise for their meal allocated 100% to me. Since we moved in together, we put all shared expenses like rent, bills, groceries, and takeout in Splitwise with a 70-30 split. Individual expenses, like if one of us buys lunch at work, do not go in Splitwise. I thought it was a mistake, so I deleted it. The next day they got mad at me for not paying for their takeout.\n\nAccording to them, it's my job to make dinner and my staying out late meant I didn't have dinner ready in a reasonable time. Since they were hungry, dinner wasn't ready, and they didn't know when dinner would be made, they were forced to order takeout. Because making dinner is my responsibility, I should pay for their takeout. My refusing to take responsibility and pay for their takeout makes me the AH.\n\nI don't think I am the AH because this was an extraordinary situation and we had food in the house they could have eaten. They chose to order $80+ in takeout for just themselves instead. Since they did not order any for me, it was not a shared expense and I don't feel I should have to pay for it.\n\nThey're still mad I won't pay for the takeout. They say I forced them to order it because I didn't make dinner by a reasonable time.\n\nADDED: There have been a lot of questions, see [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116mbvv/comment/j97imse/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for answers.", "created_utc": 1676836694, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116mbvv/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_the_takeout_i_forced/", "score": 1742, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This kind of behavior is a red flag", "Answers to some of the questions and comments:\n\n**How things got this way:** I'm not sure. We were together for several years before the pandemic but we only moved in together during the lockdown. When we were both working from home, we split chores and cooking equally. My partner had to go back to the office about 6 months before I did. Once they started going back to the office, they asked me to make dinner since I was \"home all day\". Going back to the office was really stressful for them, so I wasn't fussed about it. Plus, I only have to go in three days a week so, on days I'm working from home, I have time after work to cook, pick up the place, etc. Somehow, it turned into cooking dinner is my job, even after I had to go back to the office. I don't mind, because I usually enjoy cooking. So, I do the cooking, the grocery shopping, and the kitchen cleanup. They generally text me when they leave the office so I can have dinner and a clean house waiting for them when they get home.\n\n**Has this happened before:** No\n\n**Questions about the takeout:** The takeout they ordered was sushi, which can be very expensive. I don't know why they didn't order for me also, as I love sushi, but I'm guessing it was because sushi is really expensive and maybe they assumed I would eat at work?\n\n**Why we're together:** We're together because we love each other and have a great time together. They're usually really empathetic, but I know work has been stressful for them as they work in accounting and it's tax season.\n\n**Why the 70-30 split on bills:** When we moved in together, I made slightly twice what they made. We agreed to split all shared spending proportionally.\n\n**Kids:** No, we do not have kids.\n\nFinally, I find it weird that everyone is assuming I am female and my partner is male. I kept this gender neutral for a reason, and I'm not going to change that. I will say that at least 50% of the assumptions on gender are wrong.", "NTA you sound more like roommates than partners. And even a roommate wouldn\u2019t pull an AH move like your partner did. If your relationship is otherwise fine, this is a weird hill for them to die on.

NTA obviously, but why are you allowing them to treat you like this?", "Nta and it is a red flag they are even making you question this. In no universe are you TA.", "NTA unless to yourself. Hey, if they being a grown ass adult and completely healthy can't prepare a simple meal, wash their clothes and do other simple tasks - send them back to mum's, they are defective...", "Wow, there are so many things wrong with this relationship.  Why are you solely responsible for making dinner?  Why does your partner lack all compassion for you having a bad day?  Why are they unable to feed themselves?  Are they physically handicapped?  Why aren't you asking any of these questions yourself?  \n\nFind yourself a partner who when they find out you almost lost your job and are having a really stressful day responds by making you a delicious meal to come home to and listens to your problems instead of *being* your problem.", "NTA. First of all, $80 in takeout is excessive in the extreme, so this was a petty revenge situation. Second of all, even if dinner is part of your household responsibilities, this was an extenuating circumstance and a good partner is flexible because life doesn't always fit our plans.

Groceries, food, cleaning, phone calls, making her appointments. I basically wrote a paper for her the day of a deadline-- found all her citations for her and dragged a detailed outline from her one sentence at a time. Once she screamed at me for not somehow forcing her to fulfill a commission she'd agreed to for work (I did not work with her, was in law school, had reminded her several times of the deadline and gotten yelled at, but was apparently supposed to \"make her\" do it) so brutally that *her best friend* took me into the kitchen and hugged me when I started crying. \n\nEven she never treated me this badly, this dehumanizingly, with this total lack of empathy. \n\nAnother possible perspective: My mom was a SAHM, by agreement with my dad--initially she planned to continue working, but found that she loved being with us as babies and little kids and she and my dad agreed that it made financial sense for her to do it, so she did. When we got older, one of my sisters was still having frequent mental health crises, had chronic health issues, and needed help at doctors' appointments, and my parents had three dogs, so she kept staying home because issues cropped up so often, the dogs needed to go out, and it was just easier. In all those years---when we were little and she was super busy all the time, when we were teenagers and things were calmer, when we were adults back home visiting-- my dad has NEVER acted entitled to dinner and a clean house waiting when he got home. And like-- my dad is a hypercritical yeller about a lot of things. He's done a lot of work on his temper, but he absolutely has a temper, and sometimes he did not handle that in ways that were okay when we were growing up. He's yelled at my mom and gotten in arguments with her over stupid shit. He's yelled at us. But he's never DEMANDED dinner or acted like that if there wasn't something ready or the house was a mess. If he texted on the way and she said \"hey shit happened, not sure what's for dinner yet\" or he got home and there was chaos, he would just ask if everyone wanted takeout and order it and go pick it up or get it delivered. *Especially* if he knew she was already stressed out about something. I NEVER heard him say to her \"doing this is your job.\"  He would get mad and argue with everybody, including her, but he was never disrespectful to her like that and he was always very clear that he appreciated everything she did and relied on it and that her work was valuable and difficult and he was not entitled to it. \n\nAnd you're doing all this--cooking, cleaning the kitchen, groceries-- *and* paying the bills and your partner is being this entitled?

You need to split everything chores bills 50/50 or your being taken advantage of!", "The behaviour your partner showed in this case is just unacceptable. They're treating you like a servant who constantly needs to be at their beck and call, and spending no thought on your issues and your needs. I suggest having a very stern conversation with your partner and making them understand this childish behaviour must end immediately, or your relationship will suffer. \n\nYou say they're stressed due to work, well \\*you're\\* stressed due to work, yet you're the one worrying about making things easier on them, while they present the bill for a takeout they ordered because the babysitter was away, and they decided to sit on their ass instead of cooking their own meal.  The level of entitlement here is astounding.", ">but I know work has been stressful for them as they work in accounting and it's tax season.\n\nSo they're fully aware of how stress at work feels like and somehow can't muster the barest of empathy for you. How is this even excusable?", "How things got that way: because you were told that if you didn't do everything the way they wanted that you didn't love them. Working from home is still working. Just because you're not outside the house doesn't mean you suddenly have loads of time to do all the housework and cooking. If you didn't have a clean house and dinner waiting, what would be the fallout? Consider that question carefully, and ask yourself if it would be a reasonable response if it was the other way around, with you being the one in the office all the time and coming home to housework not done and dinner not made. If the answer is not the exact same as the way it is now, then there is a serious imbalance in the relationship.\n\nWhy you're together: Another one to consider, because the question in my mind is whether they actually love you and are actually empathetic, or if they are paying lip service to keep you happy and doing all the housework and cooking for them. It might well be tax season, but work should be left at work and work stress should be shaken off or shared during dinner and the washing up after, which should also be shared.\n\nThe split bills: Are you still earning that much more than your partner? Is it still a fair split of the money? If not, why has this not been readdressed when the financial situation changed?\n\nI'll be honest, I read your initial post and it screamed at me about a lot of red flags. But then I don't know the full ins and outs of your relationship. From your post though, it seems a bit one-sided: you have to cater to the fact that your partner is stressed during tax season, but they don't have to cater to your stress of nearly being let go at work (which would seriously impinge on your household spending, since the budget for it would decrease by two thirds if your job vanished), and having to try and work out how to spread the workload of the people who had been fired/made redundant.\n\nI may be wrong, but I feel they ordered sushi as a spite food. They spent eighty dollars on a meal for themselves because you weren't home to cook for them. They didn't ask if you wanted anything when they ordered. They didn't even clean up properly before you got home so you could see that they ordered in, ordered something you would love, but didn't bother ordering for you, because they were sulking about you not rushing home to cater for them. You said that previously the cooking was shared, but now they are suddenly incapable of making something for dinner, all because you have had a hell of a day at work that stretched out till late.\n\nYou work 5 days a week. Your partner works 5 days a week. Just because you get to do it from home two out of the five days doesn't suddenly mean you have to take on all the housework as well as your job, just because you are working from home. Your free time away from work doesn't magically increase enough to cover *all* the housework just because you don't have the extra twenty minute (random number) commute twice a week.\n\nThink about it for a while. Reverse the roles and see if you think it would be fair for you to treat your partner the way they have been treating you. If not, then it's time for a discussion about it, and a fairer division of labour in the house. And no more sulks just because you can't rush home to be a 50's housewife stereotype (no indication of your gender, just the stereotypical 50s housewife roles) to cater for their every whim, make their dinner, fetch their slippers, iron their newspaper, and all the other nonsense that they are perfectly capable of doing themselves.\n\nAnd if they order take-out because they can't be bothered picking up some slack while you have the stress and the long hours, then they pay for it. You are NTA. You didn't force them into ordering it.\n\nAnd it just occurred to me that if they actually said that you \"forced\" them to get take-out, you need to nip that in the bud. You didn't force them to do anything. They did it instead of cooking for themselves, because *they* could not be bothered. You didn't twist their arm, and press their fingers onto the phone or computer to do the ordering. You didn't hold them at gunpoint. You did NOT force anything. Remember that. The word \"forced\" was meant to make you feel guilty. And they ordered an expensive dish to spite you, since they assumed they would get away with making you pay for it.", "Funny, to me it seemed that OP is the man.", "**Petty**: leaves empty takeout containers in the kitchen so OP knows they had takeout and didn't get them any.
