{"id": 10398, "submission_id": "116mbvv", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for the takeout I \"forced\" my partner to order?", "selftext": "\"Forced\" is their words, not mine.\n\nI saw another AITA about cooking and it made me think of my situation from a couple weeks back. I don't think I was being the AH, but my partner is still mad about it. Posting from a throwaway account as mutual friends are on Reddit.\n\nLast month my (32) company announced that we would be laying people off. I was in the office that day and it was awful. Person after person was brought into HR, told they were being separated, and escorted out of the office. After they were done, they called a second meeting and told those of us left that the layoffs were over. A lot of the people I work with were let go. I texted my partner (32) after both announcements. Once to tell them about the layoffs and then to tell them I was \"safe\". In the second text I also told them I would not be home until late. My team had decided to stay late and figure out how to redistribute the work so that our projects wouldn't fail. We sat in a conference room and worked through all the projects and didn't leave until almost 9pm. Starting at about 8, my partner began texting me asking when I was getting home, what was for dinner, and that they were hungry. I kept replying that I didn't know when I would get to leave, that I would make dinner when I got home, and that if they were hungry they could make dinner or have a snack and wait.\n\nI didn't get home until almost 10 and found empty takeout containers in the kitchen. I asked if they had ordered takeout (they had), if they had ordered me any (they had not) and if they were still hungry (they were not). It was late and I was emotionally exhausted so I didn't eat and went straight to bed.\n\nThe next weekend, I found a Splitwise for their meal allocated 100% to me. Since we moved in together, we put all shared expenses like rent, bills, groceries, and takeout in Splitwise with a 70-30 split. Individual expenses, like if one of us buys lunch at work, do not go in Splitwise. I thought it was a mistake, so I deleted it. The next day they got mad at me for not paying for their takeout.\n\nAccording to them, it's my job to make dinner and my staying out late meant I didn't have dinner ready in a reasonable time. Since they were hungry, dinner wasn't ready, and they didn't know when dinner would be made, they were forced to order takeout. Because making dinner is my responsibility, I should pay for their takeout. My refusing to take responsibility and pay for their takeout makes me the AH.\n\nI don't think I am the AH because this was an extraordinary situation and we had food in the house they could have eaten. They chose to order $80+ in takeout for just themselves instead. Since they did not order any for me, it was not a shared expense and I don't feel I should have to pay for it.\n\nThey're still mad I won't pay for the takeout. They say I forced them to order it because I didn't make dinner by a reasonable time.\n\nADDED: There have been a lot of questions, see [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116mbvv/comment/j97imse/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for answers.", "created_utc": 1676836694, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116mbvv/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_the_takeout_i_forced/", "score": 274, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This kind of behavior is a red flag", "Answers to some of the questions and comments:\n\n**How things got this way:** I'm not sure. We were together for several years before the pandemic but we only moved in together during the lockdown. When we were both working from home, we split chores and cooking equally. My partner had to go back to the office about 6 months before I did. Once they started going back to the office, they asked me to make dinner since I was \"home all day\". Going back to the office was really stressful for them, so I wasn't fussed about it. Plus, I only have to go in three days a week so, on days I'm working from home, I have time after work to cook, pick up the place, etc. Somehow, it turned into cooking dinner is my job, even after I had to go back to the office. I don't mind, because I usually enjoy cooking. So, I do the cooking, the grocery shopping, and the kitchen cleanup. They generally text me when they leave the office so I can have dinner and a clean house waiting for them when they get home.\n\n**Has this happened before:** No\n\n**Questions about the takeout:** The takeout they ordered was sushi, which can be very expensive. I don't know why they didn't order for me also, as I love sushi, but I'm guessing it was because sushi is really expensive and maybe they assumed I would eat at work?\n\n**Why we're together:** We're together because we love each other and have a great time together. They're usually really empathetic, but I know work has been stressful for them as they work in accounting and it's tax season.\n\n**Why the 70-30 split on bills:** When we moved in together, I made slightly twice what they made. We agreed to split all shared spending proportionally.\n\n**Kids:** No, we do not have kids.\n\nFinally, I find it weird that everyone is assuming I am female and my partner is male. I kept this gender neutral for a reason, and I'm not going to change that. I will say that at least 50% of the assumptions on gender are wrong.", "NTA you sound more like roommates than partners. And even a roommate wouldn\u2019t pull an AH move like your partner did. If your relationship is otherwise fine, this is a weird hill for them to die on.

NTA obviously, but why are you allowing them to treat you like this?", "Nta and it is a red flag he is even making you question this. In no universe are you TA.", "NTA unless to yourself. Hey, if they being a grown ass adult and completely healthy can't prepare a simple meal, wash their clothes and do other simple tasks - send them back to mum's, they are defective...", "Wow, there are so many things wrong with this relationship.  Why are you solely responsible for making dinner?  Why does your partner lack all compassion for you having a bad day?  Why are they unable to feed themselves?  Are they physically handicapped?  Why aren't you asking any of these questions yourself?  \n\nFind yourself a partner who when they find out you almost lost your job and are having a really stressful day responds by making you a delicious meal to come home to and listens to your problems instead of *being* your problem.", "NTA. First of all, $80 in takeout is excessive in the extreme, so this was a petty revenge situation. Second of all, even if dinner is part of your household responsibilities, this was an extenuating circumstance and a good partner is flexible because life doesn't always fit our plans.

Expecting you to pay for $80 of takeout is ridiculous. They obviously don't care that your job remains and you kept them updated on the situation. It's not up to you to cook dinner or pay takeout if you're not home.\n\nIf they ordered food for you or even if there were leftovers not specifically ordered for you and you ate them when you got home I could see paying a portion.", "Nta ! I do not know how your partner acts on other subjects, but in this case, they are VERY \nEntitled and spoiled ! You were nearly laid off ! \nYou just got crap ton more work to do ! Late meeting ! She orders food on your dime !\nAnd I can guarantee \ud83d\udcaf % she made sure it would cost a bundle ! Would not bee surprised she threw away whatever was left so you would have none ! Terrible ! She is terrible !", "NTA your partner is behaving like a child. They are perfectly capable of cooking for themselves or paying for their own food. It's time to address your cooking split.", "NTA\n\nI would tell them to fuck off and from now on each of you are responsible for their own dinner.\n\nGood for refusing to pay, but I would be more angry of the audacity of this person. Are you their BF/GF or their servant who needs to be reminded of their place?", "Just hell to the no. NTA. This is NOT healthy. Just, reevaluate what you're doing here. I would just flat toss a partner spending that much on takeout ever much less because I was, you know, securing myself financially. Just NO.", "You lot are 32?! I scrolled back up expecting the age to be 18.\n\nNTA however", "NTA\n\nIt is time to reevaluate this situation and relationship.  Your partner is taking advantage of you, expecting you to cover 70% of bills, plus do all the cooking and cleaning up.  So what does your partner do?  \n\nYour partner could have made dinner.  They could have driven to get dinner.  They could have gotten something else less expensive for take out.  All sorts of options.  Instead, they decided to spend a lot of $ on take out and blame you.  Meanwhile, you communicated with them the issue.\n\nSo again, what do they bring to the relationship?\n\nIt is time for an adult discussion and a split of duties in the home.", "NTA.... This person you are with on the other hand.... BIG AH... you already subsidize their lifestyle and rather than being a considerate partner, they choose to ignore your emotionally draining, long day, cater to only their needs and hit you up for even MORE money....? WTF.... This person is a grown adult and is to mentally challenged to COOK for themselves, much less you??? \n\nHope they grow up.... someday.....", "NTA tune to have a meeting at home at redistribute chores. Make it equitable, discuss expectations and demands around dinner. Your partner is being entitled", "Nta. You need to make it very clear your life purpose is not to be their cook, cleaner, or pay for them to eat expensive take out when they decide they can't be bothered to care for themselves.", "NTA. It sounds like you already do too much for your partner. \n\nIf one of you works and the other doesn't, it might be reasonable for the one who does not work and is being supported to make dinner and clean up the house. But not only do you support your partner by paying 70% of bills, you are ALSO the one who does the cooking and cleaning? What does your partner bring to the table? What chores do they do for you?\n\nIf your cooking is an act of love, received as an act of love, then that's wonderful. But it doesn't sound like it is. It sounds like it's expected by someone who can't be bothered to do it themselves. And that's not great. \n\nThe splitshare thing is just disgusting, honestly, and probably spiteful. I hope you can see that your partner is using you, even if they don't mean to.", "NTA. The healthy situation would be the partner who is already at home asking the partner who is in the stressful work situation late in the evening what they would like to have after work and cooking/ordering something for them. To order only for oneself and not even checking if the working partner want some is very selfish. Expecting for them to pay for it \u2013 I don't even know what to say.\n\nThere is no thing as \"job\" at home. These are duties shared by all members of the household. Yes, often one partner does most of one thing, and other - most of another. But it's not a slavery. If my husband likes cooking and usually is the one doing it, it doesn't mean he is supposed to cook for me 24/7 whenever I want to eat. Adult person who is hungry is supposed to take care of their own needs.", "You specifically stated that you'd make dinner when you got home & suggested a snack to tide them over. Ordering takeout was entirely a personal choice AND given that it was entirely their meal on top of that....it is NOT a shared expense and one they need to cover on their own.  NTA, but they certainly are in this instance.", "OP?   I could care less what \"gender\" relationship you are in.   Bottom line is this is just wrong in any relationship.   Clearly your S/O is an asshole and you need to speak up for yourself.\n\nI've had bad days at work like you've described.   And even though I do the cooking at home, my S/O knows when to step up and pick up those pieces when I am just shattered.   He would never NOT do this to take care of me after \"a day\".   Please take a long hard look at this relationship you have.   If they do this now, they'll never take care of you....it's all $$ and them.     HUGS!", "When I was 10 years old I would occasionally make dinner for my family and myself when my parents had to work late. I obviously never made anything very special at that age, mostly boxed mac and cheese and frozen vegetables. However, the sense of relief my parents had when they would get home at 8pm and didn\u2019t have to cook was immense. The point is that it is so simple and easy to make a very basic dinner that it shocks me that the OP would even think they are wrong in this situation.", "NTA. Seriously who would do that? Your partner wasn\u2019t forced. They decided not to make themselves dinner or just eat some cereals and order take out. You\u2019re not responsible. They\u2019re insane. And a baby.", "What do you get out of this relationship?", "NTA. Your partner is a real f-info asshole.", "NTA \nbut tbh I\u2019m annoyed at you for still offering to cook when you got home. It gives them a leg to stand on as regards ordering instead of making something - by the time they realised you wouldn\u2019t be home MAYBE they could argue they were too tired to bother starting to cook. In your place I\u2019d have said, \u2018I\u2019ve had a horrible day and I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be stuck here. You\u2019ll have to sort yourself out\u2019 at the very least. \n\nNevertheless they are still the asshole. After the day you had they should\u2019ve been offering to cook/order take out for you. Maintaining that it\u2019s someone else\u2019s job in extreme circumstances is not how a partnership should work. \n\nMoreover the fact that they didn\u2019t ask you before ordering nor asked if you wanted anything proves that they knew they were out of line or were being passive aggressive or both. \n\nI think your partner has gotten way complacent and needs a serious reality check. From your comment I think you also need to take a hard look at where you\u2019re at and how you got there and if it\u2019s where you want to be.\n\nSorry if this sounds self righteous. It\u2019s easy to make it sound easy from the outside I know. I\u2019m sorry for your horrible day and that you\u2019re fighting with your partner on top of that \u2764\ufe0f", "Your partner's behavior is extremely childish and you should take it as a red flag. It sounds like you're doing WAY more than your share of housework and at the very least that ought be revisited and renegotiated. \n\nNTA", "Starving people would make a sandwich. Entitled brats would find the time to not only or something but something even out of their own price range that they can\u2019t even afford and expect someone else to foot the bill.

An adult is fully capable of feeding themselves and paying for it. Good grief.", "Absolutely NTA - is your partner a toddler???? They are responsible for feeding themselves", "A good partner would have ordered your favorite takeout and had it waiting for you when you got home. Plus wine/beer/dessert and a back rub. \n\nNTA. Don\u2019t put up with that sh*t!", "NTA, your \"adult\" partner is an asshole and if they're gonna keep with that immature and childish behaviour, you should kick them out.", "You're the guy aren't you.", "Sounds like something a shitty girlfriend would do. Expect you to pay.", "I think my genitals would shrivel into my body if this was my partner.\n\n**Pathetic**: refuses to make their own meal as a one off in an emergency.\n\n**Lazy**: can't manage to make a cheese sandwich or beans on toast, or whatever easy meal they like.\n\n**Selfish**: no consideration whatsoever for the difficult day the OP just had.\n\n**Penny-pinching**: demanding money for a takeaway.\n\n**Confrontational**: decided that takeaway money was worth getting into a fight over.\n\nIs he or she worth it, OP?", "I did pick up on the gender neutrality in your post. As others have pointed out, you are describing a situation that is unequal, and in a way that resembles antique gender roles. These have also resulted in many previous AITA's where the female was being forced into such a situation. So I feel that's what led to the assumption (it was also what I pictured in my mind).\n\nHave you realized they were already assuming it would come 100% out of your pockets when they chose to spend a fortune on the delivery for just themselves? I can't think of a more concise summary of the problem with this relationship. \nDon't brush aside that this happened.", "The gender of your partner seems to be \"useless\", don't worry, we get it", "All of this makes it sound even worse. All I can think of is indentured servitude. You are both being AH to you. Your partner for everything you've described, and you for putting up with it.", ">I will say that at least 50% of the assumptions on gender are wrong.\n\nThat's silly. You do know that in a lot of relationships, women are treated this way? If not, how lucky. So, it's not weird. Though, I have seen it in same sex couples as well, where there's a purposefully created power imbalance.", "Uhh.. so you're OK with paying *70%* of the bills while being expected to cook and clean?? \nOdd.", "From your post it sounds like your partner doesn't even like you or care about you in the slightest, let alone love you. They also sound like an awful person. \n\nI was in a long term relationship once upon a time and the shared history and years of being convinced we loved each other and my partner was amazing blinded me to the fact that eventually, that actually was not the case.\n\nI'm thinking you're failing to see the present reality tbh.", "INFO: what is ur currency...I had sushi and a small sake for lunch and it cost me 11usd$ not including tip...

Your partner didn\u2019t just have a temper tantrum, they were spiteful. Sure you\u2019re in love, whatever. But you need them to reevaluate how they treat you. Or this relationship will sink and take you down with it. NTA", "YUP, unbelievable.", "Exactly. Useless, selfish and unkind behavior to put it mildly. I can\u2019t imagine ordering food and not getting anything for my partner who had a very tough day.\n\nNTA", "Dinner is usually more expensive. A la carte is even more expensive. I like certain things more than others. Salmon, tuna, etc. , are generic and meh. I love scallops, yellowtail jalape\u00f1o, sweet shrimp and each piece is $4-$10 depending on where I\u2019m at (NYC area). Easy to rack up $80 if I\u2019m in the mood to be bougie. My friend and I racked up over $200 one night.", "NYC that explains it I'm on the coast of FL.  NGL I had a small heart attack over her dinner bill just for herself."]}
