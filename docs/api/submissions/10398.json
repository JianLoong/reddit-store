{"id": 10398, "submission_id": "116mbvv", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for the takeout I \"forced\" my partner to order?", "selftext": "\"Forced\" is their words, not mine.\n\nI saw another AITA about cooking and it made me think of my situation from a couple weeks back. I don't think I was being the AH, but my partner is still mad about it. Posting from a throwaway account as mutual friends are on Reddit.\n\nLast month my (32) company announced that we would be laying people off. I was in the office that day and it was awful. Person after person was brought into HR, told they were being separated, and escorted out of the office. After they were done, they called a second meeting and told those of us left that the layoffs were over. A lot of the people I work with were let go. I texted my partner (32) after both announcements. Once to tell them about the layoffs and then to tell them I was \"safe\". In the second text I also told them I would not be home until late. My team had decided to stay late and figure out how to redistribute the work so that our projects wouldn't fail. We sat in a conference room and worked through all the projects and didn't leave until almost 9pm. Starting at about 8, my partner began texting me asking when I was getting home, what was for dinner, and that they were hungry. I kept replying that I didn't know when I would get to leave, that I would make dinner when I got home, and that if they were hungry they could make dinner or have a snack and wait.\n\nI didn't get home until almost 10 and found empty takeout containers in the kitchen. I asked if they had ordered takeout (they had), if they had ordered me any (they had not) and if they were still hungry (they were not). It was late and I was emotionally exhausted so I didn't eat and went straight to bed.\n\nThe next weekend, I found a Splitwise for their meal allocated 100% to me. Since we moved in together, we put all shared expenses like rent, bills, groceries, and takeout in Splitwise with a 70-30 split. Individual expenses, like if one of us buys lunch at work, do not go in Splitwise. I thought it was a mistake, so I deleted it. The next day they got mad at me for not paying for their takeout.\n\nAccording to them, it's my job to make dinner and my staying out late meant I didn't have dinner ready in a reasonable time. Since they were hungry, dinner wasn't ready, and they didn't know when dinner would be made, they were forced to order takeout. Because making dinner is my responsibility, I should pay for their takeout. My refusing to take responsibility and pay for their takeout makes me the AH.\n\nI don't think I am the AH because this was an extraordinary situation and we had food in the house they could have eaten. They chose to order $80+ in takeout for just themselves instead. Since they did not order any for me, it was not a shared expense and I don't feel I should have to pay for it.\n\nThey're still mad I won't pay for the takeout. They say I forced them to order it because I didn't make dinner by a reasonable time.\n\nADDED: There have been a lot of questions, see [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116mbvv/comment/j97imse/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for answers.", "created_utc": 1676836694, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116mbvv/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_the_takeout_i_forced/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s pretty clear they were angry and are choosing to be passive aggressive by ordering food (but none for you) and then trying to get you to pay for it. \n\nOP, run. This kind of behavior is a red flag", "Answers to some of the questions and comments:\n\n**How things got this way:** I'm not sure. We were together for several years before the pandemic but we only moved in together during the lockdown. When we were both working from home, we split chores and cooking equally. My partner had to go back to the office about 6 months before I did. Once they started going back to the office, they asked me to make dinner since I was \"home all day\". Going back to the office was really stressful for them, so I wasn't fussed about it. Plus, I only have to go in three days a week so, on days I'm working from home, I have time after work to cook, pick up the place, etc. Somehow, it turned into cooking dinner is my job, even after I had to go back to the office. I don't mind, because I usually enjoy cooking. So, I do the cooking, the grocery shopping, and the kitchen cleanup. They generally text me when they leave the office so I can have dinner and a clean house waiting for them when they get home.\n\n**Has this happened before:** No\n\n**Questions about the takeout:** The takeout they ordered was sushi, which can be very expensive. I don't know why they didn't order for me also, as I love sushi, but I'm guessing it was because sushi is really expensive and maybe they assumed I would eat at work?\n\n**Why we're together:** We're together because we love each other and have a great time together. They're usually really empathetic, but I know work has been stressful for them as they work in accounting and it's tax season.\n\n**Why the 70-30 split on bills:** When we moved in together, I made slightly twice what they made. We agreed to split all shared spending proportionally.\n\n**Kids:** No, we do not have kids.\n\nFinally, I find it weird that everyone is assuming I am female and my partner is male. I kept this gender neutral for a reason, and I'm not going to change that. I will say that at least 50% of the assumptions on gender are wrong.", "NTA you sound more like roommates than partners. And even a roommate wouldn\u2019t pull an AH move like your partner did. If your relationship is otherwise fine, this is a weird hill for them to die on. If it\u2019s not, it seems like resentment and spite are behind their behaviour. NTA obviously, but why are you allowing them to treat you like this?", "Nta and it is a red flag he is even making you question this. In no universe are you TA.", "NTA unless to yourself. Hey, if they being a grown ass adult and completely healthy can't prepare a simple meal, wash their clothes and do other simple tasks - send them back to mum's, they are defective...", "Wow, there are so many things wrong with this relationship.  Why are you solely responsible for making dinner?  Why does your partner lack all compassion for you having a bad day?  Why are they unable to feed themselves?  Are they physically handicapped?  Why aren't you asking any of these questions yourself?  \n\nFind yourself a partner who when they find out you almost lost your job and are having a really stressful day responds by making you a delicious meal to come home to and listens to your problems instead of *being* your problem.", "NTA. First of all, $80 in takeout is excessive in the extreme, so this was a petty revenge situation. Second of all, even if dinner is part of your household responsibilities, this was an extenuating circumstance and a good partner is flexible because life doesn't always fit our plans. Third, have you even agreed that dinner is indeed your sole responsibility? \n\nFinally, unless you're in management, don't stay at work until 9pm to solve problems management has made.", "NTA, I'm assuming you're dating a grown adult. Why can't they be responsible for their own meal if you aren't cooking?", "NTA, there was food in the house and presumably your partner is able to use their hands and feed themselves once in a while", "NTA, the fact that they can't cook themselfes is their problem. they are free ofc of not cooking and to order always the take out but you haven't pay for them", "NTA. they couldn\u2019t cook for themselves just this once? and the fact that they didn\u2019t even order anything for you knowing you were working till late and hadn\u2019t eaten either\u2026 pretty selfish imo. and then the audacity to ask you to pay for their meal lol wow", "NTA. They bought food for themselves, didn't buy you any and expected you to pay for it?\n\nLol, the entitlement.\n\nIs this a one off?", "NTA!", "NTA - your \"partner\" doesn't sound much like a partner. They sound like a petulant child.", "NTA why would it be your job to cook dinner if someone else is home?", "NTA. Your partner is an adult, not an infant. He should be able to make himself a dinner.

Yikes", "NTA, dump this loser now. \n\nCounter example: this summer I participated in a group rec league sport two nights a week. Even though I usually do the cooking, he made or ordered dinner each of those nights for himself and our kid AND always set aside a plate for me because he knew I'd be starving when I got home.
