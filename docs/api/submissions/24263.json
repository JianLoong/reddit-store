He\u2019s a hobby photographer and likes to take portraits of women, therefore we did some little photoshoots which at some point also involved me undressing. At the time I really didn\u2019t think anything of it, we were both having fun and the pictures turned out well. \n\nShortly after, i realised that he kept some of his previous gf\u2019s explicit pictures on his laptop. I didn\u2019t specifically look at them, I saw him scrolling through his gallery at some point and as far as I could tell she was either n*de or wearing lingerie in some of them. Immediately I thought that was weird, especially since their split wasn\u2019t exactly amicable. I asked him why he would keep pictures like that and he told me that it was \u201ca nice memory\u201d for him, which made me pretty uncomfortable but I decided to drop it. He promised he would \u201cnever do anything\u201d with those pics. \n\nA couple of months later he mentioned that one of his hard drives broke and that he had therefore lost many explicit pics/videos of several of his ex gfs (as far as I know about 5-6 women). That made me feel incredibly uncomfortable, why would you back things like that up on a hard drive anyway? To me it felt like he was collecting explicit material like Pok\u00e9mon cards for over a decade and that creeped me out tbh.\n\nFast forward a few months, we realised that things weren\u2019t working out for us. We had a huge fight and agreed that we should probably break up. I remembered our conversations about explicit photos of ex partners and didn\u2019t want to end up in his \u201ccollection\u201d. To me it\u2019s universally understood that you delete explicit pics/vids of your ex after a breakup and I had previously communicated that to him. However, I knew that he had no intentions of deleting them. After all, why would he delete mine if he wouldn\u2019t delete the other girls\u2019 pics?\n\nSo I took it upon myself to sneak into his phone/cloud and delete my explicit pictures. Then I thought about his ex and how uncomfortable I would feel if I was her and he had kept my private pictures. Hers were only a few clicks away and I decided to just delete the 2 folders that contained hers.\n\nNaturally he found out and got incredibly mad at me. He said it wasn\u2019t my place to delete any of his data - especially not the other girls\u2019 pictures - and that I betrayed his trust in the worst way. Apparently his friends agreed with him and told him he should dump me because of it.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t regret it and I would do it again. If another woman found my explicit pictures on my ex bf\u2019s phone/computer and deleted them, I\u2019d be thankful. I believe a man who possesses a woman\u2019s n*des is inherently in a certain position of power that he could abuse at any time. And even if he doesn\u2019t, what if someone stumbles across those pictures accidentally or he gets hacked?

He didn\u2019t have the right to keep those photos", "Nta", "NTA. Well done for protecting yourself from someone who sounds not very nice.", "I'd say you're probably NTA, but **I don't think it's a straight forward, anybody can delete their partner's exs' nudes.**\n\nI don't blame you for deleting your pictures you wanted to protect yourself. You wanted to protect the other girls but don't know the details of those relationships. Mybe one of them died/mentally deteriorated and he didn't tell you. Maybe his relationship with them was different and they were comfortable with him keeping the photos. Maybe he didn't trust them not to leak his nudes and he felt he should keep theirs as collateral. Maybe they were abusive to him and his way of feeling better about the situation was to keep the nudes.\n\nOn the other hand, he left these pictures unsecured for his partner to access, a hacker or thief might also have been able to get hold of them, quite possibly his next partner would get access to them as well, one who might be jealous and might leak them to embarrass the others.\n\nIt's a hard question. Personally I think if people were truly honest, I'd be fine with them keeping their ex's nudes if they properly protected them. After all, not everybody has a good memory, some people will gradually forget what their old partner looked like and how attracted to them they were. But he wasn't protecting those pictures, and most people are neither truly honest nor capable of adequately protecting their files.

All the red flags were there and you chose to ignore them instead of addressing them head on by having the hard conversations. You knew about the photos he had and he never hid them from you. You mention numerous times how you \u201cdidn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d and that\u2019s on you for not setting boundaries. The whole \u201cuniversally understood\u201d concept of deleting stuff is just an assumption and if you don\u2019t want that data all you have to do is ask for it to be deleted and if you don\u2019t trust him then get him to do it infront of you. The fact that you \u201ctook it upon yourself\u201d is a complete AH maneuver. You never gave him the chance to delete it cause if he didn\u2019t then it would completely put you on the right side of the situation. You also had no right to delete any of his other data.

But I say YTA for deleting the other pictures, although I don't think that makes you the worst person (since they are explicit pictures, but that's just my opinion). \n\nMaybe that's controversial. Also maybe his intentions are bad, but I'm not in the place to determine that. Although what you say about the girl not wanting them....maybe you're just right OP, but it is a judgement thing; I'd say.", "Depends, what if those women had made it clear they weren't deleting his nudes and he wanted to do the same? What if despite the difficult breakup, the ex had said that he could keep them (its not unbelievable that somebody might enjoy the thought of their ex keeping a naked photo of them).  \nBut then again he let a third party get access to those pictures and put the other girls at risk.", "However op did break the law, Computer misuse act, unauthorised access to computer material and unauthorised modification of computer material. Not saying it wasn't justified but her bf can take legal action.", ">  He has no right to keep them\n\nSo, moral arguments aside for a moment - actually, in some countries he is by default legally the image copyright holder and could very likely keep them (subject to any other agreement signed at the time). Just pointing that out, and not saying I agree that he should be able to keep them in any way.", "I agree that he shouldn't have let his girlfriend have access to someone else's intimidate photos, but I don't think he was necessarily wrong for keeping them.\n\nMaybe some of his ex partners made it clear they would keep his nudes so he did the same. Maybe some of them were actually comfortable with him keeping the photos (some people are turned on by the idea that years from now, an ex still fantasises about them).\n\nOr maybe none of that is true and he kept their photos against their wishes. I have no idea.", "Thank you for your comment. To provide some info: I know for a fact none of his exes have died or are unwell, over the course of the relationship he has shown me pretty much all of their social media profiles.\n\nI know for a fact that the ex whose photos I deleted was not comfortable with him keeping any nudes of her, because he mentioned during multiple conversations that she was very particular about him giving her back/getting rid of everything that was used sexually during their relationship. I don't know about the other girls, but their pics/vids were only on his hard drive which broke long before this incident occurred.\n\nI did ask him why he wanted to keep them and he repeatedly replied that it was just for memory purposes but that he wasn't looking at them and wouldn't ever do anything with them. I do not know if anybody was threatening/blackmailing him. He didn't mention anything like that and I honestly didn't ask.\n\nAlso, personally I believe that you don't need nudes to remember what your ex looks like. He has plenty of photos of his former girlfriends (fully clothed) and I didn't mind. He even had some up on his website and I supported that decision (I told him the photos were beautiful and as long as his ex is okay with him keeping them up, I would be too)", "They were not published anywhere, if that\u2019s what you mean. So I would say they were for personal use. As far as I know nobody signed any contract or anything like that (I sure didn\u2019t and even during the shoot I told him - at that time in kind of a joking way - that I expected him to delete these pics if we ever broke up)", "This feels like victim blaming. Sharing nude or risque photos is a fun, sexy couples activity. Do you want nobody to ever engage in that out of fear of leaks?", "I was thinking that, he might have had no bad intentions by keeping them. But at the same time, he put the others at risk by allowing his ex to have access to those images. If she'd been a jealous partner she could have leaked them.", "How?", "...and if he refused?", "What's your rationale for this?", "So you're saying you're a professional photographer and regularly jerk off to the pictures you take? I feel sick reading this...", "Thank you for your judgment. Due to the character limit, there was a lot of info that I couldn't put in the post and I would like to add it here because I think you misunderstood some of the things I said.\n\nI did address it. Several times. Until the hard drive crashed, I only knew about one of his exe's nudes (the most recent one) and he would always have an excuse why he wouldn't delete them. He would say things like \"oh, I forget those were there\" and when I mentioned it again he said \"I can't delete them, because I can't bear to look at them\". I told him straight up that I didn't think what he was doing was right and that I believe all sexually explicit content should be deleted after a relationship ends. At the same time, I didn't want to argue about something like that every single day. He would also get mad at me and tell me that it's none of my business and that I should drop it. He made me feel stupid for mentioning it, so I stopped. \n\nAlso I did ask him to delete them. Me deleting the nudes occurred back in Mai this year. Afterwards we were on and off again and during one of the off periods I explicitly told him to delete all sexually explicit pictures of me (thinking I might have not deleted everything and there might still be some left). He never responded to that.\n\nI know it's a messy situation and I hope this clears some things up.", "Ok great. Now that we\u2019ve confirmed that, call the cops. Submit a report. Go ahead, since this is a point you obviously wanted to share.", "I googled and you are correct. I don\u2019t like it at all, but not sure why you are downvoted for pointing out a legal fact.", "No, because they had a verbal agreement the photos would be deleted if they broke up", "It's not victim blaming its living with the consequences of your actions. How many times have women on here said that if you don't want kids then don't have sex because BC can fail. If you don't want someone to have nudes of you then do not give them nudes.", "> This feels like victim blaming. \n\nWho is the victim?  Did he take nude photos of her without her permission?  If you want to retain ownership of nude images of your body, then sign a contract before you let someone photograph you nude.", "It's not her data, period.", "Thank you. People read and react but forget to check that they actually understood what they read, or sometimes act as if the upvote and downvote buttons are for registering their emotions with the world! :-)", "> No, because they had a verbal agreement the photos would be deleted if they broke up\n\nSometimes wishful thinking works in courts, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it.  Where did you see any mention of a verbal agreement?", "A verbal agreement is hard to prove without a recording or witnesses. If that couldn't be proven (assuming this went to court, and the dude doesn't sound like the type to be honest about this) then copyright law would probably take precedence. Though I am just an ex-pro photographer, not a lawyer.", "What about the pictures of her?", "That would depend on country. In mine, if you have pics of someone without a signed contract, the pics and data belong to the human subject of the photos, not the photographer. \nBut regardless legality does not equate to morality.", "She says that\u2019s the condition under which she took the photos - but it\u2019s all hypothetical, right? I mean if he sued her for deleting nudes of herself and another ex under copyright law, he might win but would look like a MASSIVE ASSHOLE and his habit of keeping exs nudes would be public knowledge and good luck getting a gf to pose again. \n\nSo not only is she morally NTA, I think she did the same thing as well. The most that could happen is a judge fine her and he get blasted all over social media. It\u2019s not like the judge will order her to provide him with more nudes \ud83d\ude02", ">To me it\u2019s universally understood that you delete explicit pics/vids of your ex after a breakup and I had previously communicated that to him.\n\nIt is clear that she gave those to him with the expectation that they would be deleted at the end of the relationship.", "Even if OP and him had a verbal agreement, there is no way to know about any agreements relating to the pictures she deleted of the ex. As you said, those pictures may very well have been his legal property.", "No, I do think you are probably right. I googled it and lawyers were saying \u201ceven if you send nudes, NEVER let bf TAKE them because then he has copyright\u201dBut as you pointed out in your first post, he probably won\u2019t take her to court. Because he\u2019d look like a total dick, and his dirty little habit would be public knowledge and ruin his chances of tricking more girls into adding to his nakey collection. That\u2019s why he\u2019s so mad - he can\u2019t DO anything, practically, so he\u2019s furious. In the end, she probably did the smartest thing", "It's not her data, period. \n\nShe can legally take action if he distributes the photo in any way.", "I agree totally. And she did those other girls a favour."]}
