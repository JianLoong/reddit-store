Your husband shouldn't be thinking of throwing out things that belong to you - no matter what percentage of the bills either of you pay - especially without talking to you or getting your permission.

I literally own my very own mini library and it's still gets added to to this day. So I would also do what you have done if someone eve made the slightest comment about harming my books. \n\nSo, NTA for being protective of your books but I would also sit down and have a heart to heart conversation with your husband about why he's so against your romance books. I can honestly think of much worse books to keep around than just some romance books that take up what? 1 book shelf?

He should probably considered some internal reflection as to why you reading romance novels bothers his so deeply.", "NTA. My late husband did this with my books - college books, scary books, literature, non-fiction. He also tried to move them into a non-insulated garden shed, which would have destroyed them. I didn't let him and neither should you. The thing with guilt-tripping is, it can only work if you gaf. I learned to not gaf about my husband being weirdly jealous of my books. And he learned that no matter how hard or often he tried pressing that button,  it just didn't connect to anything.  Lol", "You\u2019re married to a real dickbag", "NTA. They're books. Why on earth is this man threatened by books?\n\nThrowing away your possessions without your consent would be an AH move.", "NTA\nBased on your comments, it sounds like he has a problem with your books because they are important to you. If it was about the space  they take, the ones on your iPad wouldn't bother him, and a storage compromise would be ok. You could move your bookshelf, put the books in a box in your closet or under the bed, or use it as a coffee or side table. When I lived in a small apartment, I used a trunk as a side table to save space and have storage. \n\nI'd lock my iPad and make him use his own, or your files might \"accidentally\" be deleted.", "If you read romance, then you know exactly what trope your husband falls into right now: the insecure, controlling partner the FMC breaks up with in the 1st third of the novel.\n\nHonestly, it's either being controlling, or misogyny (ie: \"romance isn't real literature\"/\"chic lit is trash\"). I'm not going to even debate the merits of that stance but let's just say that as a social science major with a minor concentration in literature, I have *opinions* on how trash that take is. \n\nYour husband has a problem with a harmless, potentially enhancing and enjoyable hobby. Unless you're reading the household into bankruptcy, shirking your share of household responsibilities or endangering yourself reading while crossing the road or something...what exactly would cause him to feel threatened by books? Does he feel like he can't match up to your MMCs? Because that's sad. \n\nOh, and let's remember that his reaction to whatever his deal with romance novels is, was hurt YOU by destroying or dumping something you hold dear. If you wanted a barometer of how much your feelings or opinions matter to him, I'd say that's a pretty good indication. He was definitely on the hunt to grab and dump the books when he was \"testing\" the cabinets. \n\nUnless he has a really good explanation for why he's acting like such a stunted eggplant, I would consider keeping the books and trashing the controlling husband. \n\nAfter all, it's sad that romance fiction will give you better men as partners than your actual partner. In a world where Avery Keelan gave us Chase Carter and Elle Kennedy gave us Garret Graham, let's hold the *real* men more accountable.", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t be throwing out your belongings \u2014 he\u2019s being an asshole.", "NTA. This is really annoying. My parents police what I read too lol. Do you have any recs?! LOL.

That deserves life without parole.", "NTA. How is allowing him to throw away your novels demonstrating caring? There is something very wrong with his attitude toward you and your books. You should probably explore this a bit more with him, but make it clear he doesn't get to throw your books away.", "Ok, it sounds like the problem is that you DO trust him. He said that he wants to throw out your books, and you believe him. He knows that you enjoy these books, and for some unclear reason he wants to take them away from you. I almost never go down that Reddit, anything I don\u2019t like must be abuse road. But this really does sound kind of abusive.

Nothing wrong with have a hobby and reading is probably one of the most common ones. Your husband sounds really insecure about his own ability to provide romance and seems to think removing the books will solve the problem. I wouldnt relent and give him access.", "Your husband is defective, return him.", "NTA, your husband sounds like a controlling AH who doesn't respect your things and refuses to communicate his needs/wants. Tell him to use his big boy words instead of playing games like this.", "NTA. Armchair psychology-ing here. He sounds threatened, insecure, and self conscious. I'm going to assume that if you try to have a real conversation  about why they bother him so much, he'll either lie, get defensive and mad about it, and or he doesn't even realize why he's so annoyed by them. It seems he's threatened by you enjoying the thought of romance that he can't provide, or something like that. Or he's being misogynistic, \"stupid ass useless pointless vapid woman novel\", which is also likely hiding insecurity.\n\n\nAs with all communication, approach softly and plead with him to be soft with you as well and open up about why he doesn't like them.", "NTA. As a romance author, I want to lock your husband in a cabinet and push it down a hill. But I can't, so he's going into a book.\n\n\nSide note: anyone who starts purposely throwing away things you enjoy, destroying them, or putting you down over them isn't a great person to be with. I have stacks and stacks of books. Both ones I've written and from fellow authors. Not once has my husband mentioned doing anything to them besides finding another bookshelf. While my ex-husband burnt all of my original manuscripts before I ever had the chance to publish. Watch that cabinet closely because I guarantee he's going to find a way in.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband hates reading. \n\nHe\u2019s only mad that you locked them up because it took away the option of throwing them away against your will because he knows they\u2019re important to you.\n\nMy husband built me shelves for my books because he wanted me to have the space to have a collection of things that give me joy. Why isn\u2019t your husband celebrating that you have a hobby you enjoy?\n\nBtw - if you like romance novels, have you tried fanfiction yet?

I\u2019m not saying for you to divorce your husband or anything but wow HOW DARE HE? Wtf? Why all the hatred?\n\nThe whole book thing aside, the fact that your husband wants to trash items that belong TO YOU, no matter what percentage of the bills you pay, is a huge red flag. Also, WHY DID HE TRY TO OPEN ONE OF THEM???? Wow. He was actively trespassing your \u201cproperty\u201d by doing so and if he was able to open it who knows what would have happened (your books would probably be gone by now) which is, again, a huge red flag. Jesus.\n\nNTA but your husband is weird as hell.\n\nEDIT: changed a few things but same context.", "Info: why does he say your romance books get \"in the way\"? Has he been able to pinpoint any tangible negative impact your relationship has had bc of said books?\nHow is he as a partner?", "NTA. He sounds very immature.", "Double down. Start reading MM and BL manhwa too.", "NTA. You have a husband problem.  \n\n\nHe shouldn't be threatening to throw away ANYTHING of yours, especially something you clearly care about. The fact that he tried to get into the cabinet, as if he was going to follow through with that threat, tells you a lot about him and his motivations. He doesn't care if it's something completely harmless that makes you happy, he doesn't like it and it isn't important to HIM so he wants to throw it out. Hell, maybe he feels like he needs to get rid of them because the romances in those books are more fulfilling to you than whatever he's got to offer and he wants to eliminate the competition.  \n\n\nWhatever the reason, it is NOT OKAY for him to threaten and try to destroy your stuff, and for him to try to turn that around on you and claim trust issues and guilt tripping? No. It's time to have a 'come to jesus' talk with him about boundaries and that things that are important to you are \\*not something he gets to mess with\\*, and if he can't handle a few books existing in the same space as him, that's a HIM problem and he needs to get over it. They're not in the way, they have their own spot and he still wants to get rid of them. Ask him what his REAL problem is with the books and why you have to put up with anything he likes that you don't particularly care for, but the one thing you like that he doesn't care for very much is such a big deal and needs to get thrown out right away.  \n\n\nHonestly? If I had a partner that started threatening or destroying things that were important to me just because they didn't matter to them - I grew up in foster care and losing things I cared about all the time made me lose joy in a lot of things and stop caring about anything, because I could always lose it so easily. I even have trouble feeling strongly about people, pets, anything that was important to me in my life suddenly being gone - however it happens - because basically once something is no longer in my immediate reach, as far as my brain is concerned, it's gone forever and doesn't matter anymore and I'm incapable of feeling much about it.  \n\n\nIt's something I'm still working on and trying to heal from.

Nobody gets to threaten throwing your property away but I would've gone about it a different way. You believe he will throw out your books because the threated too. At which you act defensively, by choosing to lock them up and throw away the key, instead of communicating with your husband about his wants and needs. You should have a serious heart to heart with your Husband about why he's upset and irritated with the books, maybe he feels neglected or unappreciated or feels like you are paying more attention to the books than to him.

I don't see why he would even want to throw away something that you love and makes you happy.", "You are in an abusive relationship.  This is not normal behavior for any husband.  NTA.", "NTA. OP, you\u2019ve stated several relevant points in comments. \n\n1. You moved from a 2bed apt to a studio for his dream job.\n\n2.  He physically moves your small bookcase out of frustration. \n\n3. He complains about your ebooks on your iPad for storage reasons, when he has his own iPad and prefers yours. \n\nYou need to confront your husband about what his -actual- issue is. It sounds like he feels entitled to control your possessions, the space they take, and potentially the space that you take up in the apartment. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if you come home one day and he\u2019s completely gotten rid of the safe with your books inside.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like some sort of insecurity has developed for him involving your romance novels. Said insecurity could take one of two forms:\n1. Like others have suggested, he feels like his needs aren\u2019t getting met or he has to become a person he\u2019s not to please you, much like a woman in a relationship with a porn addicted man. Based on your comments it sounds like this isn\u2019t the case, though he may have still internalized some of this kind of insecurity without you knowing.\n2. He knows or feels like he\u2019s an insufficient partner and wants to prevent you from seeing all the areas in which he\u2019s lacking. If you read romance, you might raise your standards and realize he\u2019s not all that great. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you to figure out which of the two is actually happening or if there\u2019s a mix of both. Have a thorough, healthy, calm conversation with him and consider therapy if needed. Do not let him get rid of your books or otherwise force you into anything. Do come to a sound agreement between the two of you for how to resolve the issue and either move past it or move on.\n\nAlso to note, either of these options could have been brought about recently by a conversation he had with someone, a tv show, a passing comment, anything. Try to figure out the cause for the sudden dislike of your books.\n\nBest of luck! I\u2019m sorry this is challenging", "Nta", "NTA\n\nYour husband is for wanting to throw away your stuff.

Then turns around and questions you for taking necessary precautions in protecting your belongings and tries to make you out to be the bad one who doesn't trust her husband. When he instilled the mistrust the minute, he mentioned throwing them away. Of course you don't trust him, I wouldn't. \n\nAnd to be honest, you shouldn't have to lock up your belongings in your home, especially not from your husband. He doesn't respect your belongings or your interest in reading and sees them as something that's \"in the way.\" He knows you, and im sure you've been an avid reader for years; why tf would he use the words \"in the way\" to describe what's important to you?\n\nAnd I read in your replies that yall downsized for his dream job...you can do that for him, but he can't put up with a fucking bookcase with some romance novels?

I'm also a romance enthusiast and I also primarily own them digitally but I do have some physical copies, especially of manga. My husband teases me sometimes about my \"smut\" and we've had conversations about me trimming down my overall book collection as it is a bit out of hand. But the way your husband is acting, he's clearly insecure about what you're reading and trying to find a way to get rid of it. I'd say if he's that concerned that the romance you're reading is better than what he offers, that doesn't mean you have to give up a hobby you enjoy - but he probably needs to either step up as a romantic partner or work on his insecurities or both.", "Nta.

I think there's another reason he wants to throw them out.", "If the issue is space, why isn't he suggesting getting rid of any of his hobby things that are \"in the way\"? Because this is about control. How's his social media usage lately? The only time I hear any complaints about romance books is by the misogynistic Podcasters. \n\nI recommend mirroring his energy about his stuff. Say it's \"in the way\" and get pushy about getting rid of his stuff. Tell him until he's willing to actually talk about this, you're going to keep treating him the way he's treating you. Back his ass into a corner.", "NTA: He's presenting like he's threatened by imaginary men, and he's acting insecure and controlling. He's actively trying to deprive you of joy. He's not acting trustworthy, and all his talk has me wondering what kind of media he's consuming.\n\n\nBy the time he's gotten to \"You're choosing those books over me!\" he's got an entire storyline in his head where he's the hero, you're a villain, and the books are somehow in the way of your redemption arc. There's resentment under the surface of this.\n\n\nThere's a lot going on he's not telling you yet about the ways he's thinking about this. \"In the way\" of what? When he finally gets to talking, it's likely going to be some laundry list of complaints that he's been sitting on. Ways he thinks things should be different, and could be, too, if it weren't for those meddling books. And other things.\n\n\nI don't envy you the process of finding out just what sort of issues are under there.", "NTA but there is something deeper here. I am wondering if he is jealous or feeling inadequate because you read them. Perhaps a conversation with him about it, ask him specifically why it bothers him.

I am not saying you are, just that he might be thinking that. A good discussion might help him.", "Has he always been jealous & disapproving of things that are important to you?

He then misrepresents your reaction to his threats and acts like you are the problem. \n\nThis is actually a pretty serious indication that he may be emotionally abusive.  It is incredibly difficult to diagnose an emotionally abusive relationship while you are in it. \n\nHow does your husband normally react to not getting his way?  \nDoes he often treat your interests as less than?  \nHow does he respond when you raise a grievance or tell him you have a need that's not met? Does he try to convince you you're wrong to feel that way?  Is his defensive reaction such a hassle that you've stopped voicing what you feel/need because you know it won't do any good to bring it up?\nDoes he often try to tell you what you \"should\" like, think, or feel?  Or try to make you do things the way he thinks is best (when it doesn't really affect him)?  \nDoes he often act as if you having your own way/needs/opinions means that you \"must not really love him\", \"you always take things the wrong way\", or that now he \"Will never joke around with you again/talk to you again\" etc?\n\nIf any of these ring a bell, please read this free book to see if you recognize any of the manipulations or tactics and see if there is a pattern. Even if he isn't emotionally abusive and I'm way off base, it will help you recognize and respond to the emotional manipulations in real time and with communication. \n\nI wish you all the best.
