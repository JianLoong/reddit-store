We rarely get to see any of them, but when we do it's a lot of fun.\n\nLast year, we invited my brother, his wife and their 5 children to come visit us on a beautiful summer day.   We had a blast !  The kids played in the massive park across the street from us, my husband tooted around on the ridding mower with the little ones, we went strolling through our forest looking for bugs and creepy crawlies, and we had a bonfire to cook hot dogs and marshmallows.\n\nIn the evening, the kids and SIL disappeared into the house.  (We have the worlds smallest house, since it's just my husband and I that live here) so I went in to see what was going on.  SIL was changing all the kids into bathing suits.  \n\nI asked her what was going on, and she said she was going to pop the kids into the hot tub before they had to head home.  She never asked me if this was OK, she never talked to me about it ahead of time, and NO mention of the hot tub was brought up when we planned their visit.\n\nI politely told her that I do not want the children in our hot tub. \n\nSIL was NOT happy about this.  She said \"The kids are allowed in our hot tub at home, I don't see why they can't go in your tub.\"\n\nFirst, it's TOO HOT!  Husband and I have it set at 104, which is AS HOT AS IT'S LEGALLY ALLOWED TO GO!   \n\nSecond, it's only a 4 person hot tub.  Again, it's teeny tiny because it's just my husband and I here, and the tiny tub is all we need and could afford and really all we need.\n\nThird, the 5 kids are slathered in sunscreen, bug spray, dirt and sweat from being outside all day.  That much grime in the tub will mean it will destroy the water and we will have to drain the tub and refill it and re-balance it with chemicals.  \n\nShe got all huffy, changed the kids into pajamas instead and told everyone they were going home.  She marched the kids out to the van, told my brother she was ready to go and they all left.\n\nShe hasn't spoken to me since.  (and neither has my brother, but that's nothing new.  All my communication with my brother usually goes through SIL first.)   I sent her a text inviting them up again this summer for a visit since we haven't seen them since last year.\n\nHer reply \"No thank you.  Last time you were really rude and you upset the kids by not letting them in the hot tub. They just wanted to play in the water\"  \n\nI'm positive the only one upset that I wouldn't let the kids in the hot tub was HER.  The kids probably didn't give a hoot and definitely don't remember it.\n\nWas I the Ahole?  Should I just cave and let them in the tub this time knowing that I'll have to drain it and refill it after they leave?", "created_utc": 1682686091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131qs0k/aita_for_not_letting_children_into_my_hot_tub/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hot tubs \u2260 bathtubs. She can use her own bathroom at home to wash her dirty kids off.", "NTA - Why do parents think hot tubs are places for kids to play in?  I get that they are basically \"small-ish\" pools, but they are HOT TUBS, its not to played in, they are for relaxing and emotionally mature people, kids can get hurt in a number of ways especially if the parent decides not to pay attention (which I find most of the time).  UGH this one makes me so mad.  You are definitely in the right on this one.", "NTA - What is the deal with everyone feeling like the belongings of others is theirs? Kids don\u2019t belong in a hot tub.", "NTA - that's way too hot for little ones, and SIL should have asked you first, and not just assumed. That's also a \\*lot\\* of work for you to have to go through so the kids could splash around for a few minutes. What you guys could do, if she were willing to climb off her high horse for five minutes, is get a cheap little plastic pool and fill it up with water for the backyard, let the kids play in that. It doesn't have to be very big - or get one of those long plastic strips that sprays water, that kids can slide down (do they still make those? Am I seriously dating myself here?)   But again, this is \\*only\\* if SIL can stop acting like an ass for five seconds and talk to you because - to be very clear - you did \\*\\*nothing\\*\\* wrong. She was entirely out of line just assuming it was alright and then overreacting the way she did when you said no.", "NTA.

So why do they need to use yours? \n\nYour SIL was trying to get the kids cleaned up and was planning to use a dip in your hot tub in lieu of having to give them all baths when they got home.", "Her hot tub must be gross.

A hot tub is probably close to last on the list of things i want my 4 year old son touching", "NTA.  She was rude and entitled.  I would not have allowed the kids in the hot tub either.  First, you're right - it is way too hot and the dirt, sweat and sunscreen would have dirtied the water.  They didn't need to go in the hot tub and the fact that your SIL is continuing to be hostile over that minor issue reflects on HER and not you.", "NTA.

It sounds like SIL was planning on using your hot tub to wash dirt and grime off her kids. Ew!", "NTA.

Hot tubs aren't common where I live so I'm not sure if there are additional reasons not to let children in, but if the dirt was the issue it seems fairly easy to resolve.", "ESH..\n\nI garuntee the kids were upset as well.. not just her. Kids love those kinds.of things.\n\nShe shouldn't have been so entitled to use your hot tub... but your reasoning comes off as kid-phobic. Couldn't have just said, \"the hot tub is broken. We're getting it checked out next week\"?", "NTA Just respond to her text \"ok.\"", "NTA. Hadn\u2019t your sister in law heard of hyperthermia? That\u2019s too hot for kids.", "NTA.\n\n...and no, what your SIL should have said was \"last time, I was really rude and I upset my kids because I let them think we were doing something at someone elses house before I even bothered to ask if it was ok.\"\n\nI can assure you the kids definitely aren't holding a grudge and would probably love to come back.

Almost every one I\u2019ve sat in has a big sign saying no kids, no pets and no sex in the tub so it\u2019s a fairly standard rule as far as I\u2019m concerned.", "That sounds like that is exactly what she wanted to do - use it as a bath.  How does she NOT know how gross that is? Plus way too hot.\n\nSounds like a good thing they aren't coming back.", "NTA\n\nThat entitles mindset baffles me too!!\n\nThe ONE time I asked another kid if I could have his toy (and he said yes), my parents chewed me out so much that I never even played with the toy and hid it in the closet in shame.", "Oooh, I like that idea!  We had a \"slip 'n slide\" when we were kids and we loved it.  They must still make those, they were amazing!  I think this is a better idea than a small pool, it will still be too small for 5 kids.", "I'd also be conserved by what state SIL's hot tube was in.", "> 'someone else's feral kids' \n\nBest line ever!", "Yes, showering before a hut tub is the best way to make sure that the water quality isn't affected too badly.\n\nBut that doesn't solve the issue of the tub being 104 degrees.  If you've never been in a tub that hot, then you won't understand how hot that actually is.  It's definitely not safe for small children.", "So you\u2019re saying she should lie instead of have boundaries? SIL was being entitled, didn\u2019t ask OP and got pissed. Growing up, my family had a hot tub but we never assumed we could just use someone else\u2019s, especially without permission. Also kidphobic is a bs excuse. They literally invited the family and kids back over, they just didn\u2019t want them in the hot tub", "> Kids love those kinds of things.\n\nThey have one at home, so I am not sure if the \"novelty factor\" of \"something we do not have\" comes into play here.\n\nIf the woman wanted the kids in the hot tub, she could put them in *hers* when they got home.", "\u201cKid-phobic\u201d? How? Who wants dirty people of any age in their hot tub?", "I am not \"kid-Phobic\".  If I was, I wouldn't have invited them over in the first place.\n\nI'm just not willing to let 5 dirty kids in my small 4 person hot tub knowing that I'd have to spend an entire day draining the tub, cleaning it, and refilling it, balancing the water quality and waiting for it to heat up again.\n\nThey have a massive 8 person hot tub at their own house (and a pool), so the novelty of being crammed into my small hot tub is basically a moot point. \n\nAnd why would I lie and say it was broken, when it is clearly NOT broken?  I feel like I had perfectly valid reasons for saying no, and I shouldn't have to lie.", "Adults have every right to keep kids out of spaces they don\u2019t want them in. The kids were in fact dirty. That\u2019s not kid phobic. An adult covered in sunscreen and bug spray shouldn\u2019t go in either. She could have asked that they shower off first before going in. But it sounds like she had other valid reasons for not wanting them in there. I would have said it\u2019s not able to be used today or this hot tub isn\u2019t kid friendly. NTA.", "Eh, don't do it. Slip and slides are a pathway to broken bones and liability. Considering your SIL I just wouldn't.", "This. Plus if OP said the tube was broken, that would not have stopped the SIL on still wanting for the kids to use it.", "I missed that part.. fair point."]}
