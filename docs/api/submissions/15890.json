We rarely get to see any of them, but when we do it's a lot of fun.\n\nLast year, we invited my brother, his wife and their 5 children to come visit us on a beautiful summer day.   We had a blast !  The kids played in the massive park across the street from us, my husband tooted around on the ridding mower with the little ones, we went strolling through our forest looking for bugs and creepy crawlies, and we had a bonfire to cook hot dogs and marshmallows.\n\nIn the evening, the kids and SIL disappeared into the house.  (We have the worlds smallest house, since it's just my husband and I that live here) so I went in to see what was going on.  SIL was changing all the kids into bathing suits.  \n\nI asked her what was going on, and she said she was going to pop the kids into the hot tub before they had to head home.  She never asked me if this was OK, she never talked to me about it ahead of time, and NO mention of the hot tub was brought up when we planned their visit.\n\nI politely told her that I do not want the children in our hot tub. \n\nSIL was NOT happy about this.  She said \"The kids are allowed in our hot tub at home, I don't see why they can't go in your tub.\"\n\nFirst, it's TOO HOT!  Husband and I have it set at 104, which is AS HOT AS IT'S LEGALLY ALLOWED TO GO!   \n\nSecond, it's only a 4 person hot tub.  Again, it's teeny tiny because it's just my husband and I here, and the tiny tub is all we need and could afford and really all we need.\n\nThird, the 5 kids are slathered in sunscreen, bug spray, dirt and sweat from being outside all day.  That much grime in the tub will mean it will destroy the water and we will have to drain the tub and refill it and re-balance it with chemicals.  \n\nShe got all huffy, changed the kids into pajamas instead and told everyone they were going home.  She marched the kids out to the van, told my brother she was ready to go and they all left.\n\nShe hasn't spoken to me since.  (and neither has my brother, but that's nothing new.  All my communication with my brother usually goes through SIL first.)   I sent her a text inviting them up again this summer for a visit since we haven't seen them since last year.\n\nHer reply \"No thank you.  Last time you were really rude and you upset the kids by not letting them in the hot tub. They just wanted to play in the water\"  \n\nI'm positive the only one upset that I wouldn't let the kids in the hot tub was HER.  The kids probably didn't give a hoot and definitely don't remember it.\n\nWas I the Ahole?

TWO: They would have caused issues with the hot tub THREE: it was too hot for kids. \n\nYou are not the AH and you have nothing to apologize for.

After having four kids get in, you'd probably have to drain it and refill it. Huge mess. You're being kind letting them stay and its totally fine to have boundaries. Even some resorts won't allow kids in hot tubs. You sil needs to let that go. Hate that for you!", "You\u2019d be the ah if you let kids get in water that hot. Their skin at that age is a lot more sensitive.\n\nAlso all the dirt, sunscreen, etc would absolutely ruin the water and make a huge mess. It was extremely inconsiderate of her.

Around you?? In your small hot tub?? We have friends that don\u2019t even let other adults in their tub (the list is very selective and yes I am on it). Bye!!", "NTA.

It is not a swimming pool, and more importantly, it is not her hot tub to decide who goes in and who doesn't.", "NTA you SIL ASSumed she could use the hot tub.

Definitely NTA. We wouldn\u2019t even let our kids\u2019 friends in ours. First off, liability. Who knows if a child has some kind of heart issue or circulation issue where they might overheat easily\u2026 I\u2019d rather not get sued. Second, yours is way too small for 5 (5?!!) kids.. and of course, the previously mentioned gross bodies that would be ruining the water in your tub. \n\nLastly, your house, your rules, your boundaries.

Her feelings are somewhat valid because we can't control how we feel but she should think about why she was so upset about being told no. In the future she should better communicate. Also if they have a hot tub at their own home why is it such a big deal that they use yours? It isn't anything different or special from what they are used to. I think your SIL is more upset that she wasn't in control and was told no to what she wanted. I also think she wanted to use the hot tub as a way to clean the kids off a bit, which would indicate she didn't care how it negatively impacted you.", "Nta. When we were planning on letting my niblings into my parents hot tub we had to plan for it several hours ahead to get the temp down to a safe number... And our normal was only 100.", "NTA. A quick google search revealed to me that kids more prone to overheating than adults are. I learned that at 104\u00b0F, those kids would have had to leave the water for LESS THAN 4 MINUTES, which I am sure they would NOT have been happy about. Even, if the water temperature had been between 98\u00b0F and 102\u00b0F, the kids could only have been in for 15 minutes before needing to take a break - once again, I think that the kids would not have been happy about that. \n\nAt my house, we let our kids do things that they cannot do at other people's houses. FOr example, we let our kids draw on the walls of their own rooms (it's beautiful!). We also make sure that they know that just because you can do something at our house does not mean that they can do it at anyone's house. \n\nThe fact that they have a hot tub at home makes your SIL's reaction even weirder. It was not like you were denying the kids some fun opportunity that they never would have had otherwise. I wonder if SIL and her s/o were hoping to ''do'' something while the kids were in the hot tub? Or maybe it was a way to get them in bed early so that she could have a little more free time?", "NTA\u2026because it is your hot tub and your rules, but I might have told her if she showered/bathed the kids before hand, they then could use the hot tub for a bit and you can turn the heat down. Although quite frankly it is rude to do so without asking first.", "NTA, but, maybe you could have said pop them under the shower first to get the suncream off so it doesn't react with the hot tub chemicals. No need to mention dirt and sweat. If it was set on the highest temp they probably wouldn't have stayed in there for long anyway.", "Feel like you should have mentioned at the start that hot tub is off limits. Or told them to rinse before getting in.", "NTA - hot tubs are almost like pots of water on a stove. Adults bodies are bigger and won\u2019t be as disturbed by the hot water; kids are much smaller and are more likely to be hurt by the temperatures. Also, it\u2019s your hot tub. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not cheap to keep it maintained, and having to refill it would not help you out at all.", "NTA- and frankly, it\u2019s rude to assume you get to use any amenities at anybody\u2019s house. It would be rude even to just bring it up casually or ask permission. On top of this, you should casually sent her this Reddit post.", "NTA...children under 11 should not be allowed in hot tubs especially 104F as its affects their blood pressure. You did the right thing.", "A couple of things.\n\n* She was rude for not asking. \n* Hottubs shouldn't be used to clean, which sounds like what she was about to do.\n* Technically you shouldn't have to replace the water if they get in it, but that's one way to balance the levels, I suppose.\n* I don't think that's your call to say 'it is too hot for them', because 104 is within the 'legal' limit. Yes, that is hot, but the children could have made up their own mind. \n* Do you leave your hot tub on all the time?.. because that would explain why you said it was too hot. If you do, that seems like a waste. If you don't, and she saw you messing with it/turning it on, that makes a little more sense of why she assumed it was okay. \n\nNTA.", "INFO: how did you reply after her responding that her kids used their hot tub?  Did you calmly explain the reasoning you gave to us, or did you escalate the conflict?  The way you responded could change the answer for this post.", "You stuck out an olive branch and she refused it.

My aunt told my daughter no to the hot tub a few weeks ago because she just spent hours cleaning it. Your house, your rules! And that is way too hot for kids!!! Maybe tell her for next time 4 clean kids only at a time and you can lower the temp.", "NTA - apart from the water being contaminated and the water temperature I'd be concerned about 5 children being in the tub at the same time.

Using your amenity in the presence of guests without including them, is an asshole move.\n\nJust like it would be an asshole move to assume you could use someone else\u2019s amenity when they are not.
