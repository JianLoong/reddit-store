We rarely get to see any of them, but when we do it's a lot of fun.\n\nLast year, we invited my brother, his wife and their 5 children to come visit us on a beautiful summer day.   We had a blast !  The kids played in the massive park across the street from us, my husband tooted around on the ridding mower with the little ones, we went strolling through our forest looking for bugs and creepy crawlies, and we had a bonfire to cook hot dogs and marshmallows.\n\nIn the evening, the kids and SIL disappeared into the house.  (We have the worlds smallest house, since it's just my husband and I that live here) so I went in to see what was going on.  SIL was changing all the kids into bathing suits.  \n\nI asked her what was going on, and she said she was going to pop the kids into the hot tub before they had to head home.  She never asked me if this was OK, she never talked to me about it ahead of time, and NO mention of the hot tub was brought up when we planned their visit.\n\nI politely told her that I do not want the children in our hot tub. \n\nSIL was NOT happy about this.  She said \"The kids are allowed in our hot tub at home, I don't see why they can't go in your tub.\"\n\nFirst, it's TOO HOT!  Husband and I have it set at 104, which is AS HOT AS IT'S LEGALLY ALLOWED TO GO!   \n\nSecond, it's only a 4 person hot tub.  Again, it's teeny tiny because it's just my husband and I here, and the tiny tub is all we need and could afford and really all we need.\n\nThird, the 5 kids are slathered in sunscreen, bug spray, dirt and sweat from being outside all day.  That much grime in the tub will mean it will destroy the water and we will have to drain the tub and refill it and re-balance it with chemicals.  \n\nShe got all huffy, changed the kids into pajamas instead and told everyone they were going home.  She marched the kids out to the van, told my brother she was ready to go and they all left.\n\nShe hasn't spoken to me since.  (and neither has my brother, but that's nothing new.  All my communication with my brother usually goes through SIL first.)   I sent her a text inviting them up again this summer for a visit since we haven't seen them since last year.\n\nHer reply \"No thank you.  Last time you were really rude and you upset the kids by not letting them in the hot tub. They just wanted to play in the water\"  \n\nI'm positive the only one upset that I wouldn't let the kids in the hot tub was HER.  The kids probably didn't give a hoot and definitely don't remember it.\n\nWas I the Ahole?

And that tub would be too hot. \n\nThere was a local pool near me growing up that had a hot tub the highest it could go. Kids were only allowed above a certain age and only if the parent was also fully in the tub with them.
