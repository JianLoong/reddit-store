Tony\u2019s been acting strange and drinking heavily and it all came to a head one day. Next day, he disappears. \n\n Basically police get involved and everyone\u2019s out searching for him. I searched from about 2AM-7PM. The entire time, we were looking for his phone, his car, or his body. It was an incredibly stressful situation. The entire time I\u2019m thinking one of my good friends is dead and I\u2019m gonna find his body. I still can\u2019t get the image out of my head. \n\nHe was found by police the next day thank god, but he definitely is not there mentally anymore. He\u2019s getting the help he desperately needs now. \n\nI let hubby know I was out searching for my missing friend with police. I wasn\u2019t able to give anymore details on how serious the situation was because I was busy walking through fields and driving around searching, but a missing friend is still pretty effing serious on its own imo.\n\nSo the search is finally called off for me n my coworkers, it\u2019s in the hands of the police at this point. I go home. I am tired, dirty, and ugly crying. I ask hubby for a hug. He hugs me and says that he\u2019ll let me tell him all about it once he\u2019s done with his ranked game. I asked him if he could please not play rn and that I needed him, and he responds that he\u2019ll talk to me once he\u2019s done with that game because it\u2019s ranked and to go shower and he\u2019ll talk to me after we\u2019re both done. He turns back to his game and I shower then lay down in bed. I call my friend. My husband then comes in later and asks if I\u2019m still on the phone. I say no. He asks if I want to talk. I say no, go play your ranked game. He says okay in the most chipper voice and then doesn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the night. I fall asleep crying alone.\n\nNext day I text hubby and our entire convo is him giving me short responses, which he only does when he\u2019s mad at me. I say we need to talk when he gets home. When he got home we talked and I gave him the entire details on the whole situation, including my feelings about Tony missing and what I went through and how my husband treated me when I got back. I told him that him putting his game above his very obviously distraught wife, especially after I asked him to not play and that I needed him, was so hurtful I couldn\u2019t even describe it properly. I then addressed his short responses and that idk what he could possibly be mad at me for but that there is absolutely no reason he has to be mad. I told him I didn\u2019t care if he was mad because he has no right to be. I think that made him more mad because he hasn\u2019t said a word to me since. \n\nSo was I the AH in this situation and too emotional?\n\nAnd second question, am I an AH for telling my husband he has no reason to be mad at me, that I didn\u2019t care, and not letting him talk?", "created_utc": 1699148131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17o17ob/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_didnt_care_if_he/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He decided a video game was more important than his wife and her fear and her anguish. That is frankly revolting. I want you to think about what this means for you in the future.

Probably unpopular random side note/opinion, but whatever:\nYou need to learn to communicate what you really want, OP. When he did come in to chat, you brushed him off and told him to just go. Then you're mad he did just that, and left you crying alone.\nPeople need to stop being upset at their partners for not being mind readers and learn to communicate. If you wanted him to talk with you that night, then you should've said it when he came to you.

If you really think your game is more important than me right now, take it and play it somewhere else.\" It's such a terrible habit and common thing now a days when someone is so obviously upset, but then the other person asks if anything is wrong, or are you ok? And then instead of talking about it or communicating what's going on, they just say I'm fine. Everything's ok. Nothing's wrong, or whatever.

If you truly love that person, of course.", "Protip to downvoters(!!): if you are legitimately unable to determine whether your video game or your distraught, exhausted wife who *is in front of you crying her eyes out* is more deserving of your attention, you need to seek some goddamn fucking help.", "Everytime a red flag is raised, i think to myself, will they be able to see it?", "Ok? And isn\u2019t being single better then??", "She comes home dirty and distraught from running the streets \"looking for a coworker\" and didn't have time to loop him in. Her having a shower and then him coming immediately afterward as he said he would does not make him some game obsessed negligent.", "Especially when she had already been gone for 17 hours! He decided that right then he needed to game? \n\nAlso oh no OP was dirty. That wasn\u2019t his excuse his game was.", "I'm sure they would have a very productive discussion by shouting through the door over the running water.", "[deleted]", "And he said \"maintaining my ranking in this game is more important to me that being there for you after you've just gone through 17 hours of physically exhausting and emotionally wrenching work and are visibly distraught\"\n\nFixed that for you\n\nYou may wish to reconsider video games' place in your life if you're all over this post defending his actions like this", "He could\u2019ve got in the shower with her?

Apologies ^^;", "So fucking what, dude?\nAre you seriously telling me that you'd ignore someone you loved, right in front of you in the real world, crying their eyes out after returning from searching for a missing friend, to finish a match in the game?", "I also couldn't think of a game that takes longer than 5-15minutes to complete, but I guess league and valorant games can go on for an hour and a bit which I agree is too long and if you leave those games early you get a 3-7 day ban soo I dunno."]}
