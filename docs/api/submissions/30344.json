Tony\u2019s been acting strange and drinking heavily and it all came to a head one day. Next day, he disappears. \n\n Basically police get involved and everyone\u2019s out searching for him. I searched from about 2AM-7PM. The entire time, we were looking for his phone, his car, or his body. It was an incredibly stressful situation. The entire time I\u2019m thinking one of my good friends is dead and I\u2019m gonna find his body. I still can\u2019t get the image out of my head. \n\nHe was found by police the next day thank god, but he definitely is not there mentally anymore. He\u2019s getting the help he desperately needs now. \n\nI let hubby know I was out searching for my missing friend with police. I wasn\u2019t able to give anymore details on how serious the situation was because I was busy walking through fields and driving around searching, but a missing friend is still pretty effing serious on its own imo.\n\nSo the search is finally called off for me n my coworkers, it\u2019s in the hands of the police at this point. I go home. I am tired, dirty, and ugly crying. I ask hubby for a hug. He hugs me and says that he\u2019ll let me tell him all about it once he\u2019s done with his ranked game. I asked him if he could please not play rn and that I needed him, and he responds that he\u2019ll talk to me once he\u2019s done with that game because it\u2019s ranked and to go shower and he\u2019ll talk to me after we\u2019re both done. He turns back to his game and I shower then lay down in bed. I call my friend. My husband then comes in later and asks if I\u2019m still on the phone. I say no. He asks if I want to talk. I say no, go play your ranked game. He says okay in the most chipper voice and then doesn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the night. I fall asleep crying alone.\n\nNext day I text hubby and our entire convo is him giving me short responses, which he only does when he\u2019s mad at me. I say we need to talk when he gets home. When he got home we talked and I gave him the entire details on the whole situation, including my feelings about Tony missing and what I went through and how my husband treated me when I got back. I told him that him putting his game above his very obviously distraught wife, especially after I asked him to not play and that I needed him, was so hurtful I couldn\u2019t even describe it properly. I then addressed his short responses and that idk what he could possibly be mad at me for but that there is absolutely no reason he has to be mad. I told him I didn\u2019t care if he was mad because he has no right to be. I think that made him more mad because he hasn\u2019t said a word to me since. \n\nSo was I the AH in this situation and too emotional?\n\nAnd second question, am I an AH for telling my husband he has no reason to be mad at me, that I didn\u2019t care, and not letting him talk?", "created_utc": 1699148131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17o17ob/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_didnt_care_if_he/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if you were with a police force you wouldn't be involved in this way as it would be a liability to have you so panicked and emotional as you searched for him. The man was a drinker. Not a high priority for an immediate search party from the PD. The cops generally don't do search parties unless someone has been abducted/a child is involved. You then go home and expect your husband, who you haven't communicated with properly, to drop everything and comfort you about some guy from work disappearing for a bit.  Then when he said he was in the middle of a game and for you to go shower (when you admit you needed a shower), you reject his attention and tell him to go play some more. That's passive aggressive and won't help anything. Your hurt over him listening to you and giving you space is your own doing...then crying yourself to sleep like you've been wronged is absurd. Then you tell him he doesn't get to be mad at you and you don't care if he's upset. You're a major AH. This behavior is going to ruin your relationship.", "NTA, you did nothing wrong.

You just got home and you even said you were dirty. Maybe he wanted to give you a bit of space (and yes finish his game) so that you would be in a better space emotionally to be able to talk to him and have him comfort you. A shower does wonders when you\u2019ve been emotionally and mentally drained before essentially doing a word vomit of how you\u2019re feeling to someone. \n\nAs soon as his game was done, he came to you. Just like he said he would. I kinda think a soft YTA but, and pay attention here - he isn\u2019t completely faultless. Ranked or not, it\u2019s just a game but he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. He most likely would have told you to take a shower either way no occupied his time another way while waiting for you to finish. \n\nYour emotions were raw and you were exhausted.

You both disregarded each other\u2019s feelings.\n\nI guess I am just too old to understand the fascination with playing video games all the time.", "ESH here sucks for not forfeiting the tanked game and just taking the hit.
