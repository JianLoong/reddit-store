My mother (72F) does not like staying in hotels, so I decided to let her stay at our house during the week. We do not have a guest room, so I thought it would be a good idea to offer up my son's (17M) room. This way, mom will have a comfortable place to sleep, and my son can sleep on the couch downstairs. When I told my son this would happen, he was unhappy. He asked why it had to be him to give up his bedroom and not any of my other kids. I told him his bed would be the only one that would fit his grandmother and there was no way I was going to convince any of his siblings to sleep on the couch for a week. Obviously, my son was very upset at this, especially since the couch was right in the middle of our living room, so pretty much if people got out of bed before him, they would see him sleeping.\n\nWell, the party is over. My son ended up sleeping on the couch and is now mad at me. Today my husband (46M) told me that I shouldn't have \"forced\" my son to give up his room. However, I didn't force him to give it up, I just think it's always a good idea to teach my son that he needs to be compassionate to his grandmother, even if it means making sacrifices of his own.

That is not how it works. \n\nIf you don't give him the option to choose between empathy and non empathy, all he learns is that in your house it's \"my way or the highway\" and he'll just wait until he grows up, leaves and can do whatever he wants under his own roof. That is all. \n\nIf you were to ban all junk from your house and force feed vegetables only to your kids until they reach adulthood, it would not teach them to eat healthy.

If grandma doesn't like staying in a hotel why not get her to pay for one and offer your son that? He gets his privacy and she gets to stay in your home.

I don't talk to that uncle for reasons, and I always feel such hatred for him when I remember that moment.  I was forced to give up my own privacy and my place of safety to some jackass. Why didn't you give up your bed op?", "YTA. You're n t a for WANTING him to give up his bed but YTA for MAKING him do it, if you weren't willing to do it yourself. \n\nYou could certainly talk with all your kids about why, even though you and your spouse don't want to give up your bed, and even though you can't be arsed to take Grandma to a nice bed and breakfast or a boutique hotel that she'd love, they should still all be interested in volunteering their own rooms. \n\nMaybe they'd see your point of view.", "YTA hope one day when you come to visit he puts you on the couch LMAO", "I would definitely say YTA. I myself at 17 had to sleep on the couch for a month and a half at home because my mom thought it was a great idea for my 19 year old cousin (at the time), could stay with us when she was having relationship troubles.

Why couldn\u2019t you give up your room?", "NAH your son has a right to be upset he\u2019s a kid and his space is the most important thing in the world. but an elder should be given a bed and since that was only bed available that she would fit in that is unfortunately his bed. kids need to learn that when they are apart of a family sometimes they have to sacrifice and are not always going to get what they want. it\u2019s a lesson we all have to learn and they will have to learn as adults over and over so better to teach them young. if it was a weekly thing my opinion would be different sometimes sacrifices have to be made but should not be the norm.", "My parents wouldn't even have had to ask me. By 17, I  would have volunteered my bed for my grandmother.", "YTA. Your son lives there\u2014your mother doesn\u2019t.

I'll be 40 next month, but I was raised to respect my elders. If all the seats in a room are taken, the youngest was expected to get up & let the older person sit.

But I would. Obviously, couches aren't as comfortable as beds, but an elderly person needs the support of a bed instead of a couch. 17 year old can bounce back real quick from sleeping on the couch.", "YTA\n\nCompassion is a *voluntary* action. You FORCED him to give the bed up by telling him you'd already given it to his grandmother. You didn't teach him jack, other than the fact that his mother will kick him out of his own bed, regardless of whether he's okay with it or not. Volunteer your own bed, not someone else's. *That* would be compassion.", "YTA both for taking your son\u2019s bed without his consent and pretending that this was a lesson in being considerate when this was about your convenience.

Your son is still a minor and doesn\u2019t have the means or the ability to sleep elsewhere if you kick him out of his own room. He lives there; grandma doesn\u2019t. \n\nTell you what. Your mother can have YOUR bed. Your husband gets the hotel. You can take the couch. If paying for a hotel for your husband for the duration or your mother\u2019s visit sounds excessive, let him take the couch and you can sleep on the floor.", "A soft YTA. Only because we\u2019ve been sort of in that situation and there isn\u2019t enough info. Like do you sleep with a significant other, or just you and you could take the couch? Or share a bed with your mom? \n\nI don\u2019t think it should have been your 17 year old. It\u2019s a delicate stage, they NEED their own space, to feel like they have something that is theirs and you are pushing him out of his own cultivated space. A place where he can be himself and have privacy. \n\nNow I said a soft YTA because when my husbands parents come to visit we give them one of our kids room. Now it is a sacrifice for all, his parents included seeing as they are divorced and they have to share a room. They visit for weeks at a time and are a tad messy, take frequent naps at all hours of the day and his dad has a cpap we try to keep out of reach of the little ones. We have 3 kids, our one year old daughter sleeps in her own bed that is in our room, our 4 year old has her room and our 11 year old has his own room. While they visit we move our daughter to our room and set up two twins in her room so our son has his own space since he\u2019s older and needs it. Our daughter doesn\u2019t really care where she is placed. \n\nHowever this last time my son has since acquired a bed with an additional pull out bed underneath. We asked him (also stated it was ok if he didn\u2019t want to) if they could have his room (since that\u2019s where the extra twin mattress went) so they could put the bed away during the day and make room for all the extra stuff they have. However we also offered to move him to our 4 y/o room where he could have his own space and she would again go to our room. We\u2019d move his PlayStation and some clothes and his favorite things in there. He said he WANTED to sleep on the couch though and my husband took him backyard camping a few nights so he was excited about that. Which worked great because our daughter has insomnia (4 y/o) so she has weird sleeping hours. \n\nBut we gave him a choice and he was at an age where the privacy didn\u2019t matter as much to him. Maybe instead of just the couch, give your son a choice too. Like camping in the back yard, maybe sleeping at a friends house but being home early the next day for time with your mom? Or maybe one of your other kids actually WANTS to sleep on the couch. I was honestly surprised my son picked the couch instead of a room to himself. Maybe ask him what he wants or if he could come up with another suggestion? I know you mentioned his bed is the only one she can sleep on, maybe switch a bed out if he doesn\u2019t want to camp or go to a friends house? Just don\u2019t make him feel like you\u2019re taking his space from him.", "YTA. I would have asked your son rather than forced. Ask if he would be okay letting granny use his bed.\nAlso, if he didn't want to sleep in the living in room maybe you guys should offer to put a cot or air mattress in one of the siblings rooms so it's less awkward for whoever loses a bed? Or give up your own bed and you and your partner sleep on the couch or an air mattress? I understand not wanting granny to sleep on the couch it's definitely harder to do once you reach a certain age.", "YTA, also for using a misleading headline. You did not just want your son to give up his bed. You forced him.", "YTA-How you went about it was wrong. Why couldn\u2019t your son sleep on an air mattress in any other bedroom, including yours? Why did he have to be the only one to sacrifice his space?", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. \n\nI want to start off by saying many of times as a child/teenager, I\u2019ve had less than desirable sleeping arrangements when accommodating family, especially grandparents. And because my family respects their elders, they should be adequately situated- we want them comfortable. This was understood and we were fine with that.\n\nHowever, Seems like poor preparation of planning/communication on your part. If your mothers intention was to stay a week, why weren\u2019t the schematics of figuring out the sleeping accommodations done in advance? It seems as if a last minute decision was made in grandma overstaying her welcome and your son being displaced unnecessarily. If that\u2019s the case, grandma should have went home as no one in THEIR home should have uncomfortable living arrangements due to I\u2019ll planning. \n\nAdditionally, based on what you\u2019ve described, it seems there was no \u201cbuy-in\u201d from your son to get his thoughts, or anyone else\u2019s thoughts on the decision made. Depending on your location and school district, some kids are enjoying winter break. After working so hard in school and finishing exams during this stress induced time, the last thing I\u2019d want is not being afforded the opportunity to have my privacy and comfort made available.", "YTA. While I'm generally one to preach your house your rules, forcing a teenager to give up their bed is a line I wouldn't condone crossing. Beds are just one of those sacred things you don't share with just anyone... Not even grandma.", "YTA, you don\u2019t have the space so get a pull out for guests. Problem fixed and everyone who LIVES there gets to sleep in their own bed.", "It\u2019s kind of tough, but because you decided this would happen before consulting your son first and forcing him into it is definitely the reason he\u2019s mad at you. Also, how come you felt you couldn\u2019t \u201cconvince\u201d your son\u2019s siblings, yet you don\u2019t even try convincing your son and just force him to do it? Kinda close but I\u2019m going with YTA", "N T A for wanting one of your kids give up a room for their Grandmom. But you didn\u2019t even try to get one of your other kids to do it. You did kinda force him to do it  give your son a reward/do something nice just for him and make a rotation of who gives up their room and always do something nice for them doing that. YTA", "Yta his is the only bed granny would fit on? Do all the other kids have toddler beds?\n\nIn a nutshell, you offered up *someone else's space* without their input and are now *super shocked* he's upset. This was also HIS break which he did not get to use to sleep in and relax.", "Yep you sound like an asshole to me YTA.", "I mean I want to say NTA but I feel like we are missing some context. There\u2019s mention of other siblings but not their ages just that OP won\u2019t be able to convince them to give up their beds (but 17yo is a different story?). It\u2019s implied 17yo probably has the biggest bed or maybe the bed is the best height for Grandma?? It\u2019s not explained.\nBut overall it\u2019s not out of the norm to give up your bed/bedroom as a child for a visiting relative for a few days especially someone elderly. Good grief you\u2019d think OP had asked her kid to go sleep outside the way some people are going on in the comments.", "I grew up in a family were it was normal for kids to give  up their beds when elderly relatives stay. My sister and I shared a room so my brother would give up his bed for my widowed grandfather and my brother would sleep on a rollaway bed in the lounge. He would have been about 17. He did it willing though out of respect for his elders.  He volunteered before asked. Not sure what would have happened if he didn\u2019t want to\n\nMaybe that\u2019s how I was raised but I see nothing wrong with kids giving up their bed for elderly relatives for a short period of time.  \n\nHowever, you could have approached it asking your son and explaining why your mum needed the bed rather than demanding it. \n\n I don\u2019t think your son giving up his bed for elderly relatives for a few days is going to do any harm", "\"He needs to be compassionate to his grandmother\"\n\nSo do your other children.

If you want to accommodate your mother staying in your house, YOU make the sacrifice.", "NTA\n\nMy (32F) grandma came to stay with us several times a year and my brother and I grew up constantly switching off who would give up their room for the duration of the visit so my grandma had somewhere to stay. While we sometimes were bummed to lose our room, we also understood it to be what was respectful and we would never have wanted our grandma to not have her own space. I should mention I grew up very working class; no guest room, very small home and my grandma had no spare money. So her staying with us under this arrangement was necessary as a hotel was off the table and there truly was nowhere else for her to go within the home that was suitable.\n\nWhat was nice though is that my parents set up either a cot in the basement for us so that we didn\u2019t have to stay on the couch in the living room.

My mother (72F) does not like staying in hotels, so I decided to let her stay at our house during the week. We do not have a guest room, so I thought it would be a good idea to offer up my son's (17M) room. This way, mom will have a comfortable place to sleep, and my son can sleep on the couch downstairs. When I told my son this would happen, he was unhappy. He asked why it had to be him to give up his bedroom and not any of my other kids. I told him his bed would be the only one that would fit his grandmother and there was no way I was going to convince any of his siblings to sleep on the couch for a week. Obviously, my son was very upset at this, especially since the couch was right in the middle of our living room, so pretty much if people got out of bed before him, they would see him sleeping.\n\nWell, the party is over. My son ended up sleeping on the couch and is now mad at me. Today my husband (46M) told me that I shouldn't have \"forced\" my son to give up his room. However, I didn't force him to give it up, I just think it's always a good idea to teach my son that he needs to be compassionate to his grandmother, even if it means making sacrifices of his own.
