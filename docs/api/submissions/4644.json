My closest family lives six hours away in another state. I don't have anyone I can go to for assistance with things at home or with driving me anywhere. One of my jobs requires I have a working vehicle. I make home visits to clients throughout the day and need to be able to drive to/from those appointments. Plus the typical needs for a vehicle (groceries, pharmacy, medical appointments, laundromat, etc). Everything that needs to be done to care for myself and for my child is handled by myself.\n\nI recently purchased a new vehicle. My previous vehicle was one I owned for 12 years and was on its last leg. It needed repairs that were going to cost more than the vehicle was worth, so I just continued driving it without those repairs until it died, saving in the meantime to buy a newer more reliable vehicle. I've had this new vehicle now for one week and don't yet have all the paperwork up-to-date on it. And even if I did have all the paperwork up-to-date, I wouldn't want to let someone else drive it.\n\nMy neighbor is someone who frequently relies on me for rides. She had a vehicle that she allowed to be repossessed last year when she failed to make payments on it and has consistently asked for my assistance getting her places ever since. She has a husband and a 20-year-old daughter, but neither of them drive. Her husband doesn't have a license and her daughter is disabled. Her husband works at Walmart and always rides his bike to/from work or calls an Uber. She has cancer and has had hip surgery but will still often walk places if I'm not available to give her a ride when she needs/wants one.\n\nI don't have a problem helping with rides when I am available to do so, but I don't like or trust my neighbor. In the time I've been giving her rides, she's had me drop her off at a drug dealer's house, pick up a friend that crashed their vehicle DUI, and exchanged drugs with that friend in my vehicle. After that ride I told her I would not pick up friends for her again and that I don't want drugs in my vehicle and will not take her anywhere but work or grocery stores.\n\nToday, I'm sick with the flu. It's raining hard outside. I cancelled my appointments and stayed home, and I told my neighbor I couldn't give her a ride this morning because I felt too sick. She asked to borrow my vehicle. I told her NO.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1670959042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl46wh/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_neighbor_borrow_my/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stop helping this woman on demand. Personally I\u2019d stop helping her at all. It is far too risky and you don\u2019t owe her anything. Never loan her your car. She almost certainly doesn\u2019t have a license (probably for good reason), and she has already proven she\u2019s irresponsible and entitled. It is not a risk worth taking whatsoever. She won\u2019t be able to pay for any damages and insurance wouldn\u2019t cover anything. Let alone the fact you could be liable if she hurts someone else in an accident, or got caught doing illegal things.", "I want to thank everyone that's commented thus far and let you all know I won't be watching the responses closely anymore but will come back to read later.\n\nFor a bit further clarification - the drug issue was two separate incidents (the being dropped off at a dealer's house, and the picking up the DUI friend). At the time, I didn't know the drop off was a dealer. She asked me to drop her a block away because the friend didn't like people coming right up to his house and I was suspicious but didn't find out until after that the person was a drug dealer. And the DUI friend I didn't know was using - she just told me they'd wrecked their vehicle and needed a ride home. It was while I was driving and saw my neighbor make an exchange that I put it together and I would have kicked them out of my vehicle right then and there but felt unsafe.\n\nBoth of those incidents were last year closer to when she first had her vehicle repossessed and once I was home, I told her that the only rides I would give her would be to work and/or to a grocery store and that I would not permit any of her friends in my vehicle.\n\nThat part isn't what I feel like an asshole over. I definitely recognize that what she did there was dangerous and put me at risk, and I have been very careful to ensure she never leaves anything in my vehicle. Based on your comments, knowing she could still have drugs on her person even with the rides I've been willing to continue giving her, and that I could end up charged if ever pulled over while she has drugs on her has definitely changed my perspective on even giving her those rides. I do know, the ones she has though are ones she has a prescription for (pain medications) and she lets people buy pills from her, so its not something that would get \"caught\" during a stop. That's assuming she's being honest though and not involved with other drugs which... the drop off at the dealers house and her other behavior really leaves me not trusting her as someone who would be honest.\n\nI felt that information was important to include because it influenced my not trusting her and was a big part of why I don't want her driving my vehicle - because even if she drives safe and doesn't get in any wrecks, if I'm not there in the vehicle I can't enforce her not giving rides to others or doing anything drug related in my vehicle. And I can't trust that she would really just drive to work and back.\n\nThat being my reasoning did make me feel like an asshole, because I'm telling her \"no\" out of a lack of trust. Coming right out and telling her I don't trust her felt cruel. And just giving a flat \"no\" without explanation felt rude.\n\nBut anyway... your responses helped, because even without those details, you've all had a strong consensus that lending a vehicle to someone at all is a bad idea and having a \"I don't let other people drive my vehicle at all\" boundary is a good one to maintain. So, I didn't even need to explain that or how heavily reliant I am on my vehicle. I really felt like an ass, and my vehicle sitting right outside not being driven while she needed a way to get to/from work was bringing on an unnecessary guilt trip. Hence posting here.", "This is the third time she's asked to borrow my vehicle and the first time I've given her a direct no. The first time she asked, I ignored it (over text) and she ended up walking where she wanted to go. The second time she asked, I told her I could drive her (she was wanting to go to the grocery store).\n\nI feel like an asshole telling her no, because its raining so hard outside so she can't walk without getting soaked, she has cancer so I don't want to give her a ride while I'm sick and make HER sick, and I'm not going anywhere today since I'm staying home, so the vehicle is just sitting in my driveway.\n\nI don't have many people in my life that I interact with outside work, so maintaining boundaries isn't something I often have to do, and I've got some mental health issues (anxiety / PTSD) that make it difficult to suss out when my reasoning is sound and when its just me being overly anxious.", "I did limit her to only rides to work or grocery store after the incident with the drugs and told her I would not allow any of her friends in my vehicle. So, that part isn't a concern and is just part of why I don't trust her and feel uncomfortable with the thought of loaning her my vehicle.", "if you have a garage to park the vehicle in, please do so.\n\nat the least, make sure the vehicle is locked at all times if you don't have a garage to park it in.", "\"INFO: Does your neighbor or her family contribute to you or your family in literally any way?
