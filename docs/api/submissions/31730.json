Girlfriend made it very clear that he\u2019s crossing a boundary but he gas lit her to think that it was all in her head. You stepped in when she felt uncomfortable and attempted to gas light you and the other coworkers. \n\nYou did good!", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds to me like you're trying to protect her from him. However, you haven't even mentioned how your gf feels about what you did. Because you probably haven't even considered her feelings in this. She herself said she gets on really well with him, so why are you meddling? She is an adult, if he's annoying her, she can tell him herself. She doesn't need you \"saving\" her.\n\nOn the other hand, if you did it out of jealousy/insecurity about your relationship, you can't tell him to back off because she's not your property. In the case she decides to leave you for him, she's free to make that choice. You don't own her.", "NTA as long as you read your gf correctly and didn't cause problems at her workplace. It would have been better to check with her if she wanted you to help first.", "Bruh the disrespect! He hitting ony your shorty in front of you!!! BRUH WHAT?!?!

Would you just happily sit back and let your partner get harassed and bothered?", ">On the other hand, if you did it out of jealousy/insecurity about your relationship, you can't tell him to back off because she's not your property. In the case she decides to leave you for him, she's free to make that choice. You don't own her.\n\nUtterly wrong and peak reddit. She'd be leaving him for a man that could protect her. This is just butthurt about normal male behavior.", "Plus, she has to work with him. If she's not polite, there can be reprocussions for her - and not if her bf takes care of it.", "I understood that, but then you escalated it with him and told him to back off. Which, again, I don't think it was totally uncalled for, but I don't see why your girlfriend couldn't have done that for herself if she wanted. It's not a big deal though, you were looking out and I'd have done the same.", "Fair enough, didn't interpret her telling him to wait as \"You're annoying me, please stop\". If that's what that was, then I would be more inclined to say NTA.", "Is normal male behavior also hunting and providing for the pack, caveman?", "It sounds like the gf was tactfully pushing back and creating distance. From the details shared she\u2019s consistently done that properly. She did nothing wrong.\n\nIt sucks this is the world we live in, but this guy sounds like the type who wouldn\u2019t listen to her and it needed the bf (a man) to say something to get him to back off. The only AH here is the shady guy. OP played this right and helped his gf. \n\nNTA", "Yes history is where male-female interactions evolved"]}
