We split our rent and bills 50/50. When it comes to grocery shopping we also split it 50/50 then whenever we need something outside of this such as bread and milk, I'll tend to grab it. I don't ask for the money because it's small amounts. A few times a week my gf will ask if I will go to grab her some chocolate or crisps etc. I don't mind because it's not a lot of money and I'd like to think she'd do the same for me. \n\nWe went for a walk today we needed some milk so we went into the shop and my gf got the milk and paid. She mentioned money I had to transfer her from the previous night so I started transferring it and then she said \"oh add 50p on for the milk\". I started laughing because I thought she was joking but she made sure to tell me she was being serious. She asked what was wrong and I point out all the things I buy for her when she asks and never ask for the money yet she can't even buy a bottle of milk without needing the money back. She argued it shouldn't be a problem because it's not much. I told her I'd transfer it but told her she can stop asking me to buy her little things during the week now because it's very clear that it only goes one way so she can get it herself.\n\nShe got annoyed and said I wasn't being fair and the things I get her are just little treats. I disagreed since if it was a treat I'd get her it because I want to and not because she repeatedly asks. She said I was being unreasonable and starting an argument for nothing.

She wants 50p back for milk that - I assume - she\u2018s also drinking?!", "NTA - Sounds like your girlfriend is creating one rule for you and one for herself. It\u2019s small until it piles up and gets bigger and the resentment grows. I think you should establish what you both expect and what applies in this 50/50 situation you have going on and if you\u2019re both equally on board with it. What\u2019s petty to some because bitter resentment to the other. Good luck op", "NTA\n\nAnd the answer here is obvious: you can still get her the snacks she wants if you're at the shops and she's not.  But make sure to send a money request to cover the cost.  If she want's to account for every penny, account for every penny.", "NTA, and some people are just like that... No big deal when it's in their advantage but then becomes an issue when they're on the giving end.\n\nGreat you kindly told her, and if she feels it's no big deal, simply charge her on every 'no big deals' she asks you to bring. I think it's better than telling her to not ask anymore:)", "NTA. I know you said you'd \"like to think she'd do the same for me\" but I think you now have your answer.", "NTA. Being petty goes both ways. If she wants to get 50p, she should pay 50p", "NTA, that's ridiculous.", "Oh. Yeah. I was surprised at how cheap the milk is where you live. But anyway it\u2018s ridiculous of her to ask that.", "NTA. I know it's small and petty and really shouldn't be a thing, but she can't really say you're being unfair when you always buy the odds and ends and never ask for cash. It's quite odd she would actually ask you for half the price of the milk like that. But yeah, it sort of shows you a little about her now because she has no problem when you buy things but when it's her, you have to split it.", "I\u2019ve been in this exact discussion/argument. What worked for me and my partner is using Splitser instead of transferring cash back and forth. Every time one of us paid for something, it was put in the app and we track the balance. Its quite interesting to see how much the \u2018small treats\u2019 cost over times. \n\nNTA Best of luck. :)", "NTA when people show you who they are, believe them!", "Remember to do the same to her from now on.", "NTA and damn, boy.. she's unbelievable petty and stingy. there's absolutely no future with such a person unless she changes her way of thinking. she should get free food but you should pay her 50p?? 50p?? are you serious??? just HOW stingy must someone be in order to ask you to transfer 50p?... this is stinginess taken to a whole other level.", "Next time she asks you to bring home chocolate or crisps, ask for half of the cost before you give it to her.  If she refuses, open it up and eat it yourself right in front of her.  NTA.", "NTA - your gf sounds petty and cheap AF", "NTA. If you're gonna be 50/50, then it's all the time or not. She can't ask you to pick up things for her and not do the same back", "NTA. She made your relationship completely transactional. Thats exhausting imo. The main things 50/50. But the inbetween stuff. Get me. Ohh but i got this pay me back.", "NTA and of course she is arguing because she wants you to continue. Too bad. She burned her bridges.", "Nta.  Why don\u2019t you open a joint account for things you split.  You each put in the same amount and use it for things you split.  It takes all the guess work as to who owes who what.  But also asking for splitting small amounts is just annoying.", "I'm going with a weird judgment of **NAH**. I'll explain.\r  \n\r  \nYes, gf is being petty and should have just let it go. I can follow her thought process, though. Groceries are split 50/50. Milk is definitely a grocery item. Therefore, 50/50 split.\r  \n\r  \nThings might have been different if you hadn't been in the process of transferring money. In that case, she *might* have just let it go as not being worth the accounting, similar to what you do.\r  \n\r  \nSo far, this is a one-time petty thing. If she has or develops a pattern, then she's TA. And if you decide that from now on, her treats go into the accounting, you're N T A for it.", "Info: do you both earn/have similar incomes?\n\n\nHave you considered that if she asks for the 50p maybe she is struggling?", "NAH. \n\nBuying treats and buying groceries you both use are different things. Treats are little gifts, and she clearly sees it that way. If she\u2019s asking you to pay for half of the milk, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable. I think this was mostly miscommunication. \n\nIf you want her to buy you treats, then ask. But I don\u2019t see the big deal in splitting groceries down the middle. Yea for milk it\u2019s a little silly, but still. Its like saying \u201cwell why would I buy chicken for tonight when I got you a birthday present a week ago.\u201d They\u2019re just different things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
