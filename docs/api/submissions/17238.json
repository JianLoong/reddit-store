We split our rent and bills 50/50. When it comes to grocery shopping we also split it 50/50 then whenever we need something outside of this such as bread and milk, I'll tend to grab it. I don't ask for the money because it's small amounts. A few times a week my gf will ask if I will go to grab her some chocolate or crisps etc. I don't mind because it's not a lot of money and I'd like to think she'd do the same for me. \n\nWe went for a walk today we needed some milk so we went into the shop and my gf got the milk and paid. She mentioned money I had to transfer her from the previous night so I started transferring it and then she said \"oh add 50p on for the milk\". I started laughing because I thought she was joking but she made sure to tell me she was being serious. She asked what was wrong and I point out all the things I buy for her when she asks and never ask for the money yet she can't even buy a bottle of milk without needing the money back. She argued it shouldn't be a problem because it's not much. I told her I'd transfer it but told her she can stop asking me to buy her little things during the week now because it's very clear that it only goes one way so she can get it herself.\n\nShe got annoyed and said I wasn't being fair and the things I get her are just little treats. I disagreed since if it was a treat I'd get her it because I want to and not because she repeatedly asks. She said I was being unreasonable and starting an argument for nothing.

No big deal when it's in their advantage but then becomes an issue when they're on the giving end.\n\nGreat you kindly told her, and if she feels it's no big deal, simply charge her on every 'no big deals' she asks you to bring.

Being petty goes both ways. If she wants to get 50p, she should pay 50p", "NTA, that's ridiculous.", "Oh. Yeah. I was surprised at how cheap the milk is where you live. But anyway it\u2018s ridiculous of her to ask that.", "NTA. I know it's small and petty and really shouldn't be a thing, but she can't really say you're being unfair when you always buy the odds and ends and never ask for cash. It's quite odd she would actually ask you for half the price of the milk like that.

I can follow her thought process, though. Groceries are split 50/50. Milk is definitely a grocery item. Therefore, 50/50 split.\r  \n\r  \nThings might have been different if you hadn't been in the process of transferring money. In that case, she *might* have just let it go as not being worth the accounting, similar to what you do.\r  \n\r  \nSo far, this is a one-time petty thing.

Treats are little gifts, and she clearly sees it that way. If she\u2019s asking you to pay for half of the milk, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable. I think this was mostly miscommunication. \n\nIf you want her to buy you treats, then ask. But I don\u2019t see the big deal in splitting groceries down the middle. Yea for milk it\u2019s a little silly, but still.
