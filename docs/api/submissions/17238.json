I started laughing because I thought she was joking but she made sure to tell me she was being serious.

She argued it shouldn't be a problem because it's not much. I told her I'd transfer it but told her she can stop asking me to buy her little things during the week now because it's very clear that it only goes one way so she can get it herself.\n\nShe got annoyed and said I wasn't being fair and the things I get her are just little treats.

Are you expecting to get some different answer?", "ugh this makes me icky. my wife and i never shared accounts. we never split the bill evenly. if you happen to pay for something than you happen to pay for it. not like it does matter if you both consume groceries. we have a comlete imbalance in the finance and doesnt matter jack shit to us. NTA", "NTA. If your income is higher than hers you can choose to spend a bit more on groceries or treats, but that should be your decision. And if it isn't, your gf is being unreasonable. Might be a good idea to let her calm down a bit and then have a talk about finances. People in relationships often just fall into routines without talking about them first, so if this isn't working for you, a quick chat about money might be helpful!", "NTA. Break up with her.", "NTA oh did her greed just back fire? Such a shame/s\n\nUnless she has some Serious redeeming qualities I\u2019d be considering a gf renewal", "ridiculous I lived with my partner through tough financial times , we split bills 50/50 but if one is short in a shop the other just pays we have never transferred money .", "I get 1 gallon for anywhere between $3-5 depending on where i go.", "Those are probably still subsidised. Just less so as you aren't keeping up with CAP", "Lmao what? My partner is easily more than twice my size and if I wasn't 8 months preggo and already squished af I could easily eat twice what he does \ud83e\udd23", "I pay about that for a half gallon....", "same here, about $3 a gallon, maybe supermarkets are using milk as a loss leader", "We also pay about $3/gal", "And everyone that eats more is a man?", "NTA. Your gf is cheap.", "\" *I don't mind because it's not a lot of money* ***and I'd like to think she'd do the same for me.\"***\n\nYou mean she hasn't done this already, in the TWO YEARS you have been together?\n\nNTA - she will never change. If she is grabbing every penny back off you at this point, this will only get so much worse the longer you are together.", "NTA tell her if it's such a small amount she can get it herself and next time you go to the shop ask her for money too.", "NTA.   Your GF is ridiculous!", "NTA", "Gawd, next thing you'll be taking home the milk and dividing it into his and hers containers so you both get your 50% of the damn milk. Pick your color now and get a whole set of food keepers in that color.  You'll need one for milk, one for bread, one for butter, one for catsup, at least two for salad dressings, one for orange juice, one for mayo, one for mustard, one for eggs, one for ... well, everything so neither one of you gets cheated into paying more.  Best figure out a way to divide the paper towels, sandwich bags, detergent, dish soap, and toilet paper too.  And while you're at it, make sure you divvy up the new bottles of cold medicine, toothpaste, floss, shampoo and hand soap.  Your girlfriend is demented.  NTA", "Welcome to women's world. Where their money is theirs and your money is 'ours'. NTA. Stand firm against that greedy broad.", "NTA.\n\nYou have learned a valuable lesson, so I would not seem petty and raise the issue too much.\n\nBut I would start charging everything, including snacks or other \"little things\" for which she asks.", "NTA - petty to ask for small amounts. The splitting should be reciprocal, if you don't ask for repayment on small things that should go both ways. Claiming them to be gifts when she asked for them is also pretty weird and entitled.", "NTA and you\u2019re right, stop getting her shit if she wants to count pennies.\n\n> She argued it shouldn't be a problem because it's not much. \n\nSo why did she make it a problem then? Everyone is feeling the price increases but if it isn\u2019t going both ways then she\u2019s just taking the piss.", "Make sure you draw a line in the middle of the milk bottle and let her use it first. When she reaches the line she's done. If she uses any under that line it's yours and she owes you money. Sarcasm in case it was missed. NTA", "NTA, she wanted to follow the rules, now she can follow the rules.", "NTA. I dated someone like this and called them out the same way you did. I\u2019m a little more firm tho, I just told them that I understand how they would prefer things and I\u2019m happy to adjust to their method of nickel and diming. I didn\u2019t back down. I requested 50% of everything down to the penny. Eventually we started operating on more of a give and take, but it took him understanding that his lack of generosity was hurtful and that I wasn\u2019t kidding about adjusting to his method.", "Each other?\n\nThis is a one way street the guy has consistently & contentedly been bringing extras in.", "So, in other words, your money is half hers, and her money is hers.\n\nEvery couple needs to work out a financial split that works for them but when you choose 50/50 it has to be a clean 50% of all SHARED expenses and 100% of all personal expenses, meaning, if she wants you to pick up some chocolate for her whole you are out, she needs to pay you back before you give them to her. If she wants you to pay for her personal items, then she needs to be flexible on the financial split", "And add transport and time costs lol", "Yes, but he's considering joining in so they might as well be efficient about it.", "Less than a 2pint now.

I got really excited, then realised they had an expiry date of the next day.  I still bought three bottles.  Milk lasts at least several days beyond the date.", "I'm Aussie and I brought the coles home brand 3L milk on Sunday for $4.50 ($4.05 Canadian), and that was the cheapest 3L they had. We go through atleast 6L of milk per week", "At Coles it's $3.10 for a 2L bottle of Coles milk, and I think Woollies is about the same."]}
