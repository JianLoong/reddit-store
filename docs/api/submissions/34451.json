I am admittedly running 5 mins late finding a parking spot, but when I get there I finally find my family. \n\nThere\u2019s only one problem, there\u2019s no seats available. I look over and see my cousins kid- who\u2019s like 4, who I assume wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. My family greeted me and is asking me to pull up a chair. But there is none, this place is literally packed. Plus there\u2019s not a lot of room already at the table. \n\nSo here I am, I\u2019m already an introvert, standing there looking dumb in the middle of this big fancy restaurant. \n\nI told my aunt I\u2019d try to go find a chair and literally just left. \n\nThroughout the dinner, I just texted them happy birthday and said that I didn\u2019t know what to do and left. I think they were pretty upset with me.\n\n**Edit:** after talking to my parents, no one was \u2018mad\u2019 just wondering where I went. I think they understood. The child in question was not supposed to be there, it\u2019s your typical adult dinner. The place was very crowded, like family\u2019s waiting in the lobby to be seated, and is the type of place that you call well in advance to make a reservation. I felt like if I took a chair, I would be unfairly taking away another family\u2019s chair- which wasn\u2019t right. I have no harsh feelings towards my cousin or their child.. shit happens.

If you want to function in society you need to address this with professional help. This will work against you in your career, love life and every other aspect. You need to be able to advocate for yourself.", "As a serious introvert I can wholeheartedly understand why you left, but YTA because there were so many things to do other than lie and leave. You could have asked restaurant staff to help with table seating, you could have asked family members you\u2019re more comfortable with to assist in making space. Barring a seating solution, which I\u2019m positive would\u2019ve been found, you at the very least should\u2019ve said your apologies and goodbyes in person rather than say you were going to find a solution and then just dip out of awkwardness.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA to start. I understand showing up to a celebration and immediately feeling uninvited. It has nothing to do with being an introvert to me.\n\nHave things like this happened to you before? It happened to me one too many times so I started declining invitations. I\u2019ve been skipping family weddings for years because I don\u2019t want to go through the effort to deal with family aggression after getting a suit ready then booking a trip and a hotel room.\n\nIf I showed up to a celebration and there wasn\u2019t a seat for me, I\u2019d fuck off too - maybe with a dignified announcement or saying \u201csomething came up\u201d (which would not have been a lie for you since it had just come to your attention that a seat was not ready for you after having to deal with finding a parking spot) because I\u2019d try my best to let them know that my time is important to me, and the organizer did not even make the most basic consideration of saving you a seat.\n\nI assume that your reaction was more based on the group of people than you being an introvert.", "They should have known to move the kid.  Recently decided I am not  staying anywhere I\u2019m not even considered. I\u2019m tired of stating the obvious . This was obvious.", "YTA. First off, I'm an introvert and I can go to a restaurant just fine. You are describing something more akin to agoraphobia or intensive social anxiety, to the point you can't even speak to your *family*, rather than simple introversion. Going to a restaurant is NBD. Asking for another chair is NBD. Respectfully, if this is how you conduct yourself, it seems like you need some professional support because this behaviour is not normal.", "NTA.  If you make reservations for 10, it's for 10 people.  Not 11, not 12... 10.  If there wasn't room to squeeze in another chair, there wasn't room.   And if there was, the child should have to sit in it because they're smaller and don't need the elbow space.", "You refer to the cause of you leaving to you being an introvert and most comment address this, but I think the real reason why you felt like leaving like that is that you \\*felt hurt\\* because no-one thought of saving you a chair and no-one got up to help you out and take some action to sort out the situation with you. Did you feel excluded and maybe you don't want to word it like this because it feels childish? Some people may be triggered by something like this, especially if you have an ongoing frustration due to feeling you're often taken for granted/not at the center of attention, which may be the case if you're an introvert. Correct me if I'm wrong, maybe I'm projecting a lot here, but I think it's a combination of things.\n\nI don't like to jump to black/white YTAs or NTAs when I feel there's much more I don't know to an issue than the single episode brought up here. Maybe you didn't mean to be rude or make a statement by leaving, but you felt overwhelmed with negative emotions linked to previous experiences and couldn't cope with it in that moment.", "YTA. I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind reading these comments. From one introvert to another: pull yourself together. Sometimes you have to deal with unexpected situations, that\u2019s just life.\n\nYou turned up late and there was one extra person there. This isn\u2019t a major crisis. If you can\u2019t find a chair, ask a waiter. Then ask people to scooch. If there literally isn\u2019t a single chair in the entire restaurant, then fine - say you\u2019re leaving and be on your way. Walking out without saying anything was a ridiculous move.", "YTA. You just had to ask a waiter or host to set a place for you. It\u2019s literally their job to help. I am really tired of seeing people use the fact they are an introvert as the reason they can\u2019t do basic human interactions. I\u2019m an introvert too, but I can ask for help. It was impolite to leave without saying anything.", "I'm gonna have to go with ESH. If you are having a party at a restaurant, you save a seat for the entire party - you tell the restaurant how many people are coming and they make sure there's that many at the table. It sounds like your family did not bother doing that (or brought someone who wasn't meant to be there without telling the restaurant)so that's on them. They hold the responsibility for causing the circumstances that led to the situation. However, leaving without saying something is not really good either. I get it as an introvert with anxiety, but if there's no seats you can just tell them that - you don't really have to ask the staff, if your anxiety is acting up you can just pretend \"hey, I checked there's so seats, I guess I'll have to leave\". You could even leave and just say in the text \"I'm really sorry, there was nothing to be done, there are no seats\". You should have handled the leaving better. Learning moment for next time. Managing anxiety in these situations is not easy, but it is something we need to learn to do.\n\nIf they are upset with you - I'd have a talk with them and frankly explain the situation. Anxiety is a mental illness and deserves respect - and once you explain that many people will do so.", "Going against the grain and saying NTA. Had the exact same thing happen at a family gathering, but at a relatives house. I sat all by myself in the loving room and cried while I ate since nobody could see me. If the place was packed and you have social anxiety, which is sounds like, there's no way wait staff would be able to comfortably accommodate. This is coming from a former server. Sure, you could have pulled a chair up, and then everyone would have been crammed like sardines without room for many plates and drinks and just be uncomfortable in an already busy place. I completely understand why you left. Especially if you were a planned and expected guest...that's just rude to not save a seat for you.", "Idk y\u2019all\u2026. I\u2019m not a gen z, and I think it\u2019s a little inhospitable not to ensure there are enough seats for everyone you invited to your birthday dinner.  I think OP probably feels hurt.  I would.  I kinda get it.", "NTA You were invited to a family dinner but there was no seat for you and nobody bothered to get you one. You probably felt unwanted.\nYou left\u2026\u2026fair enough.", "Dude shows up to a birthday party well within the window of error (5 minutes is not \"late\" for a dinner lol), finds that no one bothered to save dude a seat, and y'all are collectively saying that's his/her fault?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nY'all are fucked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnta", "I\u2019m really surprised at all the Y T A comments, whoever made the reservation should have included the child so there would be enough seats. Maybe leaving was a little drastic but them expecting you to run around and find yourself a seat is rude on their part. If the child was a last minute addition they should\u2019ve addressed that when they got to the restaurant. NTA your family should have a higher regard for you.", "My fiance is a huge introvert and I would have broken up with him if he has done something like this. This is not being introvert,this is being rude and if you try to evade people this level because it makes you feel bad I mean with the best way,you need some serious amount of help and if you were my family member,I would not be talking to you,ever again.", "You are not the asshole. They knew you were coming and could have made sure you had a chair. It sucks that not a single person in the group made you feel welcome.\n\nThey put their lack of consideration on you. I\u2019m impressed you had the courage to say nope, see ya later. \n\nPeople will try to make you look bad to cover up their fail. Then they don\u2019t have to feel bad because you do that for them.", "The family member should have removed the child from what was obviously your chair as soon as you turned up. Or alternatively ensured you had a place ready as they\u2019d taken yours. \n\nHaving said that, all whoever was hosting had to do was ask the waiter to set up another place before you got there. \n\nIt was a tad over the top just walking out, but I can sort of understand why you did \n\nNTA, tho with some reservations", "Your cousin should have IMMEDIATELY snatched up their kid and held him in their lap for the rest of the evening.  There was no place for you to sit--- why are people upset with YOU and not your cousin?", "Apparently a controversial opinion, but NTA. This really isn't about introversion, it's about poor, inconsiderate planning at a restaurant. Guests need to be specific about how many seats are required, both for their party's comfort and to make it easier on the staff. Plus, trying to reshuffle chairs and place settings in a crowded restaurant could be disruptive to other tables. Unless the extra guest was literally passing by on the street and, total coincidence, joined the dinner last minute, another diner should have told the staff ahead of time. \n\nSure, it's passive aggressive for you to leave without stating your intentions, but I'd argue that your behavior only harmed yourself. If your presence was so essential to others, why didn't they have a seat waiting for you? No one is obligated to stay at an event if they feel disregarded or uncomfortable.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t feel welcome because no one accounted for you showing up, even though I assume they knew you were on your way. It wasn\u2019t your birthday, and you didn\u2019t want to make it about you and make a scene. There were 10 people already, so it was hardly intimate anyway. I assume you ghosted because you didn\u2019t feel like your presence would be missed, and the whole situation was uncomfortable. If anyone asks, continue to not make it about you. Just say that the restaurant was packed and crazy, and you didn\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone, and offer some one-on-one time with any family you actually did care to see.", "ESH.\n\nYou were invited and you accepted.   The hosts (aunt and uncle) knew you were coming so why wasn't there a place for you at the table?\n\nThe person who brought the 4 yo was an AH.  Don't bring a 4 yo to a nice featuring and take the seat of an invited adult.\n\nYou just left without trying to grt a seat.  You should have spoken to the host or a server.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA\n\nYour family should have informed the staff that they needed one more seat while they waited for you. Surely it was easy to see that every seat was taken? I always triple check to make sure we have enough seats at a restaurant because in my experience, no seat means no plate/utensils. Plus I love a good old Irish exit", "NTA They knew you were coming and didn't care enough to save a seat for you. You were right to leave.", "Info : I see a lot of comments about the 4 year old so I'm just going to straight up ask op. You wrote that you **assumed** the child wouldn't be there, do you know that they were or were not invited? \n\nTbh I get it it sucks being an introvert. But it's kinda rude to just walk out not wish the birthday guests happy birthday because you felt slighted.", "Man you people are something else. Ole boy shows up 5 min late (thats not late enough for any action to have been taken due to his absence) to an annual event hes attended before. Social anxiety aside he has every right to expect his seat at the table to not be given to a toddler who shouldnt be there.

YTA op. there were  many things you could've done before just leaving. 1, asked the parent of the child if the child could sit on one of their laps. 2, asked a waiter for a chair. 3, if that's too much for you, ask a family member to ask for you. 4, you simply could've told them you were leaving instead of being a coward and lying.", "As and introvert and restaurant employee, why wouldn\u2019t you just wait for an employee to pass by and ask if you could borrow an extra chair. If the restaurant is fancy, they definitely have a hostess at the entrance, couldn\u2019t you just go there and ask? Being an introvert is one thing, but not being capable of thinking of a solution for such a minor inconvenience is something entirely different. Yup, subtle YTA.", "NTA. There wasn't a spot for you at the table, and no one thought you save you one, so you left.

You were an asshole for the way you handled things. I will echo the comments about introvert and social anxiety. I have both so I feel well equipped to answer. Being an introvert usually means that not only are you not a fan of people but it is very exhausting mentally to be around them for long periods of time. We run out of battery quicker compared to extroverts when it comes to being social. Social anxiety is what I can describe of as this constant background fear. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re in public and your mind is constantly telling you you\u2019re in danger but you don\u2019t know why. But it can be worked on with a professional and symptoms can be managed very well. It is a mental illness that I completely acknowledge you have no control over it, but you do have the control to seek treatment. \n\nI do however think the other party is an asshole. What you did was rude but it is also incredibly rude to not plan accordingly. I would also be miffed if my family did that. It may have not been the intention of them but I\u2019d definitely feel forgotten or unwanted in the situation. It\u2019s wild to me that people think that\u2019s acceptable behavior as a host. If they\u2019re accusing you of bad manners they should also accuse the host with bad manners. Being the person celebrated or the person hosting does NOT give you a free pass to be an asshole. Maybe it was the way I was raised, but hosting is a very important honor and responsibility. I\u2019d be told off by my family if I didn\u2019t properly accommodate my guests, and making sure everyone has seats is the bare minimum.", "NTA, maybe everyone sucks, but I\u2019m sticking with n t a because of the y t a\u2026\n\n I am an introvert.

The family should have had a seat for op upon arrival. Leaving someone to search for a seat is rude/uncomfortable and in bad taste. I would have told them I was leaving tho.

If the reservation was for your family, and the small child wasn't supposed to be there, then that fault lies with whomever is responsible for the child. I understand you not being able to find a seat. I dont understand people telling you to just ask a group if you can have a chair- especially since this place is clearly reservation type.

If perhaps, you need an extra chair, write down so, and when staff comes by for your family, offer said paper, if talking to them stresses you.\n\nIf anything, the family slightly sucks for not trying to rectify the problem before you got there.

You can pretty much guarantee, based off that info, that there were legitimately no seats left, and even if there were, it would suck having to cram an additional full-sized adult into a table already at capacity.

Coping skills are grown over time, and they can atrophy if you don't use them. But if you can manage the anxiety long enough to do one uncomfortable thing (in this case, ask a waiter for a chair), it builds confidence and the next uncomfortable thing doesn't seem so bad. Little steps make anxiety manageable; avoiding those steps make it bigger and harder to handle. \n\nI have seen a friend basically become housebound because they let their anxiety be the excuse for never trying. At this point, they would need medical intervention to address their anxiety, but it could have been managed much more easily ten years ago if they had pushed themselves a little. But as they stopped pushing themselves, more and more tasks felt too hard until everything was too hard. Anxiety can certainly be a reason for why trying is hard, but it isn't an excuse to never try. A lot of people have trouble realizing that those two things are different though. Being anxious doesn't mean someone has an anxiety disorder, but it can certainly grow into one if they don't take the steps to manage their anxiety.

Diagnoses are made based on observed behavior, and there may be another reason for the behavior, so an autism diagnosis was not the best one. \n\nWhat I understood was that ASD was part of the differential diagnosis, but they probably went with something like PTSD or CPTSD", "That's...kinda what they said. If they didn't have other trauma, the doctor would have diagnosed them with autism. The other person who replied to you explained it perfectly, I suggest you read it. They just said they almost could have been diagnosed. When I was a kid, my mom said I had enough symptoms for it to be an issue but not enough to be diagnosed. Turns out I got diagnosed as an adult anyway, but that is another example where this wording is correct. \n\n-an adult who is diagnosed with autism", "If you get diagnosed while still developing, it's much more clear-cut. If you have already developed and are exhibiting behaviors that may be due to an undiagnosed developmental disorder, it's hard to distinguish what the root cause of the behavior is. \"Either on the spectrum or not\" is a pretty black-and-white take on something you call a spectrum.", "Mental health dx are **OPINIONS**", "99.9% of them. they are terminally online.", "I think if you want to take on the role of lesson-summariser for people then ok. However be warned that it is seldom welcomed and, I tend to think, mostly unnecessary. I think there's a bigger problem in the world with not allowing space for people to eff up and learn themselves, rather than people not getting it in the ear enough.\n\nBut if they make an apology, what else is there to say? Preaching a bit more, as if you think they aren't sincere, would be a terrible look", "Like, none of them do and then they\u2019re surprised when we don\u2019t have enough seats.", "Is this a thing where people don't count children as human beings? I often have to do surveys with people for my job and for a survey one of the questions was \"how many people live in your household?\" someone once asked me \"are you including children in that?\" I mean why wouldn't I? Aren't children people? Why would you leave out your child in a reservation number? Unless your plan was to have them sit on your lap through the whole meal?", "And as a server, here is an unpopular opinion. This is a nice restaurant and the place is full. There are no more chairs available. And we would prefer to not go find one and put it half out into the aisle because of your poor planning. And the kitchen can handle 99 guests. At 100 we will risk getting behind and everyone will suffer for the rest of the night. Staff and guests alike. Yes, we are here to serve you, but we do not appreciate chairs in the aisle.", "Table for two, a high chair, and a booster. That\u2019s four my friend.", "It's probably got more to do with a lot of psychiatric professionals thinking that autism disappears when you become an adult. For people who have mental health as their job, a lot of shrinks are surprisingly terrible at it", "More like they don't think of children as taking up the same amount of space as an adult.", "Oh yes this. Having a chair where it doesn\u2019t really belong is such a hazard.", "THIS", "Thank you for pointing this out. People make reservations with a specific head count for these and other reasons.", "When I was in med school moving from OBGYN to psychiatry as a specialty it was pretty common for folks to get into med school, see how hard the hours are going to be and drop into an easier specialty in terms of hours, like psychiatry. We were of course in the minority among people who had real problems they were trying to figure out or have family problems they were trying to figure out so they were there because of the life experience they had more than anything else. And of course, for some people it was their calling. \n\nThat's not true of everyone who's interested in psychiatry and or psychology but there's a whole lot of that going on I would say 40 years ago in my experience based on data and observation. So yeah, a lot of people fall into specialties like that because they want to help themselves have a more humane job or deal with things that had never been addressed.\n\nWisely I eventually dropped out. Just for anyone who wanted to know the end of the story."]}
