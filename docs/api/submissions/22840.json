They sound like they can't afford this trip, and the husband has already made your wife uncomfortable. Makes one wonder why he is pushing so hard to invite himself along on this vacation he can't afford. Of course, he will claim you are TA because you squashed whatever weird plans he had.", "Boy oh boy, do I know what you are going through.  I posted about my friend who told me to my face that she was going to use me as her backup atm.  You have to stick to your guns on this one and not give in.\n\nIf your friends are long distance from you, then your flights should not correspond, correct?  You mentioned in the comments that you changed hotels so it seems like half the problem is solved.  Make sure that your other friend that is going isn't goaded into telling your long distance friend any information.  \n\nDon't be afraid to tell them \"no\" when they hang around too long or ask for money.  They had no shame in inviting themselves on your vacation or making your wife uncomfortable, so have no shame in enforcing boundaries.  NTA", "NTA - You missed the warning signs but finally established boundaries. Traveling is an investment of time, money and emotional band width. Protect these.\n\nWhen traveling with others you wants it to be a good time which requires being paired with the right people. They are showing signs this is not the right match. The fact they never asked to travel with you...it was just assumed is a problem and indicates they do not clearly communicate then expect others to fill in their deficits. Best to you.", "NTA - If he made your wife feel uncomfortable, case closed. She shouldn't have to be uncomfortable in her trip. I've had friends like thus before. Wanting to tag along in the hopes that we would buy lunch for them or some other perk. Sound like that might be what they are angling for?", "Hindsight really is 20/20 huh? It sounds like you've got the wisdom of hindsight, but before the actual trip, which is wonderful. \n\nAbsolutely, unequivocally NTA", "NTA.  No one gets to insert themselves into your travel plans without explicitly asking if it\u2019s OK.  I\u2019m sure you have a healthy respect for setting boundaries after this experience, but from everything you mentioned it sounds like you learned something important about these friends before it really became a problem for you.", "No, but kind of ESH.  You enabled this for far too long. You should\u2019ve deaded that shit long before it got to this point.", "NTA. Frankly I'm surprised that Universal is still on the table.", "ESH. The husband sucks for obvious reasons. . .though like, was your wife sharing her insecurities with him, and he was responding to that?\n\nBut like\u2026you, your wife and your friends need to grow a spine and learn to communicate like adults. At no point do you describe setting any clear boundaries, or in any way telling them you didn\u2019t really want them to come on the trip. You basically made it seem like they were welcome while quietly resenting their attempts to, yknow\u2026act like they were welcome guests on the trip.", "NTA\n\nThat is some weird, over reaching, creepy, and entitled behaviour on their part. Definitely put a LOT of distance between yourselves, and these people.", "NTA and honestly I find that couple to be really creepy. The way they never actually asked if they could go, can\u2019t afford it, and make everything your problem really lacks self awareness on their part and also forces you to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d if you call them out on anything. My guess is that the husband is driving force behind all this and is hoping to get with your wife on this trip.", "NTA.
