You have to stick to your guns on this one and not give in.\n\nIf your friends are long distance from you, then your flights should not correspond, correct?  You mentioned in the comments that you changed hotels so it seems like half the problem is solved.  Make sure that your other friend that is going isn't goaded into telling your long distance friend any information.  \n\nDon't be afraid to tell them \"no\" when they hang around too long or ask for money.

Protect these.\n\nWhen traveling with others you wants to have a good time which requires being paired with the right people. They are showing signs this is not the right match. The fact they never asked to travel with you...it was just assumed is a problem and indicates they do not clearly communicate then expect others to fill in their deficits. Best to you.", "NTA - If he made your wife feel uncomfortable, case closed. She shouldn't have to be uncomfortable in her trip. I've had friends like thus before.

It sounds like you've got the wisdom of hindsight, but before the actual trip, which is wonderful. \n\nAbsolutely, unequivocally NTA", "NTA.  No one gets to insert themselves into your travel plans without explicitly asking if it\u2019s OK.  I\u2019m sure you have a healthy respect for setting boundaries after this experience, but from everything you mentioned it sounds like you learned something important about these friends before it really became a problem for you.", "No, but kind of ESH.

The husband sucks for obvious reasons. . .though like, was your wife sharing her insecurities with him, and he was responding to that?\n\nBut like\u2026you, your wife and your friends need to grow a spine and learn to communicate like adults. At no point do you describe setting any clear boundaries, or in any way telling them you didn\u2019t really want them to come on the trip. You basically made it seem like they were welcome while quietly resenting their attempts to, yknow\u2026act like they were welcome guests on the trip.", "NTA\n\nThat is some weird, over reaching, creepy, and entitled behaviour on their part. Definitely put a LOT of distance between yourselves, and these people.", "NTA and honestly I find that couple to be really creepy. The way they never actually asked if they could go, can\u2019t afford it, and make everything your problem really lacks self awareness on their part and also forces you to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d if you call them out on anything.

Soon they'll be asking you and your wife for more, like money and whatnot.

We cut off contact, changed flights and swapped two of the three hotels.", "I see that you rebooked your flights and hotels. I might consider blocking them on your phones so that you don't get irate \"we can't reach you\" messages that might irritate you on your vacation. AND THEN FORGET THEM. Do not give them another thought on your wonderful vacation. Have an amazing time. Eat all the good food, have all the good fun. Because giving people info about a good vacation, and having them invite themselves on it are two totally different thing. The inexcusable bit, the inappropriate flirting with your wife that made her uncomfortable. You never need to see those people again. So happy vacation!", "NTA. In your comments, you've said you've already change flights and hotels. And in your post, you said you 'relented' on universal. You realize you're doing everything possible to avoid these people, right? Last thing is to tell them that Universal is out. You don't seem to want to go. Tell them that.

Is it possible to switch some of your reservations? Once in Japan, block their numbers and do not accept any incoming messages from them. Feed them as much misinformation as possible. \n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that once in Japan, their credit/debit cards will not work if they were maxed even out before the trip. \n\nOffers to hold and hug for a long time would make anyone uncomfortable, coming from someone you are not close to.", "At the very least, don't share your hotel and flight information with someone who is not on your trip or your emergency contact at home.
