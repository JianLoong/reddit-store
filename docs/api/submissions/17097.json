It was too loud, too much going on, too many people. I had to always wait in line for bathrooms to change him. I left after it was clear he wasn\u2019t having fun.\n\nWith that said, it seems like your family could use a vacation. Why not go somewhere like a beach or go camping one weekend? Still take a vacation but save a more expensive vacation like Disney for when the kid is old enough to enjoy it.", "wait a few years so the kid is at least 4 or 5yo before you go. Kid is too young to go on most of the rides at Disney at this age.  And giving you a few years will allow you to save up for the trip you want.\n\nI also dont think you understand how the fast pass thing works though. Some you have to pay for it per ride. So doing it for all the rides is really not affordable. \n\nNAH", "NTA I agree child is too young. But start planning for the trip when they are old enough to enjoy it... plan, save, etc. make it a lifetime deal.", "I personally wouldn't go to Disney with a baby, but I guess it depends on who is expected to have fun and how. I took my kids when the younger one was 4.5 years old and the older one was 8. My goal was to make it a good time for the kids. The 8 year old was perfect. Excited to go. Able to manage the airplane ride. Still has good memories of it.\n\nThe 4.5 year old doesn't remember it, was more effort on the airplane, required renting car seats, we had to work around the times they get tired/want to nap, couldn't go on some of the rides the 8 year old could, etc.\n\nIt costs several thousands of dollars (even with the free lodging we got from a great aunt as a gift). We had fun. Three out of 4 of us have good memories of it.  My younger one instead has good memories of the local ride park 30 minutes from our house that we took her to frequently when she was 8-10 years old. It was much much cheaper.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't consider going to Disney with a baby a 'vacation'. An 'adventure for the adults', maybe. But not relaxing. Even with FastPass, you'll be standing on lines a LOT (which is done differently now using a cell phone app - so you'll need to lug around a battery charger for your phone so it doesn't run out).", "NTA\nYou're right that your son won't remember it or be able to enjoy it to the full extent and waiting in lines is bad even without a baby. \nI would say start saving specifically for a Disney trip now and have a blast when your kid is old enough to enjoy it and you can get the passes to make the most of it", "NTA for not wanting to endure Disneyland with an 11 month old. Lines and costs are a no-go for me. \n\nAlternative suggestion for a great time with your family would be Knotts Berry Farm. More laid back, fun time and a lot less $$. https://thepointsguy.com/guide/knotts-berry-farm/", "NTA.  \n\nTaking an 11 month old to Disneyland is a complete waste of money.   It makes zero sense.     Go on vacation, but go on vacation to somewhere that will actually enjoyable for everyone, including your baby.", "NTA. \n\nI LOVE Disneyland & would always advocate going, but IMO it\u2019s a waste of time and money to go with a child under the age of 5. Save the money to take an epic trip when your kid can actually enjoy & possibly remember. Disneyland ain\u2019t going no where. Plus too many referbs right now at the park to make it worth your wild if you want to go soon.", "NTA. You don't have a lot of spare cash, and your son won't remember any of it. Plus, it sounds like a nightmare day with a young baby. I'd save it for when he's older and will actually enjoy it.", "NTA.  Your 11 month old will not remember a thing AND won\u2019t be able to go on most of the attractions.   Disney is way too expensive and crowded/noisy.", "So, I agree with you that the baby may not care at all about Disney, but I also kinda feel like you wouldn't be thrilled with any vacation since you keep saying you're frugal, but not that you are struggling financially. Like that's way more what stands out", "NTA.  You're right, it's pointless to bring an infant there, you'll just be making the trip worse for yourselves and any strangers who have to listen to the kid cry in line.  There is absolutely zero benefit to the baby.  \n\nIt's also very reasonable to want the fast pass, because as you said, spending more time in line than actually doing stuff is lame.\n\nTake a cheaper vacation somewhere else right now, and save up for a Disney trip when kiddo is old enough to enjoy it.", "We took our 11 month old to Walt Disney World because I was attending a conference and wanted my wife to join me.  We had fun but our daughter spent most the time sleeping in a stroller and does not remember anything.  We took her back when she was 4 (this time my wife was attending a conference) and that\u2019s what our daughter remembers as her \u201cfirst\u201d visit.  A better vacation for a toddler would include ducks she can feed and hay bales she can climb on.  NTA", "NTA. It's not that much extra ($25) each for Disney Genie+ which includes not only lightning lanes (what they call fast passes now), but also free photos--on the rides that have them, and also with characters around the park. Then you would have lots of photo memories to share with your son when he's older. If you're already spending hundreds of dollars to go there, it makes sense to spend an extra $75 for those perks and shorter lines. \n\nThere are other ways to be frugal--you can bring in food and drinks, instead of paying their outrageous prices. They inspect your bags, but we always have snacks and drinks and they never say anything. And there are inexpensive hotels to stay at right near the park.", "Listen to this - go right, I\u2019m talking right before he turns 3 years old, like just shy of a few days. His tickets are FREE and he\u2019s gonna be a little older and can recognize the characters and all that jazz. \n\nThen get the genie plus because yea who wants to stand in lines when they don\u2019t have to. \n\nEnjoy!\n\nAlso on Facebook there are CRAPTON of groups dedicated to this stuff, doing Disney on the cheap. Join those groups and you are gonna find a LOT of people like you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. A vacation is a good idea but Disney is wasted on an 11 month old. I don't remember any of my visits before 7 or so.", "NTA however, At this age the trip is not for the baby but think about how fun it would be to show your little all the rides in Disney especially in fantasyland while you\u2019re snacking on a corn dog. Do some research! There\u2019s ways not to make it miserable.", "NTA- I think you guys should consider dollywood. I've never been but I am under the impression that it might be a little easier with a baby. If your dad is in good health, wait til your son is a little older. But, you never know if his health will hold up. Would be sad to never get that opportunity. You could apply for a credit card that has travel deals. That could make getting the pass cheaper and easier to pay off over a long period of time.", "Why don\u2019t you stay home with the baby and let them two go?", "NTA. Saving up for the vacation you want (ie the fastpasses) is better than spending the little funds you have on a vacation that won't meet your expectations but will still cost you a significant amount of your limited budget. You're also entirely right about kid being too young to get the full disneyland experience imo. Going to Disneyland when I was ~5 years old was one of the best memories of my childhood, whereas my sister who was ~2 has limited memories, if any. If you can only afford to go on a vacation in rare occasions I would strongly recommend waiting until your son is older, but ultimately it needs to be a joint decision between you and your wife. Talk it out - a situation where one of you feels like they were forced to compromise (either you feeling like you're being forced to spend your budget on a trip you didn't want, or your gf feeling like you don't trust her autonomy to have a say on how you guys spend your money) helps no one. \n\nAlso, as an aside, I would make sure that you have a sufficient emergency fund stowed away before going on *any* vacation. You owe it to your son to put the health and safety of your family above any trip. My apologies if you've already taken this into account and this comment is unnecessary to your situation, but I knew a family that had a medical incident right after going on a lavish vacation so this strikes close to home for me.", "NTA Disneyland can get pretty expensive if you\u2019re not taking your own food and drinks on top of your ticket prices. You\u2019re totally right your child is too young right now to remember anything. The other issue you will have is your son is going to be too small for the adult rides so you\u2019ll always only have 2 of you riding whilst the other waits with your son. You do see families with younger children at Disney but they seem to be annual pass holders. Being in Disney can be a long and exhausting day if you want to see and do everything and I honestly wouldn\u2019t do it with an 11 month old.", "If you want to go, wait til the child is old enough to remember it.   It's pointless to go when he's that young.", "NAH. Just keep negotiating", "NTA.  \"Frugal\" and \"Disney\" don't go in the same sentence, especially with a kid that will only ever know they went if you show them pictures.  If you're going to go, at least pay for the experience you want.", "YTA. Go to Disneyland.  You book ride entry lines online while in the park.It\u2019s all different now.  You can even order\nfood like that so no food lines either.  Baby will enjoy the outing & your wife wants to go.  With her baby.  If I were her I\u2019d take my kid & dad & go.  The pics last a lifetime & your kid will love knowing that you took him.", "NTA your points are all valid. Save up and go when your son is older. He\u2019ll be more likely to remember and he\u2019ll be able to go on most of the rides. Also, the pass system has changed but if you wait and save it won\u2019t be a problem to get whatever the parks have when you go.", "NTA. Disney is for kids 10 and up, and without a fast pass, there\u2019s not much point.", "Disneyland is so expensive!  The child is really too young to enjoy it and will not remember a thing. You're better off taking him to Adventureland if you live in the area.   If she really needs to visit a theme park, Legoland is better. IMO, DL is not the better place on earth, especially with a baby!  NTA.", "NTA, see if you\u2019re wife will settle for a trip to the Grand Canyon or Roswell NM or something cheaper for now, with the promise of putting away money so you can take your son to Disney when he\u2019s old enough to enjoy it.", "NTA, we live fairly close to DW and waited until our kid was 5 before we took him.  It was a little rough with lines and such, but not too bad. Just a long day for a little body.\n\nI had a work thing and got free tickets to Sea World at 3... it was horrible. Not interested or tall enough for most of it. Doesn't remember it. Just overall a rough day for not much fun.\n\nI have friends who take their little kids as passholders, but they don't spend all day in the park and it's very much for the parents to enjoy rather than the kids.  So, it can be done, but I wouldn't do it for the kid's benefit until at least 5.  Find a national park to sightsee, an aquarium, but unless your wife really wanted to go for her, NTA.  If she did, she needs to communicate that better, and possibly make it a date thing vs a family thing.", "NAH. If Disneyland is a \u201cstretch\u201d for your financial situation, then not going yet is reasonable.\n\nBUT\u2026 although your kid won\u2019t remember Disneyland, you will remember your kid at Disneyland. I took my daughter to Walt Disney World at 18 months and though she doesn\u2019t remember it now (at age 12), I have wonderful memories (and photos and videos) of her joy.", "NTA. Honestly taking a baby to Disneyland doesn\u2019t sound like a good idea. Especially if you live on a budget. He won\u2019t know what\u2019s happening and won\u2019t remember anything. Also he\u2019ll prevent you from enjoying yourselves cause one of you will have to stay with him.", "I didn't know what the tower of terror was. They strap you in and you go on a ride through a building with ghosts. It was terrifying. The ghosts were amazing. 3d projections. Then they raise you UP UP UP and then they open the door and you can see that your suspended at the top of the building. Then, They DROP you. \n\nMy sister tried to talk me into doing it twice. It was one of the best/worst experiences at Disney. I only regret I didn't go with her to do it twice. But I'll never forget.\n\nDon't assume. Give your kiddo the chance.", "NTA \nyou're right in thinking you have to splurge and buy the quick pass. the waiting times are hours long otherwise. best to go in 5 or 6 years when your kid will REALLY enjoy it.", "NTA\n\nDisney is a HUGE expense for a baby who will never remember the trip. Going on holiday somewhere and making memories is a good idea", "11 month old does not need Disney land or will not enjoy it.\nThat being said you totally can go without fast pass with some preparations. Especially since it seems like you will be in tough spot to afford it.\n\nNot going on any vacation seems like  a bad compromise.", "NTA but.....it feels close. I agree that Disney is highway-robbery in terms of a vacation. I bet there's other local AND national amusement parks that are way more affordable for the budget. But, from the tone of this post, I feel like any money towards a vacation will be a problem to you, and even buying the fast-pass will just be another strike against the trip. Disney is easy to use that on, so see if there are super affordable vacations locally or even regionally!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ideally your child needs to be old enough to walk on their own most of the day and remember things. 7-10 is a good range. You are a jerk for not ever going on vacation. Go camping. Take a trip to the beach. Have some fun. Doesn't have to be expensive. Just different.", "I live near Disneyland and so I have been there a lot of times with various aged people.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to bring an infant to Disneyland - not only will they not enjoy it but it will also make the experience worse for the adults because there are many rides you wouldn't be able to do with an infant. Not to mention that no infant deserves to be hauled around for an extended period of time in the heat and sun and noise.\n\nEven three is really young and a waste for most kids. My brother was desperate to take his daughter at that age and I tagged along. She was actively frightened by the characters because at that developmental age they have no ability to distinguish real from fantasy and she was too young to feel 'affection\" for the Disney characters. I didn't mind staying behind so he could do Space Mountain and the other adult rides and I hung out with my niece.\n\nDo something cheap as a family outing - surely there must be a beach or lake or kiddy friendly experience that you all can share memories of.\n\nWhen your daughter really can anticipate going to Disneyland you can take her and the splurge would be worth the money.\n\nFWIW before going to Disney - especially for the first time - go to the forums of Disney experts as they will be able to provide you with the most up to date information to maximize your experience - what is worth it - how to see as much as possible etc.", "Wait until this little guy is 4 or 5... anything before that is a waste.", "From what I recall from my trip last August, you could either buy individual Lightning Lane passes for rides, or pay $20 extra for your ticket to have Genie+, which was let you do Lightning Lane for pretty much any ride that allowed it once per day. The only drawback to Genie+ is that it doesn't do any good for rides with no Lightning Lane (Pirates of the Caribbean, for instance, flat out can't put one in without a dramatic overhaul that would affect much of New Orleans Square), and Star Wars: Rise of the Resistane not being part of Genie+ despite having a Lightning Lane (it's also the **only** ride in the park that's actually worth paying for separately, and I say that having had to come back later in the day with a refunded pass because it broke down just as I was about to board).", "Granted - I didn\u2019t research that part of my argument.
