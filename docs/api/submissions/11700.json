She started texting my mother when she and Todd would disagree, asking my mother her opinion or if she could talk to Todd on her behalf. My mother was very uncomfortable with this. My mother was happy to help out with anything to do with adjusting to living in a different country, but she really didn't want to get involved in Hayley and Todd's relationship. \n\nThen Hayley started texting me. She would get in a disagreement with Todd and text me the next day asking me to come to her house to talk about it, or ask me for advice. I said was not getting involved in my brother's marriage and that it was inappropriate, but that didn't stop her. She started showing up at my mother's house unannounced and even tried to once at my apartment. We've all separately spoken to Todd about this many times and he's said he will talk to her about it but nothing ever changes.\n\nA few days ago I got a call from Hayley. She was screaming and sobbing so loudly my sales assistant could hear her even though she wasn't on loudspeaker. What I ended up being able to understand was that Todd about money and he had changed his credit card details and she was upset. She wanted me to talk to him but I told her I was not getting involved in this and I was sick of her trying to drag me into her marriage. I told her that from now on any messages or information shared with me would be passed along to Todd because I was done and hung up. She tried to call back but I didn't pick up. Then a barrage of texts start coming through. I forwarded them all to Todd and told him this stuff needs to stay on his plate not ours and we're sick of her behaviour. Todd apologised and said he'd do something about it.\n\nThat evening, I got a long text from Hayley saying she can't believe I forwarded her messages to Todd and that I betrayed her confidence and that I was a terrible person for never helping her with anything. I just forwarded the message to Todd. Since then I haven't heard from her and neither has my mother.\n\nI was at lunch with my friends yesterday, all of whom know about the background to this, and they all said that while I definitely should have made sure Todd handled it, I probably shouldn't have forwarded him the messages immediately and that I did betray Hayley's trust. I don't think I did, considering I warned her what I would do if she didn't stop.

Hayley sounds really tiring and annoying. Whinging about your husband to his mother and sister when you don't have a close relationship with them is not going to make you closer. Ignoring the boundaries your SIL sets when she says not to text her about these things isn't going to get her on your side either. Your SIL is very naive and weird, and disrespecting of other people's boundaries. I'm not surprised she hasn't made any friends in Switzerland yet if this is how she acts.", "NTA \n\nI think you handled this correctly but I also think Todd needs to figure this out with Hayley quickly. It sounds like she has no one to talk to and she is living in a foreign country. Desperate people can do desperate things. It would not be crazy to think she might flee back to her family in the States with your nephew. I\u2019m not an attorney but an American woman returning to the States with her son from a father also born in America might make things pretty tricky for your brother if she is this miserable. You for sure shouldn\u2019t be in the middle because marriage shit always goes sideways but I\u2019d be nervous if I were Todd and my wife was acting out like this with a baby.", "NTA, how can you betray her trust when you didn\u2019t ask to know about their troubles? She\u2019s forcing this information onto you.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA. I find it interesting that she has found the people in Switzerland cold because that\u2019s how your post comes across. \n\nA) Hayley has moved across the world to live with her husband and his family. She has no friends or family there and is not working. \nB) Hayley has recently given birth. Since having a baby her relationship has been having issues. One of the issues mentioned in your post is the possibility of financial control. ie credit card details have been changed potentially leaving Hayley with no access to funds. \nC) the only female contacts she has in-country have dismissed her concerns and made it clear that not only will they not help her they will share disclosed information with her husband. \n\nThis isn\u2019t just family loyalties. Your apathy is alarming. While your brother may or may not be abusing his wife - no one really knows because you don\u2019t seem to have considered the possibility- it is clear that Hailey needs help that she is not getting from her husband, her MIL or you. Even helping her get access to mental health services would be beneficial.", "Technically NTA but seems like Hayley can use a friend and some compassion. She moved to a brand new country and had a baby less than a year ago. Her friends and family are all likely on a different continent on a different time zone. This probably hasn\u2019t been the easiest adjustment for her, and then add postpartum hormones\u2026 sounds like she really needs a friend.", "Right first things first does Hayley have any support in Switzerland apart from your family, any girlfriends etc. If not then at first she was sounding off to the only female support she has here you and your mother. I agree she's wrong to try and get you to influence your brother but she's also not wrong to seek out a sounding board. It would have been NTA if you had just stuck to your guns and said you are staying out of it but by forwarding the texts you've now involved yourself in the argument.

If he is being an ah, then maybe you could ask him what's going on, i.e., get both sides, but not directly put yourself in the middle.\n\nIt sounds like she's struggling and needs help and feels isolated though, maybe you could give her some time \u2013 again without putting yourself directly in the middle.\n\nIt seems no-ones the AH in this situation or maybe everyone is. I can't tell which with the limited information.\n\nI think you need to set clear boundaries, yes, but I think you should also make her feel welcome & accepted.", "NTA.  The only way for her to fix an issue with her husband is to talk to him directly.  I often vent to a friend when I'm upset, just to talk it out, but then I have to go talk to the actual person to fix the problem.\nIf this is new behaviour for her, she could have PPD.  She may need to talk to her doctor", "NTA. Bro she is sobbing and screaming because your brother changed his credit card info? Thats just stupid as hell", "NTA, Hayley can call her friends, family if she needs to vent.  Pulling you and your mom into their fights is ridiculous.  Does she expect you 2 to take her side.  I think she is being manipulative and a drama queen.", "NTA. She effed around and found out. She was warned.", "NTA. Honestly, she sounds manipulative. If she wanted to go for a coffee and talk life in general, including her hardships of being a new mom, in a different country, away from her support system, that would be totally normal. But from the sound of it, she just wants to push her husband to do certain things or act a certain way and goes around trying to find ways for him to cave in to her wishes. That is toxic AF. Not only that, but she has been told numerous times by both yourself and your mom to stop involving you in their quarrels, and she continues to do it. She has been told what the boundaries are, but she doesn't care. If she were texting you that she's in trouble, it would be different, but she doesn't seem to be doing that. You explicitly told her what you want/don't want and what will happen if she doesn't respect your boundary. You didn't betray any trust, you followed through on what you said you would do. You weren't a jerk or an AH, you acted perfectly normal.", "NTA she sounds like she\u2019s 13 not 31!! She needs to learn how to be in adult relationship. \n\nPretty worried that your home other chose to have a child with her. I would be pretty worried that she would use the child in a similar way and manipulate them both. Yikes.", "Info: how long has she lived there now?", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't betray anyone's trust, because first you were honest that you were going to share messages and more importantly, no one gets to demand your trust. \n\nFor example, if my friend's boyfriend tells me he is cheating on her, that's his problem and I can tell who I want. This dude doesn't get my trust just because he wants it. I can't just tell people stuff and then get mad if they share it, trust is built, earned and is a two way street. \n\nYou also have a duty of trust with your brother, and typically that would mean you owe him more than you owe his wife. She needs to tell her own people stuff she doesn't want him to know, because you are going to choose him every time. \n\nAnd finally, it is super weird that she thinks she can just demand you all do what she wants and really unhealthy that she wants to involve all these outsiders in her marriage. My guess is your brother is really rethinking his relationship, so now is the time to show up and support him and ask him what help he needs.", "NTA- you told her you were going to send him her texts. She sent them anyway. She was told not to involve you in her marital issues. She did anyway. I understand she may be feeling isolated as she is in a strange country and doesn\u2019t have any family or friends around. She needs a marriage therapist, not to dump this all on Todd\u2019s family. Of course they are going to take his side.", "NTA, Haley needs professional help by the sounds of it.", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing with Haley to instill any kind of trust that you could betray.\n\nIf the person your brother promised to spend his life with is using you as a tool in an argument, he needs to know.", "NTA, Block her \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f or tell Hayley to find a therapist", ">  I told her that from now on any messages or information shared with me would be passed along to Todd because I was done and hung up. \n\nWhat was the goal in this?

I totally get not wanting to hear all their disagreements, especially bc it's your brother. But having said that, it seems like she really needs a friend. Is there a way you could maybe take her out for a coffee or ice cream, and tell her you care about both her and your brother, but you don't want to be the mediator in their relationship? Taking her out for a little time could help her recognize that it's not her you're rejecting, and help her not feel so alone in her new country.", "While sure getting married to your brother doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obliged to talk to her, I\u2019m going to say YTA. She has no family, no fiends, no job, has recently given birth, and the two females that should be like family to her now want nothing to do with her. \n\nAs other people have pointed out, she could be experiencing types of abuse in her relationship, but you haven\u2019t bothered to listen enough to know. If she\u2019s reaching out there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s because only you or his mother can do something to help change whatever the behavior is if it\u2019s an issue. It might also be a cultural divide on how relationships work in Switzerland as opposed to here. It makes you sound like a shit person that a potential abuse victim is reaching out for help and not only are you ignoring her but you\u2019re forwarding her messages to her potential abuser. \n\nAt least listen to what she\u2019s saying before you decide that it\u2019s petty of her to reach out, you might be the only support she has to turn to, being in a new country and all.", "YTA by making things intentionally worse. \n\nIf Hailey is trying to get other people to intercede on her behalf either she is manipulative or she\u2019s desperate because Todd is a crap husband who doesn\u2019t respect her. \n\nYour family needs to have an intervention with Todd and Hailey and insist on couples counseling or help them find divorce lawyers.", "YTA - you betrayed her confidence.

Is there any chance your SIL is being purposely isolated and financially (or otherwise) abused?", "NTA. I can understand why you're feeling conflicted about the situation with your brother and his wife. It's tough to navigate family dynamics, especially when someone is trying to involve you in their marriage problems. It sounds like you've tried to set boundaries with Hayley multiple times, but she hasn't respected them.  \nIn this case, I don't think you were in the wrong for forwarding Hayley's messages to your brother. You had warned her that you were done getting involved in their relationship and that any messages would be passed along to Todd. It's not fair for her to continue to involve you and your mother when you've made it clear you don't want to be involved.  \nIt's understandable that Hayley is upset, but ultimately, it's up to Todd to handle the situation with her.

You are definitely correct on that. But\u2026Maybe she just needs a hand. Before this mess she made, did anyone reach out to see how she was doing when she wasn\u2019t being dramatic? \n\nSomeone that wants to know who she is and how she\u2019s feeling might be what she needs.

Todd takes after my dad in being the most conflict averse, mellow person around. I don't think I've heard him raise is voice in the last 15 years. I can be a pretty confrontational person and in my experience, while he'll argue his point, he's almost annoyingly hard to provoke. \n\nSo again, I won't say for sure because you shouldn't ever say 100% because then you miss signs, but nothing I know about him would indicate that he is.", ">Info: I know it might not be nice to think like this, but is there any chance Todd is being abusive behind closed doors?\n\n[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Just\\_asking\\_questions](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Just_asking_questions)", "She is now, but she is planning to get a job when Josh is around 18mo.", "Thank you for the being the first comment to be concerned OPs brother is abusive and she\u2019s looking for the only help she can get.

She\u2019s in another country and not working so she has none of her own money and you said he cut off her access to it. That sounds shady as hell to me. That sounds like financial abuse. I control the money, so I control you.\n\nThere were a handful of times I found out my brother said some awful stuff to his ex. His father severely abused our mother and part of that was mental and emotional abuse. You can bet your ass when I found out he was heading down that path that I got involved.

We had several one on one talks about the way he was treating her. And he took those talks to heart, really listened to what I said and realized he was being hurtful and went to therapy. It wasn\u2019t in time to save his marriage but he was able to work on those things and they now are able to co-parent and get along with each other without being hurtful.\n\nThe reverse has also been true and my brother has come to me about my issues I\u2019ve had and called me out on it.

Hayley has her own cards, and her own savings. Even if Todd refused to pay for anything (which I would ever expect that he did), I think he'd have a very hard time confiscating money she had from before she even met him. I have no reason to think he's done any of that. He explained he didn't even change his details, Hayley attempted to make a large purchase and his bank blocked the card because it got flagged as suspicious. Is Todd always right? No, of course not.
