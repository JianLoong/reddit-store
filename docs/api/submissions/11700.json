My family moved in Switzerland when we were young, but Todd when back to the US for college which is where he met Hayley, and they've since moved back to Switzerland when Hayley got pregnant.\n\nSince Hayley and Todd got married, and especially since she gave birth, Hayley has been trying to involve my mother and me in her and Todd's relationship. She started texting my mother when she and Todd would disagree, asking my mother her opinion or if she could talk to Todd on her behalf. My mother was very uncomfortable with this. My mother was happy to help out with anything to do with adjusting to living in a different country, but she really didn't want to get involved in Hayley and Todd's relationship. \n\nThen Hayley started texting me. She would get in a disagreement with Todd and text me the next day asking me to come to her house to talk about it, or ask me for advice. I said was not getting involved in my brother's marriage and that it was inappropriate, but that didn't stop her. She started showing up at my mother's house unannounced and even tried to once at my apartment. We've all separately spoken to Todd about this many times and he's said he will talk to her about it but nothing ever changes.\n\nA few days ago I got a call from Hayley. She was screaming and sobbing so loudly my sales assistant could hear her even though she wasn't on loudspeaker. What I ended up being able to understand was that Todd about money and he had changed his credit card details and she was upset. She wanted me to talk to him but I told her I was not getting involved in this and I was sick of her trying to drag me into her marriage. I told her that from now on any messages or information shared with me would be passed along to Todd because I was done and hung up. She tried to call back but I didn't pick up. Then a barrage of texts start coming through. I forwarded them all to Todd and told him this stuff needs to stay on his plate not ours and we're sick of her behaviour. Todd apologised and said he'd do something about it.\n\nThat evening, I got a long text from Hayley saying she can't believe I forwarded her messages to Todd and that I betrayed her confidence and that I was a terrible person for never helping her with anything. I just forwarded the message to Todd. Since then I haven't heard from her and neither has my mother.\n\nI was at lunch with my friends yesterday, all of whom know about the background to this, and they all said that while I definitely should have made sure Todd handled it, I probably shouldn't have forwarded him the messages immediately and that I did betray Hayley's trust. I don't think I did, considering I warned her what I would do if she didn't stop. I've also been speaking to Todd and this has caused mayhem in their household, so now I'm feeling bad because that wasn't my intention. AITA?\n\nEDIT: re the credit card information and the comments about Todd, he did not change his credit card information. Hayley attempted to make a large purchase on his card that flagged as suspicious and the card was blocked. Todd has never restricted Hayley\u2019s access to money, particularly as Hayley has her own cards and savings in her own accounts. Nothing Hayley has ever said about Todd make us think there\u2019s anything more serious going on, and I\u2019ve seen with my own eyes a copy of the statement, I know what the charge was for, it was a large personal purchase, nothing that was a necessity for Hayley or the baby.", "created_utc": 1678193545, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kykbl/aita_for_forwarding_my_brother_his_wifes_texts/", "score": 6643, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hayley sounds really tiring and annoying. Whinging about your husband to his mother and sister when you don't have a close relationship with them is not going to make you closer. Ignoring the boundaries your SIL sets when she says not to text her about these things isn't going to get her on your side either. Your SIL is very naive and weird, and disrespecting of other people's boundaries. I'm not surprised she hasn't made any friends in Switzerland yet if this is how she acts.", "NTA \n\nI think you handled this correctly but I also think Todd needs to figure this out with Hayley quickly. It sounds like she has no one to talk to and she is living in a foreign country. Desperate people can do desperate things. It would not be crazy to think she might flee back to her family in the States with your nephew. I\u2019m not an attorney but an American woman returning to the States with her son from a father also born in America might make things pretty tricky for your brother if she is this miserable. You for sure shouldn\u2019t be in the middle because marriage shit always goes sideways but I\u2019d be nervous if I were Todd and my wife was acting out like this with a baby.", "NTA, how can you betray her trust when you didn\u2019t ask to know about their troubles? She\u2019s forcing this information onto you.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA. I find it interesting that she has found the people in Switzerland cold because that\u2019s how your post comes across. \n\nA) Hayley has moved across the world to live with her husband and his family. She has no friends or family there and is not working. \nB) Hayley has recently given birth. Since having a baby her relationship has been having issues. One of the issues mentioned in your post is the possibility of financial control. ie credit card details have been changed potentially leaving Hayley with no access to funds. \nC) the only female contacts she has in-country have dismissed her concerns and made it clear that not only will they not help her they will share disclosed information with her husband. \n\nThis isn\u2019t just family loyalties. Your apathy is alarming. While your brother may or may not be abusing his wife - no one really knows because you don\u2019t seem to have considered the possibility- it is clear that Hailey needs help that she is not getting from her husband, her MIL or you. Even helping her get access to mental health services would be beneficial.", "Technically NTA but seems like Hayley can use a friend and some compassion. She moved to a brand new country and had a baby less than a year ago. Her friends and family are all likely on a different continent on a different time zone. This probably hasn\u2019t been the easiest adjustment for her, and then add postpartum hormones\u2026 sounds like she really needs a friend.", "Right first things first does Hayley have any support in Switzerland apart from your family, any girlfriends etc. If not then at first she was sounding off to the only female support she has here you and your mother. I agree she's wrong to try and get you to influence your brother but she's also not wrong to seek out a sounding board. It would have been NTA if you had just stuck to your guns and said you are staying out of it but by forwarding the texts you've now involved yourself in the argument.

If he is being an ah, then maybe you could ask him what's going on, i.e., get both sides, but not directly put yourself in the middle.\n\nIt sounds like she's struggling and needs help and feels isolated though, maybe you could give her some time \u2013 again without putting yourself directly in the middle.\n\nIt seems no-ones the AH in this situation or maybe everyone is. I can't tell which with the limited information.\n\nI think you need to set clear boundaries, yes, but I think you should also make her feel welcome & accepted.", "NTA.  The only way for her to fix an issue with her husband is to talk to him directly.  I often vent to a friend when I'm upset, just to talk it out, but then I have to go talk to the actual person to fix the problem.\nIf this is new behaviour for her, she could have PPD.  She may need to talk to her doctor", "NTA. Bro she is sobbing and screaming because your brother changed his credit card info? Thats just stupid as hell", "NTA, Hayley can call her friends, family if she needs to vent.  Pulling you and your mom into their fights is ridiculous.  Does she expect you 2 to take her side.  I think she is being manipulative and a drama queen.", "NTA. She effed around and found out. She was warned.", "NTA. Honestly, she sounds manipulative. If she wanted to go for a coffee and talk life in general, including her hardships of being a new mom, in a different country, away from her support system, that would be totally normal. But from the sound of it, she just wants to push her husband to do certain things or act a certain way and goes around trying to find ways for him to cave in to her wishes. That is toxic AF. Not only that, but she has been told numerous times by both yourself and your mom to stop involving you in their quarrels, and she continues to do it. She has been told what the boundaries are, but she doesn't care. If she were texting you that she's in trouble, it would be different, but she doesn't seem to be doing that. You explicitly told her what you want/don't want and what will happen if she doesn't respect your boundary. You didn't betray any trust, you followed through on what you said you would do. You weren't a jerk or an AH, you acted perfectly normal.", "NTA she sounds like she\u2019s 13 not 31!! She needs to learn how to be in adult relationship. \n\nPretty worried that your home other chose to have a child with her. I would be pretty worried that she would use the child in a similar way and manipulate them both. Yikes.", "Info: how long has she lived there now?", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't betray anyone's trust, because first you were honest that you were going to share messages and more importantly, no one gets to demand your trust. \n\nFor example, if my friend's boyfriend tells me he is cheating on her, that's his problem and I can tell who I want. This dude doesn't get my trust just because he wants it. I can't just tell people stuff and then get mad if they share it, trust is built, earned and is a two way street. \n\nYou also have a duty of trust with your brother, and typically that would mean you owe him more than you owe his wife. She needs to tell her own people stuff she doesn't want him to know, because you are going to choose him every time. \n\nAnd finally, it is super weird that she thinks she can just demand you all do what she wants and really unhealthy that she wants to involve all these outsiders in her marriage. My guess is your brother is really rethinking his relationship, so now is the time to show up and support him and ask him what help he needs.", "NTA- you told her you were going to send him her texts. She sent them anyway. She was told not to involve you in her marital issues. She did anyway. I understand she may be feeling isolated as she is in a strange country and doesn\u2019t have any family or friends around. She needs a marriage therapist, not to dump this all on Todd\u2019s family.

I totally get not wanting to hear all their disagreements, especially bc it's your brother. But having said that, it seems like she really needs a friend. Is there a way you could maybe take her out for a coffee or ice cream, and tell her you care about both her and your brother, but you don't want to be the mediator in their relationship? Taking her out for a little time could help her recognize that it's not her you're rejecting, and help her not feel so alone in her new country.", "While sure getting married to your brother doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obliged to talk to her, I\u2019m going to say YTA. She has no family, no fiends, no job, has recently given birth, and the two females that should be like family to her now want nothing to do with her. \n\nAs other people have pointed out, she could be experiencing types of abuse in her relationship, but you haven\u2019t bothered to listen enough to know. If she\u2019s reaching out there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s because only you or his mother can do something to help change whatever the behavior is if it\u2019s an issue. It might also be a cultural divide on how relationships work in Switzerland as opposed to here. It makes you sound like a shit person that a potential abuse victim is reaching out for help and not only are you ignoring her but you\u2019re forwarding her messages to her potential abuser. \n\nAt least listen to what she\u2019s saying before you decide that it\u2019s petty of her to reach out, you might be the only support she has to turn to, being in a new country and all.", "YTA by making things intentionally worse. \n\nIf Hailey is trying to get other people to intercede on her behalf either she is manipulative or she\u2019s desperate because Todd is a crap husband who doesn\u2019t respect her. \n\nYour family needs to have an intervention with Todd and Hailey and insist on couples counseling or help them find divorce lawyers.", "YTA - you betrayed her confidence.

Is there any chance your SIL is being purposely isolated and financially (or otherwise) abused?", "NTA. I can understand why you're feeling conflicted about the situation with your brother and his wife. It's tough to navigate family dynamics, especially when someone is trying to involve you in their marriage problems. It sounds like you've tried to set boundaries with Hayley multiple times, but she hasn't respected them.  \nIn this case, I don't think you were in the wrong for forwarding Hayley's messages to your brother. You had warned her that you were done getting involved in their relationship and that any messages would be passed along to Todd. It's not fair for her to continue to involve you and your mother when you've made it clear you don't want to be involved.  \nIt's understandable that Hayley is upset, but ultimately, it's up to Todd to handle the situation with her.

You are definitely correct on that. But\u2026Maybe she just needs a hand. Before this mess she made, did anyone reach out to see how she was doing when she wasn\u2019t being dramatic? \n\nSomeone that wants to know who she is and how she\u2019s feeling might be what she needs.

She may be having a hard time but she clearly loves him too.\n\nI am an American who lived in CH for a while, not saying I have any magical insight because of that but here are my general thoughts on why she might be in a rough state:\n\n* It takes a long time to make friends in CH as an adult. Most of the adults I met already had a core friend group that they have known since childhood and that is tough to integrate into, even if there are no language barriers. It can take literal years to make a real friend when you show up out of the blue.\n* She may miss the \u201cfriendly-acquaintances\u201c level of connection that is much more common in the U.S. I\u2019ve seen it described with a fruit metaphor: the Swiss are like coconuts, there\u2019s a tough shell to get through before you get to the good stuff. Americans are like peaches, they have a soft outer layer but a hard core. You don\u2019t get to the core friendship stage without engaging in the soft stuff first, but just because you have the soft stuff doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in the core group. Right now, she has no peaches and hasn\u2019t gotten through any coconut shells yet either.\n*  I enjoyed the book Swiss Watching, have you read it? It\u2019s lighthearted and snarky fun but made the process of moving to CH a little easier. It definitely made me feel less alone in my frustrations with the fremdenpolizei and other aspects of living in CH as a foreigner. The fruit metaphor might be from there, I can\u2019t remember. It\u2019s, um, not the gospel or final word on Swiss culture by any means (in many ways it says more about the Brits than the Swiss) but seriously I think your SIL might like something like that. She\u2019s going to be in your life for a while, so this might be a good peace offering once you\u2019re all ready for that (as in, she gets her behavior in order and you\u2019re feeling ready to move on).\n\nI\u2018m not saying this to tell you what to do or how to feel, just so that you have some extra background on how isolating it really feels to move to CH as an American adult. I had a lonely time there, even though I had a job and everyone was super nice about my language acquisition (I tried, but ich lerne langsam, apparently). I even already had friends in the country and it was still an adjustment. By the time the Swiss people I met were comfortable enough with me to invite me to their homes, I was already burnt out and checked out (because of the job too, not just isolation). Add in having a baby and it\u2018s going to be really hard.\n\nYou seem baffled why she would even consider reaching out to you about her fights with your brother. The most charitable interpretation is that she may want to talk to you precisely because she knows you love him and are on his side. If she vents to friend or family who don\u2019t know him, then those friends and family might start to dislike him and not actually support the relationship. Given that you said she\u2019s been saying shitty things about your brother, though, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any way the asshole to shut this down without that benefit of the doubt. That\u2019s the only reason I might consider her an asshole but without specifics and given everything else, it\u2019s hard to parse that out from her flailing around in pain.\n\nI\u2019m just writing this comment in the hopes that (once she has her shit together and is willing to respect your boundaries) you can find the bandwidth for enough empathy to make your future relationship with your SIL more mutually fulfilling. She\u2019s put you in a tough spot, I hope it can work out.", "Absolutely NTA for not wanting to be involved in their arguments- but maybe show some compassion.

If Hayley didn\u2019t know she was moving to a country that is \u201ccolder\u201d*, that\u2019s on her.

I\u2019m not seeing where OP & her family are withholding support in other areas, *they just don\u2019t want to be involved in their marriage, and that\u2019s ok*. This is a common boundary in families in the US so it shouldn\u2019t be a complete surprise to Hayley that some families don\u2019t get involved like she wants the OP\u2019s family to be involved. Though tbh, it sounds like Hayley is just very loose with boundaries in general (per one of OP\u2019s comments) and it\u2019s going to be painful for her to learn new ways of interacting.

How is OP supposed to be friends with Hayley if Hayley can\u2019t abide by a simple boundary?

I can only imagine how your brother feels about his wife just blurting out all their marriage/relationship problems to people... it is humiliating and inappropriate! After you forwarded the texts, it put her back in her place! I don't think you betrayed her trust if you did not want to be involved in the first place! \n\nYou warned her what would happen, and you put your foot down! Not the a-hole!

It sounds like Hayley is trying to get you and your mom to be mediators between her and your brother, and take her side against him, not that she's trying to become friends with you. You've repeatedly told her you won't, and she ignores you. I learned in high school to never become a mediator in anyone's relationship. I did it with 2 good friends for about 6 months and finally told them they needed to talk to each other, not me.

Why of all the action she could have taken was ring his sister screaming and in tears the one she took?", "I gotta tell you, if my husband was abusing me, I would NOT be looking to his (clearly biased) family for support.

Maybe there's more information needed but I don't see how this makes sense.", "I do not agree. These issues started BEFORE their baby was born, not since.\n\n>Since Hayley and Todd got married, and especially since she gave birth, Hayley has been trying to involve my mother and me in her and Todd's relationship.\n\nWe don't exactly know why Todd needed to change his credit card details. There could be a variety of reasons. Saying it could be financial control is just wild speculation. Also, in a lot of European countries people pay by debit card, not by credit card. I'm Dutch and I don't even have a credit card.\n\nIt is normal for people in relationships to have disagreements at times. But it's weird texting your MIL and SIL every time you disagree with your husband, asking their opinion and asking them to **talk to your husband on your behalf**. What are Hayley's expectations? That her MIL and SIL resolve the disagreement she has with her husband by scolding their adult son/brother? Hayley shouldn't involve her MIL and SIL in her marriage like that. And I can totally understand that MIL and SIL don't want to be involved in Hayley and Todd's marital problems (if there are any) and don't want to be put in between. Nothing good comes out of that.\n\nIf Hayley and Todd cannot solve their disagreements themselves, maybe they should seek professional help e.g., marriage counseling. Haley\u2019s MIL happily wants to help Hayley out with anything to do with adjusting to living in a different country. So, MIL will probably help Hayley out to find a proper multilingual therapist.\n\nI can understand it\u2019s hard to emigrate to a country on another continent and maybe she\u2019s feeling lonely, especially with the newborn. But Hayley crossing the boundaries of both her MIL and SIL over and over again to the point they got very annoyed isn\u2019t the way to go.\n\nHayley thinks people in Switzerland are really \u201ccold\u201d, but I think she needs to accept there is a big culture difference with the USA. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect Swiss people will act the same as Americans. Europe\u2019s culture (not sure if there even is one, because every country is different) is very different than American culture. Europeans in general don\u2019t really do the American over the top polite thing as the fakeness of it is considered very insincere, which is kind of rude. (I don't think OP's post comes across as cold)\n\nI know there are American vloggers who emigrated to Europe and talk about the differences and their experiences, positive and negative ones (I\u2019m Dutch, but I\u2019ve watched some because I think the different perspective is very interesting). Maybe it can help Hayley to watch some of them. And maybe she can find other Americans that emigrated to Switzerland to share her own experiences with.\n\nI also wonder why Hayley cannot text or video call her own friends if she needs to vent. Yes, she\u2019s in another country, but we live in a digital age where it\u2019s not that difficult to keep in contact with people who live at the other side of the world. You can work around the time zone difference if you want to.\n\nNTA.", "He didn't cut her off from his credit cards. The card got flagged for a large personal purchase. It's in one of OPs edits if you'd like to read it over. (Please do not read this under a condescending tone, I mean to use an informative one!)", "So basically OP doesn\u2019t get to set boundaries and he\u2019s required to engage in conversations that make him uncomfortable because the wife married someone who won\u2019t discuss problems with her, and he owes her an apology for doing exactly what he said he would do if she crossed his boundaries yet again.

I understand you don\u2019t seem to consider yourself that close to Hayley, so you view her actions as trying to pull you into their marriage or manipulate your brother in some way. And maybe she is.\n\nBut, on the other hand, look at it from her point of view. She moved around the world to a different country with a different culture where she doesn\u2019t know anyone except for your family. She\u2019s your brother\u2019s family now and may consider you her family then as well. So when she is struggling with feeling isolated and alone, she\u2019s reaching out to the only people she knows, the people she considers her family, and looking for a shoulder to lean on. I think that is just as likely to be what\u2019s happening.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to want or participate in that kind of relationship with her, but I think a little compassion and empathy could go a long way in at least understanding her. I\u2019ve moved to different states all in the same time zone in the US and can tell you first hand how hard it can be to keep in touch with friends and family, and how isolating it can feel until you build up new relationships even in that scenario.  It doesn\u2019t sound like she has been there very long, especially given how big an adjustment it probably is. If you don\u2019t want to have that kind of relationship with her, is there any way you can help her integrate and make some new friends there, so that maybe she has somewhere else to turn?", "I appreciate your nuanced take here. While I agree that you honestly never know what the inside of someone else's relationship is like, I think that the way this played out does not indicate abuse. If Todd \\*was\\* being abusive and you told Haley that the consequence of continuing to disregard your boundaries would be to forward her messages to Todd, she would have been too afraid of the consequences to continue to text-bomb you. \n\nThis feels more like some sort of outdated toxic sisterhood stance on relationships to me ... \"my hapless husband doesn't understand things so I'll get his mom and sister to help 'sort him out'\"", "You might be the only people to turn to in a country where they\u2019re away from every other support, and the time zones just don\u2019t match up.\n\nNot saying it\u2019s ok to over-step boundaries, just an observation of the situation", "I wouldn't be either, but I can see why someone might.

I would imagine it\u2019s an anxiety overload even for people who don\u2019t have anxiety. \n\nI don\u2019t blame OP for being frustrated and especially after repeatedly asking to be left out of it. But I don\u2019t blame SIL for her behavior.

Either way, SIL seems to be in crisis.

It strikes me as extremely cold.", "I forget the shorthand, but I would say No one is the AH here (NOITA?).\n\nIt sounds like some cultural differences, personality differences and some loneliness pushed to the extreme. Very often, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, women in America bond over complaining with other women about their spouse. Yes, even or especially to in laws. They see the bonds of womanhood with in-laws as strong as the bonds (or in some cases stronger) between blood related family of different genders. She sees you as family, and in her world, family talks about these things in this way.\n\nDoes she have friends in Switzerland? It\u2019s often hard to make friends when you\u2019re a new mother and even more so in a new country.\n\nCombined with the fact that she\u2019s a \u2018make herself at home anywhere\u2019 type of person sounds like she is used to an unreserved communication and closeness with people.\n\nShe should not be asking you to interfere in her relationship and you should not interfere. However, If you have any sort of desire of helping her in general, not in the relationship, I would talk to your brother as he is the one who knows her best, and see what other ways you could help her connect and feel more comfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to make her feel comfortable at the expense of your own comfort, but maybe you could listen to her and sometimes that all the person really needs.\n\nI agree with people that she may be in crisis. I wouldn\u2019t jump to the idea of abuse however. Being a new mother away from her own family and in an entirely new country is probably the cause. It could just be her personality type that leads her to ask for your help in interfering, but it might also be that she feels that she is cut off from much of what she has known up to now, her husband might be her only or at least one of few links to this new country . Perhaps, when she is at odds with your brother, it\u2019s making her feel desperate and exacerbating all the other feelings of displacement and loneliness she already feels being a new mother in a new country. Because if they are at odds, she is completely alone in this new country.\n\nIn the end she might just want to know she has a friendly ear nearby, another link. It\u2019s not your responsibility to be that link, but if you felt up to it, maybe could find a way to make her feel safer and that your brother isn\u2019t the only person she has.", "If she's having \"extreme\" reactions to \"normal\" couple conflicts, that would suggest she is in crisis, for whatever reason.\n\nAnd instead of offering some kind of support or referring her to someone who could offer that support, you forward her messages to your brother??

In-laws can become close, but they\u2019re not close by default just because you married their family member.

If I got someone competent but not English speaking, then I would get as far as I could with the basic French and German that I had (I was learning as much as I could but I was never fluent).

Which is not the same as having friends where she's currently at, but it's not like she has *no one.* It was also her decision to move to Switzerland when she was pregnant knowing she would only have her husband's family at first to rely on. She could have made plans with her friends to have regular zoom calls or whatnot. I don't know if OP's family has any friends that they can introduce her to, or if there are any mother groups she can join.

It says she asked for opinions and advice.\n\nBecause asking for opinions and advice about her relationship frequently is not healthy. If you need advice every time you get in a disagreement with your spouse, you need a counselor to help you navigate dealing with that. It'd be one thing if it was only every so often, but it sounds like a pretty common occurrence. The fact that she wanted OP's mom to \"speak to Todd on her behalf\" is particularly an indicator of needing counseling. There should be no reason to ask your MIL that.

The poor SIL sounds like she\u2019s having a lot of difficulties and not in the right frame of mind to address them. Instead she\u2019s blocked and any response is to highlight how wrong she is in her behavior like a stranger creating havoc in their lives.

Even the response/solution you made with forwarding the messages IS getting involved. People rarely come out and disclose anything complex, abuse whether it's verbal, financial, or sexual. I'm not saying that's what is going on but to give you some perspective here on relationships (and beyond just your family but something you could experience with friends too) everything you're doing is showing her that you're not worth disclosing too. When just the smallest attempt a person makes to test the waters is pushed back on or labeled negatively it only reinforces the idea or reality that there's no help. And maybe you are okay with that and you want it but you should realize that even amongst those close to you, if you repeatedly show you are not open to hearing things you may not like or want to then you shouldn't expect anyone to be honest about abuse in any way. \n\nI understand wanting to avoid conflict but you are in no way staying out of it if you are entertaining your brother's side of it. I understand not wanting to be involved but I think you're lacking any perspective or consideration for what she is going through. And realistically, hearing negative things about your brother isn't that crazy. If he's being shitty then he's being shitty and some of the most conflict avoidant people I know actually ENABLE bad behavior to continue.\n\nAnd being avoidant of it doesn't mean that your brother is not the cause. Being held accountable can be a form of conflict, and sometimes being all \"not about drama\" or \"not trying to argue\" are just excuses people use to avoid it and not rock the boat. Conflict isn't always bad and if your entire family is like this then it may be normalized to you that it is. There's a difference between not wanting to be dragged into a relationship and having your head in the sand. Frankly it sounds like you're all quite happy to have your heads in the sand and it will come back to bite you at some point in your life.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA. I was going to say E S H, but then I read some of your comments.\n\nIf this thread is an indication of how you've communicated with your SIL, I can see why she probably didn't get it at first. You said SIL talking to you about their marriage is a conflict of intrest(honestly I did understand what that meant until you explained it in a later comment). You also said you don't want to get involved in your brother's marriage. But in the comments you said your brother sent you pictures of the bank statement when talking to you about the credit card incident, and *of course* your brother would vent to you, he's your brother, and that she shouldn't vent to people who have loyalties to the other side. \n\nSo, it's not that you don't want to be involved. Just say what you mean: Your loyalty is to your brother, so you don't want to hear about any issues she has in the marriage because, regardless, you are going to be in your brother's side.\n\nIt does seem like there are a lot of cultural differences. America has different cultures within itself, so it's not the same for everyone, but your SIL's inital behavior makes sense to me. I was taught that when you marry someone, their family becomes your family. For example, my maternal uncle has been divorced since before I was born. My aunt (his ex-wife) still calls my mom sister, and on her last birthday, we thre her party. \n\nAlso, depending on the situation, if I was having a disagreement with my SO, it would make sense to me to ask advice from the people who know them best.\n\nAt this point, your SIL should know where she stands...alone.\n\nAs people have pointed out, she moved to a foreign country, just had a baby, and the only people she knows are her husband and his family. People mentioned her calling her friends and family in the US, but regardless of the different time zones, physically separated from your support system is isolating, and it makes you vulnerable. It's literally a tactic abusers use. (Not saying your brother is or isn't an abuser) \n\nImagine knowing that if you and your husband have an issue, there is **no one on your side of the Atlantic Ocean** that would be on your side or have your best interests at heart.\n\nAll that being said, you made a boundary, and your SIL crossed it repeatedly. You are right. Your SIL is not your responsibility, **she's your brother's**. \n\nShe crosses your boundaries. You tell your brother to handle it, but it continues. She calls you crying and screaming because she thinks your brother changed the credit card info. Even if that didn't happen, the fact that that was her assumption and her subsequent reaction is bad. Something is wrong. She needs help, and your brother isn't taking care of it. \n\nMy verdict is because of the lack of empathy/concern. If my brother wasn't helping his wife when she needed it, I would feel some obligation to do something. At the very least, I would talk to my brother about taking cate of his responsibilities.\n\nThis woman needs help. The person who has vowed to help her isn't, and there is no one on the continent who cares.", "INFO - have you checked in with her to see if Todd is stonewalling her about these issues? From the credit card example, it almost sounds like she tried to make a purchase, got a decline, and then couldn\u2019t get an answer from her husband. \n\nIt might be that Todd isn\u2019t communicating with her about certain things or shutting her out, and in desperation she\u2019s trying to get you to intercede. It could also be why this behavior is continuing, maybe Todd isn\u2019t communicating that you\u2019re unhappy with his wife\u2019s behavior and that\u2019s why she hasn\u2019t stopped. \n\nI don\u2019t think that means anything different for how you should draw your own boundaries, but there might be more going on than your SIL being overly familiar.", "NAH. I think you're right to feel uncomfortable. I know you said your brother would talk to his wife, but you also mentioned that he's very conflict averse, so it's possible he's not passing the message on strongly enough.\nFrom your SIL side, you have to remember, she's just moved to a new country; a country that is very far from home, several time zones away, the language is different and the culture and people are very different. Added to that, she's recently had a baby. PPD and PPA are shockingly underreported and under-diagnosed. It's very probable she's experiencing one or both of them to a greater or lesser extent. Either way, just having a baby turns your world upside and leaves you feeling isolated.\nWhat your SIL is actually doing is not venting about your brother, she's screaming for help.\nFor your sake you need to draw your boundaries, but please consider where your SIL is coming from. She needs help, probably medical, almost definitely therapy, but you can also help steer her towards some baby friendly places in town, or mommy groups, somewhere where she can make some friends and start building a support structure of her own. The sooner this is addressed, the better for everyone involved.", "NAH. You're not an AH for not wanting to be dragged into their relationship, but I don't really think that Hailey is an AH either. She just moved to a whole different continent and had a baby. She's completely without her family, or her support system, and it just sounds like she's struggling, and has no one to turn to.

He would try to bully me into giving him something or otherwise accomodating at my expense. I'd say no. He'd run to my mom and whine to her and because he was the favorite child (and she didn't wanna hear him whine) she'd pressure me to listen to him. I'd feel like they were ganging up on me and that maybe I was in the wrong because he'd get her support and would end up giving in.", "Came here to make sure someone had said this. Keeping a confidence is a social contract *both* parties need to agree to for it to be valid.", "I\u2019m saying NTA, but hoping your brother (or yourself) encourages her to find a social group, maybe of other new moms or fellow expats, because she does sound like she\u2019s feeling isolated/lonely and also dealing with the hormonal, emotional, physical, and mental side effects of giving birth and having a newborn (and moving to another country).\n\nIn another comment, you mention that your brother is very conflict adverse - I wonder if she\u2019s misunderstanding this as coldness on his part. With everything in her life going on, I wonder if she\u2019s struggling to communicate with him or to know HOW to have necessary conflict with him, and is thus reaching out to you and your mom who know him well.\n\nI do think that she\u2019s probably using y\u2019all as proxies/replacements for her birth family and friends back home - these are likely conversations and things she would go to them for advice for before moving, but the time difference makes it harder and she might feel a need for comfort/venting on a more immediate basis. I don\u2019t know exactly what she was saying about Todd to y\u2019all, but I wonder if she personally sees it as \u201ctalking behind his back\u201d - I mean, it is, but in my personal experience I\u2019ve done that before and never saw it in that context (which it definitely is haha - I do know Americans (USA at least) can be a lot more\u2026uh\u2026conflicty? Gossipy? haha.\n\nI hope y\u2019all can find a common ground and get past this - I hope she starts to feel more comfortable in this new country and also more comfortable with confronting HIM about what she\u2019s reaching out about. It might be worth it to try to redirect your relationship to other things after establishing a boundary about this, if you want to, but I mostly hope she\u2019s able to find her own group of friends independent of y\u2019all\u2019s family and Todd\u2019s friends.\n\nAs for the money/credit card thing, THAT feels odd and you\u2019re definitely NTA for that as well. Overall she has been inappropriate, even if there\u2019s the cultural excuse, and has pushed both you and your mom past your comfort zones.", "I think you should straight up ask her if she feels like she\u2019s being abused, and if she says no, explain that she\u2019s diluting her voice and credibility in the event that she legitimately does need help in the future.

She has no one to talk to, no friends... \n\nESH", "part of me says NTA but the other part \u2026 if she just had a baby \u2026 she could possibly be dealing with **untreated/undiagnosed postpartum depression/anxiety** maybe? and she\u2019s all alone in a **foreign country** with people who clearly don\u2019t accept her as part of their family. my \u201cmother in law\u201d (we aren\u2019t married but we might as well be) has no issues with me talking to her about her son. my own mother is\u2026 not a mother, so my MIL has taken on that role for me. i can\u2019t imagine having no support in a foreign country and my husbands mother and sister clearly not liking me. i get that it\u2019s her action\u2026 but this sounds like a cry for help. maybe that\u2019s just my bleeding heart. i had terrible PPD/PPA and i almost went fucking crazy.", "NTA\n\nBut from the opposite perspective, it sounds like Hayley is without family in a foreign country where she does not know the local languages and is stuck at home looking after a small child so finds it impossible to make friends.   She feels alone and without support whereas her husband is surrounded by supportive family who will essentially take his side by bowing out.  \n\nThe way she is presenting her distress is really unhelpful and you need to push back against that but, the underlying distress (feeling alone and unsupported) needs to be sorted out or the marriage is not going to last.  A visit back to the USA with the child is going to become a stay.", ">nt. What she's doing is called \"triangulation\", and it's incredibly toxic and dysfunctional. OP did the exact right thing.\n\nAlso Hayley is in a foreign country/culture and feels isolated. She can't just leave because of the baby.", "Great point. I was wondering the same, esp as she is living in a foreign country and may not have a support network.", "I ad it my mind went to this as well as her being in a foreign country and her SIL and mil are her support system.  Op doesn\u2019t say if she has friends or family to rely on. Something seems off.", "To be fair, we are getting OPs admittedly biased take on the situation, so take that with a grain of salt. Also I assume Hayley is American and OP isnt, so there is bound to be some cultural differences at play. Americans tend to be very \"open\" about their conflicts with others, so a fair bit of this might be lost in translation.", "> but she can't reasonably expect to talk to me or my mother about Todd behind his back. \n\nOr you could just be honest? say what you would say if todd is there. There is nothing wrong with the truth. There is nothing wrong with talking with your family.", "Ugh. I hate unnecessary acronyms. IHUA.", "Yeah but trying to connect with your in laws by complaining about ur spouse is possibly the most ineffective way to do it lol. What does she expect? OP to possibly ruin her relationship with her brother for someone she doesn't really know? Unless OP left it out it sounds like she hasn't made any normal efforts to form a friendship with OP and even if that's because she's too anxious to it's not OPs job to care", "Op has stated her boundaries and Haley needs to adhere to them, while the wife mag have that issue it still stays the same it is HER issue to fix. \n\nNot her in laws problem, Haley shouldn\u2019t be expecting people to do it for her. If she\u2019s having problems, then you get help but it is clear that op has stated where she stands and going against that is not cool.", "She can get support for all of the things that go along with being a new mom without expecting OP and her mother to badmouth their brother/son with her. She can talk to them about literally anything else, but she\u2019s trying to force OP\u2019s family to take sides in her relationship issues, and it\u2019s BS.", "That's not something he's ever mentioned.", "I actually yelled the first time I saw that line\u2026 fabulously written and delivered", "The list of people who can show up unannounced and actually have me open the door is very small.", "yeah the timing sounds like maybe postpartum depression/anxiety/etc", "Dude op ignore the commenters thinking this is normal. It\u2019s not normal. Your head is screwed on normal. Don\u2019t sweat it.", "That\u2019s not an American culture at all. If you knew your spouse for a while, maybe ya they become friends with your sister and mother. But if your sibling got married to a girl he met in another country that you barely know, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re suddenly BFFs just because you\u2019re in laws now. \n\nPeople aren\u2019t OWED friendship. Friendships develop due to shared interests or experiences, etc. This isn\u2019t a cultural thing. It\u2019s like, a social norm thing. Globally.", "NTA. \n\nA lot of people are jumping to your brother being abusive, but triangulation - trying to get other people to gang up on someone else with you - is textbook narcissistic abuse. \n\nIt could be a desperate, lonely woman who feels like she has no other avenues and is not being heard by her dismissive and controlling husband. \n\nOr it could be that she is manipulative and abusive herself. It\u2019s really hard to say without knowing the dynamics of their relationship.", "He absolutely is the AH. Young marriage on the rocks and needs support from the family and instead they tell her they don't want to get involved? It isn't meddling when a family member is begging for help. This attitude is sick. When family begs for help you help.", "Calling you screaming and sobbing out of sudden paranoia doesn\u2019t say PPD/PPA/PPP to you?", "It probably depends on the family. My MIL was eager to talk about her son, so we did. It was more from the perspective of two ladies who know all his warts and accomplishments sharing tips. Not maliciously.\n\nBut I could easily see a family not wanting to be involved in drama that way, which this sounds like. It also doesn't sound like the three of you ladies have gotten close enough to have your own relationships with each other (no shade).\n\nMaybe take her to an American Immigrant social meetup? A good place to \"perch up\" with the baby of an afternoon, like a cafe or something? Something where she can meet people outside and talk to them and that you don't despise going to once or twice.", "She\u2019s American. She probably doesn\u2019t know how to do that. I know I wouldn\u2019t.", "I think he talked to her and she ignore him, just like she ignored OP telling her to stop.", "She can drop by any hospital unannounced and get medical care, it's that simple (she only has to pay a very small sum). Health insurance is mandatory so she can't legally reside in Switzerland and not have it.       \n       \nShe could also call an ambulance if she felt it was an emergency but it's not hard in any way to get medical help and it's easy to do not only in German, French, and Italian but in other languages like English too.", "She\u2019s trying to tattle to her husbands mom about inane shit. She\u2019s acting like a child.", "If he \"talked to her\" in the way of just telling her \"don't talk to my family members about our problems,\" he's talking to her in the barest sense of the word. \nHe's not acknowledging the difficulties of the situation (isolated in a new country, different language, new baby, new marriage, distance from family and friends), and he's not working with her to help her build a local support network and community.", "100% agreed.  \n\nI think there also may be a cultural difference at play here - it seems like Hayley had the expectation of joining an extended family with her marriage and being considered a daughter/sister thereafter.  While that\u2019s an ideal that doesn\u2019t always happen, it is very much the expectation in the US.  I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true in Switzerland - sounds like maybe it\u2019s not, ftom what OP has said.", "We agree that what is going on is not healthy. Assuming it\u2019s because the SIL is looking to cause drama when there is a long list of other possibilities\u2026 there is no harm in suggesting SIL sees a therapist. There could be a huge amount of harm if OP sending those texts on led to domestic violence or SIL hiding PPD symptoms. \n\nSIL changed after the birth of the baby and the move. That should be a warning sign to get her help.", "This is BS. I had a friend move to the UK for several years, and I talked to her regularly. We just worked around the time zones. \n\nI also have family in Sweden, and speak with them pretty regularly too. \n\nThere are times of the day when it's reasonable on both ends to call. Or text. It's really not that hard.", "\"If you think about it, I proved that you *can* trust me.  I promised I'd tell Todd if you said anything else, and I did!  You're welcome.\"", "It\u2019s called creating Flying Monkeys. Classic narcissist technique. Get others to gang up on the person who dares to defy them and make themselves out to be victims so others swoop in and \u201cdefend\u201d them. Love how OP handled it.", "Hell, my bank is easier than having to talk to anyone. The app sends a notice, and they send a text. It asks: do you recognize these last 3 purchases?  Type Yes if you do. \n\nSend yes, wait 30 seconds, try card again, poof.", "Maybe being in a foreign country with what feels like unsupportive in-laws has caused her extreme stress and she finally lost it", "According to op she has always been like this since they first got married/had kids, It's just now she's on their doorstep instead of in another country"]}
