Due to an accident when I was a teenager, I can not have children. I have never wanted children of my own, so this is not as big of a deal to me as it could be. I have friends with kids who think of me as their cool aunt, and I am happy with that. This is important because of a woman I know, Ali 18F (not real name). Ali is the family member of a woman my brother is good friends with whos become basically family. Ali lives with this woman, so my whole family knows her pretty well. \n\nShe's a nice girl who had a daughter, Ann (8 months). Her baby was taken away from her due to suspected neglect. Ali decided to tell CPS that I was a safe person to place Ann with since I know the baby and live close by. I would not have had an issue with this except that Ali did not tell me. I got a call the morning after Ann was taken away at 6am. while I was getting ready for work. CPS asked me to come down and talk with them and take the baby until they have a foster placement opened. I got Ann and my boss was very understanding about me coming to work late and with a baby as I had no time to get a sitter for her and I work alone mostly anyway so she wouldn't disturb anyone.\n\nI had Ann for about a week, and CPS wanted me to get licensed as a foster parent so she could stay with me while Ali did what she needed to do to get her baby back. Shortly after I agreed to get licensed, I got a call from Ali's lawyer talking about adoption. Ali did not want Ann back and tried to paint this picture of me being this infertile woman who could finally be blessed with a kid of my own. I struggled a lot because I do love kids, but I have never wanted my own, and this felt more like Ali was putting off her responsibility onto me. Ali told me that I could afford it because I made more money than anyone else in my family/friend circle. I got pretty upset and stopped answering Ali's calls after I confirmed with her that she absolutely did not want to get Ann back. I called Health and Welfare and took back my offer of getting licensed, sending them an email from Ali's lawyer where she states she doesn't want custody. At the time, I figured that if Ali wants to put Ann up for adoption that she has the best chance of getting adopted while she is still a baby. It wouldn't be beneficial to Ann for me to foster her in hopes Ali changes her mind, and I don't want to have Ann for years and her start to think of me as her mom. I felt it would less traumatic for her to get adopted while she is a baby to a family that wants and will love her.\n\nI truly thought that was the best option, and I felt I was doing the right thing for Ann. Now I am being called all kinds of names by Ali, and she is trying to twist the story to make it seem like I am burying Ann in the system. She thought that if I adopted Ann that she could still be in her life, but not actually have to be her mom. Which is not what I would have allowed if I did adopt her. I am now questioning if I made the right call, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1678734800, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qilhm/aita_for_not_adopting_another_womans_child/", "score": 910, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are correct that her chances of being adopted and kept are much higher as a baby.  In fact, many families will happily take her.  Additionally, taking a baby in and adopting that you know the family can often be problematic.  I think she may have the best chance of not being entangled with such an unhealthy bio mom having regular access.  Regardless, you don't want her full-time.  There isn't anything wrong with that.", "NTA - Who cares if Ali is calling you names?  She's a person so twisted around that child PROTECTION services had to protect her child from her? \n\nIf you do not want to be a mother, please send the child to someone who is praying to be a parent.", "NTA, and I would have told you that was exactly what Ali was trying to do of you didn\u2019t state it in the post. She would never let you raise Ann on your own- she would interfere at every step and hold her status as \u201creal\u201d mother over your head- you would be looking at years of heartache for both you and Ann.", "NTA, and i would walk away from this and block her. It's a baby, not a doll, and she would have the best chance of getting adopted as a baby.", "NTA  \nAli is being ridiculous. I cannot imagine the nerve it would take to spring a surprise baby on someone.

You dont want to adopt her, neither should you if you dont want to be a mother for that child. Its an emotional burden that you Will have and that is almos impossible to overcome if you dont want it yourself. \n\nAli doesnt get to call you anything. She is upset that she cant have the kid around with no responsibilities. \n\nYou already did Way more than you should do by taking her in in the first place.", "NTA!!! This woman is trying to force a child on you, it\u2019s ridiculous! You are right, she stands a better chance of adoption as a baby, since Ali clearly doesn\u2019t want her, you chose the right option!", "NTA. You sound like a lovely, caring person. If you haven't already thought of it this way: There are a gazillion people out there who would give their right arms to have a healthy baby to raise. If you're not 100 percent sure you want to be a mom, in my opinion (and keep in mind, this is just one person's opinion), the right thing to do for Ann is allow her to find another loving home. You are NOT burying Ann in the system: she'll have loving, stable, decent people knocking down her door to be her parents. I think this is the real problem: Ali knows that if you adopted Ann, she could still have contact with the baby. That is NOT your problem. Ali's choices boil down to getting her act together to raise the baby, or putting the baby up for adoption. It is not up to you to forge a middle path for her. Best of luck to you and Ann.", "NTA. You absolutely did the right thing.", "NTA. You did what you could for Ann while still maintaining your boundary. Hoping the lawyer's email spelling out Ali's true wishes will unmuddle things and Ann can quickly be adopted.\n\nAlso, big thanks for quickly editing in paragraph breaks.", "Children are a big responsibility if you're not 100% sure then the answer is always no. You are doing what's best for yourself and the child, so no you're not an asshole", "Nta - you are totally in the right here. You were basically forced to look after her child and now she\u2019s making all kinds of assumptions about you. You are doing the right thing by you and that child", "NTA. Additional perspective here since best interest of the kid was covered by others. No idea what nerve this douch- I mean Ali has to think he is entitled to foist an unwanted baby on you for adoption. You aren\u2019t blood family. You aren\u2019t childhood long time bffs. He didn\u2019t save your life repeatedly as a comrade at arms in war. It seems your only social connection to Ali is just that your brother is good friends with him (or just the gal Ali lives with). As such, Ali has no basis to demand something extreme like this from you just by virtue of his relationship with your brother.", "NTA\n\nAll of this is absurd. Ann deserves to be with a family who wants her. Ali's access can be negotiated in the future but is absolutely not the priority.", "NTA. Ali is. She tried to put all responsibility away to you. Even without asking you. You don't have to take a child in, you don't want to. And hopefully Ann will get nice adoptive parents instead of Ali who neglected her before and was willing to give her away before.\n\nIf she is talking bad about you, tell the true story. That she wanted to give her daughter up and thought she chould do so by forcing you to adopt the child. So she could be still in the childs life without paying and no long awake nights", "Hilarious that Ali is calling you out for not wanting to adopt the child she is literally giving away. NTA. You are in a tough spot but you\u2019re doing what is best for the baby.", "NTA", "NTA, \n\nYou didn\u2019t ask for any of these and don\u2019t owe this Ali girl anything. Just ignore the name calling, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and the only who\u2019s actually thinking about what\u2019s best for the baby. You need to learn to distance yourself from toxic people that have absurd expectations. Ali just wanted the best from both worlds, being able to see her kid without having to raise her, so you shouldn\u2019t feel bad for not falling for it or not wanting to have kids.", "NTA. The bloody gall.", "NTA. Ali is though. She can't just choose you to raise her baby without asking. Doesn't she have any other family who could help? Make it clear to CPS you don't want children and distance yourself from Ali. Why would you want someone in your life who neglects her child? She sounds manipulative.", "So NTA! I would have told cps NO! From the get go and make them find another safe person (but I'm a stubborn \"B\" like that). You are under no obligation to take on another woman's child.", "NTA she's framing this like she's giving you the gift of a blessing since you can't have children of your own instead of realizing she's shirking her responsibilities onto you. You don't want the \"gift of motherhood\" & were blindsided by everything since CPS called you as Ann's safe person. You were correct in rescinding your offer to become a certified foster parent if you never intended on parenting in the first place (your own or anyone esles). Ali is a selfish excuse for a mother for trying to pawn the never ending duties of raising her child so she could stay in Ann's life.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nIn your shoes, I would have blown up at having my name given to CPS without my consent to begin with, and would have turned 'em down right then.  You've *already* gone above and beyond.", "NTA they don\u2019t remove kids, much less babies, unless something Is wrong, and seriously so.\n\nShe tried to play you and you refused the role she\u2019d cast you in.\n\nAnd you are right: the younger the kid the better their chances of getting adopted quickly.", "NAH\n\nLook, Ali isn't necessarily wrong to want to be in Ann's life, even if she can't handle the responsibilities of motherhood, but all the underhand lies she's been engaging with are a problem. On the other hand, she's an 18 year old mother who doesn't want the responsibility of the kid she's got - she's screwed up enough to get herself in to this situation, so it's not surprising that she's not making the best decisions otherwise.\n\nBut whether you want kids is up to you. Sure, kids are expensive, but the big burden isn't financial - it's the personal emotional effort you invest in them. And sure, that can be the biggest joy as well, but you've got to want it.\n\nYou don't want it. That's OK.", "NAH\n\nClearly you are trying to do what you can to help out in a really difficult situation, but adopting a child is a huge, lifetime responsibility that it seems pretty clear that you are not interested in.  You should not feel or be forced to adopt a child if you don't want to, regardless of the backstory and who they are.  It's an unfortunate situation but it's totally unfair to just dump a child in your lap and expect you to take it from there.\n\nI'm sure Ali is trying to make the best out of her terrible situation and would probably like for you to take custody because she trusts you and it would mean that she may at least get a chance to see the child, but it's a totally unrealistic and unreasonable thing to ask you to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
