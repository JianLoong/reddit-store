He works in Italy and comes home every month. Our plan is to live together in Italy and while he is in Italy I was supposed to live with my mother. But after we got married he  changed his mind and said that he wanted me to be with his mother(MIL). We argued a lot about that, but for the sake of peace and because it was only for a few months, I started living with MIL. At the beginning, everything was okay. After a while, I started to notice her competition with me. Before our marriage, he wanted to find an apartment where I would stay while he was not here,and for us when he comes home, but his MIL told him that if he did that, she would never visit him. He didn't want to tell me that, I found out that later. MIL gets angry when I go out with my friends. I do my chores, wash my clothes and clean up behind me, sometimes I make dinner for everyone.\nShe complains about everything, her husband, me the only person she doesn't complain about is my husband. I didn't have a lot of problems with it, I just didn't spend much time at home because of work and I didn't pay that much attention that's all. \nToday I was lying in my room, my blinds were down and the window was open so I couldn't see outside. My MIL and I share the terrace. She went out on the terrace and talked to her mother about how I am a bad wife, how I don't respect her, how i dont help her with the housework, how  I dont talk to her like his ex-girlfriends used\u00a0 to talk to her and I should be ashamed of myself. I was a little emotional, I thought we were in an okay relationship and I started to cry. That's when my husband called and I told him what happened and said that there is no need to talk to her. His mother would never admit to\u00a0 that she was wrong because in her opinion she is one of the best people in this world. I was a little hurt by her opinion but there is no need for discussion. He couldn't stand it, he asked what the problem was and why she said that. She said that she didn't say that at all, that I heard it wrong. After their conversation, she came to me and said why I want to make problems between her and her son that she didn't say that at all.I said I'm neither deaf or crazy and I don't want to argue. After that she started insulting my parents, but in the end it turned out again that she wasn't insulting my parents but\u00a0 I heard\u00a0 it wrong again. My husband always said that he would not like to leave his mother, that he would always like to live near her. That he need her in his life, but I don't need her. I packed my things and came to my mother and told my husband that I don't want to go back to his mother, that I want to start living in the apartment with him or without him.
