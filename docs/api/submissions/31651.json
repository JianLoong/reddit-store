Overexcercise is anotherform of eating disorder, so you better make sure you are not slipping back", "NTA for wanting to discuss further with the doctor, but gaining 55 lbs in a year when you started at 120 lbs is a lot and might have health ramifications. We of course can\u2019t give medical advice here, but you might consider speaking to another doctor or nutritionist about what a healthy, stable diet and body weight look like for you.", "Doctor here. If your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, liver function are normal I\u2019d have no concerns. That\u2019s a healthy weight.

But I wouldn\u2019t say that going from having an eating disorder to bulking and cutting isn\u2019t exactly healthy. EDs like the one you\u2019ve described are generally about 1) body image issues/dysmorphia and 2) tightly controlling your food intake as a way to assert control over something. You\u2019ve just flipped your body image expectations to the other direction (which arguably is more healthy) but you\u2019re still artificially controlling your caloric intake as a way to assert control over something. It\u2019s true that arguably this form of control is less unhealthy than what you were doing before, but it\u2019s really just a different side of the same coin. It sounds like you still have an eating disorder, you just have different goals now. You should probably find an MD that doesn\u2019t antagonize and talk down to you, but you should also maybe talk to a therapist about your relationship with food and body image.", "Honestly this thread just shows how anti-fat this subreddit is.

They're people, and while they have a lot of knowledge, they don't have all the knowledge. It didn't sound like you were combative, you were just trying to explain your viewpoint. Also, telling someone that's recovering from an eating disorder that now they're borderline overweight (whether or not it's true) just seems like something that should be broached in a more delicate way. You're under the care of a registered dietician, and the doctor can always take his/her concerns up with them. It's similar to one of my doctors telling me they personally wouldn't put me on a combo of meds I'm on, but if I see 4 other specialists that are okay with it, then it is what it is. \nNTA", "This story has been posted before.", "If your doctor said you\u2019re almost overweight based on BMI then he is definitely not an expert and you should not listen to him at all about this.", "I say NTA.

In terms of BMI, you're not into the overweight category, you're just on the edge of what's considered healthy but if you were to gain too much from this point forward then yes you would be overweight. But BMI doesn't account for muscle, bone and fat composition so there's a good chance that he's just talking out of ignorance. If your blood work is good and you don't feel as though your eating habits are controlled by your disorder then I'd try and stay focused on your goal. Having control of your own intake and weight is empowering, don't let a doctor who won't elaborate or discuss this further bring you down and fill you with self doubt.", "Info: if you were planning on \"cutting\" and he suggested you \"cut back\" then why didn't you just say \"yes\" to your doctor?", "So it looks like anything from 139-175 is considered \"normal\" or \"healthy\" weight for someone that's 5'11\". Healthy and normal are in quotes because the way MD's are taught to work with weight is out dated. You could be 139 pounds at 5'11\" and live on cheeseburgers, have high metabolism working for you but essentially be a heart attack waiting to happen. You can also be 175 pounds at 5'11\" and be mostly muscle to a point you are missing periods and such. It all depends on what your muscle to fat ratio is (there does need to be a balance) and your general practitioner doesn't get in to that in office. They have a reference chart of weights and heights and the ability to see weight change from prior appointments. Rapid weight gain / loss is going to flag for them no matter what direction as possible illness indicator. So he's not wrong to bring it up in appointment to confirm what's going on as an indicator, but he's a shit doctor for not listening to you when you explained it was an intentional transition. Would soft recommend finding a different primary doc that will listen to you rather than talk over or invalidate you during appointments. \n\nNTA - but as other comments have stated, be careful not to swap one ed for a different ed. If it won't cause a flair, perhaps pick up a scale that has muscle & fat mass indication. So you can see where your ratio is. Your nutritionist may have one in office if you're doing in person appointments, if having one at home would be too problematic.", "NTA.\n\nArguing is not bad, is the base for finding the truth. Most doctors are totally ignorant about weightlifting in general, and a lot of them have the \"thinking-I-am-better-than-God condition\".\nThat being said, you shouldn't do whatever the fuck you want, but you have every right to seek for a second opinion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s communicating. Having these conversations and fully understanding WHY your doctor is telling you something is unhealthy is important.
