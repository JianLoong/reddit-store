Should you also choose to teach him the Indian dialect from your grandmother's village, swell.  But if you don't, it's no one's business but yours and your husband's.  Should your child wish to learn an Indian language in future, there's no reason he can't .  Failure to introduce a third language when he's a baby is not going to hobble him in life.  Nor does it represent turning your back on your culture.\n\nIt sounds like you're British and that English is your mother tongue, not your grandma's dialect.  And given that your grandma speaks fluent English, it's difficult to see her insistence that his not knowing *her* mother tongue will in any way cut him off from her as anything but bizarro hyperbole.\n\nIt's really hard for immigrant parents to see their children and grandchildren (and in this case, great-grandchildren) not being completely steeped in their native cultures.  But the fact is, they moved to the U.K.  They raised children in the U.K. Those children raised children in the U.K.  It is very unrealistic to expect English-born children raised in England not to assimilate somewhat given that several generations later, you're pretty darned English, and that's your language.  Your native language and culture are British, maybe British immigrant given the insularity of the British, but British.\n\nBeen there done that from a different background, I get it.

It's possible she's scared she'll be forgotten. She may feel she can at least leave some kind of lasting impression on her great grandchild with her \"mother tongue.\" If someone asked why he knows it later on, he could say it's because of her.\n\nOf course, it's not a reasonable expectation. Getting old and facing how short your future might be can do a number on \"reason\" though. I'm not saying my explanation is right on; I'm just using it as a way to explain how her reaction is likely part of a bigger picture.

We now live in the country were all us are from but my mother grew up in a country where the native language is English and something else.   \nBecause we moved here when I was a toddler, I was never taught English or the other language. Is not a language they speak here and it's a language only used in that other country.   \nI learned english in school, just like everyone else. Maybe I had an earlier understanding because my mum and aunt were speaking english with each other around us. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say, is that if the language is not a necessity to communicate with anyone (relatives, friends or in the country you currently living) it's not something that you need to teach your kid right now. If in the future the kid shows interest in that language and sure, go ahead and teach him. \n\nThat being said, he should still learn your culture. That's different. Maybe it would please your family if at least you tell them that you will raise him knowing his Indian side of his culture?", "Nta but teaching her your mother tongue would be great tbh kids pick up easily", "YTA for not reading the room. Clearly, you can choose what language to teach your kids (as long as you don't actively hinder their chances in life).

With more and more jobs being offshored to India, speaking one of the major Indian languages could be a big advantage for getting work in life - so many businesses run into problems with British English or American English being different dialects from Indian English leading to misunderstandings.  Being able to switch languages to clear up misunderstandings is a very marketable skill.\n\nIt\u2019s also part of your son\u2018s culture.  My family pretty much completely turned its back on our culture 3 generations ago.  It\u2019s understandable that they did, because they were Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Ukraine in the 20s and 30s, but my dad\u2019s generation and my generation have felt its loss.  My great-grandpa and his sons demanded that English be the language spoken in their home (even though Yiddish was the only language my great-grandparents shared when they met), and my father\u2019s generation only has little bits and pieces of the language (mostly somewhat rude words, like tuchus) and the culture.  My dad and my cousin and I have all done a fair amount of reading and very tentative reaching out towards the communities we should have been part of, because it\u2019s hard wanting to belong but not belonging because you weren\u2019t taught it, weren\u2019t raised in it.\n\nSo I would say YTA.", "YTA\n\nNot because you dont want to teach it to him but because of the way on handled it.  \nMoreover i dont see the hurt in teaching him somme words.", "NTA for the message in itself, but probably you could have delivered it in a more diplomatic way.", "NTA, but I don't think you should have laughed at her.   \n\nYou're correct on all points, but by laughing at her you lost some of the moral high ground.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
