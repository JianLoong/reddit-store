And given that your grandma speaks fluent English, it's difficult to see her insistence that his not knowing *her* mother tongue will in any way cut him off from her as anything but bizarro hyperbole.\n\nIt's really hard for immigrant parents to see their children and grandchildren (and in this case, great-grandchildren) not being completely steeped in their native cultures.  But the fact is, they moved to the U.K.  They raised children in the U.K. Those children raised children in the U.K.  It is very unrealistic to expect English-born children raised in England not to assimilate somewhat given that several generations later, you're pretty darned English, and that's your language.

My first language is English. I learned Spanish and am fairly fluent. But the agreement with my children\u2019s father (whose mother tongue is Spanish) was that I would speak to them in English and he would speak to them in Spanish. He doesn\u2019t. He speaks to them in English, because while fluent in Spanish, he has spoken primarily in English since he was 6 years old and he was never intentional about speaking to them in Spanish even when I would point it out. My in-laws like to criticize ME for not speaking to them in Spanish, but they say nothing to my husband about it! Telling them what the arrangement was supposed to be wins me no favor/sympathy. Really irritating, but I\u2019ve learned to ignore it.", "NTA the mother tongue is the Mom s native language not the grandparents so you aren't denying anything to anyone even if you would speak it fluently", "No it's your desicion - period!", "NTA as an Indian who is living in India you are absolutely not an asshole. There is no scope of your son settling in India other than some vacations or he just somehow wants to settle here when he grows up. I will be honest India does not have many job opportunities, when you compare living conditions to UK it's not great, at this point people are leaving India for better opportunities. \n\nBut at the same time I do understand where she is coming from. My cousin lives in US and comes here maybe once in two years and my cousin and SIL both converse with their sons in English and neither my uncle nor my aunt can talk to them. But it is different as your gp can converse in English. Maybe she is missing her country and culture and wants her grandchildren to have it. Maybe she is afraid that after she passes away her grandchildren won't have anything from their culture. \n\nSee you can come to a middle ground and teach them your language (India has lots of languages) and culture from youtube occasionally. \n\nAs an Indian seeing future generations not knowing our rich history and culture does pains me too. Overall you are NTA", "NTA - everything else aside, how on earth are you supposed to teach him if you\u2019re not fluent yourself? If grandma really wants him to pick it up, she can try talking to him in her language herself. But that\u2019s on her, it\u2019s not on you.", "NTA", "You can't immerse him in something you don't know yourself.", "NTA she was very rude but I understand her point. Culture is important! Even if you were raised British you have roots in India. It's important to know where you come from so you can know where you go. And this means you and ur child could relearn the language together to further bond. It'd be beautiful. But she definitely shouldn't have spoken to you the way she did and you're right for saying it doesn't make sense to you considering she never passed on the language fully to you in the first place. Idk colonialism is rough. Lots of cultures lost their languages and their connection to themselves. I feel personally as a black American it's important to hold onto whatever remnants of ur heritage that you can but again this is all my personal thoughts and opinions obviously you don't need to feel this way and can choose to do what you want. It might help with ur child's future tho if they learn a language young. They'll have an easier time learning others and also be able to get more jobs.", "NTA. Your logic is perfectly sound.", "NTA\n\nIf your grandmother wanted the language to spoken by her descendants then she should have taught it.", "Euh not the AH but the title had me confused. Talking. Language to your child you don\u2019t really master does not improve the relationship and creates a distance", "Her mother tongue is not English.  My kids mother tongue is still Panjabi, even though their mom was born in the west, grandparents on both sides are from Panjab.  I think its sad when kids in extended families, grandkids, cousins kids, etc cannot speak their native language of Panjabi.  This is how languages end.  Like the Grandma is a little late to the party, in that she should have made sure grandaughter could speak the language fluently to make sure its passed on to her kids etc.  However, OP can still learn. It'd be neat for kids to be able to speak that language too, and it preserves the language.  If every immigrant family stopped speaking that language 2 generations down the line, we're going to lose these languages fast.", "You are the AH to OP. You are being a hypocrite and also lacking compassion. It's harder for him to teach that dialect if he does not know them as well. The grandma was being unreasonable just like you are.\n\nDepending on where he lives he would have to spend MONEY to teach his kid the dialect.\n\nCan you pay for his lessons stranger since you care so much about his culture?", "They do yes but the only person who speaks it is grandma. I see her once a year now that I\u2019m abroad, and she doesn\u2019t make phone calls so I\u2019m at a loss.", "The audacity to come and lecture me about this is astounding.\n\nDo you think I am ignorant of any of that?\n\nBut 3 generations down the line is a little late to start lecturing me about the problem. Every one of my grandparents could\u2019ve given us the language. They chose not to.\n\nIt\u2019s not my fault we don\u2019t speak it. It\u2019s directly Nani\u2019s. So for her to turn around and accuse me of some betrayal is a total hypocrisy tyvm", "If OP\u2019s grandmother wanted future generations to know her dialect, she would have made sure she taught her children and grandchildren and would have used it regularly. She would have made sure that her children were raised as Indian instead of British. She would have offered to teach her great-grandchild herself. But she didn\u2019t. She raised her children as if they were British. Her grandchildren were raised as if they were British. She cannot be upset that the child she raised British Raider her grandchild British, or that the grandchild that her child raised British is raising her own child as British, because she did nothing to ensure that her own cold was raised Indian. You cannot expect subsequent generations of diaspora to do what you did not in raising them. You cannot assimilate into the culture of the country you move to, not raise your child in the culture of your country, and then be upset that your child\u2019s child is raising their own kid with the culture of the country you raised your own child in, the culture that more grandchild was also raised in.", "Are not teaching", "As I said in the post he\u2019s already learning 2 languages. If and when it becomes appropriate then we might add more.\n\nAs far as culture, as I\u2019ve said many times, we dress, eat, and follow Indian traditions. There is now a very distinct identity that belongs to the British Indian diaspora and I\u2019m proud to be a member of that community.\n\nBut quite frankly it\u2019s not my fault I\u2019ve not been taught that language, and if I don\u2019t have a command of it how am I being expected to teach it to someone else?", "If it's possible to teach him, then please do. So many languages are dying off due to colonialism and they must be preserved in some way. I'm not saying that for just your language, I'd say this for any, including Welsh, Gaelic, etc. And aside from that, your child will benefit from learning other languages for brain development. It would teach him an essential life skill and have the ability to assimilate to any situation and truly make him a global citizen. NTA Your relative is crazy for expecting you to teach something you don't know. But if you know others who do, do try to get them to teach your son. It's not about how useful that language is, but it's more about the art of learning a language. It will be very handy for him. Learning an Indian language in particular would be very useful for him too. From my minimal experience, I've noticed Asian languages are faster at conveying their thoughts and feelings and have very different sentence structures compared to English, which is just an amalgamation of multiple and borrowed grammar principles.", "I mean my mother tongue is absolutely English. It\u2019s the language I\u2019ve grown up speaking since my infancy. It\u2019s the language I think in, the language I default to", ">Her mother tongue is not English.\n\nWhy? Because she is not white then it's impossible for her mother tongue to be english? If we go this way can she even be considered english then?\n\nAlso by definition, a mother tongue is the language you learned when you were a child. NOT what language your grandparents spoke.", "I'm so sick of people giving the elderly people a pass just because they're old. This wasn't a case of the grandmother being sweet and concerned about her great grandson. If she truly cared about her culture being passed down, she would have taught OP the dialect. She's just being a phony hypocrite, guilt tripping OP about something she herself didn't do. We need to start calling the elderly out on their bad behavior more.", "Read my words again, I think you completely missed my point. I said he's the AH for not reading the room. I didn't say he's the AH for not teaching his kid (in fact I said the opposite).", "You need to learn to read . It said so on his post before he made the edit. Stop pretending that OP changed info", "Actually the best way would be to let the kid talk grandma and they'll pick it up", ">learning of one's native language\n\nI'd argue that your native language is whatever you learned growing up, not what your parents or grandparents spoke first.", "OP already said he was effectively bilingual. She doesn't know the language and he doesn't need to know it as a child. He can learn it himself when he gets a little older if he really wants to because it's already been preserved through the internet and probably countless books. English does not consist of \"borrowed grammar principles\". It's more specific and detailed than most modern languages. That's why it's difficult.", "u/Not_Related-7 - tried responding to you, says your post is unavailable? Weird.\n\nIt's the specific dialect she mentioned. And you don't know if they've preserved it or not though. So many of them are just spoken and don't have written versions that it's hard to preserve. If it's a case of rarity, like with an Indigenous language, those tend to get passed orally and not through any other means. And if it's not \"popular\" enough, effort isn't made to preserve them or resources just aren't delegated to do it. And actually, that's basically what English is. So many principles from German, French, Latin, etc., and so many borrowed words from different languages too. It's difficult to learn because of the lack of consistency and how much time is used in articles and such. What would take 5-6 words to convey a point, there are languages that can do that with half the words. It makes it really difficult for non-Native English speakers to keep track. I mean, how would you explain that the plural for goose is geese, but moose is still moose? Not even Native English speakers are going to know that moose is a relatively new word that was added from a Native American language, so therefore, doesn't get the same treatment.", "Op said so before the edit. Stop backtracking liar", "You replied to me, hi I\u2019m OP", "Liar", "Sure, if they see each other regularly enough. OP wasn\u2019t refusing to allow the kid to learn the grandmother\u2019s dialect, just pointing out to the grandmother WHY the kid hasn\u2019t been taught it.", "Here is the link to the original, unedited version, which lacked all manner of important context. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mqku6/comment/k7mjwf7/ \n\nWould you like to retract your accusation now?", "I didn't say that I'm just trying to suggest a solution"]}
