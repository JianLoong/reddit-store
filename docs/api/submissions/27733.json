A lot of it stems from my wife not wanting to spend much time with my parents after feeling she was mistreated by them early on. My parents don\u2019t feel they mistreated her. Early on, I tried to get them to spend more and more time together, in hopes they'd get to know each other better and things would improve. But things just got worse / more awkward. Over time, if my parents were in town, my wife would limit her interactions with them, be it with work or other activities. And when we visited them for the holidays, we\u2019d stay at a hotel even though they would have preferred we stay in their home. \n\nA few years ago, my brother suggested I stop bringing my wife to visit my parents at all. He said if they dont get along, why force it? I asked my parents what they thought, and while they were disappointed, they agreed what matters most is having family time. They stopped visiting us at our home as well. Nowadays, when my parents are in our area, they stay with my aunt. My wife basically doesn\u2019t see them anymore, except at like weddings. That said, she continues to encourage me to spend time with them when they\u2019re in town, or to visit them as much as I like, which I do several times a year. While I dont enjoy feeling as though I have 2 separate families, to me it\u2019s better than forcing people who don\u2019t like each other to spend time together.\n\nWhich brings me to now. I am a singer and I have a series of shows coming up in a month. My mom wants to come to town to support me. She asked if she can stay with me, which she hasn\u2019t done in many years. My wife doesn\u2019t like houseguests generally (and hates being a houseguest too), and I feel that having my wife and mom under the same roof at all, let alone during the weekend of my shows, would be extremely stressful for me (and my wife!). So I told my mom that while I appreciate her support, I\u2019d much rather she stay with my aunt, or I will help her find a good hotel or airbnb (cost is not an issue, my mom can easily afford this). \n\nMy mom was extremely upset, and said that if I am concerned about it being uncomfortable having her and my wife in the same home, that I should ask my wife to go somewhere else, whether it be staying at a friend\u2019s house or going out of town. I thought this was a terrible idea, and I told her so. \nAITA\n\nedit : most people seem to have understood the resolution here, but a few didnt, so let me restate -- when my mom suggested I ask my wife to stay somewhere else, I firmly said no. I didn't entertain the idea for a millisecond. I then posted here because she said \"I think plenty of people would see my idea as reasonable\".

They've known each other for 20 years & don't get along.\n\nSo your mother offered to kick your wife out of her own house so she could stay there when she had other options. And you're on reddit to find out if you're an asshole for \"thinking it was a bad idea\".\n\nSo you're one of those. The unbeatable duo : toxic MIL & mama's boy.\n\nAnd I think you know all the things your parents did to your wife. You're one of those husbands who see but don't act, your wife must have complained several times, they didn't respect her boundaries and she got fed up. You talk about the disaster that is their relationship as if you didn't know anything about it, but you've obviously seen things deteriorate.\n\nSo I guess... NTA.

Or do you see this as not your problem? Sounds like you avoided the issue because it wasn\u2019t directed at you, rather than taking a stand against your parents, and for that you are an AH. You could have shut this down early and didn\u2019t.", "I really feel like you are not backing up your wife. She says she\u2019s been mistreated. Why don\u2019t you believe her and support her?  Are you the golden boy of narc parents?", "\"Mom, we need to have a serious talk. It's very important that you listen to me this time. You and my wife have not been able to get along for 20 years now. The reason for this is that we [don't say \"she\" this is about the 2 of you as a united couple] feel you are disrespectful to her. This request proves that to be true. You have asked me to kick my wife out of our marital home so that you can sleep here instead. That is wildly inappropriate. It shows me that you do not recognize the problem at all -and that means I have no reason to believe you will change. You have been disrespectful to my wife for 20 years, Mom. When you are not kind to her you are also being mean to me. Because the two of us are a married unit. If you cannot respect my marriage and my home then you must continue to rent a hotel room. Disrespecting us in our home is not an option. I am not going to discuss this again. You can decide if you will follow the rules, which are a consequence of nearly 20 years of problems. If that won't work for you then we will continue to grow apart. I would prefer you would respect our boundaries so that we can maintain the relationship as it is. But again, this boundary is a result of you choosing to be unkind for two decades. It's not up for discussion. You can respect us, or you can be distant. It's up to you.\" \n\nNTA. 20 years of being an ass to your second half is gross and it deserves consequences. You don't kick a married woman out of her house just so you can feel better about yourself and that's what your mom is doing.

Who tf asks for this?!", "Nta\n\nThe idea that your mom even had the nerve to utter that request, tells me you don't really shut their nonsense down.\n\nCuz in what world would anyone have the audacity to ask your wife to leave her home to accommodate someone that doesn't even like her.\n\nYour family disrespects your wife, and you keep entertaining them. \n\nEpitomy of mommy's boy.", "It\u2019s clear to see why your wife doesn\u2019t like her..

Good on you hubby.", "Whichever way you split this your mother expects your wife to leave HER HOME so your mother can be there. \n\nFor that opinion alone I feel that your parents probably did disrespect your wife and YOU failed her repeatedly over many years.
