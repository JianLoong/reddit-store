A lot of it stems from my wife not wanting to spend much time with my parents after feeling she was mistreated by them early on. My parents don\u2019t feel they mistreated her. Early on, I tried to get them to spend more and more time together, in hopes they'd get to know each other better and things would improve. But things just got worse / more awkward. Over time, if my parents were in town, my wife would limit her interactions with them, be it with work or other activities. And when we visited them for the holidays, we\u2019d stay at a hotel even though they would have preferred we stay in their home. \n\nA few years ago, my brother suggested I stop bringing my wife to visit my parents at all. He said if they dont get along, why force it? I asked my parents what they thought, and while they were disappointed, they agreed what matters most is having family time. They stopped visiting us at our home as well. Nowadays, when my parents are in our area, they stay with my aunt. My wife basically doesn\u2019t see them anymore, except at like weddings. That said, she continues to encourage me to spend time with them when they\u2019re in town, or to visit them as much as I like, which I do several times a year. While I dont enjoy feeling as though I have 2 separate families, to me it\u2019s better than forcing people who don\u2019t like each other to spend time together.\n\nWhich brings me to now. I am a singer and I have a series of shows coming up in a month. My mom wants to come to town to support me. She asked if she can stay with me, which she hasn\u2019t done in many years. My wife doesn\u2019t like houseguests generally (and hates being a houseguest too), and I feel that having my wife and mom under the same roof at all, let alone during the weekend of my shows, would be extremely stressful for me (and my wife!). So I told my mom that while I appreciate her support, I\u2019d much rather she stay with my aunt, or I will help her find a good hotel or airbnb (cost is not an issue, my mom can easily afford this). \n\nMy mom was extremely upset, and said that if I am concerned about it being uncomfortable having her and my wife in the same home, that I should ask my wife to go somewhere else, whether it be staying at a friend\u2019s house or going out of town. I thought this was a terrible idea, and I told her so. \nAITA\n\nedit : most people seem to have understood the resolution here, but a few didnt, so let me restate -- when my mom suggested I ask my wife to stay somewhere else, I firmly said no. I didn't entertain the idea for a millisecond. I then posted here because she said \"I think plenty of people would see my idea as reasonable\", and I intend to show her the responses.

Disrespecting us in our home is not an option. I am not going to discuss this again. You can decide if you will follow the rules, which are a consequence of nearly 20 years of problems. If that won't work for you then we will continue to grow apart. I would prefer you would respect our boundaries so that we can maintain the relationship as it is.

Allow me to reiterate what everyone else has said and tell you that your son is definitely NTA. \n\nIt's a bit much to ask someone to leave their own home to allow someone they feel disrespected them to stay, and I'm sure you'd agree if you were in her shoes. \n\nClearly you've done a well enough job in raising your son with love and respect towards women, and that ESPECIALLY goes towards his wife. It's unreasonable to expect someone to give up their home to you when you have other options. \n\nYou may not have known what you've done to make her feel disrespected, but the way you can respect her now is by showing you care about her comfort in her own home.
