It\u2019s not reasonable to walk out on someone you\u2019ve known for years, who\u2019s been polite with phone etiquette all that time, for being bad once.

If the guy is moving really far away, he's probably anxious, possibly chatting with someone on his phone about what's going or any number of things. \n\nInstead of ASKING him what was going on, you had a tantrum and left. \n\nWhy is communicating so hard?", "Use your words.

The benefits have only been going on for a few months, but I\u2019ve known him far years. Let\u2019s call him Joe. \n\nJoe is moving across the country next week, and this was, presumably, the last I\u2019ll see him in a while.\n\nWe only see each other about once every 1-2 weeks, but spend about 6 hrs together when we do hang out. We typically chill for a little bit, go grab dinner and/or drinks, head back to his place and get down and dirty, talk for a while, and then I leave.\n\nWe both will check our phones throughout the night, which has never been a problem. It\u2019ll be non-intrusive, like scrolling while the other is in the bathroom and then putting it away, or taking a couple mins to answer a text here and there. I understand that being totally disconnected over the course of multiple hours is unrealistic for most people, myself included. I will add that Joe is currently in between jobs and doesn\u2019t have any children, so nothing on his phone is related to work or family.\n\nAnyway, last night was a little different. Maybe it doesn\u2019t matter, but we got down and dirty first, and then went to dinner. At the end of dinner, I was telling a story and while talking, I announced I was taking my phone out to find something directly related to the story, like a \u201clet me find this, you\u2019ve got to see this\u201d thing. Joe took his phone out at the same time and started scrolling and double tapping (Instagram?), never looking up even though I was still talking, still in the middle of my story. Eventually, I trailed off, thinking the story must be boring him, but didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it. \n\nWe left the restaurant shortly after. Went back to his place and put on a movie. Joe was on his phone for a few mins during the beginning of the movie. Whatever, no problem. But about an hour in, around 11pm, Joe took his phone out and never put it away. He was on Facebook (I know because at one point, he showed me something on his feed) but was also clearly messaging with someone back and forth. This went on for at least 15 minutes, probably longer. \n\nThe movie wasn\u2019t quite over, but I got up, put my coat and shoes on. Joe didn\u2019t look up.\n\nI walked toward the door, stood there for a few seconds aimlessly, then said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll see ya later.\u201d\n\nJoe looked up and said, \u201cWait, no hug?\u201d\n\nOne foot out the door now, I said, \u201cNo, it seems like you\u2019re pretty busy there.\u201d\n\nJoe said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to deal with some things here.\u201d\n\nI said something like, \u201cYeah, I can see that. Bye,\u201d and shut the door. I drove off and haven\u2019t spoken to Joe since. \n\nAITA for leaving so abruptly?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
