I said no, then he said to my mom \"well anyway Amaryllis is a girl, why waste that much money on her college?\". I completely LOST IT. I yelled out \"you know what, I've had enough.

Your SD and SB found out what lack of respect is like when you justifiably turned the tables on them.\n\nUnder no circumstances should you allow yourself to be pressured to give any of your college money to Damon. As you pointed out it is YOUR money left to you by YOUR grandmother to fund YOUR education and they have zero claim to it.\n\nEven if you were inclined, of your own motivation, to give any money to Damon it sounds like if would be wasted because he doesn't take school as seriously as you. If he had put forth effort he could have either gotten an academic or sports scholarship to help pay for his school if he knew his father wasn't in a position to help him.
