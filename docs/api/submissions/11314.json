She allowed SD to make sexist comments and Damon to insult your intelligence, then called *you* an asshole for responding accurately? Leave those people in your dust while you're off making your bright, awesome, Ivy league future.\n\nETA: Good on your grandma for setting this fund up in a way that no one else can get their hands on it without your permission.", "NTA and congratulations on getting into your dream school. 1 thing make sure you are the only one with access to the money not your mother or stepdad.", "NTA not in the least", "NTA you kept your dignity. They didn't.", "Put the funds in an account at a bank not used by SD, SB and your spineless mother.   Also be forewarned that when you have a good paying job, SD will ask you to give money to his never do well son because he can't hold a job.  NTA, but theothers are.", "NTA, but if your family is truly not well off, EVERY Ivy is free or nearly so. Having a college fund in your name can ruin that, depending on a number of specifics. Look into it. Better to have Dartmouth or wherever give you grants based upon your parents' income and then you have cash for grad school or a house. \n\nPssst, high school redditors: The secret to free college is to get into a school that meets 100% of need and enter into a sham marriage, since your aid will then be based upon the couples' income instead of the parents'!", "NTA. Your mom is allowing these dudes to talk to you this way. When you move out for college, stay out.", "NTA!!!!! You go girl dont share sht enjoy that Ivy League Education and tell your mother's husband to kick rockz", "NTA- it is your college fund gifted to you by your grandmother for your own education. \n\nIf your step-father is so keen for his son to go to college, he can pick up the tuition fee bill on his own own dime. Or take out half a dozen interest charging loans for Damon's education.  \n\nEnjoy your uni life and never give your step-father or his obnoxious son any of your money, emotion nor time. They don't deserve any. \n\nGood luck!", "Your mother is not your ally, that's my biggest concern. If she takes their side over yours that's a warning sign to you to get away as soon as possible from them all and only tell your mother what you must. Don't give any of them a cent.", "Not a ton to add. NTA.\n\nYour Mom is probably the real problem given how she supports these 2 sexist abusers. I'm sorry OP, g'luck having a relationship with her later but you'll probably need to go NC for a few years when you go to college.", "Stories like this sound so fake.", "NTA. But what's the logic behind Damon thinking he's smarter than you? You're the one that got accepted to an Ivy.", "NtA . Get your schoolin and gtfo from that bullshit and don't look back. Fuck that noise", "No they're the assholes, it's your money and considering he failed and is going to a worse of college cause he can't get into a good one like you you're clearly smarter..", "NTA. I hope you can stay with your bio dad? I bet stepfather decides to start charging you rent.", "NTA.\n\nYTW(inner.) \ud83d\ude01 Congratulations on your admission!!!", "NTH\nI\u2019m appalled by your mom in that situation, she should\u2019ve had your back.\nI wish you luck at college!", "NTA, your grandma saves the money for YOU. It is now your money and you get to decide what you should use for that money for College.\n\nI'm sorry that your mom didn't defend you and the fact that you are living with two sexist family members.\n\nMy best advice is discuss with your grandma about what happen, secure your savings and move with your Grandma in case things got worse.", "Absolutely NtA. Good for you", "NTA. grandma left it for you for your education. God I hope they can\u2019t gain access to that money.", "NTA, but your whole family sounds toxic AF. Go to college and cut them all off entirely.", "NTA. Check with your college, if you are not wealthy, a lot of them have waived tuition fees (scholarships) that you might qualify for. You should check it out. If you do not need the money, you could give it back to your grandmother or ask to keep it for a house down payment.", "NTA \n\nCongrats on getting in", "NTA in general. Your mom surprisingly is the bigges one. \n\nIn terms of Damon though I think you didn't act in the best light. Not your fault you were under pressure, were insulted and upset. I do not blame you in the lightest. I do want you to put yourself in Damons shoes though. He is being pressured into doing something he does not want. He is unconfortable and his snide comment which is obviously not true was likely said out of anxiety and discomfort. Everyone at the table knows you are the more intelligent one. You did not need to lash out at him that harshly. Once again I'm not blaming you he did say what he said but you should treat others in kindness when they are struggling like that. You shouldn't embarrass and destroy their reputation like that.\n\nI'd like more info on Damon has he been pressuring you for the money? They way you wrote it it all sounds like he's somewhat of a victim.", "NTA, my opinion? He should go to hell", "NTA good for you!  You told them the truth, that does not make you an AH. Shame on your mother for allowing this bullying to happen to you, that is your money fair and square, he is not entitled to a penny. He has his own parents, grandparents, whoever to provide for him, or he could\u2019ve worked during his \u201cgap year\u201c and saved up for school.", "NTA and good on you for calling them out. Cheeky little parasites. Ps well done on your achievement re college. \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. YOU GO! \ud83e\udd42\ud83e\udd73\ud83d\udca3 seriously. You go to school, kick ass and show that jerk what a girl can do!", "Nta. All the way.", "NTA, obviously. Your family lives in Bizzaro world. Sad that even your mom\u2026\n\nI will say? I honestly read your stepbrother saying \u201cAdmit I\u2019m smarter\u201d as sarcasm/self-deprecating joke. Your family reacted like a cartoon in this story is probably why I can\u2019t imagine him being serious. Not saying I don\u2019t believe you, but your family is unbelievable. Just\u2026 get out while you can.", "Everyone is an AH but you.", "NTA, throw your whole family away", "NTA. what the hell is with all these posts with step parents mooching off their step children? bloody appalling.  OP I hope your mum pulls her damn socks up.  That money is for YOU", "Go destroy their ego! Love it!", "Protect your money, please make sure they can't access it.", "His name is literally demon lol. NTA", "If you\u2019re gonna fake a story, at least make it believable", "NTA", "NTA but your stepfather and stepbrother definitely are. I don't understand why your own mother called you AH when she should have defended you and protected you. She failed you.", "NTA. And For your stepfather\u2019s information, there are more women than men enrolled in most colleges these days.", "NTA.  Sounds legit to me.", "NTA\n\nTell ur step brother if he is smarter he can get his scolorship, and say that with grin\n\nAlso tell ur step father and brother if he so smart, stop asking for ur money coz smart people dont look smart while begging money frm others.", "NTA. Enjoy college and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA\n\nMake sure those college funds are safe from the AHs in your family, though.", "Nta it your money congrats on  getting into a  ivy enjoy it", "SD and Damon suck, but your mother....jesus christ. NTA.", "Your grandmother's money wasn't intended for your mother's new family, men who are legal strangers to you. Do not let them social engineer you out of your future.\n\nNTA\nMake sure your mom isn't on the bank account. She might loot it.", "Seriously, her family blows. OP please make sure no one else has access to your account. I wouldn\u2019t put it pass Mommy Dearest and SD to \u201cborrow\u201d money", "It's amazing how many people feel entitled to other people's college funds.", "And congratulations to OP for standing up for herself like a fucking boss! \n\nOP NTA. Secure your future.", "OP needs to deposit the funds in a bank not used by her family.", "This attitude was outdated and unacceptable when my dad heard it from college professors in the late 80s. The ensuing 30 years has made it even more unacceptable.", "My parent's were like that, tried to talk me out of college \"because I would just end up dropping out* to get married\".  But at least in their defense they were born in the early 1920s.\n\n*jokes on them, I have a master's degree.\n\nNTA", "So mommy threw her daughter under the bus to placate a selfish slob and his useless offspring.  I hope OP remembers this when any of them ask her for money in the future.", "This! I can just imagine how SD treats mom, I'm sensing not with a ton of respect. I'll echo others advice to lock down the funds, but ensure mom can't access it either. My mom (I always giggle at how inappropriate that title is) wrecked my credit when I was 19yo. My SD was king. Unfortunately there are so many failed parents.\n\nAlso OP NTA", "This. I'd give you an award if I could afford it; well said.", "Isn't this 2023? Which year it's OP's stepdad from? Did he timetravel from 1203 or something?", "And free child care from female relatives!  I\u2019m just waiting for the follow-up post where OP is in grad school and her brother and his girlfriend are upset that OP won\u2019t rearrange her school schedule to watch the kids.", "Gen z be gen Z, whether it's at Yale, Arizona State, or Hollywood Upstairs Medical College.", "But if it wasn't in a specific college account, like a 529, OP could probably get a ton of grant aid, since every Ivy meets 100% of demonstrated need for every non-foreign undergrad (some include overseas student, maybe just HYP). Then they can exit school with not only no debt, but a few hundred thousand in the bank.", "That was my first thought. If mom has access to the account that means step dad does too, and I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if just enough for Damon\u2019s college tuition end up missing  \n\nOP please go and transfer the money to an account solely in your name if it\u2019s not already!!", "Partial comment stolen from u/dpdragonfly\n\nu/miserdfgh is a bot", "Snidely Whiplash, the BEST moustache twirler !!!\n\nNTA\n\nmake sure that money is in a place where they can\u2019t get at it.\n\nETA: make sure you get a good education and a career that leaves them in the dust!", "This is the best", ">Snidely Whiplash, the BEST moustache twirler !!!\n\nI'd say that Dick Dastardly (and his dog Muttley) was not far behind.", "Clearly we are from the same era.
