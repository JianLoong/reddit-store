Your steps are awful (thank god not blood relations) and your mother is acting just as horrifically by allowing such behavior from them.  Finishing college without debt is a huge blessing and relief and your grandmother wanted that for YOU and you alone have earned it.  The conversation should now be closed.  Protect your money (don\u2019t trust misogynistic assholes not to also be devious) and have an amazing four years!", "NTA", "Nah and this random internet stranger is proud of you for putting them in their place by simply speaking the truth", "NTA. Take all of your college fund and go to your prestigious university. Try to find a way to ensure you never have to go back to that house.   \n\n\nAlso, congratulations on getting into your dream school - you've earned it!", "NTA. It\u2019s your money and you don\u2019t owe anyone anything. He can fund his son\u2019s education he just doesn\u2019t want to probably cause he knows it will be a waste.  Your mom sucks for not standing up for you. Make sure they don\u2019t have ability to access the money.", "NTA Sounds like your mom has a habit of letting your SDs bs slide and putting you down to keep the peace. Glad you\u2019re getting out of the household.", "No and your mom kinda sucks for not backing you actually she very much does.  Go be successful and run it in. You are an adult you don't have to talk to them anymore.", "Soooo NTA.\n\nHow much do you want to bet that if the situation were reversed they'd tell you to kick rocks?", "NTA. Do not give Damon a dime of your tuition or maybe only give a dime lol. Congrats on your dream school.\n\nEdit: Make sure no one can access that money besides you.", "Is your mother always so weak? Anyway. If you give a red cent to those aholes you will be disrespecting your grandmother's hard work and what she did for you. Then you will be the a h. So, NTA. Don't give in. And when you're done with school,  get rid of the awful biological family.", "NTA. Congratulations on getting into your Ivy League college! Smart AND lucky to beat the odds. Work hard and party hard (I did). Expect a certain amount of pushback from jealous people. It means nothing. Your stepfather and brother are TA. Your mother is problematic because she hadn\u2019t got your back. \n\nNow, this is important. Who is the financial advisor for your fund? Meet with them to make sure that your wishes are known. They have a fiduciary responsibility to act in accordance with your wishes but because you\u2019re a minor, your mother or stepfather could try something dishonest. Also expect sentimentality and smarm as they try to guilt you into complying with their wishes. You don\u2019t have to. Again, congratulations, and my very best wishes.", "nta and your mom should be ashamed of herself.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nNo all heroes wear cover", "So,  this is the person your mom chose to marry. Think about that. She chose to let him say crappy things to you without recourse.  She lets it happen.  What a poor excuse for a parent.", "NTA", "While the stepdad and Damon are like the moustache twirling villains of this post, the real problem is actually OP's mom. She should be protecting OP's future and her college fund. She should be standing up for OP when her husband and stepson insult her daughter. She should have intervened on OP's behalf before it got to the point where OP blew up and responded to their baseless bullying with cold hard facts. And she should never call her daughter an asshole for standing up for herself (NTA if it's not obvious).\n\nThe sexist steriotypical stepdad and stepbrother are absolutely assholes, but the mom is an asshole and a failure of a parent.", "This! Word for word!", "Make sure all your info and financials are locked down so they can't access ANYTHING behind your back.", "That money can also be used by OP to sort some student housing situation that allows her to move away from the leeching sexist a-holes in her family, and effectively taking away their chances of putting their greedy hands on her funds.\n\nIf you have the possibility, OP, move those funds to another account only you know about.  \n\n[https://www.tzr.io/yarn-clip/bcea319c-1d48-4556-ae71-ba900f750c1a/gif](https://www.tzr.io/yarn-clip/bcea319c-1d48-4556-ae71-ba900f750c1a/gif)", "NTA\n\nRe-posting my comment because it appears I might have been too harsh and broke some rules. \n\nSo they think they\u2019re allowed to say sexist things to you and you\u2019re not allowed to respond with the truth?  Your step dad is a misogynist and so is your step brother. Don\u2019t give him a penny.\n\nI\u2019m 58 years old and I\u2019m usually shocked at how quickly young people today will go no contact with their parents over things that seem minor to me. But this is big. Your stepdad showed you who he is. I personally would never speak to him again.", "Absolutely this!", "Why on earth would you ever think you were an asshole for standing up for yourself in such a one sided situation.", "... I was making a joke", "So I guess that means that stepbro is smarter than any woman who doesn\u2019t get into an Ivy League school.  And it\u2019s \u201ccollege,\u201d not \u201ccollage.\u201d  Can you even spell?", ">And it\u2019s \u201ccollege,\u201d not \u201ccollage.\u201d Can you even spell? \n\nSuper common autocorrect. You familiar with smartphones?", "You asked me to read through a platform that requires reading.  \n\nAnyhoo\u2026 I\u2019m familiar with smart phones.
