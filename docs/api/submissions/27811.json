The girlfriend is not being unfair bc she had to change plans for a family thing; God doesn\u2019t care whose plan was made first. What no one else seems to be noticing is that OP tells us that he and his girlfriend have a special occasion the following week, and that\u2019s clearly the reason they originally made plans to have food and drinks on Saturday evening. There\u2019s not enough info on what the special occasion is, and so I\u2019m not so crazy as to claim on Reddit that one special relationship day must be a higher priority than a special release day.

Why include the fact that you initially wanted to spend the whole weekend playing? Because you think you deserve credit for agreeing to let one date night interrupt it? Are you digging in your heels now because you think it\u2019s not fair she\u2019s getting everything she wants and you aren\u2019t getting anything you want?\n\nYou\u2019re right that your date could be moved to the following weekend, but the problem here is not one of inconvenient schedule events. It *is* about priorities. For one thing, you are literally prioritizing your prior plan to play over going out with your girlfriend. And like, self care and respecting plans are good things and you are welcome to prioritize them. But don\u2019t lie to yourself. \n\nI\u2019ve seen your replies below saying that there\u2019s no reason she couldn\u2019t go out on Sunday, but I don\u2019t believe you. Your girlfriend has a reason. Who knows what it is. Maybe it\u2019s not as important to her as this release day is to you\u2026 maybe she wants to spend Sunday doing the laundry. Maybe her reason is to prevent you from playing, and if that\u2019s the case then she actually is the asshole. \n\nAnyways. As a gamer who has both played on release days and has also had my release day plans thwarted by the vicissitudes of fate, and as an introvert who doesn\u2019t like going out and socializing, it\u2019s really whatever.", "You both need to discuss your dynamic. Otherwise you should just break up and move on. \n\nHere is the source of this problem. \"She said she has also put the Friday in for leave and thought we could make a day of it.\" She could have easily texted or called to confirm what she was doing. But she only cared for what she thought was important. Clearly knowing you had other intentions. So now you're expected to compromise or just do what she wants. So have a candid chat about your relationship going forward.", "Just take Saturday for your game, no big deal.", "NTA but prepare to be single if you die on this hill", "NTA \n\n\u201cThis is an important time just for me. I hope you also spend Friday doing something you love, just for you.\u201d", "Nta, my husband is a gamer and I am not, but that doesn\u2019t mean that his hobby isn\u2019t important. He takes vacation days to play long awaited games and even if it happens to fall on a date or something else comes up, he gets to choose how he wants to handle it. Honestly it\u2019s nice, because I\u2019ll go do my hobbies or hangout with friends or put my feet on his lap and read, no fuss. It\u2019s nice to say -oh shoot, we made plans months ago, catch the next one- when the \u2018plans\u2019 are actually sitting in our roos and eating our favorite foods not leaving the house for a few days. I would call your girlfriend out on testing you over something stupid that comes down to her not respecting your me time/self care that you planned well in advance. How is she going to sit there and tell you that your priorities aren\u2019t in order when you have planned out your time and she is the one who didn\u2019t and now doesn\u2019t want to be flexible about her lack of communication and planning?! Next weekend would be better all around, which will allow her to actually find something fun to do or make proper reservations", "NTA it's important to you. You've taken time off for it and been hyped for a long time. She can go fck herself if she thinks some random new plans can beat a new game releasing you've been waiting for, and I say this as a female myself if that helps. Smells like she think her wants are more important than your own", "NTA.  Oh, the irony.  \"She accused me of not having my priorities in order....\"  She had plans with you and blew them off for something else, not an emergency.  She is the last person to make that claim.  If you already have plans, you don't cancel them to do something else.  That is just rude.  \"She accused me of being unreasonable....\"  Demanding you be flexible on her whim is the epitome of being unreasonable.  Not sure how long you have been together, but this would make me question her value.", "NTA. You took that day off with specific plans in mind.  Nothing wrong with her asking, but she should respect that you have some time set aside for yourself once you made it clear you didn't want to change your plans.\n\nAnd let me guess, Spider-man 2? I'm also counting down the days.", "YOU TOOK **THAT** DAY OFF ESPECIALLY!\n\nIf you cancel your original plans to enjoy the game during the weekend, you might just as well  cancel your free day and save it for another moment.\n\nNTA\n\nShe knew why you took THAT day off and now she wants to hijack your day!", "I think there is a big disconnect between people who game and those who do not - Some people can spend hours on things like tik tok and others cannot imagine why.\n\nNTA - you made plans that are important to you.

If she had a favorite hobby/pasttime that you did not share, it should be the same.", "NTA my husband takes time off when video games that he wants to play are coming out. I support and respect that. We all need our downtime.", "NTA\u2026why does she need to see family on Saturday?  Why must you change your plans and she not change hers?   And why can you not play your game all weekend if your special occasion is on Wednesday?   It must not be that special to her if she is ok with changing her plans to see family instead.  Then has the nerve to tell you that you must change your plans.", "Nta she knew you had plans and is just mad they are not with her. Everyone who knows me knows when a new game comes out that I'm interested in I am not available for anything outside a Dr appt for at least a week.", "NTA.

Watching my husband play made me SO HAPPY. Because he was happy and I love him. \n\nFind a supportive gf. I would flat out ask her if she\u2019s testing you and let her know you do not like this behavior.

She put in for leave intending to take that day as a couple day because she doesn't approve of you taking a day for yourself to do something she sees as silly.\n\nThe whole point of you taking a day off, presumably, was so you could indulge in the day without being nagged or feeling like you were letting down your relationship.", "NTA\n\nand if you are the asshole then just be the asshole.  You are allowed to be your own priority on occasion!", "NTA, nothing wrong with her asking to change your plans, but everything after you said no is unfair.", "NTA \nWhy is she expecting you to prioritise her over plans you\u2019ve already made, when she has clearly prioritised her family over existing plans with you? Feels like a double standard to me", "NTA  respect works both ways...and she is showing you none for your plans even knowing how excited you have been.  A Gamer would get it, so maybe she isn't a gamer - but she certainly does know you.  NTA", "If plans are so flexible, she can change hers. Her priorities are not your priorities. She needs to get it in order. NTA", "NTA you do have your priorities straight, you wanted the video game the day it was released which is why you took the day off.  You told her what you were going to be doing and now she states she isn't a priority because she at the last minute chose to take the same day off and wanted your undivided attention.  She has some boundary-stomping control issues where your time is concerned versus her time.  Stand your ground", "Why do I suspect she didn't really have a family thing that Saturday until she got in her head that she wanted that Friday you took off to be about her? Her priority is to to manipulate and control you taking away any mental health break or activity you planned for yourself because it doesn't include her. The red flags, they be a waving.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s manipulating you by playing relationship games on a day that you had something planned. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to make you the bad guy while she\u2019s shitcanning your plans.", "NTA. I'm not sure of your ages, but one of the things I love about being older is that I don't need to cling to my husband and I have my own interests. You have plans.

Grab the game and your favorite foods, lock the doors, and have fun!", "NTA, I'm married to a man who has his own favorite games. If one of those games happens to have a release, then I already know I won't be seeing him for at least a day or two but he makes plenty of time for me literally any other time, just like you are trying to do. She's being selfish and would probably be pissed at you for wanting her to reschedule something that was important to her like that. I hope you enjoy your game!", "NTA. The one being inflexible is her.", "NTA. \n\nThere is no reason for you to have to cancel the plans you already have in place because she wants to go to her family's house. Unless it's an emergency or something like that, it doesn't make sense why you should take your day off and weekend to do this. \n\nAlso, she is being quite hypocritical in saying that you are being infelxible because you refuse to change your plans, when you gave her perfectly good alternatives and she shot them down. \n\nEveryone needs their own down time and you chose yours and got the day off for it, she needs to respect that.", "NTA this is a power play on her part. Fight this battle carefully it may set the tone for years to come.", "NTA-If I had to guess she is shit-testing you.", "NTA. This is your time, your hobby.

Can I ask what game it is?", "YTA. what you are basically telling her is that the release of a video game and relaxation is more important than her family, which is objectively wrong. she is entirely right, you need to get your priorities in order and stop focusing on a video game.", "NTA. I don't care if you've been waiting years for an anniversary edition of Tiddlywinks. You made the plans and she knew about it.

Don't let anyone stop you!", "NTA. You made your plan and even took a day of well in advance for it.

He had been dating this girl for about month, nothing exclusive but consistently seeing. Monster Hunter Rise came out for the Switch and he booked off an entire weekend just to play it. He communicated this to her, she apparently understood, but later asked if there was going to be any free time for the weekend to which he said no. Long story short, she did not return any texts after that weekend.\n\nYou're not an AH for making free time for yourself, but I think setting an entire day or weekend off for a video game is enough to put some SOs off and I don't think they're necessarily wrong for walking out.

But this was planned well in advance and was important to him on that day.", "Do you think being in a relationship means you have to cancel your plans whenever your partner tells you to?", "Yeah you're just wrong. \n\nBeing in a relationship doesn't mean you have to cancel your plans when your partner tells you to", "How am I saying its more important than her family exactly?\n\nDo you think being in a relationship means you have to cancel any plans you make when your partner tells you to?", "Why do you think it's sad to have a hobby that I do on my own?\n\nDo you constantly need to be around other people?", ">ut I would never put a game (or hanging out with my friends, or seeing a movie on the day it releases, etc.) over my GF (now wife).\n\nSo you're basically saying you have no respect for yourself or your friends and that your partner is allowed to control when you make plans then\n\nAnd I made the plans first, if I was putting the game over my gf I'd be cancelling plans with her to play the game which isn't what's happening\n\nThe fact you think a mature relationship is doing everything your partner wants and not being able to make plans without your partners permission says a lot about you. You're the one not ready for a relationship, try getting some self respect", ">Obviously he's an adult and doesn't   \n>  \n>have  \n>  \n> to give his GF anytime\n\nPlease explain how me suggesting the Sunday is me not giving my partner any time? \n\nWhy you think people in a relationship are unreasonable for having 1 day to themselves?", ">it's also no surprise that some partners might not stick around as a result - their choice.\n\nDo you think it's reasonable in a relationship to not want your partner to have any time to themselves?", ">He communicated this to her, she apparently understood, but later asked if there was going to be any free time for the weekend to which he said no. Long story short, she did not return any texts after that weekend.\n\nYour friend dodged a bullet. Why do you think adults in relationships are wrong for wanting time to themselves? Do you believe all relationships need to be co-dependent?", "Not surprising, there's a lot of people who are convinced gaming is a waste of time and do everything they can to sabatoge someone's plans for gaming marathons", "I'm the exact same.\nThey're gonna need fifty good men and some heavy machinery to get me off my playstation", "Or Assassins Creed", "Because now that she sees that you are unwilling to budge on a single day for a video game, she's going to now ask herself if this will become a trend with you going forward. You've now sent a very clear message that the video game is the priority and she has to work around it - something you have every right to do but don't be surprised if she walks out on you.", ">True but to choose that rather than go out and interact with real people seems rather strange to me.\n\nSo you think if you have a hobby that you do on your own, you're wrong for doing it?\n\nWhy do you think you should never be on your own?", "Why do you think someone having a hobby they do alone is a bad thing?\n\nWould you not date someone who enjoyed doing things on their own?", "Do whatever you want with your life, but the fact of the matter is that your GF is probably hurt that you've now confirmed that the video game takes priority over her.", "My friend regrets his decision to this day and has never been able to sustain another relationship.", "Lol, way to spin it  to make op the asshole.", "I dont have fifty good men. Will Ramsay Bolton and Ser Twenty of House Goodmen do?", "Do you think being in a relationship means your partner has to cancel their plans whenever you demand?", "There's nothing wrong with doing a hobby that means being on your own but your girlfriend wanted to go out with you but you decided you'd rather stay in and play on a computer. That's what I find strange. You're a grown man, presumably,  and you'd rather play a computer game than go out and interact with your gf.", "Hey, you do you! But if you couldn't give even a part of the day to your girlfriend, don't be surprised if she suddenly has less time for you after this.", "It's not about the video game. Its about the fact I already had plans.\n\nDo you believe in a relationship any plan you make without your partner has to be cancelled when they tell you to?\n\nD", "Your friend will get over it. The girl he was seeing is completely unreasonable.", "The Erymanthian Boar should've been my time to stop - that quest is hell and I could never get it!", ">There's nothing wrong with doing a hobby that means being on your own\n\nSo why do you think I should have to cancel plans to do a hobby on my own when my gf tells me to?\n\nWhy do you find it strange that someone would not cancel plans they made weeks in advance just because their gf told them to?\n\nSo because I'm a grown man, you think I shouldn't be allowed a hobby?\n\nSo why do you think I need to cancel my plans when there is a day where my gf and I are both free? Why should we not pick the day we're both available?", "why do you think being in a relationship means you shouldn't be allowed 1 day to yourself?", "I think a healthy relationship should be able to navigate changes within reason. You've now proven to her that a video game has priority and will likely always remember this decision you make. And honestly, you probably don't have to worry about the Sunday - she'll probably give you the whole weekend to play the game as well as the foreseeable future because I don't think she'll be sticking around.", "It's been two years and no improvement. But sure, blame the girl for not wanting to be put below a video game.", "But you were both available.  Do you really put playing a computer game above the enjoyment of spending a day out and about with your gf? Have you not heard about spontaneity? You asked if you were TA and on this occasion I think you were.  A game is hardly important and to get excited over that I think is just rather sad.", "Again, you do you. And if your GF decides to get gone, guess what? You now have much more free time to game and she won't be bothered by it. A win-win.", ">But sure, blame the girl for not wanting to be put below a video game.\n\nNo I'm blaming her for not respecting that your friend had plans. You seem to think in a relationship spending time on your own is not allowed and you can't seem to answer why", "> He could even wait a week!\n\nSo if I can wait a week, why can my gf not wait until the following weekend for drinks? The bar and restaurants are still going to be there so why should I cancel my plans?\n\nSo you think adults that have a hobby and spend time on it are losers? Do you not think adults should be allowed to have fun?", "There is no way she would say I just need an hour out of your day. \n\nNo adults that do this have busy lives and know they will only get to spend time doing something they enjoy if they book the day off. That's a responsible man, for thinking ahead and scheduling a block of time to play.\n\nWait a week to play...... you having a laugh. You will see and hear too many spoilers. Part of the fun is not knowing the story yet.", ">But you were both available. \n\nNo I wasn't. Please explain how I was available when I had already communicated my plans\n\nImagine thinking its sad that an adult has a hobby. You must live a pretty pathetic life", "So you can't answer the question then", "On the contrary. I think you're describing yours.", "I told you to do you. If you want to prioritize a new game over your partner, go for it! You're an adult, no one is stopping you - just like no one is stopping her from dropping your butt.", "Boomers are people 55-77 currently if you ask Google. So yes you are a boomer! A possible great grandpa by your age. Your actually in the highest age part of that number too.", "Why is taking 1 day to do a hobby you enjoy extreme?\n\nDo you not think adults should be allowed to enjoy their hobbies?", "Nah I'm fine with my life because I understand adults are allowed hobbies.", "Again not answering the question. Why do you think adults should not be allowed to spend time on their when when they're in a relationship?\n\n Try not avoiding the question this time"]}
