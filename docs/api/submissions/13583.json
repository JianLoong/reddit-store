She has rotative shifts. That means one week she has the morning shift, the next the afternoon shift and then the night shift. As the morning shift comes straight after the night shift, she usually has trouble waking up on time to get to work during most of those days she needs to get up early.\n\nWe live together in a rather small apartment, she has a 30 minutes drive to get to work from home. I work every weekday from 9 to 5. \n\nShe has to be in the hospital by 6AM, so she usually wakes up at around 4:30 or 5 to be able to have breakfast before leaving. She likes to have a big breakfast as she doesn't often get to eat anything else until around 2PM when her shifts are over (this depends on the day, sometimes she has free time and other times she doesn't). Picture some coffee, orange juice, bacon, eggs, pancakes (or waffles) and maybe something else like another fruit, cereal or something else. She leaves a big mess every morning with different kitchen utensils dirty, she doesn't get to clean them up because she's running late. \n\nWe moved in together into her apartment when the pandemic started. Back then I didn't had to work (neither go to the office or work from home) for a while, but she had to continue working obviously. So I cleaned up after her when she left. Then I started working from home but the workload was much less then usual, so as I had lots of free time before she got home I cleaned up too. \n\nHowever, now I have to go back to work at the office (have been doing so since the lockdown was lifted). I now wake up around 7 when she has already left. I don't like to eat a lot early in the morning so I usually just have coffee for breakfast, maybe a cookie or some pancakes if my gf left any, but nothing else.  I don't clean my girlfriend's breakfast mess anymore, I just clean my cup and plate if I even use any. We don't have a dishwasher.\n\nSo my girlfriend complained about me not cleaning after her a while ago, like half a year ago or so. She told me it's very discouraging to come home and see every pan dirty because I didn't clean them up when I could easily do it. At the time, I told her that I had to go to work too, so now it's not fair that she just doesn't clean after herself.\n\nEver since, this has been an ongoing conflict between us. This week we had an argument about this again. I came home early because of some accident that happened in my office building. Around 1PM. Then my girlfriend got home and she complained about the dishes still being dirty when I was home. I told her that my cup (I only had coffee that day) was clean and that all of the dirty things were hers. She got very angry and claimed I never help around, which is false. I'm tired of always arguing about the same thing over and over again.

Being a nurse is a demanding job and I'm sure she's running on fumes but you're her boyfriend, not her maid. Not only is she not pulling her weight but she acts entitled and like it is your job to clean up after her. If she lived alone, she would have to do her own dishes like every other adult. Having a job does not absolve you of household duties. You could stop being sorta petty about it though, communicate with her and come to an agreement.", "NTA if she wants a big breakfast and no dishes, she should grab some fast food, or maybe think about some frozen options", "You are NTA. If she\u2019s able to build sufficient time into her schedule to prepare an elaborate breakfast, then she needs to build 10 or 15 extra minutes into that routine to take care of her mess. It was one thing when you were pitching in more because you didn\u2019t have as many responsibilities outside the house, but she can\u2019t expect you to pull more weight because she can\u2019t manage the demands of her schedule.\n\nThis is probably part of a larger discussion, however. It might be time to sit down and map out how much each of you contributes to the balance of household labor (to include the mental/emotional labor of managing it). Who does the laundry? Who does the shopping (grocery or otherwise)? Who does any apartment maintenance? Imbalances in one area can be offset by one of you pulling more weight in another area, but it\u2019s in your best interest to figure out who does what (and how much that contributes to the overall workload of the house).\n\nGood luck!", "NTA, I was ready to defend her because I know that nurses have very little time to themselves, and especially on a rotation schedule (which trust me, is more exhausting than the  job itself) , but for her to make that much work and not clean up after herself is honestly disgusting. (EDIT because I hit enter BY ACCIDENT) If she has that much time, she should manage it better by maybe making simpler meals that will allow her the time to clean. Sounds like she's lazy, or burnt out, and is asking for help, but she's causing the issue herself.", "NTA \n\nShe should clean her own messes. No excuses. She got used to you doing it, but you are both working. What would she do if you didn't live there?", "NTA. It sounds like most days she gets home before you? I don't see why she can't clean her own dishes? Do you guys split the chores evenly otherwise?", "Nta.  That\u2019s pretty rude imo to leave a mess and expect you to clean it up.   I am out the door before my husband gets up.  I don\u2019t eat breakfast but I prepare my lunch in the mornings.  I put everything in the dishwasher before I leave.  I wouldn\u2019t expect my husband to clean up after me.", "NTA .  If she wants to make a big breakfast for herself, it's her responsibility to clean the resultant mess. She can get up an extra 10 minutes early to have time or she can switch to a less messy meal.  You were a saint for cleaning after her in the past when you had free time, but that isn't the case any more.", "NTA\n\nShe should understand that with you going back to work, it might not be sustainable for her to make breakfasts like that.\n\nBut there are plenty of ways to find a solution together. Get a small bowl for the utensils etc to soak so it's much easier to clean if left out. She could clean as she cooks. There is usually plenty of time in between flipping bacon and pancakes to clean as you go. Yeah it kinda sucks when you start but just make it a habit. You'll be surprised how much you can clean while cooking. Also why is she making such a mess for something that only requires a cast iron, and Pyrex measuring cup for mixing.\n\nOr either of you can wake up 10 min earlier and clean. 10 minutes, maybe 5 that's all it takes. Why are you arguing over 5 minutes. Sounds like this I'd actually a deeper conversation about how work/life balance and how you two will navigate this. Because life will only get busier for a bit", "I'm sorry your girlfriend has chosen to work the worst possible schedule. Most hospitals now either do 12 hour straight shifts, or 8 hour rotating but only between two of the 3 possible shifts (D/N, D/E or E/N). Studies have shown that working nights is hell on your circadian rhythm but rotating shifts will do far worse damage. She needs to switch jobs or get a better schedule, or both. A lot of hospitals will pay new hires better ( because they have raised their base rate but haven't retroactively applied it) or by giving a large sign on bonus (USA) because of the worsening nursing shortage. \n\nThat does not mean she needs to clean her own mess. You both need to sit down and communicate about how shared cleaning of shared space will be handled. There are better ways to create a large breakfast without leaving a big mess in the morning. Pancakes can be made ahead of time and then reheated in the toaster. A silicone pan and an air fryer will give quick bacon and can easily go in the dishwasher. As others have said, if she lived alone she would have to clean up after herself. She would have probably worked out how to create breakfast without making such a mess if she hadn't had you there to clean it up. In fact she probably did have a better system before you moved in, then got lazy.", "Buy a dishwasher, they are cheap, better for the environment, and mostly arguments free.", "NTA. It was generous of you to clean up after her when you worked from home, but she shouldn\u2019t have felt entitled to it. Now that it\u2019s less convenient for you there\u2019s no reason you should keep doing it. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re even complaining that it\u2019s left out all day, which would honestly be valid if you did. She needs to start getting up early enough to clean up after herself, or meal prep her breakfasts on the weekend so she isn\u2019t making such a mess.", "Buy a counter dishwasher. They use 5 liters of water and you can get one with a reservoir if you don't want to hook it to the faucet. They can be used as a dish rack or to wash fruit too. NTA.", "NTA. At the very least, her fishes need to be in the sink rinsing. I respect the work she\u2019s doing but not her leaving her mess for you.", "NTA she made the mess", "NTA.\n\nIs it normal to have an early morning shift immediately after a late night shift? That makes absolutely no sense to me, but I realize that very little about the medical world makes sense.", "NTA\n\nWhat would her plan be if she lived alone??", "INFO: does she only leave dirty dishes or does she leave a mess?\n\nI understand not having time to do dishes in the morning. And,  if chores are truly shared 50/50, you shouldn't be making an issue of doing dishes for each other.\n\nHowever, cleaning up after yourself, leaving the share spaces easy to use for the people you live with, is just basic decency. Why doesn't she eat something that takes less time or makes less of a mess?", "NTA\n\nResentments fester.  Unless I'm mistaken, you're feeling devalued by her insistence that doing the morning dishes is somehow your responsibility. And she, has grown accustomed to you doing the dishes and now feels like you not doing them for her is some sort of betrayal.\n\nMight I recommend making breakfast in advance and putting it in microwavable containers?  There's no running late excuse for not doing the dishes before bed.  And mornings would probably work better for you both.", "ESH.  You two need to come to an agreement around who does what.  It doesn't make sense for both of you to do your laundry separately, cook separately, etc.  It sounds like you feel taken advantage of by having to do all the dishes while she sees it as helping her out.  What would make that even for you?  Helping each other is what is going to make things work for you long term.", "YTA.\n\nYou know you're NTA in the situation but are framing the post and using reddit AITA to prove a point.\n\nThen again that's kinda the point of this sub so maybe IATA", "ESH\n\nShe should try to do some cleanup, or plan to cleanup some of her stuff\n\nYou also could help out with some of it some of the time. Not saying every morning, but its a two-way street.", "Both YTA", "ESH\n\nIs there a chore that you do that you absolutely hate that she can take full responsibility for, and dishes just become yours?

But it doesn't sound like you really partake often or much in this big breakfast, so there's no responsibility owed. If you've taken some pancakes, maybe like clean an extra dish or two to compensate, but if she's going to get that weirdly transactional about it, the solution is to just leave her stuff alone.", "NTA.

Same thing goes if she has waffles. Maybe it\u2019s time for her to start buying paper plates and the frozen breakfast items to just heat up. They taste just as good.
