My daughter has specific diapers because she is allergic to the rest. She becomes inflamed and develops rashes and it\u2019s just very uncomfortable for her. I always make sure she has some stocked there. \n\nTwo days ago after I brought her home I noticed my daughter was in different diapers, with a rash already starting. The net day I went to the daycare and complained the teacher apologized. I gave her the ointment my daughter needed, and left.\n\nIt happened again, and it didn\u2019t look like my daughter was given any ointment. She\u2019s in the same wrong diapers. Her rash is worse. Today I went to the school furious. I yelled at the daycare worker and said she needed to learn how to do her job and now my daughters rash is worse because of her. \n\nShe got really upset and asked me not to yell and said it was an accident and she didn\u2019t know where the rest of my daughters diapers were put up, the morning teacher has them put up. I told her that\u2019s when you ask, it\u2019s not fair my daughter is irritated and uncomfortable because she won\u2019t ask.

Yelling at a young new teacher isn\u2019t the answer. Her age also isn\u2019t a huge issue. She could be doing schooling and in need of teaching hours. \n\nYour solution lies with the director, if the director blows you off call the licensing board. This is not okay.", "YTA. You are angry at the wrong person and yelled at a new employee that clearly wasn\u2019t given proper instructions regarding how to care for your child. \n\n\nIt is a bad situation and I definitely feel for you and understand why you are upset but, yelling at a teenager that wasn\u2019t told how to care for daughter isn\u2019t cool. This is an issue for the supervisor of the daycare. And yes, your husband is right, you should find a new one if they can\u2019t meet basic needs like taking care of allergens.", "YTA, but only because you go to a supervisor when this stuff happens. You don\u2019t 100% know who changed her last, and whoever is training the new employee is also a part of this. If baby has an allergy, no one bothers to tell the new person, and no one tells the new person where they keep the diapers you send, they\u2019re being negligent. A clear system for storage and health info  needs to be put into place, and/or they need to not leave a new employee on their own for the first few days. A new workplace with lots of small children could be overwhelming if stuff isn\u2019t organized in an easy to find, easy to remember way. I\u2019m not excusing them for their behavior, but if she\u2019s been thrown into this with the assumption she\u2019d figure it out on her own, and no one has made sure she knows where things are kept, that\u2019s someone higher up failing. Honestly though, you should find a new daycare center, regardless of where this problem stems from. Health and safety should be their number one priority.", "YTA Yelling at a minimum wage worker to the point of tears, geez. You should have asked to speak with the director and I\u2019m sure they would get to the bottom of the issue; no yelling or tears necessary. I hope they kick you out. Start looking for another daycare.", "\"I went to the school furious. I yelled at the daycare worker\". You were in the wrong. This is not an okay way to treat anyone. Your daughter's rash is a serious concern and when it wasn't addressed after you told her about it the first time, you should have communicated what had happened with your daughter's rash, not yelled at the worker. YTA, your husband has perspective on this one, listen to him.  \n\nAlso you wrote \"I 25f have a 14 month old diaper.\" You might want to change that. \ud83d\ude0f", "YTA for yelling at her. You should have spoken to a supervisor and had it arranged that she knows the situation and where the diapers are especially considering she's new. I understand that you're upset and rightly so but you're still wrong for how you approached it.", "Soft YTA just for the yelling. You were right to be upset and you should complain to the management but you don\u2019t get to yell at her. Your reaction takes you into AH territory. You need to either find a new daycare or ask the management what they are going to do to have the incident noted and what they are changing so this doesn\u2019t happened again. You should apologize for yelling at her", "YTA. You yelled at the wrong person here. The morning teacher, who knows your child's needs, and who is the one you complained to, is the one who made a mistake. The new teacher wouldn't know about the special diapers, the diaper issues, or the cream, or even know to ask. I have worked in daycare. Afternoon staff depend on morning staff to share these things.\n\nIf the issue continues, go to the supervisor. There may be an issue with lack of training, an issue with communication between morning and afternoon staff, or even some policy changes that need to happen. Regardless of which, it is not the afternoon teacher's fault, based on the information you provided, and you definitely owe her an apology.", "NTA. She was literally putting your daughter in pain because she was too shy to ask where the diapers had been put? I don't care what age you are, this is unacceptable if you're working at a daycare. You asked nicely the first time, I don't blame you for yelling the second.", "NTA, but you handled it the wrong way, you should have gone to the supervisor and talked to them, instead of yelling at the employee", "NTA. It's completely unacceptable for a childcare provider to ignore a kid's allergy.\n\nYou should complain to her supervisor. (This may be more constructive than confronting her yourself.)", "Yta for how you handled it, nta for being upset about it though", "Don't know why people feel they get better results if they are super rude. No wonder nobody wants to do this job. You don't have to be an asshole just to get your point across, you could have talked to someone in charge to straighten this out. Screaming at a teenager is not the right way to address this.\nYTA", "YTA. From the sounds of it, you blamed the wrong person because she clearly wasn't told where your daughter's diapers were. You mentioned it to the teacher prior, and she didn't communicate with the new girl. \n\nThat being said, i get it is frustrating, so bring it up to the person in charge and talk to them in a civil way and think of a solution so EVERY worker knows. This girl didn't do this maliciously.", "NTA\n\n> My husband says I overreacted and we should just look into new daycares because they shouldn\u2019t have hired someone so young to be a teacher.\n\nNo, that doesn't make any sense.

My child\u2019s was worse as they ended up in the ER\u2026twice with zero accountability from them (1x also never called to tell us our child was covered in hives) Facilities have specific rules to follow for allergies and there\u2019s no excuse. Had this been an allergy that was life/death, the responses would be far different as 1x would have never been acceptable.", "YTA. I am sorry your daughter is suffering with rash, but yelling at an employee is NEVER the answer. How do you not know this?", ">\tI have a 14 month old diaper.\n\nYou might wanna change that.", "YTA simply because you feel yelling at someone is an OK solution. Daycare screwed up, new worker screwed up. It's on you to be mature though.", "YTA-yelling is not how you handle this. You\u2019re way too old to be using that tactic. Plus, it sounds like your daughter heard you yelling which makes this even worse. You are teaching her that this is an acceptable way to handle an issue. \n\nOnce you are calm, be sure you send an email or letter to the Director of the day care center in order to ensure that your daughter\u2019s diapers & ointment are accessible to both teachers.", "YTA\n\nDay care has to be the worst possible job because of people like this. She made a mistake, she apologized, she's new, she's young and likely inexperienced. Help her understand why it is so important. \n\nGood luck finding a new daycare. You likely just find a new set of problems and another reason to yell.", "YTA\n\nI doubt you would like to be screamed at for making a mistake at work.\n\nBe better.", "YTA, OP.\n\nYelling didn't resolve anything, it only escalated the situation and detracted attention away from the issue that really mattered, the child's care.", "NTA. Was your response the most perfectly emotionally-regulated compassionate one possible? No. But you pay the daycare to do one thing: keep your child safe and healthy. They failed to do that. And especially with a tiny human who can\u2019t advocate for herself or tell you what happened that day, it\u2019s your job to advocate on her behalf. I can\u2019t blame you for being upset.", "ESH - yeah she fucked up even when told but not sure yelling at her was right. You should have talked to her superior.", "YTA. You chose to yell at her when the actual issue is that she hasn\u2019t been trained well enough. Go to management and just talk to them. Yelling is an asshole move", "NTA you shouldn't have yelled (if you raised your voice) but i would definitely complain as well.  I dont think you need to apologize to her, I think you should go in and speak to her boss and complain about her and if it happens a 3rd time they should fire her.", "NTA but you might need to take it over that one worker's head. Her negligence harmed your child. How much other harm is she doing carelessly?", "YTA what the hell is wrong with you? Why would you go and scream at someone when you don't even know it's her fault? Maybe she wasnt told about your daughters rash?", "Soft YTA\n\nYou were right about everything except the way you handled it. You made yourself wrong by yelling. \n\nA stern conversation was absolutely warranted. This was extremely negligent and harmful. How would she like to spend a few days with a serious rash down there?\n\nIf you feel like you owe an apology for yelling, then do so. Say, \"I'm sorry for the way that I handled this. I was very upset that my daughter had been hurt by your negligence. But I shouldn't have raised my voice.\"\n\nIt would also be appropriate to talk to the daycare director about this problem. This is a big deal. Any daycare should know to be attentive about children's allergies, especially one as serious as this.\n\nIf you don't feel like the daycare is taking this seriously, or if they are more focused on how you raised your voice than on how they hurt your baby, then you should definitely look into switching daycares.", "YTA for how it was handled. I get that you were upset but that doesn't mean you can just go up to someone and start hollering at them. Think about how you would feel if someone just up and did that to you. Bet you wouldn't like it. So at the very least you owe that teacher an apology for how you acted.", "NTA at all. Their negligence gave a 1 year old baby a rash, and you had already talked to them about it. Educators usually know better than anyone how seriously allergies should be taken. I would just start looking for a new daycare at this point.", "YTA I'm withholding judgment on the daycare worker, as I'm too distant to determine if she careless (which would be her fault) or if she's improperly trained. (which would be the daycares' fault) Either way, yelling her into submission isn't the right way to handle it. Complain to management, switch daycares, or both. While you have the right to be angry at how your child was treated, yelling is how children handle things, not adults.", "YTA\n\nI get being mad. And the first round of angry confrontation. But once the teacher explained, you could have let it go, especially if in the course of the discussion she figured out where the stuff was. \n\nIf you are really upset, take it up with the administrators, which is how *you* should have handled it in the first place.", "YTA", "YTA fucking stay home and watch your kid if this is how you treat people. This is gonna surprise you but your child is not the only one they care for. Also who cares if she's young she sounds more mature than you. Grow up.", "YTA for how you handled the situation, however I don't believe you're the ah for being upset.\n\nThere's a way to protect your child in this type of situation, without making others feel threatened by your presence (which is what is intended when you yell at someone). I'm with your husband,  I would apologize,  then find a new daycare that is better suited for your child's needs. \n\nGood luck", "[deleted]", "NAH - I understand that you are upset for a good reason, but it seems like you are upset with the wrong person. Perhaps the first time it happened no one told her that your child needed special diapers, then they told her but the diapers were not where she could find them, the problem is either with the supervisor who should properly train staff on all childrens' needs, or with the first shift for putting vital supplies in an unobvious place.", "Info:\n>The net day I went to the daycare and complained the teacher apologized.\n\nIs the teacher you complained to the morning teacher or the afternoon teacher?", "Mostly YTA. Yeah, she shouldn\u2019t have put your daughter in the wrong diapers, and she should have asked where they were. But personally, I would expect my boss to tell me where the diapers were if they were going to leave (it is also important to note here that I\u2019m autistic and that might not be something everyone needs). Also, it doesn\u2019t sound like the other worker was even there, so I have no idea how she would have been able to ask where the stuff was. Yelling at someone is never a good way to handle a situation.", "NTA. She\u2019s a teenager she probably has a smart phone to take notes on. Now your daughter has a diaper rash because she was neglected. Technically speaking it\u2019s neglect. You can apologize yes. But don\u2019t buy her anything. She IGNORED easy directions. I\u2019d be furious to if simple instructions where overlooked and my kid ended up getting a rash. Na this girl can\u2019t ask a simple question to know where the diapers are ? Na. She shouldn\u2019t be working here if she can\u2019t handle taking care of kids and the things they need. Apologize yes. But don\u2019t buy her anything. Besides what if it happens again? If it does then it\u2019s child neglect.\n\nIf it does happen again you probably could press charges for child neglect. Day cares hate looking bad to the public. \n\nI\u2019d start looking for a new place that has experienced workers.", "NTA\n\nShe apologized the day before, meaning she understood the problem, and didn't use the diaper rash creme!
