It's a funny mistake, you laughed. From your description you weren't taunting him and you apologised!\nI think they'll get over it.. eventually", "NAH.\n\nI get your coworker was embarassed but I'd say you were laughing more at the situation than your coworker. I think remembering a bewildered look in a customers face would set me off as well.\n\nI can also understand him taking it a little personally but it wasn't like you were pointing directly at him and laughing either, they've just misunderstood what was making you laugh. Considering you tried to apologise to them for hurting their feelings you're absolutely not an AH.\n\nIf he's still cold in the future it may be worth trying to explain it wasn't him you were laughing at but the circumstances just so they know your giggling wasn't solely due to their mistake.", "NTA. He created a lot of extra work for you, so it'd be nice if he could at least laugh at the situation a little with you. I sure would!", "NAH \n\nFunny situation, yah he was embarassed in a couple days it will be funny again. Unless he is a second language or hard of hearing in which case it was an unfortunate misunderstanding.", "No your not an asshole. Slap Happy, that\u2019s what it is called when you are overly tired and get the giggles or laugh repeatedly. Look it up, print it out and take the paperwork and show it to him. It is an actual side effect. It just doesn\u2019t often happen.", "You got even more to do putting all the flowers back, but you found the humor in it, NTA", "it was a genuinely funny event and you even tried to apologise to him. NTA", "nTA, you were laughing at the misunderstanding, not your coworker or the man.", "NTA\n\nThis is a silly mistake that was quite funny. Laughing at it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.", "NTA, I'm laughing about it now.", "NTA. Listen. I have literally laughed out loud....belly laughed at this story. And then I thought of it again and laughed. I keep picturing you and your coworker getting all these flowers out and then the confused customer. And THEN you picturing it and laughing. This is the best story.", "After a certain point it stopped being a joke you were both in on and became you laughing at his mistake . Which is an honest mistake. There are boundaries to these things. Let time pass so the sting of embarrassment isn\u2019t so fresh before you laugh. YTA", "Soft YTA, it\u2019s good that you two could laugh over the situation at first but this was clearly an embarrassing situation for him, and you continuing to laugh would have felt condescending to him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA", "NTA, I would have been laughing as I watched him put all the flowers back. You were nice enough to restock everything after coming back from your break early.", "NTA. In a situation like this, the only thing to do is to laugh. Otherwise you might be crying over all the extra work, it created.", "Well. If I was you I\u2019d be in stitches. I would be cackling witch style. For hours. Days. Weeks. \n\nSo of course you\u2019re NTA. Then again I could just be a massive AH and if that\u2019s the case then you can join my club. \n\nHonestly I think people take themselves way too seriously. I did find that funny and it would be great if your co-worker could just put the ego aside and learn to laugh a little more", "NTA.  It was funny.  Chalk it up to the stress of the holidays and tell him you're sorry for upsetting him.  I'm sure he was embarrassed at his mistake but it is really funny.", "Nta", "This happened to me so much in high school. I was lucky my teachers were cool because every day during the very last class I just found everything hilarious.", "Eh. It was an honest mistake and deserved a laugh. I'm sure he's embarrassed over his mistake but my bigger question is why didn't the customer speak up sooner? Watching you do all that work I'd be confused.", "NTA. \u201c68 weeks?! No, I said 6 to 8 weeks.\u201d Lol he will get over it soon enough. Mistakes happen, no harm no foul.", "Hmmm\u2026 what kind of flowers say \u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you feel bad, sometimes a situation is just so silly that you have to laugh, but it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault and you don\u2019t need to feel embarrassed, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve made similar mistakes in my time\u201d? \n\nNTA, hopefully things will calm down soon!", "This happens all the time and it\u2019s always hilarious. U don\u2019t know just how many times I watched a cashier run to the back and yell \u201cI ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE 100 BUTTON INSTEAD OF 10!!!!\u201d \n\nShit happens, he just has a small ego. If it bruises that easy, he\u2019s gonna have a tough life ahead of him. U gotta learn to let ur stupid mistakes go and laugh at them", "NTA.  he should feel lucky that you choose to laugh instead of getting angry", "I'm going to be laughing about this all day, and maybe tomorrow. It feels like one of those silent movie skits. \n\nNTA, I get he was embarrassed but you weren't trying to be cruel. I hope you can both talk it out.", "NTA\n\nIdk why he would do that, it is funny. Its not even like you were angry at him, laughing is better than anger. This is the type of story I'd save to tell future coworkers lolol", "He should be happy u dont spit him out for making u lose ur break and do useless work.\n\nHe should apologize to you.", "NAH. That's legitimately funny.\n\nIt's also a rookie mistake. A simple clarifying question would have erased the confusion. \"How much were you looking to spend?\"", "NTA. I can understand his perspective because I have RSD (rejection sensitive dysphoria), but he easily could've communicated his feelings and cleared up the issue by saying, \"I feel like you're laughing at me. Is it me that you're laughing at or the situation?\"\n\nMiscommunications and misunderstandings can be funny. You're valid for laughing, and his feelings are valid, too. But it's his responsibility to communicate that he feels like he's being judged or made fun of so that you can be given the chance to explain yourself. It was unfair and unreasonable of him to bottle it up and lash out.", "NTA.", "Same here. But there was also weed.", "Your coworker can piss off, since he can't understand simple instructions or take a joke!", "NTA you were laughing at the situation. No harm done."]}
