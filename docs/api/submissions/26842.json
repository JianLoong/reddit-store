Cheaters rarely change.", "NTA it's not your half-siblings fault, but understandable that you don't want contact. Your dad hurt you and your mum deeply and you are still hurting. Him allowing his kids to harass you is just grinding salt into the open wounds.", "complete utter NTA and he is a complete utter ass. block is number. one point for thought so: his kids are not responsible. they werent involved in the cheating and not in treating you like you are non existend. be polite to them. i dont say have a relationship or sibling love. just be polite. they will learn later why you probably hate them. now they dont get it. kudos for blowing up at dad not the kids", "NTA, why not do a very accurate public post about the event? Sperm donor does not deserve any grace. Is he looking for a babysitter?", "Yeah, I had to try not to. I wasn't even angry at her really. Just angry about what was being asked. But the anger is for him so I gave it to him. Since I blame him for all this mess.", "NTA. Kid, you're terrific! What he did to you was unforgiveable.\n\nWhy is he so interested in contacting you now, though? Normally, when an estranged relative  crawls out from under his rock, he wants money. Or free childcare for his kids. He doesn't sound like the sort of man who would feel guilt for his bad actions.\n\nAnyway, stay frosty!", "NTA, while your are not mad at the half sibling they are old enough to understand grasp the concept of boundaries and what is going on somewhat. While letting your father have it must have felt great it fell on deaf ears because all he cares about his new family and that was proven to you the day he left you stranded. The next time the kid calls gently tell them that you are not here for a relationship with them and tell them its because of their parents and the hurt that they put on you. After that I think its wise of both your mom and to to block your father and the kids number because clearly they have no concern for you feelings what so ever and only think of themself.", "YTA (soft) and at the same time NTA.  Hear me out on this.  You have someone (your 1/2 sibling) who is reaching out to you for no other reason than to have a relationship with you as a sibling.  That alone can be a great thing (or a terrible thing depending on how it goes), but in your anger at your father, you are completely cutting this person out.  Now, as far as your father goes, yes, he's reaping what he's sown.  NTA on that count as this is the situation that he's created and your reaction to him and how you view him are completely justified.  That being said your 1/2 sibling didn't ask to be in the middle of all of this and made a gesture to reach out and you slapped their hand away for no other reason than they're your father's child.  Well, you are also your father's child so no matter how you feel this is something that you have in common whether you like it or not.  How do you know if this person reveres your father or has the same feelings as you and is simply looking for someone who understands where they are coming from?  At the very least a meet up for coffee or something to start and THEN decide on the relationship with your 1/2 sibling may be worth your time (all of this is based on what was shared in the post, if there are extenuating circumstances shared later in the thread I haven't read them, this is just my .02 on the topic based on what you've shared).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; NTA for how your dad treated you, while at the same time soft YTA for not at least listening to what your 1/2 sibling has to say in reaching out to you.", "NTA. Your sperm donor doesn't get to say who is or is not YOUR family. He made his choice, and it was the other people. He tore up his family, but has apparently been filling his children's heads with fairytales about you, and encouraging them to pursue the dream he has of everyone loving him, because he's such a great dad.", "Nta", "Normally, when someone is excessively rude, I'd rule YTA.  But, it feels like your Dad knows where he stands and what he's done and has plenty of time to ruminate on all of it...AND, perhaps more importantly, has not actually made ammends for anything.  Additionally, you didn't take any of this frustration out on the daughter that is trying to get to know you, so props for keeping it focused on that one that's wronged you.  ...gotta go NTA here...", "NTA. It's not fair to you and honestly it's not fair to your 1/2 siblings. One day when they get older they will contact you and hopefully you won't be as harsh with them as you are with your dad, even though he definitely deserves it. There's no relationship because of your dad's actions.", "Right? That kid is almost the age that OP was when his dad abandoned him at school in the rain without making any backup plan then decided to use that opportunity to announce that his affair partner was pregnant at the worst possible time. If Dad thinks that his daughter is too young to hear this story then why did he think OP was old enough to live through it? \\~Or\\~ if he doesn't want OP telling the kid the truth then he can find a way to stop her from calling.", "No, No, No!  I think we can all agree that the father is an AH but his child is innocent.  Hurting the child to get back at the father is petty and just plain wrong.", "Next time she calls, simply tell her \"when I was just a little older than you, your dad forgot all about me and left me alone outside school in the rain for an hour before someone noticed I hadn't been picked up, repeatedly ignored calls from the school, and has never apologized. I want nothing to do with him, so please stop calling.\"", "Fair enough, I was picturing this more as an ultimatum to the father to get him to parent his daughter: \"find a way to stop her from calling. You were a terrible parent to me at that age, and you're a terrible parent to both of us at the moment because either you're supporting her harassing me without explaining any context for why we have no relationship or you're not supervising your 9yo. Nip this in the bud before this hurts her the way it hurt me.\" \n\nBecause even if OP didn't explain the situation to the kid, she sounds like she'd keep digging and there's a point (probably when she's a little older) when she'll figure it out or someone will tell her.", "I'd go further if she keeps calling, let daddy explain to the kid what a homewrecker is and why he abandoned Ops mom. It's not up to op to keep the girls spotless image of her parents alive.", "Yeah,  you're probably right. OP should share the entire story. Maybe dad will see it as \"petty and ungrateful\" enough to accept the NC and stop trying to get his kids together."]}
