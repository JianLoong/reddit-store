Its a fixer upper and it isnt quite what we wanted but it ticked the boxes. The vendor said they were eager to be gone, there was no chain, they were going to rent while they looked for a new place in their new city. They accepted our offer. We shook hands and hoped to be in by September. \n\nWe started the process and everything was going well until after the survey when they couldn't produce all the necessary certificates. We started chasing with our solicitor every week. Nothing. \n\nWe explained that as we live in military quarters on an overflow arrangement, we can be evicted from our home with 30 days notice at any point. We explained our mortgage offer would expire soon. We explained we have family visiting from abroad to help with childcare during the move but they won't be here forever. We begged to close for the last week of October. They assured us via the estate agent it would happen. But our solicitor got nothing.\n\nRadio silence. No sale. They refused to close. Eventually their solicitor told ours they had entered a chain and there were issues further down the line. The seller didn't want to close on their house til it was resolved. They were stalling deliberately. We missed our October window. We had no recourse to make them follow through. \n\nMy husband and I started looking again. On the day it was listed, we saw a house that suited our needs better and asked to view. It was perfect. The price was the same. We made an offer and the buyer accepted. We pulled put of the previous sale for this one. \n\nSuddenly the original vendor is blowing up our solicitor's phone because we wrecked the whole chain. They offered to close next week to keep the original sale but we already agreed to buy this other property which honestly works better for us. But I can't stop thinking about how many families we might have screwed with this.

Something is off with Either the property or contractor or both. Sounds like you dodged a bullet. Good luck on your new home and congratulations!!", "NTA. They didn't act in good faith by maintaining communications with you and left you in the dark as to what was going to happen. You made the best call you could with the information you had. Maybe they'll be more professional next time.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't screw over any families.  You kept to the original agreement.  The seller did not.  The problem is of the seller's making.\n\nEnjoy your new home.", "NTA\n\nIf I am reading this right, you guys repeatedly tried to stay updated with what was going on on their end of the sale and they practically ghosted you for a while. Not only that but why is it only when you guys decide to pull out of the sale that they can suddenly rush the process instead of when you needed it at the end of October?", "NTA. \n\nThis is a business transaction. Pure and simple. A house isn't sold until its sold and anyone can back out anytime as long as they follow the contract rules.", "NTA Real estate deals fall through all the time. The sellers dragged their heels and found out the hard way.", "NTA and it sounds like you dodged a bullet. Something is up with that other seller, you don't just string along people like that during a home sale.", "Nope, same thing happened to us. We where rushed to buy due to other commitments and the owners pulled a similar stunt. After our offer expired we found our dream home ( Solid brick and stone with 3 times the land) and they tried to bind us to the then expired contract.", "NTA.  They refused to negotiate or set a closing time with you.  So naturally you moved on.", "What\u2019s a chain?", "It\u2019s not your fault they chose not to close the deal, nta", "NTA.  They screwed you over so you found another place to buy.  Too bad, so sad for them.", "Nta they chose to ignore your offer, they chose not to respond to you. They were screwing you around hoping you would wait on them. They screwed up.", "NTA extremely poor behaviour on their end, if they wanted to be rid of it so bad why stall.", "NTA and it definitely sounds like you dodged a bullet. Something fishy is going on there. Enjoy your new home!", "NTA they basically ghosted you til you didnt wanna pay for something you couldnt even get if I understand what they are missing.", "NTA - you didn't screw any families over.  The other family screwed themselves over by thinking they could do whatever they wanted to and not respect the other parties involved.  You were present and being proactive.  They dragged their feet and couldn't make up their minds.  It's them, not you why this happened.", "NTA, the classic case of FAFO.", "NTA go with the house that suits you better. You gave the other one enough chances. Not your problem any longer.", "No, you aren't TA.  \n\n\nThey delayed too long, and you exercised your right to pull out of the deal.  \n\n\nThey can all GFT.", "NTA. As long as you followed the rules of your contract, you have done nothing wrong. Had they not been assholes themselves, they could have completed their house sale months ago. They failed to follow through, and they are now reaping the consequences thereof.", "NTA. They were holding things up while you were communicating with them. You eventually took your money elsewhere and they are the only ones to blame.", "NTA\n\nI'm a lawyer (although I'm currently working in a different field), there was something fishy about that behaviour. They'd probably planned to blackmail you accepting a higher pricetag. \n\nI guess you dodged a bullet.", "Dems da brakes, NTA", "NTA. By entering a chain, they tried to change the terms of the agreement w/o your consent.", "NTA, it's business.", "NTA\n\nYou waited four months.  That's long enough.  If the seller couldn't buy their next house because this sale fell through, they should have made more effort to close the sale to you.", "I was guessing that they may not have had the certificates of occupancy for everything and that was one of the reasons for the delay.  Ie you are better off that this one fell through", "NTA", "NTA - If they wanted to close with you they had the opportunity. Good luck, and enjoy your new home!", "NTA, sounds like the person you were originally trying to buy from is out of contract and you\u2019ve tried to work things out. They are the AH not you.", "NTA  You didn't screw over any families.  The seller of the original property did that all by themselves.  They assured you it wasn't part of a chain.  They lied.", "NTA\n\nNo further explanation required frankly.", "Nta, they were hoping for more money and more offers really, I have seen it happen twice via my sister in the last two years, she put in an offer, the buyers accepted but then stalled and when closing came and went found it being sold to someone else.  My best guess is they thought they had someone else on the hook and it fell through and suddenly you were gone as well, don't feel bad, they gambled and lost", "I think NTA If I understand correctly you had an agreement to buy a house but the seller was stalling because they had a problem with the house they wanted to buy, and didn't want to close with you until they were able to close on their new house? If that's the case then they should have been transparent with you and explain what was going on if they expected you to give them a chance to get their next houses stuff straightened out first. The didn't keep you in the loop, you had every right to move on to a better house!", "NTA. I once pulled out of a house purchase on Christmas Eve and blew the whole chain. I don't feel great about it, but it was the right thing to do, as it was for you.", "Info: What does \"no chain\" mean?", "What do you mean by chain? I keep thinking like a chain restaurant but that doesn\u2019t seem right", "NTA they fucked around and found out \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Fuck around \u27a1\ufe0f Find out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They totally are.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU haven't screwed anybody there - THEY acted shady and crashed the deal.", "NTA. Pun intended : The vendor was jerking your chain with lies, deception and procrastination. They FAFO. Congratulations on your new house!", "NTA Also what is the chain they speak of.", "NTA \n\nIt was a business transaction that has now proven insufficient to your needs. Sellers cannot give radio silence and still exist amicable buyers", "NTA, you didn't screw them, either they or the vendor screwed them by blatantly lying \"they were eager to be gone there was no chain\" followed by \"they had entered a chain\" so either they weren't that eager to be gone or they lied about the chain.  If they wanted to not have people pull out all they had to do was be honest in their listings.", "They were the ones who were docking you about. If they had been honest about the chain in the first place, you may have been able to rearrange your timeline. But they weren\u2019t, so you owe them nothing.", "NTA. The seller didn\u2019t care if you got screwed over, why should you care if they do?", "Nope, completely NTA. They screwed you around and now are reaping the consequences.", "NTA They took the risk of losing the deal by not adhering to the contract. Now they all have to deal with the consequences", "NTA. If they didn't settle on time, and you're legally in the clear, this is how house purchases work. Especially in cases where there's a whole chain of purchases happening at the same time, this is a risk that everyone takes. Their solicitor will have told them repeatedly what risk they were taking by stalling with you (to cover their own rear end). In the end, you only screwed the people who very obviously were uninterested in how they were screwing you.", "NTA\n\nThis is business you don\u2019t owe anyone anything", "NTA. Real estate falls through ALL THE TIME before closing for all sorts of reasons. Nothing is final until signatures on closing day and everyone who buys/sells houses knows this. As long as you put in your offer in good faith and left the contract legally (both which you did!) - don\u2019t spend a second thinking about this.", "NTA they were being shady and non-responsive.", "NTA they are acting incredibly suspicious. Like you said you found a better place. You don\u2019t owe them shit when you\u2019re making the biggest purchase of your life, and especially when they play stupid games like this. They fucked around and found out.", "Nope haha fuck them. They didn't care about how they were screwing you and what if they just ditched you after wasting your time.", "It ain't over till closing, every reasonable person knows that. This dude wasn't.", "NTA", "NTA The original seller was deliberately delaying the process so they wouldn\u2019t be inconvenienced even though they had been notified that you were on a tight timetable. You pulling out was a risk they knew was possible and went ahead with trying to delay everything. Hopefully they\u2019ve learned not to do this to someone else. Enjoy your new home and don\u2019t let them bother you. If necessary block them and their solicitors and threaten legal action if they continue.", "NTA! They were quite deliberately screwing you over with the delays. You didn't wreck anyone's plans, they did.", "NTA \n\nthey messed you about so the reaped the consequences, this is on the original vender. You screwed over no one.\n\ngood luck in your new house,", "NTA-sounds like you bent over backwards to complete the sale and they only cared for their own convenience. It is unfortunate that other families were possibly impacted but it still doesn\u2019t fall in your lap.", "NTA\n\nThey played a highstakes all in game of fuck around and find out and lost everything.\n\nNow theyre mad that they fucked around and lost the deal", "Nta, it sounded kinda shady. When all of the parties are interested in a deal it would get done quick. Buying my house took like a week from 1st visiting it to signing papers (was mostly because then was 1st available notary appointment). Also congrats on the new home \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA. That's part.of business. The first homeowners FA&FO. They wrecked their one sale, not you. Up until close you always have the option to pull out and it's best to do so if the seller plays games like that. No telling what problems they are trying to hide.\n\nGo for the second home. Don't even give the first ones another thought. They will have other opportunities to sell the house to the next buyers.", "NTA. \n\nI had a seller try to push my purchase date back. They were having trouble closing on their new house. I had my agent offer to close and then rent it back to them. They closed and moved in with a friend for a few weeks, storing their furniture. It stressed me out just hearing about this, I can imagine what you went through. Not cool on their part.", "NTA - house buying is stressful, but soon you will be glad you did not pursue the first house.  Hopefully your solicited has your back", "Something is real sus about this, NTA at all.  Not sure how they were so surprised when they were the ones wasting time. It\u2019s almost funny they thought y\u2019all would just roll with it, but not really.", "I'm thinking you dodged a bullet. NTA", "NTA- So I had to look up a property chain, which means there was more than one party trying to buy but some of the buyers were trying to sell their own place before buying a new one. Looks like you lucked out by finding a new place since it seems like the sellers were trying to see who were trying to play the waiting game to see if anyone would up the buying price. They can do that just as much as you can find a new place to buy without all the games.", "NTA.  They snooze, they loose.     \nPeople cannot expect to cost you time & offers, cause you stress, increase your legal fees & push you to the brink & then go oh you\u2019ve moved on, no wait I will fix it now.", "NTA You had a good faith arrangement and the seller strung you along until he realized he was going to lose the sale.", "It's when one house sale is contingent on another house sale. So like when someone is wanting to buy a new house but must wait on their current house sale to finalize.", "What is a chain?", "To add, chains can be long!  It could be 3 houses, but it could be many more.  One thing goes wrong with purchase/sale of 6 out of 20 and you are number 14, you don't know what the f is going on, but you get usually screwed.", "\u201cA chain, when used in reference to the process of buying or selling a house, is a sequence of linked house purchases, each of which is dependent on the preceding and succeeding purchase. The term is commonly used in the UK.\u201d -Wikipedia\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(real_estate)", "Thank you very much for explaining!"]}
