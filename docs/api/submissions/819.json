Due to the title company waiting 3 days prior to close date to get the payoff amount on the sellers loan, they were surprised to found out a government agency was backed up with requests and it was taking 3 weeks to process all new requests. The sellers agent then told the seller that the delay was on our end and they wanted to pull out.

But if say there's a problem with the sale of house B, then this will affect the chain in both directions - they can't buy house C until they have the money from house B, and the people from house A can't move because house B isn't available yet.\n(of course some people might get a short term rented place instead of moving straight from one house to another - or you might get an additional loan so that you can pay both mortgages for a few months - but they're both expensive options)", "It's simply you're selling a house, buyer is selling theirs to pay for yours, their buyer has a house for sale, and so on.
