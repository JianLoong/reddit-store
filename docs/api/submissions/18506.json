Today was apparently a tough day, she worked an 8 hour shift and was basically the only one doing the orders. I was 10 minutes late (I\u2019ve been late a few times no more than 15 mins) but she had to work an extra 10 today anyway so she walked out as I was pulling in. She got in the car looking exhausted and started asking why I was late, I explained that I technically wasn\u2019t since she finished later and she got annoyed. We\u2019d had this argument last week when I was about 15 minutes late and she was upset because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to spend more time at work than she already has to\u201d. So this time she keeps asking over and over if Im going to try to be on time and I explained that she\u2019s lucky we drive her.  She said it\u2019s not that hard to be on time since I \u201cdon\u2019t do anything all day\u201d and I told her to stfu or I\u2019m not helping her pay for the trip she\u2019s been saving for (I was originally going to give her 1000$ to pay for most of her flights but she payed it instead and told me I could just give her the 1k when I can) she said \u201cyou already said you\u2019d help. you can\u2019t do that\u201d I said \u201cso then shut up\u201d again and she threw a fit before getting out of the car and walking the rest of the way.

Does she have special needs? Is she eligible for disability transportation? A parent has a responsibility to prepare their child to be independent, that includes driving. Number 3.
