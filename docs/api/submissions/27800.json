Pain and suffering can be managed.\n\nAt this point, since your father CAN make his own decisions, neither you or your brother are correct or righteous in the way you are approaching your father\u2019s illness. The decision for treatment sits solidly with your father. Both of you are disrespectful if you haven\u2019t procured his decision, in writing, witnessed by his health care provider.\n\nI want you to understand what a dying person can go through when there is unfinished business, like two brothers at odds with each other.

This is why many people request to be DNR. \n\nI know you care deeply for your father, but I've also personally seen many cases where a patient's suffering was prolonged against their wishes just because the family couldn't let go.

Find out what he wants, bc if he is near death, he might prefer hospice where he can be given morphine for the pain and he can gently slip away instead of violently fighting an unstoppable death. My grandmother was in that situation and I remember her labored breathing and how \"actively\" she was dying. The way she sounded, and writhing around in her hospital bed, made me think of a horse running a race - which is not a dignified, peaceful death - and my mother swore that the next grandparent wouldn't be put thru that. So the next one did hospice and morphine and he passed peacefully. His kidneys were failing. He tried dialysis but said it was awful. \n\nTalk to your dad and respect his wishes, even if you disagree.
