Based on the wording of your post, you selfishly don\u2019t care what your father\u2019s wishes are, you want him to live, no matter if his quality of life is poor. The majority of medical treatments for severe diseases(cancer, COPD/emphysema, liver failure, etc) are not easy on a young person, but they\u2019re even harder on an older person. Many elderly patients I see are being pushed by family to get treatments like chemotherapy etc, and some of those who are able say they wish the family would just let them be-they have lived a good life and hurt already, why make what\u2019s left of their lives even harder and more painful. Decisions should be made on QUALITY OF LIFE, not quantity. If treatment might give a year or two more of life but is painful or hard on a person, not allowing that person to enjoy what\u2019s left of their life, what kind of life are they living? Would it not be better to have a few days/weeks/months to enjoy your family and time and slip away relatively peacefully instead of struggling and hurting for a few years and not enjoying that time?", "NTA  You want to help your dad get better, your brother wants to help your dad to an early grave so he can inherit.  Now thing about it: Who is the A-hole here?  Could it be your greedy, selfish, manipulative brother?  Or, could it be you who wants your dad to get the help he needs and deserves so he can live longer?", "NTA but you need to go through the checklist of when and what your father wants treatment wise. I think power of attorney id a good idea unless your father doesn\u2019t want treatment. He should know his eldest son did not want to treat him. A lot of elderly people suffer because the doctors are obligated to drag it out unless a medical directive is filled out.  I\u2019m not a senior but I do not ever want to get a feeding tube. Why? After I saw my grandpa suffer for years, beg us to let him die while he was bed bound unable to swallow from a stroke. So it is time to get this sorted.  A feeding tube is to hard to get the doctors to stop so you can die.", "Where did that come from?  I didn't see anything about what the father was suffering from, if he was terminal or much of anything else.  If he's terminal, he still gets to make his own decisions.  I'm a huge supporter of home hospice but you seemed to have made some huge assumptions.", ">Not sure if he's being callous to be greedy\n\nHe is. By saying \"I don't want you to spend my inheritance\", what he means is \"I want money more than I want Dad!\".", "Op said he\u2019s 78 and has organ failure.", "I'd bet he was talking to dad about giving HIM power of attorney.", "Is brother really being heartless or is he trying to respect dad\u2019s wishes and allow him to die peacefully instead of forcing treatments upon dad that may be hard and painful just for a little bit of time as it sounds like OP wants to do? If OP is being unreasonable and saying they want to keep dad alive no matter what, of course money is going to come up. That doesn\u2019t make brother an asshole.", "And I wouldn't be surprised if he get ghosted by his gf once the dad passed away and they get their inheritances...\n\nSeem like OP is willingly to take a mortgage out and pay it off if he has to for dad's care, while OP's brother don't give a damn and wants to hurry up his death...", "So?  Some people do recover from that and as long as he is mentally competent, it's HIS decision.", ">Is brother really being heartless?\n\nYes, he is. We don't know what father's wishes are, but the default assumption is that a person would wish to keep living. \n\n>of course money is going to come up\n\nIt shouldn't come up! Bringing it up absolutely makes brother an AH, and an irredeemable one at that. \"Don't spend Dad's money to keep him alive! I want that money for myself! I insist you let Dad die so I can just take his money!\"", "There use to be a saying in Medicine :\u201dPneumonia  is an Old Man\u2019s  friend \u201c .\nSounds like that Doctor was taught that .Also sounds like he cannot fathom being old himself one day \u2026", "Sure, but at 78 that\u2019s a brutal recovery. You\u2019re right, it\u2019s his decision but OP doesn\u2019t seem to care.", "a lot of people who have dementia don\u2019t have a good quality of life-they are angry, confused, combative, isolated, etc. It sounds like the commenter\u2019s father is not this way, as they describe him as a happy man. No one can ever know what the thoughts of the doctor were, but if the dad were angry, confused, so on, the doctor might have been thinking of quality of life over quantity. If someone with dementia is obviously not enjoying their life anf has made their wishes known, there are times where not treating an illness and letting them slip away peacefully and relatively pain free might be what that patient would have wanted. It\u2019s always on an individual basis, with quality of life being valued over quantity."]}
