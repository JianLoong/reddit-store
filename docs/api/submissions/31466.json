She can mourn without doing so in front of the people who actually gave this man a passing filled with caring and love.\n\nExplain to your eldest that if she wishes to do so, his mother is perfectly capable of arranging her own memorial with the boys and whomever else she might wish to invite.  You aren't keeping her from grieving, but can't bear to watch her cry when you feel she abandoned her husband in his  time of need.\n\nI recommend that you also explain to your sons, when it is age appropriate, that their mother divorced their stepdad so she wouldn't have to care for, or pay for, his medical care; that she received her fair share of assets at the time of the divorce, and that it would be best if they use their inheritance to benefit their own life goals.  Explain that the money should be used for things like advanced education, a down payment for a future home purchase, etc... not to just give away to anyone who didn't know or didn't support Stepdad in his time of need.  That would include not giving money to Mom, but also not giving it to a SO or using it to buy drinks for their buddies.", "NTA obviously.

You and your wife are saints.", "NTA for banning her, but YTA for how you spoke to your son.", "NTA! But going off on your son wasn't okay. What he asked of you was an innocent request, you could have politely declined it rather than resorting to name calling.", "YTA\n\nOh, not for excluding Diana from the ceremony--that's probably for the best for everyone else \\*and\\* for her, given how people who knew them both likely view her... but don't speak poorly of her to the older son--and good God, don't tell him to \"watch his mouth\" when he expresses disagreement with you over a moral and ethical question.  That's ugly.\n\nWhile you're right to use Christopher's final days as an exercise in compassion, it's also worth turning some of that compassion onto Diana, who has done a horrible thing and must live with the consequences.  But despite having been married to her, you don't fully know her heart, her situation, or the rationales for her decisions.  Divorcing him at the outset may have been less cruel than neglecting him, for instance.  And medical bills aren't anything to sneer about, either.  It's easy from the outside to say \"she should've just accepted it!\" when medical debt is the number one cause of bankruptcy in the US (assuming you're in the US).  Should she have just accepted losing her house?  Possibly losing her ability to care for her kids?\n\nAnd oh, lord, caregiving is awful.  My grandmother died just over a year ago, and I watched my mother take care of her.  It's soul-draining work.  Diana might have known herself well enough to know that she simply couldn't do that.\n\nNow, all that said, I couldn't cut someone I loved off.  I've been married over 23 years now, and if my husband is dying, as we all will at some point, I will love him and do my best (although I'm definitely NOT the caregiving type, either).  But I'm not going to judge someone with school-age children and a fear of bankruptcy for saying that she can't do it and noping out of there early in the diagnosis.  I pity her, that she couldn't find the strength within to help him through it.  But I'm neither in her mind nor her shoes.\n\nAnd neither are you.\n\nNot saying that you should welcome her with open arms and include her in the ceremony, but treat your kids with the compassion you're trying to instill in them and say that you don't think it would be appropriate given how Diana and Christopher parted.  And don't degrade their mother to your children, even if you think she's behaved badly.  Compassion is a beautiful virtue, but it's not genuinely compassion if you only apply it to people you personally deem worthy of it.", "NTA sounds like the only good to come out of this relationship were the kids. While minding someone's end of life care is not for everyone, it doesn't mean you get to come in and play the martyr after that person is dead. \n\nYour child just doesn't understand who is mother really is. Hopefully he will never have to know but at least you're keeping it real.", "NTA\n\nYou might have been a little harsh with your oldest but it's understandable given the situation. You were put through an incredibly challenging ordeal, and you handled it with as much grace and compassion as anyone I've ever seen. \n\nIf your wife really wants to be there, IMO she can tell your sons the truth about why she left their dad and then they can decide.", "YTA for how you talked to your son.", "YTA. This isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s not about your ex. It\u2019s about your kids who just watched a stepparent they love die.

I hate to call you an asshole.", "Something like 30% of men leave their wives after a cancer diagnosis.
