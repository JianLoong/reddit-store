That's ugly.\n\nWhile you're right to use Christopher's final days as an exercise in compassion, it's also worth turning some of that compassion onto Diana, who has done a horrible thing and must live with the consequences.  But despite having been married to her, you don't fully know her heart, her situation, or the rationales for her decisions.  Divorcing him at the outset may have been less cruel than neglecting him, for instance.  And medical bills aren't anything to sneer about, either.  It's easy from the outside to say \"she should've just accepted it!\" when medical debt is the number one cause of bankruptcy in the US (assuming you're in the US).  Should she have just accepted losing her house?  Possibly losing her ability to care for her kids?\n\nAnd oh, lord, caregiving is awful.  My grandmother died just over a year ago, and I watched my mother take care of her.  It's soul-draining work.  Diana might have known herself well enough to know that she simply couldn't do that.\n\nNow, all that said, I couldn't cut someone I loved off.  I've been married over 23 years now, and if my husband is dying, as we all will at some point, I will love him and do my best (although I'm definitely NOT the caregiving type, either).  But I'm not going to judge someone with school-age children and a fear of bankruptcy for saying that she can't do it and noping out of there early in the diagnosis.  I pity her, that she couldn't find the strength within to help him through it.  But I'm neither in her mind nor her shoes.\n\nAnd neither are you.\n\nNot saying that you should welcome her with open arms and include her in the ceremony, but treat your kids with the compassion you're trying to instill in them and say that you don't think it would be appropriate given how Diana and Christopher parted.  And don't degrade their mother to your children, even if you think she's behaved badly.

Not a good idea.", "NTA for your feelings but your response and action to your child, I think you need to look more critically at.\n\nI'm on the fence because I can understand how you might feel but idk Diana or her situation ultimately. But it's clear to me your son might need her there and your words and actions more than likely hurt him.  All I can say as a parent and someone who's had to take care of two dying grandparents (both of cancer) is that it's a horrible situation and I don't think a lot of people are capable of that kind of care, it's soul sucking work.  I can understand your reactions feeling justified because you have been going through a lot with this all, I'm sure. But as a parent we have to think of what our kids need first.  I understand there is obviously tons of resentment between you and Diana but it's not going to help your relationship with your children when you express that. Also speaking from experience in that, I'm not with my children's dad either.\n\nWith that in mind, my children witnessed deaths of people they cared about as well and it does cause trauma, even if it's not always apparent.  We need to be gentle on the little ones this is hardest on them.  I really hope you are able to get them to see a therapist, someone who specializes in truama, even if temporary especially your oldest because they seem like they might be taking that hard since they spoke up for their mom and with the way you spoke to them about that...  I know my children needed to talk deeply about losing family and the way we lost them, therapy really helped us cope.  Personally, I think if for nothing else but your oldest, let Diana go to the memorial.  Her children might need her there for them, and it's basically all she can do at this point for anyone involved.\n\nCompassion doesn't have judgment attached, so I can't judge Diana or you.  But I feel if you want to teach your kids true compassion, then it's you that has to be an example for that.  I'm sorry this process was so hard on you and your family.  I wish you all healing and peace.", "Kind of an AH. While you may be right I think it would be good for the boys to see their mom there.

Everyone, no matter what they did when someone was alive has the right to mourn and take comfort from a community of others also mourning when someone dies. I don't care if it's a mistress, an abusive parent, a person the deceased met on a park bench 1 time and then never saw again. People need that finality. They need to parse their feelings. They need to come to terms with the finality of their actions and past and the things they have done and the things they will never get to do again with the deceased. They need closure.\nYeah it was shitty of her to divorce him because he got sick and the costs associated but it's also an incredibly heavy burden to be a caregiver for someone who is sick. It takes both people's lives and never allows the caretaker to have their own life. I wpupd know as i am the caretaker and power of attorney for my very ill and mentally handicapped older brother.  If she did not have it in her to handle that, then she did not have it in her and punishing her by preventing her from grieving at a memorial is vindictive.\nI was prevented from attending my step grandfather's funeral and my step fathers funeral and memorial. My step father adopted me at 9 months old and both he was the only father I'd ever known and my step grandfather was the only grandfather I'd ever had. \nWhy was I denied entry? Because my step fathers family considered me dirty and worthless since I wasn't my step dads biological daughter.\nI have not only never forgiven his family, I have never been able to fully grieve because I did not get to experience the community aspect of grief. My grief is in stasis, perpetually longing for that group grief, Bonding us together. All that is left of my step father and step grandfather is memories and those memories are what makes them still alive, and without the group memories, they are both woefully incomplete. Not even ghosts, only shadows with the sadness poised on a precipice awaiting the wind to push it over and finally be felt.\n\nYTA also for talking to your child about his mother that way. Your child wants his mom there because he needs her support. He shared a life with her and his step father that you were not a part of and your child needs that tie and support. Your ex wife is someone you loved once enough to marry and have children with so she could not have been completely horrible. You trying to ensure your children know she's horrible is called Parental Alienation. To a child's mind it's abuse and has long term emotional and mental repercussions to that child and can impact all their relationships in the future. \nYour power of attorney ended the minute he passed and have no rights to decide who can and cannot be there or who the children do or do not need for support while grieving. \n2 weeks of end of life care does not trump several years in a relationship with him as she had while he was getting sick and had no diagnosis. You knew he was sick long before he was at end of life and did not take him in. You only took him in once you knew he would die soon. It was not hanging over your head, the endless unknown. The endless waiting and pause to your life. The question of how many months or years or decades your life was no longer yours and every decision made for them and never you and the expectation that you sacrifice all you are without complaint and without acknowledgement of your own needs, with everyone treating you as a gorrible person if you smile or laugh or go out with friends for 1 hour of joy.\nYou didn't have that. You had 2 weeks where you knew he had no time left. It was admirable, but you are no hero. Check your pride and let your child have his mother there, let them grieve together, and stop trash talking her (or plannig  to) to your child.", "Does your ex know the money is going to your sons or does she think she will be getting it?", "NTA except for the name calling.
