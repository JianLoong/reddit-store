Yes, the chances of something going wrong are small but should they ....... I'd not want to deal with the other family's wrath.", "I saw in the comments\n\n>Their idea is mainly for evenings when a couple might go out together.\n\nThis solidifies it for me as NTA. I have actually done this for neighbors, but it was for situations like they were mowing the lawn and wouldn't be able to hear the baby monitor (so can you get me if the baby wakes up), or needing to run a quick errand (they'll be back in 10 - 15 minutes). If this is going to be for several hours, it's not appropriate to leave the baby unattended.", "NTA for not participating in what might easily become criminal neglect.", "Ask Madeleine McCann\u2019s parents about how well this system works!", "NTA, you\u2019re right - it would be very dangerous.", "NTA. I assumed at first that this was about using a baby monitor for dinners at each other\u2019s house, in which case I thought you might be a *little* overprotective, but the actual scenario proposed would be a hard no for me. Being \u201cwatched\u201d by neighbors (who have kids of their own to worry about) through a monitor just would not make me feel safe at all. Someone to trade babysitting with is a wonderful thing, so I hope you can mend fences, but for me it\u2019d have to be one member of a couple staying in the other couple\u2019s house for the evening.", "NTA. Wow, that is possibly the worst idea in the history of bad ideas. \n\nHow are the kids supposed to know their parents are gone? Because if you tell them they're gone, and no one is in the house, they're going to freak, but if you don't tell them the parents are gone, and they wake up and no one's there, they're going to freak. \n\nI can't believe any competent adult would believe this was OK.", "Nta. Why not just babysit the kids  in that case?", "Absolutely NTA. What is so freaking important that any parent would leave their kid (baby? How old?) unattended. \n\nAnd further, being uncomfortable with that doesn\u2019t warrant them being salty about it.", "Wow that's a way of cheapening out on your kids safety. Absolutely NTA for being a responsible person and parent", "NTA. Holy shit, how are you the only sane, responsible parent between the 4 of you? This is a huge no-no. So dangerous.", "You're NTA. Wouldn't it be safer and more legal to agree to switch off baby-sitting duties once a week, or every other week? All the kids come to one house, those two parents watch them while the other set has a date night out somewhere. Next time switch.", "NTA\n\nYour concerns are valid. Whenever I hear people say stuff like this I always think of Madeleine McCann.", "NTA, hello, ever heard of Madeline McCann??   I don't consider myself overly cautious, but just no", "NTA \ud83d\ude02 boohoo for them that you didn't want to be a neglectful parent", "NTA there\u2019s literally a suspense horror novel with this exact concept called \u201cthe couple next door\u201d and their baby gets kidnapped so,,,", "NTA that is so dangerous and your instincts are absolutely right.", "NTA - baby monitors can have interference and they are not a substitute for actual in person supervision", "NTA I don\u2019t know if they were trying to get them selves called into CPS or not but that\u2019s the way to do it.", "Nta", "WTH!

But I think you\u2019re being alarmist and extremely uptight. I\u2019m 99% sure these responses proclaiming danger are not from actual parents or people are misunderstanding the situation. \n\nOn your concerns - This is not actually any more dangerous than having your children on a different floor of the house than you. When you use a monitor for sleeping children, you typically go outside of earshot of children which means you\u2019re relying on the monitor to \u2026monitor the children. If you\u2019re on the first floor or the basement and your children are upstairs on the second or even third levels, it would likely take you a few minutes to get upstairs to your children\u2019s room in an emergency. Do you ever leave the children in their rooms and go elsewhere in the house? That is no different than being 20 fit away in another house. As long as the parents have access to the house and the door isn\u2019t open to the public of course. Especially if the kids are sleeping!\n\nIf I heard a neighbor was uncomfortable with this, I wouldn\u2019t hold it against them but I would assume there are a bunch of other things they are uncomfortable with and tread carefully.", "NTA\u2026but this reminds me of what my parents did\u2026they would call the neighbor, they would answer and leave the phone line open (while they hung out) and pickup the phone every once in awhile to make sure we were asleep. \n\nNow that typed that out I feel old AF.", "NTA, honestly if you see them going out watch the house. IF you do not see a babysitter, call 911.  What they are doing is not legal or safe.  What if the kid gets up?  What if someone breaks in?  It only takes a few seconds for something bad to happen.", "Omg what's the big deal, I assume they can get in the house if one of the kids wakes up, it's like 2 extra seconds.", "YTA if you\u2019re actually monitoring the feed, you would know if it gets disconnected, there\u2019s a fire, one starts to wake up and can walk right over. It\u2019s still a sitter, they just aren\u2019t in the living room. This is no different than being in a large house or one with multiple floors imo.", "INFO - She stays home, you work?

Thank you for being the voice of reason! \nMy brother in law and his wife leave their baby and 7? year old under the care of a ring cam so they can go to the store together\u2014 I was mortified!", "INFO - Have you shared these concerns with your neighbours ?  What did they say?   Fully agree with your reasons btw", "Not the AH. It's one thing if they came over while the kids slept etc. But to just leave them and go out with you holding the monitor. That's borderline neglect", "NTA I thought you were going to say that your wife wanted to go to dinner at their house and bring the baby monitor, which isn\u2019t a great idea, but in actuality they want to leave the entire neighborhood and leave the kids alone? NOPE.", "Nta my middle child would wake up and walk around the house as an 18 month old.  My 3 year old doesn't usually cry in the night when she wakes up,  she simply gets up and walks around looking for me.  If I'm not in my bed she keeps looking for me.  Kids don't always cry when they need help.", "NTA. Perhaps they should familiarize themselves with the Madeleine McCann case.", "Send them an email telling them that you are not comfortable with this arrangement.  Retain this email.  They may just go out and have a nanny cam thinking if there is an issue, they will call you or another neighbor to run and take care of thier kids.  This will cover you if something happens and they try to blame you saying you were to be watching the kids via the monitor.", "Ehh I live in a twin and at night if the neighbor had to run a quick errand to like a drug store or supermarket she would just hand me the monitor on the deck (our decks touched) and I would just mind the monitor to make sure they didn't wake up. Never did it for full blown baby sitting just like a quick 20-30 errand if something came up- it was better then just sitting in her house for no reason.", "NTA but couldn\u2019t you come up with something else like one weekend you or your wife hang out in their house and watch their sleeping kids and the next weekend they could do the same for you? Then there would be one adult in the houses at all times and no one has to be the asshole.", "NTA. I once saw a couple in Wally-world using FaceTime as a babysitter.

If something happened at their house and the baby monitor malfunctioned, they'd blame you. Better get to the coldness without something going wrong.\n\nI could see relying on the baby monitor if one parent was home alone with baby and needed something critical unexpectedly but this is not that; I think the other family planned on giving you the baby monitor habitually so they could ho out for the evening and not pay a babysitter.\n\nInitially I thought this would be about having drinks together out in the yard, between the houses because the baby monitors reached out there.", "Not only that but who do you think gets sued if something goes wrong?

I'm fairly free-range parenting wise at home, but that's too much. I'm a lot more uptight in environments the kids aren't used to.", "I did I initially think of Madeleine but it isn't the same situation. There was no monitor at the McCann's holiday apartment and they left the external door open.

For others who don't know. \n\n> The McCann children had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment while their parents dined with friends in a restaurant 55 metres (180 ft) away.[7] The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Kate discovered Madeleine was missing at 22:00.", "Or, let the kids have a sleepover. Sounds like with the kids being in the same age range, it wouldn't be incredibly difficult to just have all 4 for a night and trade off.", "The kids are under 5 and sleeping. Why would they need to know that their parents are gone?", "Right?!?! Just bring the baby over to sleep at the neighbours house, set up a travel cot.\n\nNot sure how old the kids are but due to SIDS it is recommended that they have an adult in the room while they sleep until 6 months (ideally 12), or check on them frequently if that\u2019s not possible.", "In many ways, they are!

Or they go to bed even though they agreed to do this late? Terrible idea anyways but worse with the thinking of when they want to use this system.", "And she was 14! Most kids can stay home alone by 14 and many of them are even babysitting younger kids.", "And then the neighbors would go to them?
