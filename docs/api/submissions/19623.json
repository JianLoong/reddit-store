As a result of this I am having to leave my career at the end of this month and work freelance for far fewer hours and unknown pay. My partner was supportive of the descision to leave and agreed it was the right descision for me; I did not make this descision without consulting him. \n\nI have \u00a35K debt and \u00a36K savings. I am unlikely to reliably earn a consistent wage, and it is likely to be small due to my reduced capacity for work. For this reason I want to use my savings to pay off my debt and have 1 month of basic living costs where I pay rent. My partner has insisted for a long time that I need to get out of debt and while it didn't feel urgent enough to use savings for before, it definitely does now because I've lost my reliable income so now feel worried I will not be able to pay it off in the future unless I do so right now.\n\nI may qualify for some benefits (ESA and PIP) but do not qualify for universal credit due to my partner's savings an income. We are unmarried but have been together for nearly 12 years and have lived together for 3.5 years. My partner (31M) earns nearly twice my previous income when employed full time and has savings that exceed a year of my previous wages. (When I was earning full time, we both paid proportionally towards rent and bills so he has been paying more towards these than I did and has done consistently for three and a half years. When I went to half pay my share was reduced from \u00a3500 to \u00a3380/month). If I was applying for benefits as a single person I would be entitled to benefits that would cover my share of the rent/bills and also give me \u00a3300 to live on each month, but I am not entitled to these because of my partner's income. I am upset that the government takes his earnings into consideration as one of the reasons he doesn't want to get married to me is because he doesn't like the idea of being financially responsible for another person. \n\nMy partner has asked that seeing as I have three months of my pre-illness income saved, could I use that money to pay my normal (pre illness) share of rent for the next three months. \n\nI feel really uncomfortable doing this because that will mean I remain in debt. I would rather work freelance next month and pay a proportion of what I earn as my contribution towards rent. I brought up the fact I'm not qualifying for benefits because the government take his earnings and savings into consideration because they expect him to be supportive first before reaching out for government assistance. \n\nUPDATE: he has said that after these three months he will continue to do the agreement (so we'd pay proportionally: if I earn 5% of what he earns I pay 5% of the rent). It's only because 6k = 3 months of income pre illness that he wants 3 months of rent paid. I would still be able to pay off some of my debt and could prioritize the debt with higher interest.\n\nFinal update: I am using the money to pay off debt.", "created_utc": 1686751753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1498vbz/wibta_for_only_paying_one_months_rent/", "score": 669, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One of the things that doctors in the US often do when giving a woman a diagnosis of a chronic or terminal illness is to prepare them for the high likelihood that their male (it\u2019s usually the men who leave, not women) partner will abandon them within months. When one partner has a chronic illness, 75 percent of marriages end up in divorce. I imagine the rate is higher when the couple is unmarried and it\u2019s easier to split. When I got my rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis a month ago, my doctor addressed this matter with me; I\u2019m not married but I\u2019m in a long term relationship.

You should protect yourself and take some stress off your mind by paying your debt and preparing to separate from him. If you want to still date, fine, nothing is stopping you from dating and living separately.

That\u2019s because legally your money made by both of you as you live together should be equally accessed by both of you. However, he\u2019s depriving you of that support. He also refuses to get married on the basis that strengthens your claim to support. \n\nNote that while he *says* he doesn\u2019t want to financially support *anyone*, he\u2019s not being *asked* to support just anyone.
