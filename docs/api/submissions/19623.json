As a result of this I am having to leave my career at the end of this month and work freelance for far fewer hours and unknown pay. My partner was supportive of the descision to leave and agreed it was the right descision for me; I did not make this descision without consulting him. \n\nI have \u00a35K debt and \u00a36K savings. I am unlikely to reliably earn a consistent wage, and it is likely to be small due to my reduced capacity for work. For this reason I want to use my savings to pay off my debt and have 1 month of basic living costs where I pay rent. My partner has insisted for a long time that I need to get out of debt and while it didn't feel urgent enough to use savings for before, it definitely does now because I've lost my reliable income so now feel worried I will not be able to pay it off in the future unless I do so right now.\n\nI may qualify for some benefits (ESA and PIP) but do not qualify for universal credit due to my partner's savings an income. We are unmarried but have been together for nearly 12 years and have lived together for 3.5 years. My partner (33M) earns nearly twice my previous income when employed full time and has savings that exceed a year of my previous wages. (When I was earning full time, we both paid proportionally towards rent and bills so he has been paying more towards these than I did and has done consistently for three and a half years. When I went to half pay my share was reduced from \u00a3500 to \u00a3380/month). If I was applying for benefits as a single person I would be entitled to benefits that would cover my share of the rent/bills and also give me \u00a3300 to live on each month, but I am not entitled to these because of my partner's income. I am upset that the government takes his earnings into consideration as one of the reasons he doesn't want to get married to me is because he doesn't like the idea of being financially responsible for another person. \n\nMy partner has asked that seeing as I have three months of my pre-illness income saved, could I use that money to pay my normal (pre illness) share of rent for the next three months. \n\nI feel really uncomfortable doing this because that will mean I remain in debt. I would rather work freelance next month and pay a proportion of what I earn as my contribution towards rent. I brought up the fact I'm not qualifying for benefits because the government take his earnings and savings into consideration because they expect him to be supportive first before reaching out for government assistance. \n\nUPDATE: he has said that after these three months he will continue to do the agreement (so we'd pay proportionally: if I earn 5% of what he earns I pay 5% of the rent). It's only because 6k = 3 months of income pre illness that he wants 3 months of rent paid. I would still be able to pay off some of my debt and could prioritize the debt with higher interest.", "created_utc": 1686751753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1498vbz/wibta_for_only_paying_one_months_rent/", "score": 182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One of the things that doctors in the US often do when giving a woman a diagnosis of a chronic or terminal illness is to prepare them for the high likelihood that their male (it\u2019s usually the men who leave, not women) partner will abandon them within months. When one partner has a chronic illness, 75 percent of marriages end up in divorce. I imagine the rate is higher when the couple is unmarried and it\u2019s easier to split. When I got my rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis a month ago, my doctor addressed this matter with me; I\u2019m not married but I\u2019m in a long term relationship.

You should protect yourself and take some stress off your mind by paying your debt and preparing to separate from him. If you want to still date, fine, nothing is stopping you from dating and living separately.

That way he isnt solely responsible as you still have an income.  \n\nThe only other thing i can think of is to consider whether you go freelance as a sole trader or a limited company. If your income is likely to be below the IT threshold then you probably wont benefit from the tax reduction of dividends but if your business takes off its worth bearing in mind.", "I agree with the person above, this is not healthy. Your partner should be happy to support you during a tough period, not insist that  you stay in debt so you can pitch in your savings to pay the rent. Being together in a long term relationship, without marriage coming into it, means that you help each other ..you\u2019re supposed to be a team. I would also be very anxious staying with someone who sees a loving life partner as a burden.", "You have been dating a guy for 12 years, you live together, the government sees you as financially linked to the point that you can't get benefits, but he doesn't want to help you out financially (and that's his stated reason for not wanting to get married.)\n\nI don't give a shit if you are married or not. I dated my wife for 10 years before we got married. I'm not one of these people that thinks if you aren't married after 2 years it's a problem.", "What are you getting from this relationship besides being emotional attached to him? Cause seems like he gives nothing!", "Check to see if the penalty for using LISA money to pay off debt can be waved for disability.\n\nAnd pay off the debts. Yourr right situation has changed", "Wait, so your debt benefited both of you? And your partner is unwilling to put any money towards paying it off? \n\nI'm confused. Why even take out a loan if your partner is in a good financial position to just pay for the things that were needed?", "Okay that is terrible and i had no idea. That definitely changes things because its literally out of your control and i assume he knew of this prior to move in? NTA then, he is the ah. You should take steps to get away from him. You need support right now and he is not willing to help. It sucks because you would probably help him if the situation was reversed. He better hope he never gets sick..", "I would consider moving in with family to get the financial assistance you need to support yourself and perhaps ending that relationship seeing as he\u2019s too uncomfortable to support you and being with him makes no sense for you financially. If you force support upon him when he isn\u2019t open to doing it, resentment will build and if he doesn\u2019t support you, you\u2019ll feel it in your bones. Keep control over your life or find someone who wouldn\u2019t blink to look after you", "and you're a bot.", "This is the best comment on here.", "Thank you", "So is juggling three long term illnesses. I feel for OP, but it might really be better for her in the long run to walk away from this relationship. It's heartbreaking, but she needs support for the foreseeable future and if her partner won't give her that support, she might need to work on changing her living and relationship situations.", "That's an interesting take, thank you. I think there's such a stigma around benefits that I'm having a little difficulty getting over. I also can't quite adjust to the mentality that this might be my life now as I've always been hugely ambitious and an overachiever.", "I really strongly feel, that you want your partner to pay even if he is uncomfortable with it. And even though your words say otherwise I think you are not ashamed to be a burden on him as you are not even trying any other means of paying.", "I don't have one. I only agreed to leave my job thinking I could pay off my debt. My partner agreed I should do that at the time I made arrangements to leave.", "UPDATE: he has said that after these three months he will continue to do the agreement (so we'd pay proportionally: if I earn 5% of what he earns I pay 5% of the rent). It's only because 6k = 3 months of income pre illness that he wants 3 months of rent paid. I would still be able to pay off some of my debt and could prioritize the debt with higher interest.", "UPDATE: he has said that after these three months he will continue to do the agreement (so we'd pay proportionally: if I earn 5% of what he earns I pay 5% of the rent).

He has said no to marriage for a reason and it's not fair of me to assume we'll make it through this or even that he'd want to", "Okay that's really helpful, thank you", "Thank you, that's really important to keep in mind and I hope you're right regarding interventions.", "I think if it appears that way that's my error (it's hard condensing 12 years into 3000 characters)", "He said they were things we didn't need (microwaves, bookcases, bedside tables, lamps, food scales, storage jars, meat thermometers etc) not essentials. We come from different financial backgrounds and he's more used to doing without whereas I am more used to more home comforts etc.", "I don't know if he knew that prior to moving in. I didn't. I just didn't really think it'd ever be something that affected us because we've always been over achievers (good grades, first class degrees, outstanding post graduate diplomas, professional jobs - both of us) and neither one of us thought we'd ever be looking at a life on benefits.", "I don't have family I can move in with", "Yeah, that's gut wrenching, he's already said he doesn't want to be financially responsible for another human at any point.", "Reading this was absolutely heartbreaking for me.

Right now you\u2019re considering not taking care of yourself (I.e. not paying off your debt first) and not fighting for the benefits you deserve. These are not actions of somebody who is prioritizing themselves, and I think an ambitious and overachieving person would want to prioritize themselves. Good luck and be sure to give yourself grace in this new and challenging situation.", "When you were an ambitious overachiever, you paid taxes right? It's public funds, and you are part of the public. You paid into the system, now you get some of it back.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, the USA has similar rules. It's pretty common for recently disabled people to be forced to live separately from their partner or to get a divorce \"on paper\" so that they keep their benefits. Disability rights activists are badass and fight the good fight.", "Umm yes you should never feel like a \u201cburden\u201d to someone you\u2019re in a long term relationship with because you got sick and are struggling.", "What do you mean? She\u2019s saying she\u2019ll freelance to pay what she can? She\u2019s too sick to continue in her job but has found a workaround to get some income in even when sick.", "I agree with the other poster. You two really need to sit down and discuss your future because I don\u2019t see this relationship lasting at this point. He seems to want it both ways, sees your position and disability and your inability to work as you did before so he\u2019s encouraging to out your health first. But at the same time is not willing to step up as a partner financially to cover for you. It\u2019s his right but the two positions cannot coexist of your relationship is meant to survive.\n\nI\u2019m sorry but if he\u2019s still unwilling to help out then you need to really start thinking about yourself and your future.", "Right but you should ask him what he thinks happens in 3 months when you have no savings because you did things his way, but you still have the debt. Make him make a plan for you, and if he says it's not his problem or not his place then you know you need to go with the plan you made to get out of debt, because getting rid of the debt is top priority. The debt will only get worse as your income drops.", "He agreed but he is not responsible for you financially\u2026 so basically his advice was do what you want, it doesn\u2019t affect me cause we aren\u2019t married", "Okay he didn\u2019t make a vow. But girl staying with a man for 12 years who only wants you when your healthy is still a horrible feeling. Why don\u2019t you want to be with someone who supports you in sickness as a life partner. Vow or not but because of love.", "But why are you with him? It sounds really sad. You've been together for 12 years and his main worry seems to be that you pay your share as long as you can (until you're out of money and still in debt). If my long-term partner would lose his ability to work due to disability, we would face the situation together and figure out a way to move forward together, because I love him (even without vows). You deserve love and compassion and the fact that he had explained to you that he doesn't want to marry you because he sees you as a possible financial burden, is really sad. Let's be honest, right now he's the finished burden dragging you down, by preventing you from getting government support. \n\nYou mention somewhere that he has his own trauma and that he had reasonably explained why he doesn't want to marry you (or take care of you in general). So I want to reiterate, you deserve love and compassion, you don't need to settle for this.", "And yet I bet he still uses or benefits from the things you purchased", "So he grow up in poverty?  Those may not technically be \"necessities\", but they are certainly \"essentials\" for a middle class household and not frivolous.\n\nEvery item you listed has multiple benefits, mostly health benefits.  Even when my fan was lower-middle class we had all those, because the benefits outweighed the cost.", "So, pay off your debt. Don't put yourself in an even worse financial position. You will feel a lot better, and if you were to break up, you would be in a much better position to take care of yourself and your needs. \n\nYou only have 1k in savings, because your debts take priority. It seems precarious to rely on him at this point, so I'd go back to your caseworker and see if they can help you get on your feet and into your own housing. I would not personally stay in an environment where I wasn't sure if my needs were going to be fulfilled.", "Im really sorry OP that you are dealing with loss of identity while stressing over money/living situation. I hope you can find a support group because this is a huge transition for you. You are not less because this has happened to you and there is absolutely no shame in collecting benefits. Life is hard and its there exactly for circumstances like this. I dont think there is a winner in this situation, its tough for both of you especially if you both didnt know the financial implications of living with each other. I hope counseling helps you both get some clarity.", "He will for a child of his just not another adult", "I am applying for all the aid I'm entitled to.

You can be taken to court for fraud if you do not disclose this.", "Thank you", "I don't think depending financially on a partner is bad, but he needs to be okay with it. A relationship is what both people decide works for them. I don't think the length of a relationship is a factor here. If my current partner of 4 years got sick, I would be more than happy to provide for her. The same was true 2 years ago. But again, I am okay with that. Expectations are fine and communication is needed. But I feel her partner clearly communicated he is not okay paying for her rent.", "Based on her comments she doesn't want to look into other living situations and government support/ disability benefits cause it will be \"dishonest\" and would rather just have her husband pay since his income is more. Which is fine, if he is okay with it. But it doesn't seem that way based on his response. Secondly, I don't even think she believes she will be making livable wages freelancing. Cause if she does it's not even an issue, pay the partner the rent from saving and continue to work on your debt from your income. But she knows that's not an option. Again, I don't think it's wrong to depend on a partner financially, but he needs to be okay with it, and her words and actions are not lining up", "UPDATE: he has said that after these three months he will continue to do the agreement (so we'd pay proportionally: if I earn 5% of what he earns I pay 5% of the rent).

You\u2019re in a different country with different laws. Have you verified with an attorney there is no \u201cout\u201d? I lived with a disabled girlfriend for a year and the attorney she retained said as long as she paid her share of essential living expenses we\u2019d be legally considered roommates. I paid for \u201cextras\u201d e.g.  travel and luxuries. It may be different there but here it was easily worth the 1/2 hour consultation fee given how much she got each month. Without that neither of us could have afforded living together.", "Maybe you should move out. If your partner is supposed to support you financially, but doesn't, then you should not live together.", "There's a lot of shame associated with signing up for government assistance, it's pretty common for people to come up with excuses (\"dishonest\") as to why they don't deserve help. There's probably also a layer of denial toward finding out that your relationship of 12 years was not a \"for better or worse\" situation. \n\nNot saying there's any fault on the partner here. The situation has changed and he has a right to want out, financial  and medical stress changes things. It would be kind of him to at least cover her for a few months while she builds those work opportunities, or looks for a new place to live. Both sides need to decide what they want going forward.", "You're NTA but your partner doesn't sound great not going to lie! \n\nLove is love.
