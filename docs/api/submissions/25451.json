It's 5pm, she says no and that she doesn't want to go, her face getting red.

Also 3 is still a baby. Take the kid and run", "No no no no\u2026NTA, but if you don\u2019t act NOW, you will be, OP. This is abuse, plain and simple. You don\u2019t force a kid to eat, EVER. specially if she said she isn\u2019t hungry. Hunger does NOT act as some magical schedule that\u2019s the same for everyone. Hunger cues are variable, and not being hungry at 5pm sounds extremely reasonable to me. \n\nWhat is happening there is your child coupling the thought of hunger, or lack thereof, with extreme punishment that qualifies as abuse. Right now he is traumatizing her by slapping his hand on the table, a known tactic to make the abused know that she\u2019s gonna have a hard time-you even say so yourself by admitting he is trying to induce fear in her. You don\u2019t make your child fearful of you. This is not something a human being should ever inflict on another human being, let alone their own child. He is disregarding her emotions, forcing her to go to her room and then locking her in by blocking the door\u2026OP, you should have stopped him the second he carries  her away. Telling you that you are weak for protecting her is yet another abuser tactic. You\u2019re not weak, you are HER MOTHER. If anything happens to her, you should be here to defend her and make sure her safety is first and foremost. \n\nNot letting her listen and respect her hunger cues can lead to eating disorders. These happen to anyone, anywhere, and take a lifetime to fix. She will either force herself to eat and go down a path a anorexia and/or bulimia nervosa, or ignore her cues and end with a binge eating disorder. Teaching kids to listen to their bodies and cues is parenting 101. \n\nPlease, please, please, for the sake of your daughter, don\u2019t let any of this ever happen again, and show her that you are always there for her and will respect her, and that you will protect her from\u2026This.

He's a new parent. And sometimes we get caught up in focusing on what we think we are supposed to do as a parent (because of our own childhood, or societal pressures) that we lose focus on what we are actually doing to our kids. I'm just saying....instead of jumping to blowing up the family...OP should have a discussion with him.

This is NOT how you handle the situation and is 100% abuse!!! How OP says they handle the situation is the best and healthiest way to handle it for a child that young.", "He does it every time. He's not willing to change. That's what makes it abusive. If it was a one off I could see..but he knowingly does it.", "So you were too weak to leave your abusive husband for 12 years and now your mad someone is suggestion that OP leaves their abusive husband before a decade is tossed down the drain?", "Yes, yes it does mean she should leave him.  Short of getting things get and together to leave (which can take time, no one should ever stay and allow their child to be abused.  That makes them no better than the abuser.  Honestly, it makes them worse.  It's absolutely sickening that you are telling someone to stay and let their child be abused.  Because he will keep abusing that child until he \"decides to change\".\n\n\nShe can stay, sure, but I hope she realizes that it can very likely ruin her relationship with her daughter forever.  My mom decided to stay when my dad started abusing me with hopes that it wouldn't be too bad.  She still didn't leave when it got really bad.  She has health issues and will have no way to survive after my father dies.  Yeah, she will not be getting any help from me, except to make sure she's nice and settled in the middle of a homeless camp under a freeway.  I may or may not mention how she feels about homeless people before I leave (her views on them are vile, at a minimum).\n\n\nDo not stay with someone who abuses your kids.  The chances of an abuser changing are very, very slim.  It will only damage your child and not worth the risk of destroying your relationship.", "100% agree it's the WRONG way to handle it. But jumping to \"divorce him, he's never going to change\"? That's ridiculous", "OP never said she had discussed it and asked him to change", "Doesn't mean she hasn't.", "Hmm. Okay. So we are just supposed to make assumptions and give advice based on assumptions we have made? That takes away the efficacy of this sub", "NTA. That's not discipline. That's abuse.

Your husband always slams his hands in the table to startle her??? His is so wrong on many levels. She disagrees and his immediate response is to FRIGHTEN her?? This sets up major trust issues and she will ultimately Never feel she can come to her parents with problems. She will turn to any AH that sweet talks her, but could ultimately abuse her. Your husband needs serious therapy and you need to keep your daughter away from him while he\u2019s getting it. Your daughter will go NC as soon as she can if not. \n\nRight now you are NTA. If you don\u2019t continue to protect her and insist on him getting therapy, you will be the AH.", "NTA but this isn't just assholery... this is straight up abusive.", "NTA. That's not discipline. That's abuse. Leave and take your sweet, innocent child. You were right here 100%. Your baby doesn't deserve this, and YOU don't deserve this.", "NTA.  If you allow her to be abused by your husband as she grows up there is definitely a chance you will ruin your relationship with your daughter forever.  The early stages (slamming his hands on the table to startle her) are normal for him to do already with a major incident in escalation.  You will be the AH if he continues doing this past your talk with him because you will be allowing your daughter to be abused.  Some children view the parent who allows them to be abused worse than their abuser.", "NTA. Your husband is abusive and your child is going to end up locked in perpetual flight or fight mode, which is life destroying. You need to leave him and give her the safe home she deserves.", "NTA. Today it\u2019s your daughter, tomorrow it\u2019s you", "NTA. That's not discipline. That's abuse. Leave and take your sweet, innocent child. You were right here 100%.

That's massively abusive behavior.", "NTA your husband sounds awful. Kids remember this behaviour, and it can really impact their wellbeing", "NTA he *is* the bad guy unfortunately", "This is abuse and was disturbing to read. You need to leave him for your daughter's sake (and your own). Don't tell him in advance. Call a domestic violence organisation to help plan your departure. NTA.", "You're only the asshole if you let your husband continue to abuse your child. \n\nYou need to get both of you into a parenting class STAT. Start with your pediatrician. \n\nIf he's not willing to loom at change, begin documenting his behavior, start putting money aside, collecting your documents and talk to a family lawyer.", "NTA\n\nHe is controlling and manipulative. He is traumatising your daughter and you need to leave. Now.", "NTA, and you need a serious conversation sometime soon, backed up with as much science as possible. Try to stay calm but firm. You need to know what is wrong in his life and why did he act like that. If he carries on calling you \"weak\" and making personal insults, disengage and be prepared to walk out with your daughter as a matter of urgency. This is that serious. He is not instilling discipline, he is deliberately instilling fear in his daughter and that is abusive. \n\nHe is also overruling your parenting strategies and yelling/threatening to make you back down. That is also abusive.\n\nLoud outbursts coupled with violence against objects is one of the biggest predictors of violence against people. If he cannot be self-disciplined enough to keep his own temper under control when dealing with even the most minor of disobediences by your daughter - and let's be clear here, exploration of food and honesty about appetite should never be considered a disobedience - then he is a fundamentally unsafe parent.\n\nYou had everything under control - if she doesn't eat her food, it's her choice and it doesn't mean she gets different food or pudding. You put her food to one side, and if she feels hungry later, you reheat it. That's a healthy strategy. It doesn't enable pickiness. It lets her learn to manage her own appetite, rather than forcing her to eat when she's not hungry/because someone told her to, which can lead to fucked up relationships with food later in life.\n\nHe needs to understand that this is not OK. If you are going to even think of staying, then he needs to be going to parenting classes and/or marriage counselling and/or anger management classes. And if this is a pattern of behaviour and not an uncharacteristic one-off, then I would need one hell of a lot of proof that he is committed to change, because the thing about abusive people is that they lie and manipulate and pretend they're going to change, and then as soon as they have you back under their influence...they don't.", "NTA but YWBTA if you stay with him and keep letting him treat your kid like this.", "What. The. FUCK?!\n\nHey, OP? My bio-dad was abusive and it started like this. He is gonna hit her before long.\n\nNTA and please get yourself and your child away from this man!", "NTA this is child abuse. I don\u2019t know how else to say it. This man is terrorizing a THREE YEAR OLD CHILD and if you don\u2019t remove her from this situation you are complacent to child abuse. Your child is literally begging you to help, so help her.", "NTA. my partner ever slams his hands down in frustration to our children and we will be gone.", "Jesus fucking christ lady, this is not a difference of opinion about discipline, your husband is abusing and traumatising your child! THIS IS NOT OKAY.", "NTA your husband is abusive", "NTA. Your husband should research healthy parenting.", "ESH I don't like either of your methods, mainly because if your 3 year old is not hungry at dinner with enough frequency that you have a system for handling this I think you need to look at what her scheduled meal times look like, how much food is in each, and whether the snacks are to close to meals.\n\nUltimately, you don't want to be reheating her food after dinner because assuming she's going to be at a reasonable time her eating habits are far to close to her bed time.", "divorce babes divorce", "Obviously NTA. Your partner sounds cruel and \"weak\". At best, he is either forcing food on a child who is no longer hungry and overreacting when the child finally says enough.\n\nAt worst...", "NTA this is horrifying.", "NTA\n\n\nI couldn't handle being at dinner with him honestly. Thid sound sooo unessarily agressive.", "It's obvious that the husband's parenting style is abusive. What I'm wondering is that does he display this kind of aggressive behavior towards OP as well? If he does then it's time for divorce.\n\nOP NTA", "NTA forcing kids to eat can cause eating disorders and but not listening to her your teaching her from a young age that she doesn't have a voice or that it doesn't matter. As her parents you need to be her advocate.", "Reading this made my blood boil, how are you as the mother letting this go on? You need to think long and hard if this sort of upbringing (abusive and traumatizing) what you want for your child. Your approach is the correct way to do things. He is trying to teach her submission by fear (slamming his hands to intentionally scare her????). And then locking her in her room?? Talk about life long trauma and fear of being alone in the datk. Anyone who acts this explosive and can\u2019t be calm when a toddler throws a tantrum should never have been a parent. What\u2019s going to happen when she\u2019s older and talks back to your husband? Or refuses to be manhandled to her room? Is he going to escalate to physical abuse? Children who grew up in households with parents like your husband either grow up to being very confrontational themselves or they become a shell of what they could have been to not attract the anger of that parent. Is this what you want for her? Your husband needs to take some parenting and anger management classes if he has any hope of having a healthy relationship with his child. If he refuses, you need to be your childs advocate and be prepared to divorce his ass and take full custody. NTA for the specific incident you\u2019re asking about but YTA if you keep letting your husband abuse your child.", "Nta\n\nYour husband's behavior borderlines on abuse, and you need to have a serious discussion about how he's going to go about disciplining your child, and how it absolutely cannot be like *that*.\n\nYour husband seems absolutely unhinged, unless your daughter is a total hellion already at the age of three.", "\u201cMake him the bad guy?\u201d\n\nEek, nope the slamming of the table is enough to terrorize a 3 year old\n\nParenting classes/therapy immediately", "NTA. This type of behaviour isn\u2019t okay, your daughter is 3 and requires a little compassion and patience, not fear tactics.

He is the asshole. This is how you get food avoidance/phobias and eating disorders. My dad did almost the exact same to me, result was that I refused to eat pretty much anything except meat and potatoes until I was nearly 30. Vegetables would cause me to gag and have panic attacks because I associated them with being yelled at and even hit.", "The parents determine what a child eats and when, the child determines whether and how much.\r  \n\r  \nThis behavior of your partner is really not allowed. It's assault. Sometimes a child is just not hungry.\r  \n\r  \nNTA.", "NTA\n\nBut I can understand both parenting style. You guys just have to figure out a common ground.\n\nMaybe you can support him that she needs to eat at least a bit and he can let it slide that she eats only a bit.", "Lol.. oh yeah just leave your husband ., wtf kind of response is that. Clearly you don\u2019t have kids, it\u2019s easy to lose your cool when they are 3 and being little A-holes!!! \nI mean that doesn\u2019t make it right, but tell him to read a parenting book and maybe find some better tactics when it comes to mealtime and discipline because yes he will give her a food complex.", "Also, kid wasn't demanding different food, and OP wasn't planning on enabling pickiness by giving them different food. This is a completely healthy way of letting a child communicate their appetite. \n\nBy contrast, forcing a child to disregard their own hunger signals and eat when not hungry/when someone nearby is angry at them is absolutely guaranteed to result in a messed up relationship with food in later life.", "My tits will it be calmed. That\u2019s the dumbest phrase ever. Also, husband\u2019s behavior IS abusive and he\u2019s not willing to talk with her about it. He *always* slams his hands on the table, etc\u2026this is a pattern.", "Forcing a child to eat when they aren't hungry leads to a fucked up relationship with food. If a kid isn't hungry, they aren't hungry. When they decide they're hungry later, you give them the food that was offered earlier (assuming it was stored properly). My daughter's pediatrician *and* the WIC office gave us info back when she started solids about how it's completely normal for a baby/toddler to be ravenous one day and barely touch food the next. The important thing is to make the food available.\n\nWith older kids like your niece and nephew it's different because there can be underlying sensory or health issues, or even an undiagnosed allergy. But that's between their parents/guardians and doctor to determine. My husband was one of those kids, he just can not handle certain textures and he likely has oral allergy syndrome. He got punished for not wanting to eat the things that were making him queasy, making his throat itch, his mouth burn. It's *fucked up* to ground a child for not eating. Especially if the time hasn't been taken to figure out if there is a reason at play. Yeah some kids are just stubborn, picky, whatever. But sometimes it's because there's only a few foods that they've identified as being 'safe' - not causing problems for them - and they don't yet have the tools to communicate that or transform the 'safe' things into a proper variety of foods.", "And I remember being three, too.  She is going to remember Mom did not help her.\n\nOP, you have to take action.

Get proof.", "I think you are 100% handling, no special other food, when she is hungry she eats her plate,", "Wow I feel sorry for your kids.", "I thoroughly disagree with u/Aromatic-Blueberry-4's take on this thread but accusing a victim of domestic abuse of being weak because they did not/could not leave is not the way to go either.", "Ohhhhhh snap...", "Look at OP's reply to the \"why I think I may be the asshole\" bot.
