It's 5pm, she says no and that she doesn't want to go, her face getting red.

Instead of getting used to eating full meals at certain times of the day, she's learning to listen to her body and eat well when she's able. \n\nSit down with your husband and tell him that he's being unreasonable.

Also 3 is still a baby. Take the kid and run", "No no no no\u2026NTA, but if you don\u2019t act NOW, you will be, OP. This is abuse, plain and simple. You don\u2019t force a kid to eat, EVER. specially if she said she isn\u2019t hungry. Hunger does NOT act as some magical schedule that\u2019s the same for everyone. Hunger cues are variable, and not being hungry at 5pm sounds extremely reasonable to me. \n\nWhat is happening there is your child coupling the thought of hunger, or lack thereof, with extreme punishment that qualifies as abuse. Right now he is traumatizing her by slapping his hand on the table, a known tactic to make the abused know that she\u2019s gonna have a hard time-you even say so yourself by admitting he is trying to induce fear in her. You don\u2019t make your child fearful of you. This is not something a human being should ever inflict on another human being, let alone their own child. He is disregarding her emotions, forcing her to go to her room and then locking her in by blocking the door\u2026OP, you should have stopped him the second he carries  her away. Telling you that you are weak for protecting her is yet another abuser tactic. You\u2019re not weak, you are HER MOTHER. If anything happens to her, you should be here to defend her and make sure her safety is first and foremost. \n\nNot letting her listen and respect her hunger cues can lead to eating disorders. These happen to anyone, anywhere, and take a lifetime to fix. She will either force herself to eat and go down a path a anorexia and/or bulimia nervosa, or ignore her cues and end with a binge eating disorder. Teaching kids to listen to their bodies and cues is parenting 101. \n\nPlease, please, please, for the sake of your daughter, don\u2019t let any of this ever happen again, and show her that you are always there for her and will respect her, and that you will protect her from\u2026This.

He's a new parent. And sometimes we get caught up in focusing on what we think we are supposed to do as a parent (because of our own childhood, or societal pressures) that we lose focus on what we are actually doing to our kids. I'm just saying....instead of jumping to blowing up the family...OP should have a discussion with him. There are so many variables at play here and it's just frustrating when people's comments go full nuclear black or white.

He got punished for not wanting to eat the things that were making him queasy, making his throat itch, his mouth burn. It's *fucked up* to ground a child for not eating.

Do you grab them and physically push them to do it? Yell? Or do you take them aside and say \u201chey, what are you doing? Why aren\u2019t you listening to me?\u201d And if they\u2019re a decent person there\u2019s a valid reason and you go from there.

It might even be being a bit distant because your feelings are hurt and that\u2019s a valid reaction (note: purposely guilting them, silent treatment etc again, if you wouldn\u2019t do it to another adult it\u2019s not appropriate).

Purposefully makes messes, knowing it\u2019s the wrong thing to do. But she\u2019s 2. So I stop her when I see her, if I don\u2019t see it I talk to her, if I\u2019m frazzled I\u2019ll yell \u201cno! Stop\u201d and talk to her later. I ask her why she\u2019s doing it (she never knows the answers, but it\u2019s good practice). I get her to help me clean it up. If she doesn\u2019t I put her in time out so that a) I don\u2019t throttle her and b) I tell her, making messes on purpose is not ok. You don\u2019t get to play with your toys/eat dinner with everyone else/play with your sister if you are going to throw toys/food/sisters items all around. Natural consequence. \nNot putting away a toy after she\u2019s finished with it doesn\u2019t equal time out because it\u2019s not a normal consequence. A normal consequence is that mummy is sick of packing up your shit so packed away (for a time) it goes. If you can\u2019t look after your stuff then you don\u2019t get stuff. \n\nSo back to the actual scenario given: Why is daughter not eating dinner at the same time as dad, worth dad getting SO upset about?\n\nIf your kid was hitting or biting or hurting someone yeah. Get mad. That\u2019s not acceptable for adults to do and is going to have severe consequences down the line if they continue. Not eating at dinner time, what\u2019s the worst that\u2019s going to happen? They develop a bad habit? Eating disorder? Have a different eating time from the rest of society? Wtf is so bad that it\u2019s worth dad yelling, physically removing and restraining her??? \n\n\nMum has got this handled well. It\u2019s GOOD to teach children not to eat when they\u2019re full. The next lesson is teaching them some level of control over their appetite so they eat at the relevant mealtimes. But at fucking three years old, she\u2019s doing a good thing by not eating if she\u2019s full. If she\u2019s not eating because she just wants to keep playing, that\u2019s different again. Natural consequence is\u2026\u201dno it\u2019s dinner time, you sit at the table while everyone else is eating, but you don\u2019t get to play.\u201d Or she goes to bed hungry AT BEDTIME (but at three I wouldn\u2019t ever actually do that, maybe offer dinner again but if it was an ongoing issue of not eating dinner at the right time because they wanna do something else I\u2019d be more likely I\u2019d give fruit or dry cracker because natural consequence is that skip on dinner means you skip out on dinner). \n\nThe whole entire purpose of teaching children is so that they can function in society as successful adults is it not? Not the reason people have kids, the reason they bother teaching them anything. Why would you teach a child something that\u2019s not relevant in the real world? If you lie to friends/family/coworkers/whatever\u2026does someone come and steal your TV? Or do you get found out/have no friends/no one trusts you? I can\u2019t even think of a real world issue of not eating at the same time as everyone else\u2026best I can do is, if you continually go out to dinner with friends but refuse to eat do your friends lock you away or do they just think you\u2019re weird? Maybe don\u2019t invite you out to dinner? \n\n\nWhat is sending her to bed early teaching her?? Obey dad or else..punishment? Doesn\u2019t matter what your body is telling you, what dad wants is more important? Where in adult life, if you don\u2019t eat at the right time do you get immediately shut in a dark room against your will? There\u2019s no lesson there.", "You're a shitty parent raising entitled brats", "It takes most abusive victims 7 attempts to leave. In one of my attempts, I actually went to the police, after a beating, covered in bruises & holding my infant son.\n\nI was told not to waste their time because women like me just go back.\n\nThey refused to take a report. The male officers at the desk were joking & laughing about DV victims as I left & how we bring it on ourselves. \n\nI went back for another 8 months.
