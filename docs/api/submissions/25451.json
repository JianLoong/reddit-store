Instead of getting used to eating full meals at certain times of the day, she's learning to listen to her body and eat well when she's able. \n\nSit down with your husband and tell him that he's being unreasonable.

That's tough. I definitely don't think children should be punished for not eating their dinner. Your partner is handling it wrong for sure.

Also 3 is still a baby. Take the kid and run", "No no no no\u2026NTA, but if you don\u2019t act NOW, you will be, OP. This is abuse, plain and simple. You don\u2019t force a kid to eat, EVER. specially if she said she isn\u2019t hungry. Hunger does NOT act as some magical schedule that\u2019s the same for everyone. Hunger cues are variable, and not being hungry at 5pm sounds extremely reasonable to me. \n\nWhat is happening there is your child coupling the thought of hunger, or lack thereof, with extreme punishment that qualifies as abuse. Right now he is traumatizing her by slapping his hand on the table, a known tactic to make the abused know that she\u2019s gonna have a hard time-you even say so yourself by admitting he is trying to induce fear in her. You don\u2019t make your child fearful of you. This is not something a human being should ever inflict on another human being, let alone their own child. He is disregarding her emotions, forcing her to go to her room and then locking her in by blocking the door\u2026OP, you should have stopped him the second he carries  her away. Telling you that you are weak for protecting her is yet another abuser tactic. You\u2019re not weak, you are HER MOTHER. If anything happens to her, you should be here to defend her and make sure her safety is first and foremost. \n\nNot letting her listen and respect her hunger cues can lead to eating disorders. These happen to anyone, anywhere, and take a lifetime to fix. She will either force herself to eat and go down a path a anorexia and/or bulimia nervosa, or ignore her cues and end with a binge eating disorder. Teaching kids to listen to their bodies and cues is parenting 101. \n\nPlease, please, please, for the sake of your daughter, don\u2019t let any of this ever happen again, and show her that you are always there for her and will respect her, and that you will protect her from\u2026This.

He's a new parent. And sometimes we get caught up in focusing on what we think we are supposed to do as a parent (because of our own childhood, or societal pressures) that we lose focus on what we are actually doing to our kids. I'm just saying....instead of jumping to blowing up the family...OP should have a discussion with him. There are so many variables at play here and it's just frustrating when people's comments go full nuclear black or white.

I'm just saying, we are all humans, not characters in a superhero movie (evil or hero). There is a grey area and judging on the limited information we have, I believe this falls in a grey area of being human.", "I\u2019m a parent. This is NOT how you handle the situation and is 100% abuse!!! How OP says they handle the situation is the best and healthiest way to handle it for a child that young.", "He does it every time. He's not willing to change. That's what makes it abusive. If it was a one off I could see..but he knowingly does it.", "So you were too weak to leave your abusive husband for 12 years and now your mad someone is suggestion that OP leaves their abusive husband before a decade is tossed down the drain?", "Yes, yes it does mean she should leave him.  Short of getting things get and together to leave (which can take time, no one should ever stay and allow their child to be abused.  That makes them no better than the abuser.  Honestly, it makes them worse.  It's absolutely sickening that you are telling someone to stay and let their child be abused.  Because he will keep abusing that child until he \"decides to change\".\n\n\nShe can stay, sure, but I hope she realizes that it can very likely ruin her relationship with her daughter forever.  My mom decided to stay when my dad started abusing me with hopes that it wouldn't be too bad.  She still didn't leave when it got really bad.  She has health issues and will have no way to survive after my father dies.  Yeah, she will not be getting any help from me, except to make sure she's nice and settled in the middle of a homeless camp under a freeway.  I may or may not mention how she feels about homeless people before I leave (her views on them are vile, at a minimum).\n\n\nDo not stay with someone who abuses your kids.  The chances of an abuser changing are very, very slim.  It will only damage your child and not worth the risk of destroying your relationship.", "100% agree it's the WRONG way to handle it. But jumping to \"divorce him, he's never going to change\"? That's ridiculous", "OP never said she had discussed it and asked him to change", "Doesn't mean she hasn't.", "Hmm. Okay. So we are just supposed to make assumptions and give advice based on assumptions we have made? That takes away the efficacy of this sub"]}
