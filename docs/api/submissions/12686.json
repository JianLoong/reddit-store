I used to hear everyone\u2019s mothers complain to mine about their exes who wouldn\u2019t want to go halves on all this stuff and in my head I was always wondering how so many adults could be so fucking stupid. Even the ones with 50% custody would be refusing to pay any amount of school fees etc and shockingly now a lot of those kids don\u2019t talk to that parent as adults.", "Or heaven forbid their feet grow AGAIN.", "Sure but it's incredibly easy for those less vigilant/knowledgeable to take too much. Limiting the quantities it's sold in is an easy and effective improvement.", "Lol...rocky road for me, kids won't touch it \ud83d\ude02", "I wonder if the British Aldi carries their own version?  American Aldi does and my understanding is that they're very, very close.", "Aldi has good girl scout cookie knock offs.  At least in the US.  I hope you get to try thin mints some day.  They are really best straight out of the freezer.", "mmmmm\u2026Samoas\u2026. My personal kryptonite!", "Aldi sells a cheap substitute", "You can make a pretty decent knock off at home.\n\nYou need:. Ritz Crackers, and mint chocolate.\n\nMelt your chocolate, and dip the crackers. Let 'em set, et voila!  easy peasy \"Thin Mints\".  I make them every year at Christmas time.\n\nThey freeze fantastically, and if you have the will power to leave them for a bit, the flavour gets even better.", "Aldi makes the best peanut butter patty dupe!", "No. That's not at all how any of this works and I really hope you don't have children who are in this situation.\n\nWhat could happen: OP might possibly ask her ex to stop putting the children in the middle of their situation, in a conversation with just them involved. It should be short, sweet, and without tempers raised on her end.\n\nNext, she could have a conversation with her children about the reality of things: sometimes they get things mom doesn't, and sometimes mom gets things they don't. Teaching them creates a sense of fairness.\n\nOne thing that was helpful during my divorce was a paper \"contract\" with my son that my ex and I both try to keep to. She could try the same thing, regardless of whether or not he does. He doesn't have to be mentioned much, just enough. This contract is to make sure the kids know she isn't going to use them as messengers, she isn't going to use them as weapons in an argument, or various other things. The truth is, what dad was doing makes the kids extremely uncomfortable (most often than not) and is completely inappropriate.\n\nYou being so concerned with who the fun parent is shows you aren't really concerned about the comfort of the kids.", "When I was a kid, selling as many boxes as I could meant badges for my sash. I grew up in a very large city & my troop didn't do much of anything. I belive we went to a camp one year but that was about it. If I can get my weight down to where I want it to be by next Feb when the cookies are being sold again, I'll probably splurge on a box of Thin Mints. Until then, I have to be good & keep my chocolate consumption to a minimum & I can eat 1/2 box of them in one sitting, so that won't help me.", "I think I just gained 5 lbs reading what you wrote.", "I thought it was $400/week and thought for 4 kids it was eh\u2026 but per month?! Oh no no!", "Jesus, I pay more than $400/month for our pets\u2019 food!", "It's really a joke instead of actual support at this point. Also the kids stay at their fathers 1 weekend per month. So 2/30 days. The guy can't even be called a father at this point. Time to get the court involved", "It\u2019s not abnormal to acknowledge children are expensive. DoorDash for a one person meal is $10-20. DoorDash for 5 people is $50-70. Ordering for one person is inherently a lot more affordable.\n\nSure, it\u2019s nice to share but sometimes you just need a treat and can\u2019t always afford to treat everyone. Not letting the kids know that she ordered food is the kindest solution: it\u2019s not like she was flaunting her food.", "Fun fact: if she gets a court order, he\u2019ll end up paying more like $4000/month, AND he\u2019ll have to pay her retroactively. So he\u2019ll end up owing $$$$ which will be put into a payment plan and come straight from his paycheck every month.\n\nOP your ex is a controlling tool. He KNOWS he\u2019s taking advantage of you financially, and the fact he called you over takeout \u2026 completely ridiculous. \n\nVery gentle advice here: it\u2019s time to put on your big girl pant and tell your kids Tough Shit. You are the parent, you are the adult. If you want to pour ice cream over your head and roll around in it, YOU are the parent. Not them, and not your ex. \n\nWhile the kids are gone, scream into a pillow or yell in your car - find your voice. If you are being policed over takeout, I can\u2019t imagine how the rest of things are going.\n\nSome simple math: pretend your monthly rent/mortgage is $5000 a month. $5k/4 weeks = $1250/5 people = $250x4 kids = $1000 a WEEK. That\u2019s not touching utilities, groceries, etc. Multiply by 3 weeks bc he has them 1 week, that\u2019s $3k per month. I don\u2019t care what bullshit stuff he\u2019ll pay for - clothing/whatever- that\u2019s his JOB, not a favor. \n\nHe needs to pay for therapy for all of you so you have help walking back the poison he\u2019s spoon feeding to you and the kids.\n\nETA: if you take him to court there\u2019s a very good chance that he\u2019ll also be ordered to pay the court costs", "I have an ex like that. OP, I get why this person is your ex and if you read this, you need to get this crap on the record in court because it\u2019s likely he owes you a lot more. I get a couple hundred dollars a month from him and he still expects me to pay for everything the kids need, which is not at all how child support works. Thankfully, I have plenty of funds to take this AH back to court. He tells the kids every month that I\u2019m supposed to be buying them a couple hundred dollars of stuff every month because of his support. I spend that in just gas driving them to and from school.", "That is actually what child support is meant for. Listening to Judge Judy, it's to cover the costs of providing housing, utilities, and food. It's for all of the necessary living costs of that child.  Not to buy toys or clothes or non necessities.\n\n(Totally agree with you. Just expanding on it)", "Tylenol for the Americans.", "I once told my son that a container of dark chocolate covered almonds was really huge black pepper. He couldn\u2019t read yet and also loved dark chocolate. But those were my almonds!!", "You wouldn\u2019t like it it\u2019s spicy", "Their dad should take them for three weeks and budget all their expenses within $400. It always galls me when parents like the dad act like this pittance (in the grand scheme of things) of child support is a majestic sum that the other parent is frittering away on themselves: $400 might barely cover groceries, depending on their ages.", "Lol my dad was awarded $100/month back in the 70s, and it was ridiculous then. I can't imagine that seeming fair now. That's not even a weeks worth of food.", ">him to even indicate that he wouldn\u2019t take the children if I put him on child support \n\nThis is an obvious manipulation tactic to keep you from asking more of him. I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first of his manipulative, controlling behavior you\u2019ve been subject to.", "Chemists sell 100 packs for about 2-3 dollars fyi. Am also Aussie. Think it's branded panamax at most, but Priceline has a sandoz one as well.", "Yeah I know. But they would still use them and not tell me which was more the issue. We still brought normal panodol but I had a stash or period pain relief for emergencies (even my handbag wasn't safe that year)."]}
