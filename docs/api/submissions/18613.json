{"id": 18613, "submission_id": "13wj48r", "title": "AITA for leaving my baby on the bed with her unwell father while I make her a bottle, only to have her wake him with her crying?", "selftext": "\nMy (34F) and my partner (28M) have a 4 month old daughter who seems to enjoy staying up until 2, sometimes 3am despite me trying to soothe her to sleep with breast, bottle, and baths. Most the time she doesn\u2019t cry, she\u2019s just fidgety. My partner usually stays up that bit later with us as well because normally it takes him some time to wind down after finishing work at 11pm.  So last night, my partner came home from work with a headache. He made the conscious effort to go to bed earlier to try and rest it off. I normally have baby in the room on the bed with me to feed as it\u2019s easier to lie down and breast feed especially when I\u2019m tired. She finished off a big bottle that I made and was still a bit hungry and restless. I left her on the bed, went to the toilet, then proceeded into the kitchen to get her bottle. Unfortunately, the formula we\u2019re using for her at the moment doesn\u2019t dissolve properly but it helps with her reflux. I have to strain the lumps through a sieve to prevent blockages in the teat. \nShe started crying, so I hurried as fast as I could to get back to her. I get back into the room and was met with hostility from my partner. He asked \u201cWhere were you? What took you so long?\u201d I told him I was getting her a bottle, but I had to wash up the sieve first. He asked me why I couldn\u2019t have taken her with me. I told him that he was her parent too, but honestly I feel it\u2019s just easier doing all of this with both hands free. He responded again with more hostility and said, \u201csorry, I forgot that you\u2019re tired from sitting around all day with your tit flopped out\u201d.  I was appalled. I called him a disgusting pig. I reminded him that I do all of the house work, all of the running around for him and the kids and that everything is done and the house is looking great despite my health not being the best with my fibromyalgia. I explained to him that I try so hard to make sure that I\u2019m doing everything else so he can just focus on his job and nothing else.  \nThe argument took a turn and he said we were over. I stood my ground saying I wanted to sort the issue but in the midst of all the yelling and screaming I just said fine, you win. We won\u2019t talk through the problems and we can end the relationship here.  \nI didn\u2019t sleep at all last night and left for my mums today to try and get some sleep. We haven\u2019t spoken, haven\u2019t seen each other, and neither one of us has sent the other a text. He blocked me on social media and depleted my bank account sending the last of the money in my account to his bank account that I don\u2019t have access to.  \nSo Reddit am I the AH for not taking baby with me and left her crying with my partner, or should I have made more of an effort with baby when he was feeling unwell?.

Yeah, NTA. That is not a normal reaction.\n\nI get that he had a headache but from what you\u2019ve said he was awake when you got up, there\u2019s no reason he couldn\u2019t have at least tried to calm her for the 10 minutes you were gone.", "NTA \n\nYou're/were in a abusive relationship.
