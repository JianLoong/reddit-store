Recently, I got my license and I have a car, so I can drive too and from school. Sally is slightly older, but she has still not gotten her license. She has an older sister with a license and a car, but that sister doesn\u2019t have a 7th period and goes home early. \n2 weeks ago she started just showing up at my 7th period classroom and walking with me out of the school. Every time I ask \u201cdo you need a ride today?\u201d And she just stares at me. Today, she claimed she had told me that she needed me to take her home every day; however, I have no text record or memory of this. \nI absolutely hate taking her home. Part of the freedom of the license is being able to go to get coffee after school with a friend or pick up a snack from the grocery store or having a nice peaceful moment alone to cry about the past 8 hours. Can\u2019t do that when there\u2019s someone to take home. She doesn\u2019t respond to my questions with anything other than idk or good. The few times I\u2019ve gone to go get snacks I asked her to accompany me in the store and even offer to get her something, but she refuses. \nLast year, my parents had been ready to pay Sally\u2019s older sister to drive me to school but her car was full already. Sally has just decided to come home with me without discussion of any form of compensation. Her home is a little out of the way for me and the gas will add up week after week.\nOur relationship has been a bit rocky for the past few months as she seems to be only inviting me to not be alone and then immediately abandons me or shuts me out of the conversation when she sees her more \u201cpopular\u201d friends. This weekend, we were standing in a circle of friends that we all were friends with and she stepped in front of me to block me out of the circle. Last semester, we were seeing a play and she turns her back to me before, during intermission, and after to talk to said \u201ccooler\u201d friends.\nWould I be the asshole if I asked to no longer be her ride home?", "created_utc": 1676439639, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112qmsr/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_friend_of_15_years_a/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stand your ground.  You don't owe anyone anything and you gotta learn and practice your boundaries now while you're young... It'll help a LOT later in life. You also don't owe her an explanation or reasons why you won't drive her of she asks.  Just a clear No and remember if she tries to argue that you're not obligated to participate.\n\nSorry to hear your \"friend\" is bunk and using you.  It may be time to \"break up\" with them.  It sounds like it's a frustrating and painful relationship.", "NTA\n\nSeems she has plenty of other friends who she can get rides from.\n\nAlso if you have no record of making this arragement you aren't breaking it.", "NTA.\n\nThat's not a friend. That's someone who is taking advantage of your generosity. It seems as though she thinks she feels like she's entitled to free rides; no ifs, buts or maybes. Don't do her anymore favours because I guarantee she won't appreciate them.\n\nIt unfortunately doesn't even seem like she thinks of you as a friend in the first place. Don't waste your time on her: invest time into real friends that will treat you how you deserve to be treated :)", "NTA - Stop giving her rides but don't tell her, just go on your way. After all, that's the communication standard she set in the friendship!", "NTA, and also, it's ok to tell her that it's not cool to step around and ignore you like that. That honestly made me a bit mad, because it's just so rude. I would just say \"I'm not giving you a ride home anymore\" as firmly as possible, and stand your ground. If she tries to say she asked you, say that you don't remember, but you're not doing it anymore regardless. It sounds like she's not a good friend, so this'll be better for you.\n\nAlso, if it makes you feel better, I had a friend of 26 or 27 years that I cut off a few years ago. It's gonna be hard if that's what ends up happening, but it made my life better to do that, because the person was treating me badly, just like in your case. I also know for a fact that the person I cut off moved on to do that to another person after I stopped being her friend.", "Girl some friendships are not worth the effort to keep. She seems entitled and annoying. I know it feels like a waste of so many years of friendship but you deserve better. You are under no obligation to help her or drive her around! \n\nShe is abusing your kindness and as you have stated been a big inconvenience to you personally. It is YOUR car. \n\nYOUR time.\n\nAnd she seems like a shitty friend only using you for a ride. \n\n\nTell her to fuck off or just get into your car next time and lock her out or tell her you have other plans she needs to make alternative transportation plans.\n\n\nShe seems like a vindictive little snipe honestly and i would tell my parents if you have a good enough relationship with them that you don't want to waste fuel driving her around incase she starts shit with you after.\n\n\nYou deserve better friendship and again you will meet amazing people who value and appreciate you. Trust me. I had similar situations with a friend in high school and at 28 i honestly didnt speak to those people after school anyway. Never seen them since. They aren't relevant as an adult. The most amazing lesson you can learn especially so young is to value yourself enough to not take this kind of shitty behavior from ANYONE! Respect yourself and know you deserve better than a friend that ignores u except when it benefits them. \n\nEdit: Forgot my judgement lol NTA\n\n\n\nif people did that we would have alot less guys and girls posting on here about staying in shitty insecure relationships with people who don't respect them out of fear or because they are incredibly insecure because of these people.", "Nta. Stop giving her rides.", "NTA. She's just using you for your car.  I dealt with the same thing in high school because I had a license when other friends didn't and suddenly I became a chauffeur", "NTA.  She's insisting that you agreed to giving her rides and then sucking the joy out of said rides.  Time to take a step back from this friendship.  Tell her that you'd like to be able to do things other than go straight home after school and therefore can't be her ride anymore.  \n\nIf you can, avoid burning a bridge.  Just graciously step back.  You're both young, and I'm glad I weathered some of these downs with my best friend.  We met when we were twelve and we're both now 31.  Long-term friendships have lulls and rough patches and I hope that's what's going on here.", "NTA\n\nStop giving her rides now.  She is not a friend.  She is using you.  Move on.", "NTA.   Make plans after  school and tell her you aren't going home.  She doesn't need to k ow what your plans are ( go get coffee, want a quiet time alone)\n\nShe's using you as an uber", "NTA for not giving her a car ride regularly, but i dont understand why you're bringing her behaviour around popular friends here. That's... Kind of irrelevant?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Tell her that she needs to find her own way home because you are not friends and you are not her personal driver. If she continues to follow you out of school, unlock only your door to get in the car and drive away.", "You don\u2019t have to take her, especially when she takes it for granted, and is unpleasant. I\u2019d start with telling her that I have a doctors appointment, or that I need to go somewhere\u2026 she sounds manipulative enough that she might want to avenge herself if you ruin her master plan.", "NTA, please don't let this person continue to take advantage of you and your kindness to them. It really sucks to have a friendship dissipate into nothing but it sucks harder to continue to put effort in/help out/be the good friend while they do next to nothing for you in return.\n\nAs an outsider even I'm mad at how you're being treated, you don't have to be mean, but put your foot down and stop letting this person take advantage of you. You'll feel much better without that weight on your shoulders.", "NTA\n\nShe is not your friend.  \n\nI also think she won't take no for an answer.  So you may need to be passive aggressive to get your point across.\n\nSo things you could do:\n\nStay back after school for extra study - do any of the teachers offer a homework/study club?  Bonus here is your marks will improve.  She can stay at study group too.... or find another way home.\n\nOrganise to catch up with another friend.  Sure the entitled girl can come along but you'll just ignore the whining and you'll leave when you want to and/or go somewhere else first... or she can find another way home.\n\nRefuse to drive without paying a 'taxi' fee - set that for whatever you want ie $10 a day.  Or she can Uber herself instead.\n\nThere's even a consideration to be given to you catching the bus for a few days so that there is no car to be driven home in.  Or if you have another friend with a car, see if they are happy to give you a lift instead of her getting a lift from you.  Your friend would find it easier to say no to her than you would.\n\nThis isn't a friendship at all and certainly not one that needs to be continued.  You are being used and abused by this so called friend.  Time to cut the apron strings.  Friendships change as time moves on... Time to call time on this one.", "NTA stand up for yourself she is using you", "Nta. You have no obligations to her.\n\nHowever I am a little concerned by her treatment. If she shuts down, it seems she is also going through the something. Growing up can be hard. Some take growing up harder. Depression, anxiety,  the feeling of acceptance is wanted. Maybe she is experiencing these things. \nIt is not your responsibility to make sure she is okay but for yourself if you are feeling any of these things. You might not even realize it. Wanting peace to cry after 8 hours of a grueling day is okay. School is hard. Kids who are mean, rude...make it harder. Life is such when growing up and trying to find yourself. \n\nAs for the friend of 15 years......tell her to kick rocks. She is using you. She has shown where you stand in her life.", "Don\u2019t ask. You tell her you will no longer be here ride. And you don\u2019t need to giver her a reason. Not wanting to do it is reason enough.", "Face it, she isn't your friend. She's using you. You're better off without her. NTA", "NTA. \n\nBut shes not your friend, shes using you when she needs it because her other \"friends\" don't want to have anything to do with her outside of social gatherings, much like her with you. \n\nShe only talks to you for a ride. \n\nShes not your friend. Go ahead and cut this one loose.", "NTA. No more rides home if she wants to be rude to you. I was lucky enough to have friends that picked me up (I was directly on their way) and drove me home my senior year in high school and it was amazing. I was really grateful because our bus was 25+ minutes late every day and in the winter, it got dangerous being out there so long. It was also nice to have seatbelts. \n\n>Today, she claimed she had told me that she needed me to take her home every day\n\nDoes she? As I pointed out, I did need that because there were so many issues with my bus that sometimes didn't show up at all. Do you all have similar issues? If not, then when she shows up, just explain you aren't available for rides at this point.", "NTA\n\nPeople change, friendships come to an end.\n\nTime to move on.", "NTA - getting a car and independence plus having a responsibility and outgoing expense is an excellent way of finding out who your real friends are. Don\u2019t let her walk all over you just because you\u2019ve been friends for so long OP. If she wants a lift every day she should engage in conversation with you and at least offer some sort of money for fuel or contribution (even if it\u2019s buying you coffee!).", "NTA. How did she manage to get home before you got the car? She should just go back to doing that, especially if she's not nice to you.", "NTA but you don't need to ask her. Just tell her. If she follows you to your car don't let her in. Let one of her other friends take her home. She's using you. She doesn't view you as a friend, only a ride. So stop helping her. You don't owe her anything.", "NTA  This is tough, because apparently your parents know the family.  Start lingering at school.  Maybe join a club or go to the library.  Stop and talk to a teacher.  Set up counseling.  Leave something in your locker.  Make yourself scarce until she finds another way home.\n\nYou don't want a situation where your parents tell you to take her.", "NTA, she isn't behaving like a friend would and your resentment is normal. As a teenager, I made the mistake of hoping people would change. People will change only if they really want to, if ever. Don't expect things to turn out different eventually. You will only waste your time and feel even more resentful. This is who she is, you don't have to drag this longer. If you have common friends, be civil with her while in the group, but nothing more. Focus on the others.\n\nI cut off contact with someone I've known for 35 years half a year ago. Our values became incompatible to a point where it became a hill to die on for me. It happens.", "Nta she is using you because she knows you won't stand up for yourself. If you act like a door mat you will be treated like a door mat.  Tell her you will no longer be able to take her home.  You do not have to give a reason. Just say it is not possible or it's not working out. Stand up for yourself.", "NTA\n\n\"Make plans\" every day after school and don't mention what they are. Just say that you aren't going home for a couple of hours. I wouldn't burn bridges like others have been saying because I imagine she is very vindictive and you still have to go to school with her for a couple more years. Give her the slow ignore and turn her into an acquaintance because she sure isn't your friend.", "NTA. She's not a friend. Give people an inch and they will take you a mile or in this cause many miles outside of your destination.", "Absolutely stop giving her rides. Don't say anything,  just don't unlock her door and drive away. She is fluent in rudeness and will understand.  She'll probably respect you more, which is absurd, but likely.  You don't want her as a friend. NTA", "The \"friends\" behaviour is kind of relevant.  I would not hesitate to go out of my way and taxi a friend but when people who say they're my friend are being assholes then I stop giving.  Sounds like OP is frustrated with the whole relationship dynamic and is feeling shorted by her \"friend' because OP is still showing up but \"friend's\" vibe has changed.  OP is meeting and exceeding her \"friend's\" needs at her own expense and getting less of her needs met and made to feel alienated.", "Just a more fierce NTA then.", "Definitely."]}
