Mia and I never got along good, I tried my best but tbh my husband has a spiteful ex who filled Mia\u2019s head with lies about me. This resulting in Mia and I budding heads often. Along with that, we only got Mia on weekends due to my husband busy work schedule and as she got older she\u2019d rather be with friends. She never really bonded with either of our other children. \n\nMia needed extra money for summer, and we needed a sitter since we would not have child care for the summer so we made an arrangement. We needed help watching the children, and cleaning and cooking while we worked, we paid her a bit extra bc our 4 y.o is still learning with the toilet and needs extra help. The first few days went well, and she was paid as agreed. The next few days came by, and I started noticing Mia wasnt cleaning up as she was requested, infact the house was messier then when we left. We don\u2019t expect just her to clean, but to attend to things our other children were too young to do, which we paid her for.

After a long talk with my husband we decided not to pay her for this week.\n\nMy husband and I told her this and she was furious, she said we wasted her time and that she should atleast be paid because she tried her best. I explained she didn\u2019t try her best, and she was irresponsible. She said she still put her time in and deserves to get paid. We told her that we wouldn\u2019t be, and that was final.

Was there a reason the twelve year old didn\u2019t wake her? \n\nOut of curiosity, what are you paying her for babysitting two children, cooking, cleaning the house, and potty training a four year old? At eighteen, if she did not have experience with kids, she may be on a learning curve.", "YTA. If you didn\u2019t like her work you should have fired her. Instead you had her continue working the whole week. You owe her. Also, what are things around your household that your 12 year old is not old enough to do, but your 18 year old is? Why can\u2019t the 12 year old make his own food? No wonder she doesn\u2019t like you. Your husband is equally as sucky for signing off on this.", "YTA if a boss fires an employee they don\u2019t get to refuse to pay them for the previous week! They can fire them on the spot, but the employee still gets paid for the time they were at work. PERIOD", "YTA\n\nShe put in the time.  Pay her because she was there, then fire her and hire a different babysitter.\n\nJust what are you paying her?  You're asking not just for babysitting, but for cooking and cleaning as well.  How much would you pay a legally hired unrelated adult housekeeper to do all the things you're asking her to do, for the amount of time you're asking from her?\n\nAnd how does what you pay compare to what she could get at a different summer job, outside the house, if she wasn't helping you?  What about hours?  If you're working eight hour shifts, you're expecting her to start work when you leave for work, and keep working until after your commute home.  That's probably a ten hour day.  And then you sometimes show up late.  That is not how a good employer treats an employee.  (And are you paying time-and-a-half for overtime over 40 hours, as a regular employer would do?)\n\nI suspect you're paying her somewhat less than she could make elsewhere, and a lot less than you'd pay if you legally hired a housekeeper (proper bookkeeping, taxes, etc.) to do the same task.\n\nIf you're paying her under the table, you're also not taking care of things like social security and establishing, legally, that she's employed at this time, which could affect her retirement in the future. (If you are in the US.)\n\nThis job also does absolutely nothing for her when it comes to building her resume and work history, giving her one less reason to put herself out too much for this.\n\nAlso, you say she hasn't bonded with you or your children. That's okay.  She didn't marry you, her father did.  She made no vows or commitments.  You've been married for 6 years, she's 18, that means she was 12 when you married.  That is more than old enough for her to have her own opinions on who she's being asked to share her home with. Blaming on her mother is a way of evading the fact that you and your husband's decisions pushed her into an unhappy living situation whenever she comes see him.\n\nShe's not obligated to \"bond\" with you, your child, or a half sibling who was born when she was 14 and whom she only sees on weekends.  She's also not obligated to want to bond.\n\nAnd it is a really foolish thing to choose, as a babysitter and housekeeper, a step-daughter whom you know dislikes you, your child, and her half-brother.  If you were hiring normally, you'd reject any applicant who felt about the children the way that you say she feels about them. What on earth made you think that it was suitable to hire her for all-day childcare?\n\nETA: Also, if you fire her, be prepared for her to leave, immediately, to go back to her mother's house, and to look for a proper job.  You can't expect, on Monday, that she'll be there to \"help out\" until you get around to hiring someone properly.  And I expect she'll stop coming on weekends, as well, unless she still has a decent relationship with her father and they arrange 1:1 time that doesn't involve you or the younger kids.", "YTA. Pay her, fire her, and move on.  There's no reason to create more family drama if you don't need to.", "How much you paid her compared to what you would've paid for outsider cleaner & babysitter?", "YTA, you can fire her but you have to pay her for the week.  She could actually sue you and win.", "Yes, YTA. You said she didn\u2019t clean, then you say she wasn\u2019t supposed to clean. You didn\u2019t like how she was performing her job but you didn\u2019t say anything til she had completed the work week. You took advantage of her and now think you can get away with not paying her. ALL of that is assholery. You would not have treated another adult this way, yet think it\u2019s ok because Mia is your husband\u2019s daughter.  You sound like you are an awful person for Mia to deal with. I\u2019ve been a stepparent and regardless of how I got along with his mom (which was not at all) I did not mistreat him. Do better.", "YTA, feel free to fire her, but pay for the time spent. \n\nWere this any commercial sitting or cleaning service, you\u2019d end up paying more in court and collection costs to try and fight it and you\u2019d just pay up first. And we both know it. But you\u2019ll shit on this kid because she\u2019s relatively defenseless. Classy move.", "YTA- Mia is right with respect to the payment. You can fire her, but you can\u2019t steal her wages for time worked especially when you were aware of her poor performance and continued to let her work through the week.", "YTA. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she\u2019s in the wrong for being a neglectful and awful babysitter, but she still performed a job for an agreed payment. You have to pay her for that and then I suggest firing her immediately.", "> Mia and I never got along good, I tried my best but tbh my husband has a spiteful ex who filled Mia\u2019s head with lies about me.\n\nWhy would you blame Mia's mom for why you don't get along with Mia? Isn't Mia capable of forming her own opinion on you?", "YTA, as it's your husband's child, he should have done the talking to and firing. Seriously, how does \"I explained she didn\u2019t try her best, and she was irresponsible.\" make you someone she now wants to work on getting along with?", "YTA.  If you had gotten a real babysitter, you'd still be obligated to pay them before firing them.", "YTA.\n\nSorry she did a crappy job. I understand why you don't think she should be compensated for performing inadequately. But you need to pay her. Your option going forward is to never ask for her help again cuz you don't think she is good at babysitting. It's the same as with any bad employee. You still have to pay them.", "INFO:  Do you realize that Mia could report you to the local department of labor for wage theft?  Also, if you were paying her under the table, she can report you for that?  I will bet that her mom will have her do that.", "YTA. That's wage theft and if it wasn't family it would be a federal crime. You can decide you don't want to keep employing her but you can't withhold wages for a time she worked.", "YTA", "YTA: You set up a payment plan, you keep a promise.", "YTA. Pay her for her time, fire her, and find a trustworthy babysitter.", "Yta", "YTA for not paying for time worked, don\u2019t be surprised when you continue to \u201cbud\u201d heads\u2026", "YTA, she worked, you pay her, then talk about going forward", "I\u2019m not saying YTA or NTA, but give the girl some slack.  She\u2019s just a kid and of course she isn\u2019t going to take \u201cworking\u201d\u2019for you super seriously.  A 12 year old can figure out how to feed itself, btw.\n\nEdit: also you\u2019re just creating more friction in the relationship", "YTA for not paying her. Did she do a good job? It seems the first couple days, yes. The last couple days, no. But she still showed up and was an adult presence so you could be away at work with someone present for your other kids. Was that a low bar? Yes. However, since she stopped taking care of the littlest one, that was a reasonable cause to fire her. But still pay her for her time.\n\nNow, I want to give you a bonus YTA for expecting her to cook and clean on top of watching your other two kids - you tried to make her a nanny, maid and chef under the title of babysitter. That was too much.", "YTA and if you do not pay her, you are no better than a thief, really. You can fire her, but can't not pay her. If your employer did that to you, you would sue and you would have cause. Pay her, fire her, move on", "YTA. Minors aren\u2019t free childcare.", "ESH. She did a poor job, but she was still there, watching the kids. You should have given her *some* payment, and then told her either that she was no longer needed as a babysitter, or that if she didn't up her game, she wouldn't be getting paid next week.", "YTA.", "YTA\nYou can fire her but you need to pay her for her time.\n\nYou noticed things weren\u2019t right and spoke to her, but kept her there, most likely because you had no other options. So she needs to be paid. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t want to pay her, then you should have stopped the arrangement earlier in the week, not wait until the end and decide not to pay her.\n\nI\u2019ll bet that paying a professional service for child care and cleaning/cooking would cost you much more than what you were paying her.", "She agreed to babysit, but then neglects the kids. One gets a rash, and later she just doesn't feed them dinner at all. OP, YTA, for not firing her all together and find a good sitter for them instead.", "ESH. No doubt Mia was a shitty babysitter, but you still need to pay a shitty employee after you made a verbal contract. Do that, and then you can terminate her employment for good.", "ESH\n\nShould've made a partial payment.", "ESH - you agreed to pay her a certain amount to perform certain duties.  It sounds trivial but you really should have had a breakdown for each task; $XX for watching kids, $XX for cooking, $XX for cleaning and so on.  She did show up, she did not perform the tasks to standard, she still should get paid but never asked to come back again for this.", "NTA. You paid for a babysitter, not a person to just sit in the same house as your baby. Your baby might as well have been alone for christ sakes. Everyone here whose saying YTA are lazy people who probably do the least amount of work.", "NTA. All these armchair department of labor employees who are crying wage theft are taking this too literally. This is not an employee/employer relationship. This is a family. In families, the relationship takes precedence (or at least should) over technicalities. \n\nWe\u2019re talking about an 18 year old girl who is being neglectful and entitled. She\u2019s putting her siblings\u2019 well-being at risk, not following through on tasks, yet still demanding payment. Absolutely not. \n\nWe don\u2019t need to get the labor board involved (come on, people). This is a private home, caring for siblings. \n\nBut, if we\u2019re still going to play \u201clabor board\u201d\u2014employees don\u2019t get paid when they clock out on extended lunches. Take that out of her pay. Either that, or tell her to unionize. \ud83d\ude44", "Esh pay her half or all and be done with her watching them or tell her exactly what she did and give her a second chance because she's family", "Nta, I wouldn't at a sitter for not caring for my children or doing the chores agreed upon, why pay her just because she's your stepkid. She's an adult at this point who thought this was a fast easy way to make money without having to out in the effort because she's family so you would still pay her for the work she didn't do. \n\nThis is reality, you don't do the work you don't get the money. \n\nFind a better sitter.\n\nEdit to add:\nThis job is not an hourly wage job, you were paying her a flat amount for specific work. Meaning if the work wasn't done she wouldn't be paid. This is a basic premise in many career fields (mine, my husbands, my fathers). If we don't do the work we are hired for we don't get paid. \n\nIf this was an hourly job like Walmart where she's just paid to be there I would say pay the girl, but it's not. She was being paid to complete specific tasks that she did not complete to your agreed upon expectation.", ">She said she still put her time in and deserves to get paid. \n\nShe's more than old enough to be educated about this life truth: people don't get paid for clocking in and clocking out, you get paid for doing a job which she didn't.\n\nStill ESH, pay her severance and don't hire her anymore.", "NTA.

Mia watched their children meaning she did her job. Did she do a bad job. I would agree that Mia didn\u2019t do a great one.\n\nThen OP should have let her go that first day rather than use her for rest of the week and not pay her. Mia is entitled legally for that payment since they had a verbal contract.\n\nOP is absolutely wrong here. And to do that to her stepdaughter well makes it even worse. She is completely validating what Mia\u2019s mom said about her and furthering the acrimony between them.", "Bold of you to assume OP isn\u2019t trying to push stepdaughter out of the family/her life. This is like Cinderella", "Same! 12 is when my parents started leaving me to babysit my siblings (10M and 2F) for a few hours at a time. Diapers, cooking \u201cmeals\u201d (soup and grilled cheese) \n\nI think that\u2019s about the age I started babysitting neighborhood kids too (it was 25 years ago, my memory is a bit fuzzy. But definitely watched my siblings at 12)", "Now that you mention it, me too. I took the Red Cross babysitting course at my local hospital. I forgot since I don't really do it anymore and didn't get that many jobs at 12.", "I was making food and ironing my clothes with my grandma and also she taught me how to sew.... OP is just the goddamn worst. No wonder her step-daughter doesn't like her. She's a complete dingus.", "> So we're probably talking an impressionable teen/preteen being told stuff by her mom.\n\nSure, but she's now an adult and it's not like OP wouldn't also make an impression on Mia.", "Nah, I hate this take. My sister and I were 10 and 8 when our parents divorced and we made our own decisions not to meet our dad\u2019s new partner. Our mum never said anything bad about her and even tried to open our minds to meeting her but we were having none of it. \n\nMy poor mum was always blamed for filling our heads with reasons not to meet her, but it probably would have been better for her if we had- some time to herself if we could go stay with dad and she also wouldn\u2019t have been accused of poisoning our minds.\n\nI love my mum for respecting what we wanted and taking the fall for it like that and it pisses me off to think people would blame her just because my sister and I were young and she *could* have manipulated us.", "My daughter would get a terrible rash if she drank apple juice, nothing to do with not being changed enough.", "We only have the 12 yo's word that 4 yo tried to get Mia to change him before 12 yo stepped in to try. Mia before this was only with them during the weekends, and is described as not having much to do with her step and half siblings. She may not have a good understanding of what this entailed or what was needed, which would be a failure on all parties. But 4 yo would be more likely to go to the sibling he is more familiar with, in my experience. Who would also be familiar with the signs and could have told Mia. The info that things were going well, then suddenly went bad, makes me suspicious. \n\n\nBut hiring a professional sitter is the best course at this point, I agree.", "A 12 year old should also be able to wake up an 18 year old, I'd say.", "My five year old will feed herself if she\u2019s hungry and I\u2019m in putting the baby to nap. \n\nNot what I would call a *balanced* diet, but edible food product.", "I was confused by this as well. I started babysitting at 11, included cooking cleaning and changing diapers for two kids. The 12 year old in theory should be able to handle this right? Also why is the 4 year old not potty trained? All of my kids were potty trained around age 2.", "By 12, I figured out most of the boxes in the pantry had ***instructions*** to tell you how to make them! It was wonderful! My mom was delighted too, since if I didn't like what she was making, I just asked if I could make something for myself. I'm not fussy, but a couple of the popular family favorite meals I really disliked. I would scarf down raw squid covered in fish eggs, but enchilada casserole was a no go. It's my sibling's favorite meal. We had an electric stove top, so I was allowed to use it to cook, with supervision until I showed I knew what I was doing safely. It's a life skill I'm so happy to have!\n\n\n(A side note: my mom got into the cooking channel about this time. She loved a show called 'Good Eats'. It's little half hour episodes that talk not only about cooking, but the history and science behind the ingredients. It's a little old, but I actually started rewatching some of it recently. It's informative, funny, and got me interested in different kinds of cooking. I still use recipes from it today. If your kid is showing interest in cooking, he might like it. It's on Discovery + or the new HBO max.)", "A 12 year old should be able to feed herself and a 4 year old should be potty trained. These parents suck.", "Right? In our country a 12 year old is considered old enough to be left alone without supervision for short periods because they should be able to care for themselves. \nPlus unless there's disabilities or developmental delays, a four year old should not be in nappies anymore. They might still require help with wiping, sure, but it's not age appropriate to still be in nappies. \n\nIt sounds like these kids are not being taught basic life skills.", "The apology was for the rash. That could have been due to poor training/lack of experience.", "Ok, and you\u2019d be commuting wage theft. If someone showed up to work, no matter how shitty of a job they did, they get paid for that shift. You fire them and don\u2019t pay a dime after that, but you can\u2019t cut someone\u2019a pay prior to their firing just with a snap.", "You have a very different definition of neglect than CPS", "I stand by my comment.", "I\u2019d bet there\u2019s no way OP was paying her stepdaughter anything near $500 a week", "Two kids whom she barely knew.  OP says she was only there on weekends.  And not all weekends - she often preferred to stay at her mothers and be with her friends.  And she hadn't \"bonded\" with either of the younger children, so I doubt she spent much time paying attention to them or learning their needs and how to care for them.  Even if there were \"family\" activities, with a 4 year old and a 12 year old, I doubt they were chosen to appeal to an older teenager, and I expect she opted out rather than spending the day at the playpark watching the kids.  \n\nIf OP wanted Mia to work as a nanny, she needed to provide suitable training for someone with no work or childcare experience to learn what was needed.  Likewise for cooking - she needed to be sure that Mia had the ingredients needed for meals the kids liked, and knew how to prepare those meals, as opposed to the ones that Mia might chose to cook for herself.  And with cleaning, she needed to be trained as to exactly what the expectations were, not just a vague \"keep the house clean.\"  \n\nIn the movie *Mary Poppins*, cook, housekeeper and nanny were three different full-time jobs. (And no, the cook and the housekeeper won't watch the kids on the nanny's day off.)  And at that point in history, orphanages and workhouses would train girls without families on how to do those jobs, so they'd have a marketable skill once they aged out of the system.  They didn't just expect someone with no training or work experience to magically be able to do these jobs.", "My 8 year old can feed herself. The 12 year old not being able to either means she\u2019s coddled and spoiled, or nobody\u2019s taking charge of teaching her to be independent.", "Also, at four I feel like maybe more is going on if he isn\u2019t potty trained and has accidents", "We all know OP is not even close to paying Mia that yet expecting a full on nanny rather than a babysitter.\n\nThen to double down and not even paying her. OP acts so self righteous, indignant and entitled when she is wrongfully mistreating her stepchild. Nevermind being a terrible employer.\n\nThen she tries to blame Mia\u2019s mother for their bad relationship. No, it\u2019s her own behavior and Mia is 100% right on why she should be paid.", "I totally agree. I wanted to skip that part and talk about the consequences.  Sorry I gave the wrong impression.", "Good point. \n\nI was thinking her strategy was to convince her husband Mia sucks, and make him the bad guy, so he pushes her out/Mia leaves. \n\n\u201cAfter a long talk with my husband we decided not to pay her for this week.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy husband and I told her\u2026\u201d", "The only responses I\u2019ve read from OP have been defending the 12 year for not figuring out their own food if they were hungry.", "If it went that far, OP could also take the step daughter to court. If someone ruins your hair in a manner that could be considered intentional (doing something you did not ask for), you can take them to court over it. If someone neglects your kids, you can also take them to court to say you will not pay for the service. Given that the youngest developed a rash, there is clear evidence they were not well cared for.", "Yes, but you as a parent know that and I'm guessing you tell your babysitters that. If you even keep Apple juice in your house at all - most parents don't keep around foods in their house their kids are sensitive to. \n\nI assume OP as a parent knows if their child has a food sensitivity and would let the 18 year old know about it. Asking what you can and can't feed the kids is like rule number one of babysitting. \n\nThe most common cause of diaper rash is sitting in a dirty diaper for too long. It isn't the only cause, but in this case there is no reason to believe that isn't the reason, especially when you have another child saying that is what is happening.", "they literally said she did well the first couple days meaning she just stopped caring, you're giving her too much credit", "The point is it shouldn\u2019t be up to a child to get an adult to do their job. The responsibility shouldn\u2019t be on the 12yo", "I once got in trouble when I was around 5 yo because I midnight-snacked a jar of green olives. Healthy? No. Food? Yes. After that, my parents made better alternatives available. And put the olives on a higher shelf. \n\n\nHowever, it turns out, if I can figure out how to feed myself, I also probably know how to move a chair. \ud83e\udd2b", "Yeah, they\u2019ve been capable of feeding themselves on Saturday morning for years. I mean for the 7 year old it\u2019s Goldfish and if I sleep in a bit sometimes she\u2019s rewarded herself with a popsicle, but I know they won\u2019t starve if I\u2019m sick with the flu for a week!", "totally unrelated to the post but GODS I LOVE GOOD EATS SO MUCH! It just made me really unrationally happy to see some else like it", "True. In a legally binding employer/employee relationship, which this is not. It's \"family\".

The two are not exclusively the same, \"by law\".", "Last time I checked not giving a child food, leaving two minors unattended while you sleep, and not properly caring for the hygiene of a child resulting in a rash is neglect - a social work major (aka the people who work in cps)", "Sorry, I just meant even if you search \"Chicago Nanny rate\" it'll say $16/hr. But current average is $27-35 for a city nanny. $25 in the burbs. Care(dot)com is notoriously horrible for their pricing recommendations! Wanted to warn anyone thinking of googling nanny rates for their area lol", "It's so good! And I still remember random facts about random things! Like, the reason garlic mellows after being cut is that the act of cutting releases chemicals that react to make that sharp fresh garlic flavor. But over time, they degrade into sugars, which is why pre-chopped garlic tastes sweeter, while fresh chopped is spicy.", "Mia could definitely argue that they entered into a salaried employer/employee relationship for the purposes of the babysitting; either by way of verbal agreement (and she could demonstrate this is true given prior payments) or by way of written agreement (if they had text messages describing the arrangement). Either way, OP is an AH regardless", "No problem!\n\nIf you're going to cite numbers, it helps to document your methodology for getting them, even if it is as rudimentary as a Google search. \n\nNo matter where you look, minimum wage, or even $10 an hour, is far less than what OP can expect to pay an unrelated adult for the same work and hours she's asking of Mia."]}
