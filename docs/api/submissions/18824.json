Mia and I never got along good, I tried my best but tbh my husband has a spiteful ex who filled Mia\u2019s head with lies about me. This resulting in Mia and I budding heads often. Along with that, we only got Mia on weekends due to my husband busy work schedule and as she got older she\u2019d rather be with friends. She never really bonded with either of our other children. \n\nMia needed extra money for summer, and we needed a sitter since we would not have child care for the summer so we made an arrangement. We needed help watching the children, and cleaning and cooking while we worked, we paid her a bit extra bc our 4 y.o is still learning with the toilet and needs extra help. The first few days went well, and she was paid as agreed. The next few days came by, and I started noticing Mia wasnt cleaning up as she was requested, infact the house was messier then when we left. We don\u2019t expect just her to clean, but to attend to things our other children were too young to do, which we paid her for. Our 4 y.o is transitioning out of pull ups, bc he does still have some accidents, and I noticed he had a rash, and my 12 y.o admitted to me that Mia didn\u2019t listen when he said he had to go potty, and my 12 y.o helped change him. I spoke to Mia about this and she was very apologetic.\n\nThe final straw was two days ago I came home late and Mia was sleeping, and my 12 y.o said she was really hungry that Mia forgot to make dinner. After a long talk with my husband we decided not to pay her for this week.\n\nMy husband and I told her this and she was furious, she said we wasted her time and that she should atleast be paid because she tried her best. I explained she didn\u2019t try her best, and she was irresponsible. She said she still put her time in and deserves to get paid. We told her that we wouldn\u2019t be, and that was final.

Was there a reason the twelve year old didn\u2019t wake her? \n\nOut of curiosity, what are you paying her for babysitting two children, cooking, cleaning the house, and potty training a four year old? At eighteen, if she did not have experience with kids, she may be on a learning curve.", "YTA. If you didn\u2019t like her work you should have fired her. Instead you had her continue working the whole week. You owe her. Also, what are things around your household that your 12 year old is not old enough to do, but your 18 year old is? Why can\u2019t the 12 year old make his own food? No wonder she doesn\u2019t like you. Your husband is equally as sucky for signing off on this.", "YTA if a boss fires an employee they don\u2019t get to refuse to pay them for the previous week! They can fire them on the spot, but the employee still gets paid for the time they were at work. PERIOD", "YTA\n\nShe put in the time.  Pay her because she was there, then fire her and hire a different babysitter.\n\nJust what are you paying her?  You're asking not just for babysitting, but for cooking and cleaning as well.  How much would you pay a legally hired unrelated adult housekeeper to do all the things you're asking her to do, for the amount of time you're asking from her?\n\nAnd how does what you pay compare to what she could get at a different summer job, outside the house, if she wasn't helping you?  What about hours?  If you're working eight hour shifts, you're expecting her to start work when you leave for work, and keep working until after your commute home.  That's probably a ten hour day.  And then you sometimes show up late.  That is not how a good employer treats an employee.  (And are you paying time-and-a-half for overtime over 40 hours, as a regular employer would do?)\n\nI suspect you're paying her somewhat less than she could make elsewhere, and a lot less than you'd pay if you legally hired a housekeeper (proper bookkeeping, taxes, etc.) to do the same task.\n\nIf you're paying her under the table, you're also not taking care of things like social security and establishing, legally, that she's employed at this time, which could affect her retirement in the future. (If you are in the US.)\n\nThis job also does absolutely nothing for her when it comes to building her resume and work history, giving her one less reason to put herself out too much for this.\n\nAlso, you say she hasn't bonded with you or your children. That's okay.  She didn't marry you, her father did.  She made no vows or commitments.  You've been married for 6 years, she's 18, that means she was 12 when you married.  That is more than old enough for her to have her own opinions on who she's being asked to share her home with. Blaming on her mother is a way of evading the fact that you and your husband's decisions pushed her into an unhappy living situation whenever she comes see him.\n\nShe's not obligated to \"bond\" with you, your child, or a half sibling who was born when she was 14 and whom she only sees on weekends.  She's also not obligated to want to bond.\n\nAnd it is a really foolish thing to choose, as a babysitter and housekeeper, a step-daughter whom you know dislikes you, your child, and her half-brother.  If you were hiring normally, you'd reject any applicant who felt about the children the way that you say she feels about them. What on earth made you think that it was suitable to hire her for all-day childcare?\n\nETA: Also, if you fire her, be prepared for her to leave, immediately, to go back to her mother's house, and to look for a proper job.  You can't expect, on Monday, that she'll be there to \"help out\" until you get around to hiring someone properly.  And I expect she'll stop coming on weekends, as well, unless she still has a decent relationship with her father and they arrange 1:1 time that doesn't involve you or the younger kids.", "YTA. Pay her, fire her, and move on.  There's no reason to create more family drama if you don't need to.", "How much you paid her compared to what you would've paid for outsider cleaner & babysitter?", "YTA, you can fire her but you have to pay her for the week.  She could actually sue you and win.", "Yes, YTA. You said she didn\u2019t clean, then you say she wasn\u2019t supposed to clean. You didn\u2019t like how she was performing her job but you didn\u2019t say anything til she had completed the work week. You took advantage of her and now think you can get away with not paying her. ALL of that is assholery. You would not have treated another adult this way, yet think it\u2019s ok because Mia is your husband\u2019s daughter.  You sound like you are an awful person for Mia to deal with. I\u2019ve been a stepparent and regardless of how I got along with his mom (which was not at all) I did not mistreat him. Do better.", "YTA, feel free to fire her, but pay for the time spent. \n\nWere this any commercial sitting or cleaning service, you\u2019d end up paying more in court and collection costs to try and fight it and you\u2019d just pay up first. And we both know it. But you\u2019ll shit on this kid because she\u2019s relatively defenseless. Classy move.", "YTA- Mia is right with respect to the payment. You can fire her, but you can\u2019t steal her wages for time worked especially when you were aware of her poor performance and continued to let her work through the week.", "YTA. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she\u2019s in the wrong for being a neglectful and awful babysitter, but she still performed a job for an agreed payment. You have to pay her for that and then I suggest firing her immediately.", "> Mia and I never got along good, I tried my best but tbh my husband has a spiteful ex who filled Mia\u2019s head with lies about me.\n\nWhy would you blame Mia's mom for why you don't get along with Mia? Isn't Mia capable of forming her own opinion on you?", "YTA, as it's your husband's child, he should have done the talking to and firing. Seriously, how does \"I explained she didn\u2019t try her best, and she was irresponsible.\" make you someone she now wants to work on getting along with?", "YTA.  If you had gotten a real babysitter, you'd still be obligated to pay them before firing them.", "YTA.\n\nSorry she did a crappy job. I understand why you don't think she should be compensated for performing inadequately. But you need to pay her. Your option going forward is to never ask for her help again cuz you don't think she is good at babysitting. It's the same as with any bad employee. You still have to pay them.", "INFO:  Do you realize that Mia could report you to the local department of labor for wage theft?  Also, if you were paying her under the table, she can report you for that?  I will bet that her mom will have her do that.", "YTA. That's wage theft and if it wasn't family it would be a federal crime. You can decide you don't want to keep employing her but you can't withhold wages for a time she worked.", "YTA", "YTA: You set up a payment plan, you keep a promise.", "YTA. Pay her for her time, fire her, and find a trustworthy babysitter.", "Yta", "YTA for not paying for time worked, don\u2019t be surprised when you continue to \u201cbud\u201d heads\u2026", "YTA, she worked, you pay her, then talk about going forward", "I\u2019m not saying YTA or NTA, but give the girl some slack.  She\u2019s just a kid and of course she isn\u2019t going to take \u201cworking\u201d\u2019for you super seriously.  A 12 year old can figure out how to feed itself, btw.\n\nEdit: also you\u2019re just creating more friction in the relationship", "YTA for not paying her. Did she do a good job? It seems the first couple days, yes. The last couple days, no. But she still showed up and was an adult presence so you could be away at work with someone present for your other kids. Was that a low bar? Yes. However, since she stopped taking care of the littlest one, that was a reasonable cause to fire her. But still pay her for her time.\n\nNow, I want to give you a bonus YTA for expecting her to cook and clean on top of watching your other two kids - you tried to make her a nanny, maid and chef under the title of babysitter. That was too much.", "YTA and if you do not pay her, you are no better than a thief, really. You can fire her, but can't not pay her. If your employer did that to you, you would sue and you would have cause. Pay her, fire her, move on", "YTA. Minors aren\u2019t free childcare.", "ESH. She did a poor job, but she was still there, watching the kids. You should have given her *some* payment, and then told her either that she was no longer needed as a babysitter, or that if she didn't up her game, she wouldn't be getting paid next week.", "YTA.", "YTA\nYou can fire her but you need to pay her for her time.\n\nYou noticed things weren\u2019t right and spoke to her, but kept her there, most likely because you had no other options. So she needs to be paid. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t want to pay her, then you should have stopped the arrangement earlier in the week, not wait until the end and decide not to pay her.\n\nI\u2019ll bet that paying a professional service for child care and cleaning/cooking would cost you much more than what you were paying her.", "She agreed to babysit, but then neglects the kids. One gets a rash, and later she just doesn't feed them dinner at all. OP, YTA, for not firing her all together and find a good sitter for them instead.", "ESH. No doubt Mia was a shitty babysitter, but you still need to pay a shitty employee after you made a verbal contract. Do that, and then you can terminate her employment for good.", "ESH\n\nShould've made a partial payment.", "ESH - you agreed to pay her a certain amount to perform certain duties.  It sounds trivial but you really should have had a breakdown for each task; $XX for watching kids, $XX for cooking, $XX for cleaning and so on.  She did show up, she did not perform the tasks to standard, she still should get paid but never asked to come back again for this.", "NTA. You paid for a babysitter, not a person to just sit in the same house as your baby. Your baby might as well have been alone for christ sakes. Everyone here whose saying YTA are lazy people who probably do the least amount of work.", "NTA. All these armchair department of labor employees who are crying wage theft are taking this too literally. This is not an employee/employer relationship. This is a family. In families, the relationship takes precedence (or at least should) over technicalities. \n\nWe\u2019re talking about an 18 year old girl who is being neglectful and entitled. She\u2019s putting her siblings\u2019 well-being at risk, not following through on tasks, yet still demanding payment. Absolutely not. \n\nWe don\u2019t need to get the labor board involved (come on, people). This is a private home, caring for siblings. \n\nBut, if we\u2019re still going to play \u201clabor board\u201d\u2014employees don\u2019t get paid when they clock out on extended lunches. Take that out of her pay. Either that, or tell her to unionize. \ud83d\ude44", "Esh pay her half or all and be done with her watching them or tell her exactly what she did and give her a second chance because she's family", "Nta, I wouldn't at a sitter for not caring for my children or doing the chores agreed upon, why pay her just because she's your stepkid. She's an adult at this point who thought this was a fast easy way to make money without having to out in the effort because she's family so you would still pay her for the work she didn't do. \n\nThis is reality, you don't do the work you don't get the money. \n\nFind a better sitter.\n\nEdit to add:\nThis job is not an hourly wage job, you were paying her a flat amount for specific work. Meaning if the work wasn't done she wouldn't be paid. This is a basic premise in many career fields (mine, my husbands, my fathers). If we don't do the work we are hired for we don't get paid. \n\nIf this was an hourly job like Walmart where she's just paid to be there I would say pay the girl, but it's not. She was being paid to complete specific tasks that she did not complete to your agreed upon expectation.", ">She said she still put her time in and deserves to get paid. \n\nShe's more than old enough to be educated about this life truth: people don't get paid for clocking in and clocking out, you get paid for doing a job which she didn't.\n\nStill ESH, pay her severance and don't hire her anymore.", "NTA.

I get what youre saying that you cant cover all the bases, but when dealing with young people that have little to no work experience, not to mention personality issues, I would spell out the tasks and put a price on each.", "I guess the difference i see is that this isn't contractual. For an example, if you asked a hairdresser to get blonde highlights and instead they bleached your whole head and fried all of your hair off, are you still going to pay them? No you'd be furious. I see where you're coming from but i think this is one of those times.", "Is it illegal if she didn't sign a contract and gave her social security and will recieve a W2 tax form", "If they didn't do the work they're being paid to do they wouldn't get paid...", "Let's not act like this is like working at Best Buy. It's not. Those jobs pay you for the hours you do. This is more like contracting or construction, you get paid for the work you do, if you don't do the work you don't get paid to just be there.", "If she got $10 an hour with no overtime that would be $500 a week. Should we take bets on if she was getting $500?", "Google is notoriously wrong too. If they live anywhere near a big city it's minimum $20/hr! No way OP was paying anywhere close to what Mia was owed.", "My guess is also no, that\u2019s why I asked. Then OP mentioned coming home late, I thought this is rotten, Mia was probably there a long time and a 12 year old can feed herself or wake Mia up or both.", "I think that\u2019s a very good idea. To be fair I also think there should be talk of pay after 8 hours or when parents are late unexpectedly. Mia is an adult and allowed to make plans after work and it should not just be assumed that she will stay until whenever they get there.", "If it went to the department of labor, OP would be in a lot of trouble.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a perfect analogy, but point taken.", "Verbal contracts are also legally binding and enforceable", "Yes.  More illegal.  She could also report her for tax fraud.", "Your not getting paid for producing a product here. You\u2019re not installing air conditioners or roofing where there is a finished product, so no it is not that. Those jobs are based on completion of a job. This is not.", "Which is why I specified that the number I found was a national average.\n\nThe average rate where I live is about a dollar less an hour.  In high cost of living cities, it's certainly much higher.  Federal minimum wage is scheduled to go up to $9.50/hour on July 1.  In many states, it is higher.", "If the children were in a commercial daycare, the daycare would not be providing them with supper.  The parents would be responsible for that, after they're done with work.  The parents would also be expected to provide breakfast before daycare.  And perhaps pack a lunch and snacks.  The daycare center would not be sending someone into the home to clean and cook.\n\nAnd they could lose the placement of their kids in a daycare if they were routinely late picking them up.  \n\nOP has been expecting more from Mia than a daycare center would provide, and is probably paying her much less than a daycare center costs.", "I agree, good catch", "Some daycares do provide meals, to be fair. They have to follow nutrition guidelines provided by the state and parents have the option of sending meals from home if they prefer (like school lunches or lunch from home). \n\nAlso I would also like to add that in the state I live in, I have taught the grade that starts with 4 year olds and they are required to be fully potty trained but that\u2019s not daycare, that\u2019s school. 4 year olds are capable unless there is a special health reason.", "And they charge extra for those meals, as well, unless they're a government subsidized daycare or Head Start program that is funded for meals.  \n\nAnd it is probably only lunch and snacks, maybe breakfast, but probably not three full meals a day."]}
