Since then, I've been at home, raising my daughter. Now that she's older, I decided to get a part-time afternoon job, so that my husband (40m) could watch over our daughter while I worked. At first, I found a job at pastry shop, but the owner was terribly rude and I was working overtime (unpaid) every single day, so I left. \n\nI've started working at a burger joint, and I actually really enjoy it. The problems started when a started going to work 15 min earlier and leaving a little later, in order to get to know my co-workers. Everyone has been really welcoming and helpful, and I felt rude leaving the second my shift was over, while everyone else was staying for a bit to chat. My husband said that he was ok with me going in a little early, but that's it.\n\nYesterday, I was working until midnight. We were really understaffed and I didn't even get my break or even drank a cup of water during my whole shift. At midnight, my manager asked me to stay for another hour, so I did.\n\nThe second I entered the crew room, I heard my phone ringing. It was my husband. I grabbed my jacket and called him back. I told him that I just got off work and how busy it was. He asked me if I knew where he was and I didn't understand the question, until I saw him with our 3-year-old, a minute away from my job, at 1 in the morning... \n\nHe started yelling at me and saying that I should have called him, that he was worried and that things have to change, because things will get worse. He also forbade me calling him while he's at work (he works for himself. He has an office). \n\nAt some point, I tried to calm things down by apologising for not notifying him, and explained to him that I couldn't go to the crew room, because I was at the register. He said that he didn't accept the apology and we haven't talked since. \n\nAm I really that much of an AH for not notifying him of working an extra hour?\n\nP.S.: My job is 2 blocks from our home, and I walk one of the most well lit and busier streets to get there.\n\nUPDATE: He called me. He apologised for overreacting. He said that he was worried, but he also has trouble adjusting to caring for our kid for long hours and having to be the one putting her to bed. I apologised for not informing him and promised to do so in the future.\nI hope things will get better...", "created_utc": 1676460251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112vtig/aita_for_not_notifying_my_husband_about_my/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not picking up your phone, it's the middle of the night and something bad could've happened to you. The only thing he could do was come to your work to check and bring the kid with him. What else was he supposed to do?!", "ESH it definitely seems like his reaction was a bit over the top, but I would be upset and worried if my person didn\u2019t come home when I was expecting them too. Taking one minute to send a quick text \u201chey working an extra hour for some OT, call/text you when I can/when I get off.\u201d would be the thing to do.", "YTA", "ESH this is why. You could have said to your manager when he asked you to stay longer that you needed a minute to inform your husband. You were hour late home at midnight, I understand he was worried. He could have however behaved like a normal adult, not yelling  like a madman. He was most likely afraid and fear is a powerful feeling that can make people act badly. Maybe you should both act like adults and talk to each other.", "info: What does he mean by things will get worse? He already sounds like an overbearing ass. \n\nGranted, you should have sent a text to let him know you would be late, but this kind of reaction is concerning.", "ESH \n\nI work in A&E. Two kids and hubby at home. No matter how busy I am, if I am going to be off late it takes less than 30 seconds to send a text. Anything could've happened to you on the way home, no matter how \"safe\" it is. He was probably angry with worry and overreacted, hence he is the AH too. \n\nAlso it sounds like he was angry because he wasn't informed, not because you worked late?", "ESH. You should have taken a minute to notify him that you were going to stay late. However, he should not shout at you. Rather, he should explain why he is upset. \n\nA bonus afterthought, he does sound a little controlling by banning you from contacting him while he is at work.", "ESH.\n\nHe overreacted, but it is completely reasonable to be worried when you're expecting someone home and they don't show up (particularly when you're currently looking after small children and need the other parent so you can get some backup / a break - i.e. to be 50% on rather than 100% on). It's easy to see why that turns into anger on discovering that you made a decision to be home late and didn't let him know about it - and a certain amount of anger is also, frankly, ok for that, but it sounds like this has gone a bit overboard. Have there been similar arguments in the past?\n\nYou should have let him know. He needs to know you'll be later than expected and that he'll be solely in charge of your child for that time. Yes, you are both parents and share equal responsibility for the child, but you do need to communicate about it and dumping anyone with unexpected extra time on their own is unfair. If a manager is asking you to stay for overtime, it's not unreasonable to say you need to let someone know about it.\n\nWithout a child involved, it would still be inconsiderate not to let him know, but slightly less ah-ish.", "Info request:\nI've never worked this kind of job, and America sucks for workers, so to confirm, there was no way for you to notify him without getting fired?", "ESH. It\u2019s unfair to work extra hours at that time of night without letting your husband know the change of plans. He was possibly unnecessarily worried. Your husband does sound like a controlling AH though", "I fell you could have asked the manager for a break to 1) get a darn drink of water\n2. Notify your husband that your working late so he doesn\u2019t worry. If you\u2019re in the US management is required by law to allow you a break. Usually after 4 hours of work. If not in the US I don\u2019t know the work laws and I\u2019m sorry for that. I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re the AH because you really sound like you\u2019re trying to be a good worker and also trying to make some friends along the way too! \nI\u2019m going against the grain here and saying \nNTA \n\nYou\u2019re husband is overreacting and taking his anger too far. I\u2019d get some help for that if I were him.", "NTA. Judging from how he is quick to anger, he seems untrusting of you. Probably thinks you are out to cheat on him, or can't stand to take care of his child on his own for an extra hour.", "ESH- \n\nYou could've taken 30 seconds to text and let your husband know you were gong to be late. Sounds like your husband is a bit controlling though. Maybe he doesn't wasn't you staying after and talking because you having friends will take away from him and his needs.", "NTA. You tried to explain to him how busy your shift was and not even being able to have a break. He proceeded to yell at you\u2026 You didn\u2019t even get the chance to get a word in. He is the a-hole", "NTA but if they ask you to work over tell them you need to send a quick text letting family know. Tell him you will send a text and he can check for it. That way if they are asleep you won\u2019t wake anyone up. Same way with him at work, text.", "NTA - he sounds incredibly controlling and insecure. You're not to dare disturb him during his work day, but YOU better contact him during your work day should any changes arise. I honestly don't feel like he was concerned \"something was wrong\" as much as he was likely toying with the idea that you were being unfaithful. Given how he seemingly treats you, maybe he should be worried you'll find someone who actually knows how to treat their partner properly. \n\nIf he was that worried that you weren't answering your phone, he could've called your job to get into contact with you.\n\nAlso, what is with his threat of \"things have to change or they will get worse\"?", "YTA.  He can't sleep until you are home.  Lack of communication aside...\n\nWorking the closing shift at fast food is not compatible with the lifestyle of being married with children.  You need to find a new job that allows the whole family to go to bed at roughly the same time.  And no, after midnight is not  a good time for the whole family to go to bed.", "ESH. You for taking on an afternoon job that requires you to be at work late at night. Your husband for carrying on like an overbearing control freak (to be fair, he was probably worried sick about you - well-lit, busy street or not, people do go missing). Your manager for not giving you a break, expecting you to work for longer and not giving you a moment to let your husband know you\u2019d be late.

If you're asked to work late just take the 30 seconds to call or text and inform him of that.", "[deleted]", "NTA at all, we can't always use our phones on the job and your husband knows that. It's ok to worry, specially because it's a late shift, but you're an adult and he's overreacting. His behavior is sounding kinda controlling and that's unacceptable, you're a grown up woman and he can't create rules over your life like he's your parent. I think there's more to it that he's actually saying, maybe he's jealous or even wanting you to quit your job (maybe because he's tired of looking after your kid?).

How would he feel if you started to dictate his schedule?", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nIf he literally forbade you from calling him at work, he is being ridiculous.

That's a red flag.", "true, but the fact he's pressuring her - basically saying \"change or else\" doesn't justify it. it only seems he is panicked not because she might no be safe but because he can't control her from faraway. with this new job his ego is being destabilised. i mean he has a job himself he should understand that sometimes events are unpredictable..", "Wait? I'd told him I could be working overtime if it got too busy, and I had been working overtime at previous job almost daily, with no problems. I never notified him before, since I couldn't use my phone during work. Plus, the way home from my other job could actually be dangerous, unlike my current route.", "In many places, especially if you're working with customers, you're not allowed to have your phone with you during a shift.

If it's not too busy, you can a ask to get it at the end of the shift, so you can leave earlier.

Even the manager. \nAlso, yesterday, was the first time I was at the register for the whole shift (before that, I was at the register for an hour and it was not busy at all), so I was stressed about that as well, since I didn't know everything and I really do want to be be a valuable worker. \nUpdate: he called and agreed that he overreacted and he has trouble adjusting caring for our daughter alone and I apologised for not informing him.", "To be fair, unexpected \"you're still the sole parent in charge of this child for an extra unknown amount of time\" is really unfair and sucks for anyone, no matter how happy you are to do parenting.", "Thank you.

You guys are married and a team.  Teams work together.  It's common courtesy to let others know when you'll be late.  I'm glad you're so helpful at your new job,  and making friends,  but remeber that you're not going to be well liked if you drop your personal life for work,  you're setting yourself up to build resentment either with your husband ( that's already happening btw) and your coworkers when you can't cover. \nJobs come and go,  family isn't that fluid, so determine what your priorities are.", "It might be best to establish boundaries? Such as stating that there is no need to worry about calling unless its over 2 hours (because at that point it would be worrying why you have not yet returned without a message).\n\nIf he is still angry due to this...then there is another reason to why he is being so demanding and angry about you working overtime", "I mean he sounds controlling. He doesn't want her around other people because once she has friends she is no longer trapped.", "What would you do if you were expecting him home at a certain time and he was approaching an hour late without letting you know? At that point, are you shrugging your shoulders or are you worried that something bad might have happened?", "Correct, he demands you cannot call him while he's at his job, yet you absolutely must be available for him while at your job? \n\nI'm still curious on his threat of things getting worse if you could elaborate?", "What would it have helped if he called, you said you couldn't go to the crew room to call him so his call wouldn't be answered.", "A woman can work any hours she wants to.  However, statistics clearly indicate that if hubby and wife go to bed at different times...then they will be divorced soon...or just stuck in a failed marriage because nobody has the motivation to do the paperwork.

I'm glad he'll work on it and support your job, since it's the only reasonable solution imo -- you also deserve to be able to work and have a life outside being a mom, if that's what you feel you need right now. Best of luck and hope you guys can help each other, since raising a kid it's a hard job that's needs co-operation of everyone involved.", "Did you have a discussion before you started working? You say you decided, and that your husband could look after you child while you worked - presumably after having already worked a full day himself? Was this a joint decision, or your decision?", "Sounds like red pill/incel bullshit", "Yes. We get paid for overtime and it's the first time I've worked overtime there. I wasn't paid at my previous job.", "\\^ This. The two of you need to communicate about your expectations around sudden changes of plan and messaging. \n\nIt may well be different between this and the pastry shop, depends on timing and what's normal and whatever else. Or this may be the culmination of something that has been frustrating for a very long time.\n\nAnd it needs to be an agreement between the two of you, not you dictating something. You need to agree on what's reasonable for being unexpectedly late without letting the other know (given what might be normal for work vs \"if something bad happened how long until you'd want me to be worried\" and the impact on the other partner in terms of childcare and their time - bear in mind being the only adult in charge of a child is a different prospect from being one of two).", "Thanks, makes sense. I misinterpreted it.", "Ok, he just called and he said that he has trouble adjusting to caring for our daughter for such a lengthy time and that he overreacted.

If working different hours/going to sleep at different times is the cause of divorce, the marriage was going to fail on its own.
