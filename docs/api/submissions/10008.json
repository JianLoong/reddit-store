What else was he supposed to do?!", "ESH it definitely seems like his reaction was a bit over the top, but I would be upset and worried if my person didn\u2019t come home when I was expecting them too.

You could have said to your manager when he asked you to stay longer that you needed a minute to inform your husband. You were hour late home at midnight, I understand he was worried. He could have however behaved like a normal adult, not yelling  like a madman. He was most likely afraid and fear is a powerful feeling that can make people act badly. Maybe you should both act like adults and talk to each other.", "info: What does he mean by things will get worse? He already sounds like an overbearing ass. \n\nGranted, you should have sent a text to let him know you would be late, but this kind of reaction is concerning.", "ESH \n\nI work in A&E. Two kids and hubby at home. No matter how busy I am, if I am going to be off late it takes less than 30 seconds to send a text. Anything could've happened to you on the way home, no matter how \"safe\" it is. He was probably angry with worry and overreacted, hence he is the AH too. \n\nAlso it sounds like he was angry because he wasn't informed, not because you worked late?", "ESH. You should have taken a minute to notify him that you were going to stay late. However, he should not shout at you. Rather, he should explain why he is upset. \n\nA bonus afterthought, he does sound a little controlling by banning you from contacting him while he is at work.", "ESH.\n\nHe overreacted, but it is completely reasonable to be worried when you're expecting someone home and they don't show up (particularly when you're currently looking after small children and need the other parent so you can get some backup / a break - i.e. to be 50% on rather than 100% on). It's easy to see why that turns into anger on discovering that you made a decision to be home late and didn't let him know about it - and a certain amount of anger is also, frankly, ok for that, but it sounds like this has gone a bit overboard. Have there been similar arguments in the past?\n\nYou should have let him know. He needs to know you'll be later than expected and that he'll be solely in charge of your child for that time. Yes, you are both parents and share equal responsibility for the child, but you do need to communicate about it and dumping anyone with unexpected extra time on their own is unfair. If a manager is asking you to stay for overtime, it's not unreasonable to say you need to let someone know about it.\n\nWithout a child involved, it would still be inconsiderate not to let him know, but slightly less ah-ish.", "Info request:\nI've never worked this kind of job, and America sucks for workers, so to confirm, there was no way for you to notify him without getting fired?", "ESH. It\u2019s unfair to work extra hours at that time of night without letting your husband know the change of plans. He was possibly unnecessarily worried. Your husband does sound like a controlling AH though", "I fell you could have asked the manager for a break to 1) get a darn drink of water\n2. Notify your husband that your working late so he doesn\u2019t worry. If you\u2019re in the US management is required by law to allow you a break. Usually after 4 hours of work. If not in the US I don\u2019t know the work laws and I\u2019m sorry for that. I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re the AH because you really sound like you\u2019re trying to be a good worker and also trying to make some friends along the way too! \nI\u2019m going against the grain here and saying \nNTA \n\nYou\u2019re husband is overreacting and taking his anger too far. I\u2019d get some help for that if I were him.", "NTA. Judging from how he is quick to anger, he seems untrusting of you.

You're not to dare disturb him during his work day, but YOU better contact him during your work day should any changes arise.

Given how he seemingly treats you, maybe he should be worried you'll find someone who actually knows how to treat their partner properly. \n\nIf he was that worried that you weren't answering your phone, he could've called your job to get into contact with you.\n\nAlso, what is with his threat of \"things have to change or they will get worse\"?", "YTA.  He can't sleep until you are home.  Lack of communication aside...\n\nWorking the closing shift at fast food is not compatible with the lifestyle of being married with children.

You for taking on an afternoon job that requires you to be at work late at night.

It's the yelling, refusing to accept an apology and the silent treatment. \n\nNot calling was a minor innocent oversight. He blew it was out of proportion. He is an asshole and probably a control freak.", " The normal response would be to call the restaurant  He didn't, probably because he didn't want to seem controlling. Instead he dragged his small child out in the early hours to hover around outside her work. Nope, I'm not buying that he was worried. In fact that, and his statement that things will get worse, sound slightly intimidating to me.", "Working a job at a fast food joint, is one of those jobs where you NEED to get breaks and water. When I worked at McDonalds (*in Europe to be fair where workers rights are more strict compared to the US although still not great*) they had to give us a break or let us go home early if we didn't get it.\n\nAnd the whole \"everyone staying after work to hang\" your managers are encouraging this because it's easier to get you guys to work overtime without complaints. You should consider looking for a new job that actually has hours that are compatible with your lifestyle. Because with fast food, they'll have you doing 12 hour back-to-back shifts with no breaks ever if they can.", "Yeah I've been there. Did a full 7pm to 4am shift with no proper break and no food because we were so busy, and I got so overwhelmed that I forgot. (Super illegal here but I was 18 and didn't know better). When you work busy hospitality time flies by - you should check your local labour laws though, a good employer will make *sure* you get your breaks because they can get in a lot of hot water if you don't.   \nBut I also get why your partner would be stressed. I think this is an NAH situation as long as you work on communicating in the future.", "[removed]", "Sending a text takes a few seconds.", "That\u2019s their point. He seems controlling.", "This was midnight, he was probably worried something bad happened to you.  How can you not see that!?!???", "If you're worried and they aren't answering the phone at 1 am, call the restaurant! I work food service and we absolutely have coworkers family so this when we're super late and busy. We are allowed to have our phones on our person so it doesn't happen super often. But it does happen, and everyone that works there knows and has told the people that need to know that the store phone number and then the option that they need to press to actually get to our store and not the dispatch center is the best way to reach people in an emergency.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

We came to an understanding (hopefully)... I've updated my post.", "I agree it could be, I see it that way because of my ex. This is exactly how he reacted for that very reason. Taints my perspective in some ways I'm sure but also makes me see other things clear.", "Ok. It was just unclear from your wording, so I needed to check. I wasn\u2019t sure if he felt like he hadn\u2019t had a say in things and that was the reason for the reaction. \n\nMy other question is, if he works during the day, and you work evenings/nights, when do you and your husband get time together? That could be another factor, he\u2019s missing you.", "In light of some of the comments I've read here, I just wanted to add that it seems you and your husband have both recognized how you can improve (you letting them know in the future and him handling the responsibility of caring for your daughter better), so put your mind at peace and ignore the overly negative comments being left here.  This situation was a misunderstanding and you are already working on communicating better.  At the end of the day, nobody here knows your reality better than you and your husband.  Some people lack empathy and double standards are often notorious.  The rules are clear about not down voting comments you disagree with and instead up voting the ones you find interesting, but apparently the idea that a woman has the same right to work/have a life and a father has the same responsibility as a mother is a little absurd for half a dozen people.  Don't let unreasonable people bring you down, you and your husband have already taken the necessary steps to improve."]}
