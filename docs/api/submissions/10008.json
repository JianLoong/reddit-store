You could have said to your manager when he asked you to stay longer that you needed a minute to inform your husband. You were hour late home at midnight, I understand he was worried. He could have however behaved like a normal adult, not yelling  like a madman. He was most likely afraid and fear is a powerful feeling that can make people act badly. Maybe you should both act like adults and talk to each other.", "info: What does he mean by things will get worse? He already sounds like an overbearing ass. \n\nGranted, you should have sent a text to let him know you would be late, but this kind of reaction is concerning.", "ESH \n\nI work in A&E. Two kids and hubby at home. No matter how busy I am, if I am going to be off late it takes less than 30 seconds to send a text. Anything could've happened to you on the way home, no matter how \"safe\" it is. He was probably angry with worry and overreacted, hence he is the AH too. \n\nAlso it sounds like he was angry because he wasn't informed, not because you worked late?", "ESH. You should have taken a minute to notify him that you were going to stay late. However, he should not shout at you. Rather, he should explain why he is upset. \n\nA bonus afterthought, he does sound a little controlling by banning you from contacting him while he is at work.", "ESH.\n\nHe overreacted, but it is completely reasonable to be worried when you're expecting someone home and they don't show up (particularly when you're currently looking after small children and need the other parent so you can get some backup / a break - i.e. to be 50% on rather than 100% on). It's easy to see why that turns into anger on discovering that you made a decision to be home late and didn't let him know about it - and a certain amount of anger is also, frankly, ok for that, but it sounds like this has gone a bit overboard. Have there been similar arguments in the past?\n\nYou should have let him know. He needs to know you'll be later than expected and that he'll be solely in charge of your child for that time. Yes, you are both parents and share equal responsibility for the child, but you do need to communicate about it and dumping anyone with unexpected extra time on their own is unfair. If a manager is asking you to stay for overtime, it's not unreasonable to say you need to let someone know about it.\n\nWithout a child involved, it would still be inconsiderate not to let him know, but slightly less ah-ish.", "Info request:\nI've never worked this kind of job, and America sucks for workers, so to confirm, there was no way for you to notify him without getting fired?", "ESH. It\u2019s unfair to work extra hours at that time of night without letting your husband know the change of plans. He was possibly unnecessarily worried. Your husband does sound like a controlling AH though", "I fell you could have asked the manager for a break to 1) get a darn drink of water\n2. Notify your husband that your working late so he doesn\u2019t worry. If you\u2019re in the US management is required by law to allow you a break. Usually after 4 hours of work. If not in the US I don\u2019t know the work laws and I\u2019m sorry for that. I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re the AH because you really sound like you\u2019re trying to be a good worker and also trying to make some friends along the way too! \nI\u2019m going against the grain here and saying \nNTA \n\nYou\u2019re husband is overreacting and taking his anger too far. I\u2019d get some help for that if I were him.", "NTA. Judging from how he is quick to anger, he seems untrusting of you.

You're not to dare disturb him during his work day, but YOU better contact him during your work day should any changes arise.

Given how he seemingly treats you, maybe he should be worried you'll find someone who actually knows how to treat their partner properly. \n\nIf he was that worried that you weren't answering your phone, he could've called your job to get into contact with you.\n\nAlso, what is with his threat of \"things have to change or they will get worse\"?", "YTA.  He can't sleep until you are home.  Lack of communication aside...\n\nWorking the closing shift at fast food is not compatible with the lifestyle of being married with children.

You for taking on an afternoon job that requires you to be at work late at night.

In any food industry, there is no hard clock out. You cannot tell if there will be many people ordering food at midnight or if the place will be dead.  Therefore, if it is dead, you may be allowed to clock out early. If the restaurant gets very busy, you will be asked to stay. Simple. That's how the restaurant business has been since my mother has been a waitress in the 1970s. But I am thinking this is a control issue and there are numerous red flags. Is this because the OP is working in the food industry for minimum wage? What if she was the mayor and the meeting with the city counselors went overtime? Would he show up with a baby then too? Not likely. She would not be able to pick up her phone during that meeting either. The fact that he yells at her, like a dog?  Ouch. Pretty scary. Yelling is abuse! (It is not even permitted in our home. Wanna yell? Go for a walk or a run) The fact that he tells her what she \"should\" have done? The fact that he \"forbids\" her from calling him at work?  The fact that she apologizes and he refuses it?  Holy red flags! Even worse, a minimum wage job, and a child in the picture, leaves many opportunities for control and abuse. You're not the AH, but your husband is. Nobody deserves to yell at you. If he has anger issues, he needs to learn to deal with those in a healthy manner and not act like a 4-year-old.

Next we have the very idea of expecting a restaurant worker to get off at a set time every shift, maybe this place is different but after over a decade of working in restaurants I have never ever had that be the case. You get off when you they don't need you anymore, so perhaps he just needs to alter his expectations and not get worried until say a half an hour after the place has closed.
