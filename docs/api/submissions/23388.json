Make that a rule for yourself - if you\u2019ve already been generous and loaned someone cash, you do not loan more until you have been repaid. Ever.", "I would pay $150 gladly to get rid of some money grabbing punk kid rapper trying to borrow my money all the time..", "NTA", "He sounds like a trash person and it sounds like a one sided friendship. You were dumb to loan him money a second time. Cut ties with the loser and better yourself.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nDude took money and then blew it.\n\nHe needs to pay it back", "NTA. Cut the leech off", "NTA. The first refusal would\u2019ve been NC time for me. Especially when he already owed me. $150, even in your situation, is a cheap price to pay to find out who someone truly is.", "NTA. Situations like this are an example of why I have a very strict \"Don't loan money to friends or family\" policy. That being said, if they need help and I can, I will. I personally just write off the money and don't expect to see it again. *If* they do happen to pay me back, it's a pleasant surprise. Also, you can't help someone that doesn't want to be helped, and you can't help someone if you can't help yourself. Keep yourself financially stable before trying to stabilize others, or your both likely to capsize.", "NTA but let's be frank, you aren't showing yourself to be much more fiscally responsible so maybe stop loaning money you can't afford to miss.", "Yeah, you're not getting your money back. \n\nThink of this as a \u00a3150 life lesson. \n\nCut him off, block him. That ain't a friend. \n\nNTA", "You created the issue for yourself.", "Nta and the dude that says that 150$ is nothing should give that money to you or just simply shut up.", "NTA \n\nI taught my kids and I go by this rule...\n\nNEVER loan money you expect to get back. \n\nIF you will be left short, you don't have the money. \n\nIF you won't miss the money, feel free to GIVE it to him. \n\nIf you have a hundred and can afford 20, just do the 20. \n\nIt's great to help others, to give someone a leg up when they need it, and I encourage my kids to be generous but not at the cost of their own needs. \n\nYour friend is taking advantage of the fact that you have no boundaries. Set some. He has set boundaries with you. It's not mean, it's self worth, and sets you up to be able to succeed and help more when needed.", "How long are you going to play the sucker?", "NTA but he's not your friend.", "Here is a lesson for you. You can\u2019t help others if you can\u2019t help yourself. I know it feels good to help or maybe you felt bad for your friend. But help yourself first, become successful or at least financially stable, and THEN you can help feed your friends as much as you want. Lending money out when you can\u2019t afford to clothe, feed, or house yourself only hurts you and your future helping abilities.", "NTA, cut your loses and BOTH ' friends'...\nIt Reminds me this scene from a Bronx tale : \n\nCalogero \u2018C\u2019 Anello: \u201cHe owes me 20 dollars.

Should I crack him one, or what?\u201d\n\nSonny: \u201cSometimes hurting somebody ain\u2019t the answer. First of all, is he a good friend of yours?\u201d\n\nCalogero \u2018C\u2019 Anello: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t even like him.\u201d\n\nSonny: \u201cYou don\u2019t even like him. There\u2019s your answer right there. Look at it this way: It costs you 20 dollars to get rid of him\u2026 He\u2019s out of your life for 20 dollars. You got off cheap. Forget him.\u201d", "NTA. This person has obviously taken advantage of you multiple times. Why would you ask to \"borrow\" money that is already owed to you?", "NTA for what you\u2019re asking but you\u2019re definitely TA for spending your money on him and then going broke days later. What are you even doing. Drop the friend and stop lending money when you can barely take care of yourself financially.", "NTAH, your friend is TAH as he took advantage of you, he didn\u2019t help you out through your bad time, friends aren\u2019t just there for the good times but also through the bad times. It\u2019s ok to feel rejected, betrayed, hurt and angry. It\u2019s about morals and respect which clearly your friend doesn\u2019t have. Cut him loose because you don\u2019t need people like that in your life, they are only going to bring you down with them.", "NTA, but surely you must know that?", "NTA.

Do it on every single post.", "NTA, but why\u2019d you help him more than once?", "You shouldn\u2019t be lending money to anyone when you sometimes don\u2019t have enough money for yourself.  You need to close the bank of Lazy Bed Nugget permanently and manage your own finances better.\n\nESH", "NTA. Just gullible. There\u2019s an old saying that goes \u201cfool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me\u201d. I hope you see how it applies. \n\nGood on you for wising up any saying no.\n\nYou can tell your mutual friend to give him the money since they feel so strongly. I\u2019d probably cut off this person too.", "NTA. Why isn't the mutual friend upset he didn't help you? Neither of them are your friend.", "NTA. Replace the word friend with the word leech. Or mooch.", "NTA. I could understand why you would buy him food after the first 100 because you trust him but now he\u2019s just using you for money. The mutal \u201cfriend\u201d who called you a A-hole is almost as guilty as the friend , especially if they know that friend hasn\u2019t paid you back.", "NTA but perhaps stop carrying forward the balances(s) of sunk costs and hurt feelings. You are never going to settle-up financially and never going to settle up for past poor treatment by this person. So consider any future $ to be a donation and any helpful act as a random act of kindness  never to be reciprocated. If you aren\u2019t interested in these terms, keep a safe distance between you and this person.", "NTA, you helped out. But, a good piece of advice going forward, if you ever \"lend\" money to family or friends. Just consider that money gone. If they do suprise you and pop up one day to repay, awesome, but never expect it. If you can't afford to lose the money forever, just say you can't help. If you consider him a friend, and want him around in your life, don't mention it again. Lending money and having an expectation of getting it back, has ruined many, many friendships and family connections for a lot of people. As you get older, friends become fewer and far between. Generally that amount of money isn't worth causing a rift.", "NTA. For him, generosity is a one way street heading only to him.

Don't lend money you ever expect to see again. Your friend is an irresponsible user and will only interact with you if you can give him something. You learned the lesson for $150.
