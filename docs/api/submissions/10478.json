And unfortunately sometimes the odor is\u2026unpleasant. I genuinely don\u2019t mean to be a nuisance, but it\u2019s not something I can help when it winds up being a nuisance.\n\nI used the public restroom at work today and the lady in the stall next to me starts remarking about the unpleasant smell, and of course I\u2019m feeling bad because it\u2019s\u2026not something I can help, but I keep quiet.\n\nShe then keeps continuing to remark about how unpleasant it is, and I eventually just quietly say \u201cI have IBS I\u2019m sorry\u201d.

I don\u2019t want to take up a single stall restroom in case someone else needs it.

You have a medical reason to use whatever bathroom you need, so do not feel bad about taking a single stall for a long time or using a public restroom. That\u2019s why it\u2019s there.

You'll be surprised how much smell can be taken care of by burning a match and letting the smoke dissipate the smell. \n\n2) Probiotic supplements really helped me out before I got diagnosed, and they helped balance my gut bacteria.\n\n3) Apple cider vinegar (1tbsp in a glass of water) on an empty stomach first thing in the morning, preferably on an empty stomach. Does the same thing as a probiotic for gut bacteria. It's important to get one that is unfiltered / unpasteurised, or as they call it 'with the mother'. The most popular one is [Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar](https://www.bragg.com/products/organic-apple-cider-vinegar). \n\n4) Cutting out dairy and gluten can actually help more than you realise. Dairy also creates excess mucus, and that can cause more irritation to the gut, not to mention can cause gas and bloating. Beans, highly-processed / fast foods, and cruciferous vegetables also cause lots of gas, so those irritants being cut out can help a fair bit with the discomfort and smells. \n\n5) Eating oatmeal or getting good fibre (even psyllium husk) supplementation can help regulate the bowel movements and keep them consistent and relatively stable.\n\n6) Plenty of water also helps, keeps the body happy, keeps the stomach happy too.\n\n7) Fish oil (omega 3,6,9) is good for you.

I've had every test done - tubes down there, up here, cameras, scopes, barium enemas, x-rays, you name it - and since nothing was ever found (inflammation), they called it IBS. But some of your family history suggests auto-immune diseases like Crohns & colitis which causes inflammation of your colon. That can raise your risk of colon cancer & other complications. There are medications that can stop the inflammation, plus those are conditions you need to monitor (esp. for any early signs of cancer.)

I used to be in there for an hour or more until I finally found out I was lactose intolerant and I don\u2019t take more than a few minutes now. I know you say you don\u2019t have the time or money and I completely get that but try to make it a priority as soon as you can. There are other things you can try like excluding things from your diet for a week and seeing if things in the bathroom change for you. Either way, I wish you the best of luck. And seriously, screw that lady.", "Absolutely NTA.  It's a frickin' bathroom, not a Sephora!  \n\nEchoing the other comments about Poopourri.

This is how 4 immates sharing a double bunk cell and a single toilet keep the piece. \n\nAnd about this lady running her mouth about it... you gotta stop this right now... go to HR and file a complaint before she does.  Even if she doesn't complaint she will ruin your reputation by gossiping.  Get on front of it and make her look like the AH.

Good luck.", "NTA, and go to the doctor.", "NTA. I also have IBS, and I get the embarrasment that comes with. I don't know about you,  but my body can very suddenly need to go to the bathroom like right the f--- now, and if I don't I'll have severe stashing pains the rest of the day (even if I go to the bathroom later). I some things that helped me though.  First,  lots of probiotics in my diet. Second, low-FODMAP diet. FODMAPs are a group of families of easily fermentable sugars. For some reason my body does not properly digest these,  and so the undigested sugars get much farther into my digestive tract than they should,  and gut bacteria that normally don't have that much sugar go wild.  Think how yeast chomps through sugars in beer and wine for in-bottle carbonation, but in your gut. Anyway, going through a low FODMAP diet is designed to first avoid these easily fermentable sugars, and second identify which sugar families you cannot digest. \nFun fact - some groups are predisposed towards not being able to digest certain sugars.  Kinda like Japanese folks are more likely to be lactose intolerant, Polish people are more likely to have issues digesting fructose.", "Someone who take 3 twenty minute bathroom breaks to play on their phone.", "This.

I don't know much about that,  but I hate fragrances.", "Add a low-FODMAP diet to the list.  If your body cannot digest some or even all of these easily fermentable sugars, then they'll get into your gut causing gut bacteria to go nuts.

Oh man, I did not realize when I was little what bad constipation was like. You get so full it hurts.

It was all I could do to keep my mind off the pain, otherwise I\u2019d be kicking and writhing. At worst I get it for like an hour of really bad every other week or so, but early on when I first had it I sometimes went like 10 days straight of just pure fucking agony.
