You have a medical reason to use whatever bathroom you need, so do not feel bad about taking a single stall for a long time or using a public restroom. That\u2019s why it\u2019s there.

You've had to suffer so much. I really hope you manage to get this sorted, just for your own comfort more than anything else. \n\nA few things you can do in the meantime:\n\n1) Always carry a matchbook with you to the toilet. You'll be surprised how much smell can be taken care of by burning a match and letting the smoke dissipate the smell. \n\n2) Probiotic supplements really helped me out before I got diagnosed, and they helped balance my gut bacteria.\n\n3) Apple cider vinegar (1tbsp in a glass of water) on an empty stomach first thing in the morning, preferably on an empty stomach. Does the same thing as a probiotic for gut bacteria. It's important to get one that is unfiltered / unpasteurised, or as they call it 'with the mother'. The most popular one is [Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar](https://www.bragg.com/products/organic-apple-cider-vinegar). \n\n4) Cutting out dairy and gluten can actually help more than you realise. Dairy also creates excess mucus, and that can cause more irritation to the gut, not to mention can cause gas and bloating. Beans, highly-processed / fast foods, and cruciferous vegetables also cause lots of gas, so those irritants being cut out can help a fair bit with the discomfort and smells. \n\n5) Eating oatmeal or getting good fibre (even psyllium husk) supplementation can help regulate the bowel movements and keep them consistent and relatively stable.\n\n6) Plenty of water also helps, keeps the body happy, keeps the stomach happy too.\n\n7) Fish oil (omega 3,6,9) is good for you.
