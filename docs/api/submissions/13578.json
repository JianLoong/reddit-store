The comments he makes don't sound like what most fathers (or father figures) would say. It sounds off.", "YWNBTA. Nobody should be at your wedding that doesn\u2019t fully support it. But. He\u2019s probably going to want him there. I would ask him to talk with the man beforehand and make it clear that if he, in any way, puts you or this relationship down, the friendship is over and he will be asked to leave.", "Because you said that English is not your first language, I think there may be some cultural differences at play here.\n\nThe thing that your fiance's friend said about 'allowing' you to get married as long as you don't hurt him was probably not meant literally. In English-speaking countries it is very common for people to joke about this kind of thing.\n\nBut saying that you are not pretty enough is definitely a hurtful thing to say and not okay under any circumstances (regardless of cultural/language differences).\n\nOverall I think probably YWBTA by demanding that he is not invited. Clearly he is a good friend of your fiance and it is his wedding as well. However you are entitled to speak up about anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. I presume some of your family members will be there and efforts should be made not to offend them or make them feel uncomfortable. Your fiance is responsible for talking to his friend about this and should be understanding of your concerns.", "YWNBTA\n\nDon\u2019t invite anyone who will not celebrate your marriage.", "YWBTA. You need to have a conversation with your fiance and express your concerns with him about the things that were said. If this guy is like a father to him, he's going to want him there. If the conversation between the two of you is healthy and productive, then it's time to bring \"dad\" in and have a conversation with the three of you about your concerns. If your conversation with fiance doesn't go well, and he doesn't have your back, you may need to reevaluate things a bit. However, to me, the things \"dad\" has said are similar to what many dad/brothers would say to the person their sibling is marrying. (Not the ugly comment, that's too far and should have been addressed immediately by you and your fiance)", "To save the drama don\u2019t prevent him from coming to the wedding. However, ask a friend to keep an eye in him and escort him out if he starts acting up. NTA", "INFO: How does your bf react when this \"friend\" insults you?

Talk to your fiance about your concerns and feelings. Explain to him how his friend\u2019s behavior and comments have hurt you and made you anxious about the wedding. Ask him how he feels about his friend and what he thinks would be the best way to handle him. Try to be respectful and supportive of your fiance\u2019s relationship with his friend, but also assert your boundaries and expectations for your wedding day.", "YWNBTA. This friend has made it very clear that he doesn\u2019t approve of you and has outright insulted your looks. I disagree with the commenters who\u2019ve said you\u2019re \u201cdemanding\u201d that he not be there. Your post says you would be expressing the opinion that you don\u2019t want him there, not demanding that he be uninvited. It\u2019s your freaking wedding, who would want someone there who\u2019s said they\u2019re not happy about your marriage and insulted you?? I definitely think you are well within your rights to express that you would feel uncomfortable with his presence given his past behavior. I\u2019d also like to know how your fianc\u00e9 has reacted? Has he been defending you? If not, I think that\u2019s even more reason to bring this up. You deserve to feel supported and be surrounded by people who are happy for you and your fianc\u00e9 on your wedding day.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA.

Don\u2019t say that you are going with a dry wedding specifically because of him. Just say you want a dry wedding because you want people to remember the occasion and to be present. You could create fun mocktails with your fianc\u00e9 to represent your relationship too\n\nAddress the comments with your fianc\u00e9. Ask if you or him could revise the friend\u2019s speech for the wedding. You don\u2019t want to remember the day as being hurtful. You don\u2019t want this friend to hurt you\n\nThat\u2019s the best idea for a compromise I could fathom.
