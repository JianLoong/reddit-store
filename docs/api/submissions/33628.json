Some family members live close by, other's lives farther. \n\nI have an aunt from my mother's side who passed away at the end of November. She lived an hour and 20 minutes away but I loved her very much. She was my favorite aunt and I was devastated by her death but I am good at concealing my griefs. \n\nMe, my mother, my siblings and other family members all went to the funeral. I told my wife that I was gonna be out of town for 5 days. She asked me why and I told her that I was just visiting some relatives. \n\nBut recently my wife got upset when she found out about the real reason why I went out of town. It was last week when me and my wife went to my parents house for dinner and my mother started to reminisce about my dead aunt and my wife asked if my aunt passed away. My mother was surprised and confused and told her yes she passed away and was sort of shocked that she didn't know. \n\nLater when we went home me and my wife went at it. She told me how wrong I was for hiding something major from her like this but I argued with her saying that it's not a big deal and it's my my grief to deal with. Not hers and it has nothing to do with her and our marriage and it won't affect the marriage in a positive or negative way. She told me that she was upset that she wasn't there to support me and I rolled my eyes and told her I don't need her support at all and I told her to get over it and I even promised her that I will try to suck it up and act normal so you won't have to deal with my pain and suffering but she still felt the need to tell me that I needed to be more vulnerable because she doesn't feel comfortable being vulnerable to me. \n\nMy mother later called me to tell me what I did to my wife was wrong because my mother and other family members tought that my wife was a terrible person and that she did not Give a damn about me. \n\nAm I an asshole for keeping MY grief to myself and not telling my wife about the funeral ?", "created_utc": 1703339148, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18p6059/aita_for_going_to_a_dead_family_members_funeral/", "score": 746, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

Regardless of how much time wife spent (or did not spend) with deceased Aunt, the *family* experienced a loss of a beloved family member and wife, as part of the family, should have been with the family.\n2) Deceased Aunt may have been wife's fave too, for all you know.  She had a right to grieve for the loss.\n3) Wife could have been there to support you in your grief.\n4) She is your wife.  Not your roommate.  She isn't just someone with whom you split the bills and have s*x.  What else are you keeping from her?\n5) you made wife look horrible in front of the whole family by not even telling her!!!  Do you plan on divorcing wife?  Why are you shutting her out??  Why are you even married?? \n\nYou need serious private counseling/therapy to get to the answers to some of these questions and learn how to share your life with a spouse.  This kind of compartmentalizing can be characteristic (and helpful) of folks with ADHD and Asperger's (like me).  That is great when you want to separate the trauma, for example, of ongoing cancer treatment from other aspects of your life, but not on a daily basis in a marriage. \n\nI strongly suggest the two of you get marriage counseling to learn how to communicate.", "YTA. Big time. First off you LIED to her. Secondly, marriage is a partnership where you are supposed to be vulnerable and supportive to each other. Why get married if you aren\u2019t ready to carry the emotional weight of a marriage? How would you feel if your wife disappeared for five days to bury a loved one and she never told you? Wouldn\u2019t you feel insulted at the very least that she thought you weren\u2019t capable of helping her grieve? \n\nWere you not allowed to show emotions growing up? When you got upset were you told not to cry or something?? \n\nIf you value hanging onto your marriage, I\u2019d sit her down and sincerely apologize and tell her you\u2019re starting therapy to work through your hang ups on showing emotions. \nSource: I\u2019m married. If my husband did what you did I\u2019d be considering divorce.", "YTA.   \nA big one.\n\nYou treat your marriage and therefore the relationship with your wife as a transaction that regards only one part of your person. It is terribly disrespectful and a deal breaker. You were gone for five days to a place 1.5 hours away to bury and grieve your beloved aunt and you did not think that your wife is not only entitled to know your whereabouts but also to be able to feel part of the family she has married into. By denying this to her, you only allow her a partial marriage, you keep her away from the relationships she has chosen to be part of by marrying you.\n\nI would not be surprised if she is reconsidering her relationship with you. You have shown her, loud and clear and in no uncertain terms, that she is only allowed access to a part of your life and that you control that part.\n\nYou are a huge asshole for this. You deserve to be dumped and if there will be a post here by a woman whose husband went away for five days to bury a relative less than 200 mils from home without letting her know , i think this sub would encourage her to assert self respect and dump the jerk she married.", "YTA\u2026but it did affect your marriage in a negative way.  Why in the world would you not tell your partner first life that your favorite Aunt passed away?!  That you were going out of town for five days for her funeral?  That she had to hear all this from someone else? Why would you not want the most important person in your life, (or supposed to be), there to support you in your grief and time of need and for you to lean on?  And you tell her you don\u2019t need her support?! Because that is what my husband and I do for each other.  Your wife is now questioning everything about you and your marriage.  Why are you even married to her?  I can\u2019t even give you a pass because of your grief.  Your actions are wrong on so many levels.", "YTA\n\nThis was a dumb thing to keep quiet about. You lied to your wife. You are using your grief as an excuse to be a crappy person. She married into your family just as you married into hers, so your family members are her business. \n\nWas it worth it?", "YTA - The whole \"I don't want support from you. I don't need your support.\" vibe is very concerning.", "YTA. What a bizarre thing to do - to not even mention your aunt passed away to your WIFE??? To leave for 5 days and not even say why or where? \n\nAnd then to make matters worse - you STILL didn\u2019t give her a heads up before seeing your family together??? You knew damn well it was going to be brought up - and she\u2019d look uncaring and not part of the family - totally disrespectful behaviour. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about grieving privately - this is just treating your wife as if she doesn\u2019t matter to you or even belong in your family. \n\nI\u2019d be seriously questioning my relationship with you and wondering what else you were hiding. You are a huge AH.", "YTA. You lied to your wife and made her look bad in front of your family. News flash: when you\u2019re married, you tell each other important things. \n\nYou could have said, \u201cmy aunt died and I\u2019m going to her funeral, but I\u2019m not ready to talk about it with you and I\u2019d like to go the funeral alone.\u201d Instead , you had no problem lying, which means you have no problem lying about other stuff.", "> I argued with  her saying that it's not a big deal\n\nthe death of your beloved aunt is not a big deal?\n\nwhy would you hide a major event like this from your wife? why are you with her if you don't want to share her life with her?\n\nif you don't her support during the funeral, or don't want to be part of your grief, you can just ask her. \n\nbut why actively hide it from her like it's a dirty secret?\n\nYTA", "YTA. Mushroom thrive if kept in filth in the dark. Your wife is no mushroom. Why on earth would you not tell her? You have some very odd ideas about what marriage is supposed to be.", "YTA\n\nYou might not understand the concept of marriage. Why wouldn't you tell your wife that your aunt died? That is inconceivable to me.", "YTA. You chose this woman to **share your life with**, not to treat her like some outsider on an info diet, and you lied to her.\n\nIf I was your spouse, this would lead me to wonder what else you have put on a \u2018need to know\u2019.\n\nAnd then you rolled your eyes at her when she said she wanted to support you? Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t make it to year 4. Your marriage is too new to be accepting of this kind of thinking. If I was her, I\u2019d get out before kids got involved.", "YTA.....why are you lying to your wife...what else do you lie to her about?.... communication is key you could said I just don't want u to come but still told her", "Sorry, but YTA. if you want to deal with things by yourself, you should be by yourself. That is a major thing to keep from your wife. You're allowed to say that you prefer to process things on your own  but you needed to have at least told her wtf??", "...dude what the fuck.  This has to be fake, you cannot possibly be this obtuse.  YTA.", "YTA. A marriage is a partnership. If you don\u2019t want a partner don\u2019t be married. Grieve your own way but always be honest", "YTA. \n\nMaybe your wife would have wanted to go to the funeral with you. \n\nMaybe your family thought that she was the AH for not sending condolences or coming to the funeral. \n\nIf at the next gathering your wife said \u201cOh, where is Aunt. I haven\u2019t heard from her in ages.\u201d And then the family said \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d And thought she was insensitive. \n\nAnd in any case you are being selfish in holding the grief to yourself instead of letting her share it.", "YTA. It's not the grieving thing, it's making your wife look like an idiot by not telling her about an important event in your life.", "Wasn't this story posted a couple weeks ago? Almost identical", "YTA\n\nDude, reading your comments you need psychological help. Real help, not podcasts about masculinity from uneducated con artists.", "YTA. It's one thing to keep your grief to yourself, it's another to hide the facts of what is going on in your life from your wife. How fucking embarrassing must it have felt for her to have asked about this in a situation everyone expected her to know. What did your family think of her not going to the funeral or sending condolences, did they think she didnt care? Did she like your aunt enough that she mightve wanted to attend the funeral for her own sake? \n\nYou can keep the actions of grieving private, but lying to your wife about going to a funeral and not telling her that an important person to you is dead is frankly unhinged behaviour.", "YTA - why hide major life events from your spouse ? I would be upset too.", "I\u2019ve read this before. Are you back again to learn YTA for not informing your wife of a death in the family and needing to protect your precious masculinity?", "YTA. You need therapy to figure out why you are emotionally closed off to your wife. Your marriage won\u2019t last if you don\u2019t get this fixed.", "YTA\n\nDo you even love your wife?", "YTA I\u2019m afraid. I had originally written quite a harsh judgement but I think you need an objective explanation rather than a random person on Reddit having a go at you for your behaviour.\n\nFirst off, you\u2019re married. That means you and your wife are united as one, and you should consider each other part of the same team. You may not want to share your grief with her, but you should definitely tell her about major events in the family she married into.\n\nWhich brings me onto the funeral. By not telling her about your aunt\u2019s death and the funeral, you\u2019ve made a choice for her that affected other\u2019s perception of her in a negative way. She didn\u2019t have the chance to pay her respects even if she wanted to, and you made her look like a fool at dinner in front of her mother in law and relatives. The relationship between a wife and her mother in law can be one of the most challenging to handle, and you put her into a very difficult position.\n\nNow your wife probably thinks she\u2019s not important enough to be told about what\u2019s happening in the family. She likely feels like an outsider, which is not how your wife should ever be made to feel.\n\nNone of this is acceptable behaviour on your part, and everything could\u2019ve been avoided if you\u2019d just told her about your aunt\u2019s death. You said this is your grief to handle. This don\u2019t mean you have to go and cry on your wife\u2019s shoulder or any other act you feel may emasculate you, you\u2019re entitled to handle your grief in any healthy way you see fit, but you absolutely cannot leave your wife out of big family news like that. I\u2019d also say you lied to her by omission since you only told her you were seeing family and left out the real reason why.\n\nYou owe everyone involved a very big and heartfelt apology. I\u2019d also suggest you think carefully about your wife\u2019s role in your life and what it really means to be married. The kind of errors you\u2019ve made here cannot be repeated, or you WILL lose her.", "YTA. I can't imagine having to be married to someone this emotionally dense.", "YTA - Your wife is your equal and entitled to have full disclosure of family issues, including bereavements. Your wife will have been welcome and likely EXPECTED to have also attended her funeral. It is not normal to lie about where you\u2019re going and why for 5 days and return without a word. If I was your wife, I\u2019d be questioning your truthfulness of any and all past and future trips. This is a huge F-Up on your part.", "YTA you should have told your wife about the death. You told her you were visiting relatives, not laying one to rest. I understand that grief is a weird thing but your actions show your wife that you don't see her as a partner. You also allowed your family to think horribly about her and they probably talked shit about her because she wasn't at the funeral. What you did could have had irreversible consequences on the relationship your wife has with your parents and siblings.", "YTA. Even if you felt like you could handle your grief and didn\u2019t need emotional support, why wouldn\u2019t you want the person who\u2019s supposed to be the most important person to you, by your side for ALL major life events!?!?", "Of course YTA. And you have to be really stupid on top of that to even question if YTA.", "YTA.\n\nThis is your WIFE, your partner, your other half. You should have told her.", "Idk whats worse, what you did or the fact that you can\u2019t SEE why this is wrong. How could you not see it even when your wife AND mom told you it was. \n\nWow. Unbelievable.  Your wife deserves better. \n\nYTA", "YTA why don\u2019t you tell your wife things", "YTA, you lied to your wife, hid something from her, and made her look unsupported and cold.", "You didn't even *tell* your wife that your aunt had passed? You *lied* to her about why you left town for five days? And then you threw her, all unknowing, into a dinner party where everyone was going to judge her merely for not attending the funeral with you?\n\n>My mother later called me to tell me what I did to my wife was wrong because my mother and other family members tought that my wife was a terrible person and that she did not Give a damn about me.\n\nYour mom said it all.

YTA\n\nSince this aunt was so important to you, did your wife know her? If so, did it ever occur to you that she might want to pay her respects as well? Also, marriages are supposed to be a partnership. Why would you leave something as big as the death of a beloved family member out of any conversations you have with your wife? \n\nDo you even like your wife?", "YTA - Your desire to grieve privately is not the same as making sure your wife has no knowledge of major life events for you personally and for the family. Your wife married into your family, so she is now also a part of it. If you let her be. I am glad to hear your mother believed your wife and gave you feedback that what you did to her was wrong.\n\nIt is a very strange thing to do, and based on your arguments in your OP you seem like you have some hangups around vulnerability and showing and expressing an ordinary range of emotions. That's not a good thing. Sure, you are free to feel that this is a good thing, but you shouldn't be surprised if it puts an unbearable strain on your relationships that you choose to act this way.\n\nYou should apologise to your wife and family, and you should consider therapy for the challenges you seem to have when it comes to your emotions and your vulnerability.", "I distinctly remember reading the wife's version of this when she found out a few weeks ago...", "YTA\n\nIn order to protect your sensitive masculinity, are you going to hide every funeral happening from your wife? Why is it okay to cry and share sentiments in front your extended female relatives, but not your WIFE?

Some family members live close by, other's lives farther. \n\nI have an aunt from my mother's side who passed away at the end of November. She lived an hour and 20 minutes away but I loved her very much. She was my favorite aunt and I was devastated by her death but I am good at concealing my griefs. \n\nMe, my mother, my siblings and other family members all went to the funeral. I told my wife that I was gonna be out of town for 5 days. She asked me why and I told her that I was just visiting some relatives. \n\nBut recently my wife got upset when she found out about the real reason why I went out of town. It was last week when me and my wife went to my parents house for dinner and my mother started to reminisce about my dead aunt and my wife asked if my aunt passed away. My mother was surprised and confused and told her yes she passed away and was sort of shocked that she didn't know. \n\nLater when we went home me and my wife went at it. She told me how wrong I was for hiding something major from her like this but I argued with her saying that it's not a big deal and it's my my grief to deal with. Not hers and it has nothing to do with her and our marriage and it won't affect the marriage in a positive or negative way. She told me that she was upset that she wasn't there to support me and I rolled my eyes and told her I don't need her support at all and I told her to get over it and I even promised her that I will try to suck it up and act normal so you won't have to deal with my pain and suffering but she still felt the need to tell me that I needed to be more vulnerable because she doesn't feel comfortable being vulnerable to me. \n\nMy mother later called me to tell me what I did to my wife was wrong because my mother and other family members tought that my wife was a terrible person and that she did not Give a damn about me. \n\nAm I an asshole for keeping MY grief to myself and not telling my wife about the funeral ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m sorry if this is your parents fault. But you have the WRONG idea of what a man is.", "Dance right off with that attitude. It\u2019s ridiculous. You married a woman to share your life with her, JFC.", "You actually turned to Reddit for support. You would rather have hundreds of internet strangers \u201csupport\u201d you than a woman. Get some help.", "That's the stupidest definition of \"a grown man\" I've ever heard. I don't even know where it's coming from since your mom doesn't seem to agree. Is your dad also an emotionally stunted idiot like yourself or did this start with you?", "Definitely not. I have a decent paying job, I pay my own bills, cook for myself and my wife, I got my own car and only rely on myself for anything. A child can't do any of those.

That girl should run.", "This whole post is beginning to sound fake. It\u2019s almost too dumb to be real. \u201cIM A GROWN ASS MAN! MEN DONT CRY\u201d. It\u2019s almost comical", "That's ok. I don't need anybody anyways. When all of my older family members die I'll be alone.", "If you're so independent, why did you get married?", "A grown independent man... throwing a childish tantrum because people aren't agreeing with him?\n\nYeah really showing your maturity there buddy. people who care about each other support each other.

Grow up.", "He asked because you behave worth than my 2 years old toddler. He shows better empathy and compassion than you to others. Why are you such a d*** to your wife?

Three AH's in a trenchcoat pretending to be a grownup AH.", "Wrong.  I did all that at 15 yo.  Adulthood includes being in an emotionally mature, thoughtful, intimate relationship.  You are incapable of that.", "Ok like many others here i think your version of masculinity is fucking dumb \n\nBut even with your version of feeling like a man why lie? Could you not have stoically told your wife about your aunts death?\n\n\"Hello wife, my aunt has died and I have to go to the funeral to pay my respects.\" \n\nI don't think it's healthy to not share emotion with spouses, but when i experienced a death in the family i was able to tell my workplace without sharing my grief with them so couldn't you have done that? \n\nAs well as just being deeply emotionally unhealthy, you put your wife in a shit situation where it looked like she didn't care about you or any other member of your family (she might have wanted to send condolences to your mother for example!)", "That is something you should go to therapy for.

Yuck", "Real men have feelings.", "You're the worst sort of man, because you lie, hide things and cannot be trusted to be honest and open.

Unless you don't really consider her family...", "Are you saying you'll be alone because you will no longer be married by then? I ask because you don't seem to think of your marriage as anything more than a requirement of being an adult male, and not at all like a partnership where you share your life with someone.

Please do her a favor and divorce her.", "That's not what marriage is supposed to be. Whatever your reasoning was, you did it for the wrong reasons. If your independence is so important she might as well get her own place.", "This has NOTHING to do with being independent. It\u2019s actually pretty sad life to think that way.

If your independence doesn't allow you to fulfill your obligations to the partnership you joined (your marriage), then you aren't independent.

The very mark of a child is to appear as an adult, or what they think an adult should be.\n\nThere is no one way to be an adult, you simply are an adult because you are.\n\nAdults need support all the time, maturity is knowing how to navigate life's issues by building a support system and gaining emotional maturity.\n\nBy closing yourself off to support, you live in denial and pretend you can handle all of life's issues by yourself. You deny that you need help with grief (which is the first stage of grieving) and pretend that because you believe there's no issue, everyone else needs to deal with it.\n\nIt shows a need of control and the need to control other people's emotions. Instead of having the emotional maturity to deal with your wife in a way that is respectful of her emotions and autonomy and allowing yourselves to navigate this grief together, you decided you weren't going to tell her and she should pretend her emotions don't exist.\n\nWhat a childish way to view the world.", "If you truly feel you would do fine with no one around you should do everyone in your life a favor and get lost. Divorce your wife, leave your friends and just move someplace away from everyone. You sound miserable as fuck to be around.", "By staying with you exactly.
