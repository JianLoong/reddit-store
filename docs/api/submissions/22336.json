That's a no-go in my opinion. \n\nYour own family comes first now. She had her chances years ago and she blew it big time. \n\nYou need to set boundaries with her now. Limit her visits to less than a week and she can stay in a hotel, rent a car and meet you for lunch, the park or somewhere for a few hours. She wants what she threw away years ago. She made your childhoods miserable you said and she made her bed. Now she must lay in it instead of trying to erase it all away.", "YWNBTA to saying no. You don't have the space, you have higher priorities, and most of all: YOU DON'T WANT TO.

Let her enjoy Florida winters by herself.", ">We\u2019ll likely take care of him for life \n\nNTA, but as your child gets older (like 20) seriously consider putting them in a group home. There are good ones out there, you're highly unlikely to outlive them, and \"right after you die\" is a *very bad time* to inflict a total change in living situation on them.", "NTA if you and your sister even feel a little guilt see how much you two would have to chip in on top of her social security to put her in a decent home", "NTA shut her down now.

You have enough on your plate with a small home/apartment and a special needs child.

You don't want her there, that is all there is to it. We won't even get into her abandoning you as a child, etc. You need to put the family you created first, well ahead of your mother.
