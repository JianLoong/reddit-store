Your husband has already ruined the romantic vacation you were looking forward to, so maybe shift focus and try to look forward to this as YOUR trip... \n\nYes, do the 1 day event that you have planned for you both, BUT.... the other two days (including his family visit day).... do whatever YOU want to do. Whatever that may be, examples: Spend all day sunbathing with fruity drinks, grab a taxi to see a museum or a zoo, ask the locals about where to find great food or shopping and treat yourself, whatever your heart desires. If your husband doesn't like that then just tell him that HE changed the context of the vacation and that you only did the same due to HIS inability to tell his father not to come.", "No she sucks because she's making a big deal out of this when the wider context shows there's really no wrong doing here. Husband obviously loves his dad, sees him for a week once a year. Her family they see every week. They're going to see his side of the family on the other side of the US. It makes 100% complete sense to two birds one stone it and have his dad there too. Her and the FIL's neutral/cold attitude to each other is an important detail there. The fact he only sees his dad once a year was a very important detail as well. You don't get to be mad when you see your family every week, and then your husband is hoping to get a few extra days on top of the one week a year he gets to spend with his dad. I fuckin love my dad, I totally get her husbands thing. \n\nI think there was a miscommunication, there needs to be a more clear and concise communication about the meaning of a trip. If I was going on a romantic getaway, I would not go see family. To me that makes it very easy for wires to be crossed. That's me, that's how I view this situation.", "Not petty! Way to think outside of the box- take it as an opportunity for you to do your own thing.", "> No she sucks because she's making a big deal out of this when the wider context shows there's really no wrong doing here. \n\nAh, I believe the term for that would be Y.T.A.", " Youre not an AH for your feelings and I dont want to fall your husband and FIL AHs until they decide what they want to do."]}
