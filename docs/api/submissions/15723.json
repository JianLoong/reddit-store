Whatever that may be, examples: Spend all day sunbathing with fruity drinks, grab a taxi to see a museum or a zoo, ask the locals about where to find great food or shopping and treat yourself, whatever your heart desires.

It makes 100% complete sense to two birds one stone it and have his dad there too. Her and the FIL's neutral/cold attitude to each other is an important detail there. The fact he only sees his dad once a year was a very important detail as well. You don't get to be mad when you see your family every week, and then your husband is hoping to get a few extra days on top of the one week a year he gets to spend with his dad. I fuckin love my dad, I totally get her husbands thing. \n\nI think there was a miscommunication, there needs to be a more clear and concise communication about the meaning of a trip. If I was going on a romantic getaway, I would not go see family. To me that makes it very easy for wires to be crossed. That's me, that's how I view this situation.", "Not petty!

Is this day event something you both NEED to attend?\n\n It is not your job to live for the comfort of others. If he cant see it from your view point dont go. Or let him know you're going to make other plans while there bc you do not want to be a third wheel. And the whole point was for couples time. My partner's family does the same thing. And while it annoys him that I leave to do my own thing there is no point in me being miserable when no one is concerned with my comfort.

Does FIL want to spend all weekend with you guys? I'm just having trouble seeing the lines in the dispute. Like, if your husband just wants some 1-on-1 time with his dad (who he does not see very often based on your other comments), could you ask him to treat you to an hour massage session somewhere while they get drinks to catch up? Can you go a half day earlier to meet for a meal?\n\nMy spouse moved away from their family for me, so even if we did have a couples getaway, if there was a chance he could see his dad, I would want to facilitate that because we don't know how much longer he'll be around, so my spouse being able to have those moments seems important. I actually think your compromise *is* reasonable, so my answer is either n.t.a. or n.a.h. But we don't really understand why your husband does not like the compromise, and his position could be fair as well.", "OP, ask your husband if you can bring a GF to stay in the room with you guys since the trip is no longer going to be a couple's trip and because you don't want to be a third wheel on your own vacation.

Not only should you two attend marriage counseling and figure out appropriate boundaries with his father, but you will no longer be spending the trip with him.
