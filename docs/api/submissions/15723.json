I think you offered a compromise by spending time with him on the day that you are visiting other family and that would leave 2 days for the 2 of you.

I\u2019m asking because it seems very reasonable for your husband to want to see his father, since he only sees him once a year, would like to see him more often and this vacation creates an opportunity for them to meet up.", "NAH. Ok I feel like I can add some perspective given that I have a very similar situation to you.We see my family constantly as we live in the same town as them but my husband's parents, siblings and grandparents all live in different states. He sees his parents at most twice a year and grandparents usually every other year.\n\nYou're not going to like this, but I think you need to accept it this time and set a boundary going forward. I think your FIL and husband are excited to see each other since they rarely do. It's not cool that he just invited himself, but it has already happened. I would have a different opinion if your husband didn't want his dad to come, but he does. You don't want to drive a wedge there. It's his vacation too. You're allowed to be disappointed and expect him to make up that quality time soon, though.\n\nWhat I would do is tell my husband that we will go along with it this time, but he needs to plan another trip or activity for just the two of us soon, and that he needs to have a conversation with his father about inviting himself to things without checking first. Set the boundary so that this doesn't happen again. But I think pushing this is going to hurt your husband and FIL, and it's going to diminish your overall experience anyways.", "NTA.  The 1 day is a good compromise and your husband needs to stick up for you with his dad about the weekend.", "NTA. He needs to run it by you if he wants to alter your vacation plans significantly. You have every right to be upset. What kind of a place are you visiting? Maybe you can plan your own activities.", "NTA and apparently I\u2019m more fond of ultimatums than I thought. I\u2019d honestly draw the line of compromise as the time you\u2019re with the rest of his family. Anything more than that you\u2019re no longer joining him on the trip.", "Definitely NTA. Ask your husband how he\u2019d feel if your mom invited herself on your couple\u2019s vacation? He needs to put himself in your shoes!", "Nta Put your foot down and book yourself a lovely stay somewhere else, where you will be pampered. Tell your dh that you hope he has a lovely honeymoon with his father and that you have bailed out since he\u2019s so keen.  Instead you\u2019ll have your own somewhere else.    Then let him know you\u2019ll take pictures.", "Exactly. That's what I was thinking. Just seemed like \"hey I'm coming\" not a \"may I come\".", "I was looking forward to it.", "That's what I was hoping for.", "That's what I thought.", "Thank you!!!", "Thank you so much! I felt guilty and all.", "Yes. He wants to see his dad.\n\nI think he would like to see his dad more if he could but maybe no more than 2-3 times a year.\n\nWe see my side at least once a week.", "Thank you", "Thank you. I thought I was being fair if we had one day to hang with family.", "Thank you. Fingers crossed.", "True.", "For the most part yes. The reason I say for the most part is because we designated one day to do the family check in with the remainder being us alone time.", "That\u2019s what I was concerned about. I didn\u2019t see this going well even if I doesn\u2019t come. I\u2019m going to chat about it. I don\u2019t want the resentment and to have a bad trip. Which is possible if he wanted him to come.", "Thank you!", "My hope was to plan couple stuff. Kind of a lively location.", "Thank you!!!", "I\u2019m starting to feel like that.", "You need to talk to your husband about it asap, else it\u2019ll be a shitty one for you. It may still be, depending on how he takes it, but as of now it\u2019s nothing of what you looked forward to.", "Unfortunately it sounds like your husband WANTS his dad there. In that case, you know what, I wouldn't go. Because knowing I'd be the third wheel, I just wouldn't have any fun and would feel resentment. Then I'd rather stay home and have a bubble bath with nice food and not constantly hoping maybe my husband will choose me and get disappointed when he doesn't.", "Don't feel guilty. It's extremely rude to just invite yourself on someone else's vacation. I don't get what your FIL was thinking. I'd be really upset.", "Wait. Hold on. This is some important context. \n\nYou see your family at least every week and he only sees them 2-3 per year?! \n\nThats an imbalance.", "Then I genuinly think that you and your husband just have diffrent ideas about what this trip is all about. For him this is also a chance to see his dad he barely gets to see. \n\nI understand why you want to have this vacation for you and your husband and even respect your reasons, but I am going with NAH because neither your husband nor his parent is in the wrong for wanting to meet.", "This is actually a pretty big detail. I now understand why someone would want to join a couple's vacation. Was the original plan a couple-only vacation or was it a couple-goes-together-to-this-place vacation? NTA but could also be NAH", "If it\u2019s going to be awkward even if dad doesn\u2019t go because you objected and the alternative it\u2019s going to turn into a trip where you would be a miserable third wheel why don\u2019t offer a third solution? \n\nOffer to stay home since your husband didn\u2019t consult you before agreeing you would not be the AH for altering the plans even further. You can spend the money for your portion of the trip on yourself and dad can save money by staying in your room with your husband. They can even share the same bed so he can get a pseudo couples experience. \n\nNTA", "I want to. I just nothing is booked. That\u2019s my fear.", "We live close to my side. His family moved out of state.", "I see what you're saying.", "It was a couple-only vacation with agreement to spend some time with family member that lives there.", "That\u2019s not sounding like a bad idea.", "Which happens - okay another question. You mention where youre going, your has husband has family that lives there. \n\nDid the FIL ONLY schedule his own trip because youre going or he\u2019s also visiting family?", "He\u2019s scheduling because we\u2019re going. I think he\u2019s trying to kill two birds with one stone.", "Then I think you need to communicate more with your husband - your husband and FIL shouldnt take over your trip but it sounds like your husband may genuinely want to see each other more.", "I agree. I think the intentions are good but the play out is the issue.", "You also mention \u201cother side of the world\u201d - how far are you talking? \n\nDid you plan a \u2018couples only trip\u2019 to \u2026 where your husbands family is from? \n\nIm starting to think you were a little disingenuous with how you wrote this post.", "Opposite sides of the U.S. Opposing coastal cities. No we\u2019re not going to be in same state just closer state than if we had to travel directly to them. They would have to take plane to where we are. A closer plane ride away."]}
