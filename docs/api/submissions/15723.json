Ok I feel like I can add some perspective given that I have a very similar situation to you.We see my family constantly as we live in the same town as them but my husband's parents, siblings and grandparents all live in different states. He sees his parents at most twice a year and grandparents usually every other year.\n\nYou're not going to like this, but I think you need to accept it this time and set a boundary going forward. I think your FIL and husband are excited to see each other since they rarely do. It's not cool that he just invited himself, but it has already happened. I would have a different opinion if your husband didn't want his dad to come, but he does. You don't want to drive a wedge there. It's his vacation too. You're allowed to be disappointed and expect him to make up that quality time soon, though.\n\nWhat I would do is tell my husband that we will go along with it this time, but he needs to plan another trip or activity for just the two of us soon, and that he needs to have a conversation with his father about inviting himself to things without checking first. Set the boundary so that this doesn't happen again. But I think pushing this is going to hurt your husband and FIL, and it's going to diminish your overall experience anyways.", "NTA.  The 1 day is a good compromise and your husband needs to stick up for you with his dad about the weekend.", "NTA. He needs to run it by you if he wants to alter your vacation plans significantly.

In that case, you know what, I wouldn't go. Because knowing I'd be the third wheel, I just wouldn't have any fun and would feel resentment.

Doesn\u2019t respect basic boundaries for you. \n\n2) Your partner is staunchly refusing a very reasonable compromise. Why? \n\nWhy can\u2019t he plan a trip with his dad at another time?

If so, he should be prioritizing these 3 days to connect with his **Wife**.\n\nI\u2019d ask him: is there a reason he doesn\u2019t want alone time with his wife? \n\nIs there a reason you deserve to lose your vacation in favor of it turning into a father/son trip? \n\nI\u2019d stay home if he pretends he\u2019s incapable of saying \u201cDad, this is actually a romantic trip for the 2 of us. I\u2019m excited to see you when we travel to you later this year, but we won\u2019t have time to share *this* trip with you or get quality time.

His dad passed not long after & he got to have those memories & that time. Yrs later when our daughter flew out to cali even after her friends all canceled, my husband flew me out to join her.
