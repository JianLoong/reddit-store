This has pretty much been the case since they met, but was exacerbated by an incident that occurred the first I (29m) introduced him to her, and also by Jay coming to stay with us for a short period of time. He is neuro-divergent and has sensory issues, and I worked to accommodate him as a guest. He made a simple request before his arrival (no strong scents), which I informed my wife of before his stay. Still, I had to remind her every single day after work to go shower because her strong perfume made him feel sick. Another incident occurred where my wife made dinner and both the smell and texture bothered Jay, so I ordered him take out. My wife accused me of babying him. Jay, who had already steered clear of her to begin with, really made a point to not be around her from this moment on.\n\nThings came to a head between them two months ago. One of the very few times he's stopped by my house since that visit, he ended up accidentally spilled water on my wife's new MacBook. I understood her frustration, but she was (in my opinion) unnecessarily harsh and very adamant about Jay paying for it. Ever the sweetest person alive, he did as she asked and brought over the new laptop and an apology note. \n\nI'd already felt guilty about him no longer feeling welcome in my home, and this situation just made it worse. I stopped by his place soon after with tearful apologies of my own and begged him to let me send him the price of the laptop and then some. He was reluctant, but I told him it was the least I could do and just the beginning of me making things up to him.\n\nThat brings us to tonight. My wife asked to see bank statements from my account. She handles our joint finances so I figured it was something relating to that, so I allowed her. She saw the charge of the money I had sent to Jay and lost it. She said even if I hadn't directly bought the laptop I had still undermined her and was also lying about financial matters. She said I would never go to such lengths for her or any of my other friends and that it was insulting I was prioritizing someone who had 'made her feel uncomfortable in our home.' She demanded an apology and I have yet to give her one. She's sleeping in the guest room tonight. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672805971, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102town/aita_for_lying_to_my_wife_about_who_paid_to/", "score": 515, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And why are you coddling Jay? He broke it, he replaced it\u2026and you wanted to not only reimburse him, but to give him *more* money? Because it was *\u2019the least you could do\u2019*???? Why is that?\n\nWhat\u2019s with the tearful apologies? What were you apologizing for?", "He broke it. He should pay for it. Yta", "INFO: When did you first realize you're in love with your friend? Your post makes it glaringly obvious that you care more about his feelings than your wife's.\n\nYou literally describe him as \"ever the sweetest person alive\" for paying for a laptop he broke, like anyone would be expected to do. He isn't a sweet angel for this, he's a normal human person.\n\n>I stopped by his place soon after with tearful apologies of my own and begged him to let me send him the price of the laptop and then some. He was reluctant, but I told him it was the least I could do and just the beginning of me making things up to him.\n\nThis is SO weird. Your friend, an adult, broke your wife's laptop, and then paid for the damage like any reasonable adult would be expected to do. You then felt compelled to pay him back the cost plus EXTRA (?!), *tearfully* told him this is only the BEGINNING of you making it up to him, and BEGGED him to forgive you...ummmmmm what?!?!\n\nYou sound codependent and ridiculous, like you're speaking about a crush you've idolized and obsessed over, not a normal adult human friendship.", "YTA because you did undermine your wife. And to top it off, you paid with joint money, not yours. \n\nAnd when Jay stayed over, did you actually discuss this with your wife? Or did you tell her? That makes a huge difference. \n\nBecause while I agree that the no strong scent thing is simple, it's still extra work for your wife. It means she changes her daily routine.  And regarding the dinner, was your wife advised which textures and smells to avoid in her cooking? Is there a reason you didn't cook instead? Also, you essentially subsidized Jay's dinner by buying his takeout. Why can't the grown man buy his own dinner?\n\nFinally, you inserted yourself where nobody asked. Jay already got her a new laptop.  \n\nSomething is funny here, where you keep \"making\" things right with Jay.", "YTA how long have you been dating your bf, Jay? You do realize that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, right? While married to your wife you also have a bf, did your wife agree to an open relationship? Between the touching, catering to his needs and now paying for something he broke off your wife\u2019s instead of letting him be an adult and post for his mistakes. If you\u2019re still married in 2024 to your wife I will be shocked!", "YTA, he broke it,  he should pay for it.  Your wife is right in this situation. You are coddling your friend when you should be supporting your wife.", "Yes YTA. You asked your wife on short notice, to change her daily schedule, to change her cooking, all for a guy who by your own admission \u201creally made a point to not be around her\u201d. Great, she had to make all these changes for someone she would literally not be seeing, who was living in her home (how long of a stay is \u201cnot long\u201d btw?)\n\nAlso how is it harsh to make him pay for something he broke? He broke it, he paid for it, then you said no and paid him back. So *you*, and by extension, your wife paid for it (she manages your joint finances). It\u2019s great that you want him to feel comfortable in your home, it\u2019s lame that you don\u2019t feel the same way about your wife.\n\nAlso she\u2019s right with everything she said. Babying him, lying to her about finances, undermining her. *Would* you go to such lengths for anyone else? For your own wife even?\n\nETA: nvm, reading OP\u2019s comments, it\u2019s clear it\u2019s *that* troll again. Y\u2019know.", "YTA.\n\nLook, I get sensory issues, fellow ND- do I think she was being a super host? No. But also you don\u2019t sound particularly tolerant of her having to adapt to someone with specific needs in her space. It takes some getting used to and it doesn\u2019t sound like you consulted her or gave her time to think this over. Neurotypical people also need patience and time to adjust. \n\nAlso, you have really gone above and beyond normal \u00ab\u00a0hosting\u00a0\u00bb with this behavior. It\u2019s weirdly overboard. You went behind your wife\u2019s back to undermine your friend rightfully paying for something he broke, and you seem to think that\u2019s ok because there was some uncomfortable moments while he emergency stayed with you?\n\nI think if you afforded your wife even a quarter of the grace you give your friend, I think she\u2019d be a lot less upset. You very obviously value and respect this friend much more than her- and I suspect that\u2019s more at play here than the ableism you\u2019re implying", "YTA forrrr sure.", "When are you going to tearfully propose to Jay? Can't wait for the update", "YTA. And the way you talk about your friend is somehow both infantalizing and weirdly sexual at the same time. As someone on the spectrum it makes me uncomfy for reasons I can\u2019t quite pinpoint.", "Info: why just Jay? You say it\u2019s all about not making someone feel welcome in your home that\u2019s making you favour him - but what about everyone else you both have over ? Does your wife beef with them too? Or does Jay just overstep boundaries unlike other guests?", "YTA\n\nMuch can be said about your wife and her issues with your friend. I'm betting it's a lot less one sided than you're making it out to be. I would love to hear her side of things. Especially when you made her uncomfortable in her own home to please him.\n\nHowever, you're asking if you're the asshole for lying to your wife, the answer is absolutely yes. Don't lie to your partner. Little lies build up, and nothing ends relationships like feeling that you can't trust your partner. \n\nYou admit that Jay broke the laptop. God only knows why he was around it with a glass of water to begin with. He **did** break it, and it's not unreasonable to demand that he replace it. I don't understand why you're babying what is supposedly a full grown man. Being ND doesn't mean you aren't responsible for your actions. It isn't an excuse.", "YTA. I can sort of understand the catering to Jay when he was a guest, though maybe not to that extent. But paying for the laptop when Jay broke it and is able to pay for it himself is ridiculous and a little sus tbh. Not to mention trying to hide that from your wife.\n\nIf you actually love your wife, you should apologize for lying to her.", "I swear I have read this very post before. The sweetest person alive comment. Not everyone says that about another bloke.", "YTA.\n\nAren\u2019t you the same guy who made your wife stop wearing perfume in her own home and bought super expensive sheets for this friend? And you never actually told her he was ND, so she just presumes he\u2019s being a demanding houseguest?", "YTA. I also want to note how you always refer to your friend by his name and to your wife as \u201cmy wife.\u201d\n\nIn your mind, he exists as a person, she exists as an accessory. You treat them both like that. I hope she gets out.\n\nAlso, regardless of my personal needs, I cannot *imagine* being a guest in someone\u2019s home and insisting that they shower for me and on my schedule. Jay is TA too", "YTA omg what!? You showed up to his place crying and begging for an apology after you accommodated him for a stay at your house, and replaced the item he was responsible for breaking? Makes no sense. I thought you were going to say you paid for it because Jay couldn\u2019t afford to. The fact that you used JOINT FUNDS and LIED ABOUT THAT, only to be confessed when you didn\u2019t get away with it?, is the cherry on the cake.", "INFO\n\nDid you post on here when Jay was staying with you? That part of the story sounds very familiar.", "YTA,  clearly he\u2019s more important to you than your wife. Let her go be happy with someone else who will actually put her first.", "You took away her right you decide who lives with her.\n\nYou took away her right to use perfume for someone you forced her to live with.\n\nYou blew marital money by paying him for replacing a computer he broke.\n\nYTA", "YTA: on a related note, when are you leaving your wife for Jay? It\u2019s crazy how much more you care about him than her based solely off your post. All she wants is an apology and you can\u2019t do that but can drive, cry, and pay back plus for Jay\u2026I\u2019m just saying the maths is wrong here.", "Awwwww you and Jay sound like such a sweet couple. \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nEdit: I'm really sorry how repetitive this post got. Imma 100% blame it on the 'tism\n\nAs someone who is ND (autistic, ADHD, Bipolar, and a whole other list of shit wrong with my brain that makes me act like a fucking alien), my issues are not an excuse for anything. If I break someone's computer, I should buy another one. It's the right thing to do, and standard human behavior. Does it suck that I have to buy a computer I broke? Sure, but that's what you do. That's just how shit works. If I hit your car with mine, I pay for the damage. If I break your shit, I buy a new one or pay for the fix. The fact you think you somehow owe this friend *anything* for his breaking of your wife's laptop is.... Really really strange.... Like, I know my idea of how stuff works is a bit fucked because I'm autistic as fuck, but even I know the social rules for if I fuck someone's property up. If anything, I'd say if I broke my friends wife's laptop, I'd buy them a new one on top of giving them cookies or something as a \"sorry for breaking your thing\" gift. It doesn't go the other way around, that's fucking weird. \n\nI expect my friends to accommodate me to a point, as anyone would try to make their friends comfortable. My needs are a bit unique since I'm ND, but this shit you're doing for your friend goes well beyond that, and goes into some really fucking weird territory. If my friends treated me like you treat this friend, my SO would think I'm fucking them or something, which would be a totally valid concern if I'm going to their house crying because *they* broke *my* wife's laptop. \n\nYou seem to bend over backwards to make your friend happy, to a fucking weird extent.  I'm not being hyperbolic for effect, the way you talk about this person in your post and comments makes it sound like you don't just love your friend, as anyone would love a friend... It sounds like you're *in love with them* and it's fucking weird. \n\nYou seem *way* more concerned about your friends feelings than your wife's. Perhaps she doesn't like this friend because your behavior towards them is the behavior towards a highschool crush. Why the hell do you think you owe this person money?  Because their visit was a little shitty?  Did you pay your wife for her inconvenience too?\n\nIt's ok to go the extra mile to help friends, and to accommodate ND people, but if my friends treated me like you treat this friend, I'd think they wanted to fuck me or something because that behavior is *waaaaaaaayyyyyyy* the fuck out of line for a friend to be acting. \n\nYou're either in love with your friend, or you are delusional about how you should be treating people, you're waaaay to nice to your friend, and your wife sounds like an afterthought. \n\nMaybe see a therapist or something. This isn't me trying to insult you, I genuinely think it would help you establish proper relational boundaries and behavior because this is not normal human relationship behavior, and not normal human friend behavior.\n\nEdit: to add, the whole \"lying to the wife about money\" thing is its own separate issue imo. Sure it happened within the context of this story, but if I spent several thousand dollars and didn't tell my SO, she'd straight up leave me and it would be 100% justified because that is an *extremely* fucked up thing to do, especially if you share finances. You had no right to keep that from her, and she has every right to be pissed at you for lying to her about spending over a thousand dollars without mentioning it, and worse, you tried to hide it. Your wife should be the one person that knows *everything* about you, your actions, thoughts, etc.  If you think you need to hide shit from her, then you need to reevaluate your relationship on the grounds of her not deserving your dishonesty, and you not being able to trust her enough to tell her what you did.", "i\u2019m neurodivergent and i can tell you that Jay IS NOT the sweetest person ever. \n\nINFO: is he under drs care?

This has pretty much been the case since they met, but was exacerbated by an incident that occurred the first I (29m) introduced him to her, and by Jay coming to stay with us for a short period of time. He is neuro-divergent and has sensory issues, and I worked to accommodate him as a guest. He made a simple request before his arrival (no strong scents), which I informed my wife of before his stay. Still, I had to remind her every single day after work to go shower because her strong perfume made him feel sick. Another incident occurred where my wife made dinner and both the smell and texture bothered Jay, so I ordered him take out. My wife accused me of babying him. Jay, who had already steered clear of her to begin with, really made a point to not be around her from this moment on.\n\nThings came to a head between them two months ago. One of the very few times he's stopped by my house since that visit, he ended up accidentally spilled water on my wife's new MacBook. I understood her frustration, but she was (in my opinion) unnecessarily harsh and very adamant about Jay paying for it. Ever the sweetest person alive, he did as she asked and brought over the new laptop and an apology note. \n\nI'd already felt guilty about him no longer feeling welcome in my home, and this situation just made it worse. I stopped by his place soon after with tearful apologies of my own and begged him to let me send him the price of the laptop and then some. He was reluctant, but I told him it was the least I could do and just the beginning of me making things up to him.\n\nThat brings us to tonight. My wife asked to see bank statements from my account. She handles our joint finances so I figured it was something relating to that, so I allowed her. She saw the charge of the money I had sent to Jay and lost it. She said even if I hadn't directly bought the laptop I had still undermined her and was also lying about financial matters. She said I would never go to such lengths for her or any of my other friends and that it was insulting I was prioritizing someone who had 'made her feel uncomfortable in our home.' She demanded an apology and I have yet to give her one. She's sleeping in the guest room tonight. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Him eating takeout that\u2019s acceptable also isn\u2019t a big deal (maybe he should have ordered it instead of you, but a friend buying a meal isn\u2019t really that big of a deal and I can see why he might feel awkward in the circumstance). It is also weird to me that she demanded to see statements of your personal account - it sounds a tad controlling or like she was looking for an indiscretion. \n\nJay doesn\u2019t suck because from the sound of it, he makes reasonable requests, is willing to pay for what is his fault, and mostly tries to avoid being a burden.
