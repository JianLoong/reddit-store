My mom was also there to help.  What I offered to do was mostly the daily chores and cooking meals. My BIL (34M) has lots of \u201crules\u201d when you are at his house and watches you like a hawk waiting for you to do something wrong and point it out in some pedantic way.  As an example, he always wants the fan on when you are using the stove, which is reasonable and I oblige without fuss, but one time I woke up and went to make some eggs, I put the pan on the stove without turning on the gas, then went to the fridge to get some eggs, then he comes from behind me and turns on the fan.  Another time there were some chopped raw sweet potatoes in a ziploc bag in the fridge and he opened the fridge and saw that the bag had fallen onto a plate he had his tofu press on so the bag got a little wet, he took out the bag and pointed out to me that I put the bag in a place that allowed it to get wet (It wasn\u2019t it me it was my mom, but I wasn\u2019t throwing her under the bus).  So imagine that these little things are going on multiple times a day all week in various forms. This is not a new experience with him so I mostly just ignore it, even though it is annoying it is mostly harmless.  When I fly home, the next morning I get a text from BIL that reads the following\n\n\u201cCube stealer I see\u201d\n\nMaybe I\u2019m old so I didn\u2019t really know what a cube is referring to. So I reply immediately \u201cI have no idea what you are talking about\u201d. I\u2019m waiting for 10 mins for a response and hear nothing so I start to move on when I get another text from my Mom (who is still at BIL\u2019s house) saying \u201cDid you take BIL\u2019s phone charger?\u201d.  I had already unpacked all my stuff and washed all my clothes so I knew for a fact I had nothing from their house, and that is when I lost my composure.  I told him he was a prick for accusing me, and that just because my sister puts up with him speaking that way to her doesn\u2019t mean he can talk to me that way.  He replied in a shocked way and claimed \u201cit was a joke\u201d.  He also asked what I meant by my sister tolerating him speaking a certain way and I gave him examples of his behavior and how it is perceived. His response was mostly that he thinks he is being helpful and if that makes him an overbearing prick in my eyes then so be it. \n\nThis obviously upset my sister and I\u2019m officially uninvited from their house.  I apologized to my sister for any issue I caused and told her I love her no matter what, but that I don\u2019t feel like I should be spoken to that way. She reiterated that he was joking and that they sometimes say this with friends when someone is missing a charger. I replied by saying how would I know about an inside joke they have with their friends, and that it certainly seemed like he went to inspect the room I stayed in when I left and was looking for something to criticize. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1699978447, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17v5nna/aita_for_snapping_at_bil_for_accusing_me_of/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I fly home, the next morning I get a text from BIL that reads the following\n\nYou have been carrying around a constantly-building aggrievement about his rules and bottling up each new tidbit of anger. A soon to be ex does that to me. Just absolute explosions over nothing, and after an hour of her screaming abuse at me she moves on to the thing she was actually mad about: something having absolutely nothing to do with what was going on when the explosions happen.\n\nThat's YTA\n\nSomeone irritates you that much, you talk to them like an adult about the thing that actually bothered you. Bottling up and exploding about some other thing is not allright.\n\n\\-", "\nYTA - it was a playful comment \n\nthough I understand that you were frustrated with him from the visit and the undertones from your interactions while you were there colored your judgment and that\u2019s why you overreacted.  \n\nI do think you should apologize and clear the air so you can get along for the sake of your sister and family", "NTA \n\nHow is the man who gets upset about a ziploc bag getting a little wet coping with a new baby and all it\u2019s bodily functions ?", "NTA. He sounds like an AH to me.", "Could your brother in law maybe be a little autistic? He sounds like my buddies brother. It very annoying but he doesn't mean it it's just how he interacts. Btw nta", "Hopping on here to add and send this in a group chat...\"Hey sis, when you finally decide to leave this prick, my door will be open for you to come stay.\"  But I'm also that petty.", "I agree it's fair to ask if you have by mistake taken a charger, not to call someone a thief", "Yeah, I took vacation and paid for airfare so you could insult me and be creepy and accuse me of theft - then get all surprised when I finally get angry from the death by a thousand cuts.", "I agree with you about the bottling it up and waiting thing, but how would you go about doing that in the moment?  It\u2019s not like any one thing is so annoying that if a random person did it once to me I would feel compelled to do something. It is the general overbearing nature of it that causes it to be the problem.  I can\u2019t say something like, you annoyed me once, you have 5 more times I will tolerate before we have to have a discussion.  Also, he has been confronted about this in the past by my father when he was alive. Which is why I mentioned that this is not some new behavior we just discovered.  We seem to be at some impasse that we cant get past unless we agree to just not be in each others company for too long and only in neutral territory.", "I'm sorry but if I get a text that says \"cube stealer, I see,\" which is then followed up by another text saying \"Did you take the phone charger,\" that's not playful. And it's only playful if you know the context in which it's being stated. Knowing how the brother in law acts and talks to him, nothing would imply that he was being playful.", "I agree too. And I did say to him that if he asked me to look for something I may have accidentally packed I would have happily double checked.", "the follow up text was from op\u2019s mom. which is worse, imo. this man not only accused op of stealing with no explanation, he tattled on him to his mom. insufferable behaviour. nta."]}
