If it was me it would make me add another comment about it because I would find it insulting and dishonest.", "Oh HELL no. NTA.

The point of a review is to give an honest review of the experience you had. Not for the owners to manipulate the reviews to shed positive light on their subpar business.

If yes they should do normal business which they did and it was not great so I don\u2019t get why you feel ashamed for a bad review.", "NTA if anything you should edit the review to state the owner tried to make you take it down.

I think the offer of a refund dependent on removing the review is bullshit. If that happened to me I would have refused the refund and updated my review adding that bit to it. If the owner was truly sorry about the poor quality of their product, the refund would have been offered without any quid pro quo\u2019s.

Now you know how all those 5 star reviews came to be. Also I'm calling out your husband. Several cakes right after gym? Really dude?", "Yes, YTA and it has nothing to do with it being a small business. You never raised the issue on the spot with the owners to see how they handle it/give them a chance to explain, and you by your own admission recognized that \"maybe it was an off day\". Instead they had to track you down and offer a resolution themselves. The very least you could do was to EDIT your review and include that context if you felt uncomfortable with taking it down, and the fact that the owners were willing to help resolve it alone should earn a 4 star review.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They had several hundred 5 star reviews and we were excited. I order a sandwich and he ordered several cakes. Our immediate thought was that everything was very expensive, but what isn\u2019t nowadays. We got everything to takeaway and when I got home I noticed my sandwich hadn\u2019t been cut, and when I opened it the \u201cluxury Turkey sandwich\u201d was just a slice of Turkey ham and a leaf of lettuce. It\u2019s was literally comical that we were laughing about it, but it wasn\u2019t worth \u00a36.50. The cakes were also not that good and cost a similar price.\n\nI went into their Facebook and left a review explaining what happened with the sandwich. I didn\u2019t mention that the cakes weren\u2019t very good or it was very expensive, just that the sandwich was rubbish. I also ended it by saying \u201cBut maybe it was an off day\u201d, because I\u2019m British and not great at making a fuss.\n\nThe owner found me on Facebook, messaged me offering a refund, but to get it I would have to take the review down. That made me feel uncomfortable as I didn\u2019t ask for any money back, I simply wanted to share my experience. She says that because she works so hard it isn\u2019t fair and blamed it on new staff (even though I saw her husband standing outside smoking). My husband agrees with me but I can\u2019t help feeling bad because she is a small business, hence why we wanted to support them. So if a business offers a refund is that enough to have the review removed?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
