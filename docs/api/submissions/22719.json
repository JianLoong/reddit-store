So incredibly devastated.. but y'know in hindsight I'm really glad that talk happened because everyone else had pandered to a very idealistic version and I think I needed a kick up the ass. I ended up enrolling myself in some free parenting courses offered locally and started seeing a counselor and completely turned myself around in a massive way.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with calling things out how they are.

Has he looked into childcare costs in your area? Given that his gf wants to move in with your family she\u2019s not financially independent either.

It could be true but you don't know that yet, and those are inside thoughts. He did ask for your opinion and you could have just said, \"I'm not the biggest fan and think it will be harder than you imagine.\" Asking for an opinion isn't asking for EVERY negative thing someone has ever thought. And your brother is probably stressed out, though I am sure you are too.", "Nta. He asked for your opinion. If you had lied then he would be resentful over the lie later, when he regrets his (dumb) decision to become a father at 19. Could you have said it nicer? Maybe, I wasn\u2019t there.

Your brother isnt mature enough for it, he cant handle simple feedback when he asks for it, how is he going to be able to take care of the kid? You did the only right thing here, maybe some words were a bit over the top, I dont know, but you did good here, even though the recipient is too blind to see it. He is having a kid, immaturity is no longer a valid excuse.\n\nTell your siblings to grow a pair, and understand the gravity of the situation.

Over time her brother will have a kid and all the responsibilities that come with it, him feeling good about himself throughout this ordeal is not an option. You dont have to be a therapist to discuss life events with people you are close with. People are more resilient then this, and stepping on eggshells in this situation is doing them a disservice. \n\nIn the short-term you are right, he wont share anything with her. If he ever grows up, he will see that in fact she is one of those rare people who is actually honest and straight forward with him, turning her into perhaps the only person he can go to for honest, sound advice. There is a chance this will help him reconsider, and if he doesnt, then having someone like OP in his life will help him greatly in the time to come."]}
