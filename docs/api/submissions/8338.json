If you're dating someone, it should go without saying that you like and respect them. If you're not capable of giving a shit about the feelings of others, you are not mature enough to be in a relationship.

We are all extremely close with one another.\n\nOne of the things you need to know about us is that we are all bonded by a shared sense of humor. We are huge fans of doing pranks on one another, and we have our own games and inside jokes. The best way to describe us is we\u2019re like the friend group in the movie Tag(2018).\n\nNow, recently one of my buddies let\u2019s call him Jackson(28M) got into a car accident. He\u2019s partly recovered but he\u2019s still taking some rest and he\u2019s been kind of down in the dumps.\n\nHis birthday was coming up so we wanted to cheer him up cause we hate seeing our friend like that. So we got the idea of pranking my girlfriend, because she\u2019s really posh and prissy, so her reaction would be great and the prank we had in mind would knock his socks off.\n\nAs kids, we used to play this game called pizza roulette, we\u2019d order a large pizza, put each slice on 8 different plates, either face up or face down randomly, and then each of us would be blindfolded and have to take one of the slices and flip the plate over on another one and then hold it up like a sad which to eye level. If both of the bread sides were facing outwards, then congrats you got a calzone, enjoy! If the bottom was sauce down but the top was bread up then it was kind of funny because they picked up the wet side. But if the sauce side was up, then the guy sitting next to you smashes the whole thing in your face! We used to have tons of fun and Jackson loved the game.\n\nSo, Jackson\u2019s birthday comes, we blindfold my girlfriend and rig it so that she gets the \u201cpizza face\u201d and we do it successfully, but she gets really mad and leaves. Now, the guys are annoyed because she ruined the vibe of Jackson\u2019s party but some of the girlfriends in the group say what we did was wrong. I thought it was funny at first but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
