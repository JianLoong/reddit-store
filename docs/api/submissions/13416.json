He used to help his grandfather with his woodworking and learned how to make hand made wooden items and use them as gifts.\n\n\nI planned a dinner party for my wife's birthday at a prestigous restaurant. The day before the party, she was cleaning my son's room and saw what he got her for her birthday and that was a wooden tree with mine, hers, and his name on it. She talked with him and told him while she thought it was a sweet gift, she asked that he don't bring it to the restaurant and give it to her there. Why? No idea. When my son told me this I just had to call her out on it. She flatout said that she thought the gift looked ridiculous and she didn't want it to be seen in that prestigous restaurant, and infront of her guests. I lost it on her and told her she should be ashamed of herself for saying this when my son was being sincere and thoughtful. She swore she wasn't \"ashamed\" nor \"embarrassed\" by his work and even said she'll take the gift but she \"simply\" didn't want it to be seen there. I told her not to worry about it since I decided to cancel the whole thing. She went off on me calling me unreasonable for outright cancelling her birthday over such trivial thing. I refused to keep arguing but she threw a fit about how I ruined her birthday and made her lose respect for me and my promises.\n\nMy son kept the gift since she left thd house 2 days ago, and her mom has been chewing me out for my decision and calling me an asshole for treating her daughter like this.\n\n\nIt could be that it was not a big deal and I overreacted, but my son was feeling hurt by her request.", "created_utc": 1680031715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124zfq2/aita_for_cancelling_the_birthday_party_i_planned/", "score": 245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not seeing this MIL anytime soon", "We don\u2019t know how old she is?", "Is she though? She sounds like she\u2019s 19-20. This isn\u2019t a grown woman we are discussing here and if it is, then wow!", "Agreed, OPs wife was downright cruel.", "Agree", "100%", "That is an incredible point. I didn\u2019t make that connection when I read it, but OP should point that out to her.", "I know when he first described it, I immediately thought how sweet and thoughtful of op\u2019s son\u2026.op needs to find someone nice\u2026not this awful stepmom", "She has a rock where her heart should be.", "Right? A lot of stepmoms would be thrilled their stepchild thought so highly of them, especially after only two years, and here she sits telling him it's too ugly for the fancy restaurant.", "This. She doesn't want to be his mother. In any way. She has probably resented him all along. Please see the red flag.", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s hate but it sounds like she finds him embarrassing and wish he wasn\u2019t there", "That and the fact that the 15 year old boy who lost his mother before step mom came into the picture only 2 years ago feels strongly enough about her to put all their names on a tree, making it a family tree, saying he sees her as family. She should be crying tears of joy and parading that tree around town shouting from the roof tops how much it means to her. Instead she just ruined his trust, affections for her and possibly any other woman his dad has a relationship with. \n\nOp NTA and you never will be for putting your son first.", "That's what I was thinking. I think most people joining a family with a 13 year old who had lost his mom would worry they'd never be accepted, that he'd resent them. Here he is spending hours making something sweet and thoughtful to make her feel loved and she acts like this?", "Ther what stuck the most to me as well..we see so many posts here about kids not accepting step parents. Here\u2019s a kid doing his best to accept her and essentially spits in his face.  Hopefully she\u2019s soon the ex.", "It's even more significant than being heartfelt. He was basically saying that he accepts her as part of their family and wants to grow together. She slapped him in the face with that ridiculous request rather than seeing it for what it was.", "Yeah, it\u2019s a bit hard to see the true intent behind her opinion. Is it because the wood work is big, because then she\u2019s not really an AH. Is it because it\u2019s not the best since he\u2019s still working on his skills, then she\u2019s an AH because that\u2019s pretty petty. Is it because she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with her step-son to be publicly shared in a \u201cI\u2019m not your mom, we\u2019re only family by law,\u201d then she an AH for marrying a guy with kid. \n\n\nBecause she couldn\u2019t give any reason besides that it looks ridiculous and she doesn\u2019t want to be seen with it, I\u2019m kinda going towards that she is, in fact, embarrassed by his still growing woodworking skill (since she said she did say she thought it was sweet). Poor kid", "100%!!! He brought this monster in his very vulnerable son\u2019s safe space.", "Exactly. Notice she spoke to son about gift not husband. She got caught this time!", "He was the one throwing the birthday dinner, though. He planned it unilaterally, he gets to cancel it unilaterally too. \n\nI think some people are losing the perspective that the dinner was OP's birthday gift to his wife. Why would he still want to do that for her, after she treated his son horribly? \n\nShe's not a child. But she's not entitled to gifts when she's horrible to people, either.", "Lol what is wrong with you. She was acting like a child. Brats don't get nice dinners.", "Yeah\u2026no.", "I had to scroll way too far for this comment.", "Who throws a party for someone who made their son feel like shit? It\u2019s not like her birthday was canceled. Im sure she could\u2019ve planned her own party.", "Eh, if she wants to behave like a child, she can be punished like a child.\n\nEdit: I thought that I intended this in jest, but I can see how this sets up an abuser dynamic and isn\u2019t as funny as I thought it was. As someone who was in an abusive relationship myself, and currently in a struggle to regain personal power for myself, I can see how my erroneous swing to the other side of the power dynamics is not a good thing to propagate. Not deleting, but recounting and affirming that jokes are harmful.", "My first impulse reading it would be to cancel the fancy restaurant and take her out to a fern bar/less upscale restaurant instead. Bonus points if you can find one with wood working decor or one of those ones with random ass signs everywhere.\n\nI'm not sure if canceling entirely makes OP the ah or not. If there was any kind of celebration not at that restaurant I would be firmly on n-t-a, but as it stands I'm not sure.", "So actions shouldn't have consequences?", "People who treat my kids like shit don\u2019t get gifts from me. I guess I\u2019m manipulative", "Clarification:  how large is this gift? Does it look like the artwork of an elementary student? \n\nThe problem is that it sounds like the planned party is mixing personal life and professional life. This can make people particularly image-comscious. A fancy setting also comes with certain expectations for image. \n\nYou went from zero to sixty in seconds. This is not a useful thing in working on relationship issues.", "Exactly!", "Feels like OP has left that off to garner sympathy. Especially as he has taken away her treat as a punishment like any short-tempered parent would, meaning he sees her as a child.", "Seriously. He seemingly left her age out on purpose. He knew to put his sons and his\u2026. \n\nSounds like she\u2019s a very young, very naive, very socially influenced trophy wife and now he\u2019s shocked she\u2019s acting like that.", "She sounds like the step mother from parent trap, almost caricature-ly cruel. I thought it was a TV stereotype, I guess it\u2019s not :(", "I think the rock where her finger should be is the bigger issue.", "Don't insult rocks like that!", "This is a bit of a reach. Where does OP say she was expected to replace his son's mother? I mean, how easily could your mother be replaced? There is no indication she resented OP's son all along.", "100% this. As a fellow step mom, getting something handmade from step son is actually more meaningful than when my bio kids do it.", "I couldn't agree more. She's a self-centered and mean person.", "Not arguing the point but,.\n\nShes not a child.. shes an adult. Logically.. to sane people, arguments are talked through and understanding reached.\n\nBut, hey.. maybe thats just me.", "Hard disagree. Punishing adults like children is fucking weird.", "Not every action requires a consequence. Just letting her know that what shes saying was wrong and mean would\u2019ve been enough. He could\u2019ve just told his son that she didn\u2019t want the gift to get lost there. Instead of this drama. Now the son knows that stepmom didn\u2019t like the gift. Probably ruined her relationship with him. I\u2019m not saying shes blameless but all pf this could\u2019ve been handled with more tact", "??? Unsure how you came to that conclusion. Their point is that this was an overreaction. Wrong consequences.", " He's still a child. He's still vulnerable. He still has feelings. He's still grieving but he's trying and she does that.", "Fair enough. I sense this may not be the first time she has acted this way, hence the drastic measure.", "She\u2019s acting like a heartless jerk, so no party \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. They can still talk about why she reacted that way but I personally would never throw a party celebrating someone who acted like that.", "I don't think it's about punishing. OP planned the party himself. He and his wife didn't organize it together; it was him throwing a somewhat fancy party for her. \n\nHe has a right to no longer want to have this gesture toward her after she treated his son like dirt for the most ridiculous and shallow reasons. \n\nShe crushed a teen's feelings when he tried to show appreciation toward her, on her birthday. A child who has lost his mother at what seems to be a young age, no less. \n\nWhy on earth would she still be entitled to have said teen's FATHER still throw a fancy dinner in her honor?!", "And borderline abusive.", ">Just letting her know that what shes saying was wrong and mean would\u2019ve been enough.\n\nOnly if that's followed by a sincere apology to OP's son and reading the post didn't give me the impression that would have happened. \n\nMaybe I'm just harsh but if you hurt a kid emotionally like that, I say fuck your stupid birthday party. It's no longer about you at that point.", "I personally don't think it was an overreaction, mainly due to the fact that any emotional damage to OP's son had already been done, but reasonable minds can disagree. Bigger point is no alternative was suggested. In other words, no consequences.", "Your right. She should follow it with a sincere apology but instead of reacting OP should tell her how this has hurt him and his son. Now shes the one acting all hurt and being the victim. So many marriages end because people just don\u2019t know how to be tactful", "Reasonable minds can absolutely disagree! I appreciate the interaction, have a nice day!", "I agree in principle but each case is unique. In this case, she had already told the son not to bring the gift to the party, didn't explain why, then gave OP the most bullshit reason ever when he asked. It's easy to sit here like Captain Hindsight and say what he should have done - another thing I agree with in principle - but it's unfair to expect everyone to rise to every occasion in every moment. OP's wife certainly didn't."]}
