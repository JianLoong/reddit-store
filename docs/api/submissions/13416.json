He used to help his grandfather with his woodworking and learned how to make hand made wooden items and use them as gifts.\n\n\nI planned a dinner party for my wife's birthday at a prestigous restaurant. The day before the party, she was cleaning my son's room and saw what he got her for her birthday and that was a wooden tree with mine, hers, and his name on it. She talked with him and told him while she thought it was a sweet gift, she asked that he don't bring it to the restaurant and give it to her there. Why? No idea. When my son told me this I just had to call her out on it. She flatout said that she thought the gift looked ridiculous and she didn't want it to be seen in that prestigous restaurant, and infront of her guests. I lost it on her and told her she should be ashamed of herself for saying this when my son was being sincere and thoughtful. She swore she wasn't \"ashamed\" nor \"embarrassed\" by his work and even said she'll take the gift but she \"simply\" didn't want it to be seen there. I told her not to worry about it since I decided to cancel the whole thing. She went off on me calling me unreasonable for outright cancelling her birthday over such trivial thing. I refused to keep arguing but she threw a fit about how I ruined her birthday and made her lose respect for me and my promises.\n\nMy son kept the gift since she left thd house 2 days ago, and her mom has been chewing me out for my decision and calling me an asshole for treating her daughter like this.\n\n\nIt could be that it was not a big deal and I overreacted, but my son was feeling hurt by her request.", "created_utc": 1680031715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124zfq2/aita_for_cancelling_the_birthday_party_i_planned/", "score": 10202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Take her to a truck stop for dinner.", "OP said the restaurant was prestigious. I bet there's a long waiting period for another reservation, and/or it's expensive and wife is a housewife or earns less.", "I'm not sure how true this story is but there was photos so I assume it was.\n\nBut one year for Father Day I made my dad a paper tie. He was in the Marines. INSPECTION DAY was the next day and he fucking wore it to the inspection. Apparently the officer asked about it and let it slide because like fuck it, thats cute?\n\nSo even a MILITARY OFFICER ON INSPECTION DAY let the handmade tie of a SUBORDINATE pass inspection because kids ammiright.\n\nThis lady is worse than a Marine.", "This!!!! I saw something recently about how the only thing you should be saying when someone is cruel/mean/unkind to your child and defends said behavior, is \u201cGet the fuck away from both of us\u201d because if they are openly and without shame doing *and* defending those things in your presence, they are damn well doing a lot worse when you aren\u2019t around.", "They really don't.  Most know they can get whatever they need and want. A thoughtful gift that is handmade and celebrated a person's role as a (step)parent would mean more than a gift worth next to nothing monetarily (in relative comparison to their wealth).", "Yeah, a phone call to the restaurant would fix the reservation in 2 seconds, even in a busy city if you caught it fast enough. If she has unequal access to finances, then my point stands\u2014he doesn\u2019t see her as an equal.", "*frames the paper, keeps it on my desk at all times*", "Unpopular but ESH. It's weird that you get to decide what you guys do for her birthday, like she is a kid. Something is fishy. You actually punished her for what she did. And she actually left. Good for her to be honest. What she did sucks, but she seems to be in a weird situation at your house. Why isn't she organising dinner at the restaurant herself if she wants it so much? Is there something you are not telling us?", "ESH (except the child) - I'm sorry, but I have to point out that although your wife is an asshole for making that decision, your escalation was over the top. Chewing her head off and sabotaging her birthday because of it was the wrong move. A stern discussion and making her see your reasoning could have resulted in a better situation for everyone. \n\nThe way I read it, it seemed like she never had the intentions to disappoint your child, even though she shouldn't have done it to begin with. But now she has left the house, your child now knows that the gift he made could have potentially broken up a marriage. Imagine the feelings he may be having.", "As a parent, how many gifts have our children given us that we tear up over? The wobbly bowl made in second grade, the hand-print ornament in kindergarten, etc? I CHERISH those gifts!! Even handmade cards!! \n\nThis woman needs a serious attitude adjustment. How shallow to only be concerned about her friends\u2019 perceptions of such a thoughtful gift? She might be young and stupid but she\u2019s old enough to know better. Apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree if MIL is pissed, but it\u2019s possible she didn\u2019t get the whole story. \n\nOP, NTA. I think your wife is showing her true colors. Protect your sweet boy. He\u2019s a good one.", "That\u2019s exactly what I thought. I would be beyond honored. Poor kid would come home to me sobbing and hugging him. A teenage boy who lost his biological mom hand made her this gift with their names and her reaction was THAT? Ugh. She\u2019s awful.", "Yep, my 4 year old made me a necklace out of craft beads. First thing he's ever really made. Does it look like silly? Yes. Do I wear it everywhere? Hell yes I do. I can't believe OP's wife would treat her stepson with anything less than unfiltered gratitude. Most parents would kill for a teenager who loved them enough to spend time making them a gift. Let alone one who lost their mom and is actually accepting a new mother-figure into their life. I dunno how many threads I've seen in this subreddit that are dealing with step children / adopted children completely rejecting their parent's new partners.", "Yeah, agreed. Even in his telling of the story it sounds like he overreacted. Instead of just having a conversation about it between them he flew off the handle and cancelled their event. That's a pretty extreme reaction to one possible misunderstanding. He even says he doesn't know why she didn't want to have the gift at the restaurant initially and only confronted her about it later. (Confronting, rather than asking in a considerate way to actually find out.) \nSounds like he got a bit sensitive about a perceived slight and tried to have a go at her a couple of times before she eventually \"threw a fit\" about his overreaction. I kind of feel like he might be the AH.", "Asshats gonna asshat, no matter the age\u2026", "I KNOW RIGHT this part kills me.

Her first husband died while their kids were children and she'd vowed not to remarry until her children were grown. Our friends met while her kids were in high school but they didn't really date until children were grown.  It was so much better for the kids to not have somebody come into the household and play Dad.", "Agree. People like them are so image conscious, I\u2019m sure if it was a $$$ from LV or Tiffany\u2019s they\u2019d be passing it around & bragging", "Man that ain\u2019t no excuse. When I was 19, I was living with a 58 year old who had a 14 year old son, and I wasn\u2019t around too long because life took me in another direction but I loved his dad and I loved his son too and for a while I was there making him breakfast in the morning and picking him up from school, doing fun stuff with him and his dad like a family. He gave me a Mother\u2019s Day card and he said I know you don\u2019t have any kids but you deserve this and I think you\u2019re gonna be a great mom\u2026 oh lord, I did cry, and I still have that card, and to this day he occasionally checks in with me to see how I\u2019m doing, chat with me about how he\u2019s doing. \n\nTLDR you don\u2019t have to be 45 to know how to not be a god damn ASSHOLE to a child trying to show you affection and love. This girl is just straight wrong.", "Ding ding ding", "in no way would this make sense when OP is only 36", "It is very possible. I saw a women in her 30s at least throw a full on temper tantrum in the mall when I was visiting family in CA. It was like a car wreck you could seem to look away. I felt bad for her boyfriend or husband who just stood there looking at her like wtf.", "I understand, but if hubby didn't show up, what would you say to friends and family? A bold lie, certainly.", "Old money wears worn & faded clothes, goes to the local pub & then to the 40 boat \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "A kid I babysat for got me a birthday card that said \"Happy birthday auntie\" when she was 8. When I said I love it but we're not related, she said something along the lines of \"mum said when someone isn't family but you love them like they are, you call them auntie\" \n\nI still tear up when I look at that card and yes I still have it 7 years later, alongside the playdoh snail she made for me. There's no better gift than a child saying we're family and I love you. OP's wife clearly has a cold hard stone where here heart should be."]}
