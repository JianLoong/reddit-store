{"id": 3637, "submission_id": "z982x4", "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay for half the rent?", "selftext": "This post is triggered by the recent HOA rebate one reminding me of a constant argument that my husband (40m) and I (35f) have. He is military and gets a base pay plus extras for various things, such as housing and COLA (though COLA was recently taken away due to decrease in costs here). In the States, the military pays the rent directly. We\u2019re overseas currently, so the pay is given to him, then he pays the housing agency. \n\nCurrently, I make more money than him. I also work for the military as a contractor. However, I only worked the first year of our marriage and then didn\u2019t work for two years due to various circumstances (frequent moving, baby, trouble finding employment after moving overseas). During those two years, he took over all of my bills: car payments/insurance, student loans, etc. If I ever needed money, he would hand it to me without question. I say this because it\u2019s important to note that he\u2019s not stingy with his money and never made me feel guilty for not working due to circumstances beyond my control. \n\nRight now, we split bills. He\u2019s pays some, I pay others. We don\u2019t have any joint accounts because we don\u2019t have the same spending habits and we\u2019re both of the opinion that as long as the bills are covered, we don\u2019t care what each other does with their money (within reason - we\u2019re both fairly responsible). \n\nHowever, it\u2019s a constant conversation that he pays more in bills because I refuse to contribute to rent. I don\u2019t contribute because the military covers the cost. As I saw on the comments on the other post, as far as I\u2019m concerned, that bill doesn\u2019t exist because it\u2019s covered by the military. If we lived on base or in the States, he wouldn\u2019t ever see that money because they would pay it directly. But because we live off-base overseas, they provide the money to him and he goes and pays it. Because the money comes to him, he sees it as part of his paycheck. I disagree and cheekily said that we\u2019ll just live on base next time (neither of us want to do this) because then the bill nor the money coming to him would exist and it would solve this problem. \n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to pay half the rent that the military covers, but he sees as part of his paycheck?\n\nEDIT: I was recommended to add this as an edit to the post. I pay all of the childcare for our two children ($1200/month) and all of the groceries for all four of us ($500/month) without his contribution.", "created_utc": 1669853296, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z982x4/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_half_the_rent/", "score": 586, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So after paying rent, you have $3000 per month to spend on everything else. Now suppose your employer starts paying your rent, and lowers your net salary down to $36k. Are you being paid less? Yes. Are you any worse off? No. In both cases, your compensation puts you in the same place, with $3k per month to spend after rent is paid. But if you quit that job, you'll have to go back to paying $2k per month on rent, because the housing isn't free, it's simply a question of how many steps there are in the process of paying for it.\n\nHere's some more ways of thinking about it.  If I give you $2k, and tell you to go pay my rent, who paid for my rent, you or me?  Me.  Now, let's say I loan you $2k dollars.  You now owe me $2k, and it's time to pay me back, rather than hand the money to me, I tell you to pay my rent.  Who paid my rent? Me.

If OP's husband contributes only x/2 towards rent, then his employer should be reimbursing him just that.\n\nI'm not from the US, but my job focuses around government funded projects and that's the main principle of spending that type of money -- it should be spent only towards the purposes it was granted for.

It's a different amount and different rules based on where they live. If they live on base, the military pays it directly and you don't even see the money. It is not part of his salary. So if they live on base, should they guess at the rent and she pays half of it to him? He gets a higher amount because of his dependents, so technically that extra money is hers, right? \n\nThere are other benefits.
