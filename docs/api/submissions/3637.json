{"id": 3637, "submission_id": "z982x4", "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay for half the rent?", "selftext": "This post is triggered by the recent HOA rebate one reminding me of a constant argument that my husband (40m) and I (35f) have. He is military and gets a base pay plus extras for various things, such as housing and COLA (though COLA was recently taken away due to decrease in costs here). In the States, the military pays the rent directly. We\u2019re overseas currently, so the pay is given to him, then he pays the housing agency. \n\nCurrently, I make more money than him. I also work for the military as a contractor. However, I only worked the first year of our marriage and then didn\u2019t work for two years due to various circumstances (frequent moving, baby, trouble finding employment after moving overseas). During those two years, he took over all of my bills: car payments/insurance, student loans, etc. If I ever needed money, he would hand it to me without question. I say this because it\u2019s important to note that he\u2019s not stingy with his money and never made me feel guilty for not working due to circumstances beyond my control. \n\nRight now, we split bills. He\u2019s pays some, I pay others. We don\u2019t have any joint accounts because we don\u2019t have the same spending habits and we\u2019re both of the opinion that as long as the bills are covered, we don\u2019t care what each other does with their money (within reason - we\u2019re both fairly responsible). \n\nHowever, it\u2019s a constant conversation that he pays more in bills because I refuse to contribute to rent. I don\u2019t contribute because the military covers the cost. As I saw on the comments on the other post, as far as I\u2019m concerned, that bill doesn\u2019t exist because it\u2019s covered by the military. If we lived on base or in the States, he wouldn\u2019t ever see that money because they would pay it directly. But because we live off-base overseas, they provide the money to him and he goes and pays it. Because the money comes to him, he sees it as part of his paycheck. I disagree and cheekily said that we\u2019ll just live on base next time (neither of us want to do this) because then the bill nor the money coming to him would exist and it would solve this problem. \n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to pay half the rent that the military covers, but he sees as part of his paycheck?\n\nEDIT: I was recommended to add this as an edit to the post. I pay all of the childcare for our two children ($1200/month) and all of the groceries for all four of us ($500/month) without his contribution.", "created_utc": 1669853296, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z982x4/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_half_the_rent/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
