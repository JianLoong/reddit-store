We divorced and have kept split custody of our daughter Kate. Our divorce was accompanied by a strained relationship with my ex's family, as I discovered they had known about the affair long before I did and kept it from me. Needless to say, trust was shattered, and we only communicate with matters involving Kate. Recently, my ex-husband and his wife passed away in a car accident. As a result, I got full custody of Kate, but I made the conscious decision not to take in Ava.\n\nI am fully aware that Ava is not responsible for her parents' affair, and I acknowledge that she has already suffered a great loss with the passing of both her parents. However, I have actively avoided interacting with Avain the past during pick-up and drop-off times, and we are not close. My ex's family is now calling me the AH (asshole) for separating two sisters, particularly after such a traumatic event. They point out that Leah has no other family members who can take care of Ava, and they believe it is my responsibility to step up.\n\nWhile I understand their perspective, I don't think that Ava is my problem. I don't feel a connection to her, and I am not obligated to take on the responsibility of raising her. The resentment I feel towards my ex-husband and his family has clouded my judgment and made it difficult for me to empathize with them.\n\nEDIT: I would like to clarify, if I don't take in Ava, she will go to to live with my ex's family who live about 4 hours away from where we live. I understand for Ava this move to a new city will not help her as she is going through a lot right now, but I don't think having her with me is the best for either of us, as I am basically a stranger to her, and at least she has a relationship with my ex's family already.", "created_utc": 1685641320, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xo3j3/aita_for_refusing_to_adopt_my_daughters_halfsister/", "score": 4481, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are making it seem like the most important factor is that Ava stay together with her sister, which of course is not true.

Clearly, you don't fit any of the above criteria.  This is nothing but a ploy (intentional or subconscious) to get you to take responsibility for Ava so that they don't have to.

BUT I can see the other argument here. Ava is making a huge adjustment. Ages of children are not mentioned but I know how much of a shock it was when my SIL passed for my niece and nephew. So much so with how that side the extended family pushed their grief onto the children that it wasn\u2019t healthy and there was a step parent / bio father relationship they were dealing with too.   \n\n\nA suggestion I would like to make. Consider meeting with a counselor and talking this through for the relationship issue 4 years ago and the immediate situation. There might be a transitional thing you can compromise on to help the girls for their grief because even though you are not Ava\u2019s family, Kate is. Kate just lost a parent and step parent and needs time to grief too. This is something you really need to bring in a professional in to play and help so your daughter\u2019s health and well being is taken care of too.", "NTA.  And I applaud the fact that you know the damage you would probably cause due to your resentment.  She will be much better off in a loving relatives home, with regular visits between the siblings.

I think it would be unhealthy for Ava if you took her in and were unable to show her love due to how she was conceived. \nThat being said, if you can find a way to get passed the pain her conception has caused you, I think it would be good for your daughter to have her sister. \nYour daughter is probably in a lot of pain from losing her father, having a sister to lean on a grow up with could be very beneficial for her and Ava. \n\nSorry for your loss.", "This was already posted\u2026 exact same story, maybe a few changed details", "Are you unwilling to support visits between the two?

That's not good for a kid and it's strange no one but you sees that. \n\nHowever I do think you need to be sure going forward that you put energy into making sure the sisters do get quality time together. The sins of the adults are not their fault and it would make the whole family assholes if these girls never see each other again.", "Odd ball put here, but I definitely believe keeping siblings together should be the priority and keeping then a constant relationship- if u have no intentions of keeping up her routine contact with her sister? Then YTA cuz ur splitting apart 2 sisters that HAVE  an established relationship and you care less about ur kids relationship with her own sister than ur person hurt feelings. \n\nDown vote me all u want, but my husband's ex wife was willing to adopt his baby from the woman after her, she always said that's her kids sibling, their blood. Anything ti keep them together.", "NTA AS LONG AS you make the effort to make sure that Kate and Ava maintain their relationship.

It's tough that your ex's family kept the affair from you, but that doesn't mean you can just ignore Ava's needs and push her away.\n\nAva is your daughter Kate's half-sister, and they share a connection. They're family. And now Ava doesn't have anyone else to turn to. It's important to step up and provide stability and support for her during this difficult time. She's just a kid, and she needs someone to care for her.\n\nI get that you might not feel a connection to Ava and that you're harboring some resentment towards your ex-husband and his family.

We divorced and have kept split custody of our daughter Kate. Our divorce was accompanied by a strained relationship with my ex's family, as I discovered they had known about the affair long before I did and kept it from me. Needless to say, trust was shattered, and we only communicate with matters involving Kate. Recently, my ex-husband and his wife passed away in a car accident. As a result, I got full custody of Kate, but I made the conscious decision not to take in Ava.\r  \n\r  \nI am fully aware that Ava is not responsible for her parents' affair, and I acknowledge that she has already suffered a great loss with the passing of both her parents. However, I have actively avoided interacting with Avain the past during pick-up and drop-off times, and we are not close. My ex's family is now calling me the AH (asshole) for separating two sisters, particularly after such a traumatic event. They point out that Leah has no other family members who can take care of Ava, and they believe it is my responsibility to step up.\r  \n\r  \nWhile I understand their perspective, I don't think that Ava is my problem. I don't feel a connection to her, and I am not obligated to take on the responsibility of raising her. The resentment I feel towards my ex-husband and his family has clouded my judgment and made it difficult for me to empathize with them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They will only play mind games with your child to try to force you to take in the affair child.  As a single parent you will struggle to raise one child with both time and money.

I think if anything, the relationship with the in-laws is the cancer.", "Has nothing to do with \"strong.\"", "Describing Ava as a cancer is probably a simile is have avoided. However the OP decides to progress this, the child is an innocent in the middle of this.", "I don\u2019t know how you can compare a fully-formed, walking, talking, laughing, crying child to a cancer. She may not be legally responsible for her, but Ava *is* her daughter\u2019s sister. How do you tell your only daughter that her only sister is a burden and not welcome in your home?", "I mean, that's exactly how lots of women feel about unwanted pregnancy, and they are forced to keep the children anyway. \n\nIt sucks but you figure it out. Get therapy I guess?", "That\u2019s why I said it\u2019s up to her. I mean her daughter and Ava have a relationship. She can\u2019t as a good parent cut off her daughter from her half sibling without significant reason other than her own feelings as the primary reason. Assuming Kate and Ava are decently close. \n\nSo this may be a way she can keep Ava at a distance but still honor her daughters relationship. \n\nAlso there\u2019s a massive difference between being involved in a kids life and making sure abuse and neglect isn\u2019t taking place.", "OP shouldn\u2019t adopt Ava, but ignoring her existence means that Ava loses her sister as well as her parents, and that would be extremely cruel.  (And her own daughter Kate loses her sister too.)  Anybody who hates a child that much because of what her dead parents did needs serious help asap.", "My son doesn't hold the fact his half brother is 8 day younger, and very obvious a byproduct of cheating the minute people learn their ages. I don't hold anything against the kid either. Unfortunately they aren't close but that's just because they live states away from each other. Not the kids fault his parents are scallywags.", "I think it depends on how the father or father\u2019s family feels about the relationship with the other woman and the child.  \n\nIt sounds like her ex husband\u2019s family condoned the affair, and that the ex was still with the affair partner after the divorce.   Whenever the father had custody of OP\u2019s daughter, it was at the home he lived at with the other woman and their child.", "Depending. If it\u2019s in the US and it sounds like the ex married Leah (Ava\u2019s mom) then it probably would be at least likely a decent relationship given Ava and Kate would be living together at least half the time. I mean if they\u2019re not close that\u2019s another issue. But in this case I think it\u2019s safe to assume unless Kate was truly old enough to know what was going on (like she was middle school or older) it\u2019s possible she was just told mommy and daddy are not going to be married anymore and the specifics behind Ava\u2019s birth where kept on the down low. \n\nBut this would be relevant information. And if the answer is that their not close then I don\u2019t see the issue severing ties a bit more between the extended family and Op. if they are close then it\u2019s OP\u2019s job not to ruin the relationship between Kate and Ava.", "I am from the U.S. and am close with all of my siblings, some share only a father or a mother and some are step-siblings.  We don't label as half or step-siblings we consider each other siblings. \n\nWe are all close and love and support each other. \n\n We all acknowledge some of our parents are selfish assholes and them being who they are is not our fault.   We all feel like having many siblings to help us deal with our parent's selfishness along with many other growing pains, was and is a type of blessing.", "I mean, they (depending on state) could be planning on going for extended family's rights to get the best of both sides: not having to raise Ava while also getting to make OP the villain and \"cause\" of their distance for not bending over backwards to bring the girls to see them.", "You think it's in the best interests of the kid to pressure a woman who does not know her and actively resents her to take her in just so she can stay with her half-sister she only lived with part-time prior to her parents' deaths? I think it would be irresponsible and not compassionate of a guardian ad litem to pressure this woman in that way. Some people's assumption here seems to be since this person is a woman and has the barest of connections to this girl she should be responsible for raising her.", "And not to mention the resentment to her father and her extended family who where in on it and as such hurt Op too. \n\nLet\u2019s say Op felt up to taking Ava, thats potentially a lot of hurt coming her way.

I'm sure the daughter will be cool with that decision when she grows up.", "It's not their kid why do they need to step up?", "I don\u2019t think the issue is the new city so much as the being 4 hours away from her only sibling, who is the only remaining member of her immediate family. Being 4 hours away means very infrequent visits and possibly a complete severance of the relationship, depending on how motivated each child\u2019s caregivers are to foster it.", "Well, I sure see my kids\u2019 siblings and parents as related to me. I can\u2019t imagine parenting another way. If the people my kids love are stable, my kids are stable. If they aren\u2019t, my kids aren\u2019t.

It would take a very emotionally strong person to be a mother figure to someone who\u2019s living proof that their spouse cheated on them. Being that selfless with your love, time and money would take a very strong individual. I have immense respect for those who have this kind of reserves for an innocent child.", "That's easy.

My main point is that she just lost her father and stepmother, she shouldn't have to lose her sister completely because OP is (understandably and justifiably) unwilling to adopt a child she resents. OP is the parent and can work on overcoming her resentment enough to facilitate them spending time together if that's what the girls want.", "And then her daughter will be traumatized because of the split. She\u2019s gonna suffer for the next 16 years. But if she can put some of that on herself and take some of it off her kid, that\u2019s what parents do.", "[deleted]", "This was my guess. I also guessed that the grandparents probably live close to OP whereas the ex's family is four hours away, so this is their way of keeping her close enough to visit regularly while not having to do any of the work.", "yup, I'm thinking they're trying to make their problems her problems too. She has every right to live her life how she wants without the former inlaws trying to manipulate and control her life like they did by keeping the affair a secret. they took a part in stealing her choices by keeping their lips sealed. Now she is able to choose for herself and she chooses a good life with her child. nothing wrong with that.", "I do believe the argument about the girls no longer being raised as sisters is valid.  However, it can't be expected of OP.  These people are nervy, especially since they allowed her to be the last person to know about the affair and are painting her as the bad guy.\n\nThe only person OP owes an explanation to is her daughter.  If things go south for Ava, Kate is likely to eventually ask her why she let it happen.  \"It's all on your Dad\" might not be enough for her.  Even sooner, she's probably going to ask why she can't see Ava as often.  Ava is the living proof of her husband's affair, but she's also Kate's sister, who she probably loves.  OP needs to have an answer for her, and might need outside help to craft the right words.\n\nThe whole situation is unfair to all of them, and it's not black and white.", "I agree. Wanting OP to take on Ava just shows lack of regard both for OP but Ava and Kate as well. Seems they would rather protect their own interests then do what\u2019s best for those kids. And frankly OP isn\u2019t the best choice for Ava, she likely wouldn\u2019t even make the short list given the circumstances.", "Yes, but they're saying that *part* of OP's responsibility to her daughter is helping to facilitate her keeping in touch with her sister (if that's what Kate wants).\n\nAs the adult/the only custodial parent in Kate's life she is the one with the power to either help the relationship with her sister continue or kill it (the in-laws of course will have the same power, but on Ava's end).", "My point is OP has a responsibility to her kid to make sure her kid has a relationship with her sister. If Kate wants it. If Kate doesn\u2019t want a relationship with her sister then OP doesn\u2019t need to interact with Ava at all. \n\nBut if Op knows her daughter wants to be connected to her sister and gets in the way of that because of her feelings then she would be dishonoring her role as a parent to her child. \n\nIt\u2019s all contingent on the dynamic between Kate and Ava if OP needs to make an effort to keep them connected to eachother even if they are no longer living together.", "My father walked out on us to marry someone else, who had children.  Those children were no relation to me.  I was also older than them (they were in middle school, I was in college) and wasn't at all interested in who they were or what they were doing.  As they got older we became acquaintances, and then the older one decided to go live who knows where and the younger one married some psycho (not really an exaggeration), and I'm happy not to deal with them.", "I mean if Kate and Ava have a close relationship then Op alienating her daughter from her sister would be not ok. \n\nIf Kate isn\u2019t close to Ava then it\u2019s not an issue Op needs to worry about.", "The girls are minors, it absolutely *is* OP's responsibility to facilitate and maintain that sibling connection as the sole parent/guardian left for one of them. It would be irresponsible, cruel, and honestly bad parenting to prevent her child from continuing an ongoing relationship with her sibling. The children are not old enough to do that for themselves. She's under no obligation to and isn't an asshole to not take in Ava, but cutting them off from each other would put her *firmly* in asshole territory.", "No no, I meant that that could be the **paternal** family's plan. Convince OP to take Ava, sue for visitation rights to the girls (since that's a thing that family of a deceased person can do in some states), and then blame OP for them (the paternal family) not seeing the girls more, since they live four hours away and it would take a lot of effort on both sides to coordinate the visits and they can just conveniently drop the ball like deadbeat parents.", "I've actually been a GAL and I have to agree that it would be extremely unprofessional and unethical to pressure OP into adopting Ava.", "That don't make them responsible for his a fair or his kid. I think they're fucked up for pushing the kid on op but they have no more obligation than op.", "Maybe not her responsibility, but she\u2019s going to have to deal with the ramifications of her choice. Neither choice is easy, but one of them would likely leave her daughter with much, much, much less trauma. \n\nI think folks are ignoring how cataclysmic it will feel to be separated from her sibling. It\u2019s gonna leave a serious mark.", "She can also visit with the sister when she visits the fathers family.\n\nIt may not be idea but telling a woman who\u2019s husband cheated on her that she is a bad person for not raising the affair baby is wrong. Op is entitled to her feelings. She is dealing with the hurt that her ex and baby momma caused.", "If that\u2019s what *Kate* wants. Ava deserves an advocate but that will have to be a member of her family (the actual AHs in this scenario). OP\u2019s job is to advocate for Kate\u2019s needs and preferences. If the dad didn\u2019t do a good job of fostering the sibling relationship in his household\u2026that duty died with him.", "Why? Just because OP is an adult doesn\u2019t mean she has to suffer. It wouldn\u2019t be good for Ava to live with a stranger she doesn\u2019t know.

But me personally I have been through enough and suffered enough from childhood up until adulthood and I refuse to suffer anymore if it isn\u2019t any of my concern. It\u2019s not bc Ava will be sent to foster care or will never see her sister again. It would be different if OP had a bond with her, but she hasn\u2019t and it would also be very traumatic for Ava to stay at a strangers home wondering why no one from her family wanted to help her", "Ever heard of sins of the father?\n\nNo one is blaming her for being born. And no one hates her. Ava is a product of OP\u2019s partner betraying her. You cannot deny that fact. It can be the same mixed sentiments of mothers dealing with their babies that are products of SA. Stop forcing people to deal with their trauma when they\u2019re not ready to deal with it. Are we gonna gloss over the fact that Ava doesn\u2019t even have a relationship with OP? She made it clear that she would AVOID her during drop off\u2019s-pick ups. OP isn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be obligated to talk to Ava.

Hopefully OP will find some ways to facilitate the kids continuing to bond as sisters as (zoom/facetime calls, regular online movie or game nights, planning trips so the sister can spend time together). And I agree OP should to go to therapy to help her work through her feelings but also to help her, as a parent, navigate this so she can support her daughter.  \n\n\nI really hope for the best for these two little girls.", "Yes, 1000% that, their interest is the only legitimate interest as far as they are concerned.", "Spot on.", "Not being responsible for facilitating that relationship isn't the same thing as \"cutting them off from each other\". OP's ex husband was responsible for facilitating that relationship when he was alive and OP had no objections of him facilitating that relationship and now that responsibility would be on OP's ex's family, who would be Ava's new legal guardians.\n\nIs your expectation for OP to take Ava in for a weekend or school holidays to hang out with her sister? That would be a bit absurd to ask or expect that of OP.  However i'd agree, OP would be an asshole if she purposely prevents them from interacting but it's not on OP to take the lead responsibility to own that facilitation. The person/s that has a direct tie to both girls should be the one facilitating it and that would be OP's Ex's family since they are the common denominator between the girls", "Wrong. You\u2019re not even talking about the same thing, not being responsible for facilitating is not preventing them from seeing each other.", "Oh! Maybe. Or I think more likely and the cheaper option there would be that the fathers family wants nothing to do with either kid and by pressuring OP to take Ava they absolve themselves and then they can go around lamenting to their friends and neighbors about how OP cut them out and is keeping the girls from them. All in all it means they get the brownie points and they also don\u2019t have to put in effort or time to the girls.", "I just don't know what y'all want me to do with this information. I'm not a GAL.", "They do though because they are blood related to the child and OP isn\u2019t, and hiding an affair from your child\u2019s partner makes you responsible in part.", "You do realize that CPS would most likely favor OP ex\u2019s family over OP because Ava has a relationship with ex\u2019s family and she doesn\u2019t know OP, right? You know they interview the child and ask who they feel safe and happy with, right? Their main objective is reunification with biological family. OP isn\u2019t close to being related to Ava and Ava wouldn\u2019t want to move in with a stranger just to stay connected to her half sister that she only visits so frequently. They can stay connected other ways without having to move into a stranger\u2019s home\u2026\n\nAnd honestly, the way ex\u2019s family don\u2019t want to take her in DESPITE having a relationship with her says more about them than it does about OP.

I said she is NTA.  But she should 100% consider it from her daughter's perspective as well as her own.", "The problem is there is no other parent of Kate to facilitate that relationship now. So OP will have to coordinate meet ups, calls, invites and yes potentially sleep overs (which depending on the circumstances could be held not at her home and instead at the extended family\u2019s place) \n\nBut it is on OP to carve out that time and set up the interactions. It doesn\u2019t have to be in her home or on her own time. But she does have to do this now. Because not doing it (not facilitating it for Kate who lives with her alone) means whoever is facilitating Ava\u2019s interactions needs to go through OP logistically.\n\nSo OP will likely have to see Ava more than she has in the past. So OP is responsible for making sure if Kate wants that relationship that she is able to maintain it. But she is not responsible for becoming her guardian.", "I didn\u2019t mean you basically. I was just making the comment for the ones saying she is the asshole for not taking the child in. That she was being selfish. I don\u2019t think she is being selfish for not taking in the child."]}
