She needs a new career.", "NTA. She just brought you sodas, a $5 tip feels more than reasonable for that. It was a to-go order, she wasn't like she was waiting on a table you were at for a whole meal. I don't know where she works but usually the servers don't even deal in the to-go orders, they have to-go sales people for that so she most likely didn't assemble the order either. I feel like it would have been fine if you didn't even tip her at all in this situation, but you did and that was really nice of you.", "NTA- if you didn\u2019t even dine there, $5 for some sodas if the only thing the waitress actually \u201cassisted\u201d with. It\u2019s the equivalent of waiting for your To go order at McDonald\u2019s.", "I'm no connoisseur of tipping, but I think NTA.\n\nI think the main argument by OP is valid that it seems to me this is MUCH more a carryout situation than a sit-down restaurant situation.\n\nI'm a firm believer that in the messed up tipping culture us Americans live in that you 1) tip ~15-20% for the food service based on quality (sit down and delivery) and 2) no tip for carryout. I didn't create tipping culture, but this is how I personally cope with it.\n\nThis whole situation to me paints a picture of customers going into a restaurant and picking up carryout. The fact that OP must have been in a seating situation to get drink refills and get their food to the table for takeout does not sound like your typical sit-down restaurant situation to me. I'm no server but why would a server thinks this scenario warranted a full service tip? The vouchers here are irrelevant. Honestly I think a 7% tip isn't crazy for this odd situation, let alone throwing the money back at a customer because you felt insulted. That entitlement made me say NTA instead of NAH. Maybe I'm looking at this in a narrow focus, idk.", "NTA: Why tip on a to go order that you picked up?", "NTA. How much would you have tipped at McDonalds? They do the same.", "NTA - it was a Togo order. You basically tipped the $5 for the soda service.", "NTA - I thought you were going to say that you had table service. You had take out, so any tip on that is a bonus.", "Pay the workers a fair wage! More people tip the more these businesses get away with underpaying their staff.\n\nNTA.", "NTA airport food is ridiculously overpriced. A $5 tip would be good for $25 worth of food, which is probably what you would have paid for the exact same thing OUTSIDE of the airport.", "NTA - it was a to-go order!", "NTA, people who depend on tips to live are some of the most entitled, salty people on the planet. They didn\u2019t even wait on you so they were lucky for the five dollars they got.", "Nta\n\nThere's little to no service that required a tip, its a to go order.", "NTA: The server had a major attitude and I would have retracted my tip after that. You could have tipped a little more, but you were going off your vouchers.", "NTA - you were just using a voucher given to you by the airline. You're not obligated to tip beyond what is actually owed; especially on a to-go order.  I don't even think I would have even tipped on an order like that to begin with.", "NAH, the only asshole here is whoever allowed your country to underpay staff and mandate tips.\n\nYou shouldn't be obligated to donate to pay someones' salary, that should be paid by their employer and factored into the prices.\n\nSimilarly the employee is absolutely entitled to be pissed off that they're not getting paid.", "NTA. As a big proponent of tipping in the US, no one in their right mind should be expecting a large tip, if a tip at all, on a to go order. She\u2019s entitled and that entitlement ruins the case for tipping for all other service workers.", "Even if it was a to-go order, if it's mainly a dine-in restaurant most likely they withhold taxes on the original amount and she may have to tip out to other support staff on the original amount. \n\nHer response was unprofessional. Those are the breaks of tip based service. If that location has a large number of uneducated tippers, she may need to leave.\n\nESH", "This is why I hate American tipping culture.

When using a coupon or alternate method of payment,  always tip on the total before the discount or your waiters are working for free.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nThe TIP is based on the original amount of the order, not based on your cost after coupons or gift cards.\n\nYour tip was an insult, and she rightly took it as such.", "YTA. You always use the original price to calculate the tip. The server should never have to suffer the loss just because you used a coupon - their efforts were the same regardless of your discount. Without the coupon you would've had a $70 bill and tipped accordingly. Worse, you occupied a table, so she lost out on any potential customers that would've sat there and paid an acceptable tip.", "YTA.  \n\n1) You tip on the value of the bill, not what you specifically paid for it\n\n2) She brought you drinks while you waited, thus, she gave you service. You tip Baristas/bar tenders don't you? \n\n3) She packaged up your food for you, To Go orders are a massive pain, who exactly do you think puts your food in the containers and makes sure you have condiments utensils, etc? If not her the kitchen staff who she tips out\n\n4) You sat at a table, thus taking away someone else sitting there, eliminating her ability to get a tip from that table. Regardless of whether it's the restaurant policy or not, you did it.", "Sigh, you do recognize that you are rationalizing leaving $5 on a $70 tab right?", "???? She gave you a drink and few boxes ? She didnt actually waited for your table for the meal ? 5 dollars is reasonable ? NTA", "ESH tips should be based on pre discount prices so in this case 20% of 70 or $14\n\nThe server was way out of line", "Tipping is expected on the total of the bill. $5 on 70 is 7%. Whether you paid by vouchers, gift cards, credit or cash, the service and cost provided was for $70. You got most of it for free anyways, what's another few bucks (of course only if you can afford it.)\n\nServers usually tip out based on total sales, meaning they share % of their total sales (not total tips,) with kitchen and support staff. So when tips are lower or not given, the server pays out of pocket to cover their tip out. And depending where you are, some servers don't even make minimum wage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSoft YTA, mostly b/c people don't get how it all works sometimes, or can't afford it. Also, soft AH to the server if it really was just a to go order...I'd still tip more than 7% but not necessarily too much more.", "Nta I tip 10% on to go food for the same reasons.  The water isn't doing all the waiter stuff that they usually do.", "YTA. Tip should have been on the original bill price, not your discounted price after vouchers", "So if you went out for a dinner that cost $210 and you had a $200 gift card, would you only tip on the $10 because that is all that is coming from your pocket? If you are going to tip, it should be on the value of the food. That being said, I don\u2019t know what I would tip in this sort of restaurant where you sit at a table for a to go order, so NAH?", "YTA mildly: Tips should be based on the original amount of the order not the discounted amount but it was a to-go and that reduces the tip %. As a rule of thumb I never tip less then $10.00 unless the food or service was bad.", "YTA  \n  \nThey have a mandatory minimum they have to declare in tips based on value rung up.  \n  \nTip on the original value next time.", "Gonna say ESH. \n\nAssuming this was in the US (not sure how tipping culture works elsewhere). It's bad form for servers to argue about the tip. \n\nHowever, tips should be in proportion to the total and not the discount. Even though you ordered the food to go, you still sat at the table and were served.
