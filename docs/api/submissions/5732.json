She needs a new career.", "NTA. She just brought you sodas, a $5 tip feels more than reasonable for that. It was a to-go order, she wasn't like she was waiting on a table you were at for a whole meal. I don't know where she works but usually the servers don't even deal in the to-go orders, they have to-go sales people for that so she most likely didn't assemble the order either.

I didn't create tipping culture, but this is how I personally cope with it.\n\nThis whole situation to me paints a picture of customers going into a restaurant and picking up carryout. The fact that OP must have been in a seating situation to get drink refills and get their food to the table for takeout does not sound like your typical sit-down restaurant situation to me. I'm no server but why would a server thinks this scenario warranted a full service tip? The vouchers here are irrelevant. Honestly I think a 7% tip isn't crazy for this odd situation, let alone throwing the money back at a customer because you felt insulted. That entitlement made me say NTA instead of NAH.

You could have tipped a little more, but you were going off your vouchers.", "NTA - you were just using a voucher given to you by the airline.

As a big proponent of tipping in the US, no one in their right mind should be expecting a large tip, if a tip at all, on a to go order. She\u2019s entitled and that entitlement ruins the case for tipping for all other service workers.", "Even if it was a to-go order, if it's mainly a dine-in restaurant most likely they withhold taxes on the original amount and she may have to tip out to other support staff on the original amount. \n\nHer response was unprofessional.

You always use the original price to calculate the tip. The server should never have to suffer the loss just because you used a coupon - their efforts were the same regardless of your discount.

You got most of it for free anyways, what's another few bucks (of course only if you can afford it.)\n\nServers usually tip out based on total sales, meaning they share % of their total sales (not total tips,) with kitchen and support staff. So when tips are lower or not given, the server pays out of pocket to cover their tip out. And depending where you are, some servers don't even make minimum wage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSoft YTA, mostly b/c people don't get how it all works sometimes, or can't afford it.

It's bad form for servers to argue about the tip. \n\nHowever, tips should be in proportion to the total and not the discount.

That server may not have served you a full sit down meal, but she had to place the order, get your to go cups of soda, and probably pack your order in bags with condiments, utensils, napkins and all the crap that to go orders require, thus taking time away from her being able to properly attend to her dining-in customers.", "YTA. You took up her time away from an actual paying table, and she did provide you a service. Depending on state (23 or so) still make $2.13 an hour as a server. Servers depend on tips to pay bills as you have a job that supports your ability to pay for airfare. It doesn't matter that the restaurant industry sucks or that it shouldn't be the consumers responsibility to supplement wages, ITS THE WAY IT IS. Shitting on the servers by stiffing their tips is not going to change the system.", "NTA. It was a carry-out meal, not sit down. For takeout I generally give a dollar or whatever coin change I receive, which isn't even necessary imo. For a sit down meal a tip is generally expected, and tipping 15% of the original check before a discount would make sense. If the staff keeps complaining like that to customers about tips I wouldn't be surprised if they got fired, they're going to deal with way more people leaving them less in tips and not acting kind about it in the future.", "Yes. YTA. You always tip on the original amount.", "I was so ready to say Y T A but as a former server, NTA. You had a to-go order and tipped for the amount of service you received.", "NTA. While it\u2019s standard to tip the whole amount not the discounted amount, that assumes full service not takeout.", "I always tip from the full price. But, in your case it was virtually a to go order and a full tip is not in order. $5 was plenty. NTA", "The food was Togo? The server was out of line. I mean she was out of line to bring anything up in any case, but in this situation I don\u2019t get why she was even upset. I don\u2019t ever expect people to tip on takeout and am happy to get a few bucks. \n\nIf someone tipped me really shitty on a sit-down meal I\u2019d be pissed or upset but I\u2019d NEVER act like that server did. It\u2019s part of the job. \n\nNTA", "YTA The tip goes to the cooks too ya know?", "Did she get your order together?", "NTA. I wouldn't have even tipped for a to go order,  $5 was plenty.", "YTA.", "NTA. No need to tip on a to-go order.", "I think $5 is fine considering all she did was bring your drinks and to-go containers. She doesn't need a higher tip unless she was taking your plates away and refilling your drinks. NTA", "NTA- was fully ready to call you out until I saw you got your food to go. Any tip on togo orders is appreciated. Sounds like you had an all around bad day.", "NTA\n\nEntitlement with tipping has gotten completely out of hand.\n\nThis is a *gratuity*.  Which is, by definition, something given *voluntarily* and *beyond obligation* for a service performed *beyond expectation*.\n\nNope.  Not the asshole for handing over a fiver for someone who literally did not a damn thing except for pour you some fountain drinks and hand you some bags of food.", "NTA. I hope you were on a southwest airlines! I\u2019ve been reading about the delays today", "NTA \n\nWow! \n\nAirport food is fast fast fast!\n\nI don\u2019t understand tipping as an Aussie though. \n\nWe just pay people! \n\nI would never leave a tip at any airport.", "NTA - there is no expectation to tip for a to-go order (even from a sit down restaurant).  Not all states have a below minimum wage tipped wage.  Putting items into a bag is not the equivalent amount of work as a sit down meal for a server whose employer has put them into a terrible situation that you the patron have no knowledge of.", "NTA. The nerve of her coming after you to confront a customer.", "NTA\nAmerican tipping culture is very weird, from an outsiders perspective isn\u2019t the tip supposed to be optional?", "NTA.  I maybe would have done at least 10%,  but it was a to go order.  $5 was more than enough for bringing drinks and the to go containers out.  I would have grabbed the $5 and offered it to the next worker I saw.", "NTA currently a waitress. That behavior is appalling. I never expect tips on takeout orders and usually skip the tip option before handing the machine over. We don\u2019t have to tip out on to go, so i don\u2019t really care either way.\n\nIf you were sitting down, it would be a different story. I\u2019m always a little bit annoyed when people only tip on the discounted portion, because I\u2019m usually the one convincing the manager to discount it. Plus, you saved X amount of money you WOULD have been spending, the least you could do it throw a little of the savings my way. But so is life, a small tip is better than none, so I\u2019m always appreciative either way.", "Nta I never tip on take out orders.", "NTA      \n$5 tip for a take-out order is fine.", "YTA. Boxing up your to go order takes as much effort as serving you, and you tip based on the amount on the bill, not based on what cash you personally shelled out. You were being cheap, and now you're trying to excuse/ justify that.", "Yuuuup. I was in the weeds once and must have done a bad job for a table and someone tipped me 2 cents to be funny adding some little constructive criticism note on the check. I just laughed and moved on. You have to have a short memory (relative to turning over tables) as a waiter.", "Do you know that waiters make $2.65 an hour.", "Fast food employees get paid hourly at like 12-20 per hour depending on location in the USA. Sit down restaurant dining gets paid less than 5 per hour as the culture is service base, and tip per percentage of overall total meal cost under the assumption the more the meal cost the more food you order thereby the more service the wait staff provided. \n\nIt\u2019s really not the same comparison with take out at fast food or fast casual compared to restaurant sit down dine in. However sit down dine in gets confusing bc the structures of the restaurant are not always the same from in place to another and can create tipping misunderstandings such as this.", "It wasn\u2019t a $10 tab. It was $70 and they didn\u2019t even have to spend their own money on most of it.", "They apparently had sodas. They were expected to tip 20% of the total bill when they only had soft drinks while waiting??? NTA.", "I agree. When you\u2019re sitting at a table waiting for food (even to-go) you are taking up a part of that server\u2019s section, even just for 30 mins or so as you wait. That server essentially loses a fully paying table if you don\u2019t tip well, and they lose money. Coming from a former server, YTA. In my eyes tipping a server is not about what service they did (unless it\u2019s really bad) but for their time.", "She served them sodas. If the rest of their order was $100, there\u2019s no reason to tip $20 for soda service when the rest of the order was to-go.", "> 20% minimum\n\nYeah, no.", "Horrible expectation. 15% avg for decent service. It goes up or down from there.", "It was a to-go order, it wasn\u2019t full table service. NTA.", "20% standard based on what??? 15% is the recommendation based on decent service, 20% on good service. In CA, even 20% at most places means you make more than most skilled tradesmen or professionals. I'm sure you are good at your job, but don't kid yourselves thinking tipping is a requirement. The more I read of this shit the last I want to tip. Tipping is an extra based on experience and accommodations.", "This is a problem for restaurants to solve, not the customers. Taking the orders, delivering their drinks, and delivering to go food took what, 5 min of time? Total, for all aspect. Lets be generous and assume 10 minutes for all. $5 tip, aside from normal wage, assuming one table an hour is still $30/hr. Pull your heads out of your asses and do the math. Oh but she had to pay this person and this person...blah blah blah. She had several tables, she still made more an hour than a lot of people. It's their choice to earn that income.", "They did sit down at a table though. They just didn\u2019t eat the food there.", "They did not eat at the table and take up space any longer than was necessary. This changes your argument.", "You must be dense as you are obviously not understanding the situation. They were served sodas, nothing more because there were no \"to go\" options at the counter.", "I\u2019m with you. OP was cheap. Someone needs the money more than me.", "Well for the 5 minutes it took her to get drinks and bring them their food she was making 60 bucks an hour", "I was a waitress. $5 for 10 minutes of bagging up the food was great. I had other tables during that time and 50 minutes to make more money", "Do you know that this takes place somewhere that is $2.65/hr for servers? My understanding was, that was only true in something like 15 states.", "That's their choice. They don't deserve high tips for doing the absolute bare minimum. She literally brought drinks and to-go boxes, no different from what a drive-thru cashier at McDonalds would do and they don't get tipped at all.", "As much of an ass hole a lot of us may be, tipping is not a requirement, it is an option. No one forces them to take that position. $70 at a table with service for an hour with good service should deserve a tip, but a to go order is different. Tipping is getting out of hand. Anywhere I pay for anything now there is a tipping expectation, including the entrance fee to watch my kid play the sports I pay for. The tipping culture and expectations have to change!", "How many hours did it take to bring a few sodas", "Sometimes restaurant have wait staff do take out and your comment about table threw me off like you were holding a table of theirs so they couldn\u2019t serve another party while your food was being made. Other times they have someone dedicated to take out that whole night or sometimes the bar person does take out or host stand, where you wouldn\u2019t sit at a table and hold up another party being served.  I\u2019m not sure your comment provided any more clarity in that sense if you were holding their table preventing them from making money while your food was being cooked. \n\nI always feel a bit loss in guidance when it comes to tipping To go bc dine-in restaurant sorta does it differently depending on their system. However based on your description of nothing being served than sodas and the signage directed to go to a table, I think you were NTA. \n\nBut the servers reaction was quite outspoken, as if you all were holding a table and preventing them from actually making money to serve anyone. I personally (from friends and experience) don\u2019t think server are the type to expect to get 20% when they know they didnt actually provide a service aka take out. However this might be a flaw in their restaurant and how it\u2019s ran (to go order sitting at table preventing a real dine in table from being sat). Which I wouldn\u2019t expect a patron to clearly know these in and outs so still NTA. But truly this is sorta a sucky situation and your hand was forced", "So you took up a table that otherwise would have been available for a party that could have ordered and tipped.  That pushes me towards a YTA verdict, even though normally I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with a $5 tip for a takeout order.", "According to the department of labor, that's only true in a small part of the US - like, essentially, just the south.   Many places pay full wages regardless of tipping.", "It\u2019s not about the service. She took up a table at that servers section- one that could have been filled with actually paying people.", "True, but they didn\u2019t get dine in service. They were just waiting for their takeout order and as soon as they got it they left.", "If they are a tip receiving employee, they are being paid as little as $2.13/hour in the US.", "They\u2019re being paid peanuts for it. Which is kinda why tipping is a thing in the first place.", "Yeah a whole two dollars an hour.", "Hahahaha police not entitled XD Good one", "Healthcare worker here, waitresses are definitely on the most undervalued in the work force", "i waited tables for a few years and am now a first responder, and i definitely made way more money waiting tables (on $2 an hour plus tips, even with being stiffed frequently) and people were also much nicer to me. but it\u2019s not all about the money or being treated nicely. my S/O is also in the medical field and people treat him worse than i was ever treated as a server. we see people on their worst days so it comes with the territory, but it seems like people who have never done these jobs make a lot of assumptions.", "It is absolutely about the service. And not necessarily the quality (I\u2019m a big proponent of tipping 20% regardless if you think the service was awful, bc servers depend on tips for their livelihood ); but if I go to a restaurant and a server spends an hour or two attending to my needs and wants to make sure my dining experience is optimal, then why am I expected to tip the same amount for a to-go order where the service is not at all expected? Tipping for the soft drinks while they waited at an airport restaurant is normal and expected but not tipping on the full amount of the to-go order. \n\nIf the airport restaurant was packed, it seems unlikely the family would have been seated to wait for their to-go order, so my assumption is the restaurant was not packed, but given that it\u2019s the holidays, I realize I may be wrong. So, in the unlikely scenario that the restaurant was packed, it was the holidays, and the family was tone-deaf enough to occupy a table while waiting and didn\u2019t tip to account for that, then I agree with you.", "It\u2019s not standard. Tipping is about the quality of service. You don\u2019t provide service for a takeout order you put it in a bag.", "can we stop pretending all states pay waiters $2/hr? my state pays $10/hr. talk about false equivalences....", "Not tipping the waitstaff does nothing other than screw over a low wage employee. Changing tipping culture needs to happen by changing the laws around waitstaff pay or by changing company policy. Neither of those are affected by the tips received by the waitstaff. \n\nIf you actually want to make a difference, lobby a politician or a restaurant executive or organize a protest or strike. Don\u2019t take money away from those that need it.", "If you really wanted to be the change, you'd announce that you dont intend to tip before you order.\n\nOtherwise you are just a cheap lowlife getting a service paid for by others, including the server, who is taxed on sales.", ">Be the change you want to see in the world.\n\nUh, yeah\u2026this is for like being nice to people, picking up trash and that sort of thing. Not stiffing your waiter. You shouldn\u2019t be ok with benefiting from peoples work when you know they aren\u2019t making a dime off of it.", "This is not true in all states!", "incredulous. im not sure where u are from but nobody should be tipping. in fact, in many cultures its an insult to tip. maybe grow up and stop enforcing your needs on others. if you want to make a difference, it starts from yourself. stop propagating toxic culture."]}
