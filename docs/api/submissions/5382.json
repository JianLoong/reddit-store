The first time she saw him she refused to come in the house.\n\nWe have a pretty big house, so family meals are usually held at mine.

We used two solutions: a  muzzle for short periods and barriers for longer periods. The home allowed me to be at one end of the house, while he was at the other end. I knew my escape routes,  for the inevitabe occasions when he got loose. Everyone knew to yell if he got loose, so I could duck outside, or into closet or bathroom while they rounded him up. Usually,  with a house full of people, a couple of people stepped up as additional barriers between us. I was never bitten a second time,  he and I got used to each other until I got to a point where I would take the muzzle off during the visit (he always started the visit with the muzzle).\n\nOf course,  your daughter's dog is not really a bite risk, but establishing protocols and protections that everyone takes seriously may give the girlfriend the peace of mind to be included.", "ESH\n\nWhile I don't want to downplay the importance of emotional support animals and the relationship that your daughter and the dog have, she clearly hasn't had an emotional support animal her entire life, and the dog was not raised to be an ESA, he just kind of fell into that role.

But you already know what they say about assumptions.", "that\u2019s so fucking sad & terrible. i\u2019m glad he has family members that understand & stick up for him to other adults that don\u2019t even try. my best friends older sister has cerebral palsy & is in a wheelchair, i once got in a shouting match with a stranger at the store for laughing at her. a grown man!! bestie & i were about 17, her sister was 20 or 21. some people are just heartless monsters.", "Him and his parents are very lucky to have you. People get so wrapped up in someone\u2019s challenges they all too often forget all of the joy that person can bring and the fulfilling life they can have.", "My nephew is the same.", "Autistic adult. Can confirm this is NOT the case- part of autism is also an inability to regulate emotional state, beyond body language mute.", "I think the obvious compromise is for girlfriend to not show up. The child clearly comes before the girlfriend - especially on something like Christmas, which is much more a children\u2019s thing than an adult thing anyways. Cousin will survive having to spend a few hours without his girlfriend.", "I totally agree but we dont know if its a phobia, trauma response, or her just lying bc she really doesnt like dogs or is allergic, or what. We dont know.", "Fair point but the dog being a genuine service dog versus an emotional support animal makes a huge difference. Because OP could choose to be an A H and insist that the dog come with his daughter to the cousin's house. I don't think he would ever push that but he absolutely could.", "but OP is trying to compromise. the cousin is not. that makes him an AH.\n\nseriously, the audacity of this guy! he comes into OP's home, eats OP's food, and expects OP's child to inconvenience herself for them.", "larger dogs are often very good as autism service dogs as they can provide physical comfort and pressure, as well as a sense of protection :) I personally being autistic and having ptsd if possible would like to train a samoyed as an assistance dog. but yeah I really hate the idea that autistic people suddenly dont need assistance animals as adults - even those with lower support needs can benefit from one.", "You mean where she is on the spectrum with her needs. There are no levels when your autistic.", "Not for all dog fears. For some little dogs are a bigger trigger. Having been bit in the rear ankle (right above my heel) by little dogs that were mean as spit, I can relate. I'm not afraid of them, but am more wary than of larger dogs.", "Agreed.", "I guess we don\u2019t know but we\u2019ve only got this post to go on and it\u2019s quite a common phobia so I\u2019m just taking it as is. The whole story could be a lie \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I just want to point out that there is never a zero risk of a dog biting you. Hundreds of people are attacked and killed or injured by dogs every year and they are almost always family pets and not feral or wild dogs. The OPs therapy dog has a trusting relationship with the OP and daughter, but I can understand the girlfriend's fear. I have been attacked twice, once by a pair of dobermains and the second time by a rottweiler and both times the dogs belonged to family friends and knew me well, but got over excited or acted out of character and attacked me. Over time I have managed to control my fear and I like dogs and wouldn't mind them as pets if I had a yard, but I still will never let a big dog near my face since that is where I was attacked. I really hate the lack of respect that people have for the attack piwer of dogs and that their precious pooky wooky is never a danger. They may be low risk, but it isn't zero.\n\nIn this situation though, ther are many options to accomodate the cousin's girlfriend that the cousin just didn't want to do because he is an A.H.", "you\u2019re a bad person.", "I am some of the lowest level of diagnosed requiring support. I have two pups. Even a small pup can provide deep pressure therapy- they just use all their body instead of a small bit of it.", "I'm autistic, and used to have a support dog, a huge Malinois/Rottweiler mix, and she was a perfect angel. She helped me so much. RIP Miss Butts.", "Agreed. Pressure is very important. Unfortunately, it's very hard to find professionally trained dogs for anxiety and adult autism, and if you can find someone willing to train one for that reason, it's still very expensive.", "Very true. Regardless NTA bc its OPs house", "You're probably right, my point wasn't so much about the dogs (much more of a cat person as evidenced by my username). More that we can acknowledge phobias are irrational and still be considerate of them.", "CPTSD and my 12 pound Pekingese stands on me with her full little body weight to calm me down", "honestly i have a rabbit and even him sitting on my chest for treats helps sometimes lmao \ud83d\ude2d", "Are you sure you\u2019re not the cousin or the girlfriend because you sure seem to be acting like you are. Like. A phobia is something that the gf can\u2019t control and I get that. Expecting the op and his daughter to be able to bring the service dog to their house would be an unreasonable request because it\u2019s gf\u2019s home and she has something that she can\u2019t control that would make her fearful in her home. This is OP\u2019s daughters home and the dog is her service animal and she needs him so she\u2019s not fearful in her home around strangers. OP has offered multiple solutions and the entire family isn\u2019t engaging with them. No one is offering to host or pay for dinner out.  You\u2019re demanding all this empathy for an adult with a phobia that I understand. Why don\u2019t you seem to be extending that same empathy to a child?", "I did this with my guinea pigs and other small rodents too. Explains also why I always wanted a stuffy with me.", "Bunnies are amazing. I had my boy for nearly 10 years and he helped me through my illness. He was almost like a puppy, following me around and just hanging out :)", "Except OP has said multiple times they would WELCOME the cousin hosting and would be totally fine with leaving the child and dog with the mother. This is completely a matter of the cousin wanting to have the cake and eat it too - \"YOU cook and host, AND cater to my gf.\""]}
