He's an antolian shepherd, so a big scary dog - he was initially supposed to be a livestock guardian for my dad but when I took my daughter to meet him they kind of bonded. We ended up with him a few weeks later due to him being generally bad at his job and now he works to support my daughter (and she absolutely loves him).\n\nThis is all to say we have a very big dog who looks very mean sometimes. He's sweet as anything, though. \n\nMy cousins girlfriend is terrified of dogs. The first time she saw him she refused to come in the house.\n\nWe have a pretty big house, so family meals are usually held at mine. This is obviously posing an issue as his girlfriend won't come into my house because of the dog.\n\nWe have crated him for very short periods so she could come in, but she's clearly very uncomfortable, and my daughter gets very nervous around new people without him present. \n\nI've explained that there isn't any compromise to make, and my cousin is quite annoyed, asking why we couldn't just leave the dog home and eat elsewhere.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't mind, as I could just leave my daughter with her mom, but no one else wants to cook lol. In my opinion if he wants to reinforce family bonding so much he should offer to cook.\n\nAnyway, its a serious issue right now and causing arguments within family. It all came to a head last night when they dropped off my dad; he's staying for Christmas. \n\nAnyway, my cousin started yelling, asked me why I hated his girlfriend so much and couldn't accommodate her. I told him his girlfriends fears weren't as important to me as my daughters comfort.\n\nMy dad ended up cooling it down and essentially called me an asshole. She can't control her fears and all that.\n\nSo, AITA?

In my opinion if he wants to reinforce family bonding so much he should offer to cook.\n\nYour cousin is an absolute twit. If he wants a dog free location for the family meal then he should be the one figuring things out. But my personal opinion is that this compromise doesn't work either. Let's say he does offer to host and cook. That's fine and all, but now your daughter is the one left out. Why should she have to sit out the family meal for the cousin's girlfriend? \n\nPut your daughter first. The cousin and girlfriend can either deal with it or make separate plans as a couple.", "NTA...It's very clear who is more vulnerable and who has more control over the situation. Your cousin needs to get a big house where he can host all the meals and make all of the rules if this is that important to him.", "Gonna go with NAH - You both have a right to place your daughter and girlfriend as respective priorities. He is going to worry about his girlfriend because she is his priority and you'll worry about your daughter because she is your priority.\n\nI don't think there are any AHs here - but there really isn't a good solution to make without the other being uncomfortable. I'm sorry OP.", "NTA. He isn't wrong that you could leave her and the dog at home, but you're right, her needs are more important. I completely understand being scared, I'm not scared of dogs but there's tons of things I'm terrified of and wouldn't go near. But your daughter needs the dog, and she is more important.", "NTA, child needs > teen (young adult?) nervous.", "NTA ignoring everything else, if he wants to eat in your home then he plays by your rules. The dog lives here- he does not. If he doesn\u2019t want to be near the dog then he shouldn\u2019t come.", "NTA. For 1, your daughter is a CHILD. An autistic one at that and she can't just be \"fixed\". For 2, his girlfriend is an ADULT with a fear of dogs and that can be fixed. For 3, it's your house, so your rules. For 4, you are doing an amazing job as her mother by protecting her and doing what's in her best interest.", "NAH. Look the dog helps your daughter & that takes priority. But has the specifically been trained? Can the dog go to school & non dog friendly stores. Our is dog pet that happens allow your daughter to be a little more stable?\n\nNext on to the girlfriend, fears are real and illogical at times, there\u2019s no controlling them. I\u2019m 43 have unrealistic fear of the dark, something happened to me as child that caused the fear. I have obscene amount night lights in my house.  The girlfriend is your cousin priority. Your family seems like y\u2019all are close and this difficult situation. I just think as family you have to agree to disagree and everyone needs to understand that for time being your cousin will not be over to your home. Your cousin should read up on autism and understand how pets help people with autism. You should get more information on fears, because I can promise you sometimes theirs no control.", "Nta\n\nYou offered him a compromise, he can host and cook. It is your daughter (and her dogs's) home, so they should never be expected, or forced, to be uncomfortable while there. \n\nIf he doesn't want the compromise you offered, then he needs to find a better one. The problem is he doesn't want any extra responsibility, he wants you to do all the work and make all the sacrifices.", "NTA. Your cousin sounds like a jerk who can\u2019t explain to his gf why the dog is necessary. Don\u2019t exclude your daughter from family events, especially for the sake of someone who isn\u2019t in your family.", "NTA. Your daughter's needs come first.", "NTA.\n\nYour cousin's girlfriend can't control her fears? That's nice. Your ***autistic daughter can't control her fears either, and it's her fucking house.***\n\nYour cousin and dad both need to get over themselves before they stop getting invited for christmas.", "NTA. It's your house, your daughters house, and your dogs house, not their house. You're absolutely right in telling your cousin that your daughter is more important than his girlfriend", "NTA. \ud83d\ude44 I have, and I\u2019m aware that this is unpopular, very little sympathy for adults who let their anxieties take control of them to this level. Get a hold of yourself. I have GA, depression, and an insane fear of sharks. If docile sharks were a common pet in our world, and I would occasionally need to get in the family pool with a shark in it, I would take a Clonopin, and/or remind myself that my feelings are not facts, and sit on the equivalent of a sofa far away from the shark/dog. She\u2019s an adult, and she needs to be in charge of herself. Your daughter\u2019s autism AND the fact that she\u2019s a child AND it\u2019s your dang house - oy you\u2019re totally fine. Maybe keep the dog on the other side of an interior doggy fence but nope yoire totally good.", "NTA, though there might be a compromise solution.\n\n My niece's dog(pit bull) didn't like me. As in bit me the first time we met. I've never been afraid of dogs,  but understandably I was nervous around that dog. Just as you,  my sister had the big house and hosted most family get-togethers. We used two solutions: a  muzzle for short periods and barriers for longer periods. The home allowed me to be at one end of the house, while he was at the other end. I knew my escape routes,  for the inevitabe occasions when he got loose. Everyone knew to yell if he got loose, so I could duck outside, or into closet or bathroom while they rounded him up. Usually,  with a house full of people, a couple of people stepped up as additional barriers between us. I was never bitten a second time,  he and I got used to each other until I got to a point where I would take the muzzle off during the visit (he always started the visit with the muzzle).", "ESH\n\nWhile I don't want to downplay the importance of emotional support animals and the relationship that your daughter and the dog have, she clearly hasn't had an emotional support animal her entire life, and the dog was not raised to be an ESA, he just kind of fell into that role. This isn't a seeing eye dog, or a medical alert dog, or in a situation where a medical professional said \"she needs a support animal\" and you went and got an animal specifically trained for this.\n\nRealistically I think your daughter could probably be without the dog in the same room as her for a few hours while you have a family dinner.\n\nIf your cousins girlfriend has such an issue with this he could offer to have everyone over to his house. Or rent a space where it could be hosted. Or do anything to come up with a solution that works for everyone.", "NTA.\n\nIf he's your daughter's actual support dog, then absolutely they don't get to ask to leave him behind.", "INFO- is this dog a certified support dog? Or have you as the parent labeled him as a support dog and are just using the term? \n\nI'm leaning towards NTA. Like you said if your cousin is so concerned about his girlfriend and wants to have these family gathering then he can do it at his own house and make the rules. He can't go over to someone else's house and dictate what they do with their animals", "NTA but you really need to clarify in the post that this IS a trained service animal, even if your daughter prefers the word support. A lot of people will be screaming about untrained dogs if you don\u2019t clarify.", "NTA. He wants to come into YOUR home. If he doesn't like the situation he should have a better plan than telling you it has to be his way.", "NTA. 1) Your house your rules. Anyone who doesn't like the rules is welcome to go away. 2) It's your daughter's and the dog's home. See rule #1.", "Nta\n\nImagine coming into YOUR home, eating YOUR feed and expecting you to get rid of the dog that calms YOUR daughter. \n\nFunny how they can all complain, but none offer to open their home and bank account to change the house. \n\nAsk him and your dad why they both hate your daughter. Since they both like to open their entitled mouth to spew ridiculousness. \n\nThe sheer audacity.", "NTA That woman is an adult and she has way more control if her emotions than your daughter does. You are NOT TA.", "This is a hard one.\n\n~~From what I understand, it's not a legit service dog. It's an emotional support dog. Right? It wasn't prescribed by a doctor and never had any kind of official training ?~~\n\n~~I would tend to say gentleY TA for using a dog as a crutch for your kid instead of working on fixing her issues. It's not a real service dog, so she won't be able to take him everywhere, anytime, and sooner or later, she'll be in situation where her dog is not allowed/welcomed. Just like the current situation~~\n\n~~You need to figure out with her doctor how to get over her insecurities without relying on an unreliable source of comfort.~~\n\nOP confirmed the dog is a legit service dog, so NTA. This is a medical requirement for his daughter, so the dog gets to stay, no questions asked.", "NTA. I'm scared of dogs, and probably would be terrified of yours at first. But, I also understand that your daughter has more severe issues than I do, and also, it's her house", "NTA tell your cousin he can host and why isn\u2019t he putting his GFs needs before his. It\u2019s his choice to make. His GF isn\u2019t to blame but to accommodate her would be to much harm for you.", "Since when are Anatolians scary? They're literally just a bit on the larger side and fluffy?  \n\nNTA and cousin's gf can just grow up and either choose to attend and deal with being around the dog, or just don't come.

I see one and freak out while trying  it to. However, this situation is different you have one person who afraid but, another who needs this dog. As an adult I would simple try to ignore it or not go. Like if you know the dog is there why would you keep showing up. And to expect them to get rid of their dog is crazy.", "The role of a support animal is a bit different from a service animal. For an autistic child and their parents when you finally find something that works, you cleave to it. Yes,  there was a \"before\", which may seem have meant melt downs,  going non-verbal around strangers, head banging, etc.  any number of responses that the parents do not want to risk occuring.", "Newsflash- Most service dogs are chosen and trained by their owners or friends/family. The need is far greater than the number of animals trained by dedicated service dog organizations.", "It IS a service dog that has been fully trained. Not an ESA. OP clarifies in the comments, also, the daughter prefers the word support dog instead of service dog, hence why that word is used.
