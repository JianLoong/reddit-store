We used two solutions: a  muzzle for short periods and barriers for longer periods. The home allowed me to be at one end of the house, while he was at the other end. I knew my escape routes,  for the inevitabe occasions when he got loose. Everyone knew to yell if he got loose, so I could duck outside, or into closet or bathroom while they rounded him up. Usually,  with a house full of people, a couple of people stepped up as additional barriers between us. I was never bitten a second time,  he and I got used to each other until I got to a point where I would take the muzzle off during the visit (he always started the visit with the muzzle).\n\nOf course,  your daughter's dog is not really a bite risk, but establishing protocols and protections that everyone takes seriously may give the girlfriend the peace of mind to be included.", "ESH\n\nWhile I don't want to downplay the importance of emotional support animals and the relationship that your daughter and the dog have, she clearly hasn't had an emotional support animal her entire life, and the dog was not raised to be an ESA, he just kind of fell into that role.
