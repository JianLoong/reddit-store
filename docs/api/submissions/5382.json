He's sweet as anything, though. \n\nMy cousins girlfriend is terrified of dogs. The first time she saw him she refused to come in the house.\n\nWe have a pretty big house, so family meals are usually held at mine. This is obviously posing an issue as his girlfriend won't come into my house because of the dog.\n\nWe have crated him for very short periods so she could come in, but she's clearly very uncomfortable, and my daughter gets very nervous around new people without him present. \n\nI've explained that there isn't any compromise to make, and my cousin is quite annoyed, asking why we couldn't just leave the dog home and eat elsewhere.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't mind, as I could just leave my daughter with her mom, but no one else wants to cook lol.

We used two solutions: a  muzzle for short periods and barriers for longer periods. The home allowed me to be at one end of the house, while he was at the other end. I knew my escape routes,  for the inevitabe occasions when he got loose. Everyone knew to yell if he got loose, so I could duck outside, or into closet or bathroom while they rounded him up. Usually,  with a house full of people, a couple of people stepped up as additional barriers between us. I was never bitten a second time,  he and I got used to each other until I got to a point where I would take the muzzle off during the visit (he always started the visit with the muzzle).\n\nOf course,  your daughter's dog is not really a bite risk, but establishing protocols and protections that everyone takes seriously may give the girlfriend the peace of mind to be included.", "ESH\n\nWhile I don't want to downplay the importance of emotional support animals and the relationship that your daughter and the dog have, she clearly hasn't had an emotional support animal her entire life, and the dog was not raised to be an ESA, he just kind of fell into that role.

All the adults are just pointing fingers at each other.", "> why shouldn\u2019t cousin finally take some of the burden for a change to make an accommodation for his gf?\n\nThey need to work *together* to find a solution that accommodates *both* GF *and* kid. Saying that one person bears the burden is exactly the problem! Neither of them wants to work together to create a win win situation.

What\u2019s not reasonable is to expect someone to get rid of their dog, who is a resident of their home, to cater to someone\u2019s discomfort when that person could alleviate the problem by offering to host/cook in their own home.  \n\nNTA", "OP also clearly stated he'd happily go to another house but no-one wants to cook.", "At his home... there is no compromise to make in his own home... his daughter is the most important person for OP there, and he's not willing to compromise about that, and that is perefctly valid. \n\nAlso as an autistic person myself, OP's attitude about his daughter's wellbeing, makes me happy. \n\nThere is a possible compromise overall, and it's eating elsewhere as a family, but NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

It's Christmas, and OP's cousin is finding out that they won't be able to make a family event due to the presence of a dog. I'm going to guess this happens quite frequently and, that it happening specifically on a holiday, is just frustrating to deal with. \n\nI do have to wonder, too, if OP's cousin *did* host... would anyone pitch a fit over a child being excluded from a family event because her dog can't be there?", "I'm not discounting *any* of that. In fact, both of these things can be true. OP's daughter needs her dog, *and* OP's cousin is feeling excluded from family events.", "> they are coming for the meal\n\nSo... that could change? Like, yeah, if nothing changes then nothing can change... but things can change? They can do things differently to accommodate family members? Na, doing anything different isn't OP's problem so fuck the cousin and his GF, they just aren't part of the family any more. ????", "> Restaurant is iffy on holidays man\n\nRestaurant is one example, the actual solution doesn't matter. Whether a given solution is the correct one is irrelevant to whether or not a solution can exist. It obviously can.", "> They won't be able to eat at a restaurant for free\n\nYou can't eat at anybody's house for free either, somebody buys that shit. It doesn't even matter though, how about gathering somewhere for something other than a meal? Then the question of who cooks and who buys food is entirely moot! There are solutions here! Y'all seem to be bending over backwards to try and ignore how many solutions could be possible here, but it seems like y'all just desperately want the GF to be the problem because you don't want to validate phobias or something. There are a whole bunch of adults here, and all of them seem to be saying \"we've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas\"", "But my point is that OP takes this as confrontational. OP isn't backing up the cousin with the rest of the family, OP is saying this is your problem. Not like, I see you have a problem that means how we've been doing things doesn't work, not saying to other family \"I can't host because of the dog\" but just saying \"figure it out, you're on your own, if you can't come to family gatherings the bye\" which is shitty!", "I see your point. I think the adults in the situation should have a little more empathy for the child opposed to the other adult tho.", "It sounds like OP\u2019s cousin is welcome to take on the hosting duties. No one is excluding the gf. She and the cousin are just unwilling to offer up an alternate solution. Saying they can have it somewhere else is not a solution. A solution is saying \u201cwe\u2019ll do it at our house\u201d or \u201cRestaurant X has availability on these dates to accommodate a party of our size. I can make the reservation.\u201d"]}
