She and I would go out all the time, she would offer me advice, and all around treat me like a little sister.

She said of course she would be there and she wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world and yet she still did. I never got an acknowledgment then either, though she did brag to me how every weekend she was driving five hours to go see her boyfriend and driving another five hours back home. \n\nThere has been several other celebrations she has been invited to but I have since stopped talking to her unless absolutely necessary. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being over dramatic or not or if I\u2019m justified in being so angry and hurt over her not coming to any of these celebrations, am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: For clarification, my sister and I have different moms but the same dad. I say \u201cour\u201d parents in the post because my sister\u2019s mother was not a very good mother and generally not a very good person either and my mom is the type to want to take in every child she can, even if they\u2019re not hers. We tried for years (all of my childhood actually) to get custody of my sister, but her mother never wanted to give her to us despite my sister ending up in a less than ideal situation with people who were not family simply so she could continue collecting child support for her from my dad.", "created_utc": 1667129119, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhbyoa/aita_for_refusing_to_forgive_my_older_sister/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She hasn\u2019t stopped disappointing and hurting you though so why should you forgive unless you want to? You are entitled to your feelings it\u2019s what you do with them that matters. You can be hurt and mad and upset, absolutely. If you were wanting to lash out and cause her harm or pain too, THAT would be a problem. Have your feelings and maybe even talk to her about it. Limiting contact may be what you need and space but you also can\u2019t improve the relationship that way if you\u2019d like to. It\u2019s entirely valid though. She continually disappoints you saying she\u2019ll come and doesn\u2019t, I\u2019d stop inviting someone to stuff too then. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been so disappointed and hurt by her, I hope someday she might recognize that and apologizes.

But I think you're  not really her priority. As for your sister, she has a mom, so why would your mother want to have a custody of her? Even though to your opinion she's less of a mom, she's still her mom and takes care of her. And you can't separate a child and a mom just because you thing the mom is collecting money from the child support. Please know some boundaries. And please don't have high expectations on her. Just love her but keep some distance. Just forgive her cuz forgiveness is actually for you to move on. But don't expect her to come to anything you've invited. You will be calm that way. Don't cut ties with her just keep her at arm length. You like her. Just enjoy times that you have with her but don't make her your priority.  Some peoples are like that to us.", "I like this comment. OP needs to readjust her expectations of her sister so she stops getting hurt. Whether that means allowing for space for her in her life in a way that doesn't expect her to show up for things or where it's going low or no contact. I hope OP does whatever is best for them. It sounds like she really cares about her sister so I hope she can maintain a relationship with her if possible. Good luck OP.", "This is such an eloquent and mature response.", "I appreciate this insight, honestly. I appreciate your honesty and the fact that you even offered me options of how to go about this. It never even occurred to me that I could think of her as someone I can love but not count on and that I don\u2019t need to totally cut her out. Obviously I\u2019m going to need to work on not being so hurt over every ignored invite, but this was an exceedingly helpful comment and I appreciate it! Thank you! :)", "Do your best and take frequent breaks if it is too hard.  It goes both ways - if you find yourself doing a lot for her and resenting it, say no, that you cannot make that event/spending/whatever your priority right now."]}
