What he always does is ask me \"what are we doing.\" Now I typically don't mind when other students asks me, i get it, sometimes we zone out and don't pay attention and have to ask for help, it happens to me too. But what I don't do is ask 2-5 times a class. At the beginning of class the teacher will be explaing something like \"Okay so as you can see there is a sheet on your desk. Answer part I, we'll go over it in 4 minutes.\" Now, after maybe 30 seconds Moham will always ask me \"what are we doing?\" like... bro. She literally just told us, did you even read the paper? It has directions on it as well. If this was a one off thing or once in a week thing it defitnetly won't bother me but he does this many times a class.\n\nSo yesterday was pretty much just another day, we were in class, the teacher said the instructions, they were on the sheet, they were on the smartboard as well im pretty sure. And ofcource, Moham asked me \"what are we doing.\" So i told him: read the instructions, answer the questions. There were 2 questions asking for the directions of two words, \"fair\" and \"it\". We had dictionarys on our desk so we open the dictionary and wrote down the definition. 3 minutes pass and the teacher is going over the question, \"so what is the third definition of 'fair'? That's right blahblah..\" then Moham asks me again **while** she's talking. \"What is the definition of fair?\" I look at his paper, he has nothing written down for either question. I tell him she's literally going over it right now, he later proceeds to ask me again for the definition of 'it'. Literally what is wrong with your ears? I just turned my sheet over to him and let him copy. \n\nBy the end of class the teacher told us to read pages 11-17 and finish part 3 and 4 (the rest of the worksheet) for homework. Moham asks me what are we doing. I tell him to read pages 11-17 for homework and complete the rest of the worksheet. I then tell him to pay more attention during class because its really annoying being constantly asked what's going on. He then starts arguing back with me like wtf? He's saying stuff like its hard to follow along. At this point I was really annoyed and said in a assertive voice so the class could hear rather easily, something along the lines of \n\n\"omg, how the hell did you get into honors English? You really can't listen to a thing the teacher says. Do you not have any shame asking me what;s going on 10 times a day? She just said what's for homework.\" \n\nThe classroom was rather silent and Moham looked at me with a look in his eyes, I just looked away and started putting my binder and pen away. The teacher broke the silence and repeated what to do for homework before the bell rang. I talked about it to my friend at lunch today as a funny story but he said that I was kinda being a dick, calling him out infront of the entire class. He didn't show up today\n\nSo AITA\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1697674231, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17b5j1z/aita_for_embarrasing_an_annoying_student_that/", "score": 476, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I called out and embarresed him infront of the class. My friend told me that even though he was annoying, I should've just ignored or put up with him because he was a very antisocial and introverted student who would probably die from the embarresment (He was in our class in our freshman year so we know him a little). I was very annoyed as I believe i'm pretty much a saint for putting up with him for so long and still answering his questions. My friend says I should've just ignored him so he gets the hint and stops asking me if I was annoyed. He didn't show up to class today which may just be a coincidence but if what I did made him too scared to go to school I honestly feel he's way too fragile.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Fortunately, I never made it anyone else's problem because I also had crippling social anxiety so I just suffered my confusion in silence lol. But I've *also* been the \"'mature' girl who gets paired up with needy boys and expected to meet their needs\" (because the ADHD didn't get in the way of me being considered \"mature\" since I masked so well).

You made yourself an enemy when you could have had a friend.  Years later Moham will still think of you as \u201cthe dick who embarrassed me in front of the whole class\u201d instead of \u201cthe awesome dude who helped me every day when I had undiagnosed ADHD.\u201d  And you never know when you might need a friend.  But we all do stupid things in high school, and it\u2019s not too late to salvage the relationship.  But you\u2019re going to have to apologize, and help him get the help he needs.", "YTA with the understanding that this behavior would annoy anyone. But the answer would have been to talk to your teacher about your concerns. Moham may have a  LD, and considered you someone safe to ask help from. Maybe, maybe not, but now you have embarrassed him in front of the class. At this point I would still talk to the teacher and explain your outburst and why it happened so that Mohan can get the actual help he needs, or she can move your seat away from him so you are undisturbed.", "YTA - Given that you didn't mention him being disruptive other than needing help with what is going on I'm assuming that he was only bothering you when he needed help following along.\n\nAssuming that, this is a great chance at a life lesson we all have to go through learning empathy. Whether he is struggling because he is going deaf, having trouble understanding the language, was placed in the wrong class, or for a reason that you will never know, he was asking for help and while the requests for help were overwhelming talking privately to him and/or your teacher would have been the best way to handle this.\n\nI'm guessing while it was an annoyance for you, he looked at you as someone he trusted for help and had that trust broken when you decides to expose his vulnerability to everyone and that's why he wasn't at school the next day. I'd apologize for calling him out and if the teacher hasn't addressed the problem after your initial blowup to talk to someone about them about it.", "YTA. I understand that you were annoyed, but it's still a dick move.", "NTA- just start ignoring him whenever he asks you anything. Its not your job to be his parent in class.", "NTA", "NTA. While Mohan might have some sort of disability, which is my theory. It still isnt an excuse to disrupt class and other students (you), personally i would have talked to the teacher and then confront him if the teacher didnt do shit. But i dont blame you bc im annoyed for you", "NTA, but talk with your teacher. She needs to deal with this. Maybe Moham has ADD; maybe he has issues at home that are making him a mess; maybe drugs or alcohol are an issue. None of that is your responsibility. Moreover, his interruptions are hurting YOUR ability to focus and learn in class.\n\nThe easy solution for your benefit is to have one of you change seats, but that only transfers the problem to someone else. The teacher may need to talk with Moham/his parents and go from there in addressing his issues. In the meantime, she may at least move his seat to closer to her so that she notice when he's lost and deal with it.", "NTA at all his learning issues are not your problem. If he continues tell the teacher.", "NTA. He chose not to pay attention. And if he has some mental illness that makes it impossible to pay attention, then he shouldn\u2019t be in your class regardless. You said a mean thing, but you only said it after he had been relying on you for laziness for a long time. Next time he asks what\u2019s happening, ignore him. If he keeps asking, ignore him.", "NTA, since he has been constantly asking you.  However, does he have a language issue?  Sounds like English might not be his native tongue.  \n\nI'd have a separate conversation with the teacher and tell her that he seems to be having difficulty understanding her and perhaps he could be moved to a seat in the front of the room?", "NTA. And nicer than I would have been, perhaps. I'd have just given him wrong answers if he kept bothering me", "NTA - But don't let him copy any of your work again, if he fails the class it's on him.", "NTA, you should just speak to him *in front of the teacher* and lay it out for *both* of them.\n\n \"I'm sorry, Moham, but I really need to concentrate on *my own* work. You ask me 'what are we doing?' multiple times during *every* class, and I'm not going to indulge you anymore. You need to learn to focus in class, and if you need help with that, you need to talk to your teachers, not other students.\"", "NTA for not wanting to help but definitely the AH for how you responded- why not try and talk to him nicely about how you feel first? I get that being a sophomore in high school, effective communication of your boundaries is something you\u2019re actively learning. You can always try to say something like \u2018hey, I just wanted to let you know that even though I wish I could help you all the time it kind of stresses me out to always have to keep tabs for both of us. If you\u2019re ever really really stuck, I\u2019ll try and help, but for the most part I need this time to focus or I\u2019ll fall behind\u2019 kids like that are often aware of their disability and already feel bad about themselves. You can have a firm boundary and also not contribute to his low self esteem. I think it\u2019s also probably useful to mention that you\u2019ll be dealing with people at different levels than you for the rest of your life and that might be something you want to develop patience for. You\u2019re not gonna get anywhere by being straight up mean to people the first time you ever express discontent with the way people relate to you. You can\u2019t be mad at someone if they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re upsetting you. You did very obviously hurt his feelings and publicly humiliate him. Tbh I would apologize and politely (without condescension) explain the boundary.", "NTA, and stop answering his stupid questions. He is using you as a crutch for his own laziness and inattention.

I was that kid in school, I have hearing loss and could never follow what was going on in the classroom. It\u2019s not your responsibility to help other students keep up, but that kid did not deserve the embarrassment you caused him.\n\nThings like this, it\u2019s ok to have a conversation or talk to the teacher so they can figure out what the kid needs. The education system isn\u2019t perfect, but going around shaming your peers for not being able to keep up serves no one.", "They did this to me in school, but for hyper-active students.  I was calming.  The    emotional energy used was draining.

Teachers wouldnt do jack shit, just make them leave class and that was it, the punishment was skipping class and still getting attendance. It was fucking obvious what the solution should have been (separate them and make them go to different classrooms, take points off their grades, suspension) but no one did anything, in fact I was usually the one going to the principla bc i had a very obvious reaction to being constantly bothered by these little fuckers", "I drive a school bus, and while it's not a classroom, I do decide where kids get to sit. I generally try to have kids sit with friends/ someone they do well with. But some kids don't get to do that, because then they create problems (feedback loop of bad behavior, egging each other on). But there are only so many seats. So what happens? Sometimes a \"problem\" student gets sat next to a great/quiet one. For me, I'm not asking the quiet student to police the loud one; I just don't want the loud one getting worse, and again, there's only so many seats.", "As educator, a combination of the above springs to mind", "To all the people making posts stating with \n \n>To all the people\n \nGet over yourselves.\n \nYes this includes me, but I know I'm a narcissist.", "Being well behaved and \"gifted\" I was usually made to sit next to a disruptive boy in the class, I guess with the assumption that I would help them. I hated it, if anything it just dragged me down. I just wanted to learn, not be an unpaid TA. It wasn't just me, I've seen time and again girls get essentially forced to be caretakers for boys who should know better or should be receiving 1-1 support from adults. It just teaches girls from childhood that they are supposed to look after boys and be \"responsible\" while the boys do whatever they want. \n\nOf course my own ADHD went completely undetected until adulthood, because I was a girl and smart and not a problem for teachers. So I was a disabled kid being forced to take on the burden of assisting other likely disabled kids, instead of receiving any support myself.", "Even if a disability is present he interrupts/to doesn't allow op to learn which is not okay.

One of them was deaf in one ear and was too ashamed to wear a hearing aid.  \n\nI wonder if Moham has hearing loss or struggles with English, and he was placed in the class incorrectly.\n\nI hope OP reads your comment and decides to talk to the teacher about Moham.   A condition he has might have fallen through the cracks.", ">It's not on Op to \"keep balance\" or help educate her peers. They're also a STUDENT also receiving instruction.  \n>  \n>It's their job to learn, not be a good influence or be surrogate teacher.\n\nSpeaking as one of the people who was expected to help other kids, I found that setting a hard boundary helped significantly.  If you listen to the teacher and you're still struggling, I'll help you.  If you don't, my answer will be \"Ask the teacher\".  If you ask me again, I'll ask the teacher for you - \"Miss, \\[name\\] over here wasn't paying attention, can you please go over the instructions again for them?\".\n\nI also learned quite quicly that the best way to learn is to teach.  It might be annoying or feel disruptive to your education to always be explaining things to other students, but it's not.  It's actually more helpful to you than it is to them.  Whenever I tutored, I would use this tactic on my students.  Make them teach me the lesson and then make corrections if necessary when they were done.\n\nObviously this specific situation leans more to the first solution though.", "I feel for Moham in this situation, because I was also one of those kids who never knew what was going on in class and OP's comment is something you hear over and over and over and *over* again from *everyone* and it wears you down. He might not know why he's so spacy, but I'd bet this is something he was ashamed of well before this incident. \n\nI don't blame OP for snapping, though, and I don't think teacher's relying on students to be a \"good influence\" helps anyone. It's not helping Moham with whatever underlying issue he has, and it's harmful for students like OP who wanna learn.", "That was my point.", "Not responsible for carrying him but definitely responsible for how mean they were when responding", "Wow, so sorry you experienced that.  I\u2019m a mom if a disabled daughter myself.  She used arm crutches to walk. In kindergarten I found out from the bus driver that they assigned a first grader to meet her off the bus.  When it was rainy she went down like Bambi on ice on the tiles.  The school kept putting off her IEP. (Individual educational plan). All disabled. Children are supposed to have one in the US.  Schools get extra funding though tax\u2019s.  They by law need to meet each individual\u2019s needs.  Many schools aren\u2019t anywhere near prepared.  The superintendent and school are responsible and the parent to provide information.  No child should Ever be put in the position you were.

It's also not likely to be taken well if OP were to give advice such as getting tested for ADHD or similar, so I don't feel comfortable recommending that course of action.\n\nUltimately it's something for the teacher to handle, and it would probably be best if OP went to the teacher to try and resolve these situations in the future.
