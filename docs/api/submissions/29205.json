What he always does is ask me \"what are we doing.\" Now I typically don't mind when other students asks me, i get it, sometimes we zone out and don't pay attention and have to ask for help, it happens to me too. But what I don't do is ask 2-5 times a class. At the beginning of class the teacher will be explaing something like \"Okay so as you can see there is a sheet on your desk. Answer part I, we'll go over it in 4 minutes.\" Now, after maybe 30 seconds Moham will always ask me \"what are we doing?\" like... bro. She literally just told us, did you even read the paper? It has directions on it as well. If this was a one off thing or once in a week thing it defitnetly won't bother me but he does this many times a class.\n\nSo yesterday was pretty much just another day, we were in class, the teacher said the instructions, they were on the sheet, they were on the smartboard as well im pretty sure. And ofcource, Moham asked me \"what are we doing.\" So i told him: read the instructions, answer the questions. There were 2 questions asking for the directions of two words, \"fair\" and \"it\". We had dictionarys on our desk so we open the dictionary and wrote down the definition. 3 minutes pass and the teacher is going over the question, \"so what is the third definition of 'fair'? That's right blahblah..\" then Moham asks me again **while** she's talking. \"What is the definition of fair?\" I look at his paper, he has nothing written down for either question. I tell him she's literally going over it right now, he later proceeds to ask me again for the definition of 'it'. Literally what is wrong with your ears? I just turned my sheet over to him and let him copy. \n\nBy the end of class the teacher told us to read pages 11-17 and finish part 3 and 4 (the rest of the worksheet) for homework. Moham asks me what are we doing. I tell him to read pages 11-17 for homework and complete the rest of the worksheet. I then tell him to pay more attention during class because its really annoying being constantly asked what's going on. He then starts arguing back with me like wtf? He's saying stuff like its hard to follow along. At this point I was really annoyed and said in a assertive voice so the class could hear rather easily, something along the lines of \n\n\"omg, how the hell did you get into honors English? You really can't listen to a thing the teacher says. Do you not have any shame asking me what;s going on 10 times a day? She just said what's for homework.\" \n\nThe classroom was rather silent and Moham looked at me with a look in his eyes, I just looked away and started putting my binder and pen away. The teacher broke the silence and repeated what to do for homework before the bell rang. I talked about it to my friend at lunch today as a funny story but he said that I was kinda being a dick, calling him out infront of the entire class. He didn't show up today\n\nSo AITA\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1697674231, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17b5j1z/aita_for_embarrasing_an_annoying_student_that/", "score": 775, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I called out and embarresed him infront of the class. My friend told me that even though he was annoying, I should've just ignored or put up with him because he was a very antisocial and introverted student who would probably die from the embarresment (He was in our class in our freshman year so we know him a little). I was very annoyed as I believe i'm pretty much a saint for putting up with him for so long and still answering his questions. My friend says I should've just ignored him so he gets the hint and stops asking me if I was annoyed. He didn't show up to class today which may just be a coincidence but if what I did made him too scared to go to school I honestly feel he's way too fragile.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Fortunately, I never made it anyone else's problem because I also had crippling social anxiety so I just suffered my confusion in silence lol. But I've *also* been the \"'mature' girl who gets paired up with needy boys and expected to meet their needs\" (because the ADHD didn't get in the way of me being considered \"mature\" since I masked so well).

Also there is a measurable, very **real** pedagogical value for those who perform well in being asked to help mentor those who don't.

That's *a well attested to fact*.\n\nSo while there's definitely room here to say this has gone on too long, has gone far enough for OP - it's just not true to suggest the this is diminishing OP's education in and of itself.

The boys were each allowed to read the same poem from a chicken soup for the soul book.\n\nI sat with 3 boys in science class. Sub gave me detention because they were talking and I was reading the science book and taking notes. Even after the boys admitted they were the ones talking, she said I could have prevented it by stopping them by paying better attention.\n\nOn group projects, us girls were held to a different standard than boys and often encouraged to do most of the work since they knew certain boys wouldn\u2019t do any work.\n\nEven in band, the directors told me to set the example for the boys on the drumline as one of the few girls on it. If they screwed up, us girls were the ones approached and told to knock it off. One obnoxious jerk once removed my uniform and sticks off the truck and when I complained, I was told to be a better team player and work with him more on his attitude.\n\nAnd this wasn\u2019t just happening to me, most of the girls in class went through things like this as well.

Thankfully my teacher eventually realized it wasn't fair to me and stopped doing it, and apologized to me. But yeah it shouldn't have been an issue in the first place because he should have had an actual professional with him to support him.\n\nReally, he shouldn't have been in that class in the first place.
