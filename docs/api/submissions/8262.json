My girlfriend (29) was going to be my (30 male) plus one. My girlfriend loves to dress up and wear short dresses and I love that and as long as she is comfortable I'm cool with anything.\n\nHowever, my boss and his wife are very conservative. In the invitation, they asked for all men to wear black suits and the women to wear a long dress with long sleeves and no dramatic makeup. I talked about it with my girlfriend saying that it is okay if she doesn\u2019t come but as it is my boss I must go. She told me it was fine and she doesn\u2019t mind wearing a long dress and no heavy makeup. \n\nI was so happy we both looked for dresses online and I bought them.  Yesterday when I went to pick her up she was wearing the exact opposite of the dress code. She wore a short dress and dramatic makeup. Whilst she looked gorgeous ( i told her so ) I asked what happened to the other dress that she was going to wear. She said that it's unreasonable and misogynistic for dictating what women should wear. I told her that it's the bride's wish and we should not disrespect it on her wedding day I asked you about this and you said you didn\u2019t mind. And we are not leaving until she changes. She got mad and got down of the car saying she will not attend a misogynist wedding. I said fine and drove off.\n\nNow she is not answering her phone and her friends are calling me a sexist and cruel man.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674675341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l7ga2/aita_for_going_to_a_wedding_after_leaving_my_gf/", "score": 233, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially not weddings for people you don't know. And while I'm 100% \"don't police what women wear\", the reality is that we live in a society where we are judged in certain circles by what we wear, whether it's good or not, and if we want our partners to be able to succeed, sometimes we have to help them perform the theatrics of living in that society. I wear whatever I want 99% of the time, but if we're having dinner with my husband's 60 year old trad boomer bosses who determine his promotions and raises, I'm in my sorority girl best, not my ripped jeans and band tshirts normal self. \n\nI'd honestly examine my relationship if this is how she tries to manipulate you into getting her way, even at the expense of your career.", "NTA...You gave her the option of not attending from the very beginning.

Certain religions would probably dictate the covering of arms and legs.  And over the top makeup would be considered disrespectful.

I assume you\u2019re not really in a position to jeopardize your job by 1) not going to the wedding in protest with her or 2) bringing her against dress code. So I\u2019d approach it that way.

Their beliefs only impact me if I CHOOSE to go. You have decided to go, great. Your girlfriend said she was fine with this dress code, until she wasn't, not great. These people aren't forcing their beliefs on anyone, just asking that they be respected in their own personal space, and a long dress and simple makeup is pretty easy to attain and is in no way demeaning. \n\nYour girlfriend also should have respected you enough to tell you before the wedding if she disagreed. I try not to make assumptions beyond the story told, but honestly, it feels like your girlfriend doesn't actually care about the beliefs, but was hoping to cause a scene/get attention at the wedding by being dressed like this.

It is, also, within your right to go to your boss' wedding. So long as you are being clear that you strongly disagree with that misogynistic nonsense, I think it's OK. Your GF is allowed to be upset I think, but you're also allowed to go to the wedding.\n\nEDIT: Changed from NAH to NTA because I didn't read carefully the part where it said your GF agreed to the rules ahead of time.\n\nIf she agreed to the rules after you made it clear that's what they wanted, then no, she doesn't have a right to be upset. You gave her advance warning, and explained the situation. I think you are justified. I don't think she's allowed to be upset with you personally. With the misogyny of your boss? Sure. But not you.

My girlfriend (29) was going to be my (30 male) plus one. My girlfriend loves to dress up and wear short dresses and I love that and as long as she is comfortable I'm cool with anything.\n\nHowever, my boss and his wife are very conservative. In the invitation, they asked for all men to wear black suits and the women to wear a long dress with long sleeves and no dramatic makeup. I talked about it with my girlfriend saying that it is okay if she doesn\u2019t come but as it is my boss I must go. She told me it was fine and she doesn\u2019t mind wearing a long dress and no heavy makeup. \n\nI was so happy we both looked for dresses online and I bought them.  Yesterday when I went to pick her up she was wearing the exact opposite of the dress code. She wore a short dress and dramatic makeup. Whilst she looked gorgeous ( i told her so ) I asked what happened to the other dress that she was going to wear. She said that it's unreasonable and misogynistic for dictating what women should wear. I told her that it's the bride's wish and we should not disrespect it on her wedding day I asked you about this and you said you didn\u2019t mind. And we are not leaving until she changes. She got mad and got down of the car saying she will not attend a misogynist wedding. I said fine and drove off.\n\nNow she is not answering her phone and her friends are calling me a sexist and cruel man.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Uhm NTA...she's sooooo wrong here.\nYou told her and she was oke until probably people started whispering in her ear. ( I hope thats te case and not that it's her character)\nYou were right to go without her...the bride and groom wishes are to be fulfilled or you should stay away if you aren't willing to do so.\nYou gave her the option and she was oke with it. \nYou can't show up of people won't want it.", "NTA.  If she didn\u2019t like the wedding requirements, she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to go.  Instead of doing what was asked, she tried to defy the request and make the event about her instead of the bride and groom.  This is not about misogyny. It\u2019s nothing more than a childish plea for attention and a big red flag.  You\u2019re better off.", "Run. This is not the type of woman you want to be tied to. It was a dress code for both men and women and is about respect to the couple getting married. She's being disgusting in her lack of respect. In my personal opion short short dresses are never appropriate at a formal event. I'd have left her as well. She's acting like a child throwing a tantrum. NTA", "NTA and it\u2019s not misogyny to want a very specific dress code. It sounds like she cares more about her appearance then about your relationship with your boss at your job. I would break up with her and tell her that you want a partner that respects other people\u2019s boundaries vs someone who only cares about herself.", "NTA you're not sexist. You didn't do anything sexist in what you described, at least. You don't try to dictate what she wears, this was someone else picking a dress code for their wedding. \n\nAnd it's not a friend or relative's wedding either, it's your boss. It's perfectly normal and should be kind of obvious that you want to stay on good terms with your boss and not, you know, risk having a shitty work environment or get fired lol \n\nWe all - well most of us - have at some point in our work life pulled ourselves together and nodded or smiled at something our boss said that we don't agree with in our private life. \n\nAnd this isn't really your boss saying or doing something out there, this is them wanting a dress code on their wedding, they didn't go out there saying they judge people for what they chose to wear on any other day. That's a perfectly normal thing to do.\n\nYour gf is a huge AH in this situation. Did she want you to get in trouble at work? did she want your boss and boss's new wife to be upset at you? What was she expecting? \n\nShe could've said that she wouldn't go, instead she told you she was fine with the dress code then sprung it on you last minute so you didn't have time to argue.", "NTA. Your gf doesn't know what misogyny is..... and she's kind of an ahole.", "NTA. I agree with your girlfriends POV as if I was forced into a dress code I was uncomfortable with, I would just not attend the event out of principle. She easily could have done the same.", "People saying the dress code is gross and weird.\n\nno people it's normal\nThey pay a lot of money so that THEY have the wedding of their dreams.\nFor that dream to come true they have a vision and they ask if their guest will comply by asking for a longsleeve dress and black suit.\n\nI asked for cocktail/ gala and NO jeans on my wedding.\nIm in a country where people go to weddings and funerals in casual clothing and i think thats not done.\n\nThe only time in my country where to dress up is to a wedding.  \nIf you don't want to comply stay away.", "Nta lots of wedding have dress codes.  If she didn't want to conform to it, then she doesn't have to go.", "NTA. Had you taken her, it very well could have been seen as an attempt to upstage the bride. (Especially since the bride is concerned enough to set a dress code on make up as well as very formal attire) Your boss and his new wife would likely have taken this personally and it could have caused you trouble at work.", "I think you handled it perfectly. Driving away from her and going to the wedding that she herself decided she didn't want to go to.\n\nIf anything she should apologize to you for playing games and wasting your time on that day.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you are most likely single. She agreed, and then decided differently.", "Nta. Its not her wedding and she was given a dress code .", "NTA", "What misogyny? She doesn\u2019t know who dictated that rule? Maybe the bride doesn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s a&& hanging out at her wedding. NTA. Your GF sounds self centered.", "NTA. Is it kinda misogynistic they wish to control how the women dress? Well yes. But it's their wedding, not hers, and they can make such requests if they wish. Plus it's your boss, it's better for work relations that she follows the rules for that day.", "NTA\n\nBUT PLEASE!!! Notice the RED FLAGS she showed to you... what she did wasnt right...\n\nShe pretended to be ok, later she tried to manipulate you into being ok with something that wasnt and Last she blamed you for her wrong decisions...\n\nThat doesnt sounds like a girlfriend or wife material to me...", "NTA but your GF is, break up with her before she does more damage to you or your career", "NTA.\n\n> . She said that it's unreasonable and misogynistic for dictating what women should wear.\n\nAnd she'd have a point if men were allowed to wear whatever they wanted while women were consigned to burlap sacks.\n\nBut that wasn't what happened; there was a perfectly standard 'formal' dress code.\n\nI'd strongly suggest you consider if you want to continue dating a woman that would lie to your face, which she did by agreeing to the dress code, then attempting to circumvent it.  If you want to continue dating a woman that will use social events as, well, relationship dares.  That will weaponize partnership by putting you on the spot like that, then have her friends attack you when you dare to not capitulate immediately.", "NTA.  You weren't making her attend the wedding, and she's actually a pretty big AH here for having you buy a dress for her and then not wearing it.  I wouldn't be surprised if she had planned this all along.", "NTA - There was a dress code, and she agreed to follow it and then changed her mind without speaking to you about it.  The makeup part is a tad weird, but I kind of get it.", "Was the dress code ridiculous in my opinion?\n\nSure\n\nWas is misogyny?  No.  The dress code was dictated by the bride to be and most likely influenced by their conservative/religious values.\n\nWas your girlfriend's actions ridiculous in my opinion?\n\nAbsolutely\n\nWas getting her friends to text you and call you out super immature and a clear red flag?\n\n100%\n\n\n\nThis is your career.  \n\nyour girlfriend...for one day...could not put her own feelings aside so as to make sure you can continue to advance in your chosen career path\n\nAnd at the end of the day...Wearing a conservative dress vs a non conservative dress is not a big ask.  \n\nWith all due respect man....this girl is not marriage material\n\nStop investing your time into someone who only cares about themselves.  At the end of the day, she is always going to put herself first and she just proved that to you\n\nNTA\n\nPS:  Send her a link to this post.  She needs a reality check", "NTA - weddings often require certain attire, that is why they are typically known as black tie events... if your gf wore a white dress (regardless of the length) that would also be a faux-pas revolving around gender norms. Not everything needs to be a statement, especially if your partners career hangs in the balance.", "NTA. She is manipulating you,  huge red flag, do not ignore it.", "NTA. It's not her wedding. Instructions for *guests* were clear. If you don't like the instructions don't go.", "NTA. She is perfectly within her rights to choose what she wants to wear, and if she found the wedding attire unacceptable, she can choose to not attend, as you offered. What she doesn't get to do is show up at the wedding of YOUR BOSS, and make a statement about her opinion of the dress code. This isn't about misogyny, it's about making a scene. Feel free to abandon attempts at getting her to answer the phone. And who are these friends that always come out in droves to yell at the significant other?! My friends all just talk shit in the group chat, where it belongs.", "NTA. That was the dress code, if she isn\u2019t going to abide by it then she doesn\u2019t go, and if she does then she\u2019s an AH. The wedding isn\u2019t hers, it\u2019s not her call to make on what other people say the dress code is.", "NTA\n\nLOL, in five years she will probably plan her own wedding and be like: all thin guests have to wear orange and camouflage, all the fat ones black. \n\nBridezilla Joke aside, a dress code is a dress code. She should have said no when she learned about it.", "NTA. She tried to pull a bait and switch on you after she already agreed to the dress code and got an appropriate outfit.\n\nIt sounds like the bride and groom implemented a formal White Tie type of dress code, which traditionally includes floor length gowns and gloves for women and formal suits and or full dress uniforms for men/service women. Not everyone's cup of tea and definitely rooted in some weird old fashioned gender stuff but then she just has the option of not participating if she doesn't agree so", "NTA. It\u2019s really nasty and manipulative of her to agree and even choose a dress etc. then try and force it on you last minute. \nHer friends were probably fed a warped version of the story too.", "So the dress code was formal?\n\nThis has nothing to do with gender. All guests were expected to adhere to a dress code. NTA.", "NTA It is a dress code for an event. She was immature. She could of made your boss very annoyed with you too. I do not think she is your one. She also manipulated you by letting you buy a dress and agreeing to go along with it, then doing bait and switch at the last minute.", "Nta and not getting to be the center of attention is not misogyny. However since that's the default setting on your model good luck in the future.", "NTA\n\nShe was acting like a child. Amy event, work or otherwise, has a dress code or attire. For this wedding, that was not about her, they chose the attire. She was welcome to not attend.", "NTA.  It's not her wedding PERIOD. She initially said she was willing to compromise but ended up chanelling her \"main character\" energy.", "NTA. So many wedding attendees have the mistaken belief that the weddings they attend are about them. She should be making her political statement someplace other than any wedding, much less her partner\u2019s boss\u2019s wedding. You might be too mature for your girlfriend.", "She knew what she was doing. Send her off to the streets, she is dangerous. I bet she is one of those who mostly listen to what their girl friends are telling them. \n\nNo respect and i am really tired of that mentality nowadays; \u201ci can do whatever the hell i want\u201d bla bla bla. Have some dignity and respect for other people\u2019s choices and live your own life as you want. \n\nNTA but your gf is the AH", "NTA - run, kind sir, run far far away.  You gave her a heads up and she agreed with it.  You even bought her a dress!  For her to do this is such selfish and entitled behavior.  Let alone the fact that you are already going to look bad to your boss for RSVPing for 2 and only showing up as 1.\n\nAlso, **both** men and women were requested to dress a certain way so the misogynistic comment is a bit of a stretch.", "NTA. She lied and said she was fine with it, and even let you buy her a new dress for it! Glad you went without her and didn't let her cause the scene she was trying to pull!", "That was a power play in the relationship. She knew what the dress code was.", "NTA. While I think their dress code was a bit ridiculous, it\u2019s still their right to make it a requirement. Plus, this is your BOSS. The person whose emotions very much affect you continuing to get paid. Making a stand over something this petty is just plain *dumb*. \n\nYour girlfriend is being ridiculous and childish. This behavior is for edgy 14 year olds who don\u2019t know any better. Not a grown ass adult on the edge of 30.", "NTA. It is perfectly normal having dresscodes in weddings. Everyone here calling this mysoginist need to cool down. With dresscodes, both genders need to dress up in a specific way. And it\u2019s not uncommon to ask female guests to go easy on the make up. Out of respect for the bride, this should be done without being said. Your NOT supposed to outshine the bride with your dramatic red lipstick, massive fake lashes or other dramatic make up. Stop calling everything mysoginist. A wedding is about the bride and groom, not us guests wearing dramatic make up and dress as we want to\n\nYour girlfriend is AH here and if I was A bride and asked for a certain dresscode while she showed up in what you describe, I would drag her out of my wedding. Your bosses wedding was not about her", "I swear I've read this before but from the woman's perspective. NTA. There was a dress code and she said she was ok with it", "NTA - She was well aware of the dress code far in advance. If she had an issue with it, she never should have agreed to go in the first place.", " NTA, massive red flag", "On no! The consequences of her actions! \n\n\u2026anyways \n\nNTA", "NTA, and what she did was wrong. She's not wrong about the dress code being misogynistic, but she shouldn't have fine that to you.", "And after agreeing to the conditions and OP buying her a new dress.", "It's also manipulative by trying to link it back to something harmful, which it isn't. Thinking these types of dress codes are \"sexist\" is just wrong (if anything it's enforcing gender stereotypes, what if a man wanted to wear a dress or a woman a suit?).", "THIS \u261d\ufe0fshe's showed you her true nature. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nGood on you for not caving, OP.", "Seriously, had to scroll too far for this one, all other issues are secondary in my mind to this. She agreed upfront to the conditions but then showed up doing the opposite without consulting. The plan was clearly for you to along with it because it was the last second.", "And took his money for a new dress.", "Gotta admit, my dictionary didn't have this meaning either...\n\n> Misogyny: following the bride's wishes.", "Telling people what make up to wear as *guests* of a wedding strikes me as misogynistic. \n\nBut, since the GF agreed to the wedding dress code in advance, even got BF to buy a dress that would work, then blindsided him right before the wedding in a way that could hurt his current employment, NTA.", "The dress code is absolutely rooted in misogyny. While yes the guys were \u201ctold how to dress\u201d, they were told to wear what they would almost certainly wear to a wedding anyway. They basically had one rule (wear black) although you could maybe count it as two rules if you think wearing a suit is a rule. The women had 3 rules (4 if you count wearing a dress as a rule), including rules about their makeup. \n\nHowever, at an event like this the choice is go and wear what you\u2019re told, or don\u2019t go. You don\u2019t get to go wearing something different as a protest, especially when she had previously agreed to go.", "But she's woman.", "I agree. She cared more about being the center of attention at someone else\u2019s wedding than what her SO was trying to do which was RESPECT the wishes of his boss and new wife. OP needs to dump this chick fast", "Hopefully, they met someone at the wedding", "I\u2019m politically pretty left of center. But the push to label absolutely everything as sexist, racist, ableist, etc. etc. is turning the political left into a joke. It\u2019s also creating an environment where people stop paying attention and real examples of sexism, racism etc. are overlooked. It\u2019s like car alarms. There\u2019s so many that no cares when one goes off.", "That\u2019s because the men\u2019s dress code is standard \u201cblack tie\u201d wedding dress code. The dress code for women is based on a conservative idea of what is modest and appropriate, not what\u2019s in line with standard black tie dress code for women.", "Considering that she played along, let OP buy her new dresses(plural), and then waits until the literal moment he picks her up to go looking the exact opposite of what was discussed. I'd say she was looking for drama, that's why she waited.", "You wrote great! I understood it all. And you are very correct!", "And it's not like the men's dress code allowed board shorts and Hawaiian shirts for guys. The only times I've worn a suit for a wedding is when I've been part of the wedding.  It's a formal wedding.", "Yep. I've been to formal weddings, I've been to ones where jeans were encouraged, I've been to the Hawaiian shirt and sundress type, 20s theme, costumes. You go with the flow.", "It\u2019s a wedding, it is entirely fine to set a dress code  and not inherently insulting to anybody. People can not attend if they don\u2019t want to adhere to it.", "Could you explain how it\u2019s mysognistic when there is a formal dress code for women AND men?  I\u2019ve never worn a dress, but take my word on it that a black suite can be very uncomfortable, especially if it\u2019s hot. I would be much more comfortable in shorts and short sleeves. But that\u2019s not the dress code. There are significant restrictions on both sexes. \n\nAgree with you - NTA.", "Well, the conservative thing may have been a religious thing.  I work with some Orthodox  Jews, and this would not be uncommon.  You are free to accept or not, but you have to dress conservatively.", "Having a dresscode for a wedding is quite common.\n\nTypically it's at least \"no whites\", but may also ask to do include a certain theme color, or indeed a specific attire.\n\nThis wedding may have had a conservative dresscode, but nothing outrageous. They didn't ask anything overly expensive or otherwise unwearable.\n\nHaving a \"Prada-only\" or \"suits must be leather\" dresscode would've been crazy, but this? No.\n\nOP's GF is crazy for (1) calling this mysogynistic and (2) willing to risk OPs career for this. OP is NTA.", "Yep. If you object to a wedding dress code, your alternative is to not go -- not show up and aggressively flout the dress code. (Especially when it's your boss!)", "The dress code may actually be dictated by the venue rather than the couple in question. \n\nI have attended weddings in churches that required women\u2019s shoulders to be covered and did not allow men to cover their heads. Likewise I have been to a Jewish wedding where women were required to be covered from collarbone to knees and elbows covered while men wore kippas and wore long sleeves and long pants.", "Yes!  I agree that you shouldn\u2019t be able to dictate to a group specifics like makeup or that a formal dress must cover the arms (most do not).  \n\nHowever, her agreeing with it then springing it on OP last minute\u2026 planning to make a scene in front of OP\u2019s boss\u2026 trying to make the event about her when she had the choice not to attend without any negative consequences\u2026 these all make OP NTA at all.  This was a time when she should\u2019ve been supporting you.", "I imagine OP meant something like: \n\n\"I expressed to my girlfriend that I understand if she does not want to attend as my plus one due to the antiquated dress code and I would not hold opting-out against her, but I wouldn't be staying home from the wedding because I feel like attending my boss's wedding is important for my career.\"", "I think for me it veered hard out of NAH when gf decided to be angry about the dress code at the last minute and not answer her phone. It\u2019d be NAH and honestly no conflict if gf just decided not to go, but that\u2019s not everything that happened, ya know?", "I was looking for this comment, have definitely read this set up recently. It also feels like bait", "What\u2019s wrong with using the word patriarchy?", "Hi \nCould you please tell me what about the dress code was silly?", "I wouldn't like a dress code like that either, but she's an AH for buying a dress she had no intention of wearing lying about it until OP went to pick her up, especially because he told her he wouldn't be upset if she didn't want to go because of the dress code.", "Tbh I disagree with this judgement, not because I agree with the dress code but because the GF and her friends aren't calling the boss an asshole, they're calling OP an asshole and acting like OP is misogynistic for expecting the GF to do something she already agreed to do and which is expected of every wedding guest, not just them.", "It\u2019s their wedding. How does the boss suck because they have a dress code at their wedding? Most weddings have a dress code.", "Look. I love dressing up sexy with the sky-high heels. fake lashes and dramatic makeup. But I dress that way because I know how it makes me look and feel as well as for the reactions it elicits. That\u2019s not gonna be a welcome part of the dress code for my wedding, though.\n\nThere\u2019s a time and place to dress for the club; that isn\u2019t it. My wedding is not the event for my bestie to put her new boob job on display or for me to have the edge of my thigh highs peeking out. I\u2019ve got no issues with people whose weddings are free for alls, and I\u2019ve got no issues with weddings where people want them to be beautiful and classy affairs. No one is obligated to come, and if it\u2019s too unbearable for someone to don a long dress and light makeup for the evening, then they\u2019re not worth the space they take up and I\u2019d rather not have them there anyway.", "I'd say it's not to upstaging the bride. The fact that this is considered misogynistic by the GF and patriarchal by you is just ludicrous", "How exactly is a woman telling men what to wear misogynistic?

I shaved it short and was the first time in about 6 years that I had facial features.\n\nDid I have to do it? No, the groom has only known me with a beard. I did it to be presentable on their day.\n\nIt's stupid.

OP himself says his boss and wife are conservative.", "It's quite common to have formal dresscode for weddings. I've been to a couple casual wear whatever ones but most have been very formal where you don't wear short dresses or casual pants/tops.

I haven't been to a ton of weddings, and none of them had a dress code beyond semi casual.\n\nI have seen a lot of posts about weddings on here, though, and as best as I can recall, people usually start calling the bride/groom the asshole when they start trying to enforce what everyone wears, vs just the wedding party.", "Dress codes are common sure, but when you start getting into dictating the type of garment along gender lines - you start treading into sexism territory.
