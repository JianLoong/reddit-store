I'm his sole parent because his mother lost the custody battle. \n\nHis school was made aware of this when I removed his mother's details from their system and his current teacher for grade one has not met my ex. Due to the nature of the custody battle, his teacher does know about my ex for safety reasons as she has been barred from coming to the school to get him. Basically, she knows that if she ever sees me with a woman, it is definitely **not** my ex.\n\nHis school has parent teacher meetings twice a year, once before the Christmas break and another at the end of the academic year. \n\nI've been dating my girlfriend, Venus (24F) for the past eight months and she has an amazing relationship with my son. He likes her a lot and he asked me if she could come with me to the parent teacher conference because he wanted her to hear that he's doing well at school. My son used to struggle with English as his mother tongue is Spanish. My Spanish is okay but Venus is fluent, so she helped him improve his English speaking by tutoring him. \n\n\nAt the meeting, I noticed that the teacher was only speaking to Venus. She was making eye contact with her and only directing conversations to her. I found this annoying because although I know most primary parents are women, the teacher is well aware that I'm Nathan's sole parent. Venus kept redirecting the conversation to me and I did ask a few questions but the teacher would speak to me for a few seconds, and then go back to speaking to Venus only. Eventually, I said 'im sorry to interrupt you but I'm Nathan's father and I'd appreciate it if you spoke to me'. \n\nThe teacher seemed taken back and irritated but she apologized and spoke to me for the rest of the meeting.\n\n\nI told my brother in law (sister's husband) about what happened and he thinks I overreacted. He said that while he does find it annoying when teacher only speak to my sister at meetings, he understands that it's not out of malice and just a force of habit since mothers tend to be more involved than fathers. He also said it was my fault for bringing Venus along to the meeting. He thinks it was an asshole move for me to interrupt the teacher and make her feel like she did something wrong for something that was most likely not malicious.\n\nIt was brought up again at Christmas because Venus spent it with my family and my mother asked Venus if she had Nathan's inhaler and my BIL interrupted and said 'Careful, (my mom's name), Mark (me) might freak now'. \n\nI would like to put this situation to rest.

You weren't rude, you gave a gentle reminder. \"Venus\" is not your new wife and she may not always be in you and your son's lives. A teacher should speak to the legal parent/guardian directly. Good on \"Venus\" for having your back during the conference and I hope you all have many wonderful years ahead.", "NTA. It probably wasn't malicious on the teacher's part but you were still right to correct the behavior. You weren't a dick about it. No hard feelings. End of family discussion.", "NTA  your BIL is making something out of nothing here.  I mean I'm sure it's just some sort of force of habit for the teacher but you corrected her rightly and she talked to you after that.", "NTA. She's not his mom, she's not even his stepmom. You've been dating her for 8 months, that's not very long at all and any questions should be directed towards you.", "NTA.  If you are the one who asked the question then the answer should have been addressed to you.  That goes in any setting.", "Your BIL is being an asshole. Maybe the best way to address it with the teacher would be when your girlfriend and son are not present, although that was probably not an option. \nI was the Dad who would correct people if they said I was \"babysitting\" my son. \"No, he's my son. I am parenting.\"", ">'im sorry to interrupt you but I'm Nathan's father and I'd appreciate it if you spoke to me'. \n\nIf these are the words you said you are totally NTA. You were polite, and clear, and your request was reasonable. Maybe the teacher has an issue with making eye contact with men or something but she has to get over that since in general half of the parents she will be dealing with are men. Objectively your girlfriend shouldn't have been there if she isn't a parent to your child, but you son wanted her there so I wouldn't expect you to say no to that.", "You're NTA. It's great that Nathan and Venus get along, but his teacher knows that venus is not his mother. It's inappropriate and disrespectful, especially after she tried correcting the teacher herself. It sounds like your brother needs to grow up, honestly.", "NTA. You asked the teacher to speak with you concerning your child. You didn't overreact.", "NTA. This happens way too much with PTCs where the teacher will only talk to the mother. I've had a few of my kids teachers try to include me and every now and then would look my way, but the one who did it the best was the one male teacher they had (small school, my kids pretty much all had the same teachers). It needs to be more normalized that fathers are parents too and want to be included.", "NTA.  It may be habit on the teacher's part. She may be accustomed to mothers being more interactive with her. Ideally a teacher should address both parents if they are both there, until it appears one is more involved.  Regardless of the relationship between your gf and your son,  you're a parent and shouldn't be ignored during a parent teacher meeting.", "NTA. Period. \n\nYou're the boys parent, not your girlfriend. You weren't rude, you simply corrected the situation like any parent may in that situation.", "NTA you corrected her not even in a vile way.", "NTA. As much as your son and Venus like each other, you are still his only custodial parent. Even if that wasn't the case and both of you were his parents, it's seriously rude to speak only to one person and basically make the other feel cut out.\n\nWhile I agree that it was likely done unconsciously and thus without malice, it's definitely the right thing to address it to make her aware she's doing it, not just in your case but hopefully makes her more aware in general. You didn't get mad or yell, simply pointed out a behavior that needed to be addressed.", "NTA asking you have the conversation directed at you; cause you're the parent in charge. Having it directed to any other non parental person is just generally rude.", "NTA, but here\u2019s something I know both from my years of parent teacher conferences and working in the schools - teachers often feel VERY anxious at these meetings and don\u2019t enjoy them much. I would give your son\u2019s teacher the benefit of the doubt and consider the fact that she was just nervous and didn\u2019t realize what she was doing. Hopefully in the future this will not be an issue, but I would let it go this time. I was friends with my daughter\u2019s teacher and she still had a panic attack during our conference. As a person who works with kids it\u2019s because that\u2019s the age I work best with, adults intimidate the heck out of me and you come across as a very serious no nonsense person which could make a person even more nervous (not a criticism, just an observation).", "NTA for the teacher conference, but why is your mom assuming that Venus has your kid\u2019s inhaler? I find it strange as she\u2019s only been in your life for eight months why is everyone already putting her in the stepmom\u2019s role? If you\u2019re not thinking about making her your wife soon, I might consider slowing down the pace. Your son and family seem to be confused as to her role.", "NTA. She isn't the parent and the teacher was on the wrong. You weren't rude about it. BIL is unnecessary though.", "NTA. This is like the conversation of a man and woman go to a repair shop, car dealership and they tall to the man only. Some people think it is not a big deal . Some people realize that it is wrong", "NTA. I do all school related paperwork for my daughter, and always have. My wife\u2019s name is listed as secondary contact for all communications.  From the time she was in kindergarten to now, as a junior in high school, my wife has always been the first one contacted by the teacher or school. It\u2019s very frustrating, because my wife has a much higher pressure job than I do, so I have more flexibility to take care of things.", "NTA it's a gender bias and I don't think it was malicious but the teacher shouldn't take it personally because you are the parent. It doesn't sound like you were mean. She shouldn't assume who is the parent.", "NTA\n\nThat was very disrespectful and you politely, firmly corrected her behavior. \n\nSounds like your BIL is being a bit of jerk about it though.", "NTA. My fianc\u00e9 went with me when I sold my car literally just so I\u2019d have a ride home. I bought the car before we met and and everything was solely in my name. Wanna guess who the guy spoke to for most of the time? It\u2019s annoying when people make assumptions like that. I found it insulting that the guy asked me if I was okay with the price and then went to the other man in the room, as if my answer didn\u2019t matter, for confirmation. I can completely understand why this would feel like she\u2019s insulting you as a parent. It\u2019s just like when people talk about fathers \u201cbabysitting\u201d as if they\u2019re less of a parent than the mother. That should not be the norm", "NTA\n\nThe benefits of feminism are that all people get to be freed from gender BS, men included. You are his parent, Venus is not, and you have the right to expect and to ask, if necessary, that you be addressed directly. \n\nPeople are used to women being the primary caretaker. They\u2019re also used to heterosexual couples, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok not to correct oneself and fix it going forward if the teacher says \u201cmom and dad\u201d and it\u2019s actually \u201cdad and pops\u201d.", "NTA. Activists call this a micro-agression.", "NTA and this is for one simple reason as you are his father with sole custody and therefore parental rights and responsibility. Your gf does not have these and can not sign any forms etc on your sons behalf. Therefore the teacher should have been directing the conversation primarily to you as you mentioned.", "Nta, I dont think you did anything wrong at all. You directed it very politely\u2026 your bil tho is being an asshole.\n\nIt is great that venus cares for your son too , so if you intend to have a long relationship with her, then I would still include her in all aspects of parenting if she wants to\u2026", "NTA - Nope, the teacher knows the situation quite clearly, so I\u2019m baffled.\n\nEven if she didn\u2019t know you, it would still be gender bias to direct the majority of the conversation to the female partner.\n\nBut she does know you and your situation, which just makes this very odd.", "NTA, you weren't overreacting you were making it clear that since you're his parent you want to be the one she's speaking to, nof your gf. The same principle applies when a woman and her male partner go to a dealership and the salesperson only talks to the guy.", "NTA\nIn my experience, primary school teachers are great perpetrators of rigid gender ideas.", "That crack your brother-in-law made at Christmas was completely unnecessary. Your brother sounds like a jerk for holding onto something and bring it up long after the fact.", "NTA, you were polite and to the point. \n\nI bet she didn't love that interaction, but most people don't like when they receive feedback on their rude behavior.", "NTA for correcting the teacher. She needed correction. Fathers are often disregarded, and teachers who do so are in the wrong. \n\nI do question bringing an 8 mos girlfriend to parent teacher conference. She is not a parent, even if she may be one day.", "NTA. I've had the opposite experience before. My husband is an immigrant and so when we would get parts for his truck he would have me talk to the people at the store. Every damn time they'd start tlaking to him and he'd have to direct it back to me. It was extremely annoying. Your case is so much more important than mine though since it involves your child. Teachers should be the first people to actively work against stereotyping parents", "NTA.  I'm glad your gf and son get along so well and I'm glad he's doing well in school.  His teacher needs some remedial lessons.  Good on you for being as restrained as you were by the teacher's disrespect.  She knew beforehand and still ignored you as the parent.  (And Venus sounds like a keeper!)", "NTA. You weren't a dick about it and it is a common mistake in these types of situations since so many dads are so checked out. It's weird that your family is giving you crap about it.", "NTA- I am a teacher. I would never direct student information to someone other than the parent/guardian. Even when a parent comes with a translator, I make eye contact with, and speak to, the parent.\n\nIf a student comes with both parents, I make sure to address each parent and keep my eye contact moving to both.", "NTA although did you consider that because you introduced her as your girlfriend when you sat down and given she knows the situation with your ex she was perhaps trying to make your girlfriend included in the meeting? It also seems like Venus has been very active in your sons life so he probably talks about her all the time in class. I think perhaps you were a little harsh in the grand scheme of things.", "NTA it's the teacher fault even if she is used to more talk to mothers doesn't mean everybody are like that!", "The teacher was unprofessional and out of line, you did absolutely nothing wrong. NTA.", "NTA, but BIL is", "NTA, you asked politely if she could speak to you. Even though a teacher might naturally tend to speak to a woman, that\u2019s not an accurate assumption to make or ideal way to handle it.

I've had to do this as a young person and as a woman.  It happens somtimes to men too I guess!  It's not a person being malicious - so please speak to me because (per my example I am the patient)\n\nIf she thinks she did something wrong that's on her.\n\nNTA.  And by that I mean their reaction, even if they think you were in the wrong, is very like asshole behaviour.", "NTA and your BIL is an idiot,\n\nHowever, in regards to the teacher you may want to consider that if your son was excited about the girlfriend being there, he may have bragged to the teacher about it. That might be part of why she was surprised you had an issue with it as well. If you didn't tell the teacher she was just there to observe especially.", "NTA. She was being sexist.", "NTA\n\nBut it\u2019s really weird for you to bring a gf of less than a year to your child\u2019s conferences. Even though she\u2019s been helping him with language skills.

Sounds like the type to have an opinion on everything.", "NTA - it seems that you put your request in kindly. if she didn\u2019t get the hint from the redirections of Venus, than it\u2019s the \u201cfault\u201d of the teacher that you have to ask to talk to you.", "NTA. I agree with your brother that the teacher wasn't being malicious, but neither were you by correcting her. Sometimes you have to ask for what you need, in this case to be treated as the primary parent that you are.", "NTA. Your BIL is being an ass. \n\nYou were absolutely right in interrupting the teacher and saying what you said. She shouldn't have been annoyed. \n\nWater under the bridge unless there teacher does it again. There's no need for your BIL to be making it into an issue because it isn't.", "INFO: Is it possible that the teacher was just looking to your GF because she knows your GF spends a lot of time supporting your son's learning (i.e., the tutoring). It's highly likely your son has talked about your GF helping him with English and school. This is an incredibly common knowledge in elementary school, which adults at home supports in school work. It's also really common in parent teacher conferences to talk about what students should focus on in learning.\n\nSo, if your teacher knows or believes your GF works with your student regularly on learning, and then you BROUGHT HER (your gf) TO THE CONFERENCE, it's honestly not weird to me that your teacher would naturally gravitate towards talking to her a bit more about his learning (with you sitting there).\n\n(As a sidenote, it's great she helps. It sounds like that's amazing for your son, and a great way for her to bond with him!)", "In parent teacher meeting when both parents are present...teachers tend to gravitate towards who they perceive as the primary care giver.  In most cases the Mom.  So while you pointed this out to his teacher I suspect the teacher simply fell into 'old habits'.

You brought your GF to the parent teacher conference, which inherently implies that she is involved with the child's schooling.

How bizarre of her, knowing your situation.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH but I\u2019m just wondering, if your son said to you that he wanted Venus to know how well he was doing, maybe he had also told his teacher that Venus had been tutoring him and he was excited for her to know he was doing well, so that\u2019s why the teacher directed the comments more to your gf.", "NTA UNLESS you were rude about it. \n\nBeing rude, even when right, makes you an asshole.", "Now you know how every woman who's ever taken her car to be serviced and happened to have her dad/brother/boyfriend/husband/gay best male friend who doesn't even have a drivers license etc feels.   \n\n\nThe teacher has internalized gender roles in her head. They're wrong and they're hurtful to you. You did fine by redirecting her. NTA", "INFO:  I think it\u2019s important to know what she was saying to Venus.

I'm teacher. I might have addressed the girlfriend more too, mostly because even by your admission, she's the one helping your son the most academically.

Bringing up made up scenarios with step parents is irrelevant and actually only strengthens the point of why the teacher is in the wrong", "Is this an English speaking school or a Spanish speaking school?", "This reminds me of when a woman goes to buy a car and has a man with her. In almost every case, the salesperson will speak to the man regardless of being told the woman is the one purchasing the car.

Why bring a new gf and then get mad the teacher is involving her?", "Is it actually 18:1? \n\nI am always skeptical of these \"low ratio\" districts because my province repeats similar statistics, but they got that number by comparing the number of active teaching contracts to the number of students enrolled. Which means this is including admin (who do not have students), teacher librarians (who do not have students), Phys Ed and Arts teachers (who do not have their own classrooms), co-teachers (who share students) and special education teachers (who do primarily pull-out and interventions and are not in the classroom).

Anyway, despite saying SHE was looking for a nice little stereo, sales dude kept directing everything towards me.\n\nfinally came right out and said \"I'm just here for the second opinion, she's the one paying\".\n\nAt which point he started seriously upselling her on stuff, pointing out the prettyfull features of much more expensive units.\n\nThat was when I spoke up, reminded her she didn't need that, and we left with a much cheaper unit.", "That must be so frustrating. The other day I was at a child's birthday party chit chatting with another father. I commented that it must be nice to have a teenage child (big age gap between the two children) to babysit on occasion.

I couldn't believe he could say that to me, the leader of my child's upbringing, with a straight face. He knows my situation, our kids are good friends, but when stereotypes are so embedded that they become disguised as facts, I turn into an exception to the rule. Not one of many like I actually am. Assumed gender roles are so moronic. I hope they continue to dissipate in our children's generation. It all starts at home. On the flip side, have you also had similarly frustrating incidents where your husband is assumed to be the breadwinner?", "Why is no one talking about this more.

Teachers can also be asked if they're ok with going over the cap... and what are they supposed to say \"no, I'm sorry I don't want 22, give it to my colleague who will agree to it and already has 23\"? it's lose lose for teachers and kids", "Yes. That\u2019s my daughter\u2019s classroom size. The official ratio is 15:1 but like you said, in reality it\u2019s a little more so it\u2019s around 17:1-19:1. My daughter\u2019s class is 18:1. It\u2019s one of the reasons we moved to this district.

I didn't even know uranium glass was a thing. Found out that when they had the big drive with the 'radium girls' painting watch and instrument dials in the 1920's and 1930's, since it takes approximately three metric tons of uranium to extract 1 gram of radium, all the waste uranium ended up as uranium glass and [Uranium tile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_tile) so \"some 25% of all houses and apartments constructed\\[where?\\] during that period (circa 1920\u20131940) used bathroom or kitchen tiles that had been glazed with uranium.\"", "My husband collects uranium glass.

Even when you try to make raise your voice about this issues WHAT IS OK there is still a over propotinal abuse against women . It's not like 40/60 . \n\nThe main argument is that men don't report it but even when you make it 20/80 it is still an extreme difference . \n\nPretty much every woman experienced sexual harrasment .\n\nI do see that things are changing and men should talk about their issues . The difference is that women normally don't go to a man centred post and talk about women problem but men do. I heard it many times that men want to make it about them and how mistreated they are.

Women will happily be an ally in THAT battle, I assure you!\n\nKudos for OP for being an involved dad! I see more and more of the 30something men that becomes involved dads and it makes me so very happy.
