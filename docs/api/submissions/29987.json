I wanted a fall wedding-the leaves to be changing andto be cool outside. We chose Nov. With the holidays and whatnot, there were only 2 Saturdays in November that made sense.Fianc\u00e9 chose the 11th, because it's indicative of our dating anniversary. So it was decided, 11/11.  \n I announce the date to my family. My sis became upset.  \n1. Her favorite band sings a song that's called 11:11, so she has it tattooed on her.  \n2. She was engaged to some guy like 15 years ago. They didn't get married, but they were supposed to get married on 11/11 (I had completely forgotten).  \n3. It's a week before her wedding anniversary  \nShe was upset because 11/11 is \"her thing\", and it felt like a slap in the face that I would get married a week before she did, years ago.   \nMy sis and I have a tumultuous relationship. The last fight we got into was at my birthday 2 years ago. We had discussed having a family dinner I ended up inviting some friends. Fianc\u00e9 wanted it to be special and about 10-12 people ended up being there. Sister was pissed because, if she had known there were going to be other people there, she wouldn't have come because she didn't feel well. I told her she was never obligated to come and I didn't think I needed to make her aware of the guest list. Anyway, we ended up not talking for a while but because my sister is stubborn (she has never apologized, doesn't take blame) I eventually just let it go, to appease my mother.   \nSo, when I found out she was pissed about the date i chose for my wedding, I wasn't having it. I worked really hard the last several years to establish boundaries eith family and friends, and to not be steamrolled. I was hurt my sister made my wedding about her.   \nShe told me that I took \"her thing\" and as a result she wasn't going to be in the country for my wedding (she booked a trip). It's now been 10 months. Her and I have had limited interaction. My mom says to start the conversation with my sister and to let things go because \"we all know how your sister can be\". Mom said I should have ASKED my sis first if it was ok to choose that day, and I could have approached the subject delicately. This was mind-blowing to me, because my mother and I have to walk on eggshells with my sister. Over the year they've discussed how I could have done things differently, or why it couldn't have been this day or that day.  \nMy wedding is 2 weeks away and my sis and I haven't talked. I didn't send her an invite bc she has not apologized and already said she wouldn't be going. I see no reason to have to initiate the convo like always,strengthening the pattern of letting her get her way. It has been heartbreaking to not have my sis there for my activities, and it hurts to know that her pride got in the way of spending time with me.

It has a lot of concrete tips.", "Gonna give you shit as well then, here. My birthday is 11/11 since over thirty years, how DARE you using that date. It's mine!\nNo really, your sister should go suck rocks.", "Make sure someone has a picture of her and is watching the doors; I have a feeling that wasn't her latest outburst and that she didn't really go on a vacation. I mean, how could she pass up this unique opportunity to disrupt one of your happiest days?", "Ocean mushrooms?", "How does her now-husband feel that the 15 year ago ex still controls a date, one week before *their own* anniversary? Has anyone asked that spouse?", "You're correct", "Not every country fought, but every country was 100% affected by the outcome\u2026", "It isn't. The day is important to you for your reasons, whatever else it signifies isn't relevant. I'm in the US, does that mean nothing important can ever happen on 9/11? No, of course not. Celebrate your day and don't worry about your sister. You're probably better off without her being there. Happy wedding and good luck with your future.", "Sorry to break it to you, but once its over, you will realize it was. \n\nBut you are still not even acknowledging that the date you chose is not a respectful choice\u2026", "Are those supposed to be eggshells on the book cover?   It kind of looks like blocks of cheese.    Or maybe popcorn.   Now I'm hungry and I blame this book cover.", "Seriously. I think sis just has a severe case of main character-itis and shouldn't be indulged. If she cares more to gatekeep this date than to be there to support her sister (OP) then let her.", "But that doesn't obligate them to have a day of remembrance.", "You must be perpetually single and angry about it if you\u2019re raking OP over the coals about this.", "What's 11/11?", "Unless something is seriously missing  here - including that spouse, a trauma? Otherwise yes.", "Not at all, its just a sign of respect for those who protected a way of life that everyone enjoys now. \n\nJust really sad that the drama sisters over here are arguing to claim a date that has this much significance. Like, are they going to steal christmas next?? Lol", "I can be whatever i want to be, thanks to the sacrifices made by others in years past! Lol", "11/11 = 1.  Boom, roasted!!!", "Rememberance day! Scary to think people dont know what that is\u2026", "World War 1 ended on 11/11/1918\n\nSome countries use the date of 11 November to commemorate those lost and those who fought in the war.\nIt\u2019s not a public holiday or anything in most places.", "In the UK, it's Armistice day. It used to be a day of remembrance for WW1, for which the ceasefire came into effect at 11am, 11.11.1918, but over the years it's become a day of remembrance for all wars and the fallen.", "Go clutch your pearls somewhere else. Yes November 11 is a significant day, but that doesn\u2019t mean everything has to stop just to honor Veterans. Nobody is \u201cstealing\u201d that date from Veterans.  Jeez", "But the point is it doesn't have that much significance to everyone.  The whole world does not revolve around what happened over 100 years ago.  In the US we call it veterans day and for the most part no one really gives a shit.  Memorial day is our big holiday for remembering war dead.  Maybe if they were in the UK or France I could see your argument, maybe, but if the world stopped for every special \"remember the war dead\" day in history we would never be able to do anything.  Shaming someone for having a wedding on a holiday you don't even know if her country celebrates is silly.", "As a combat veteran, I had no idea people couldn't get married on this day.....get out of here with your bullshit.", "Remembrance Day is the British term for the day, so many people wouldn\u2019t know it.   In the US, it\u2019s Veteran\u2019s Day.  But I don\u2019t believe the soldiers fought to make sure that everybody halted their lives on that one day each year in perpetuity.\n\nOP, NTA.  But really, in whose mind would you be?", "They can do whatever they want that day. All i said was they are dumb for fighting over claiming the date, and that their stuff was trivial compared to what the date already signifies.", "Wow, no one can actually read. They can do whatever they want that day. I just pointed out how they are dumb to trying to claim a day as theirs. The shame was towards them being drama queens, which it seems people feel the need to defend\u2026", "A combat veteran wouldnt have to ask what the date means. So you are clearly lying.", "It\u2019s also called Remembrance Day in Canada \n\nIt\u2019s a national Holiday", "YOU JUST TRIED TO CLAIM THAT DAY FOR VETERANS ONLY!", "It was asked so I could see your way of thinking. Clearly you're some fucking weirdo, who probably hasn't enlisted, thinking it's ok to gatekeep a day. Your logic is flawed.", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
