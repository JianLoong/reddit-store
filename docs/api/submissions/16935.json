It's just easier on the relationship. \n\nSigned, a fellow popcorn enjoyer", "NTA. You asked him nicely and set a boundary and he isn't respectful of that. Boundaries don't have to be big things that are relationship altering, yall. It's called having healthy relationships. Just tell him you really savor this moment and look forward to it after a long day, and you cherish his company, but would prefer to have two separate bowls. No biggie.", "NTA - That\u2019s your popcorn, you made it, you don\u2019t have to share.

Why does he expect you to always be the one to put in the effort to make extra? Ugh!", "NTA - it wasn't \\*the\\* reason we divorced, but I swear my spouse wanting 'just a sip' of MY drink that I poured for MYSELF was one of the reasons.\n\nHim: \"Can I have a sip of yours?\"\n\nMe: \"I can make you a glass\"\n\nHim: \"But I just want a sip!\"\n\nMe: \"ok\"\n\nHim: \\*drinks half of it\\*\n\nMe: \\*fuming\\*\n\nSo I started drinking pretty much only iced tea, which I liked and he hated.

I get that you want it all to yourself. However ... *and without the Internet coming after me* ... would it be possible for you to ask him ahead of time if he'd like some and then make enough accordingly? And then you can ask him to make it for y'all next time. Fair? Something to consider? It may be just a tiny issue for y'all right now, but it could hit on the wrong night (e.g. after a bad day) and then you're writing a much more involved AITA etc list here on Reddit.", "I think ESH because you are married, married people share even if it's annoying.

Yet, there he was sharing MY drink.  But what really made me angry was that he bought a 12 pack of beer & I bought a 6-pack of Smirnoff Mango flavored vodka.
