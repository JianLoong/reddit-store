I'm posting from my phone, so please forgive me. \n\nI (38F) have two kids (13M & 13F) with my (38M) husband. We living on a military base, which is admittedly relatively safe but not perfect, in a neighborhood surrounded by woods and water. With the kids being a bit older and the relative safety of the neighborhood, we let our kids explore and play with their friends outside with little to no oversight. \n\nThey're good kids with great grades and never get into trouble, and they always have their phones on them (which I check their location on occasionally so I know where they are.) Yesterday my daughter was with her friend who lived right behind us and walked home around 7pm. At the same time, my son walked home a girl and her little sister (3 blocks away) with his best friend. My daughter is sitting with us in the living room and sees a Snap from my son that he is getting a ride from a police officer. I asked her what she was talking about, and she explains that an officer pulled up to her and her friend asking if they wanted rides. She didn't feel comfortable and said no thank you, but apparently my son and his friends hopped in the car.\n\n I tried to call my son and he didn't answer, so I jumped in the car and went the 3 blocks to the girl's house. By then, the officer was gone, the girls were inside and my son and his friend were on their way back to our block. I made sure the friend got home and told my son not to get into cars with strangers (\"But he's an officer and he gave us candy!\"), especially without letting us know where he is. The whole time I'm speaking, my husband is mocking me. So my kids make jokes too. Both kids finally said they knew better and wouldn't do it again, but their dad and I got into it bc he said I was overreacting.\n\n  I called the PMO office and as I told the story, the officer on the phone sounded mortified and kept apologizing. He asked for details about who the officer was, and said he'd take care of it. My friends are going both ways on my reaction. Most of the men think I'm crazy bc not only is he an officer but he is a military PMO. The moms agree with me. Everyone thinks being in the military makes you above reproach and many are but we all have known Marines and Sailors who have gotten busted for child p*** and domestic abuse. \n\nSo, AITA for reporting the officer for this?\n\nTldr: Reported an officer for driving around my neighborhood picking up kids at night without telling their parents.", "created_utc": 1699195590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17odfnh/aita_for_reporting_an_officer_for_giving_my_kid_a/", "score": 214, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe he offered it to them after they got in. None of us other than the child and officer knows for sure. If he didn\u2019t follow protocol for giving rides he\u2019s in the wrong but for you and Op to jump to conclusions that he was enticing and luring kids with candy is absurd and 100% a contribution to why our society is so messed up.

Was it dark out? I guess it doesn't change the stranger-danger question, at least from your perspective, in any way, but the officer saw girls walking around after dark and he offered what he perceived to be a safer option.  Sadly, he apparently forgot what world he lives in.\n\nOn the flip side, had he noticed the kids and neglected to offer them a ride, and after that they got kidnapped, hit by a car, attacked by an animal, or otherwise injured themselves in any number of age-appropriate but still potentially life threatening ways, and this fact was discovered by you after the fact, I'm sure your initial thought would have been \"Well, at least he didn't give them a ride.

To get on this base, everyone is carded or with someone who is carded. I am fairly confident that he was PMO. They're constantly in our neighborhood trying to catch folks speeding in th 20 mph zone. I've never seen any of them talking to children or offering rides.", "The \"United front\" ship has sailed YEARS ago. We don't fight in front of the kids, or really ever, but we don't agree on a lot of things pertaining to our kids. I'm more cautious, he's all loose goosey. Except he is more strict and weird about our daughter. I treat them equally.", "Neither my son nor daughter knew the officer. My daughter wasn't walking. She was standing outside her friend's house. All of the houses have a cul- de- sac feel bc they have a road off of the main roads for people to park and the kids usually play in them. It keeps them from being in the road. It was dark out bc it was 7pm on the east coast in the fall. Everything is really well-lit and has sidewalks on both sides of the road. I often walk 6miles on the walking path when i get off work late at night. There are no predator animals where I live. Haven't even seen roaming dogs. It's forested but gated the whole way around. The worst we have are a few foxes, racoons and deer. So many deer. \n\nI didn't label him a predator. I didn't call PMO to complain he was a predator.

It's unfortunate, bc he could have just been a really good guy helping out kids.

I don't want him to stop being a good person, if that was his intention, but like speak to ONE adult about having their kid in your car.", "I agree that that is their role in society but not everyone can be trusted. It was weird to me bc the neighborhood is pretty quiet and isolated.  If the kids are walking around, the likelihood of their trip being more than 5-10 minutes at a slow, kid's pace is highly unlikely. He didn't speak with the parents of any of the kids. It just rubbed me weird.", "Dude approached at least two groups of strange children and offered them candy to get them to ride in his car at a reasonable hour for kids to be about. He\u2019s going for creep bingo and getting the win. \n\nIf he\u2019s actually well intentioned then he\u2019s the moron for not realizing the optics of that. Not the literal child agreeing to follow the directions of a uniformed authority figure. Is there seriously an adult person who doesn\u2019t realize that offering strange kids candy to get in your car is incredibly inappropriate??? It\u2019s such a stereotype you could get the idea across in emojis. \n\nIf he\u2019s so dense that he though his actions were a good idea then he apparently needs someone to tell him otherwise.
