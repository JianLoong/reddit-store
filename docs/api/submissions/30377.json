I'm posting from my phone, so please forgive me. \n\nI (38F) have two kids (13M & 13F) with my (38M) husband. We living on a military base, which is admittedly relatively safe but not perfect, in a neighborhood surrounded by woods and water. With the kids being a bit older and the relative safety of the neighborhood, we let our kids explore and play with their friends outside with little to no oversight. \n\nThey're good kids with great grades and never get into trouble, and they always have their phones on them (which I check their location on occasionally so I know where they are.) Yesterday my daughter was with her friend who lived right behind us and walked home around 7pm. At the same time, my son walked home a girl and her little sister (3 blocks away) with his best friend. My daughter is sitting with us in the living room and sees a Snap from my son that he is getting a ride from a police officer. I asked her what she was talking about, and she explains that an officer pulled up to her and her friend asking if they wanted rides. She didn't feel comfortable and said no thank you, but apparently my son and his friends hopped in the car.\n\n I tried to call my son and he didn't answer, so I jumped in the car and went the 3 blocks to the girl's house. By then, the officer was gone, the girls were inside and my son and his friend were on their way back to our block. I made sure the friend got home and told my son not to get into cars with strangers (\"But he's an officer and he gave us candy!\"), especially without letting us know where he is. The whole time I'm speaking, my husband is mocking me. So my kids make jokes too. Both kids finally said they knew better and wouldn't do it again, but their dad and I got into it bc he said I was overreacting.\n\n  I called the PMO office and as I told the story, the officer on the phone sounded mortified and kept apologizing. He asked for details about who the officer was, and said he'd take care of it. My friends are going both ways on my reaction. Most of the men think I'm crazy bc not only is he an officer but he is a military PMO. The moms agree with me. Everyone thinks being in the military makes you above reproach and many are but we all have known Marines and Sailors who have gotten busted for child p*** and domestic abuse. \n\nSo, AITA for reporting the officer for this?\n\nTldr: Reported an officer for driving around my neighborhood picking up kids at night without telling their parents.", "created_utc": 1699195590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17odfnh/aita_for_reporting_an_officer_for_giving_my_kid_a/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If a kid calls and asks for a ride, that\u2019s one thing.

But that certainly doesn\u2019t seem like that case here. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019d keep following up until you get confirmation some form of disciplinary action has been taken because an officer shouldn\u2019t be stopping random kids and having them get in their car.", "NTA.\n\nWe're in the world where you don't do that anymore.  Also, letting them feel safe about it now could lead to them feeling safe with the \"WRONG\" person or someone who \"looks\" like an officer but is evil.", "NTA, based entirely on the PMO's reaction. If this was something that the department was OK with, they would've said something along the lines of \"oh yeah, we do a safe rides program to make sure kids get home safe at curfew.\" Instead, the department immediately jumped to apologizing and offering to \"take care of it\" which is proof enough that the officer's behavior was out of line. Being in uniform isn't an automatic pass to do things that aren't typically acceptable. Any other situation with a strange adult offering rides to a bunch of tweens would be treated with extra suspicion, a uniform shouldn't change that.", "NTA.

The new creeper candy van", "Halloween was Tuesday. I\u2019ve seen PMO and police hand out candy in neighborhoods during trick or treat and still give out candy after the fact. I doubt he was using it lure the kids into the car. Op said her son said but he was an officer and gave us candy, not he was an officer and said if we get in with him he will give us candy. Maybe he offered it to them after they got in. None of us other than the child and officer knows for sure. If he didn\u2019t follow protocol for giving rides he\u2019s in the wrong but for you and Op to jump to conclusions that he was enticing and luring kids with candy is absurd and 100% a contribution to why our society is so messed up. Guilty of wrong doing and perverse behavior with zero proof.", "Yeah, they have now lost the privilege. If they are at a friend's, they will be picked up after dark again. They have an 8pm curfew on weekends, which is about to be moved up with the days growing shorter. Their dad is more nonchalant about it, so I was trying not to be as uptight.
