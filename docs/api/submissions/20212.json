Years of using me, taking my money, physically, verbally and emotionally manipulating me is the cause of it. She has never liked my boyfriend due to the fact that in her head she believes he \u201ctook\u201d me from her. I was never allowed to see him and I was only allowed to leave the house to go to work. I ended up packing everything and moved out in the middle of the night when I was 20. I went no contact for a couple of months until I found out I was pregnant. I felt that I was obligated to tell my parents because this will be their grandkid. When I told my mother she said that I purposely laid on my back and she was NOT happy for me and is not happy about \u201cthat thing\u201d inside of me. When that happened I went no contact for another month. She is now happy that my daughter will be her first grandchild, but still is not happy about who the dad is. He is not welcomed at my parents house for any circumstances. My boyfriend has never done or said anything for her to hate him as much as she does. I recently had my baby shower on June 18th and my parents were the only ones who didn\u2019t show up. Due to all of this I only want my boyfriend in the delivery room. I don\u2019t trust that she will keep her downgrading opinions to herself in a moment that is supposed to be joyful. \nWhen I told her about this, she said that I am selfish for taking that moment away from her. I told her that after one hour of bonding time we will welcome everyone into the room for everyone to meet our daughter. Her response to that was when I get discharged I need to bring our daughter to her house without my boyfriend so they can meet her. \nWIBTAH if I inform her that if she doesn\u2019t come to the hospital to meet our daughter she won\u2019t be allowed in our lives?", "created_utc": 1687322544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14exmr8/aitah_for_telling_my_mom_she_wont_be_welcomed_in/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Time to find your inner momma-bear, and go no contact. \n\nYour mom doesn\u2019t have any right to know your daughter. She doesn\u2019t have a right to be in your life. And painful as it is- she is incapable of loving you the way you deserve. It\u2019s not your fault. It is hers. \n\nDo yourself a favor and find a counselor and parenting classes so you can learn how to really break the abuse cycle. There are things that you might think are normal that are actually really nothing. It\u2019s kind of a typical think when you have an asshole parent.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nShe probably shouldn't be allowed in your lives anyway.", "As a parent, your primary duty to your child is to maintain his/her safety.  It seems to me that your mother is not a safe space for anybody.  I wouldn't allow her in your hospital room, your home, your child's life.  But you can make your own choices.  \n\nIn response to your question though, YWNBTA.", "I don't know why you want her in your life. She needs to demonstrate that she can be supportive and a good person before she's allowed within a mile of you and your family. And she doesn't just need to do that once. She needs to show a pattern of good behavior for a long time. She is not entitled to be in your life, in the birthing room, or anywhere else where she can treat you like an asshole NTA", "NTA. You've tried repeatedly to include your mom in your life, from sharing news of your pregnancy, to inviting her to the \"baby shower\" (I'm assuming you meant to say gender reveal party) and now inviting her to welcome your baby into the world. There was 0 effort from your mother to try to be in your life. With all due respect she sounds like a nasty and narcissistic person. Your ultimatum is more than fair. If she wants to be a part of your life, she needs to start showing up for you", "NTA, don't let her pressure you on this. She is not showing you and your partner respect, she does not deserve to be part of your child's life.", "NTA, but you should only give an ultimatum if you're willing to follow up on it if she doesn't come. Are you ready to cut her off completely and for the rest of your life? Nothing wrong with being ready to do this, but if you're not 100% sure, perhaps word it differently?", "No offense but your mother seems a bit on the crazy side of things.  I think your doing the right thing. Definitely don't let her in the delivery room that's for you n the baby's father.  Your mother should be overjoyed with the fact that you have a man and soon to be father who sounds like he wants to be there for you n his child. She should be supportive not destructive.  Keep her at arms length until she comes to her senses hopefully.", "NTA. Blood doesn\u2019t dictate whether she\u2019s worthy of being in your family\u2019s lives; she hasn\u2019t done anything good for you; parents themselves refused to be at the baby shower, so why have the right to be at the hospital? You\u2019re just setting firm boundaries for your family.", "NTA she has to accept and treat respectfully your partner. Also you. From my own experience I can tell you, you don\u2019t even know what respect and support from her is. You will probably never get it. Don\u2019t put your sweet baby in the middle.", "I wouldn't bother telling her anything. Honestly, I don't think you are going NC long enough. Your mom knows that no matter how badly she treats you and your boyfriend, or how horrible she is just in general, that after a short period of time you will end up talking to her again. You have tiny human that is relying on you for protection, so think about how horrible this woman has been, and think if you really want to subject your child to the same abuse. No? Then block her number and any other way of her being able to contact you. Put her name on a \"banned\" list at the hospital so they wont let her through while you are in labor. \n\nGrandparents are nice to have, but not a necessity when they are evil. And people who raised you CHOSE to raise you, you do not owe them anything for simply keeping you alive. They need to earn the title of grandparents, and your mother has done nothing to earn it. The opposite, in fact.\n\nYou are only TA if you let this toxic woman around your child.", "NTA. Sorry sweetheart, but you need to rid yourself of this toxic woman. If she can't accept your partner,she doesn't deserve you. He and your daughter are your family now. Good luck. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. She\u2019s acting like a rotten toddler. Your baby, your rules. She has absolutely no right to lay down rules. This is your chance to start setting boundaries and sticking to them. And she doesn\u2019t need to be in the delivery room. Congratulations on your new life!", "Nta, I understand she is your mother. However you need to establish that she needs to respect the father of your child. If she can\u2019t do the bare minimum then she doesn\u2019t have a place in your guys life. \n\nIf your mother truly cared about you then she would never ask you to travel to her after giving birth. I have given birth twice and i cant not imagine asking any parent who just had a child to come to me. That is one of the most selfish thing and disregard for someone else well being.", "NTA. You\u2019re decision 100% and you are definitely justified in this situation. She is the one being selfish, and you should probably cut contact with her until she decides to change.", "NTA and you may as well make it official now. She doesn't sound like someone who SHOULD be around a kid anyway.", "A lot of shit goes down in that first hour. It won't be enough. She can wait until the next day or, better yet, a much longer timeout.", "NTA, do yourself a favour and when you go no contact again, make it stay that way. And if she pushes, get a restraining order.", "YWNBTA and echoing the other comments - this woman is abusive and you owe her nothing. Enjoy and prioritize your own family, enjoy everything with your boyfriend and new daughter. What she has done and is doing is not normal.", "NTA. Manipulative and abusive parents deserve nothing and are owed nothing. Quit trying to \"win\" your mom over. My ex Mil was just like your mom HATES my guts and it's consistently drove a wedge in our marriage", "YTA - You should have gone non contact but instead you  enabled her again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your daughter is just as much a part of you as she is a part of your boyfriend, and whether your mother likes it or not, he is your daughter's father. She needs to accept that and if she can't, then oh, well.

Now is the time for you to set boundaries and lay down the rules as you expect them to be going forward. That means your partner is part of the package.
