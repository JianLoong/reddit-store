Your mom is trying to control her access to your baby by insisting you bring the baby to her.**", "She\u2019s acting like a rotten toddler. Your baby, your rules. She has absolutely no right to lay down rules. This is your chance to start setting boundaries and sticking to them. And she doesn\u2019t need to be in the delivery room. Congratulations on your new life!", "[deleted]", ">Not just the daughter's, OP needs to put her own emotional health and well being above that of her incubator/abuser.\n\nWhile this is absolutely correct OP is a young person who has been living her whole life in an intensely abusive situation and only recently got out. Realizing that she has a right to not be abused, to be happy and to tell her mom to eff off, might be a bit beyond what she's currently capable of seeing because she hasn't even begun to heal from the damage her mom has done to her. So it might be a lot easier to convince her to fight for her kid than for herself at this point.", "NTA", "Bot, comment stolen from u/nothisTrophyWife"]}
