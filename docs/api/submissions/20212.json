She eventually changed enough that we could be in each other\u2019s lives, but it\u2019s never been the type of mother daughter relationship I would\u2019ve loved. As she has aged, she\u2019s regressed and so we\u2019re back to VLC and the only reason it\u2019s not NC is because she\u2019s in the early stages of dementia. My point is that you\u2019ll be much happier and have a more peaceful life if you just walk away.
