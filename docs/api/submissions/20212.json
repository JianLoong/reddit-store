After couple of years she understood that her old ways will not work with us. Every time she tried talking behind our back, saying something nasty or lying to our relatives in order for her side of the story to sound better I instantly shut it down. 2 years ago we got our little boy and she started doing her shit again. I instantly shut it down again, and when the topic about seeing the baby came, I told her what will be tolerated and what will not. She fully understands that we are not to be stepped over and if she crosses at east one of those conditions she will have consequences. But I am not taking her grandchild from her. She has been put in her place and we are not feeding her any info that is not completely necessary. She is reaping what she sow and I'm happy for that.

There is no reason for anybody to be in that room for any other purpose.  \nWhen delivery in hospitals became more common in the last century nobody was allowed in the delivery room except the mother and medical staff. A lot of women felt left alone and vulnerable in this situation, so in the seventies they fought for support during this time. Hospitals started to allow husbands and other relatives or friends to stay during childbirth - for support, not because anybody has a right to be there and to share this moment or anything else.  \nSo there is one simple rule: You decide who is allowed in the delivery room (and who can visit you in the hospital after birth), and your decision should be based on your requirements only. There is no place for spectators, there is no place for stress. Stress during birth can actually harm your child.

Since your mom never corrected her negative behavior with you what makes you think that she won\u2019t be abusive to your daughter in the future? Do you want that toxic relationship for your child?

I read it at a difficult time in my life and it helped me a lot with healing.", "As a mom, my children don\u2019t owe me anything. I gave them life to go and live it! Children should never be an afterthought or an accident. If you are not going to raise future adults with trust and love, don\u2019t have \u2018em.", "You are right on the money with this one. I put up with abuse from close extended relatives (grandparents and aunts/uncles level) my whole life up until I was pregnant with my son. I was young when I was pregnant, and they acted like OP's mom. They called my unborn son names while acting like it was life destroying that I was becoming a mother. They also said my now husband and father of my son was controlling me and pitting me against them (laughable if you know him).  I would've never had the strength at the time to cut them off for me. I found the strength for my son, though. With the space from NC for my son, I was able to heal and hold the boundaries for myself with time.", "Why are you still trying for your mothers approval? It's not gonna happen", "Hey girlie, \n\nYoure not going to get anything from her. No genuine I love you, no Im proud of you, no I got your back. She will only learn with hard boundaries. You need therapy on how to balance your feelings regarding her. I also had to go through this with my mom. My therapist compared it to boxes in an attic. She doesnt deserve a big box if all thats in there is emptiness and spiders. I was able to fortunately better my relationship with my own mom once it sunk in her head that I can survive without her.\n\nDo not involve her in your new family. Do not compromise with her. Never say yes. It will get better for you.\n\nLove, Ms Mommy Issues", "You are not obligated to tell my parents that your are PG.  It's your child, not theirs.  You wouldn't want to put your child into a situation that may not be the best for them, so there's no need to tell them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA..  It's your kid/ family/ life..  Stand up for yourself & family..", "OP, you probably do not want her at the hospital. You may not be able to fend her off or keep her in line. Think about this. You also don\u2019t want a lot of people near a newborn baby. A baby\u2019s immune system is not developed well yet. Congratulations and best wishes to you and yours!", "NTA.  Cut her off now!!!  Don't expose your daughter to the same treatment you experienced. You've made your own family.", "NTA but y w b t a if you allow this woman into your daughter's life, she has shown she hasn't changed. do you want her daughter to experience the same things you had to literally flee from? \n\nThere's been no amends, no change, she immediately viciously insulted you when she found out you were pregnant and right now her only interest in you is your child. It still is all about her wants. You reached out to them bc of some misguided parental obligation and hope to have your parents in your life, but I'm telling you now, whatever you want from your mother, you won't get, instead you are just going to continue the cycle with your daughter, how is that fair to her? You are the parent now, your child comes first, if that means you have to sacrifice your relationship with your parents to protect her, so be it. \n\nMore importantly are you willing to let someone in your daughters life who shows open disdain for her father, she going to eventually be old enough to see and understand, when the family's invited over to your mothers house but her dad can't come. You can't trust what this woman will say about your bf around his daughter. Your mother doesn't matter, but the relationship your daughter has with her father does.\n\nEdited to add: Read your previous post and you would be completely an ah if you allow your mother any access to your child, you need to protect you daughter from this woman, you mom has shown you repeatedly she is not a good person, please stop letting her back into your life because of some misguided belief that our parents should be in our lives. You toned down the severity of your mothers abuse for this post, no your mother is abusive, protect your child at all cost, do not give your mother an opportunity to make your daughter a victim.", "Seriously? NTA Don\u2019t let your child grow up around this woman.", "OP\u2026 honestly, what does your mother bring to your table? Forget that *your* child is her grandkid. Okay? It sounds like your mom sucks and you\u2019re hoping that she\u2019ll come around someday. As the saying goes\u2026 You can shit in one hand and wish in the other and see which one fills up first.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - I gotta ask, why are you still jumping through hoops for someone that has no problem turning their back on you? Id just settle with low to no contact and end the invites; seems like all she will do is cause drama and stress.", "If she's abusive to you and still causing drama for you, how much worse could she be to the baby and once the baby gets here?? You need therapy if you need some free resources I have some \u2665  it's okay to go no contact and necessary to protect your child from her antics.

This man is going to be in your life forever & your parents are just going to have to accept that if they want a relationship with their grandchild.  As for your mom being in the delivery room, IMO,  the only one who should be in the room is the father.  It's not necessary for mom to be there.

Good luck, OP.", "NTA\n\nBut why are you even letting her come to the hospital?", "This isn't about you anymore. She absolutely will treat your child as she did you.

Why do you want to expose your baby to that person? What would be the benefit? Ask her to stay away from you and your family. You have your own family now that you need to protect from bad people.

Just think about what will happen as the years go by and she starts badmouthing your SO to your daughter.   Don\u2019t let it start, she doesn\u2019t deserve a relationship with any of you.", "NTA. From experience,  I think you should seriously consider going NC for good. I'm sure the reason she dislikes your bf is she can sense that he is able to see through her BS and see her for what she is (a selfish, immature,  manipulative AH) and she cannot control and manipulate him. Same with my mom to my husband. This is someone who will constantly disrespect you, your bf, and try to turn your kid against their own parents. This will cause so much havoc and chaos in your life and relationship, and you, your bf, and your baby deserve better than that. \n\nI wish you lots of luck, and congratulations on your baby!", "You seem like a good person and the kid\u2019s coming from your loins, so it should be entirely on your terms when someone meets the kid at any age to adulthood.
