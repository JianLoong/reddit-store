I'm not seeing it quoted anywhere when I search it online. Also would 60% of fathers filing for full custody imply the courts favor men? Because it seems like the statistic that would indicate that would be something like the following: when both parents file for full custody, a percentage of greater than 50% of men receive it. Because if that 60% is accurate in what percentage of those cases is the mother not filing for full custody or even relinquishing rights? From a quick check of statistics it seems like the bias has shifted to be less of a problem but generally in both litigation and public perception in the US, full custody is generally given more frequently to mothers.\nhttps://www.justgreatlawyers.com/legal-guides/child-custody-statistics", "The problem is, it doesn\u2019t work that way in every place.

Also inform your work.", "The 60% is when custody is contested, meaning both parties ask for it and the court decides. From what I can tell, it's not because of a bias toward men, but because of a bias toward money. Men mostly come out of divorces more financially well-off than women do, and it's easy for courts to assume that the parent who can provide a child with greater material advantages is better for the child. (All else being equal, it's even true; but all else rarely is.) \n\nAs for the statistic, I got it from a Massachusetts study, but can't find it online anymore. The source I could find right now is a custody attorney citing the same study I had originally looked at, but it's something: \n\nhttp://gitlinlawfirm.com/family-law/child-custody/custody-of-children/\n\n[EDIT: More sources. Just took a bit more searching. Here's a Chicago Tribune article which cites the same statistic: https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-08-22-9408220044-story.html\n\nAnd one from the New York Times.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/13/nyregion/l-on-fathers-winning-custody-cases-130159.html ] \n\nSome additional information: \n\nhttp://leadershipcouncil.org/1/pas/dv.html\n\nWho Wins Custody Battles: The Effect of Gender Bias https://mackseyjournal.scholasticahq.com/api/v1/articles/38965-who-wins-custody-battles-the-effect-of-gender-bias.pdf (bottom of page 5 to top of page 6 particularly relevant)\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.huffpost.com/entry/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115/amp#ip=1\n\n\nWhat does keep coming up over and over again -- no matter what the source -- is that more than 90% of custody cases are decided between the parents with no attempt made to contest. Of those, the overwhelming majority assign primary custody to women. \n\nHow much of this is because men who are divorcing don't want to deal with their former families, how much of it is because they don't think the courts would give them a chance at custody so they give up without a fight, and how much is for other reasons? I have no idea and as far as I am aware, neither does anyone else right now.\n\nMost U.S. courts these days prioritize joint custody if there's no evidence of serious problems with either parent, and IMO that's the way it should be. My kids were raised jointly by both sides of their family and we were among the many families who didn't contest the matter... we chose ourselves to request joint custody, because we both cared about our kids and wanted them to have the best from both of us.

Don't feel bad and don't look back. You gave that child a chance to grow up with a loving parent figure. I mean that baby literally had drugs in their system! You 100% did the right thing!", "You're very welcome. I had a good time digging through the available info again... it's been a while. I did a paper on this once, but it's been several years. \n\nBack in the 1980s, when the courts really were biased in favor of mothers at least for younger children (what was referred to as the 'tender years doctrine') I was a victim of either the bias or the assumptions around it; it was hard to say which. My father had always been my primary caregiver, but he yielded primary custody to my mother because he didn't believe any man could win primary custody of a 12-year-old girl. \n\nWas he correct? I have no idea. I do know that the concept of joint custody, which was nearly universal when I divorced my children's father a quarter century later, either didn't exist at the time or none of us had ever heard of it. It just wasn't brought up. \n\nEverything is incredibly different now, at least in families like mine, where both parents were committed to working together for the benefit of the children even though they don't want to stay married. My ex is still a good friend, and the four of us (him, me and both of our current spouses) consider ourselves a single unit: \"our kids' parents.\" We may not be directly family to each other anymore, but we're both family to the same kids and always will be. \n\nThe hardest part seems to come up in cases where there's an abusive parent... either parent. When it's the father, the unfortunate truth is that a mother who brings evidence of abuse to the court is *less* likely to win custody instead of more, because 'parental alienation' is treated more seriously than child abuse, and even telling the court accurately that abuse has occurred is regarded as parental alienation!! \n\nWhen the abusive parent is the mother, parental alienation is rarely cited -- there are studies I found in today's ramble through the subject which show that it is pretty much never considered at all as a claim against men, but it is taken very seriously indeed as a claim against women. But that doesn't make anything much easier for a man whose children's mother has abused either them or him... it's still hard to make a court believe that women can also be physical abusers, even though it's true. \n\nAll things considered, the divorce courts really need to train more effectively in the facts about abusive families. They're basing a great deal of their decisionmaking on myths, of several different kinds. Any parent who has to bring a claim of abuse against their ex will have an uphill battle.", "NTA.
