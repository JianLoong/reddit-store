Other residents that I've come to know as friends are all older and either married or in serious relationships. \n\nI'm not in any of those.

She told me she wanted to change her shift with mine, so that she could have more free time to plan it. Usually I'd be okay with this but the week before I met a girl I really really liked and I planned to go on a date with her on that day. I don't want to be the AH who reschedules last minute. \n\nSo I told Jasmine exactly that, and said that I was going on a date. She got very disappointed and said she couldn't believe that I thought her son's birthday is less important than a date with a girl I've only met last week. She said especially it is already clear how this relationship will end up given my history (I don't usually do long term relationships).\n\nI was a bit shocked by her comment and I told her gossip won't get her anywhere and she'd better find another solution since I won't be helping her.

Her lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on your part. Go have your date and have fun.", "NTA. Just because you have been gracious in switching shifts in the past does not mean you are required to switch shifts anytime someone asks. You have a life, and your life is not meant to be lived around other people's schedules. Prioritize yourself and your plans!! \n\nJasmine's response shows great emotional immaturity.", "NTA\n\nTell your \"friends\" that you were really stressed out because you suddenly realized you were being gossiped about and taken advantage of.", "NTA. Exactly as you said, her situation is not your problem. It's great that you have been willing to help the other residents so often but none of them are entitled to that. You are more than entitled to prioritize your own needs/desires, not only \"despite\" your history of willingness to cover shifts but also \"because\" of that track record of helpfulness.", "Nope, NTA. Just because you are single and without kids does not mean you have to be at everyone's beck and call and should prioritize *them* in your free time. No. Beyond that, your \"friend\" literally *insulting* you when you said no is a GREAT way to get you to change your mind and help her /s\n\nHer being stressed is not an excuse to try to manipulate you and insult your dating history.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**It is high time you started to set some boundaries.** Stop giving reasons - just say: NO, that does not work for me\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My other friends said I was rude to her because she was just stressed \" .. No. She was rude tro you, ANd massively exploiting you.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't owe anybody anything. The way she responded shows that she feels entitled.

NTA at all mate.", "NTA - and I wouldn't call anyone who thought you were the rude one in this scenario a friend.  Jasmine was the rude one.  Why is her son's birthday more important than your date?  I don't care what your track record is, your \"history\" is none of her business.  Besides that, her son's birthday is the same day every year, perhaps she should learn to start planning sooner than later.", "NTA - it's not your obligation to switch with anyone. It's also not her business to know why you're unavailable to do so if you can't. This woman sounds entitled and rude af. Her life is not more important than yours.", "NTA. \n\nI also think that your title is misleading because that's not the situation. The question should be are you an AH for not switching shifts with someone who wanted more time to plan a birthday party. Even then YWNBTA. \n\nYou are not required to switch shifts with anyone. Ever. It's at your discretion. Also, if it's such a big deal, I dare jasmine to ask the scheduler to change it and see what they say. She won't ask because they'd likely get a lecture about time management, how to juggle your schedule as a doctor and having 9274929 things on the go. \n\nAlso, it doesn't matter if you weren't even going on a date. If you just wanted to lay in bed vegging put and watching movies, that's still fine! It's YOUR time. And she's an AH for making it about who is more important. Here's a fact: YOU'RE more important. You come first. I'm sure if she asked to switch shifts because they scheduled her to work ON his birthday, you would definitely switch. But this is to plan it. Get help. She can ask her parents or in-laws or partner to help. This isn't on you. \n\nAlso, she's not a friend. Now she's strictly a colleague.", "NTA. Oh, so now the frequency of your relationships dictates the importance of your personal time? Good to know. You've been the accommodating shift-swap friend, and the one time you want a day to yourself, it's suddenly a referendum on your dating history? Jasmine can find another way to celebrate her son's birthday without policing your personal life. The entitlement is real with this one.", "NTA. Her son's birthday shouldn't be a surprise to her- her poor planning isn't your problem, and guilting/shaming you is an AH move especially bringing up your dating history.", "NTA. She asked for a favor, you politely declined and even trusted her enough to open up about why. She insulted you up and down in response. (Of course your date is more important than her son's birthday! To you, it is!) If your friends want you to excuse and dismiss her nastiness in response for being told no, you need new friends. Anyone who responds to not getting a favor with a personal attack is definitely an asshole, doesn't matter how stressed out they may claim to be.", "Keep ur plans", "NTA. Wow what a mean, entitled person!   \n\n\nIt sounds like she (and maybe others?) have taken you for granted. I'm glad you are doing what you want with your time.

Now I\u2019m not comfortable switching shifts with her any more. Nor with anyone else who gossips about me behind my back.\u201d If anyone is dumb enough to side with her, blacklist them too.
