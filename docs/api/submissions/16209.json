I help around the house whenever they need me too and I even helped with bills if they asked me. However, my oldest sister (29F) and her husband (30M) also stay with us since they couldn\u2019t get a loan for a house they wanted. 2 years ago, my sister gave birth to the first kid in the family (let\u2019s call her J). J is a okay kid but I do wish they would discipline her much more often. For example, she throws tantrums when she\u2019s not allowed in the kitchen when we\u2019re cooking, bites the family dogs, and throws food on the floor. My other issue is that I had to change my entire life for her even though she\u2019s not my kid. I use to get up at 7am for work since my job was close by and didn\u2019t have to rush. Now I have to wake up at 6am since my sister says she needs me to help out with the kid in the morning. I\u2019m not allowed to play loud music in my room past 9 since it\u2019s sleepy time for J. I have to give a week or so notice whether I\u2019m going out at night since they need to make sure I don\u2019t wake up J. I clean up after the kid when she makes a mess and I have even been told to wash some of her dishes. Basically whatever J needs, I have to do it for her. Worse of all, J doesn\u2019t sleep at night. There have been times that she wakes up in the middle of the night and making noise in their bedroom which I\u2019m next to. If you\u2019re wondering where the husband is, he works majority of the day. He leaves at 5am ish and doesn\u2019t come back until 8pm (I think he\u2019s an asphalt worker or something like that idk). My sister also works a corporate job like myself so she does work from home 2 times out of the week. Now to the worse of things; every time I don\u2019t help out with the kid, my sister tell my parents that I hate her. We have gotten into arguments about using the word hate just for not helping them with my niece J. My parents come up to me and tell me to help them out. That it takes a village to raise a kid. But what if some of the villagers don\u2019t want to raise the kid. They shouldn\u2019t be outed and verbally harassed for not helping since it\u2019s not their kid. I want to be a cool uncle but a third parent to J. Maybe I don\u2019t understand how hard it is to raise a kid and I\u2019m just being mean. But if they had their own place to live, they wouldn\u2019t have this much help. I think once I move out, I\u2019ll go NC with my family since I have been made to look like the bad guy. I have told them how I feel multiple times but it never goes anywhere. Everyone just assumes that I don\u2019t like the kid and have told other family members that I don\u2019t like to spend time with J.", "created_utc": 1683028748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135j12i/aita_for_not_helping_out_my_sister_with_her_kid/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But since they want you to help out  with the kid, start telling the kid NO in a firm voice, then sit down  face level and tell  kid  why  did wrong.  If kid bites dog,  Say NO, we do not bite Doggie, how would you feel if Doggie bit you?    \n\n\nAnd when they complain, just say you are doing the village thing and  they wanted this, after awhile they will give up asking you or you move out.", "NTA J is not your kid and they shouldn\u2019t be expecting you to help out so much. Keeping the noise down at night is understandable but outside of that you can do what you want. Time to set some clear boundaries and the place to start is with your parents. You need to get them on board, because it sounds like they are also using you to get out of looking after this kid too. \nHow long until you can move out?", "NTA J isn't your kid OR your problem. You shouldn't be having to chane your entire life around because your sister had a kid", "NTA, Honestly move out as fast as you can. Start refusing to help, that is not your kid- you didn\u2019t sign up for it. You are 23 you don\u2019t need to be worrying about a kid THAT ISN\u2019T YOURS.  You are not mean, not wrong, and your sister is unhinged. Get out fast!! I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to go NC.", "NTA. \n\nI say that as a parent too. Not your kid, not your problem. Love it when family *offers* to help out or does something nice for us, but I never ask. Wait.. no I've asked for my parents to drop off some meals twice when we were all super sick. But like pretty much never. They're my kids, my responsibility. Imo that's not what 'it takes a village' means. There's no obligation there.\n\nEdit to add that most of the behaviour you listed is pretty standard for two year olds.", "NTA. You are the uncle, not the father. Liking the kid has nothing to do with being put into the position of quasi-parent. Your sister has her husband, your parents, herself and you. That's far more assistance than most do on a daily basis - and the child is two! Your sister has one child, and certainly should be able to take care of her in the morning without you arising early. And running to your parents with complaints is ridiculous. If they had been able to afford their house, she'd be on her own - she's milking this situation for all it's worth. Keep saving and move out as soon as possible.", "NTA however as much as they can live elsewhere, you can to. \n\nYou are choosing to stay there because it's financially beneficial to you but if your wellbeing and relationship with your family is taking a hit, is it really worth it?", "Time to move out.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Not your kid, just get out of the situation as soon as you can.", "NTA at all\n\nYour sister works corporate, and her husband works as a full time construction guy and they can't afford to even rent a place? Either they're just mooching off of your parents, or someone's lying about their job. \n\nYou're already doing wayyyy more than you should be doing. Just being related to a kid doesn't automatically mean that you have to have a hand in raising them. If the kid was planned, I don't understand why your sister and her husband would ever think it was the right time to have a child if they can't get their shit together. \n\nAlso, lol the KID is biting the DOGS?", "move.. don't move to the luxury place yet, move to a normal one.. or to a professional house share or something. \nit's not going to get better if you stay", "NTA \n\nJ is your niece, not your daughter, so you shouldn\u2019t be expected to do so much. It was the parents who created the kid, so why is she your burden to bear? *She isn\u2019t*. \n\nBeing quiet because she\u2019s asleep, I can get behind. That\u2019s basic courtesy. But everything else you \u201chave\u201d to do isn\u2019t. If they moved out, there would only be the two of them to raise her, discipline her etc. So why they think that because you live in the same house you should be her third parent, is beyond me. \n\nBut as much as they can move out, so can you. I know you say you\u2019re saving for a place, and are living with them whilst doing so. But your relationship with your family is taking a bit because of it. You\u2019re expected to basically help raise your niece because you\u2019re there. Is that really worth it? Is it time you moved out to save the relationship with your family, as well as your own sanity? \n\nYou say that once you move out, you\u2019ll go NC because of it all. And if that\u2019s what you truly want to do, then nobody can stop you. But have you stopped to think that once you move out, things could improve with your family?", "NTA\nNot your kid, not your problem. The little monster bites the poor dog?! Hope doggo bites back. I would honestly just do what you want because at the end of the day your sister and her husband don\u2019t own the house, if you want to wake up late, wake up late if you wanna go out, go out there not your parents.", "NTA but start telling them no and your schedule is NOT their business. It doesn\u2019t matter when you\u2019re going out. Your sister can deal with her own kid. You are biding your time until August, but use this last bit to learn to say no and once you\u2019re out and go NC \u2026 they should already know why. You are not the bad guy. Not your circus, not your monkey.", "Not your kid so of course NTA, but really, just move the fuck out. It's not worth the saving.", "Try to avoid them, move out when you can and go NC", "NTA. Helping around the house and staying quiet at naptime are both common courtesies. Beyond that, your sister is manipulative and being unfair to everyone around her. She should parent her child, you should be cool uncle (with occasional scolding when she bites the dog, because she needs to respect authority, as one would in the village).\n\nMove out in August. Don't go no contact unless they start harassing you for not being there to raise her. No use burning bridges, and your niece will miss you.", "NTA. You\u2019re in a very unfair situation and your parents aren\u2019t considering your feelings nearly enough. That hurts and I\u2019m sorry. Chin up. I\u2019m NC with my parents and I\u2019ve never regretted it once. Good luck and big hugs", "I feel bad for the dog.  I guarantee that it will be put down when it has enough and growls or bites the child.\n\nNTA", "In all this, I feel only the parents/grandparents can complain. They have two grown ass kids moving into their home for their own gain (the luxury condo one, the never ending childcare the other). \nYou ESH here! Move out!!!", "NTA but this will go on until you move out.  They are not going to let it go but you are totally within your rights to keep standing up for yourself.", "NTA, but you are free to leave. Your niece is only 2 years old. She doesn\u2019t sound that out of control. She lives there too so you can\u2019t just ignore her. Best just to move out.", "NTA\n\nNot your kid, not your problem.\n\nYou are either going to accept that by not helping you are going to be portrayed as the selfish AH. I myself would be fine with that, I'm not helping with someone else's kid.\n\nNow if you don't want to be portrayed as the AH, you are going to have to suck it up and help until you move out.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s sound like you don\u2019t like the kid, which is perfectly fine and normal. We don\u2019t like everyone in our family.\n\nBut it\u2019s her child, when she decided to have she should have consider raising kid on her own, not expecting it from family. She should have consider that she may need a babysitter as her family has every right to say no. It\u2019s her child, it is part of family, but if you don\u2019t want to help every day - it\u2019s not your responsibility.", "NTA. It's true that it takes a village to raise a child, but you're also right that an unwilling village won't do the kid any good. It sucks that you're basically stuck raising a kid you didn't ask for since her actual father is only around when she's asleep and her mother apparently can't do her morning routine alone? What was the plan if they did get that loan they wanted? Have other people move in with them to help out?\n\nStart getting your ducks in a row to move out. Maybe consider a downgrade from that luxury downtown apartment to be out the door sooner. You're an adult and capable of making your own decisions, and you can absolutely decide you don't want to raise a child that's not yours.", "NTA. I'd have been long gone.", "YTA for way too many irrelevant details and not understanding your situation. Your story is basically \"I am a working adult living with my parents and extended family to save money. They expect me to do things that i don't like and they expect me to arrange some of my life to accommodate them. AITA?\" Are you really too slow to understand that this is not an ethical dilemma. Only YOU can decide whether free lodging is worth the hassles and expectations that come from living in a home with extended family.", "YTA \n\nNot because you don't want to help with the kid, but because you are an adult choosing to live in a situation where the household you are living with expects a certain level of cooperation.  \n\nYou don't want to do it, fine.  Then leave.  Now, not when the luxury apartment you want is available.  That is your option.  Your parents expect your cooperation as long as you choose to remain under their roof.  You don't like it so leave.", "Your sister is an AH! If i was you I\u2019d just find a place with a Roomate until u save up enough to get the apartment you want. Your sister is manipulating and rude and you help out and have changed your life ALOT to cater to their little family. You need to have a sit down talk with ur parents, out of the house, and let them know u love ur niece and ur sister, but you are an adult and have your own life, and that you really don\u2019t want this to ruin the relationship you have with them. If they still continue to make you the bad guy, then at least you know you did the right thing and tried to fix things. Does the niece go to daycare during the day, or does you mom do a lot of the caring for her by chance?", "NTA! You are the uncle, not the parent. It is not on you.", "YTA. You live at home and your parents have said to help out. Do it or move out already.", "ESH - You shouldn\u2019t be expected to help with the kid but also this is a 2 year old and most of the rest of what you\u2019re complaining about is just basic living with a toddler stuff.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Pay bills and general cleaning. You are not ,however, obligated to constantly pick up after and discipline your niece. You are not her nanny. That's her dad's and her mom's responsibility. You can suggest having a schedule for everyone eg you do dishes this week, they do it next week, you throw out trash one week etc. If that helps. You get the idea. It's ok to help out with your niece if it's when they ask you to because they're busy with work or just need a power nap and such but not just because it takes a village. The village is to provide support and not be the mayor/sheriff in town. I suggest you reconsider staying at a decent condo/apartment instead of a luxury one.

I do think some of the minor things you could ease up on like the music (wear headphones, easy solution), but to try and force soemone to help with her kid and then use the 'if you don't help with the kid, I tell everyone you hate them' card is just uncalled for and super shitty. I hate hearing parents say those things. It's her kid, she can't expect everyone else to want to help.
