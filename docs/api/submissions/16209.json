I help around the house whenever they need me too and I even helped with bills if they asked me. However, my oldest sister (29F) and her husband (30M) also stay with us since they couldn\u2019t get a loan for a house they wanted. 2 years ago, my sister gave birth to the first kid in the family (let\u2019s call her J). J is a okay kid but I do wish they would discipline her much more often. For example, she throws tantrums when she\u2019s not allowed in the kitchen when we\u2019re cooking, bites the family dogs, and throws food on the floor. My other issue is that I had to change my entire life for her even though she\u2019s not my kid. I use to get up at 7am for work since my job was close by and didn\u2019t have to rush. Now I have to wake up at 6am since my sister says she needs me to help out with the kid in the morning. I\u2019m not allowed to play loud music in my room past 9 since it\u2019s sleepy time for J. I have to give a week or so notice whether I\u2019m going out at night since they need to make sure I don\u2019t wake up J. I clean up after the kid when she makes a mess and I have even been told to wash some of her dishes. Basically whatever J needs, I have to do it for her. Worse of all, J doesn\u2019t sleep at night. There have been times that she wakes up in the middle of the night and making noise in their bedroom which I\u2019m next to. If you\u2019re wondering where the husband is, he works majority of the day. He leaves at 5am ish and doesn\u2019t come back until 8pm (I think he\u2019s an asphalt worker or something like that idk). My sister also works a corporate job like myself so she does work from home 2 times out of the week. Now to the worse of things; every time I don\u2019t help out with the kid, my sister tell my parents that I hate her. We have gotten into arguments about using the word hate just for not helping them with my niece J. My parents come up to me and tell me to help them out. That it takes a village to raise a kid. But what if some of the villagers don\u2019t want to raise the kid. They shouldn\u2019t be outed and verbally harassed for not helping since it\u2019s not their kid. I want to be a cool uncle but a third parent to J. Maybe I don\u2019t understand how hard it is to raise a kid and I\u2019m just being mean. But if they had their own place to live, they wouldn\u2019t have this much help. I think once I move out, I\u2019ll go NC with my family since I have been made to look like the bad guy. I have told them how I feel multiple times but it never goes anywhere. Everyone just assumes that I don\u2019t like the kid and have told other family members that I don\u2019t like to spend time with J.", "created_utc": 1683028748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135j12i/aita_for_not_helping_out_my_sister_with_her_kid/", "score": 541, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But since they want you to help out  with the kid, start telling the kid NO in a firm voice, then sit down  face level and tell  kid  why  did wrong.  If kid bites dog,  Say NO, we do not bite Doggie, how would you feel if Doggie bit you?    \n\n\nAnd when they complain, just say you are doing the village thing and  they wanted this, after awhile they will give up asking you or you move out.", "NTA J is not your kid and they shouldn\u2019t be expecting you to help out so much. Keeping the noise down at night is understandable but outside of that you can do what you want. Time to set some clear boundaries and the place to start is with your parents. You need to get them on board, because it sounds like they are also using you to get out of looking after this kid too. \nHow long until you can move out?", "NTA J isn't your kid OR your problem. You shouldn't be having to chane your entire life around because your sister had a kid", "NTA, Honestly move out as fast as you can. Start refusing to help, that is not your kid- you didn\u2019t sign up for it. You are 23 you don\u2019t need to be worrying about a kid THAT ISN\u2019T YOURS.  You are not mean, not wrong, and your sister is unhinged. Get out fast!! I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to go NC.", "NTA. \n\nI say that as a parent too. Not your kid, not your problem. Love it when family *offers* to help out or does something nice for us, but I never ask. Wait.. no I've asked for my parents to drop off some meals twice when we were all super sick. But like pretty much never. They're my kids, my responsibility. Imo that's not what 'it takes a village' means. There's no obligation there.\n\nEdit to add that most of the behaviour you listed is pretty standard for two year olds.", "NTA. You are the uncle, not the father. Liking the kid has nothing to do with being put into the position of quasi-parent. Your sister has her husband, your parents, herself and you. That's far more assistance than most do on a daily basis - and the child is two! Your sister has one child, and certainly should be able to take care of her in the morning without you arising early. And running to your parents with complaints is ridiculous. If they had been able to afford their house, she'd be on her own - she's milking this situation for all it's worth. Keep saving and move out as soon as possible.", "NTA however as much as they can live elsewhere, you can to. \n\nYou are choosing to stay there because it's financially beneficial to you but if your wellbeing and relationship with your family is taking a hit, is it really worth it?", "Time to move out.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Not your kid, just get out of the situation as soon as you can.", "NTA at all\n\nYour sister works corporate, and her husband works as a full time construction guy and they can't afford to even rent a place? Either they're just mooching off of your parents, or someone's lying about their job. \n\nYou're already doing wayyyy more than you should be doing. Just being related to a kid doesn't automatically mean that you have to have a hand in raising them. If the kid was planned, I don't understand why your sister and her husband would ever think it was the right time to have a child if they can't get their shit together. \n\nAlso, lol the KID is biting the DOGS?", "move.. don't move to the luxury place yet, move to a normal one.. or to a professional house share or something. \nit's not going to get better if you stay", "NTA \n\nJ is your niece, not your daughter, so you shouldn\u2019t be expected to do so much. It was the parents who created the kid, so why is she your burden to bear? *She isn\u2019t*. \n\nBeing quiet because she\u2019s asleep, I can get behind. That\u2019s basic courtesy. But everything else you \u201chave\u201d to do isn\u2019t. If they moved out, there would only be the two of them to raise her, discipline her etc. So why they think that because you live in the same house you should be her third parent, is beyond me. \n\nBut as much as they can move out, so can you. I know you say you\u2019re saving for a place, and are living with them whilst doing so. But your relationship with your family is taking a bit because of it. You\u2019re expected to basically help raise your niece because you\u2019re there. Is that really worth it? Is it time you moved out to save the relationship with your family, as well as your own sanity? \n\nYou say that once you move out, you\u2019ll go NC because of it all. And if that\u2019s what you truly want to do, then nobody can stop you. But have you stopped to think that once you move out, things could improve with your family?", "NTA\nNot your kid, not your problem. The little monster bites the poor dog?! Hope doggo bites back. I would honestly just do what you want because at the end of the day your sister and her husband don\u2019t own the house, if you want to wake up late, wake up late if you wanna go out, go out there not your parents.", "NTA but start telling them no and your schedule is NOT their business. It doesn\u2019t matter when you\u2019re going out. Your sister can deal with her own kid. You are biding your time until August, but use this last bit to learn to say no and once you\u2019re out and go NC \u2026 they should already know why. You are not the bad guy. Not your circus, not your monkey.", "Not your kid so of course NTA, but really, just move the fuck out. It's not worth the saving.", "Try to avoid them, move out when you can and go NC", "NTA. Helping around the house and staying quiet at naptime are both common courtesies. Beyond that, your sister is manipulative and being unfair to everyone around her. She should parent her child, you should be cool uncle (with occasional scolding when she bites the dog, because she needs to respect authority, as one would in the village).\n\nMove out in August. Don't go no contact unless they start harassing you for not being there to raise her. No use burning bridges, and your niece will miss you.", "NTA. You\u2019re in a very unfair situation and your parents aren\u2019t considering your feelings nearly enough. That hurts and I\u2019m sorry. Chin up. I\u2019m NC with my parents and I\u2019ve never regretted it once. Good luck and big hugs", "I feel bad for the dog.  I guarantee that it will be put down when it has enough and growls or bites the child.\n\nNTA", "In all this, I feel only the parents/grandparents can complain. They have two grown ass kids moving into their home for their own gain (the luxury condo one, the never ending childcare the other). \nYou ESH here! Move out!!!", "NTA but this will go on until you move out.  They are not going to let it go but you are totally within your rights to keep standing up for yourself.", "NTA, but you are free to leave. Your niece is only 2 years old. She doesn\u2019t sound that out of control. She lives there too so you can\u2019t just ignore her. Best just to move out.", "NTA\n\nNot your kid, not your problem.\n\nYou are either going to accept that by not helping you are going to be portrayed as the selfish AH. I myself would be fine with that, I'm not helping with someone else's kid.\n\nNow if you don't want to be portrayed as the AH, you are going to have to suck it up and help until you move out.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s sound like you don\u2019t like the kid, which is perfectly fine and normal. We don\u2019t like everyone in our family.\n\nBut it\u2019s her child, when she decided to have she should have consider raising kid on her own, not expecting it from family. She should have consider that she may need a babysitter as her family has every right to say no. It\u2019s her child, it is part of family, but if you don\u2019t want to help every day - it\u2019s not your responsibility.", "NTA. It's true that it takes a village to raise a child, but you're also right that an unwilling village won't do the kid any good. It sucks that you're basically stuck raising a kid you didn't ask for since her actual father is only around when she's asleep and her mother apparently can't do her morning routine alone? What was the plan if they did get that loan they wanted? Have other people move in with them to help out?\n\nStart getting your ducks in a row to move out. Maybe consider a downgrade from that luxury downtown apartment to be out the door sooner. You're an adult and capable of making your own decisions, and you can absolutely decide you don't want to raise a child that's not yours.", "NTA. I'd have been long gone.", "YTA for way too many irrelevant details and not understanding your situation. Your story is basically \"I am a working adult living with my parents and extended family to save money. They expect me to do things that i don't like and they expect me to arrange some of my life to accommodate them. AITA?\" Are you really too slow to understand that this is not an ethical dilemma. Only YOU can decide whether free lodging is worth the hassles and expectations that come from living in a home with extended family.", "YTA \n\nNot because you don't want to help with the kid, but because you are an adult choosing to live in a situation where the household you are living with expects a certain level of cooperation.  \n\nYou don't want to do it, fine.  Then leave.  Now, not when the luxury apartment you want is available.  That is your option.  Your parents expect your cooperation as long as you choose to remain under their roof.  You don't like it so leave.", "Your sister is an AH! If i was you I\u2019d just find a place with a Roomate until u save up enough to get the apartment you want. Your sister is manipulating and rude and you help out and have changed your life ALOT to cater to their little family. You need to have a sit down talk with ur parents, out of the house, and let them know u love ur niece and ur sister, but you are an adult and have your own life, and that you really don\u2019t want this to ruin the relationship you have with them. If they still continue to make you the bad guy, then at least you know you did the right thing and tried to fix things.

It's ok to help out with your niece if it's when they ask you to because they're busy with work or just need a power nap and such but not just because it takes a village.

I hate hearing parents say those things. It's her kid, she can't expect everyone else to want to help.

Renters often tell horror stories (listed below) and owners pay expensive HOA fees that cut into their equity.\n\nI recommend you reconsider getting a cheaper place in one of the more walkable neighborhoods. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to dunk on your choices, I just want to share my experience. You do you! \n\nWhy I wound avoid renting in a Chicago high rise apartment building: \n1- rent only properties often operate entire floors as hotels, and rent out the amenities facilities to on residents. People are in and out with no courtesy for permanent residents. Also if your main reason for wanting this type of residence is the security, the additional turnover from short term rentals can defeat the purpose \n2- location isn\u2019t great for a social life, most of your peers tend to live and play in the trendy neighborhoods. You will end up paying high rent on top of Ubers on weekends - you can take the CTA (it\u2019s not as bad as ppl say it is) however weekend CTA operates fewer buses and trains. Better to have a more reliable CTA commute to the office on weekdays then spending time in the dark and cold waiting on train/bus weekends. \n3- you live in the Midwest, you know a winter social life is like, do you really want to spend that in a shoebox? This advice also applies to introverts. You are still stuck inside. \n4- gym facilities are better at actual gyms, and you can afford a membership with the money you save. Also most companies will give you cash back or a discount to join one. As far as I know this won\u2019t apply to a gym included in rent.\n5- the neighborhoods are vibrant and unique, allowing you to find a community anywhere in Chicago, but the downtown area is corporate and cold. \n\nThat said, the skyline is real pretty at night and those buildings have wonderful views of it. So I get the appeal. :) \n\nPlease note that I didn\u2019t mention crime at all. Because Chicago doesn\u2019t rank in the top 20 for violent crime in the US according to FBI.", "Nta. Your an uncle not the parent. Both of J\u2019s parents are more than capable, they just want free child care it seems. Stay your ground", "YTA.

I've lived in Chicago and I'm telling you now it gets pricey as hell. You may want to get an apartment in the suburbs instead, it's cheaper in the burbs and there's more options for lower cost groceries stores, restaurants etc. The glitz of the city wears off fairly quickly.", " they will give up asking you or you move out.", "NTA- you don\u2019t like them, the kid has nothing to do with it lol", "ESH sounds like you should just get your own place for now. If part of your parents arrangement for you living with them is that you help out where they deem necessary, you don\u2019t have much of a leg to stand on imo. \n\nThe apartment doesn\u2019t need to be luxury, just having your own space seems to be what you need", "ESH - you are living in the same houses as a toddler of two to save money and a lot of this is just what you expect with a child of that age. Restless nights,mess and noisy tantrums. Keeping noise low after 9pm reasonable enough unless you do want a screaming, tired toddler next day. \n\nBut unfair to expect you to look after the child and schedule your evenings a week out. You aren't a paid babysitter - what happens when your parents want out? And your sister is a AH to accuse you of hating the child because you don't want to babysit. And your parents as well for not wanting to rock the boat. It is easier to tell you what to do than her as bet she uses same manipulation on them.\n\nI'd move out as soon as you can but would consider not going NC with parents as they aren't in a great place either and patience must be thin. Three adults and a toddler under their roof when in retirement must be stressful.", "ESH\n\nyou aren\u2019t exactly responsible for much care here. Doing a few dishes of a 2 year old?

If that's with a roommate/other friends that is a better alternative than what you're dealing with now.\n\nI cannot stand when people bring children into the world without serious thought and consideration concerning whether they can afford to have them. By affording children, that isn't just in the monetary sense. I mean, can you handle all responsibility for that kid's mental, emotional, and physical needs on your own without expecting other people to do anything at all?", "ESH. You definitely shouldn\u2019t be expected to babysit or help out with someone else\u2019s kid, but holy fuck do you come across as an entitled brat. \n\nYou\u2019re living with your parents (rent free?) to save up money, and act like \u201chelping around the house\u201d occasionally is a favour to them. You\u2019re an adult and you live there, they shouldn\u2019t have to ask you to do your share of the housework. Same goes for \u201chelping\u201d with bills. That isn\u2019t a favour you\u2019re doing for them, those are YOUR bills. The months where you don\u2019t \u201chelp out\u201d is them doing you a favour, not the other way around. \n\nWhat you describe as \u201cbasically doing everything to raise her kid\u201d is occasionally cleaning up a mess she made or washing some dishes (in a house where you also live). Once again, that\u2019s not an unreasonable expectation. Living with other people means sometimes washing a plate you didn\u2019t eat off of. You shouldn\u2019t have to ALWAYS clean up if the kid is trashing the place, but wiping up a few juice spills or cheerios isn\u2019t exactly a lot to ask of an adult with a full time job living in the house. You act as if your sister and her family are invading your space, but they\u2019re her parents too. She has as much right to the house as you do, so maybe YOU should be the one to move out if there\u2019s a problem. \n\nAs far as \u201cnot being allowed to play music after 9\u201d or being woken up at night: again, move out. Toddlers don\u2019t always sleep through the night, as long as the parents are trying to keep the disturbance to a minimum you just need to deal with it. Get your own place, you won\u2019t need to tell anyone where you\u2019re going and you can play music as late as you want.", "ESH\n\nShe's a baby. Babies gonna baby.\n\nBut, FWIW, you could have moved out already. There's way more to Chicago than the $3000 one-bedrooms downtown.", "**NTA for like, 80% of it.**\n\nThe general assistance of the household which you live in and no noise after certain times is part of living with other people. This includes occupying a building with other tenants (presuming your future apartment is in a high rise/condo). You won't be able to play loud music in your apartment late or you'll be getting complaints and some angry knocks. You have to make sure all the dishes get done (whether they were yours or not) or you'll get vermin, which may go to neighboring units. You admit that living with your parents rent-free is beneficial to you. Helping pick up the slack of all the household dishes on occasion, etc. is not an insane expectation of the other occupants. I'm sure they've done your dishes before or cooked you a meal. When was the last time you scrubbed the baseboards? Re-caulked the tub? *Asking to contribute where you live for free is not the burden you are making it out to be, and living on your own is not the free-for-all, ideal haven you imagine it to be*. We live in society. We all have to contribute.\n\nHowever, you absolutely shouldn't be tasked with helping raise/parent your niece. Your example of \"helping in the morning\" is a bit vague, so I would need further detail before I can fully be on your side. I would wager that your sister and BIL could likely afford their own place and instead are remaining there as a way to get free childcare assistance. Perhaps an acceptable position of the grandparents, but not you.\n\nI hope that you moving out will re-instate your \"fun uncle\" status and your relationships can begin to repair.\n\nEdit: clarification.", "NTA. People will hate me saying this but J will learn when the dogs bite her back for biting them.", "NTA.  It sounds like you're doing enough as it is.  You didn't sign up to be a parent, so why are they expecting you to be one?  Get out as fast as you can!", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have to help with their kid in the morning.\n\nEverything else is just a complaint about living with other people. Move out. You clearly have the funds. And get over yourself.", "They make you wake up to take care of the kid in the morning? Damn they got you whipped, they chose to have a kid not you. Just start saying NO. NTA", "Sit your parents down amd tell them that you will nit be walimg up early or avoiding going out due to J. Your sis wanted a kid? She parents it. Go get a cheap room to rent, that will let you live your life and save for that luxury apt.\n\nNTA", "ESH.  This is what happens when too many adults (and their spouses and kids) stay under the same roof.   You are incompatible roommates.  Your parents see contributing to the household as part of the deal for you living there.  This, to them, includes tasks associated with J.   Perhaps it\u2019s time you find a new village.", "NTA i have 8 neices and nephews. I only babysat 2 of them. Cause they played fun games and id get paid 50 bucks and we'd also get extra money to ride bikes to the lolly shop it was sick haha None of the others wanted to pay that much so i just didnt babysit for them lmao i was lord business. You gotta be the same man just say no im not doing that shit. People like that can smell when you cant say no and use it.", "Nta. There\u2019s four other adults in that house who can take care of J.", "\u201cEither accept my help or not. Don\u2019t tell me how to parent your child if you aren\u2019t going to do it\u201d", "I agree.  The poor parents have 3 grown, employed adults living in their house and \"helping when they ask\", plus a toddler.  \n\nOP sounds extremely self centered, especially considering going NC with the people who have let him live there to save money for the \"luxury\" apartment.  Nothing OP mentioned sounded extreme, it's not like they are being asked to babysit the kid every day, and if OP doesn't like it, they can move out.", "Agreed. ESH. You are living in a shared house, you gotta work together.", "I mean he\u2019s also a grown as man living with his parents complaining about chores\u2026\n\nHe\u2019s not the father.  He should not be forced to care for a child that\u2019s not his.  He is free to leave at any time.", "Start making it clear now that your new home is a child-free space because I absolutely guarantee you that as soon as you move in they are going to be demanding you have your niece overnight because they're desperate for a decent night's sleep. Your home will become their cr\u00e8che every time they want some peace & quiet. If not already decided baby number 2 won't be far off so you'll be getting double the fun!", "I can\u2019t really understand. An entire assembled of adults fighting over entitlement rights. And then ghost the parents that kept everybody afloat.", "All of these things you're adding to make your sister seem worse really don't matter. It's not your house- the people who own the house are asking that you not play loud music. They are allowing you as a 23 year old able-bodied (I assume) person to live in their house without making any substantial contributions.  They are allowed to let your sister live there with her family.  If you don't like the situation- move out- no one is forcing you to live there. If you do want to stay- show some appreciation for your parents- suggestions: deep clean the kitchen without being asked,  cook a whole meal for the whole family,  do a load of laundry- like towels and sheets fully, vacuum, mop the floors. Stop being annoyed about your sister and her family and be grateful your parents let you stay there for free.", "Yeah sounds like he's setting himself up to be house poor.\n\nIf you need to save to rent an apartment, you can't afford that apartment.", "Believe it or not, someone can be your benefactor *and* do wrong by you.", "Agree. And when OP says that the parents are not disciplining the child enough, it's unclear to me if they never tell the kid no/stop etc., or the kid just hasn't stopped doing these things anyway. A two year old still needs to be told what not to do A LOT, and it's perfectly normal that they still do things that they are not supposed to do (although I hope she stops biting the dogs)."]}
