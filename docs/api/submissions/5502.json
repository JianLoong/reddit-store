Was not watching over her child.\n2. Was not watching over her pet.\n3. Did not teach her child how to properly hand the pet.\n4. Did not have pet insurance.", "NTA. What do they do with her when you are not around? She isn't regularly supervised when sleeping. \n\nAnd I am not sure how you can be proactive while sleeping. The expectation with responsible people (outside of parents) is that they are awake, not that they will wake up.", "NTA.  Yeah, that is unreasonable.  Unless you\u2019ve accepted responsibility for the kid at the time the thing happens and you\u2019re supposed to be actively watching them, responsibility for a kid\u2019s actions defaults to their parents.", "NTA. Her daughter, her dog, her responsibility. Who would she have blamed it on if you hadn't been there?", "You're the kid's aunt - it's not your fault the kid wasn't taught not to feed any chocolate to dogs. It's not your responsibility to keep an eye on her if her parents are around and you've not specifically agreed to do it. So it's not your fault for it happening, or your responsibility to pay for the fallout. NTA", "Nta. Whether you were there or not this would have happened. Would they have noticed if her bedroom was on the same floor as them ? Probably not. \n\nUnfortunately when a kids bedroom is downstairs away from the parents they can get into more things. This wasn't your fault.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault nor your responsibility to watch or parent the niece. Especially in the middle of the night when one would expect her to be asleep. You\u2019re not there as a babysitter but as a guest. I cannot fathom why a child who knows chocolate is bad for dogs would give a dog chocolate but then again mistakes are a great learning opportunity. I\u2019m glad the dog is ok but your sister is way out of line wanting you to pay the vet bill.", "NTA.\n\n\nYour sister is trying to take advantage of you. Don't allow it. If I were you, I'd pack and leave before getting blamed for something much worse.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your problem. You can\u2019t supervise when you\u2019re asleep - that\u2019s unreasonable, aside from if you even agreed to supervise in the first place, which it sounds like there was no expectation. Glad the dog will be okay.", "NTA. The title kind of made it sound like it was your chocolate or that you were somehow responsible for the dog's condition. Your sister needs to take accountability for her kid, as this would have happened regardless of whether or not you were visiting.", "NTA. Does your niece usually have an adult supervising while she sleeps? Why would your sister assign responsibility to you for the actions of her own child? \n\nThe sleeping arrangements are very bizarre. Why would the youngest child have the largest room on the ground floor while the parents have a room on a different floor along with the older child? Does your niece sleep walk?", "Wow, unreal. NTA. Train your kid, sister. Or get pet insurance cause come on, they kids!", "NTA.\n\nIf the reasons she would have asked was a genuine cry for financial help it would be a diff\u00e9rent story. But blame shifting is a dickmove.", "NTA. You were asleep and had nothing to do with the chocolates", "NTA, she is just pissed at the situation and wants someone else to share the burden of dealing with the consequences of her child\u2019s actions\u2026 it doesn\u2019t work like that unfortunately. If only they had some sort of insurance\u2026 for when accidental things happened to pets to help cover the costs of their medical care? (Oh, wait they do! Is it also somehow your fault she doesn\u2019t have pet insurance too? At this point who knows what she believes because she is clearly playing fast and loose with what is and isn\u2019t rational behaviour at this point).\n\nEven if you did hear your niece wake up, what if she was just going to the bathroom or getting a glass of water? This is 100000% not at all your fault. Don\u2019t entertain this request.", "Nta the son is responsability of the parents", "NTA. Your sister should have explained her kid exactly what happens if dogs eat chocolate. How can this be your fault?!", "NTA - A totally unreasonable demand.  Their kid and  dog.  Their responsibility to keep chocolate somewhere that their daughter can not access it.  And, watch the kid.  You are not responsible.", "So it's somehow your fault that her daughter fed her dog her chocolates? OK...\n\nObviously NTA.", "NTA - her kid, her dog, her responsibility. She\u2019s likely trying to find a way to perform some mental gymnastics so she can avoid blaming her kid and place that blame somewhere else (you).\n\nFirst thought: **Why in the world is the youngest kid sleeping alone on the ground floor that far from her parents??** That\u2019s a big parenting failure if I\u2019ve seen one. You shouldn\u2019t leave your youngest kid that unattended throughout the night, especially when they can *sneak out of their room to grab sweets and feed chocolate to the dog*. Why not give the bigger room to the older daughter, assuming she\u2019s less in need of monitoring than obviously the younger daughter is?\n\n> She accused me of making excuses and that as a nearby responsible adult I need to be more proactive??\n\nSo in your sister\u2019s eyes\u2026you should have not slept at all and been on alert as an overnight babysitter to make sure her kid didn\u2019t happen to misbehave? Which of course I assume your sister does when you aren\u2019t there. /s \n\nYour sister needs to look up what the word proactive means, or you should ask what she wanted you to do \u201cproactively\u201d here\u2026 Should you have tied your niece to her bed to prevent her from getting up at night? Barricaded the door to the room? Thrown out all the food in the house so your niece doesn\u2019t get tempted for a midnight snack and potentially feeds something poisonous to the dog?\n\nAll the sympathies to the poor pup, but your sister needs a major reality check here. I\u2019d likely look at staying elsewhere if you can.", "NTA\n\nNot your dog, not your child.", "Hahahaha NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Perhaps your sister should recoup the money from your niece's allowance. Kill 2 birds with one stone (getting money back and teaching the child that there are consequences to actions).", "NTA.  Help financially if you want because you want to help the sister.\n\nThe reality is as you state.  Her kid fed the dog chocolate.  If you hadn\u2019t been there, her kid would have fed the dog chocolate.  It wasn\u2019t chocolate you left out.  Ideally, you would have woken up and discerned what was happening and stopped it.

Emphasis on no chocolate for dogs.", "My 4 year old nephew came from school one day saying cats and dogs shouldn't be given chocolate. He learned about it during Easter.

Therefore, mom and dad should be the only ones footing the bill. OP had nothing to do with it."]}
