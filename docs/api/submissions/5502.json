It only takes a few minutes for a kid to feed an animal something they shouldn\u2019t.

You didn\u2019t leave the chocolate out/in reach of the child or dog, and you weren\u2019t the one responsible for teaching their kid that some people food is not ok for dogs. That\u2019s all on them. All you did was stay asleep, at night, when there was no reasonable expectation of you watching their kid.", "NTA", "NTA at all. I would be appalled if one of my sisters tried to pull this on me.", "NTA \n\nThat is not a reasonable expectation whatsoever.", "NTA\n\nNot your child, not your responsibility. \n\nIf you were being paid as an overnight caretaker then yes, you would be responsible for watching over the child as she sleeps. \n\nBut you\u2019re not. You\u2019re a guest who was sleeping. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely unreasonable to ask you to pay for something her own child did. You bare none of the responsibility even if you WERE sharing a room with the child.", "Sister is TA for even asking.  Kids run up all kinds of expenses on parents.", "NTA that\u2019s not your responsibility she just wants someone to blame", "NTA. Just massive NTA", "NTA", "How on earth would this be your fault? NTA. And I'd very highly recommend showing your sister how many people think she's being totally unreasonable.", "Umm, _WHAT_ ? You're \"responsible\" for sleeping through a child sneaking chocolate in HER house and giving some to a dog you had NO reason to be monitoring? How does that even make sense?! Sis is just broke and feeling daunted by having to pay the vet bill for HER failure to 1. _Secure the chocolate!_ , 2. Monitor HER child.\n\nNTA. At all. Don't pay a dime.", "LMAO, NTA, this is some of the most F\u2019d up logic I\u2019ve ever heard. This could have happened any night when you were not there, none of this is your responsibility.", "So if this same exact situation had happened and you WEREN\u2019T there, who would she have blamed then?\n\nNTA. Clearly she needs a baby monitor for her own child 24/7 period. She can\u2019t expect a GUEST to watch her child.", "NTA if she thinks her young daughter needs an adult to pay attention at all times she should still be sleeping in the parents room and not downstairs. Just seems a bit odd", "It was her child\u2019s fault and hers \ud83d\ude02 NTA you\u2019re sister is a fucking nut job!", "NTA. I was waiting to read a story about how you left your chocolate out or were irresponsible for how you stored your chocolate and their dog got into it, but no..... It's a story about your sisters kid knowing chocolate was bad for dogs and your sisters kid feeding chocolate to the dog anyway. This has nothing to do with you and everything to do with your sister trying to blame everyone but her daughter so she has someone to pin the financial bill on. Tell your sister to take responsibility for her KID because this situation has nothing to do with you. The only AH here is your sister for trying to pin responsibility on you so she can pin the bill on you.", "NTA. Unless we\u2019re missing something she\u2019s being beyond unreasonable and actually venturing boldly into the crazy zone.", "NTA.  She's the parent, she should have explained that chocolate is deadly to dogs and not that it was just bad.", "NTA", "NTA your sister is really grasping at straws here. You owe her nothing", "NTA. Among other reasons, your sister and her husband are the assholes for having a 7 yr old\u2019s bedroom downstairs. They should have that bedroom and their daughter should be upstairs with your other niece.", "Nta who leaves chocolate or candy in an area a child can reach it. Also not your dog", "NTA, your sister is being unreasonable.  Perhaps it\u2019s time to reconsider the decision to have a 7 yo on the ground floor, unsupervised.", "NTA", "NTA... wow, what a stretch to divert blame\n \nYou are not remotely responsible for your nieces actions", "It's not your fault. Niece is the absolute AH.\nNTA", "Nta that is some Olympic mental gymnastics there.  She wants you to pay bc her kid did something stupid??", "MTA This is like saying if you see a car crash then you need to pay the deductible.", "NTA. It would have happened whether or not you were there. She would have been alone downstairs anyhow.", "\"As a non parent in charge of no children while we're sleeping upstairs not parenting we demand you help pay a bill that our lovely little, and possibly, more than likely, sociopathic little shit caused by knowingly feeding nummy chocolate poison to our dog while sneaking out of bed at some point between the hours of 9pm and 5am. Its only fucking fair that you take it up the ass because we're totally to fucking cheap to pay for pet insurance.\"\n\nDid I miss anything?\n\nOh, yeah,  N T A", "NTA and tell her to stop reaching!  You are the guest, not the defacto babysitter!  She should ultimately be watching her child.", "NTA\n\nThat is some interesting reasoning by your sister. No you don't owe a dime none of this is your fault by any stretch of (your sister's) the imagination. I know where I wouldn't stay again however. \n\nWho keeps an eye on your niece when you aren't there?", "op=NTA\n\nlet me see\n\n1) not your home\n\n2) not your chocolate(and you don't appear to have gifted it to your sister)\n\n3) not your kid\n\n4) not your dog\n\n5) sleeping-no agreement to be \"babysitting/watching child at time\n\nConclusion, your sister is nuttier than a Walnut tree.", "NTA. She's projecting onto you. My kids have very much done dumb shit like this when we have company. Never have I ever asked the company to pay for repairs/replacements nor have I had the audacity to blame them. I cannot follow the logic she is trying to use here because there is none. And like you said, it's not like you were babysitting the kid, parents just don't wanna take responsibility for the fact that their kid almost seriously injured their dog.", "This is stupid. How is this even a question. You didn\u2019t wake up. It\u2019s not like you did wake up and then did nothing. NTA", "NTA. But since she's hosting you and presumably paying for groceries, I would give her some room and board money instead", "5. Left the chocolates in a readily available place. NTA.", "5. Why would they put a 7 year old kid who gets the biggest room and alone, while the rest of the family\u2019s stayed upstairs?", "First thought for me was: why is youngest kid's room the furthest away from the parents? That makes zero sense to me.", "Don't forget that sister failed to put chocolate in a place where the child couldn't get it. (Yes I get this can be difficult, but it's still the sister's responsibility.)", "NTA. Yeah, that is unreasonable.", "All of this plus,  the mother of the child left the chocolates out to begin with.  Also what are the chances that this was the first time this child got up on her own during the night?", "Also her chocolate.", "Or that OP left the chocolate where the dog could reach it, OPs chocolate. Literally none of this is OPs fault. This is all the parents and the younger niece.", "I see no reasonable grounds for the OP to be responsible for a cent of the vet bill.", "I had a whomping big old dog.  The only way to keep food inaccessible to her was to put it on top of the fridge or behind locked doors because the crafty bugger figured out how to open cabinets.\n\nI had to baby-proof my house for a very clever dog.\n\nOP owes NOTHING and is NTA.", "Also did not teach a 7 year old to not feed chocolates to a dog!", "Yeah I had to re-read that twice. Parenting 101 is that you don't leave a young child downstairs alone at night. That's  where hot stoves and doors to outside and windows that can get broken into all live. Like you, I would have taken the downstairs room and put the kids upstairs.", "These parents already sound bloody mad as hell to me. So I'm not surprised they lack basic human thought process", "Let's not forget it's also the owner's chocolate. They should have secured in a place that was not easily accessible.", "Hey man these parents are already mad to expect OP to pay a cent on that bill. So don't be surprised they lack basic human thought process", "I know. I read f7 as 17 too.", "But that's a failure of her parents to explain what they meant by \"bad.\" It's yet another failure of your sister's. She's fully responsible for this happening and it's surprising it didn't happen before now.", "We had a Cane Corso who learned how to open the refrigerator! (It took me a day or two to figure out where the food was going, luckily he didn't get anything dangerous...just left over chicken breasts.) I had a dish towel through the door handle and Squirt figured out how to pull on it to open the door. I miss that dog\ud83d\ude14", "100% true, you have to baby proof a home for a pet, even then sometimes it doesn't help. My husband used to have a dog that was smart enough to remove anything baby proof he could, we currently have two cats and its the same thing.\n\n NTA on the sister when it's her responsibility", "I'm lucky that out of three dogs my parents adopted 1 was too well behaved to steal food and 2 were incredibly dumb. So if you put food in one of the higher cabinets, it was safe. I get it's not like that with a lot of dogs, but we got lucky in terms of their ability to get into food that would make them sick.", "Especially since she apparently obviously had the bigger room?? Personally, as the parent, I want the bigger room because I'd have to share it. But the logistics of keeping a child downstairs by themselves at night blows my mind.", "I didn't notice an age for the older niece, but if she's a teen, giving her the downstairs bedroom could give her a little privacy and then having the parents and younger niece on the top floor means the parents are more accessible if younger niece has an issue.", "Good point", "Hye man these parents are already bloody (bad word that might get me banned) so I'm not surprised", "Maybe it's my misspent youth but all I can imagine with a teen alone downstairs is a lot of sneaking out at night.", "By 7 my daughter knew the 5 different species of animals we have and what each one can and can't hleat. Like, we don't feed chicken scraps to chickens and how to spot mouldy hay when feeding horses, how to mix formula for a bottle fed calf and the dangers of chocolate, onions, grapes etc for dogs. It does seem like there has been a significant breakdown in communication if this child doesn't understand the severity of chocolate and dogs.", "I grew up with a dog and knew not to feed her human food. People act like it's impossible to teach kids this, but I had mastered it when I was younger than five."]}
