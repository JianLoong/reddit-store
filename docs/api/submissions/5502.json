It only takes a few minutes for a kid to feed an animal something they shouldn\u2019t.

None of this would have been different if you hadn't been there.", "NTA. She is trying to take advantage of you. She\u2019s old enough to know better.", "NTA\n\n\nYou had nothing to do with it. And it would have happened even if you weren't there!\n\n\nBlaming you is wrong. As an adult wtf would you allow the youngest child to sleep downstairs alone like that?? That's a critical error on there part.", "NTA.  Some light sleepers legitimately don't seem to think other people can truly stay unconscious.  They act like we're waking up to every sound but going back to sleep without opening our eyes.  I don't get it.  But there's no way to watch someone while you're asleep.  NTA", "Nta. Kids are stupid at the best of times. She chose to have kids and keep the youngest down stairs which boggles my mind... my 7yr old always always tries to sneak treats when I'm asleep. Lucky she isn't too quiet haha", "NTA\n\nYou aren't responsible for your niece. Your sister and her husband is. Now she's trying to get money out of you because SHE failed in her responsibilities.", "NTA.  This could have happened regardless of you visiting.  Your youngest niece should not be sleeping on the main floor anyway. The parents should be.  You are not responsible for what your niece did. You're not staying there to be a hall monitor for your 7yr old niece.", "NTA and also, why have the youngest in a bedroom on a floor by herself, this could EASILY have happened even if you weren\u2019t there.", "No this is absolutely crazy. NTA x 10,000", "NTA. Not your dog, not your kid, not your chocolate, not your house, not your problem.", "NTA - Is your sister ok mentally?  This makes zero sense.  It's nowhere near logical to expect you to be responsible for her daughter's actions. \n\nWho would she have blamed it on if you weren't there?  Probably you for not being there to stop her daughter.", "nta. you were there as a guest not a babysitter. tell her it's her fault for not teaching her kids not to feed dogs chocolate and how bad it is for them.", "NTA.  So, your sister and husband let your 7yr old niece sleep downstairs by herself while they sleep upstairs - what could go wrong?\n\nThis isn't your fault or issue - certainly not where you should be bearing some of the financial responsibility.\n\nIf you hadn't been visiting - would anything had been different?  No, your niece would have still gotten up, eat some chocolate and gave some to the dogs - all while her parents slept upstairs.\n\nIt is totally unreasonably for your sister to try to put some of the blame on you for this.", "Her kid, her house but your responsability? She should have educated her kid in the first place.", "NTA. Your sister is nuts.", "NTA, sounds like she\u2019s stressed and needs a scapegoat to yell at/help her because she can\u2019t afford to or doesn\u2019t want to by herself", "A couple pieces of chocolate would not really do a lot of damage- esp if milk chocolate. I am surprised vet even had dog some in. We are usually told feed them activated charcoal.", "Nta. Who watches the niece when you aren\u2019t there?", "Unless you were awake, standing right there with your niece as she gave the dog chocolate, and then failed to do anything in that moment, you are not responsible for any part of this event.  You were not in the room, so your sister is fully responsible for every part of what happened.  NTA", "NTA she is clearly blame shifting.  her children her dog and her chocolate (that she left out) are none of your fault.", "Oh good grief. That\u2019s a mighty stretch that it\u2019s somehow the OP\u2019s fault that her daughter fed her dog chocolates and made him sick in the middle of the night and OP should have woken up from a sound sleep and stopped it. That\u2019s some Mr. Spock level logic at work right there.", "So your niece, while in her home with both of her parents, got up in the middle of the night and fed the dog chocolates that her mother left out of the cupboard. And in her mother's mind this is somehow partially your fault? Yeah, that's some serious mental gymnastics.\n\nNTA", "lol what?  Her kid fed her chocolate to her dog in her house.  It\u2019s got nothing to do with you. Nta", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised that the dog got sick. My dog got into Halloween candy. Probably ate about a dozen little candy bars with the wrapper on. She barfed them up but was otherwise fine. It\u2019s a testament to how little cocoa is actually in \u201cchocolate\u201d these days. \n\nEither way, it\u2019s not your problem.", "Oh hell no", "She left the chocolates out.", "Exactly! The dog and the child were both literally nothing to do with op as neither of them were her responsibility. Why did her sister not wake up and notice that her kid was feeding the dog chocolate?", "OP, your sister is being ridiculous. SHE is the child's parent and SHE didn't hear the kid get up and give the dog chocolate. If the child needs to be watched 24/7, she should be upstairs, close to her parents. Her sister has ZERO justification to be mad at you.", "I expected OP to have left the chocolate on the dog\u2019s bed.", "Does OP even know how much the will was? Was she shown the bill? How much is too much?", "This sub is fucking hilarious.\n\n\nThe sister is definitely the brainless AH but to actually type out \"this is now an unsafe situation for you\", with zero evidence? Add it to the pile of WILD speculation the sub regularly creates. Turn off the soap operas.", "Coated it in peanut butter to make sure the dog takes it.", "Very odd! The whole setup seems unsafe and bizzare. Also you leave your 7 year old alone with the dog, when clearly she can\u2019t even take enough not to harm him.", "to me, that's excessive paranoia.\n\nWhy not wrap your kid in bubble wrap if that much shit scares you?", "My DILs nephew sleeps on bottom floor because he sleep walks.", "Except you can easily get a rollup fire ladder for first or second floors that attaches to the window...", "I got my dog months after my first nephew was born.. he's now 8 and has 3 other siblings.  From early early in they've all learned the things dogs can't eat and can recite it back.. and the youngest is 2.", "The only way I\u2019m paying is if I shoved it in a Kong. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. It\u2019s obviously not your fault that the dog ate the chocolate. You were asleep. Were you supposed to smell the chocolate in your sleep, and while sleeping, know that your niece was feeding the dog chocolate, she knowing full well that it was bad for the dog? Not your circus, not your monkey. I\u2019m sure the vet can put your sister on a payment plan.", "NTA. Not your circus, so not your problem.  It's outrageous for your sister to suggest you are in any way responsible.", "NTA - HER kid fed HER dog while in HER house. This has absolutely nothing to do with you.", "\u201cMy child is a moron, please pay for the consequences because you were here while she was being a moron\u201d\n\nNTA, and your sister kinda sucks.", "Her child, her dog, her responsibility. You sister is super entitled to demand money from you over problems entirely under her responsibility. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. This would have likely happened whether you were there or not.", "Who left chocolate in a place where a kid could find it and feed it to a dog? \nWHO HASN'T TRAINED THEIR 7 YEAR OLD NOT TO FEED DOGS CHOCOLATE?  I think you should feel bad that you didn't wake up, but not bad enough to pay. ESH except the dog.", "NTA, it would have happened if you were there or not. The chocolate should have been kept away better.", "NTA.  This makes zero sense.  I was waiting to read the dog got into your suitcase or you fed the dog chocolate.  WTF", "NTA- your sister just grasping at air, hoping, hopping, wishing on a star. You are not responsible, she is and don\u2019t you let anyone tell you otherwise.", "NTA. This is ridiculous.", "She says it's your fault for not waking up? Does she know how sleep works?\nNTA", "Nope", "Your sister is completely unreasonable, making demands out of thin air.  She's TA.  Her kid is her responsbility, as is the dog.  Sleep tight.  You happen to have a toxic family.", "They have their youngest in the downstairs bedroom with quick access to the kitchen and stuff? I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a no no. But under normal circumstances, this could also happen and they wouldn\u2019t know. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nNTA", "NTA - not your child, not your responsibility. Your sister left the chocolate on the table, and clearly hasn't taught her child how to properly deal with animals", "NTA This situation is wholly your niece's fault who was your sister's responsibility.", "Um NTA but you also didn't stay in a hotel so why wouldn't you just help out the fam if you are in a position to? Hotels are ridiculous this time of year. I would assume she means by you staying with them you would be helping not just taking up a bed, and she's upset about other stuff too. It's pretty unreasonable for her to think you should have woken up. So you're NTA but it's the holidays and I would help.", "NTA - this whole situation has absolutely nothing to do with you. It\u2019s a coincidence you where in the house at that time. She\u2019s not supervising her daughter. This would have happened even when you weren\u2019t there.", "Why is a child on the downstairs bedroom? That\u2019s the first level of entry for a home invasion- so unless she has a disability it\u2019s really not safe for her to be the one to sleep downstairs while her parents sleep upstairs. It\u2019s also a bit dumb that she has the biggest bedroom when that\u2019s obviously the master bedroom\u2014 which culturally makes sense since it\u2019s DUMB to put your 7 year old in a bedroom downstairs alone", "If you have a pet you should have a conscious fund for emergencies like this. NTA", "I... is American chocolate like... completely different to other chocolate?\n\nLike all my dogs have eaten chocolate for years and never been sick.\n\nAll these 'chocolate kills dogs' posts made me look it up years ago and it takes like 2kg of pure dark chocolate to kill a medium sized dog.\n\nYou're NTA but I do not get the 'one piece of chocolate straight to the vet' mentality.\n\n(And yes, I AM aware its poisonous because it takes ages to get out their system. My old dogs all lived to be 14+)", "I\u2019m also not seeing how this wouldn\u2019t have happened if she hadn\u2019t visited.  The kid was acting independently.", "5. Left the chocolates out", "5. Left chocolate out where her child could get it.", "5. Since no one else was watching her before you arrived,  she would have done it with or without you present. Who would she blame if it was done the night before? NTA and your sister knows it.", "She's 7. She shouldn't have to be supervised while sleeping. Parents didn't teach her better. My 7yo would be in so much trouble. But he also wouldn't do that because he knows the dog could get sick or die. Waking up at night happens. My kids all have trouble sleeping. They wake up and read a book for awhile. They don't get up and raid the cabinets for candy. \n\n His little sister(6) came home the other day with orbeez. I told the kids very plainly that if the dog eats one it would block her intestines and she would probably die (there is no emergency vet where we live), so do not leave them where she can get them. They immediately gathered them all up, double checked the carpet, and threw them away.", "Yes, chocolate poisoning is rarely fatal in most cases, but 2kg of dark chocolate to kill a medium dog is a huge exagerration, it would take a lot less than that!! \n\nPlease do not spread misinformation.", "AND the *biggest* room\n\nAlso glad it wasn\u2019t just me found this strange", "My dog learned the foot pedal on the trash can. We tried a hand waved sensor one as well. He would hover his nose over the sensor to make it open.", "She's 7, why is everyone acting like she's a toddler? My 7yo goes out and plays in the woods with his dog. He makes himself breakfast on weekends. And he definitely knows not to give the dog chocolate (though she's very big so it would take a lot of chocolate to actually harm her).", "Yeah how dare she not have spidey senses! That's the least she can do if she absolutely must take breaks to sleep. Doesn't she know it's her responsibility to stay up 24/7 and have xray vision to see through walls???? It's just common guest courtesy!\n\n\n\n/s", "Point 1: Her mother is blaming her sister-the 7 year old\u2019s aunt, for what her kid did, and aunt is only visiting and had nothing to do with it. \n\nPoint 2 and more importantly, abduction/kidnapping, break ins, assaults, murders, the 7 year old is alone downstairs while her parents and older sister are upstairs. Also, if the room is the biggest, I am baffled at why the parents don\u2019t sleep there.", "Or if not insurance, at least put money aside each month for emergencies.", "You want a 7 year old managing a fire ladder out a window by herself from a second story window? I\u2019m just saying if she\u2019s on the first floor she could walk herself right out the front door if her parents aren\u2019t able to get to her. From an upper floor it\u2019s harder.", "That's how I rationalized the situation. But like the other person replies,totally depends on the teen. I was alone as a lot growing up because my single mom worked nights. I only snuck out like... Once as a teenager. And even that was just to go see a movie with my BFF. And if I had asked I highly doubt Mom would have said no tbh. I just wanted to feel sneaky and rebellious. Lmao now I think about it she happened to call me on her break in the middle of that movie. She never said anything but I bet she did know"]}
