In both cases you are asleep! Here they had an adult *in the same room*. Do Redditors think kids under 10 should sleep in same room as their parents? Of course not.\n\nIn fact, since kid likely goes to bed earlier than rest of house, one could argue that you are maximizing supervision having kid in living spaces while they are sleeping because you are within earshot while you are awake.\n\nTo the person who is worried about the kid getting hurt first in a break-in: that\u2019s SUPER unlikely, and depending on layout of house not necessarily more likely anyway. But honestly, chances of this happening are astronomically small. This should not be a consideration when selecting bedrooms.\n\n The vast majority of kids over the age of about four do not need constant parental supervision even while parents are asleep and that idea is harmful (hello helicopter parenting). Those that do (Eg some autistic kids) need help so that they can take it in turns to be awake.\n\nUltimately the sister here is shifting blame because what happened sucked and she doesn\u2019t want to be furious at the kid. It\u2019s natural to want to find a scapegoat. A great parent would resist this impulse and instead focus on prevention. It only takes a few minutes for a kid to feed an animal something they shouldn\u2019t. Realistically I bet this could have happened at multiple points through the day when everyone was awake, not even because kid is inadequately supervised but because it\u2019s unrealistic and harmful to keep your kids under 24/7 surveillance. \n\nThis should be a cautionary tale about pets and not feeding them without parental ok, not about room placement.\n\nI agree that not having pet insurance is a choice. NTA, Op.", "If a household contains both dogs and kids, then the \"don't give human food to the dog\" rule should be explained to the kids as soon as they can understand, and the reasons for it. Other things to not feed dogs include grapes (and raisins). The parents need to explain to the kids why something that is a treat for a human is no go for a dog."]}
