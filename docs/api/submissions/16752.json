The hospital she works does not allow anyone (doctors, nurses etc) to wear makeup in the operating room. There are other rules like no nail polish or perfume too but makeup is the big one. Something about keeping the environment sterile. My sister said she isn't going to wear makeup on her wedding day. My wife offered to teach her or to do some light makeup on the day but my sister said no. She said she hasn't worn or owned makeup since she joined the armed forces and so she does not think she needs it for her wedding. \n\nI think my wife is right. Also my wife was pretty hurt when my sister said no. My wife pointed out that she might look washed out in the photos but my sister just said that besides her friend, our mom and my wife no one else at the wedding will be wearing makeup. Her fianc\u00e9, he isn't so she does not think she needs it. I think my wife is right and that my sister will regret it after the fact. My sister thinks we are wrong and it's causing friction between her and I now. I just don't want her to regret it later. She doesn't deserve that.

She was a full-time nurse in the armed forces from 2002-2012 and after she left the service she got a job as a surgical/operating room nurse. The hospital she works does not allow anyone (doctors, nurses etc) to wear makeup in the operating room. There are other rules like no nail polish or perfume too but makeup is the big one. Something about keeping the environment sterile. My sister said she isn't going to wear makeup on her wedding day. My wife offered to teach her or to do some light makeup on the day but my sister said no. She said she hasn't worn or owned makeup since she joined the armed forces and so she does not think she needs it for her wedding. \n\nI think my wife is right. Also my wife was pretty hurt when my sister said no. My wife pointed out that she might look washed out in the photos but my sister just said that besides her friend, our mom and my wife no one else at the wedding will be wearing makeup. Her fianc\u00e9 isn't so she does not think she needs it. I think my wife is right and that my sister will regret it after the fact. My sister thinks we are wrong and it's causing friction between her and I now. I just don't want her to regret it later. She doesn't deserve that.

I performed a very small wedding ceremony for friends a few years ago and looked the same as everyone, too. I did offer to wear some but the bride told me it wasn\u2019t necessary and she just wanted me to be comfortable. Some people just prefer to not wear makeup and don\u2019t care what other thing. And that\u2019s 100% acceptable!", "I used to work in a sterile lab, had to suit up in hazmat suits to enter clean rooms etc, maybe she works in something like that? We created vaccines where I worked so not surgery but we had the same rules to follow.", "I\u2019ve had a pretty similar situation. I had to get makeup done by a provided makeup artist and I can\u2019t even force myself to look at the pictures because it looked so bad.", "Because his wife looks like a \"painted lady\" and thinks everyone should be.", "I beg to differ. One recommendation from the brother is too many!", "If it was kind and well-intended, it would have stopped right there.", "It's the sister's wedding, not OPs!!! He is trying to make the bride do something she doesn't want to do for his wife's (a guest) feelings!", "As long as OP has his makeup done by the makeup crew of Ringling Brother.", "OP isn't volunteering to have his wife do his makeup. His sister hasn't offered to do makeup for the groom or any of the male guests. It's only his sister who is bearing the brunt and that is wrong. Why do the men get a pass but not OP's sister?", "You must be the wife.", "So because you liked how you looked like with makeup, everyone else has to like it too? As if people\u2019s comfort with makeup depends on the person themselves instead of nosey people?", "I have seen far too many brides with makeup that\u2019s wayyy too heavy on their wedding days because people insist to them it\u2019ll look better in the pictures. Meanwhile they look clownish to the people at the actual wedding. It\u2019s bizarre.", "I'm not someone who wears makeup. I'm not wearing it at my wedding for this reason. I want to look back at the photos and see myself - not someone else. Makeup changes how people look and my fiance and I are happy with how I look.", "They overdid my mother\u2019s makeup for my wedding and she doesn\u2019t look like herself.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t in an attention stealing way, it was just too drastic on someone who literally hadn\u2019t worn lipstick in twenty years and commented it was much lighter feeling than she remembered", "Yes they really should both apologize to her", "Understandable and good for you! Seriously glad you\u2019re wedding turned out great but coming from a military background I\u2019m fairly confident the sister knows what she\u2019s doing it\u2019s comfortable for her and that\u2019s how she wants to be. Besides editing is a thing so not all is lost.", "How do you know you wouldn\u2019t have looked amazing without the makeup? I\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy with your photos, truly, but its the brides choice not her brother or SIL.", "I get your POV but sister is very clear that she's not interested in makeup, so she probably doesn't care that much about the photos. Bro needs to sit back. And, yes, I wear makeup occasionally but not all the time (and only eye makeup--no rouge or foundation or anything like that. I feel like a clown if I wear lipstick).", "I didn't wear makeup at my wedding, and you know what I look like in the photos? Myself.", "As a photographer,  if you looked washed out just because you wore no makeup, you have a shitty photographer.", "It isn't about you \n\nIt's about the bride", "\"No\" is a full sentence and she's expressed her feelings on this topic several times. It's great that you appreciated being talked into wearing makeup for your wedding, but this isn't about you and it isn't about op and his wife. They've presented an idea. OPs has very clearly said it's not something she wants to do. Making a suggestion once is ok, but bringing it up again when a person has clearly said no is an AH move.", "That\u2019s you not her", "As a photographer, yeah, if no makeup makes them \"washed out\" they hired a shitty photographer", "It seems like you have some self-esteem issues to work through. You're all over these comments insisting women need to wear makeup.", "This take is dumb and stupid.", "It\u2019s not that men don\u2019t look washed out and women do, it\u2019s that there is such a lack of non-makeup wearing women that it makes those that don\u2019t wear any look washed out and out of place. \n\nPeople are so unaccustomed to seeing bare women that they can look odd. Especially if they\u2019re the only one among dozens. \n\nAny good photographer worth the money should be able to take beautiful pictures without anyone needing makeup.", "Sexism and misogyny on FULL display. Get lost.", "This is just not true,like at all. All the women AND men in my family have very strong features, since we are Polish/German by genetics. All of the women AND men in my wife's family have softer features, since they are British/Welsh by genetics. Men MAY have a stronger jawline or brow, but that is not necessarily true (as my brow and jawline are FAR stronger than any of the men in my wife's family, as that is the way of genetics). Furthermore, as a photographer, I say this is an outright lie. Nothing about \"stronger features\" would prevent washing out. You know what prevents washing out? A decent photographer that knows their way around lighting and editing. Not \"stronger features\" OR make-up.", "To be honest, if they're making the argument \"I cared so I said something\" then I get it. Like... they shouldn't have cared, and shouldn't have said anything. But at least it would look like a credible claim y'know?", "Doesn't matter unless she's the SISTER, aka THE BRIDE her opinion doesn't matter either, lol", "Hers was mild compared to some, but still more than the *zero* she wore day to day.\n\nWe're going to have another ceremony at the 5 or 10 year mark and redo pictures, I'd like her to enjoy how she looks.", "I had a professional do my hair and makeup for my wedding. Hair stylist was awesome, but makeup artist made me look like someone I didn't recognize. After she left, I washed my face and did my own.\n\nEdit: Typo", "It's like the MUA or whomever applies it uses a spackle. My friend's son got married a couple years ago and she asked me to go to the trial, the MUA disregarded her preferences and my friend looked like a right clown when she was done. She  told the woman she hated it and I agreed.", "My husband's niece had to re-blend my and my other bridesmaid's makeup because the professional we had do it caked the foundation on too thick... I normally don't ever wear makeup, and while I do like how it turned out, I'm lucky I had someone to fix it. I guess it's normal to do heavy make up for film cameras, but it's no longer needed with digital.", "I hope you enjoy your wedding and have a lovely partnership!", "More like she should ban them from the wedding.", "I just don\u2019t think OP did anything wrong.  Wife made a suggestion and feels a little let down that sister didn\u2019t accept it.  Okay?  They aren\u2019t hounding her about it or anything so far as I can tell.", "I wish I could upvote this a million times. Her wedding is about her and the person she\u2019s marrying; why tf would she want to look like someone else? Stop telling her she\u2019s not beautiful or good enough. Her partner thinks she is and she thinks she is and a metric fuck-ton of internet strangers think she is. \n\nYTA and so is your wife for the above alone; the astronomical misogyny is a whole other 747\u2019s worth of unclaimed baggage. And this is coming from someone whose annual makeup budget rivals their rent", "My best friend and I are pretty different in the way we choose to dress. For her wedding, she wore just a tiny bit of tinted moisturizer, for my wedding I had the whole shebang with a professional make up artist. We both fully supported each other's choices and we both looked fabulous on our days.", "I\u2019m answering the same question multiple times because apparently people don\u2019t know how to read and see that something\u2018s already been asked and answered.", "The brother was being \"caring\" after his wife had already been rude. So I stick by one comment from brother is one too many!", "Love this idea", "Actually, even though almost anything can be done with editing software digital cameras still use flash & it makes it easier on the person editing photos if they don't have to add color back in after the flash washes a person out.", "OP said it\u2019s causing friction between him and his sister.", "They are hounding her about it lol. Op is clearly putting his wife's feelings above his sisters, it's literally none of their business. There's no rule saying she has to wear makeup on her birthday so they shouldn't act like it.", "[removed]", "Yeah, they could be seeing it & disagree. Once is really enough, fyi.", "Did i ask for your opinion?"]}
