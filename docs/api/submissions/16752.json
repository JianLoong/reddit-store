She was a full-time nurse in the armed forces from 2002-2012 and after she left the service she got a job as a surgical/operating room nurse. The hospital she works does not allow anyone (doctors, nurses etc) to wear makeup in the operating room. There are other rules like no nail polish or perfume too but makeup is the big one. Something about keeping the environment sterile. My sister said she isn't going to wear makeup on her wedding day. My wife offered to teach her or to do some light makeup on the day but my sister said no. She said she hasn't worn or owned makeup since she joined the armed forces and so she does not think she needs it for her wedding. \n\nI think my wife is right. Also my wife was pretty hurt when my sister said no. My wife pointed out that she might look washed out in the photos but my sister just said that besides her friend, our mom and my wife no one else at the wedding will be wearing makeup. Her fianc\u00e9, he isn't so she does not think she needs it. I think my wife is right and that my sister will regret it after the fact. My sister thinks we are wrong and it's causing friction between her and I now. I just don't want her to regret it later. She doesn't deserve that.

She was a full-time nurse in the armed forces from 2002-2012 and after she left the service she got a job as a surgical/operating room nurse. The hospital she works does not allow anyone (doctors, nurses etc) to wear makeup in the operating room. There are other rules like no nail polish or perfume too but makeup is the big one. Something about keeping the environment sterile. My sister said she isn't going to wear makeup on her wedding day. My wife offered to teach her or to do some light makeup on the day but my sister said no. She said she hasn't worn or owned makeup since she joined the armed forces and so she does not think she needs it for her wedding. \n\nI think my wife is right. Also my wife was pretty hurt when my sister said no. My wife pointed out that she might look washed out in the photos but my sister just said that besides her friend, our mom and my wife no one else at the wedding will be wearing makeup. Her fianc\u00e9 isn't so she does not think she needs it. I think my wife is right and that my sister will regret it after the fact. My sister thinks we are wrong and it's causing friction between her and I now. I just don't want her to regret it later. She doesn't deserve that.

Photographers should be exposing the person not the dress though so I don\u2019t see how that would be a problem.", "Listen alr I'm asian and I still imagined white. This is white man's country, white man's language and the white man's land. If I was in Asia and talking to someone in a different language I'd imagine they look like me.", "Sounds like misogynists need to get used to seeing women\u2019s actual faces, then, so they\u2019re not so startled by it.", ">clearly you missed the part where i said the guys should wear makeup for wedding photos also\n\nProbably because it isn't there.\n\nOPs sister is also free to get married in overalls if she wants, I don't know where the inconsistency is there.\n\nShe WANTS to wear a dress, she DOES NOT WANT to wear makeup.", "Maybe that\u2019s the wife\u2019s fear. The photographer will adjust to the bride and the wife will look like an Oompa Loompa.\n\nI remember bei no hassled about wearing fake tan, which I never wear, to my wedding. Why would I want to look like a different person? I\u2019m pale like a ghosts, if that bothers someone that\u2019s a them problem.", "That, and... every actor on a set wears makeup, including men. Because the direct bright lights make everyone look washed out. Is OP's wife also insisting her fianc\u00e9 wear makeup, or is there internalized gender stereotypes playing into her pushiness? Willing to bet OP's wife's concern is less about looking washed out and more about the sister performing her gender role \"correctly.\"", "That was my biggest thing: the make up was just to enhance a few features. I explicitly told my hair/make up lady I wanted to still look like myself. Thankfully she did a wonderful job. I'm sorry your professional didn't do that. I don't get the idea of erasing what you look like just because it's your wedding.", "I mean OP literally said that SIL would look washed out. So it\u2019s not an assumption that they are of a skin tone that would look washed out.", "\u201cAll the comments saying \u2018you should wear makeup too, see how ridiculous you sound!!, uhhh no?? You should wear makeup when professional photography is involved!\u201d \n\nIt was literally the first sentence lmao fhhfjf good lord", "That sentence says literally nothing about guys needing to wear makeup too.\n\nWild how you thought that just making shit up would work.\n\nMisogyny isn't a good look on you.", "The husband. Is a guy. Comments are saying it would be ridiculous for men to wear makeup. I said its not ridiculous for him, the husband, to wear makeup. \n\nBro. Reading comprehension. Do you need every single thing spelled out in the simplest words? Why do many word when less word do trick, right? \n\nI get you wanna whiteknight for this bride, but if you knew anything about photography youd be seeing this wifes pov. Its her wedding and her choice, who cares what she does, except r/weddingshaming i guess, but acting like saying \u201chey for pro photos you might want concealer for dark circles so you dont have to spend hundreds/thousands on an already price gouged photography industry\u201d is misogyny is SUCH a reach.", ">Its her wedding and her choice\n\nFull stop.\n\nBut you want to control her wedding and shame her choice.\n\nScreams misogyny.\n\nTagging a subreddit where people are regularly misogynistic is hilarious btw, I'm glad so many of them are hyperfocused on brides."]}
