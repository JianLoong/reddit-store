We've started the conversation about college with our parents. I have very clear goals of where I want to go to college and what I want to do. I have stellar grades and test scores and my dream school is an ivy that I think I can get into with good aid. While neither of us had very good opportunities for extracurriculars, even now, I'm trying my hardest to give me something to beef up my applications. I know exactly what I want to major in and have been planning this since I started highschool. \n\nMy sister is the exact opposite. She isn't very school orientated, She takes only regular classes but generally passes them. Her testing scores were fairly low and she doesnt do any extracurriculars. All this to say, the colleges I want to go to are not even an option for her.I worry that she's not going to get any good scholarships and will have to rely solely on financial aid and student loans. To clarify, I'm not trying to judge her or say that I'm better than her. Just that we have very different visions for our futures. \n\nHowever, the issue is that when I brought up the conversation of what colleges I wanted to apply to, my parents shut me down when I mentioned the ivy being my top school. \n\nThey told me that I need to limit myself and attend where my sister is going because that I need to help her out. I know they mean with tuition because they don't have anything saved for either of us and we have to pay for everything ourselves out of pocket. \n\nThey've told me for years that I need to help my sister and motivate her to do well.

I feel like I've already spent my whole life giving up things that will help me set up my future in order to not burden my parents. Especially after working so hard to get to this point, I feel like I'm just being told for the nth time that it's not enough.\n\nBoth my parents feel like I owe it to my mom to make sure my sister is stable because my mom sacrificed a lot raising us and just wants to make sure both of us are okay when she's not there.

Raising your sister isn\u2019t on you.", "NTA - You are not responsible for your sister or mother\u2019s future happiness. The fact that your parents are pushing this idea that you need to \u201ctake care of your sister at your own expense\u201d is not okay. It\u2019s unfortunately quite clear that your family is not going to be happy for you, but since you are funding college on your own they do not and should not get a vote. Best of luck!", "NTA\n\nOP please, please just apply where you actually want to go. Do you know how amazing it is that you actually have a self-motivation, goals and plan ? Not everyone your age does and it sucks, so don't throw it away for your sister, who might not even appreaciate your sacrifice if she does not see school as her priority.\n\nYou worked hard, your parents will not help with your school tuition so they have literally no say as you are an adult.  They should be proud of you as yourself, not their substitute parental influence on their other child.", "NTA taking care of your sister should have never been your responsibility.

You can use their address for the ivy league application.\n\nNTA but your parents are. Your sister is their responsibility, not yours. And she needs a chance to stand up on her own two feet. If you're constantly being made to sacrifice for her and take care of her, she'll never learn. So by going to different unis, you'll actually be doing her a favor.

If she can't get into a decent school and can't afford to pay for school...... She should either NOT go to college or figure something out. I know lots of people that joined the Air Force or Navy reserves or national guard (Air National Guard). A quick 4 years gets you 4 years of a college education for free.

She's an adult and while obviously you want to be there to support her, it's not your responsibility to be her crutch. They're also your parents' child too, not yours. They can help if need be.", ">I feels like it's not my responsibility anymore. \n\nI would tend to agree. You're both 18, out of high school, and planning for the future. Getting into an Ivy League school is a challenge so immensely difficult because only the most elite of students *around the whole freaking globe* even have a shot at that honor. And with that honor comes the opportunity and just about any job you could ever dream of. An Ivy League graduate is a creme de la creme candidate for an employer. Your folks are asking you to give up that honor, that potential for your future...to babysit your sister. I think the facts speak for themselves here.\n\nNTA.", "NTA both you and your sister would benefit from the opportunity to be your own people with you freed up from the responsibility of carrying your sister and your sister finally free to stand on her own two feet. She may blossom (hopefully), I\u2019m sure you will. \n\nYour parents are incredibly selfish and are wanting you to sacrifice your dreams so they can worry less. Their worry is their issue and they need to solve that themselves rather than make you responsible for it.", "NTA just realise you will likely get NO financial support so you better have great financial aid.", "NTA. Not even a little bit - your parents are massively out of line here. Firstly, being twins doesn\u2019t - and shouldn\u2019t - mean that you\u2019re joined at the hip for the rest of your lives. You can be close and loving while still making independent choices for your own futures.   \n\n\nSecond, your goals and dreams are worthy in their own right, and shouldn\u2019t be sacrificed to your sister\u2019s wants or needs. You\u2019re not asking for your parents to steal money from your twin\u2019s college fund to finance your dream - they\u2019re not financing it at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird, stop saying that your mom \u2018sacrificed\u2019 herself to raise you, and remember that your parents *chose* to have children. That\u2019s not always easy, but the hard stuff comes with the territory. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFourth, it doesn\u2019t sound like your parents have particularly considered your sister\u2019s wishes in any of this, either. Does she even want to go to college at this point in her life? She sounds like a fairly unenthusiastic student, which may mean that she wants/needs to pursue something else before (or instead of) college. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, if you allow your parents to manipulate or bully you into this, you\u2019re very likely to damage your relationship with your twin, possibly permanently. How will you feel if your chosen major isn\u2019t available at the schools your sister gets into? How will you feel if she drops out after a year, because with a little more experience and maturity under her belt she decides that what she actually wants to do with her life has nothing to do with college? How will you feel if you try to spend four years not just doing your own coursework but trying to keep your sister motivated to do hers? And how will your *sister* feel if she knows that you\u2019re growing to resent her because of the chances you missed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon\u2018t listen to your parents on this one, OP. Chase your own dreams, and encourage your sister to chase hers.", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"They told me that I need to limit myself and attend where my sister is going because that I need to help her out. \" .. don't. You are TWO adults, and each needs to fend for herself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApply to the uni to want to, but do it in secret. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd MAKE SURE you and your sister go to different unis.

It's not and should never have been your responsibility. You're doing great thinking ahead and working hard. Short of taking her exams for her (which is plagiarism and you obviously should not do), you can't change your sister's college and career trajectory. That is something which is in her and your parent's power. \n\nFair enough your parents may not have been able to afford everything which would put you in a more advantageous position. That doesn't mean that you should hold yourself back. If you have a shot, you should be going for it. It's incredibly selfish of them to expect you to limit yourself like that. In times of emergency, you pull down your own oxygen mask first. Your parents are asking you to do hers first and that's not right. \n\nWhilst I do generally think we should look out for others and support each other, it shouldn't be at the price of your future career. If you get a great career out of it as a result, you can always decide whether you're in a position to help her further down the line. You are her sibling and not her patron though. You're allowed to want good things for yourself, especially when you've worked so hard to get to this point.", "NTA", "NTA. Your career, and your dreams are in your own hand. I made a similar mistake by underperforming solely because I wanted to get into a uni with my friend, he performed well and we are in different unis now. I hate every moment of it. I bet you will regret following your parents' instructions.", "NTA. You deserve an opportunity to go to an Ivy League school if you can get in even without your twin. You are different people. I\u2019d say your struggles with being a twin and trying to separate yourself while being treated the same could be an outstanding topic for your application essay.", "NTA. You are not responsible for your sister\u2019s choices. \n\nTalk to your school\u2019s college counselor about how to apply to your chosen universities, including getting waivers for the application fees if necessary. Make sure your parents fill out the FAFSA paperwork as early as possible (before you get your acceptances) so you can get all the aid you need. Start researching scholarships now - small ones add up, and you will need the money for things like transportation. \n\nIf you are 18, or as soon as you turn 18, get your own bank account that they can\u2019t access, and get all your paperwork (birth certificate, social security card, passport if you have one) and keep those documents in a safe place. A safe deposit box at the bank costs about $40/year, and only you can open it. \n\nBe prepared for anger from your family, and preemptively talk to someone other than your parents about the situation so you have the tools necessary for dealing with them when the time comes. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. It won't help her anyway.  Whatever financial aid you get is intended for you.  It isn't a \"sharesies\" situation.  The institution giving aid doesn't want you to give it to someone else. You both are looking for the best school you can each afford and it sounds like she will need to take out loans. Maybe you won't.  If you do get aid, great, go there.", "I feel for you so much. I am about the same age as you and I got into a very prestigious school in my country this year, fearly similar to an Ivy League. I am lucky to live in a country where you don't have to pay a lot to go in, so my parents are able to pay my tuition without debt. I'm so deeply sorry. NTA, obviously. Maybe talk to your sister about this horrendous demand, she could maybe convince them to shut the fuck up. I really hope it's going to be fine. Be strong, we love and support you", "Why exactly does your sister need to study further? It doesnt look like she even wants to. Maybe a job or apprenticeship for her is a better way of helping her.", "NTA. Go follow your dream!  \nIt doesn't sound like your sister is really interested in academics so going to college may not be the best option for her and it may be better for her to either get an associates degree first or look into trade schools that may interest her.  She can still be successful even without a degree.", "Your Mom did not sacrifice raising you both, it was her job, which she has pushed off on you. Please consider how much you will have to borrow in picking your college. It\u2019s your parents and your sisters job to take care of her not yours. NTA", "Me too! I feel like giving in to her parents on this could actually cause lasting damage to OP\u2019s relationship with her twin, which would be awful when it\u2019s really neither girl\u2019s fault."]}
