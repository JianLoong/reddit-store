Getting into an Ivy League school is a challenge so immensely difficult because only the most elite of students *around the whole freaking globe* even have a shot at that honor. And with that honor comes the opportunity and just about any job you could ever dream of. An Ivy League graduate is a creme de la creme candidate for an employer. Your folks are asking you to give up that honor, that potential for your future...to babysit your sister. I think the facts speak for themselves here.\n\nNTA.", "NTA both you and your sister would benefit from the opportunity to be your own people with you freed up from the responsibility of carrying your sister and your sister finally free to stand on her own two feet. She may blossom (hopefully), I\u2019m sure you will. \n\nYour parents are incredibly selfish and are wanting you to sacrifice your dreams so they can worry less. Their worry is their issue and they need to solve that themselves rather than make you responsible for it.", "NTA just realise you will likely get NO financial support so you better have great financial aid.", "NTA. Not even a little bit - your parents are massively out of line here. Firstly, being twins doesn\u2019t - and shouldn\u2019t - mean that you\u2019re joined at the hip for the rest of your lives. You can be close and loving while still making independent choices for your own futures.   \n\n\nSecond, your goals and dreams are worthy in their own right, and shouldn\u2019t be sacrificed to your sister\u2019s wants or needs. You\u2019re not asking for your parents to steal money from your twin\u2019s college fund to finance your dream - they\u2019re not financing it at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird, stop saying that your mom \u2018sacrificed\u2019 herself to raise you, and remember that your parents *chose* to have children.

Does she even want to go to college at this point in her life? She sounds like a fairly unenthusiastic student, which may mean that she wants/needs to pursue something else before (or instead of) college. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, if you allow your parents to manipulate or bully you into this, you\u2019re very likely to damage your relationship with your twin, possibly permanently.

How will you feel if she drops out after a year, because with a little more experience and maturity under her belt she decides that what she actually wants to do with her life has nothing to do with college? How will you feel if you try to spend four years not just doing your own coursework but trying to keep your sister motivated to do hers? And how will your *sister* feel if she knows that you\u2019re growing to resent her because of the chances you missed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon\u2018t listen to your parents on this one, OP.

It's not and should never have been your responsibility. You're doing great thinking ahead and working hard. Short of taking her exams for her (which is plagiarism and you obviously should not do), you can't change your sister's college and career trajectory. That is something which is in her and your parent's power. \n\nFair enough your parents may not have been able to afford everything which would put you in a more advantageous position. That doesn't mean that you should hold yourself back. If you have a shot, you should be going for it. It's incredibly selfish of them to expect you to limit yourself like that. In times of emergency, you pull down your own oxygen mask first. Your parents are asking you to do hers first and that's not right. \n\nWhilst I do generally think we should look out for others and support each other, it shouldn't be at the price of your future career. If you get a great career out of it as a result, you can always decide whether you're in a position to help her further down the line. You are her sibling and not her patron though. You're allowed to want good things for yourself, especially when you've worked so hard to get to this point.", "NTA", "NTA. Your career, and your dreams are in your own hand. I made a similar mistake by underperforming solely because I wanted to get into a uni with my friend, he performed well and we are in different unis now. I hate every moment of it. I bet you will regret following your parents' instructions.", "NTA. You deserve an opportunity to go to an Ivy League school if you can get in even without your twin. You are different people. I\u2019d say your struggles with being a twin and trying to separate yourself while being treated the same could be an outstanding topic for your application essay.", "NTA. You are not responsible for your sister\u2019s choices. \n\nTalk to your school\u2019s college counselor about how to apply to your chosen universities, including getting waivers for the application fees if necessary. Make sure your parents fill out the FAFSA paperwork as early as possible (before you get your acceptances) so you can get all the aid you need. Start researching scholarships now - small ones add up, and you will need the money for things like transportation. \n\nIf you are 18, or as soon as you turn 18, get your own bank account that they can\u2019t access, and get all your paperwork (birth certificate, social security card, passport if you have one) and keep those documents in a safe place. A safe deposit box at the bank costs about $40/year, and only you can open it. \n\nBe prepared for anger from your family, and preemptively talk to someone other than your parents about the situation so you have the tools necessary for dealing with them when the time comes. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. It won't help her anyway.  Whatever financial aid you get is intended for you.  It isn't a \"sharesies\" situation.  The institution giving aid doesn't want you to give it to someone else. You both are looking for the best school you can each afford and it sounds like she will need to take out loans. Maybe you won't.  If you do get aid, great, go there.", "I feel for you so much. I am about the same age as you and I got into a very prestigious school in my country this year, fearly similar to an Ivy League. I am lucky to live in a country where you don't have to pay a lot to go in, so my parents are able to pay my tuition without debt. I'm so deeply sorry. NTA, obviously. Maybe talk to your sister about this horrendous demand, she could maybe convince them to shut the fuck up. I really hope it's going to be fine. Be strong, we love and support you", "Why exactly does your sister need to study further? It doesnt look like she even wants to. Maybe a job or apprenticeship for her is a better way of helping her.", "NTA. Go follow your dream!  \nIt doesn't sound like your sister is really interested in academics so going to college may not be the best option for her and it may be better for her to either get an associates degree first or look into trade schools that may interest her.  She can still be successful even without a degree.", "Your Mom did not sacrifice raising you both, it was her job, which she has pushed off on you. Please consider how much you will have to borrow in picking your college. It\u2019s your parents and your sisters job to take care of her not yours. NTA", "Me too! I feel like giving in to her parents on this could actually cause lasting damage to OP\u2019s relationship with her twin, which would be awful when it\u2019s really neither girl\u2019s fault.", "NTA - but there is a strange story that your parents appear to be telling, where your sister appears handicapped in some way.  You need to \"help her out\", your sister will \"struggle\", she is not reliably \"stable\", raising her required \"sacrifice\", your sister might not be OK without your mother.beside her.\n\nWhat *you* say about her is that she's not motivated but still passes classes without too much effort.  That's something very different from your parents' story.\n\nWhile I certainly don't think you should consider giving up your dreams for her, it would be interesting to know what your sister thinks.  Has she bought into your parents' rhetoric?  Does she want to go to university?  Is she simply going with a flow & not realising what is being asked of you?", "NTA. Until your sister works out what she wants to do, she will continue to be unmotivated and barely scrape passes. Do NOT hold yourself back for your sister. It will only lead to resentment and regret for you. What might really help your sister is to ask her if she has thought about what SHE wants to do with a complete disregard for what she thinks she should do. What is she good at? What does she enjoy? Check out resources that can help with deciding careers (your high school should be able to help with this). I had the same problem with my eldest. Until they found a goal for their future; they drifted along, barely passing or even failing. Now they are working towards a future they are interested in, their grades have drastically improved. Sometimes, it can be helpful to go straight into the workforce for a year and experience life a little. At that age, you often don't really know yourself yet and are highly influenced by what your parents want for you, even if you don't have any interest for it. There are so many interesting jobs out there I didn't even know existed at 18. It may be very helpful for her to have these conversations with OP. But ultimately, she needs to decide her own path and OP cannot take responsibility for that.\n\nOP should apply for scholarships and check out financial resources for the schools you want to attend. You have nothing to lose as your parents won't be financially supporting you anyway. This is one of those rare times where it is better to ask forgiveness than permission.", "NTA \n\n\nBut make sure you're actually doing your research for you. Apply for scholarships. Look into what schools might give you academic scholarships. Make sure your parents won't refuse to give you information in order for you to get financial aid if you don't go where they want. Make sure you are applying to \"safety schools\". With limited extra curricular activities, even with \"stellar grades,\" you aren't guaranteed a seat in an Ivy League school.", "NTA. I hate parents that do this to twins. You are an individual human being and it is NOT your responsibility to look after your sister. Don't even apply for the Unis she applies to. Apply for what you deserve - your sister doesn't even come into the equation. You've worked hard, you deserve this. Go get your dream, OP.", "NTA.\nplease, run! or else you'll always be the one who has to go after your sister.\nYou owe NOTHING to your mother, it's HER (their, counting your dad) decision to have children, so it's their responsibility to care and pay for you both.", "NTA. Your sister does not sound like she \u201cneeds\u201d you to be her second mommy which is what your mother wants\u2026probably envisions her two daughters living together across the street from her for the next 60 years. There is a life outside of academia and I hope your sister finds a way to escape your mother\u2019s control issues.", "NTA. You maybe twins but your parents need to start treating you both as the individuals you are. They're not doing your sister or you any favours by forcing you to support your sister or forcing your sister to be more like you. \n\nHow does your sister feel in all of this? If your in the US you could use this as your application essay, thats a thing right?\n\nIf you can apply for aid/scholarships/loans/housing and can help your sister sort the same then tell your parents you are helping by becoming financially independent meaning they don't need to split money between you 50/50 and can focus on helping your sister with whatever she decides she wants to do.", "NTA\n\nREPEAT AFTER ME: MY SISTER AND HER FUTURE ISNT MY RESPONSIBILITY!!!\n\nYou need to watch out for yourself and chase your dreams!

For some reason parents have a hard time treating twins as individual people.

It took my years to remove myself from the responsibility my parents tried to place on me. Well into adulthood my family thinks I need to help my twin. He has had every opportunity I had, I shouldn't have to make up for his mistakes and lack of ambition. Any of my achievements have been diminished by comments of \"don't share this news with the family it will make your brother feel bad.\" \"You need to help you brother, You need to tell your brother, your brother should have all that you have.\" I have a very ruff relationship with my Mother.

Your sister made her choices and will have a lovely life, with a different focus than yours. You have to be able to face the world as an individual now.

To clarify, I'm not trying to judge her or say that I'm better than her. Just that we have very different visions for our futures.*\n\nAs to selecting your colleges, please apply to your dream IVY league school and your other schools. Do not let yourself be hindered by your sisters situation. As I said before, you can't motivate her to do anything- she has to learn how to do these things. You won't be in her classes, you won't be taking her tests. She needs that inner motivation to be a good student. And maybe going to college now might not be the best thing for her. If she lacks motivation in the relatively structured environment of high school, she will be lost in the less strict environment of college.\n\nYou keep on reaching for your goals.

I feel so sad for so many people who are saddled with tens and hundreds of thousands of debt that will take decades to repay.

We CHOOSE to have them, so no payback is required. Just having them has been (mostly!) the purest love and joy that I could ever experience, and if anything, we \"owe\" them. Your parents want you to hold back and probably never acheive your full potential, just so your sister isn't left too far behind. They are her parents, not you, and setting her up for the best start to adult life is their (and her) responsibility,   not yours. \n\nGo to the Ivy League college, and grab your chances while you can.", "NTA. Get a PO Box and have your applications and acceptance letters sent there. Go where you want to and create your own path. Your sister will create hers. Good luck!", "NTA Why should the trend of sacrificing\u2019 people\u2019s future continue? Especially when your twin has shown zero motivation.  Why is it your responsibility to jeopardise the rest of your life for someone who doesn\u2019t care?", "It doesn't matter what your parents want if they're not paying. NTA. \n\n>Both my parents feel like I owe it to my mom to make sure my sister is stable because my mom sacrificed a lot raising us and just wants to make sure both of us are okay when she's not there.\n\nThat's not your job. Get in your ivy and your parents need to be actual parents to your sister. You can't do this anyway because eventually your sister will need to get her own job. You can't carry her everywhere.", "NTA.. live your own life!!!", "NTA \n\nAnd if it\u2019s on you to pay for college - for sure you should go where you\u2019re any to go - it\u2019s on your dime.", "NTA. You poor kid. Do not give into this emotional blackmail. Go to the school you want and go LC with your family.", "Heck, even with great extracurriculars, stellar grades, and excellent test scores one still might not get in, since so many people apply. \n\nDefinitely shoot your shot, but remember there are plenty of great schools that aren't Ivy so don't limit it to just Ivy or safety school.", "And hey, you've probably got some ammo in here for a killer admissions essay. Or not, I have no idea how admissions essays work. But make absolutely clear with wherever you apply that they are to only communicate with YOU. Don't give your parents any opportunity to fuck this up. Get any physical mail delivered to somewhere safe in case they try to intercept it and bin your acceptance letters. Protect yourself and your future.", "In general, I agree in the value of a college education. However, if they are unsure of what they want to do taking time off to be sure, or just get the core classes at a community college, should absolutely be an option. No one should be forced to take on the debt of a college degree.", "Hey! I just wanted to give you a little piece of mind about financial aid at ivy league colleges. \n\nGenerally speaking, if you get accepted to an ivy league college (and others in that tier not in the ivy league), they have pretty generous financial aid in lieu of merit scholarships. When I went to Brown, anyone who's parents made under $65000 a year didn't pay for anything. Tuition, room, board, and textbooks were all paid for.\n\nI'm not sure how much your parents make, but if they make anywhere near that number, odds are you will not have to pay for much if you get accepted to an ivy league school. This means any scholarships you get you can use for things like moving costs, school supplies, and other miscellaneous things you want or need. \n\nI hope you can realize your dream!", "My brother went to Harvard, but unfortunately my parents used up all their smart genes on their first kid. They said they rejected over half the kids with perfect SAT scores. \n\n\nI didn't mean apply to just Ivy and \"safety,\" but to a range. And definitely have schools that are safety schools....although they shouldn't be the same as her sister.", "Remember that you are your own separate person and have no obligation to create a life for her. It\u2019s never fair to treat multiples as if they are the same. You are allowed your own hobbies, friends, interests, life! Separate from someone who you happened to share a womb with. You can love and care for your twin and still be your own person! And you are NTA for that."]}
