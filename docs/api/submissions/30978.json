Without even saying Hi how are you or any of the basic greetings she immediately said with an attitude in her voice \u201cWhich one of you is this for\u201d I went to explain that it was for my family member and that he doesn\u2019t know English in which her response was exactly as followed \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know English but wants to drive\u201d in a very snarky way. I was taken a back by this but decided not to say anything as I thought maybe she had a bad day. Even her coworker that was next to her looked at her like why would you say that. I informed her that it was for a non driver ID. Next she told my family member to look at the screen below to sign the signature and I went to assist him as he doesn\u2019t know English and wanted to make sure he didn\u2019t press something like the donation thing that they have. She then yells at me saying that my family member has to sign in which I responded that I was only making sure he didn\u2019t press anything and to explain to him what he had to do because he doesn\u2019t know English not that I was signing anything for him. At this point I\u2019m a little irritated and asked for her name as I was going to give a complaint about what she said in which her response was \u201cGo ahead and make two\u201d pointing at me and my family member. I said I will and then she threatens me saying she doesn\u2019t have to help me if she doesn\u2019t want to in which I said okay but she did in fact help as I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s her job to do so and I wasn\u2019t being mean to her in anyway. \n\nNow that was the story but I got a little update on the situation. I talked to the supervisor and apparently the lady was going through a hard time as her son was killed. That event happened about two weeks ago and she has gotten 4 complaints since. The supervisor is trying to get her to go take some time off. Now I feel bad for writing the complaint and I am in the process of trying to get the complaint taken out because I know she\u2019s going through a hard time. While I don\u2019t believe that justifies her being rude to people and lashing out to someone who wasn\u2019t even rude to her, no one can really know what\u2019s it like to be in her shoes atm and I don\u2019t want to stress her out anymore with this complaint.

It's terrible that her son was killed, but if she's not in a mental state where she can serve customers, she shouldn't be serving customers.", "NTA\n\nYou could not have known, her behaviour *was* unacceptable, and your complaint *was* legitimate. \n\nIf there is any asshole here it is the DMV itself, because that poor woman should have been given weeks and weeks of compassionate leave", "NTA. Honestly, they should never have told you that and I find the story highly suspect. \n\nBut lets step back here cuz I have this argument all the time - Actions. Aren't. Emotions. \n\nShe's allowed to feel however she feels, but your right to have emotional reactions ends where someone else's right to not be abused begins. If you're angry or depressed or in crisis and you take that out on a bystander, you are the bad guy for doing that thing. \"I was feeling negative emotions\" is an excuse, not an apology. Its saying what you did is ok because your emotions and your weak self control is more important than other people's wellbeing. That's selfish.", "NTA. If she's going through a hard time, then she needs to take the time to heal. She can't continue making her trauma everyone else's problem. Going through difficult times doesn't license you to be an AH to the people around you, and if you work in a customer-facing position (like at a DMV), then you need to be able to be polite and civil while dealing with the general public.", "NTA\nI feel for her. But her situation is not an excuse to behave as she did.", "NTA - Her job is to serve the public and do to so professionally.  She is currently unable to do her job, and the DMV serves a critical role in many people's lives.  The complaints are justified.  Her situation is tragic, and she should take time off to help her process her grief.  Withdrawing your complaint seems like kind thing to do, but you shouldn't feel any responsibility to do so, and consider that you are enabling her cruelty towards others by withdrawing the complaint.", "NTA.\n\nIf she's having a hard time she shouldn't be at work. Respectfully, you have to leave whatever problems you have at the door and if you can't then you need to take leave.", "NTA.  Do not cancel the complaint.  That was unprofessional of the person you reported and the supervisor to tell you what happened to the son.   She clearly needs help and time off.  If she isn't going to recognize it then any bureaucratic process there is at the DMV for this situation needs to go through that process.  You and your family member did nothing wrong and didn't deserve to be treated that way,  It wasn't your fault that her son died.", "NTA how on earth were you to know that. The supervisor is sharing personal information to protect her colleague but that in turn is making the public feel badly. She needs to place this person on forced leave before she loses her job. Bereavement doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to belittle others.", "NTA, and her situation does not justify her rude behavior. If she needs to take time off, she needs to do that--and the supervisor needs to enforce it. Letting her be an AH to other people, who are also going through their own things, and have to be there because it's probably a required service, is not any better.\n\nDo not retract the complaint. It is honest, justified, and may in the end help others.", "NTA. Not American, but I have worked in a front-facing role for the public sector. We all have off-days, but that\u2019s never an excuse to make snarky comments to, or about, someone because they aren\u2019t fluent in English.\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the rules are at the DMV, but I will say we had to be really stringent with security when a third party was translating. Lots of times, the interpreter would answer security questions on behalf of a customer, rather than relaying the question then translating an answer - which would void our security process and send them back to the end of the queue. However, we would try our best to work around this by explaining the rules to the translator and client at the start of our interaction. I imagine the reaction to you potentially signing may be a short-tempered reaction to a similar security procedure. However, this does not explain her earlier comments.\n\n\nPlease do not feel bad for complaining. Front-facing public sector staff often deal with a lot of highly vulnerable members of the public. If she was this shitty to your family member, who had support with them, it\u2019s scary to think what she could be doing to those without support.", "NTA. She's a public servant and she was extremely rude and unprofessional toward you. It's terrible about her son, but if she is unable to perform her job while she grapples with her grief, she should take some time off. You are being very kind by trying to rescind your complaint, but honestly, that supervisor should not have even told you about her son, nor should he have shared with you that other complaints have been made.", "NTA. Working with the public is difficult enough, however, even though she is going through a difficult time it does not give her the right to be rude to you or anyone else, especially at her job. It's her job to be professional.", "NTA - It's understandable that you were frustrated with the DMV worker's attitude, but learning about her personal tragedy provides some context. While it doesn't excuse her behavior, it does shed light on why she may have been acting out. It's commendable that you're considering retracting your complaint as you don't want to add any additional stress to her already difficult situation. You were just looking out for your family member and wanting to ensure their needs were met. It's important to show empathy and understanding, even in frustrating situations. You're definitely not the asshole here.", "NTA.  Regardless of her personal circumstances she is in a front line professional position and should behave appropriately.  The issue is with her management for not removing her temporarily from that position when her behaviour started creating complaints.", "NTA. You didn't know and you're now trying to help her by having your complaint withdrawn.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
