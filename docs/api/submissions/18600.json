Your father's intentions are reflected concretely there and any claim that he promised her something else are suspicious.  He may have never said it or he may have changed his mind.  Borderline YTA for thinking any of the personal animosity between your and your aunt has anything to do with it, though.", "NTA there is a will. She got what he wants her to have.", "A will is a will and assets are divided per that document. She can want all she wants but your dad never made any changes from what he left her and what he told her he would leave her, or maybe he did in your favor after you reconciled. Either way she is only entitled to what is documented and you don\u2019t owe her anything. End of life arguments over money and such are so disturbing to me. Just finishing up my moms trust and will and it\u2019s been exhausting her trying to figure out how to make everyone happy when she\u2019s gone. She\u2019s worried about how much money might be left. I told her they could maybe buy a new car, go on a nice vacation or have a nice dinner depending on what\u2019s left but that she should spend her money as needed/wanted in the meantime.

We take PRIDE very seriously and you're welcome to march in parades !\n\nIf your father wanted her to have more than he had listed in the Will, he would have altered the Will or made her a gift.  He didn't.  A Million is lots of money from a sibling.  Most people leave all their wealth to their children or charities and don't consider siblings.

A million would solve every single one of my financial troubles rn, so she's just being entitled.\n\nNTA, OP, don't share your money with her, she got plenty. And I'm sorry for your loss!", "Why should OP pay for a lawyer when the Aunt appears to have no evidence of the promise beyond 3 people\u2019s verbal testimony? I can promise to jump over the moon but it doesn\u2019t mean it will actually happen.", "Lol what? Did you read the post it clear states the dollar amounts", "OP should consider going to a lawyer because estate division with family members like this is bitter and draining.
