They did HORRIBLE things under the influence and before they were medically treated for a mental disorder, yet don\u2019t remember (or acknowledge) their poor behavior - they only focus our reactions. So of course we are the bad guys. I have a hard time seeing you as a victim here.", "NTA he left her what was intended for her. You don't owe her anything.", "NTA. Your father left her a million dollars in his will, so that is precisely what he wanted her to have. Most people would think that a million dollars is  \"a big amount of money\".  That should certainly solve her financial problems. \n\nWhy would anyone be mean to someone, then expect them to hand over millions? \n\nYOUR FATHER LEFT YOU HIS MONEY BECAUSE HE WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT. \n\nWhere there is money, there will always be greedy people who think they should have a claim on it. They do not. Stand firm.", "NTA - she is only entitled to what is in the will.  Nothing more.", "NTA. She just got a million dollars, she's not struggling financially, she's greedy. Don't give her one cent! If he wanted her to have more, he would have amended the will to indicate that.", "Right?? I did the math once (a couple years ago so rampant inflation may have fucked this plan) but if I randomly got 1mil, I could live comfortably without having to work for 30 years.

She probably poured poison into his ear about you for your entire life just to get a nice payday.", "But Dad decided on the final amount."]}
