But really there is no reason to be offended.  She is just being who she is, which is entitled and a mooch.  Just decline to pay.  Don't fall for a guilt trip, which will be her next move.

You need to reevaluate your friendship with her. This is not how a true friend acts. She is taking advantage of you.", "NTA. Friend is taking advantage of you so everyone else won't have to pay as much money for the weekend. If it was me, I'd also tell her i can't be her MOH. Then again, I'm petty.", "NTA.
