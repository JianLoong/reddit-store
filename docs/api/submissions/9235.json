(I wasn\u2019t the one who called the police. I tried to be civil with her and she accused me of things and tried to get Elaine to hate me.) (Elaine LOVES me) Savanna has even refused to meet me since the day I started dating this man.\n\nIsaac and Savanna had a thing that savanna wanted that no one could touch Elaine\u2019s hair because Isaac isn\u2019t black. He had also not been informed she was going to mediation so everything she said went. Elaine has very curly hair like me. Savanna doesn\u2019t actually know how to do hair as she doesn\u2019t have any due to the same things she\u2019s done to Elaine\u2019s hair. They went to mediation again and the judge told her off and said we are allowed to do and wash her hair because I am black and white just like Elaine and it\u2019s racist of her to not allow us to even wash her hair bc we \u201caren\u2019t black\u201d (judges words not mine bc savanna kept fighting saying we weren\u2019t black)savanna always had her \u201csister\u201d do Elaine\u2019s hair in \u201cprotective\u201d styles including extensions on a 3 yr. Old. CONSTANTLY to where Elaine is losing her hair. \n\nThe mediation ALSO said we would no longer pay her child support since savanna owed Isaac a lot of money. So till that was paid off we didn\u2019t owe her a dime. \n\nIn that time, she couldn\u2019t afford to get Elaine\u2019s hair done anymore. Well, I started doing her hair because savanna wouldn\u2019t even untangle her hair (Elaine hates it being done so bad. She said her moms hurts her with it then gets mad.) and Elaine has loved it! I use products for her hair specifically and her hair has grown back amazingly!  Her mom would send her back to us in the same style I had done it in the week or 2 before. Didn\u2019t wash her hair or take it out once so I redid it one last time. \n\n\nHere\u2019s the issue, savanna messaged for a week and a half straight about Elaine\u2019s hair being done this time. Saying I don\u2019t know anything about black people hair and calling me racist names. Threatening me and so much more. Claiming the stuff she \u201cuses\u201d on Elaine\u2019s hair is better and it isn\u2019t. She broke communication clauses. So she finally got child support again and immediately went and got her hair done by her sister in very tight braids with extensions. While continuing to harass me for doing Elaine\u2019s hair even though I have been for months. This time, her hair was in a nice design and beautifully curly. AITA for this? And should I just back off? She\u2019s flipping out even when I haven\u2019t touched the hair.

However, as a judge has ruled in your favor on this AND you seem to have done at least some basic reading/researching on how to take care of black hair, I don't see how you're harming the child or her hair in any way.\n\nIt sounds like she has deeper issues regarding you and this isn't really about the hair.", "I don\u2019t know if we have enough info, but if the court said you can do her hair, I don\u2019t see why not.", "INFO: why hasn\u2019t your husband learned how to properly care for his own child\u2019s hair?", "NTA.  If you\u2019ve been responding and trying to reason with her, you should give up. She is coming from a very emotional place, and she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with you\u2014she just wants a way to bash you when she\u2019s frustrated with her own life. \n\nIn fact, can you just block her and have all communication go through Isaac?", "It sounds like Savannah is abusing Elaine. And if she's breaking communication rules you need to document that and give that info to the judge. I would be worried she's hurting Elaine in retaliation to Elaine *not* hating you. The alienation isn't working because Savannah herself is cruel to Elaine. \n\nDocument the shit out of her coming back with mats, dirty hair etc and I hope Isaac is working toward full custody of his ex is treating Elaine that way when she can't spend the child support on hair extensions on a baby.\n\nNTA but there's so much going on here that makes me worried for Elaine's safety :(", "NTA. Legally you can, because the judge says so. Anything else would be stupid, even if both of you were white, you should only be denied if you were hurting her. Which her mother is!\n\nThe question is; is it worth it. To me it sounds as if the mother will hate you anyways. Whatever you do, she'll hate you. She just hates you even more for the things her daughter likes about you. She also seems to use race against you, which is extra weird when you're mixed. So clearly she isn't going to be reasonable about it and being nice or avoiding the things she doesn't like clearly isn't going to solve anything. \n\nSo, if you avoid touching her hair but find other ways to bond with the daughter she'll hate you for that too.\n\nSo, I say ignore her. Don't antagonise or engage in arguments but also don't yield. Document her messages and words. She WILL try to get you two and especially you on whatever she can, so just document everything she's done and said to you. Then document why that was unjustified (which product you used, the styles you did on her daughter, and how she didn't wash her daughters hair, and how tight the braids are when her sister does it). Note down all dates etc in a document and save the pictures in a folder with that document. Get witness statements when that's relevant. If she breaks any official rules or agreements, send it in to whatever office you use to regulate the rules if that's possible. Do this regularly as it's harder to remember everything when it's been a year or more. Don't use it, just keep it (if you have to mediate again I'm not sure if it's best to bring it or not if it's not needed, asking a professional might be a good idea). If you stay with him you'll need it sooner or later.", "Bit of a stretch here. I'm not saying a judge would not order the end of cs for a minor. I take that back rereading, you said a mediator. Chile no judge in his/her right mind would ever end a support order for a minor over money owed. That's a civil matter, not family court. The mediator CAN'T make that judgment, only a judge can and since (if we are talking about the US), in just about every state they LEGALLY cannot unless both parties agreed to it as that's literally the law as written. I'm just not buying this one bit. In mediation the final signoff is always done by a judge as they are the only ones who legally can.", "WTF, extensions on a three year old?!

We needed up with more time with Elaine as well.

I\u2019m confused myself on this that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t go into more detail. Had something to do with back insurance she wasn\u2019t paying and had already been ordered to pay. And if she hadn\u2019t, she faced jail time since she was aware. She agreed to stop child support until it was paid back. So yes it of course was signed by a judge for the order to be put in place and the money was to do with Elaine not just she owed him random money", "She actually has 4b 4c hair but it is extremely thin compared to her baby pictures. She even begged and cried for me to take out the extensions. They aren\u2019t even her color either they\u2019re blond or orange. And I know plenty white or other race stylist that are educated on black hair and I feel the same.

There are black Americans who are extreme in their views when it comes to race, but my experience is has been more prevalent with Caribbeans and Africans. Most are pretty cool, but there\u2019s always a few bad eggs. Considering there\u2019s a combined history and renewed interest in that history it sucks she\u2019s not more open minded. I\u2019m also concerned what her daughter is picking up on. \n\nHave you shared your experiences growing up biracial with your fianc\u00e9?

I already said any of that was for context only.", "It would be different if the child had an issue with her hair being done with you. You state that she loves it when you do her hair. Although the people who seem to think consent before changing a baby's diaper seem a bit off to me, I do think that giving even young children some bodily autonomy is important. It's Elaine's hair and she is old enough to know what she's comfortable with.", "I don't know if it's possible to document that the hair is being done improperly and doing damage enough for it to matter in court.\n\nHair falling out is often a sign of mistreatment. If your partner can afford to talk to a lawyer about this I think it's worth it.\n\nThis sounds like a form of physical abuse I just don't know if it can be proven.", "First, NTA. You take care of that little girl and keep showing her that there's someone in her corner.\n\nSecond, have you been documenting the fact that Elaine's hair is coming back dirty/extensions are damaging her hair/the communication violations? \n\nI'd be stockpiling these receipts and going back to the judge. It sounds like Savanah is using Elaine as a power chip, and she's neglecting her when that emotional usefulness is up. Record the next conversation with Elaine where she talks about it hurting and her Mom getting angry & leaving her with tangled/dirty hair.", "Also! Dad should learn some hairstyles IMO. You won\u2019t be guaranteed to be around every single weekend, so maybe teach him some simple ones to start with?", "What do you think will happen if you continue doing her hair? Will her mom be angry? Will there be retaliation? Do you think your SD is being abused? Is this more of a rant or do you think there is an actual basis for you to be TA?", "That\u2019s good then. Since it sounds like you know how to properly care for her hair, NTA. Her mother should not expect proper hygiene & grooming not to happen when she is with her other parent.", "Yes she is. She is only to contact for emergencies and updates because she has something to be angry about anytime she\u2019s over here and mediation had acknowledged this. That\u2019s why the communication has been put in place that she broke multiple times", "You are overstepping her boundaries. But those boundaries aren't there for her daughters sake. None of what she does is for the best of her daughter.\n\nUnreasonable people do unreasonable shit. There are plenty of black people who hate white people, act like shit and talk shut about white people, while expecting white people to treat them like royals. All while complaining about racism, while being racists. It's the same phenomenon where women call themselves \"feminists\" but really just want to crave special treatment while treating all others like shit. Ruining and undermining feminism/BLM as they go. Stupid people are going to do stupid shit and expecting logic is only going to disappoint you. The problem is when you have to deal with them on a regular basis. All you can do is be good to the daughter, not engage more than necessary, and document what you do and don't do so she can't get you.\n\nI feel for you though.

Bad situation all around.", "The question makes no sense without the context.\n\nWhat does your husband think you should do?", "Exactly. I never do it if she does not want it done that day but she still gets it washed during bath time. Her mom forced her every month to have it braided or corn rolled and she hates having it done every time. (Of course I don\u2019t know what Elaine is saying while she\u2019s with them just what Elaine has told me)", "We have been taking photos and noting the dates. She has it done so often that it can be hard to document the hair loss as she uses extensions that aren\u2019t her real hair. We have a lawyer and he\u2019s getting ready to set up a court date. They had to wait 3 months after mediation", "We have been piling things on. I tried to keep the court part very limited as it wasn\u2019t part of my question but used only for context. Thank you!", "He has definitely been learning and watching me and will apply products to her hair that I had him buy specifically for her", "I personally think her mom will be more angry. She already has expressed her anger not towards her hair being done but the fact that I did her hair. She\u2019s also not allowed anywhere near me so I don\u2019t think she would retaliate. Definitely not a rant I\u2019m not angry. More if she thinks I\u2019m TA so I wanted to know if I am or overstepping boundaries", "Yeah she tried to make it that way with the courts as well. Apparently \u201cshe\u2019s the only parent and we\u2019re just babysitters\u201d", "I know it's separate from your question but make sure to screenshot and keep those messages. Isaac needs to use them in court. It's good he's following his mediation guidelines but y'all need to protect yourselves and make sure to keep Savannah in check through the legal system. Good job focusing on making sure Elaine's cared for and her scalp isn't hurting.", "I understand that. I just wish in her reasoning it was for her boundaries. Not because of race or anything else. It was just because her hair looked nice which she already stated\u2026. I totally agree with the black and white people racism that you said. Everyone is racists but wants to be treated like a god. Like no. But thank you! I\u2019m sorry for what you went through", "I\u2019m open to all questions. Husband is going to things with the courts regarding other things. The only thing I can do is take it. Cops and cps have done nothing. But like i said, this post is strictly about her hair.", "This is pure, wild speculation here on my part but it might be possible that the mother is sensitive about her daughter being mixed race and wants her to present as black as possible. She may have also gone through getting those painful hair treatments done as early as Elaine and believes that it's a part of being black to go through that as well. The cultural validity of that is debatable (I can see both sides of it) but how Elaine wears her hair doesn't change her identity. She may really hate that her daughter spends time in a household with people who aren't as into black culture as she is and worries it will impact her views on the culture or something. For some people, it's a thing.", "Yay!! Good to hear!", "Ok that\u2019s good to know. Is there a reason against your not doing her hair other than you not being \u201cblack enough\u201d? Do you think it would be ok to lie in this situation and say you get it done professionally, or actually get it done professionally?", "I think the worry is thay they'll retaliate against Elaine.", "Well clearly this woman is delusional unless we are missing some major info on your husband.", "We have tons of evidence just waiting on our court date now!", "I understand. You want to get along and not harm her or her daughter. And I'd agree to avoid doing her hair if that would solve anything. However I suspect it wouldn't. I suspect the only solution she really wants is for you to move out and leave for good. I mean she even talks down on her own daughter, this woman isn't going to bring any good to anyone's lives. I hope she calms down and gets over it with time, and treats her daughter well. That is the most important thing here, it's sad that a mother puts her 3 yo through unnecessary hardships. \nThank you. Best of luck!", "What does your husband think you should do?", "She is worried. But she didn\u2019t get her hair done as a kid either according to her. But she swears she can do hair when it\u2019s her sister her does Elaine\u2019s hair. We also never deter Elaine from either sides of her culture but savanna has been telling her she\u2019s only African and not white either\u2026 when she\u2019s American just black. Ofc we teach her about African since her mother is from there but we try to make sure she knows she\u2019s both\u2026 even if her mom had that treatment it\u2019s still wrong. My family is part from Africa too and they still know when enough is enough", "He enjoys doing it actually! Just when he\u2019s home and not working", "I have thought about getting it done professionally but her mother takes her hair out when I get it done like that. She hasn\u2019t stated any other reason that I\u2019m aware of though. She claimed I use cheap products but doesn\u2019t actually know what I use which is good for hair based on research and other things. But other than that she has nothing.

He knows how I feel and vise versa", "I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re going with this. I\u2019ve spoken with him. We\u2019ve spoken with higher people such as cops and other things. I\u2019m basically asking should I step off of doing her kids hair. I\u2019m already ignoring her she can\u2019t physically message me. But some are saying I\u2019m over stepping HER boundaries and that\u2019s what im asking. But im also getting told to keep going or take her to court among other things.", "Your Fianc\u00e9 needs to contact his attorney asap about getting full custody. This is child abuse!! She\u2019s not properly caring for her and putting this tight protective styles in her hair is damaging it. Save every text message and document everything.", ">no one could touch Elaine's hair because Isaac isn't black\n\nI'm genuinely really confused by what this means. Is it some sort of cultural thing? I've never heard of this before.", "Definitely NtA. Mom\u2019s issues clearly are not about her child\u2019s hair but with you directly. She\u2019s grasping at straws because you daughter loves you and she can\u2019t stand it. She can\u2019t take not being the most important woman in her child\u2019s life. It\u2019s all about control and a power play. If Elaine is happy with doing her hair and asks, then do it if you\u2019re not breaking any custody rules. I would also report the mom for breaking the no contact rule and for the facts name calling. She\u2019s putting her own daughter int the middle of her childish bullshit!", "We are working towards it luckily!", "Yes. Savanna is Haitian and claims \u201canyone who isn\u2019t African can\u2019t do black people hair\u201d she just assumed bc he\u2019s white and I\u2019m half white that we don\u2019t know anything about curly black hair. I have curly hair lol", "It sounds like she's lucky to have you :)"]}
