My husband's family joined us for thanksgiving . Mom 56ish, middle brother A with 2 kids( 2 and 3 yo )and youngest brother B. It was amazing we had a good deal of fun. They came from another state which I appreciate. Some of our friends here joined us as well and it was a good time all around. \n\nUnfortunately the entire time A kept saying he will move closer to us and we can help him take care of the kids. He is recently divorced and mom has been helping him watch the kids (long story on the divorce) . Me and my husband both work and dont have the time for this. Also we are having fertility issues so I am not particularly interested in watching his kids. He is also super negligent of the kids which makes me angry because everyone pretends its not happening things like changing the daiper barely twice a day, going out to smoke leaving them alone, i found the kids almost falling down the stairs at 6 am because he wouldn't wake up to watch them. We have helped him in the past financially but he has never returned any of the help we give yet he buys expensive things for himself (although he tells us constantly that he understands its a loan) .\n\nWe told him he wouldn't be able to afford our state on his salary since he makes 17 an hr and it will be very difficult to cover expenses on it and he will not be able to get, the kind of help mom is giving, from us. She watches them almost every weekend. He says he has a girl here who he \"might\"  be dating and she will help him.He insists he can no longer live in his current state because of all the bad memories. We will only be needed for emergencies like if his son broke an arm. I flatly said we might still not be available and he looked very offended.\n\nPart of me felt like it needed to be said but  my husband thinks I crossed a line so here I am torn before I apologize.", "created_utc": 1669683575, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7enta/aita_for_telling_by_bil_i_wouldnt_watch_his_kids/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see this being a very bad thing for your marriage.", "NTA.  You didn't have any fun in making those kids, so you shouldn't have to pay for their care.  Good for you for knocking him off his petal stool and letting him know you are not free daycare.", "Nta\n\n\nYou need to discuss this with your husband.  And get on the same page with money and time commitment. \n\n\nIf your husband is insisting on giving help. Separate your finances and leave when he takes the kids.\n\n\nThis is a disaster waiting to happen.", "NTA.\n\nBIL has a sense of entitlement thinking he can hand his kids off to whoever he wants and no one has any say.\n\nYour husband says you crossed a line?? Is he willing to drop everything at any time of day to constantly pick up his brothers slack as a parent? Family is there to help, sure, but BIL definitely seems the type to take advantage.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder he is recently divorced. He sounds immature and just plain annoying. In any case, you\u2019re entitled to your own boundaries and it doesn\u2019t matter if he is family; he can respect them or stay away.", "NTA. Boundaries are important. You\u2019ve made yours clear.", "NTA-You need to set those boundaries in stone or you may well be getting a lot of \u201cemergencies\u201d.", "DO NOT APOLOGIZE for telling him the truth! If you do, he WILL interpret it that you changed your mind and will take the kids every time he feels like acting like a teenager instead of a father. The ex-wife must be a real nut job for this flake to have primary custody.\n\nAbsolutely NTA. You could tell him you'll \"think about\" babysitting his kids in an emergency AFTER he pays your loan back! That might shut him up for awhile. Seriously, if you give in one time, you'll be raising his kids forever, so I really recommend you never agree to it even once.", "NTA it\u2019s good that you are setting up boundaries. He might try to trample your boundaries so make sure you and your husband are a united front. I do hate that the children have to deal with him.\n\nEdited for typo.", "NTA. One should never just assume another person is okay with helping rear their children, no matter what the relationship is. You can't just hand off your responsibilities to someone else. He didn't even ask, just told you that he would be moving and you are to help take care of his kids.", "NTA - But you obviously have a husband issue here if he thinks you were out of line to set things clear like this.  BIL has already proved himself a moocher and frat boy behavior seems to be his forte, so I can just imagine there will be an \"emergency\" every few days.  If you let him in the door even once, he'll be hanging on you forever.  Sorry for the kids, but maybe he should try growing up and being a father.", "NTA sit boundaries quickly or you will always have the kids. And do not apologize if you do he will take it as it\u2019s ok to use you.", "NTA\n\nThey're not your kids and it seems you never made any promises to him personally about taking care of them. Honestly, I personally would have brushed off the topic without giving a definite answer before discussing it with my husband in private where I'd make my stance and reasoning clear. As a married couple, that is a topic to discuss between just you two alone because it deals with both of you even if only one of you agrees to actively watch the kids.", "NTA.  He sounds like the kind of guy who will take a mile if you give an inch.  So don't give the inch.", "Nope, not your problem. NTA", "Hard to say honestly. I totally understand what you're saying and hear the struggles about fertility issues and the financial and time burden the kids and he would have on you guys. My first concern is the kids though because ultimately they are the real victims here. they need someone who won't neglect them and will love them. They can't control anything about their situation and ultimately will suffer the most.", "NTA. Always draw a hard line with people who offer up your services for free.", "You\u2019ll need hard boundaries with him from the beginning - \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence. He sounds like the type to consistently test boundaries until he wears you down. My ex was like this, but I never budged on anything, because I knew he would take any compromise on my end to mean that I really do want him in my life. Life is too damn short to be carrying other people\u2019s burdens.", "Info: is he actually neglecting his kids? If so, ywbta not to report it. Otherwise n.t.a.", "NTA and you need to put your foot down now with your husband. You\u2019re right BIL can\u2019t afford your state, he\u2019s going to ask to move in temporarily and you\u2019re husband will push until you give in. It\u2019ll be just for a few weeks but a few weeks will turn to months and then years and they\u2019ll expect you the woman to watch the kids. Just no to all of it.

If the kids aren\u2019t yours, you\u2019re not obligated to care for them.

His kids are HIS problem, not yours.", "NTA. NO ONE is required to help you with YOUR children. Period, end of story. If he plans on moving closer just for the free help he's gonna end up with a big surprise", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019d take any \u2018emergencies only\u2019 concession and tear it wide open.

Tell him if the kid breaks an arm or leg you may possibly consider it.", "NTA  Going through fertility is emotionally, mentally, (can be) financially draining and time consuming dealing with specialists/treatments. You and husband need to get on the same page of what your priorities are right now. Supporting BIL and kiddos or starting your own family. Adding unnecessary stress to an already stressful situation will take it's toll on you and husband individually, your relationship as a whole and trying to start a family in that environment will lead to more issues trying to get pregnant. Stress does not create a happy  baby bubble.\n\nDon't apologize, you have nothing to apologize for imo. Never apologize for being honest.", "Nope, definitely NTA. You already know in your gut that he will never repay that money and that he will use you and your husband for free childcare. You needed to draw a hard boundary and enforce it with him.", "NTA for not watching the kids, but you don't get to decide what state he lives in.  He can move next door to you if he wants, just don't watch his kids.", "NTA- He wasn't asking if you guys were able to help him out with childcare, he was making statements like it was a done deal. Even after telling him that he offered your help for emergencies without asking if that was ok. I think you did the smart thing by not leaving it unsaid, because he sounds like he would try to make anything an emergency to leave the kids with you. If anyone crossed a line it was him by thinking you guys would be ok with being second parents to his kids because he's a crap dad.", "YTA. You are sort of being a bit judgmental. He\u2019s a single parent trying to move closer to family. You have infertility issues, so you\u2019re also resentful. Should he make better life decisions? Probably. These are your nieces/nephews, and you\u2019re acting like a butthole. I love my aunts and uncles because they were there for me. You seem horrible.", "I think I got caught up in the moment and I wanted him to understand we cannot be available anytime and he has no money to hire a babysitter. I do feel I could have worded it better. Although back tracking feels like a mistake too.", "This. NTA op", "I do think that he will consider this an agreement to watch his kids .", "The emergency happen quite frequently.  The kids have had several scares with covid in the past month. The mom had to take time off because A couldn't get off work. This is part of the reason I didn't want to sign up for it.", "I agree about the kids but OP shouldn\u2019t have to set herself on fire to keep others warm.", "Thanks", "I feel like he does based on how much I had to watch them in the  6 days they were here. But it could be he was taking it easy because other people were around. My MIL assures me at every turn that he is a great father since I am not there all the time I don't have the full picture.", "Agreed. We just told him it's not a good idea but he thinks he can so I guess he will.", "I would dial this back to ESH, the BIL also needs to accept that not everyone is willing to step up for various reasons. He asked the question and didn't like the answer.", "Yeah, if it were me, I'd just leave it.  Maybe that last bit was the teeniest bit AH, but it is in self defense so....  \n\n\nWe all make mistakes, but based on how he's been acting so far, it seems that putting the fear of God into him, financially speaking, isn't the worst idea.", "You did exactly what was needed because the kind of people who pull this  (hey I'm going to move next to you and expect you to bend to MY whims) almost always have a bizarre definition of emergency the instant they know that word gets them what they want.", "Is this a strong enough case to report to CPS? With such a deadbeat father, the kids may actually be better off with a foster family", "I can understand why you don't want any part of that circus.  Good luck to you!", "Exactly it\u2019s not op\u2019s responsibility to pick up the slack. Bil isn\u2019t entitled to free babysitting", "True, that's why it's hard for me to say either way. Maybe if the neglect is so bad perhaps child services should investigate, but then again that might make things worse idk. I have little hope he'd suddenly start getting his shit together as far as the children, that being said who should be set on fire? Adults or the kids? Obviously I don't know the intricacies of it all but it's not likely the kids will do well if left alone.", "I\u2019ll be flat out honest and say I definitely take it easy when I know my family is helping out (but we do have that relationship established). Parenting is hard and I\u2019m not even doing it solo. Most of your examples could really go both ways (like did he step out for a 3 min smoke while they were inside napping and other adults were nearby? If so, nbd). But if you keep an eye on it and it becomes truly concerning, say something to someone.", "My MIL assures me he is taking it easy because we are around", "Maybe they should discuss grandma taking them in and having regular visits with dad if it's bad enough for him to stomp on boundaries like that.", "I have ring so I was able to look at his breaks. Usually 20 mins every couple of hrs he was also texting someone. He just disappeared without telling anyone. No one was awake is the morning and the kids usually wake us early. I woke up to the noise the kids made once and the other time I woke up to his alarm and he didn't. I woke him up telling him the kids are up and went back to sleep.", "Grandma has already said she wants to be a grand parent and not a parent. He lived with her for months and didn't take care of the kids or the house much. So I understand her frustration.", "Hmm iffy. This *does* sound like he\u2019s probably behaving different knowing someone will pick up the slack. I say NTA since he clearly tests boundaries.", "That's fair, where is mom in all of this?", "The mom is a long story. She was 18 when she got pregnant with the first kid . The BIL paints her as a horrible manipulative person who didn't get along with MIL. MIL is also in complete agreement that the mom was horrible. The BIL and wife excluded MIL from everything related to kids while they were married. Then supposedly she chaeted on him and didn't show up for custody hearing or divorce . A lot of this is hearsay but safe to say she is not in the picture. I personally think she was too young and being used by him but I have been told quite sternly by MIL I am wrong so tend not to broach the subject anymore.", "Dang a messed up situation for everyone it seems. I really agree that you guys shouldn't have to suffer the loss of boundaries for what sounds like a deadbeat. Those poor kids. I hope they end up with a better life however this plays out. And ftr yeah 18 is too young even for the more responsible and nurturing person. There's so much life to be lived and things to learn. 18 in a lot of ways is still a kid.", "NTA. \n\nEven if you said yes to emergency situations only, suddenly there would be a lot of emergencies", "NTA his kids are not your responsabilities and set a hard line with him to might not be to NO.", "NTA Boundary set.", "NTA. Some people can't accept a tactful no, so unfortunately you have to get very firm and blunt so there are zero misunderstandings.", "NTA.", "INFO Where is his ex wife? Because it sounds like he thinks that he can give away his kids to you since you and your husband are having fertility issues. Like BOOM! Problem solved!!", "NTA but talk to your husband about how much he thinks you guys should help.\nIf he can\u2019t afford to live in your area he might show up on your doorstep looking for a place to stay.\nYou guys need to be on the same page before that happens", "Not sure how to judge here bc you're kinda both the ah and nta at the same time. You shouldn't have made a statement without talking to your husband and making sure you both were on the same page. Should have said something like \"this is a private conversation that needs to happen at a more appropriate time.\" However, we can \"should have\" all day long it doesn't matter bc what's done is done. \n\nHave a talk with hubby and maybe apologize for speaking for both of you before having a conversation with him. Then talk about what you would be able and willing to do if/when A moves closer. Make sure you are on the same page and go from there", "NTA. You were speaking for yourself (looking at your title).  I imagine that your husband could watch them on his own if he were so inclined.", "ESH. Your brother for obvious reasons. But it sounds like, regarding the kids specifically, your brother only suggested that he'd like to be near family in case of emergency. To which you told him no. The example you give is your nephew breaking his arm, and you're saying even that is not enough to make you want to step in to help? \n\nThe only ones who sound like they're not a-holes in this situation are your mom and the kids.", "Could he legally move to your state with his kids? What about his ex/the mother and her custody?", "I don't think you did a single thing wrong, OP, not with the wording or delivery. Some people *require* an extra dose of firmness and based on everything you wrote about him and his behavior, he needs several extra helpings or he'll get confused about this just like he does the loans.   \nIt's honestly more compassionate for you to be firm and truthful up front, so yeah he's offended now but at least he is closer to maybe understanding that moving doesn't guarantee him free childcare, no matter how bad he needs it. And maybe he should deeply consider uprooting his current living situation (better cost of living) on the false expectation that he's got free childcare whenever he needs it. NTA", "While it\u2019s true that you could\u2019ve worded your response to him better, i think it\u2019s worth noting that HE could have worded his \u201crequest\u201d ALOT better. It sounds like he just sprang this on y\u2019all, on a family holiday, and expected it to go over well? considering the context of how he\u2019s been parenting them, i think you set a necessary boundary and made things perfectly clear to him", "?", "She was 18 when *he got her pregnant*, you mean. Considering how terrible your MIL is, I\u2019d take her opinion with a whole shaker of salt."]}
