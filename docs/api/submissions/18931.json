Heart rates go up while exercising and having a good time in the bedroom. So I think you should have taken it as a compliment if her fun time with you sounds were actually similar to her dominating in the gym sounds.

Some people just make strange sounds. Some people sound like they're dying, whether that's working out or having sex. Some are like ninjas. I don't think many people plan that stuff out.

If she really was, you\u2019d think she would try a different workout, let him know, quit, or at the very LEAST try to hide it. Nope. She moaned loud and proud and defended herself as if its alright.

It's a standard protocol and guys are making noise at the gym all the time.\n\nYou and anyone else bothered by a woman making noise while lifting and not noticing the gym bros doing the same damn thing are being sexist. \n\nThat it makes you or anyone else thinks about sex reflects you and their states of mind. Auditory expression during vigorous physical activity is likely to sound similar across activities.

Your logic amuses me however. Very curious why you made it about gender and how it would be better for my gf that a stranger comes and tells her she isn\u2019t allowed to moan rather than her bf asking her to try other techniques.", "It\u2019s not about gender whatsoever. There\u2019s gym etiquette that should be common knowledge. Some noise is to be expected in a gym.

I didn't causate anything.", "I watch women's tennis and don't remember ever hearing someone say they're outright moaning. I've heard some say it *sounds* like they're moaning. To me, the two sounds are different, even in tennis. It doesn't sound like moaning to me, but grunting. But that's besides the point, there's a difference between the two types of workouts. Hitting a tennis ball naturally will cause someone to make a sound. Running on a treadmill (or cardio in general) hardly ever causes someone to make verbal sounds like either a grunt or a moan. People are focusing on OP talking about noise made during workout, when the what's odd about the situation is moaning during something like a treadmill.\n\nAnd before anyone even says tennis is cardio yet people make noise, the cardio aspect is the running throughout your side of the court, not hitting the ball. That part is anaerobic and those types of exercises very commonly cause people to make noise. If you remove \"attempt at hitting the tennis ball\" from tennis and left everything else, I'd be surprised if someone made verbal sounds aside from breathing heavily, or something close to that.\n\nFor example, in track and field, people doing 100m hardly make a sound, but people doing shotput grunt.\n\nBased on OP's story, which I still don't know if this is real or fake, I think the GF might be trolling him.", "Ah yes, the vague, all-emcompassing \"workout noises.\" What workout noises do you make on a treadmill? Is it the same as when lifting weights? Different types of workout produce different common types of sounds. But since we're trying to oversimplify things, preparing in cooking can be workout for the arms. Do you expect people to moan then? Let's not be disingenuous.\n\nWhat workout noises do you make when cycling? Surely it's not moaning like you're having sex.\n\nEdit: lol nah don't just downvote, answer the question. You moan when on s treadmill? Do you even grunt when in a treadmill?", "Omg, the little death song. That's hilarious.", "Indeed you do, *but* that\u2019s more of a second offense after the denial thing, I\u2019d think.

He just said that's what it sounds like and it's also making the people around stare. He never said it's sexual, he said it sounds sexual. The same sound that people *correlate* with pleasure, e.g. sex, is making people understandably put off.
