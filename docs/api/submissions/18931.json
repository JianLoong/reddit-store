You just asked her to stop? NTA and I would find this extremely awkward as a gym goer.", "NTA - you did not embarass her! She did it herself.

There is a woman at my gym who does this and it's very irritating. I'm in the UK where people aren't generally super loud, and my gym is particularly quiet. People go, do their work out, and go home. Thankfully gym selfie culture doesn't exist there as it's a residents gym. But this one woman, who doesn't even seem to be exerting herself makes such loud noises, I've seen people turn around and walk put when they see her there. Everyone glares at her, or purposely adjusts their headphones. I imagine she either doesn't care or enjoys the attention, but she sounds like one of those loud tennis players when all she's doing is a soft workout on the cross trainer or pulling down some rope weights. It is very embarassing to be in the presence of it, and I imagine far more so if you are actually with the person.", "NTA! I wouldn\u2019t wanna go to the gym with someone who sounds like they\u2019re having sex on the treadmill lmaoooooo.

Easily solved though, just stick to your word not to work out with her anymore.  Clearly your gym behavior embarrasses her and hers embarrasses you so just don't do that anymore.", "NTA I can understand how this could be really awkward and embarrassing. Is it possible for you to sit down with your girlfriend and gently explain how it sounded, not just to you but how other people at the gym were clearly noticing and uncomfortable. That you\u2019re not trying to insult or shame her but you wanted her to know how the sounds she made appeared to others, as you would want someone to tell you had your positions been switched. If this is the first time you\u2019ve gone together was she maybe trying to put on a bit of a show for you? Impress you somehow? I\u2019d sit down and try to discuss with her what happened, your feelings and that you want gym time together to be enjoyable for both of you.", "NTA. At least you must not have been working out at Planet Fitness. There you could probably add getting kicked out and banned to the humiliation. If they\u2019ll kick someone out for grunting, imagine how they\u2019d handle your moaning GF.", "YTA.   \nGuys scream like gorillas, but you have a weird insecurity about your GF moaning during workout. Gym isn't a place to go and be a porcelain decoration.", "Excuse me, what?! Guys at the gym i go to beat their chests, give loud high fives and make grunting/ape like noises all the time. And you\u2019re worried about her moaning. Grow tf up. You\u2019re TA.", "YTA. I\u2019m sure if you\u2019d stop and think about it, grunting is grunting, and a lot of people do it at the gym. The only reason you\u2019re sexualizing this person\u2019s grunts is 1- she\u2019s a woman 2- she\u2019s your gf. Men\u2019s grunting at the gym can sound just as sexual, but no one is at the gym to be seen or heard: they\u2019re there to work out.", "YTA. As another commenter said, grunting is grunting. It's also likely not on purpose. It's like telling someone to stop going to the toilet. It's a normal thing.", "ESH. Others will ALWAYS stare if you\u2019re not quiet, those who drop stuff or shout in the gym when doing heavy deadlifts always get stares. But you can\u2019t assume people are uncomfortable unless their body language is very obvious. \n\nPeople also have different athleticism, the same amount of effort for you may not be the same for your girlfriend, you can not shame her for that. I think you need to sort out having a low view of her as it seems you just wanted to be named NTA, but both of you need to sit down and talk privately when you\u2019re both calm. As this type of issue is small and needs to be sorted out, were you trying to embarrass her? Or just tell her you were uncomfortable because she may have assumed the embarrassment reason. \n\nIt also depends in which way that you told her to stop meaning. Did you tell her to tone it down and stop or say it loudly and try to embarrass her?", "Yta for slut shaming your gf for pleasuring herself at the gym with you all watching", "OP it sounds like if this is the first time you've worked out with her, then she's just looking for attention, which moaning in a gym like you described isn't the first time it's happened.  Go with her suggestion of just not working out with her and that way you can avoid any future disagreements.  You'll never be able to figure out why she did what she did, so the best thing to do is just move on and not mention it again.", "ESH or YWBTA, only because I can't tell whether the volume of the 'moaning' is exaggerated in its loudness, or whether it's simply a rather normal volume for a moan/grunt/groan/etc which is pretty common in gyms, but you're being hyper-aware to it because she's your gf and you're at the gym with her.\n\nShe might be playing up the moaning for attention, which you've stated might be the case in the comments :/ Orrrr she might simply be wired that way to moan during physical exertion and you're just sensitive to it.\n\nTBH I'd just crank the volume on my earphones up if she really is being as loud and distracting as you say-- I'm sure some gym-goer will let her know eventually. I don't think something like this is worth having a huge argument over TBH.", "YTA lots of people moan and grunt while exercising. Also, bedroom noises are different for different people. Heart rates go up while exercising and having a good time in the bedroom. So I think you should have taken it as a compliment if her fun time with you sounds were actually similar to her dominating in the gym sounds. I think the embarrassing part for her comes in with how you told her to stop. While a lot of people have sex, most of us don't want our partner announcing it in public and definitely don't want them letting people know what we sound like in bed.", "yikes ESH", "YTA. Stop telling women what they can and can\u2019t do with their bodies.", "NTA. This would make me *super* uncomfortable to witness.", "YTA. Sounds like you don\u2019t even like your girlfriend.", "I told her that she was being loud and to stop moaning because it sounded like when we had sex. Suggested to concentrate on breathing because it helps a lot with the reps etc", " I imagine she either doesn't care or enjoys the attention, but she sounds like one of those loud tennis players when all she's doing is a soft workout on the cross trainer or pulling down some rope weights.", "I used to work at and I still work out at a planet fitness and I have NEVER seen that alarm go off.", "It is NOT a thing. Maybe a grunt or heavy breathing when it\u2019s getting too heavy can escape some people but no not the moaning she\u2019s doing", "Sounds like just wanting attention. The woman who does this at my gym is 100% doing it for attention.", "I thought she was enjoying it too tbh and maybe it is fine so I don\u2019t know", "As someone who has partaken in both activities, I can't imagine making the same sounds. Maybe I'm running wrong?", "I\u2019m not their partner to tell them off", "On a treadmill? What? Homie... Nah.", "I've never once heard a guy at the gym grunting in any way similar to sexual.  Grunting is not grunting lol.  \n\nAlso, any trainer is generally going to point out that grunting is not helping you unless you are doing a max, which obviously isn't the case here.\n\nIf I was doing something fuckin weird and didn't know it, and everyone was looking at me like I was a goofball, I'd be upset if my partner didn't tell me I look like a goofball.", "Take it easy with the woman/man thing.

It's clearly a joke", "Why is this about men and women?", "But if she were a man it would no doubt be okay with you", "wellllll the part about sounding like sex is objectively funny to me as observer, but maybe wasn\u00b4t the best choice of words at that time.\n\nYou are still NTA unless others in the gym heard you say that to her, that would be assholish to say \"quit moaning you sound like you are having sex\" within earshot of others so they could laugh at her.

It can sound sexual coming from anyone. Whether or not it\u2019s helpful is another story. People do it, it\u2019s not harmful and it\u2019s not up to anyone to police how someone works out.
