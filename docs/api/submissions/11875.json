I'm originally American but moved to Norway when I was 19 to get a college education without paying an arm and a dick. I met Maya when I was 20 and we've been together ever since. We recently got engaged and our wedding is planned for this fall. I wanted to tell my family in person about it so we planned a trip to visit my hometown to announce it. This is the third time my parents (55M and 52F) are meeting her in person and the first for more distant relatives. We had a big dinner at my aunt's (57F, Debra) house where we announced it and most of my family was ecstatic and congratulated us. My mom, Debra and one other aunt did not look that happy.\n\nI didn't really pay it much mind at first, but as the evening progressed, Maya told me she felt super uncomfortable with the glares she was getting from the three of them. She's quite shy and not very confident in her English, so we talked in Norwegian between the two of us for the most part. Of course when talking with my family we spoke English, but I started to feel the chill from my mother's glares whenever the two of us were talking. I told Maya I'd be right back and I talked with my dad about what the deal was. He just kinda shrugged and told me, \"You know how your mom gets with women you're seeing, don't worry about it she's just upset to see that her son is putting roots down an ocean away.\" He was wrong about not needing to worry. After dessert, my mom stood up and gave a toast:\n\n\"Cheers to my son and his fianc\u00e9, she may not be the best woman for him, but I'm sure he'll realize that once he sees what a slut and gold digger she is. Or maybe she'll grow a conscious and saves him from himself. Cheers.\"\n\nMaya left the room crying and there was a long silence (aside from my mom and aunts snickering) before I broke in and said: \"You realize that the choice for who the most important women in my life is hasn't had you in the running for nearly a decade. I actually love her and would choose a kick to the nuts over you. The three of you aren't welcome at the wedding and Maya and I will be staying at a hotel for the rest of our time here.\" And then I left as quickly as possible with Maya.\n\nI feel bad for putting Maya through that and don't want her to have to deal with anything like that on what's supposed to be the one of the happiest days of our lives, but at the same time I've been getting calls from my family about how unreasonable I'm being, that my mom was drunk and is just worried about me, etc. etc. My sister (who is NC with our mother) told me that I royally fucked up and probably burned most of the bridges with our family, or least our mother's side. And a lot of my mother's side have said they won't come unless I reinvite my mom and aunts. My dad said he can't come unless my mom can go, and he really wants to be there. IDK what to do and Maya said it's my choice but she really doesn't want them there. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: My sister isn't siding with my mom's side of the family. She knows that I want to have my family in my life and so me royally fucking up is in reference to that as well as the fact that she knows my dad probably won't be able to come because of this.

There is no going back from this.  His mom is toxic and sounds like she always has been.  NC forever and given sounds like you will be living in Norway, it won't be hard to implement.  But I am sorry, it sucks to have a mother like that.  Hope you make a good life with your fiance in Norway.", "I couldn't include it in the post, but my mom is very enmeshed with me and is part of the reason I moved. She's a narcissist and my childhood was very much a golden child scapegoat dynamic with me and my sister. Our relationship is much better now, but my sister has a panic attack every time she meets my mom and that's probably the biggest reason she's NC.", "Granted, there was only 1 line (unless I missed something in the post), but I more read that as the NC sister saying that OP made a mistake by bringing his fiancee around his mother, not saying the mother was right in this situation.", "Just because most norwegians speak english well does not mean all do.\n\nEnglish is taught in danish schools too, but when my friend started ldr with a girl from the Philippines, he would send her english texts to me, id translate to danish and return it to him, he would send me his answer in danish and id translate to english so he could send it to her", "Her English is great, it's more about being self conscious about her accent. My mother made a comment the first time we had a video call and she's been uncomfortable talking to my family in English ever since. It also doesn't help most of my family has a thick, rural Minnesotan accent which she finds difficult to understand. I would've included that in the post but character limits.", "My father is in the least enviable position I can think of: between a rock and my mother. I'm trying to think of ways that he could come, but unfortunately my mother would almost definitely find out.", "Some in-laws are nutjobs, and deserve to be demoted to \"funny story\". No reflection on OP or their marriage.", "She's not siding with her, she just said that I probably won't be able to have a relationship with my mom's side, which, while she doesn't want that, she knows I wanna have my dad and family in my life", "Can't elope, her parents have already started putting down deposits and making reservations. They already have an appointment to get me fitted for a bunad when we get back. Most of my dads family is sane and they agree that my mom was so beyond the line that I can't invite her.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more. As for the extending moms side of the family. I\u2019ll quote some wise words \u201cBye, Felicia.\u201d\n\nOP mom sucks, and I can honestly say I got a good chuckle out of the picking a swift kick to the balls over picking mom. OP is so NTA.", "This is it OP. This is the reality. \n\n\nYou didn\u2019t start a damn thing and you certainly didn\u2019t fan any flames. Your mom played a toxic game of fuck around and now she\u2019s going to find out. \n\nMarry Maya, move an ocean away, and be happy without that kind of bullshit in your life.", "Great insights", "I was incredibly surprised she said that (as was my dad and his entire side of the family), but she's never been drunk around Maya, so I guess her filter was completely gone. I very much wish this wasn't real.", "Yeah, and point out that he's standing by his drunken abusive wife, who has a pattern of cruel behavior, and you are standing by the kind woman, a guest in her home, to whom she said unforgivable things. Ask him if he feels as good about that choice as you do.", "> And tell your father that you are standing by your wife the same way he is standing by his.\n\nThis. From man to man, he'll understand.", "Its only impossible if your dad makes it that way. He an adult and can choose to have a relationship with you regardless of your relationship with your mom.", "I get that but your dad is an adult who makes his own choices. If the way his wife emotionally abuses his kids is not enough to make him pick a side well then he has already picked the wrong side. Sorry, your family sucks, enjoy your new life in Norway. I hear the Scandinavian countries are some of the happiest.", "I understand you want your father at your wedding. But as it means also having your mum, are you sure about that?\n\nIf she does this while you are celebrating your engagement with your family, imagine what she'll do at the wedding.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 and yourself will be worried the whole time what stunt she'll pull. Will you actually enjoy what should be one of the milestones of your lives?\n\nAt this point, isn't it time your father stepped up and told you he wants to attend the wedding of you, his son, even if your mom's not invited? With his current behaviour your father is enabling your mom.", "god, i am so sorry :( maybe it\u2019s time for those bridges to burn? your sister did the right thing by going NC with your mom, maybe it\u2019s your turn? i can\u2019t imagine how bad the enmeshment is, but this could be your chance to finally break away from her. marry your amazing fianc\u00e9e, go wherever you wanna go, you\u2019re allowed to be your own person without your mom being there all the time. for the sake of your wedding and everything that\u2019ll come after, don\u2019t invite your mom and aunts back. if your mom\u2019s side is going to defend that behavior, it\u2019s not worth keeping them in your life", "Ah maybe confused me alot lol", "In my experience its 100% at that age level.", "Your a good friend", "No worries. \n\nNTA btw. Your family sounds terrible. Don\u2019t back down and have your fiance\u2019s back.", "He should proudly tell he\u2019s going.  No reason to hide from this crazy lady.  Who does what she did?  Only serious narcissists and then of course it gets blamed on \u201cnot my fault\u201d.  Honestly if she did come I would make sure she is seated in the back at the child\u2019s section.", "OP, I have a regrettably similar situation and am NC with my mother, which by extension means NC with my dad. My father has four children - only one of us is still in (low) contact, because my mother has made it impossible.\n\nI will say to you what I said to my sister a while ago, when she was talking about dad: at every step on the journey to NC, he has made a choice, and he has never chosen his children.\n\nYour father isn't an innocent, aggrieved party who's woken up one day in an impossible position. He is exactly where he's chosen to be.", "This is going to be hard for him, but it's really important for him to finally have to face this mess head on.  He may be a kind person, and almost certainly he's been emotionally abused by her, but he really failed to protect his children. If he decides that keeping the boat steady is more important than a relationship with you and your new family, and the only support he will give you is lip service about how sorry he is and that's \"just how she is,\" please, cut that boat loose.", "If he\u2019s afraid of his wife, maybe continuing the marriage isn\u2019t the best idea.", "But this isn't an example of the crazy uncle who tries to pinch the fiance's butt.  That could be overlooked as an \"eccentric\" moment.  This goes so far beyond that I don't see how the bride could ever forgive or want to be anywhere near that woman.", "Then I would say forgiving your mother and aunts over this means choosing them over your fianc\u00e9e", "You know what the answer is.  Get married in Norway, invite your dad\u2019s side of the family and your sister, and don\u2019t look back.  Your dad made his choice a long time ago, and it wasn\u2019t his children.  As hard as it is, it\u2019s time to step away.  Let your dad know if he ever decides to make better choices the door will be open for him, but don\u2019t hold your breath he\u2019ll ever step through it unless your mother dies (in which case, it will be meaningless because he never really made the choice for himself).  NTA", "Sounds like you should just go forward without inviting any jerks, then.  In any event, yeah, NTA.", "If any family member tries to use her being drunk and no filter as an excuse, you should tell them to pound sand. That's absolutely no excuse. If a filter is removed, it's basically her true thoughts coming out."]}
