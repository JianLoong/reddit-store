I'm originally American but moved to Norway when I was 19 to get a college education without paying an arm and a dick. I met Maya when I was 20 and we've been together ever since. We recently got engaged and our wedding is planned for this fall. I wanted to tell my family in person about it so we planned a trip to visit my hometown to announce it. This is the third time my parents (55M and 52F) are meeting her in person and the first for more distant relatives. We had a big dinner at my aunt's (57F, Debra) house where we announced it and most of my family was ecstatic and congratulated us. My mom, Debra and one other aunt did not look that happy.\n\nI didn't really pay it much mind at first, but as the evening progressed, Maya told me she felt super uncomfortable with the glares she was getting from the three of them. She's quite shy and not very confident in her English, so we talked in Norwegian between the two of us for the most part. Of course when talking with my family we spoke English, but I started to feel the chill from my mother's glares whenever the two of us were talking. I told Maya I'd be right back and I talked with my dad about what the deal was. He just kinda shrugged and told me, \"You know how your mom gets with women you're seeing, don't worry about it she's just upset to see that her son is putting roots down an ocean away.\" He was wrong about not needing to worry. After dessert, my mom stood up and gave a toast:\n\n\"Cheers to my son and his fianc\u00e9, she may not be the best woman for him, but I'm sure he'll realize that once he sees what a slut and gold digger she is. Or maybe she'll grow a conscious and saves him from himself. Cheers.\"\n\nMaya left the room crying and there was a long silence (aside from my mom and aunts snickering) before I broke in and said: \"You realize that the choice for who the most important women in my life is hasn't had you in the running for nearly a decade. I actually love her and would choose a kick to the nuts over you. The three of you aren't welcome at the wedding and Maya and I will be staying at a hotel for the rest of our time here.\" And then I left as quickly as possible with Maya.\n\nI feel bad for putting Maya through that and don't want her to have to deal with anything like that on what's supposed to be the one of the happiest days of our lives, but at the same time I've been getting calls from my family about how unreasonable I'm being, that my mom was drunk and is just worried about me, etc. etc. My sister (who is NC with our mother) told me that I royally fucked up and probably burned most of the bridges with our family, or least our mother's side. And a lot of my mother's side have said they won't come unless I reinvite my mom and aunts. My dad said he can't come unless my mom can go, and he really wants to be there. IDK what to do and Maya said it's my choice but she really doesn't want them there. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: My sister isn't siding with my mom's side of the family. She knows that I want to have my family in my life and so me royally fucking up is in reference to that as well as the fact that she knows my dad probably won't be able to come because of this.

If he doesn't attend the wedding then he cares more about avoiding an argument with his wife than witnessing one of the most important moments of your life. Stop making excuses for him.", "NTA. Disinviting them from the wedding was a completely reasonable reaction. A wedding is supposed to be a celebration of a couple who have chosen to spend their lives together. Why would you want people there who don\u2019t support your relationship and disrespect your fianc\u00e9? You did the right thing for yourself and Maya. Your mom and aunts are so toxic", "Very much NTA but the phrase \u201carm and a dick\u201d had me on your side regardless", "NTA! I'd have run for the HILLS if that had been my husband's family's response to our engagement and his response hadn't been the exact same as yours! Your priorities are on mark; don't correct them.\n\nI've seen your comments mentioning the hard position your father is in, and I feel for you, I really do. Unfortunately, your father is in a hard position of his OWN making. There is no such thing as a peace-keeper in abusive situations, only bystanders and enablers. Your father is choosing his relationship with his wife over that with his children, and that is so very, very sad for you, and also for him. He might not see he has a choice or that he is making one, but he does have one, and he is. What would be the negative outcome for him coming to your wedding without your mother? A conflict, probably a bad one. Avoiding that is worth missing his son's wedding? What else will he miss down the line, to avoid these conflicts and enable her abusive behavior? Holidays? Grandchildren? \n\nKeep protecting your future wife and the family you are building together, and make sure your father knows he has a place in your life without your mother, if he chooses to take it.", "No. No. Nope.

What your mother said, publicly like that, is unforgivable IMO, I don\u2019t care what she drank.  There is no way she would get within a mile of my wedding, I would cut her out of my life in a heartbeat.  I can\u2019t believe how your relatives are sticking up for after what she said!

Make it clear that HE is invited, your mother is NOT invited, and if he refuses to come without her that's his choice.  \n\nAlso prepare to have someone run interference/call the police if your mother (and/or her flying monkeys) show up uninvited.

I would go NC and let it be known that you will not put up with anyone abusing Maya. Cause that's what she did.", "NTA.\n\nAnd do not allow your malicious mother and aunts at your wedding. If your dad chooses to flag pure loyalty to them over any love for you, or decent behavior from your mother- well, it\u2019s sad he\u2019s also chosen to skip your wedding.\n\nYour mother\u2019s behavior was inexcusable.

If he chooses his wife well that's his right but don't lower your boundaries with her.", "NTA. Marry Maya without your family. They've shown they don't support your marriage.

Why should your sweet angel fiance put up with a lifetime of abuse from your mother (which she will)....a mother you LITERALLY CROSSED AN OCEAN TO GET AWAY FROM", "I think you might need to do some research into emotional/covert incest, which is a specific form of enmeshment.  This is a form of abuse and is not healthy.  Signs of this are (not not all need to be present):\n\n**Relying on the child for support**: This may include talking with the child about their relationship problems, seeking the child to console or comfort them, or asking the child for inappropriate advice.\n\n**Putting their needs before their child\u2019s**: The caregiver may want endless praise and love from the child or seek to be the most important person in the child\u2019s life while at the same time hurting the child\u2019s other relationships.\n\n**Invading the child\u2019s privacy**: Examples include entering the child\u2019s personal space frequently or preventing the child from having a space of their own. The caregiver may also do things that make the child feel awkward, such as ignoring the child\u2019s wish for privacy when they are nude or being nude around the child.\n\n**Using the child like a love-life partner**: This could consist of taking the child on dates, discussing their sex life, or making explicit comments about the child\u2019s body or appearance. The caregiver may also insist that the child call them names typically reserved for adult relationships. However, in cases of emotional incest, there is no sexual contact.\n\n**Feeling jealous of the child\u2019s relationships**: When the child becomes an adult, the parent or caregiver may become envious of their romantic relationships. They may compete for attention, intrude on, or attempt to sabotage them.", "Did Maya know about this? I just have to wonder how you thought it would pan out knowing how your mother is.

He\u2019s a grown man who has every power in the world to tell his wife she\u2019s being a witch and, for once, is choosing the well being of his children. He is choosing not to because he thinks it\u2019s too hard or \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to deal with\u201d your mother. That is a *choice*. Just like you had a choice to defend your fianc\u00e9e or fall in line with your mother. Saying it\u2019s too hard is pure chicken shit. Everything is hard. You choose which hard you think is worth it. Your father does not feel this is worth it. You have your own choice now. A choice you must make, on your own, for you.
