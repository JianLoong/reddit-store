{"id": 11875, "submission_id": "11mxwxa", "title": "AITA for uninviting my mother and aunts from my wedding after what they said about my fiance?", "selftext": "I (25M) am extremely lucky to be marrying the woman of my dreams, \"Maya\" (24F). I'm originally American but moved to Norway when I was 19 to get a college education without paying an arm and a dick. I met Maya when I was 20 and we've been together ever since. We recently got engaged and our wedding is planned for this fall. I wanted to tell my family in person about it so we planned a trip to visit my hometown to announce it. This is the third time my parents (55M and 52F) are meeting her in person and the first for more distant relatives. We had a big dinner at my aunt's (57F, Debra) house where we announced it and most of my family was ecstatic and congratulated us. My mom, Debra and one other aunt did not look that happy.\n\nI didn't really pay it much mind at first, but as the evening progressed, Maya told me she felt super uncomfortable with the glares she was getting from the three of them. She's quite shy and not very confident in her English, so we talked in Norwegian between the two of us for the most part. Of course when talking with my family we spoke English, but I started to feel the chill from my mother's glares whenever the two of us were talking. I told Maya I'd be right back and I talked with my dad about what the deal was. He just kinda shrugged and told me, \"You know how your mom gets with women you're seeing, don't worry about it she's just upset to see that her son is putting roots down an ocean away.\" He was wrong about not needing to worry. After dessert, my mom stood up and gave a toast:\n\n\"Cheers to my son and his fianc\u00e9, she may not be the best woman for him, but I'm sure he'll realize that once he sees what a slut and gold digger she is. Or maybe she'll grow a conscious and saves him from himself. Cheers.\"\n\nMaya left the room crying and there was a long silence (aside from my mom and aunts snickering) before I broke in and said: \"You realize that the choice for who the most important women in my life is hasn't had you in the running for nearly a decade. I actually love her and would choose a kick to the nuts over you. The three of you aren't welcome at the wedding and Maya and I will be staying at a hotel for the rest of our time here.\" And then I left as quickly as possible with Maya.\n\nI feel bad for putting Maya through that and don't want her to have to deal with anything like that on what's supposed to be the one of the happiest days of our lives, but at the same time I've been getting calls from my family about how unreasonable I'm being, that my mom was drunk and is just worried about me, etc. etc. My sister (who is NC with our mother) told me that I royally fucked up and probably burned most of the bridges with our family, or least our mother's side. And a lot of my mother's side have said they won't come unless I reinvite my mom and aunts. My dad said he can't come unless my mom can go, and he really wants to be there. IDK what to do and Maya said it's my choice but she really doesn't want them there. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: My sister isn't siding with my mom's side of the family. She knows that I want to have my family in my life and so me royally fucking up is in reference to that as well as the fact that she knows my dad probably won't be able to come because of this.\n\nEdit 2: I did not expect this much response and I did not expect so many comments regarding my father. I don't want to cut him out of my life but there have been so many great comments that have made me really question some things. After talking with Maya we both agree that since he is someone I do genuinely care about, I should give him one chance to actually decide whether he wants to be a part of my life going forward. I just got off the phone with my father, and I asked him to have a one on one. He agreed and I will be meeting him in a couple of hours. I made a big list of points I want to cover based off of several comments I've seen here. I want to specifically shout out u/BlueRFR3100 for his phrasing of standing by my soon-to-be wife. That really made me think and I think it will help my father see my side. From what he said and how he sounded on the call I am hopeful that he sees just how toxic my mother's behavior was, not only regarding the toast but over the course of my and my sisters lives.\n\nEdit 2.5: Almost forgot to mention this but 1. the wedding is happening near Maya's hometown and 2. elopement is not an option nor do either of us want it to be. Maya's family is very supportive and I'm excited to have a traditional Norwegian wedding.", "created_utc": 1678382443, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mxwxa/aita_for_uninviting_my_mother_and_aunts_from_my/", "score": 2085, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The caregiver may also insist that the child call them names typically reserved for adult relationships. However, in cases of emotional incest, there is no sexual contact.\n\n**Feeling jealous of the child\u2019s relationships**: When the child becomes an adult, the parent or caregiver may become envious of their romantic relationships.

I will get to know him, if they get married, I will attend the wedding and I will be involved in my son/grandkid's lives.  I don't have to have permission to do so and will not be asking for it.  When you love a kid and you understand that some parents do unfortunately put conditions the parent who loves unconditionally needs to stand up for the child (even when they are adult) and say, yeah, I get it - we are married but this is not something I will change.  A mother's love should not be conditional on what makes her happy it should be on ensuring her son feels loved and like he can come to her and share his life.\n\nYou seem pretty mature, and you did the right thing by uninviting them- what they did to your fianc\u00e9 is outrageous and you don't have to tolerate that.
