They also said no juice, only water bottles. And every pizza slice has to be individually boxed.\n\nThe pizza place we were thinking can't accommodate any of this, and trying to source one that might is looking like $90 for just the pizza alone, the big thing was the boxes. We also think such a plain pizza party kinda defeats the purpose of celebration.

The school had to come up with a food policy without much notice, and since they are the ones who would be liable if someone got sick, or if they violated a student's 504 plan (assuming US, insert whatever the equivalent is if a different country), it is unsurprising that they want more restrictions rather than fewer.  But if the restrictions are too onerous for you, you are not an asshole for saying you can't comply and therefore will not be providing pizza.", "How insane of the school to tell you how to bring the food you offered to bring.

When they want to more than double the price, you are free to say that doesn't work for you.\n\nI would ask some other parents and the principal about this.  Who expects pizza to be vegan?  Even gluten free for the entire class is a bit much.  Pizza is a staple of school lunches.  I would be surprised if they no longer serve those because some kids are GF.
