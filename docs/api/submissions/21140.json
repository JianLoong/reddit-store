Which included my aunt and her two grandsons (3M,6M) and my brother (25M). At the end of the parade there was a carnival. I took my daughter to the parade and the plan was to only take her to the parade not to the carnival. You could see the top of the Farris wheel from where we sat. Of course my daughter seen it and wanted to go. The answer was no. Simply because there is also another carnival next weekend that she can go too. I did not want to pay $100 two weekend in a row. Of course my brother speaks up and tells her he will take her. My stance was still no, I am not paying for it. He can take her and pay but I am not. So he did. He was stuck paying for her wrist band and his own to ride with her. I did pay for her to play a game that she wanted to play. Fast forward to this morning my mom calls me wanting to know why I wouldn\u2019t pay for my child to go to the carnival. I told her that the only reason why she got to go was because my brother told her that he would take her. Other than that the answer was no she could not go because she was going next weekend. My mother now thinks I\u2019m an AH who used my brother to pay. She also thinks I\u2019m an asshole for taking my daughter to a parade but not wanting to take her to the carnival. Am I the AH here? I really don\u2019t think I am.\n\n*** edit to add*** I could have taken her to the carnival yesterday and skipped next weekend. I told her no, and that should be only answer that she needs.

We don\u2019t get carnivals. The major annual event is the Sheepdog Trials. It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like, except there are a shit load of beer tents. And gin tents. And specialist cheese tents. No Cheese Roll though, unfortunately\n\n https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K40o7eiFEOQ\n\nBut attending  the Sheepdog Trials costs a bloody fortune! You do tend to get a hand stamp of a sheep though - so totally worth the entry fee.\n\nI can totally see how a carnival could easily cost \u00a3100.", "Hahahaha oh I love that so much \ud83d\ude02 that\u2019s perfect, please don\u2019t mind if I reuse that name in the future.", "NTA, you and your husband are doing an awesome job as a parent.  You are teaching your daughter that she cannot have everything she sees and wants.  Your family on the other hand are teacher her to be an entitled brat.   You need to send them a list of rules for being around your child.  The first being if mom and dad say no, they cannot undermine you and give it to her.", "op=NTA\n\nyou said no.  They said yes--they pay for their yes.", "NTA. But when you said \"no\", you should have taken her home after the parade. Allowing others to override your authority teaches your child she doesn't have to listen to you, because you aren't the one who decides \u2014 she is.", "NTA.", "\"I shouldn't have to feel like an asshole for saying no to her\"\n\nThis, op!! Your family is undermining your parenting. You're absolutrly right, she's two. This is not only a good age to practice saying no, but her learning to cope with that, to accept on some level, delayed gratification, which she will use and need for a lifetime. \n\nYou have a good head about this, imo. You are right, She does not need to do every single thing that comes her way, and if anything, that's going to be a problem for her in the future. An honest discussion with mom and brother is in order, making it clear you feel undermined, and while it's fine to have the occasional family spoiling, it should never, ever come after refuting your own parental choices. And if they can't accept that, maybe family needs a break from kiddo for a while!", "NTA. Ok to say no", "This right here !!! It does not hurt a child to be told no. Her daughter is 2, and it's a lot easier to start to teach the child the meaning of no, and when told no, that means no. Relatives need to learn the same. When the actual parents say no, that's it. No arguing.", "Absolutely NTA. You and her father agreed on next weekend, and she knew that. The rest of the family needs to respect your authority and role as her parent and stop trying to override every single decision you make.", "NTA. This here is why we are LC with my SIL. With my sister if I say my daughter has had enough treats today, take her out but don\u2019t fill her up, she won\u2019t bring her back at dinner time with a belly full of sweets. My SIL always has an excuse ready \u201coh it\u2019s the holidays, oh it\u2019s the weekend, oh it\u2019s Easter, oh you only live once\u201d. Even if a visit goes smoothly, I\u2019m constantly on edge waiting for the other shoe to drop. And afterwards I\u2019m left with the sugared up child who begs and begs to go on all the rides and eat all the food that she did with SIL. It\u2019s hard for a small child to understand moderation and one offs. Once Pandora\u2019s box has been opened it\u2019s game over. Which is why it\u2019s important the parents should be the ones to make that choice because they\u2019ll be the ones dealing with the fallout.", "All this will do is teach her that if Mom or Dad say no, she can run crying to Grandma or uncle and get whatever she wants", "NTA at all. You made a plan that worked for your family. Your brother made a kind offer and you took him up on it.\n\nYour daughter is 2. Give her something shiny and she would forget about the carnival, and then be doubly excited when she goes to the one next weekend and remembers", "Definitely NTA. your brother makes you do something you don\u2019t want to do then whines about having to pay for it? What? No. You are totally nta here", "Ok I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but you are a total stick in the mud.  If money is an issue, and I mean a real issue, that\u2019s one thing.  If it\u2019s not, your trying to be a Drill Sergeant to your daughter instead of a dad.  Your not an asshole, just think about your daughter more.", "Absolutely this! When my daughter was 2, we were at the beach with my husband\u2019s sisters and all their kids and one of his sisters asked if my daughter could have skittles, and I said yes, thinking she was going to give her 5 or 6 skittles. She handed her an unopened king size bag for her to keep. I told my daughter she could have 10 skittles now or ice cream when we got back to her grandparents\u2019 house, which had been the plan. She chose 10 skittles now and counted them out and was perfectly content. We got back to the house and the same sister asked her if she wanted ice cream and she said \u201cI had skittles.\u201d My sister in law turned to me and was like, \u201care you really not going to let her have ice cream with her cousins?!\u201d I told her no and that she\u2019s 2 and doesn\u2019t need a ton of sugar and she just couldn\u2019t believe that my kid was just accepting of this and not throwing a tantrum because her 7 year old was whining about wanting a second ice cream and he\u2019d also had a king size bag of skittles at the beach. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever told her kids no and when we get together there\u2019s a lot more meltdowns from her kids over not getting their way than my kids have ever displayed. I\u2019m not saying my kids never have meltdowns, but it\u2019s near constant with hers.", "I had a cat called Lucy Fur. \ud83d\ude01", "YTA\n\n>I told her no, and that should be only answer that she needs. My child is two and doesn\u2019t need to do everything that comes across her path. She\u2019s my only child, my parents only grandchild and my siblings only niece. Every time I say \u201cno\u201d they come running saying \u201cyes\u201d.\n\nBecause of this. If you say no then they come running saying yes, you still said no so you can say no to them as well.\n\nIf you say no then they come running and pay and you accept, it absolutely sounds like you're manipulating or expecting them to pay.\n\nAlso the first part. I told her no so that's all she needs? It's a job of a parent to TEACH, they don't understand why you said no, authoritarian isn't being a good parent and certainly isn't teaching your child anything. If you can't take the effort to say we're coming next week instead I don't know what to say. Being terse, insisting that a no is all you need and giving in so your no's become yes's when other people pay are all dick moves.", "NTA. Kids that young won\u2019t remember any of it anyway, plus she gets to do it next weekend."]}
