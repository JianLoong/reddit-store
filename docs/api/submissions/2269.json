OP, you\u2019re right to point it out. She didn\u2019t grow up in that mentality, and she clearly still doesn\u2019t understand it, or takes the time to listen and understand the burden, so she doesn\u2019t get to speak about it, which I assume she\u2019s only doing because attention seeking.", "NTA. The fact that she does not have some of the experiences you've described and makes it her matter to become the spokesperson with the voice of her own experiences that are seemingly very different from yours and your collective experience is pretty self centered.

She\u2019s definitely enthusiastic about her faith, and as someone who\u2019d was raised as an evangelical, the only way to represent that enthusiasm is by being loud. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I\u2019m Jewish too, so I get that sometimes low key is the way, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with the way she celebrates the faith. As I\u2019m sure you know, it takes a ton of work to be allowed to convert, and she\u2019s rightly proud of putting in that work. \n\nMeaning to or not, your insistence that she\u2019ll never understand the generational pain that a lot of us have baked into our DNA basically is calling her a fraud.

You are the only one who seems to have a problem with her. Sure, she doesn't have the background but many Jews who do couldn't care less.

I mean by being a part of these cultures everyone will judge and treat you different. By trying to become a part of the culture but not being an accurate stereotype of the representation, will have you judged by both outsiders and people of that culture negatively. \n\nNow i\u2019m not going to say that both experiences are the same as they\u2019re not, but they both will go through net negative experiences and will probably speak on that while thinking it\u2019s the same as the culture they see themselves as.\n\nAnd the way we are treated is certainly affected by all that, but will highly vary due to individualistic encounters. say you meet a person who hated the culture, by the time they encounter the next person of that culture whos to say their reaction and judgment are entirely the same.", "She openly says \"we \\[group\\]\" and \"our history\" when it's objectively not her history.\n\nLike I wrote in the post, my favorite clergy member when I do go to services is a convert. He's awesome. I think his being a convert brings in fresh perspectives and frees him from the whole \"this is how it's always been done\" way of thinking so many people have.

You have no right to decide what people say, no matter how you feel about it.", "Like I said, no problem with her being a member of the faith at all (even if I think her initial reasons for converting are kind of gross, and frankly, I think you would think so too).
