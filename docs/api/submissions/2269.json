She can speak about her personal experiences as a new convert. But is she qualified to say what it's like to be Indian, the culture that most widely practices Hinduism? No, of course not. That would be seen as trying to be \"transracial.\" And while you can argue that not all Indian people are Hindu, the truth is that Indian people *are* impacted by the major religion of their culture even if they are not Hindu themselves. My roommate is not a practicing Hindu, but coming from an Indian Hindu family has many of the same impacts on her that you are describing with other people of your religion. So even if she is nonpracticing, she still has more of a say about Hinduism and Indian culture than a white American active practice would. \n\nI think the issue is that she is not recognizing that your religion also describes your ethnicity (I'm assuming so anyway from the context of your post). So it's okay for her to talk about her relationship with God in the context of your faith but not to talk about how your ethnicity is being represented.  And I think this is the exact word you need to use: ethnicity (or possibly race depending on how you view it).

The question is how important is it to you to maintain the friendship. If you don\u2019t care if she\u2019s mad, cool. No worries. Morally, ethically, you\u2019re in the right. If you do decide for yourself that you\u2019d rather repair, I think it might help to reframe it as a part of evangelical upbringing she\u2019s probably not aware of. It\u2019s part of the privilege of growing up in the group with the most power. Checking our privilege is always hard but we can all learn and grow and do better if we choose to learn why.

She needs to get a grip of reality. \nOP NTA and good on you for letting her know\u2026cuz someone had to. \nDon\u2019t let her gaslight and manipulate you, bc that\u2019s the those type of people\u2019s favorite tactics.", "She sounds insufferable", "As a fellow Jew, NTA. Coverts...yeah I admire the zeal. But conversion does not swear you in to grievance rights. Grievance rights go to those who have direct history. Like family members we'll never get to meet because they got gassed and our branch escaped/managed to hide long enough history.\n\nWhat friend has rights to is the stories and listening from an insider point of view. Understanding and appreciating the history and celebrating it. She may have the religious zeal, but she just *can't* have that other thing, ya know?\n\n\n\n\nAnd this has been, 1am word vomit after speed reading a post, from Pastry\n\nEDIT: I confess, when I was like 10 I wore a yamaka to a seder because I saw it in an older family friend who was a Jewish man's things, and politely asked if I could wear it because it was beautiful and went well with my dress. This woman.....hmmmmmmmmmm", "NTA\n\nA lot of people feel the need to cling to something to feel special because deep down they can't accept that they're just another human being, and this person converted to your faith more for the recognition than for any other reason. I've seen a lot of people like this. Not just related to a religion or a culture, just people being obnoxious for attention and special treatment.", "NTA. at all. she sounds very performative and ignorant. i am not jewish or religious at all really but even I know that the \u201cus\u201d she is referring to are the children, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers of your religion who were and are tortured & murdered for practicing their religion. i would appreciate her effort to be outspoken & devoted, it seems like a fetishization of the religion and is very chauvinistic. she chose to join your religion. she was not born into it and therefore not a product of generations of trauma, discrimination and oppression. if she is so inclined to be active in your community, she should educate herself on how to respectfully immerse herself in the culture while acknowledging the history and significance of those who have ethnic ties to the religion itself - it is not a trend, and if she faced the oppression and abuse that so many of the people who do or have practiced your religion have/do have, i\u2019d be willing to bet she would step away from it without thinking twice. this is such a prime example of performative activism just being cultural appropriation. in todays climate - one eerily similar to that of germany before ww2\u2026the anti- semitism and demonization of jewish people for simply existing, it\u2019s scary and concerning and not acknowledging history allows it to repeat itself. she cannot feel the magnitude of the fear of that happening in the way that jewish people with jewish ancestors can and do. the somber shroud over Judaism is a result of oppression, persecution and genocide. as horrible as the history is, it must be acknowledged to honor those who experienced the worst of the evils first hand. it is so ignorant to try to paint a picture of judaism that does not include it\u2019s history and the victims of it. im sorry that you are having to explain this to her. if she is so devoted to judaism it is mind boggling that she can try to identify with those who have family members who were buried with numbers tattooed on their bodies. she should know better and because you brought this up to her hopefully she will do better.", "NTA. But I\u2019m curious, is she casually strolling through town wearing a Tallit Gadol?", "YTA it\u2019s made up anyway. Just because you were indoctrinated as a child doesn\u2019t make any difference", "Another Jew, completely agree\n\nNTA", "i don\u2019t think OP is shaming her, i think OP is trying to educate her on the experience of being jewish in ethnicity and religion. her experience and relationship with judaism is wildly different than that of a descendant of generations of Jewish people who were killed and tortured.", "Oh I'm not at all religious, but thanks!", "Info: is your friend Trisha Paytas?", "That gets closer to the problem, but I don't think it's exactly the issue OP is describing. She said she supports her friend participating in her religion and culture but takes issue with her friend trying to claim trauma that members of her community have experienced as her own.\n\nInstead of a white person wearing a sari, a closer analogy might be a white Westerner converting to Hinduism and then lecturing others about how they, as a new Hindu convert, personally felt the intergenerational trauma of the Bengal Famine.", "She got hers after the mikveh!", "I am a Jew and I was unable to have my Bat Mitzvah due to our moving around so much ( no synagogues or Hebrew schools near any of the tiny towns we lived in). I had a friend who converted and had a Bat Mitzvah. She held it over my head for the short time we were friends saying she was a better Jew. NTA", "NTA - Someone needed to her *shrug", "\"What do you mean, you people.\" NTA.", "So she\u2019s pulling a Trisha paytas\u2026", "I am dying to know what \u201cmale religious garment\u201d this dodo wears while repping feminism lol. NTA.", "NTA. Religion \u2260 Culture. \n\nRegardless of the religion a convert can speak on the religion. They can critique how others interpret texts, etc. or they can have discussions around what the religion means to them. The culture is an entirely different thing. \n\nA more extreme view is the association with race, religion, and culture. If a person has all 3 they have different experiences to those who only have one or two. A white person could convert to any religion but they would not have the same discrimination based on race as other people in that religion. \n\n\nThis is your culture. Regardless of how much/little faith you have. You have every right to tell her off for the cultural aspects.", "YTA.", "L\u2019chaim", "NTA\nForgive me for my complete ignorance. I was aware of the fact that people were able to convert to Judaism. \nMy question is about the display she complained about. Does anyone know if she was taken seriously? \nI would think that research would have been done before putting up a display that could potentially offend so many people.", "I'm so sorry that happened to you, how awful.", "Imagine headwear.", "That\u2019s good! But she needs to be considerate.", "No problem. When I was growing up, we were supposed to discourage converts. We do need to remind them of what they are taking on: the difficult as well as the hood. Once they convert, however, they are Jews and need to be part of the community. I am Reform snd don\u2019t know as much as I should, but I do know that. We are supposed to be modest. I would say that such a public display of zeal, though it comes from a good source, is not modest.", "Ah okay, I\u2019m really not sure what I was thinking but that sounds equally as ridiculous. It can almost feel mocking when people do this but unfortunately I think she is 100% serious. Good luck ):", "Bwahahaha, I understood that reference! TLW is the best!", "Yeah I can attest to that. Ii got bullied. They would say shit like saying ive got a \"jew nose\" or that my being jewish was weird and when we got to make holiday stuff during a mostly free art period? Guess who's cool dinosaur menorah got destroyed. I also got called a kike a bunch by an ex friend back in 6th grade. He didn't quit till I moved out of state. It sucked, because I had genuinely thought we were good, and had made him a hat that he had asked for. I fucking liked him before the name-calling started. Ugh.", "awareness and experience are not the same thing. she would not be treated the same way that a person with traditionally jewish features would be treated. it\u2019s not a debate. at all. it is compassion and empathy for your fellow humans who have suffered for thousands of years, and acknowledging the frustration of being jewish and watching someone with a white savior complex try to compare to your experience. think about the way black people and white peoples are treated by the police in the US. sure they both interact, and the same outcomes COULD happen, but one is far more likely to experience the negative consequences because of their appearance and racial profiling.", "I am a Jew-by-choice who is does have Ashkenazi ancestors on my Dad\u2019s side, but grew up with only very loose cultural and religious connection to what I now consider my community. Even with this technical claim to inheriting our people\u2019s traumas, I am NOT the descendant of Holocaust survivors and would never ever speak as such. \n\nSide note\u2026 are you really Jewish if you don\u2019t have guilt about not being a \u201cgood enough Jew\u201d? This is a semi genuine question \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Some people just make everything about themselves and she seems to be one of those", "NTA:\n\nShe seems very weird and doesn\u2019t have her own identity figured out; Side note, claiming Jewish men are hot is such an oddly specific thing to say it\u2019s almost creepy.", "Nta", "Are you sure she\\`s out of the evangelical corner?  \nSounds like she has some kind of persecution kink - and is using the 'we' to appear better than she is.\n\nAnd complaining about books? Yeah - sounds she really is not out of the evangelical mindset.\n\nTo be honest - for someone from outside - understanding cultural nuances, religious significance etc - is a daunting task.. and may take a lifetime - but the moment she switched from \"i want to learn\" to \"i know it all and will tell everyone\" - is the moment she went from really faithful to totally religious.\n\nNTA", "May I ask why you are so hesitant to name what is clearly Judaism?", "NTA - I was raised a convert and hold a certain faith very close to my heart and daily life, but I am not a part of the culture, racially, generationally or otherwise. \n\nIt\u2019s a very tricky line to toe in a religion that is so closely intertwined with culture and her zeal in becoming truly involved has become disrespectful. Explaining you\u2019re a convert, empathizing with the persecution, wearing certain clothing and speaking certain prayer does not equate to generational persecution of faith and culture. \n\nI hope that as her conversion and experience matures she will come to realize that her faith is not validated or invalidated by not sharing those aspects of the cultural experience.  \n\nTilaka , yarmulkes, and sajj\u0101da do not equate colonization and genocide.", "Is there a Reason why don't state that you mean Jew/Jewish? \n\nYou're anonymous on Reddit so its kinda weird if People censor themselves that way.", "YTA, the halacha says that once someone converts they are considered Jewish in all ways. Once someone converts, halacha dictates there is no more 'them and us', just the 'us'.\n\nShe is Jewish, so when she talks about Jewish persecution and antisemitism she is talking about her own people. We, as Jews, as a distinct class of people live with the effects of what happened even if we were not personally there during that worst part of our history. The effects have been baked into how we live our life, how we interact with the world, and converts experience that, too. You can talk about a class of people as 'we' or 'us' because you are part of that class without meaning 'me specifically'. I think you're hearing 'us' referring to the overall group, but taking it as a 'me'. \n\nAlso women can wear kippot if they want to, it's not that big a deal.", "NTA - listen, my granny was a convert, love them, but I know *exactly* what you mean when you talk about her evangelical attitude crossing over. Sometimes you have to have that conversation with people, even if it's hard. One should never question a convert's right to be a part of the group (I'm assuming you're Jewish lol) but we are a community and part of community sometimes is checking each other's behaviour, esp when it comes to things that touch the intense and very recent generational trauma a lot of us have.", "ESH, stop caring what she does and focus on your own life.", "This is exactly what I was thinking as I was reading this post  \n\nOP NTA", "As a Jewish person I also read the entire entry from that view lol", "> Jewish prosecution \n\nI think you meant persecution?", "Thank you.", "Yesss I love to see another Jew by Choice \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc95", "I had JW knock on my door a few weeks back, they were so damn confused when I said that I was an Atheistic Jew lmao", "Probably, I wouldn\u2019t know how an Israeli district attorney could help this situation.", "I was in a very bad place during school\nAlready as being a Jew in very conservative areas cost me and my mother a lot .
