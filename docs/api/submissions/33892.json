My boyfriend gets about the same. He spent all of his in two days after Christmas on himself, and already asked me for some of mine. I hesitated because I haven't even had time to THINK about what I've wanted to get for myself, and he took that as me being stingy about it. \nThe thing is I've been a stay at home mom with our daughter for two years now, and I haven't had any of my own income at all... so I never really get to get myself anything nice. (If I ever ask him for anything it's always in the $10 range and maybe threes times in this past yearI've asked) he says I always have full access to his money but I don't think he realizes that me buying groceries and diapers isn't about me buying stuff for myself. \nMeanwhile he spends money on booze and other \"extracurriculars\" and if I say anything about it I get shut down. I would honestly be ok with giving him a little if I hadn't been forced to spend all of my Christmas money on him last year as well and I didn't even get to buy something I had really wanted for a while that he said he would get me but always put it off (saying oh I forgot I'II get it for you next week, but said if every week). \nHe made me feel like I was obligated to share mine with him, so gave in and gave him $50...\nAlso I'd like to add, he already asked for $25 from me that my grandma gave me earlier in the month for Christmas and said he'd pay me back but hasn't, and he's always saying he'll give me any money back that he \"borrows\" but never does. He makes me feel so bad when I finally do ask about it again because I \"get to stay home all day with our kid while he's at work making money for us and l'm being ungrateful\" \nIt's not like I don't do anything at home either, I keep the house spotless, I never let our laundry basket get full, always do all the dishes myself, and always have to clean up his mess from the night before, all on top of taking care of our child daily. I never complain about it because I do love being a stay at home mom, but he does throw it in my face to try to make me feel bad. I really don't think I ata but I need an outside perspective. \nSo aita for not wanting to share my Christmas money with him when I haven't even been able to get anything for myself yet?", "created_utc": 1703727076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18shf0j/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_my_christmas_money/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
