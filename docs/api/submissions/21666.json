You want him to behave respectfully and supportively at your wedding because he's happy you're getting married to your high school sweetheart.\r  \n\r  \nSecond, how exactly does your father propose to prevent your brother being an AH at your wedding? If he possesses such power, why has he waited nine years to unleash it?\r  \n\r  \nDoubtless if you were to press your father on this issue, he would be forced to admit that he has no such power, that all he can do is respond to your brother's behaviour after he has already ruined your wedding.\r  \n\r  \nYour brother is not \"close family\", he's just closely related.", "NTA!\n\nGet some extra security if needed to keep him out, too.", "NTA\n\nAsk a few trusted folks to act as security for your wedding, and if your dad tries, have your security folks escort him out.\n\nYou deserve to get married without his homophobic cloud hanging over you.", "NTA, but out of spite id invite him and all 3 ex wives.", "It\u2019s your day.
