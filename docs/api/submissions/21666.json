Your dad should be fully understanding of that, & frankly he's a bit of an asshole too for trying to downplay & push it on you. Your brother showing up and \"playing nice\", as he says he can get him to, doesn't address the heart of the issue. You know how he feels and you don't need to be reminded of that on your day.

It doesn't matter if he behaves, if he's a model guest, or even if he's been to therapy recently and wanted to apologize for being a dick and tell you that he's happy you've found love on your big day- you and your wife will have a worse time if he's there.
