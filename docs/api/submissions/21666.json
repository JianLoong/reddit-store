We got along very well and we started dating a few months later. We\u2018ve been together for 9 years now and for her birthday in April, I proposed to her. I was thrilled when she said yes and we started planning our wedding.\n\nWe\u2019ve always wanted a winter wedding and our date is in January. Invitations were sent out last week and yesterday, I received an angry call from my brother (33M), asking why he hadn\u2019t received an invite.\n\nNow, my brother has never been very accepting of me being a lesbian. When I first came out, he was very certain that I was simply \"confused\" and just \"hadn\u2019t found the right man yet\".\n\nOver the years I\u2018ve been with my fianc\u00e9e, he\u2018s been constantly criticizing her and our relationship, talking about how it was doomed to fail because one day, we\u2018d realize what we were missing.\n\nI went low contact with him years ago and I only ever see him at family events but even after my proposal, the comments about our relationship didn\u2018t stop. When we announce our engagement, he literally asked if we were sure about it, because \"divorces are so stressful\". I mean, if anyone knows stuff about divorces, if must be him and his soon-to-be three ex-wives\u2026\n\nWhen he contacted me, I asked why he had expected an invitation after having absolutely no faith in our relationship for almost a decade, but he got defensive and talked about how not inviting close family to my wedding was beyond rude and that I was an AH for excluding him, my own brother, when even my cousins are invited. After all, I has been invited to all of his weddings (I only attended the first one because I liked his (now ex) wife).\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e fully supports my decision because she can\u2018t stand him, but my father called and tried to reason with me, promising he\u2018d make sure my brother behaved if I were to invite him, but I genuinely don\u2018t want him anywhere near me on our big day.", "created_utc": 1688825839, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u5fxr/aita_for_excluding_my_brother_from_my_wedding/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother isn't among them.\n\n(btw: congrats \u2665)", "NTA Why does he even *want* to come?", "Info: whose wedding is it?\n\nOh yeah. It's yours. Wich means you're the only one who can decide if you want to invite your non-supportive homophobic brother to your wedding.\n\nNTA and congrats btw! \ud83d\ude01", "NTA, the day is not about him, and you are in no way obligated to put up with his negativity just because he\u2019s family.", "YNTAH. I would just say, \u201cbased on your behavior and views in the past, I am surmising that you and I would both be more comfortable if you didn\u2019t attend. The guest list is limited, so we\u2019re only inviting those who have been very supportive to us.\u201d \nThe end. Dad doesn\u2019t get to over rule.", "NTA.  Your brother is not \"close family\" in any sense other than biology, and biology alone does not automatically score an invite.   I suspect he's worried that not being present will reflect poorly on him, but that's called reaping what he sowed.  I mean, he's a misogynistic homophobe demanding to be invited to a lesbian wedding!  No, biology does not supercede a history of bigotry and toxic behavior in a relationship that barely even exists anymore.", "NTA. Your wedding, your guest list. But aside from that, you want people who support you and make you happy. I had this issue at my wedding when family tried to invite who THEY wanted to MY wedding. I don\u2019t put up with that shit. I absolutely HATE\u2014actually LOATHE\u2014my one uncle. Never invited him and it pissed my gramma off. Oh well, don\u2019t come. I\u2019ll have fun and enjoy my day without you, and without him.", "NTA. Your wedding is a celebration of your relationship and you only want people there who support and celebrate it. I wouldn\u2019t even waste my time worrying about this. He\u2019ll get over it.", "Nta - 9 years of talking crap means you don't get an invite.", "NTA It\u2019s your decision to not have a bigot that has spent a decade belittling you, your partner and your sexuality as a whole at your wedding.  Why invite someone that you know is going to cause a scene.\n\nYour dad needs to realise that your brother spent 10 years being a homophobic d*ck so any sense of family bond has long since gone on your part, also that your fianc\u00e9e has every right to not want someone that has verbally abused her for years to not attend.  Your wedding isn\u2019t a venue/time to play happy families and only the people truly happy for you both are welcome and if he can\u2019t see that he is risking his invitation as well.", "Nta your wedding you choose guest list", "NTA it\u2019s your day and he\u2019s upset you and your fianc\u00e9 you don\u2019t get an invite. \n\nAlso, is he paying for the wedding? I presume not. Why on earth pay for an event to have people you don\u2019t like there? \n\nAlso congratulations", "NTA. He wasn't clearly happy about the 2 of you by making those comments and now he pretends to be there on your big day? You can't be sure he won't make a scene in front of all your guests", "NTA don't invite him. Stand your ground, it will be so much simpler to keep excluding him right off the bat than to invite him and then have to either rescind that invitation or get him kicked out of the wedding if he does some kind of even more deplorable behavior. The fact that your dad is saying he'll \"make him behave\" means that he knows full well that your brother's actions are wrong.", "NTA that\u2019s his problem for being nasty to u. Also he\u2019s not close if you are low contact and haven\u2019t spoken to him in years. Especially as he\u2019s made no effort with accepting your relationship or just trying to get back into contact.", "NTA at all and I'm sorry you've experienced the negative stuff you have from your brother. As a bi woman, been there. It's sad and it hurts, especially when it comes from close family.\n\nIt's a good decision to not have him there. You don't need any cloud of disproval or homophobia over your most special occassion. He doesn't deserve to be there for how he's acted and you don't deserve to be reminded of it on that day. Your dad should be fully understanding of that, & frankly he's a bit of an asshole too for trying to downplay & push it on you. Your brother showing up and \"playing nice\", as he says he can get him to, doesn't address the heart of the issue. You know how he feels and you don't need to be reminded of that on your day. Your wedding is about celebrating your union and only people who can authentically do that & be supportive of you should be there. \n\nCongratulations btw. I wish you both the best. You deserve peace, acceptance, & joy.", "NTA\n\nYour father had 9 years to control your brother and make him behave.\n\nWhy are you supposed to believe he will do it now when he spent 9 years not doing it.\n\nI guess your brother is seeing your wedding as a family event but really it's a celebration of your relationship.", "NTA", "NTA. It's your day. Not his. Good for you for standing your ground. If this is how he's behaving as a result of your decision, there's no reason to believe he'd behave accordingly at your wedding.", "NTA- I wouldn't have invited him either if it were me.", "NTA, he can spend the day talking shit from the comfort of his recliner", "Absolutely positively NTA and he should not be invited if he doesn\u2019t and never had supported your relationship!! He doesn\u2019t care to be there to see you actually get married, he only cares because he\u2019s being excluded. He has said some awful homophobic things to you over the years and should not be invited!", "NTA but why didn't your father discipline him over last 9 years?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
