You're asking them to put effort into finding something next to impossible to find - if there's even any couples they *would* want to share a close vacation with aside from this one. And if they can't find that, to pay $1,200 to the couple who canceled, on top of the $1,200 they already paid for their share of the vacation. How does that sound reasonable?\n\nAlso it's not even a verified disaster, and one that could have been avoided through multiple means!", "What I have said is that it does not take more than 5-10 minutes to send a text to a group of people that they would want to vacation with, explaining the unfortunate situation.  Though it likely they will not have takers with three days notice, they do NOT know for sure.  It is worth the try.  \n\nThen, if they can afford to pay an extra $1200 for the place to themselves, and these people are their best friends, they should consider it.  Some of the wealthiest people in the world are the stingiest.  Again, if they are wealthy and can afford to pay extra for the place to themselves, would it be worth easing their friends' burden should it turn out these good friends have gone home to a disaster?\n\nYou are possibly wrong on your last statement, and need to watch the news.  I have no idea where the poster is.  There are places in the country that have such unprecedented weather that the best of preparations could not have prevented broken pipes.  And, remember the OP said they were out-of-town.  We have no idea how long they have been there, and what was in their means.

I would also never have left for a week long vacation without having a spare key either left with friends or hidden somewhere even if it wasn't a weather heavy time of year - I always have one hidden in a safe spot regardless. Especially with close friends 5ish minutes away! So yes, if there is a disaster they had multiple ways to be responsible home owners and prevent it.", "NTA.  Why are they even asking you for the refund - the deposit was paid to the company that the wives booked the stay with.  They need to deal directly with the booking company.  If that company has a 2-week notice requirement and they are wanting to cancel 3-days before the trip, they are probably out of luck.\n\nAnd for you to find another couple to take their place in under 3-days is rather unrealistic.

If they are only 7 hours away, they could come home and check themselves before going on vacation. They may want the water company to check, but it\u2019s going to take a while for that to happen, so why would they not either hire someone privately to do a check, or get the water turned off until they come home? I feel like something else is going on and it\u2019s being used as an excuse for them not to go on the vacation (maybe they got a better offer?), and they\u2019re just trying not to lose money for cancelling.

Down the road, they may make it up to you too.", "NTA\u2026.I get why they are asking you to find a replacement family and not them.  You would want to find someone else you know and get along with. I am confused as to why others are saying they should find replacements.  What?  To send you on vacation in a shared space with people you don\u2019t know?!  But, as far as the refund, nope.  Now, if you could and wanted to, maybe you could find another couple to go with that could pay the price, but at this late date, highly unlikely.  Otherwise, this loss is on them.  But, if you are all so close, why do you not have a spare key for emergencies?  Or someone?  And am I reading g this right?  They have not even been home yet and do not even know if their pipes are frozen?  If they are unsure, they either need to leave from wherever they are at now and get home or call a locksmith to meet you at the home and get in their home.  Otherwise, once those pipes un freeze, they could be looking at some major damage and they will be looking at a much bigger loss than 1200.    Read a reply where they want the water company to check it out?  I don\u2019t think this is the water companies responsibility and they would probably not come out and to suggest a plumber or whoever is in charge of their heat.  Something is fishy here.  Again, if they are truly concerned, their butts would be on the way home now, not in a few days, because frozen/burst pipes can cause a whole lot of damage", "If you\u2019re actually really good friends and want to continue being really good friends, then ask around and see if anyone wants to take it over for them. If so, great. Give them their money back when the new couple pays up. If not, then at least you tried and showed you value the friendship. Not making any effort for close friends is AH behavior. But then again, so is demanding a non-refundable deposit back.

Right now I just think ESH as it stands.", "Tough call. NAH. You\u2019re staying in the same suite/room so it\u2019s not like they could do the normal thing of finding somebody else themselves, because they can\u2019t volunteer someone else to stay with you. If they\u2019re actually friends, trying to find someone else to go with is certainly something one would do for a friend, especially close ones like these. That being said, if you can\u2019t find anybody, it shouldn\u2019t be on you to pay more. I think the asshole differentiation here is simply an attempt at being a good friend.", "Exactly.

Are there valves in the craw space /basement to turn off individual silcocks?", "I find it fishy.   \n\n\nI understand that water department has qualified people to check on things but everyone can check the pipes if they are still in one piece and if the water is running if you turn it on.  \n\n\nIt would be faster if you could do quick check first to see if anything is wrong.  \nI kinda find fishy how they pushed all the responsibility of finding the replacement on you while demanding the 1,2k from your pocket.", "Right. I also offered to do that haha", "Yep.  I keep one literally on my porch, in case something happens to the in-ground shutoff (my house was built with the cheapest crap EVER).\n\nFrozen pipes are a major concern in Dallas (the whole country got to see flooded buildings and frozen sprays after the freeze locker we went through nearly 2 years ago).

I'm in agreement with others on here, that if you are friends, it's weird they don't want you checking things out on their behalf.\n\nBut I also find it odd they didn't arrange for someone to check on the place while they were out of town anyway.", "It's not there responsibly to find a replacement couple to go with the.its not on them", "You really should read OP\u2019s comments to this post because a lot of this is addressed.\n\n- OP is going to try and find a replacement, but is not hopeful because it\u2019s 3-day\u2019s notice during the holidays\n- A neighbor already assessed what they could from the outside, which is very little\n- Friend is only willing to accept an assessment of the situation from the water company, which is understandably very busy with this issue\n- OP asked to exchange spare keys in the past but the friend refused \n- OP is going to ask them to overnight their key\n- Friend is still out of town for three more days and can\u2019t be that concerned because he is not planning to come home early\n\nIt sounds to me like OP is doing what he can but being shot down every step of the way. And it makes no sense to me why the friend wouldn\u2019t immediately head home if they truly did think there could be an issue. There is something very odd about that fact. \n\nAll of this reads to me like the friend is looking for an excuse to cancel but doesn\u2019t want to take the financial hit.", "But can't you just find a replacement family to go on an unplanned vacation over Christmas with 2 days notice!? Lol wtf. No.", "That's a hard no. Tell them to contact the company about refunds and to keep you out of it.

Here in Michigan, it was predicted that we would've gotten hit on Friday, December 23rd.  Now I know that the news had been announcing this all week but I was busy with last minute Christmas gifts and grocery shopping.  Finally on Thursday, I thought I was done, then the news reminded me about the supposed snow storm coming the next day.  Had to jump up, go get gas for snowblower and salt for driveway/sidewalk and guess what, we didn't get hit UNTIL Christmas Day \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude23\ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\ude02.\n\nOk, all that said, when you have a vacation package that allows no refund after a certain period, this is why people should purchase travel insurance.  I believe the insurance would have paid if this couple could have proved that their house was damaged due to busted, frozen pipes as this could have been considered an emergency.", "It would be a Christmas Miracle!", "Have them hire a locksmith. Then crack up their heat, put facets on drip etc. Do they want to chance it for 3 more days that their pipes burst?", "Is this itinerary even transferable? Or is it just a hotel?", "If it were my house, I\u2019d make the 7 hour trip home ASAP. Water damage trumps everything. Seems weird they are still at their family\u2019s house.", "Honestly, they are stupid to wait 3 more days. Either get a locksmith and have you check it out or drive home. They may be panicking and have no clue but otherwise they are behaving stupidly", "Three days? They could drive home and back in 14 hours.", "NTA. I think something else is going on here. Maybe they are having financial or marital issues. Either way it\u2019s their problem and you sound like you have tried to help them with the water issue.

Who leaves their house to flood?", "Ah missed that - thanks!", "ultimately it\u2019s not their responsibility, so like if they don\u2019t find someone, it\u2019s not on them to foot the bill. but given that their close friends have a potential disaster at their home, they could at least try to invite some other friends of theirs. it\u2019s not super hard to send that text.", "Found the correct comment.", "Think I would as well BUT I wouldn't want the expectation of the cancelling couple to get a refund. What are the realistic chances of finding another couple that you want to spend time with, with no plans at this time of year, who are willing to drop $1200 on a couple days notice?", "Of course OP could, but then he would have found out the excuse is bs.", "Driving back home first is probably cheaper too. If they were that worried why didn\u2019t they cut their vacation short. If it were my house, I\u2019d have driven home already.", ">they would've turned the water to the hose off at the end of summer\n\nWe don't have those sorts of features here in the South (where it seems OP lives). Many winters, the temperature never gets below 25. Last week's 8 degrees were the coldest in decades. We simply aren't built to handle these things.", "Why were you even questioning this? They're literally just asking OP for $1200 straight up. If your friend said I really need money right now so give me $1200 or we're not friends any more, would you?", "But that\u2019s why you offer \u2014 and even offer to stick around if a locksmith is needed to get into the house to check the pipes if they didn\u2019t leave an emergency key with someone. It\u2019s cheaper to spend $150 on a locksmith than risk a burst pipe or miss out on a vacation so if they decline, it\u2019s 100% guilt free their loss.", "Exactly. Burst pipes are no joke, they should have been heading home at the first sign of that kind of trouble.", "They are being really irrational. It is insane to think you should be responsible for their half of the cost because they can't go at the last minute. It makes zero sense. You are absolutely NTA.", "Then never said a word about where they live except that it was cold, so I'm not sure where you're getting that. I live in the northeast and it was very unusually cold here too.", "It's the smart thing to do tho", "Its not clear if this is a friendship ending scenario, i was just saying it might be and some people are absolutely willing to pay to keep something as chummy as what OP describes going. im not and you probably arent but we both know there are people who totally and completely are \n\nAnd im not really the person to ask that cos im indifferent to 100% of peoples presence in my life at all period \n\nEither way OP is NTA so \u311f( \uff65\u04e9\uff65 )\u310f", "The evidence of the weather they are describing and the cold-preparedness infrastructure that doesn't exist for exactly with that conclusion.

I certainly was, when I was in another country and my friend went round to water my plants and found my keysafe missing. I had to assume someone had stolen it and taken it elsewhere to try to break it open so I started calling locksmiths to get quotes to change the locks. Got four quotes, every single locksmith was prepared to change the locks when I explained the situation, not one asked me for any kind of proof I actually lived there never mind that i owned the house. They were all prepared to change the locks and hand over the new keys to my friend who would meet them at the property. \n\nIf I were criminally inclined, that would 100% be my new business model.", "Yes a family can be 2 people LMAO and yes they should come on now.", "Less than that. See my comment above. From another country, I got a locksmith to go to my house and change the locks and give the keys to my friend when my keysafe went missing. All 4 locksmiths I phoned to quote for the job were prepared to do it and not one asked for any kind of proof it was actually my house. I was shocked. Grateful, but shocked!", "But tell them to discuss it with the company  directly  to be sure.  Nta", "Why? The other couple cancelled, why would they cover the cost of four people when there's only two of them?", "Why if they can find a replacement couple should they get to keep the money? The og couple isn't out anything either way. Why should they pocket the money?", "Agree with others. Tell them YOU don\u2019t have their $1200. The booking company does. They will have to ask them for the refund because, again, they paid that money to the booking company and NOT to you.", "NTA why is it your job to find a replacement! That\u2019s ridiculous. They knew the cancellation policy", "Can\u2019t you go check on their house? It\u2019s five minutes away? If the pipes are fine problem averted.", "NTA. They are aware of the cancelation policy and they canceled last minute. It is not on you to find the replacement family. You are not the ones taking money  so it is not your responsibility to refund or arrange refund for them canceling.", "NTA - Their cancellation is theirs to deal with, by reselling it to someone else or looking to see if they have cancellation insurance on their credit card.\n\nSucks for them, but it\u2019s on them not you. \n\nIf they are short of money because they need to fix their flooded home, they can ask for help, but they aren\u2019t just owed their half back. \n\nGood luck dealing with this tho have fun on the hills \u26f7 \ud83c\udfc2", "NTA, they are the ones that chose to drop out last minute. It's not your job to just to give them money because that really is what they are asking for in this situation.", "NTA. Kind of wondering if they need the money and are trying to find a way to justify getting it back by cancelling their end of the trip. Would they be willing to pay if OP had cancelled on them?", "NTA. Unreasonable.", "NTA. But i probably should have worded it differently. Say sorry we couldn't find anyone else so we can't refund the money. Honestly this wouldn't be reasonable end friendship though to me. If they refuse, I'd bulk up and just take the lost and wouldn't risk friendship since they are so hard to come by as we get older. I'd just never vacation with them again though", "NAH. They can ask, but it\u2019s ultimately their responsibility, not yours.", "If you still want to find a compromise, you could suggest that they consider taking less money (say $800) which may make it easier for you to find someone else you'd actually want to go on holiday with at such short notice.  Then potentially they lose $400 instead of $1200.  \n\nRegardless, it's not your responsibility to act as their insurance company.", "NTA. They can take up the issue with the travel agency, remove the idea that it's you not refunding their money.", "NTA- your friends seem awfully entitled expecting you guys to cover their issue. Not sure from what you wrote, why their not going and losing money is your problem.", "I agree. It sucks for the friends and I can totally sympathize with their concerns. And if it ends up their pipes did freeze/burst, that's going to be a lot of money so I get wanting to scramble to try to recoup money. But ultimately, that's the burden of home ownership and it's their responsibility. If it happens they can't go on the trip and no one can take their spot, it is what it is and they're going to have to eat the loss unfortunately.", "If they are legit worried about their pipes, they'll pay for a locksmith or tell you to break a window. Once they get home, if the pipes burst, the pipes burst  \n\nIf they haven't burst, you can troubleshoot thermostat or drop the faucets. If they have burst, they have a huge mess on their hands and it would be better to know now and get the ball rolling on repairs.\n\nIt's BS.", "OP lives 5 minutes away from the other couple. I don't understand why OP can't check on the house and see if flooding/freezing happened? Right now, there may be may not be a problem which may or may not prevent the other couple from coming.

When you make a financial commitment to someone, backing out is not just rude, its wrong.  To be honest your friends should not only have to find someone to replace them if they want, but they should have to okay the replacement with you.

Why should you have to refund them or find someone else too", "I would say NTA, at this point you can't get the money back from the company so they should find their own replacement", "NTA.

Weird) and they think their house is flooding in the winter but don\u2019t want to immediately leave to check it themselves?? That\u2019s incredibly fishy.

Our hose froze solid but we haven't had pipe problems. It's just that cold outside.", "Thing is, they more or less demand it. If they were like oh my, we will try to find some other couple and tell us if they're okay, then if he had loads to spend, he could say: oh don't worry, we pay, which would be extremely gracious, but they demand their money back and them to fix it, so it's an automatic no. That's a thing your own kid can say. My then 12 y o son said to me: hey you have to give dad money. He only has 20 left for the week and I had 300 or so (in minus lol). I didn't even know. Here ex, here's some money. Oh great thank you! Some friend can't say: I have 20 left, so you have to give me money. My ex will say: can I borrow some? Oh here, keep it. A friend from my son, his mother died, his dad has no cent, he wants to visit and can't pay the bus, so I offer and pay it. Else he walks an hour at night. Kid is 15 and has to have a job himself, which makes 5 an hour. The bus is 5. I'll pay that. But he doesnt just demand. Those friends are rude. And if you can pay 1200 for a trip you're rich anyway. Better give it to someone who really has no cent if you want to throw money around."]}
