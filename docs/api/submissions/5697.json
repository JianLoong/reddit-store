You're asking them to put effort into finding something next to impossible to find - if there's even any couples they *would* want to share a close vacation with aside from this one. And if they can't find that, to pay $1,200 to the couple who canceled, on top of the $1,200 they already paid for their share of the vacation. How does that sound reasonable?\n\nAlso it's not even a verified disaster, and one that could have been avoided through multiple means!", "What I have said is that it does not take more than 5-10 minutes to send a text to a group of people that they would want to vacation with, explaining the unfortunate situation.  Though it likely they will not have takers with three days notice, they do NOT know for sure.  It is worth the try.  \n\nThen, if they can afford to pay an extra $1200 for the place to themselves, and these people are their best friends, they should consider it.  Some of the wealthiest people in the world are the stingiest.  Again, if they are wealthy and can afford to pay extra for the place to themselves, would it be worth easing their friends' burden should it turn out these good friends have gone home to a disaster?\n\nYou are possibly wrong on your last statement, and need to watch the news.  I have no idea where the poster is.  There are places in the country that have such unprecedented weather that the best of preparations could not have prevented broken pipes.  And, remember the OP said they were out-of-town.  We have no idea how long they have been there, and what was in their means.  I would never blame the victim in a situation like this without knowing every detail of their supposed \"lack of preparedness.\"", "And if they truly don't have anyone else they'd want to join them? Why, again, is this their job rather than the people pulling out last second?\n\nYou're assuming they can pay double the cost based on... nothing that I can see? An extra $1200 isn't nothing to most people. If they want their money back they'll have to go to the company, not extract it from their friends.\n\nI'm in a part of the country having solidly unprecedented cold for us (it hasn't been this cold this consistently at this time of year the entire decade I've lived here), and we've known about it coming for over a week. I would also never have left for a week long vacation without having a spare key either left with friends or hidden somewhere even if it wasn't a weather heavy time of year - I always have one hidden in a safe spot regardless. Especially with close friends 5ish minutes away! So yes, if there is a disaster they had multiple ways to be responsible home owners and prevent it."]}
