You're asking them to put effort into finding something next to impossible to find - if there's even any couples they *would* want to share a close vacation with aside from this one. And if they can't find that, to pay $1,200 to the couple who canceled, on top of the $1,200 they already paid for their share of the vacation. How does that sound reasonable?\n\nAlso it's not even a verified disaster, and one that could have been avoided through multiple means!", "What I have said is that it does not take more than 5-10 minutes to send a text to a group of people that they would want to vacation with, explaining the unfortunate situation.  Though it likely they will not have takers with three days notice, they do NOT know for sure.  It is worth the try.  \n\nThen, if they can afford to pay an extra $1200 for the place to themselves, and these people are their best friends, they should consider it.  Some of the wealthiest people in the world are the stingiest.  Again, if they are wealthy and can afford to pay extra for the place to themselves, would it be worth easing their friends' burden should it turn out these good friends have gone home to a disaster?\n\nYou are possibly wrong on your last statement, and need to watch the news.  I have no idea where the poster is.  There are places in the country that have such unprecedented weather that the best of preparations could not have prevented broken pipes.  And, remember the OP said they were out-of-town.  We have no idea how long they have been there, and what was in their means.  I would never blame the victim in a situation like this without knowing every detail of their supposed \"lack of preparedness.\"", "And if they truly don't have anyone else they'd want to join them? Why, again, is this their job rather than the people pulling out last second?\n\nYou're assuming they can pay double the cost based on... nothing that I can see? An extra $1200 isn't nothing to most people. If they want their money back they'll have to go to the company, not extract it from their friends.\n\nI'm in a part of the country having solidly unprecedented cold for us (it hasn't been this cold this consistently at this time of year the entire decade I've lived here), and we've known about it coming for over a week. I would also never have left for a week long vacation without having a spare key either left with friends or hidden somewhere even if it wasn't a weather heavy time of year - I always have one hidden in a safe spot regardless. Especially with close friends 5ish minutes away! So yes, if there is a disaster they had multiple ways to be responsible home owners and prevent it.", "NTA.  Why are they even asking you for the refund - the deposit was paid to the company that the wives booked the stay with.  They need to deal directly with the booking company.  If that company has a 2-week notice requirement and they are wanting to cancel 3-days before the trip, they are probably out of luck.\n\nAnd for you to find another couple to take their place in under 3-days is rather unrealistic.  In order to save your friendship, you need to get out of the middle of this situation and let the booking company be the bad guy and tell them no.", "Nta. Don't give them a dime. They knew the policy regarding the booking well in advance. It sucks that something may have happened to their home but this is on them, not you to remedy the situation. Be prepared though, this mat be the end of the friendship. You have done nothing wrong.", "At this point, if frozen pipe couple came, the trip is ruined. Go on vacation with you\u2019re family, this friendship is over.", " NTA why would you refund them.\nSide note: have they asked you to check on the house? If you\u2019re good friends and live 5 mins away it sounds like an obvious solution. Do you have eachothers keys or know where the spare is hidden?", "NTA - This whole situation sounds fishy to me. If they are only 7 hours away, they could come home and check themselves before going on vacation. They may want the water company to check, but it\u2019s going to take a while for that to happen, so why would they not either hire someone privately to do a check, or get the water turned off until they come home? I feel like something else is going on and it\u2019s being used as an excuse for them not to go on the vacation (maybe they got a better offer?), and they\u2019re just trying not to lose money for cancelling. No matter how you look at this situation, you and your wife are NTA OP. It\u2019s not even your problem. You\u2019ve already done enough. Enjoy your vacation!", "Wasn't there any kind of trip insurance that could have been purchased?", "NTA\n\nThey cancelled their trip. That's on them. Not your responsibility. You don't owe them anything. They are delusional to think that YOU should pay them after THEY cancelled", "I probably would just kind of chuckle and say feel free to call the company and see if they'll refund your money but that's not my choice. NTA for sure.", "NTA this is why you buy travel insurance", "NTA - their demand is ridiculous. However if you wanted to play nice for the sake of the friendship you could say well try to find a replacement and if we can you will get your money back, if not no can do. Then you can decide if you really want to try to find someone or not.", "NTA They should of made sure someone had a key for emergencies or applied for trip insurance.", "INFO: You only live 5 minutes apart. Why not check on their house for them so they have assurance their house is fine?", "NTA \n\nThey have to find the substitute.\n\nAlso why can't they find a Task Rabbit or someone to go check?", "NTA, they were aware of the cancellation policy, and if they can\u2019t make it that\u2019s too bad for them.\n\nWhy should you have to take the hit for their choice?", "NTA.         \nIt's not like you went to their home and exposed their pipes to the elements.", "NTA.  \n\n\nTheir reasons are valid but why should you find a replacement family and then pay them out of your pocket? It's their money in question not yours.  \n\n\nIf the company that booked the trip has certain policy and they didn't pay for your half then you don't owe them anything and you don't have to do anything really.", "NTA. They are trying to turn their problem into your problem. They know about the 2 week cancelation policy. They know that 3 days is less than 2 weeks.\n\nAsking you to pay them $1,200 out of your own pocket is crazy. If they choose not to take the trip, it's their own choice to make, and they already know what the consequences will be.", "NTA - if they can\u2019t make it it\u2019s not your responsibility to refund them half. \n\nYou can try asking a few friends if they wanted to pay for the spaces but if they don\u2019t then that\u2019s it they\u2019ve lost their money unfortunately", "NTA. I get that they are in a bind, but if they rented it separately from you, they wouldn't be asking the rental company to find someone else. They took a risk not buying trip insurance on a nonrefundable vacation, and it's not your responsibility to figure that out.", "NTA. They'll just have to eat it. It's not up to you to find a replacement couple in 3 days. Great if there was one but really who can just drop what they're doing, call into work and take an emergency vacation in 3 days. That's how you loose your job.", "NTA.", "NTA - This is on them. Of course, if you are able to find another family to go with you, they should get the money.  \n  \nSince it's very short notice a more reasonable solution might be to offer friends the tickets for half the price and they might be able to recoup some of the money (if there are takers).", "If you aren\u2019t totally annoyed at them this point - I\u2019d be a little salty and probably say F-it but some people nicer than me - an option could be to overnight a key to you so the house can be checked.", "NTA, but you may lose the friendship over it. They\u2019re pissed that you won\u2019t refund their money and you\u2019ll be pissed if you do. No win situation. So sorry, but your friends are AHs to expect that.", "You know, legally you're fine and from a business perspective too. But out of friendship I would pay them $600 to help them out, assuming that's affordable for you. Yea it's a lot of money for nothing but they are friends and they screwed up. Offering that half compensation might go towards keeping everything kosher between you, even if you don't have to pay. Down the road, they may make it up to you too.", "NTA\u2026.I get why they are asking you to find a replacement family and not them.  You would want to find someone else you know and get along with. I am confused as to why others are saying they should find replacements.  What?  To send you on vacation in a shared space with people you don\u2019t know?!  But, as far as the refund, nope.  Now, if you could and wanted to, maybe you could find another couple to go with that could pay the price, but at this late date, highly unlikely.  Otherwise, this loss is on them.", "If you\u2019re actually really good friends and want to continue being really good friends, then ask around and see if anyone wants to take it over for them. If so, great. Give them their money back when the new couple pays up. If not, then at least you tried and showed you value the friendship. Not making any effort for close friends is AH behavior. But then again, so is demanding a non-refundable deposit back. If my friends\u2019 response to a potentially expensive emergency is \u201coh well/sucks to be you/we got the whole place to ourselves now fuck yeah\u201d instead of \u201clet me see what we can do to help,\u201d I\u2019d sure think they were AHs. Right now I just think ESH as it stands.", "Tough call. NAH. You\u2019re staying in the same suite/room so it\u2019s not like they could do the normal thing of finding somebody else themselves, because they can\u2019t volunteer someone else to stay with you. If they\u2019re actually friends, trying to find someone else to go with is certainly something one would do for a friend, especially close ones like these. That being said, if you can\u2019t find anybody, it shouldn\u2019t be on you to pay more. I think the asshole differentiation here is simply an attempt at being a good friend.", "Exactly.  It's entirely their obligation to try to recoup their money.  I fail to see how or why OP is on the hook for that.", "I agree 100% NTA.. and noone will replace them with 3 days notice. Its also not your responsibility.", "This! Their lack of planning is not an emergency for OP! I'm sorry, but this storm and cold snap was predicted and warned. It wasn't a surprise to anyone. They knew they were going to be away from their house. They should have taken the proper steps to ensure their house was ready to be left empty. If they don't want to come home to check on their own property, that's on them.\n\nNTA OP", "For some reason, he said not too, which just really confused me. He wants the water company to do it themselves", "Probably. Our wives booked it so not sure.", "My wife made that suggestion. Great idea", "This is terrible take. OP did nothing wrong in this situation.  \n\n\nBoth families OP and his friend's paid for the vacation to the company. OP offered to check the house for them but they refused.   \n\n\nIt's their responsibility to get their money back for vacation they are cancelling. OP could try to find replacement family but OP doesn't have to find replacement family or refund anything since the other family didn't paid to him they paid to the company providing the vacation.", "OP has offered to check out their home for damage, these friends are insistent they want the water department to check it out instead (and they\u2019re flooded with calls since there\u2019s tons of burst pipes).", "Nta of course but I have a question, where do you friends land on the intelligence scale?", "Too bad, so sad. They could drive home, check on the house, give a spare key to a neighbor, and drive back to where they are staying all in the same day.   \nOr they could use overnight mail to send you a key. They're just looking for an excuse to back out of the trip.  \nThey could be lying to you. But it doesn't matter either way. They missed the cancelation deadline a week and a half ago.", "If they don\u2019t want to come back because they are nearer the vacation spot, but don\u2019t want to go on vacation then the logistics are not holding up. They need to suck up the drive back to check or eat the cost of the holiday themselves rather than be lazy and push the consequences on you.", "So they have enough time to drive back, check on their house and make it to the vacation. Honestly it sounds like they're lying to you and there is another reason they don't want to go on the vacation. Don't give them anything.", "That\u2019s stupid", "I feel that since Covid, people should be always getting trip insurance.", "You actually didn't read it accurately - the other family is a 7 hour drive out from their home but a 2 hour drive from the vacation place atm but don't want to come home to check until their current vacation is done and seem to be assuming it will be a disaster when they get there. Frankly, if I thought my pipes might have burst I'd be driving home already. (But again, I would have left a key with someone I trusted so they could check!)", "They can ask the water department to turn off their water at the street.", "Really?  Why?", "It's so affordable! And such a life saver!", "I'm just curious how does that work.  Are there valves in the craw space /basement to turn off individual silcocks?", "I find it fishy.   \n\n\nI understand that water department has qualified people to check on things but everyone can check the pipes if they are still in one piece and if the water is running if you turn it on.  \n\n\nIt would be faster if you could do quick check first to see if anything is wrong.  \nI kinda find fishy how they pushed all the responsibility of finding the replacement on you while demanding the 1,2k from your pocket.", "Right. I also offered to do that haha", "Yep.  I keep one literally on my porch, in case something happens to the in-ground shutoff (my house was built with the cheapest crap EVER).\n\nFrozen pipes are a major concern in Dallas (the whole country got to see flooded buildings and frozen sprays after the freeze locker we went through nearly 2 years ago).  I you live in such an area, you\u2019d have to be insane to leave in winter and not turn off the water ahead of time\u2026.", "Yep! Code requires it here. You turn off the pipes to the outdoor spigots and drain them.", "NTA you\u2019ve already done your part.", "This!", "It's an insane thing to more or less demand. I asked my sister if her kids could go on a trip we booked instead and she said sure, cause she's really nice, they liked it and wanted to go on a trip and it was only 200 euro, but if she had said no, too bad for me. It wasn't her responsibility to help me out. These ppl treat OP like he's the travel agent. We don't go, so we don't want to pay and good luck bye. I wouldnt go on a holiday with them anymore.", "I was answering the OPs question, not judging whether the broken pipes friends should have asked for the refund in the first place.  \n\nI believe in being kind and helpful where it is possible.  The kind, helpful thing to do would be to attempt to find a replacement.  Mind you, I'm not saying spend the next 24-hours non-stop on that endeavor . . . just sending out a text to people that would be acceptable replacements.\n\nThen, beyond that, if the OP could afford the extra $1200 dollars . . . in other words he is wealthy . . . it wouldn't hurt him and he gained the benefit of having the place to himself . . . it might be worth it to help out the friends . . . again IF they were to return to a disaster at home that required  a lot of money to repair.\n\nIf the OP does not have that type of money, and he did make an attempt to find a replacement, then he is NOT obligated to return the money.\n\nIt just seems like an over-abundance of people on this post who have 0 compassion for the people potentially going home to disaster and would instead prefer to blame them for this unfortunate situation.\n\nI guess I just think that when it is within your capability to be kind, generous and helpful, you should, and being kind and helpful should always be do-able."]}
