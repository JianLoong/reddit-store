They both sent me the money and it was all set. We were all planning our outfits together with us all wanting to go as our favourite era. \n\nMy friend (20F) introduced me to Taylor as while I heard her on the radio I was never a huge fan but when 1989 came out she recommended me songs she'd thought I would like. And I did like them! She was always the Taylor Swift superfan but I like blondie too.\n\nEver since leaving high school though we've been drifting apart. We met up recently to go hang out and do some shopping. We were catching up at lunch but I started to feel like she wasn't really listening to me and only talked about herself. She's always been like that. She's only in a conversation if it's about her or her interests.\n\nSo, another important thing about me is I've always been insecure about my weight. My friend knows this. While we were shopping for clothes I picked out a really pretty dress and said I liked it. She just kind of stared at me and said it wouldn't look good on me. I couldn't really picture myself in it. I went and looked around the rest of the shop.\n\nI didn't buy anything but my friend decided to buy something: that same dress. It really annoyed me. She's always been thinner than me and made a point to talk about people complimenting her on her amazing body.\nWe had been in a couple shops by this point she wanted to go home but I hadn't found anything. I was looking for a dress to wear out clubbing.\n\nWe went into another shop and I found something but again she said it didn't look right when she saw me try it on. At this point I was sick of her saying this stuff so I asked what she meant.\n\nShe said it just didn't look right. I asked her again. She said it made my legs look weird. \"How?\" I asked. She went:\n\"It just doesn't fit you! I can see all your rolls! God!\" \n\nI was really hurt. That was the exact reason I hate wearing anything tight. I just shouted:\n\"Well, it wouldn't look good on you either, mate!\"\n\nI left the shop and went home. I had a coworker who really wanted to see Taylor as well so I asked her to send me the money and the ticket would be hers. She's never been that quick, not even at work. I sent my friend the money back and then before I could even text her she called me.\n\nShe was asking me why she'd done that and I told her I wouldn't go to the concert with her and I didn't want to be froends with her anymore. She shouted at me, calling me names but I just hung up. I'm not budging.\nAll our friends are blowing up my phone saying I'm being unfair and to give her back her ticket. She keeps trying to call me.\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE: (I put this in comments but got downvoted to hell)\n I've been keeping an eye on the thread and everyone agrees I'm the asshole. Thanks for responding. I've giving my ticket to my (ex) friend. Then I'm going to avoid her because she's only ever made me feel bad about myself especially with the comments she has made about my body. \nI've told my coworker as per comments advice. She can go to the concert and I hope she enjoys it. It's standing so she doesn't have to hang out with them and she doesn't want to as she thinks my friend's the a.\nI think I'll just go out clubbing in another dress that I genuinely like.

You sold tickets that weren\u2019t yours to sell as your friend had already paid for them. They are high demand tickets that she won\u2019t be able to buy again without spending a fortune. You should tell your coworker that there was a misunderstanding and refund her money or give YOUR ticket to the coworker and not go yourself. \n\nAs for her comment, it wasn\u2019t nice. But it seemed like you kept asking what she thought and she tried not to tell you the truth but you kept pressing until she finally told you that it didn\u2019t look good. It sucks to hear that it you basically wouldn\u2019t accept her answer. I say this as a plus size person-you probably already knew her reason and should have just dropped it. Why force her to say the words that already know?", "Assuming it is really hard to get tickets, YTA for selling her ticket without first having a proper discussion about ending your friendship and then figuring out what to do about the concert.\n\nIt's fine if your friendship has run its course and ending the friendship if you feel she is not a good friend for you right now.

You need to undo what you have done or give up YOUR ticket. \n\nI am not saying that your (former) friend is an innocent here- she sounds a bit self-absorbed and certainly could be a lot more tactful but you went nuclear.

Body shaming coming from a friend sucks even more. What you did as retaliation was way more severe.

You could have just sent her the ticket along with a note saying you didn't want to go with her, but instead you sold it knowing that she did want to go, so that just comes across as really spiteful and immature.

It\u2019s a whole other thing to say it looks bad bc \u201cI can see your rolls\u201d.

I'm just sick of these comments saying a fat person should just put up with their thinner friends attitudes about their bodies.\nI'm not going to argue anymore with you because I don't think you can really see my point of view on that. Thanks for acknowledging she was shitty too.", "Thank you and no worries. Sorry if I came off as rude in my reply. The comments about how I should have just put up with her opinions are rlly getting to me. Thanks for being so kind.", "We all fuck up. And dealing with friends who turn out to not be great friends after all is hard. You absolutely messed up here, but good on you for seeing that and taking steps to make it right. That\u2019s an important thing to learn to do. I hope you find some new friends who make you feel good about yourself and have a great time going out.", "> She was visibly disgusted with me in it. She was always looking down on me in any clothes I wore whether I liked them or not.\n\nYou need therapy. She was being a friend by using flowery terms, your own insecurity is making you see and made you presume things. In the end yes, if you are on the heavy fluffy side some things will not look nice at all.", "You didn't come off as rude, don't even worry about that.  You're good.  And you should never have to put up with someone saying those things to you.  You have the right to be angry.  I certainly would be!", "Thank you. I think I'm giving up reading this whole post thread, might even delete as all the genuinely helpful responses are gone and it's just people telling me I asked for her opinions. I've done my best to make amends outside the post so hopefully it will sort itself out irl."]}
