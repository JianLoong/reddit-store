The problem with getting it more than once is that repeated infections make each time more likely to turn into hemorrhagic fever, which is extremely dangerous. Dengue fever has a thing where already having antibodies against one serotype of the virus protects you from getting that serotype again, but if you get a different serotype, the antibodies won't neutralize it, and will bind to the virus and help it get into cells so they replicate more. So the risk of severe dengue is higher. I mean, you can still have hemorrhagic dengue fever the first time around, but repeated infections are riskier.

Your aunt needs an attitude and reality adjustment.", "I think there is a time to withhold details. My first child\u2019s birth was a nightmare that ended in a life flight and month long NICU stay. I do not share the details with expectant moms. \n\nBut there\u2019s a difference between withholding details and lying. The aunt lied. OP kept the gory details to himself while being truthful, which I think is the perfect way to handle it. \u201cIt can be rough: staying hydrated helps\u201d is a great way to prepare someone, be helpful, and not scare them. \n\n(So basically, you and I agree on the judgement, but ironically, I\u2019m quibbling over the details.)", "saying it's a cakewalk could leave him feeling ashamed or scared if he finds it painful and thinks that is abnormal", "Yeah I don\u2019t lie like that to my kids. Not intentionally anyway. I told my daughter her finger prick for cholesterol would be quick and almost painless and then they had to fill this whole tube with blood. It was awful, poor thing. But I didn\u2019t know it would be that way. \n\nI will say things like, \u201cShots hurt for just a second but then the pain goes away. That\u2019s a lot better than being really sick for a week.\u201d So I will try to reframe it, but I don\u2019t lie.", "Lying to kids just makes them mistrust doctors and parents.\nBetter to make a plan.\n\n\"Squeeze my hand and look at me.\"", "yup! I definitely think OP needs to tell their aunt that they should be more concerned over the fact dengue is a deadly disease, and maiming others who don't die, about 5% of cases turn to severe dengue which is even worse than what OP describes. \n\nit would helpbher emotionally prepare.", "\u2665\ufe0f", "Guy who doesn't know how the immune system works. Neither getting an infection of getting a vaccine garuntees you won't get it, it makes it easier for your body to fight the infection through Memory T cells. Memory T Cells essentially just store a protien that debilitates and marks that infection for destruction. The proccess is the same through infection and vaccines, except vaccines are tailor made to maximise Memory T Cells and minimize damage to the body.", "I don't think anyone argued that getting immunity from the infection wasn't a thing, just that there were better ways of developing immunity.", "also why they can't create an effective vaccine, if you took a vaccine for one type then got infected with a second it would make severe dengue more likely. that said one infection can also kill if you are unlucky. there is a reason countries have been trying yo stop it.n \n\ni did think the issue with the different types was also because it makes a cytokine storm really likely.", "And doctors lie their faces off. \u201cYou\u2019re going to feel some pressure.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s your code word for \u201cit\u2019s going to hurt like a mother\u201d.", "Agreed. I'm an adult with an average pain tolerance and a chronic pain issue. I expect to be told when something is expected to be painful or uncomfortable (besides obvious ones like the prick of a needle during an injection, which kids may not instinctively know yet). \n\nIf I'm not informed, I report any pain and express any discomfort/pressure I feel, during. You never know when you're experiencing warning signs of passing out or the nurse has struck a nerve or the fever has become lethal or any other of a thousand problems.\n\nAny kid I have, I would expect them to communicate unexpected pains & discomforts that they can't explain given what they know. This is the relationship that adults and kids alike should have between themselves and pain.", "I'm with you: If I expect to feel nothing and I feel something, I'm going to be concerned that something has gone wrong \u2013 and I've had a couple of minor procedures done with only local anesthetic even though they recommended sedation, and am pretty good with pain.", "I remember the first time my pediatrician had to give me a shot; I was clearly nervous, and he asked me if I could count to 10. I was in preschool, and very proudly told him that I could. So he told me to count to 10, and I did. I was so focused on counting that I didn't even realize he'd given me the shot. I've never *liked* getting shots, of course, but I never feared them after that.", "There is a video of a doctor on the internet who makes little songs and places the needle with the cap all over the body of the little children and when they are listening to the doctor he takes of the cap and injects them without them realising it and because they are listening to him and watching him don\u2019t even feel the pain of the needle. I always love this video. Will probably only work on really small children. \n\nAnd yes, squeezing hands is something good to do with the older children. We always got a popsickle afterwards. So we were like \u201cget the needle in quickly and we\u2019ll be on our way!\u201d we still felt it but it was nice to get something as a reward.", "i bet Russia  deported him for sloppy work", "Or \"you'll only feel a pinch!\" And then proceed to feel like someone literally stabbed you with the dullest knife around.", "We call it the Texas bee sting.", "I have a College age needlephobe, and when we went for the COVID vaccine, I *still* bribed her with ice cream. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nWe are never too old for treats after we do something brave.", "My old obgyn told me that my biopsy would be just a pinch.
