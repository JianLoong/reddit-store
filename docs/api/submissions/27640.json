To be asked to lie is wrong.", "Hmmm. I never, ever want to lie to anyone, ever, but I am not sure how I would have responded, either, OP. Having experienced Dengue just once...oml...that was no joke. I am not, nor have I ever been, religious, but in the worst throes I had horrific fever dreams where I (allegedly) cried and begged for \"God or whoever you are to please, make this go away...forever!\", and then melted into repeated fits of tears. Yet, like you, I survived (though 3x is crazy bruh, and potentially more deadly each time? Or is that a myth?)\n\nAll that said...I would of course, want to provide a ton of support and encouragement to any of my loved ones who were experiencing the same illness or something similar to what I experienced. And if that meant temporarily downplaying how rough it might have been at the outset, (and in hopes of providing hope for many amazing years ahead like I've honestly had)...then yep, I would totally be cautious on how much information of pain or discomfort (or outright terror, lol) that I would share.", "NTA. I take it your aunt has never had it. And why is she lying to her son? It is not a cakewalk at all. His doctor can help him through this with answers to questions.

They were young adults in their early 20s.\n\nMy nephew got hospitalized but was there around 3 days. He was in a lot of pain. Fever. No transfusion. Bunch of meds. He was 10.\n\nIt killed my brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Her case was more odd, not much fever, on and off. Pain came in spikes. Apparently, it was an unusual strain and they tested for it too late. Symptoms didn\u2019t really add up. It wrecked her organs and she went down fast. Late 20s.", "NTA\n\nNo need to lie to your cousin.

My sons girlfriend got dengue in Bali, very painful, very sick, lost sight in parts of her eyes, got some back but left with scarring. It\u2019s no cakewalk and he should know what to expect. She had to get a transfusion and spent time in hospital so not much of a holiday after all that.", "NTA and fudge no. Only had it once and it was the most painful time of my life. I wish it on nobody. Wrecked me for a couple weeks after. I wish I had known what it was early on. I'd be honest and tell him it DOES get better, take your meds and yes, do drink lots of water and broths. I could hardly eat and got pretty weak. \n\nIf it's so prevalent in your area he better be prepared, emotionally at least. \n\nYou had it three times? It's my biggest fear as it can become worse the most times you get it (different strains). Currently in a dengue area and am lathered up in different anti mozzie things, DEET 50 and more.", "NTA\n\nTelling lies like that helps nobody - it gives you a brief period of him thinking it is going to be okay before it hits him like a truck and he loses any trust he had in you.\n\nInstead you can be a bit more realistic, but try and put a positive spin on it - it did suck, but you got through it okay, and so will he.\n\nThe trick is in finding the line where you are telling the truth, but perhaps not being quite so blunt about the negatives.", "Absolutely not. He'd have likely felt shame for not finding it easily manageable. \n\n  I used to get told I was dramatic as from the age of 11 I would have excruciating period cramps. I would literally end up in a ball on the floor barely able to catch a breath. My 3 sisters didn't get bad cramps so I was obviously being overly dramatic/faking. \n\n  Turns out I have endometriosis. Undiagnosed for many years as noone believed me.\n\n  It's not quite the same, but even now I get told by my sister 'it can't be that bad' it makes me question it myself and so I tend to push through pain.\n  You're absolutely right not to lie.

There's a reason it's also nicknamed \"bonebreak fever\".\n\nAlso, you may want to look into the vaccine to see if it will protect you against a fourth infection.

(check with a doctor for your specific situation ofc)\n\n\nThe vaccine is really only bad if you've never had it at all, and it is possible to test to see if you've had it before getting the vaccine if you aren't sure.", "It's because medical researchers have analyzed the survival odds, and found that someone who gets an infection despite being vaccinated is going to be more likely to die than someone who never had any strains and wasn't vaccinated.", "NTA. I had a pretty mild case of dengue and it was still pretty brutal", "No definitely not. He needs to know the truth.  \nNTA", "NTA. Your aunt is not thinking this through. If you say it's a cakewalk and cousin has just as bad a time with it as you actually did, what's he going to think? At 10, it will probably make him super anxious to think his experience is worse than normal, and maybe he will even be disoriented enough to think he's dying or something extreme like that. In the circumstances, telling him that lie can actually cause harm for no good reason.\n\nETA- this might not be the case at all, but... is there any reason to believe auntie might want you to say it was easy so she can shame cousin into not complaining about his symptoms? If you're from somewhere that toxic masculinity is the norm, I'd be worried that child will be in pain and crying for his mommy and being told to \"man up\" because \"it's not that bad\" and that you \"never made such a fuss\".

In terms of averages, you're both right -- the first time does tend to be a mild infection, but after that, you're more vulnerable to have the type that gave it its popular name, breakbone fever.

Got to Gatwick, passed spark out in the security queue, woke up in hospital with tubes all over and a doctor telling him if he\u2019d waited another hour then they could not have helped him. He nearly died and was in hospital for weeks. He was so weak he couldn\u2019t walk after.

It'll make him feel bad for actually feeling pain and worry more thinking it's a worse version or the doctors are lying.\n\nWhat you can say, is that it's something big men have to deal with, even super heroes! And if you eat healthy foods it might not happen again.", "NTA - you gave your cousin the advice you thought he needed and did not lie to him. If you DID lie to him and told him it was a cakewalk, and then it turned out it wasn't you would be TA.", "I had dengue fever when I was in college. I would say I was very tired. But that was mostly it. It's not good though to say something would be easy as each person would react to the virus in different ways. No one can say it would be hard or easy.

The worst thing is when you aren't prepared or have a wildly different expectation from reality and then... it hits you. People should prepare, get in the mindset of of what's to come.

My mother always tell the parents not to say something like that because it will be painful a bit and then they don\u2019t trust their parents anymore on this topic.

I ended up missing almost two months of university classes until I was good enough to return... \n\nAnd both my granmother and uncle were seriously sick a full week when they caught it. Dengue is NOT a cakewalk.", "The seriousness is not related to the level of pain, exactly. You can get it once and it be really painful but not life-threatening. The problem with getting it more than once is that repeated infections make each time more likely to turn into hemorrhagic fever, which is extremely dangerous. Dengue fever has a thing where already having antibodies against one serotype of the virus protects you from getting that serotype again, but if you get a different serotype, the antibodies won't neutralize it, and will bind to the virus and help it get into cells so they replicate more. So the risk of severe dengue is higher. I mean, you can still have hemorrhagic dengue fever the first time around, but repeated infections are riskier. That's why they monitor platelets levels when you get it", "I'm an adult. I have a fairly high pain tolerance.
