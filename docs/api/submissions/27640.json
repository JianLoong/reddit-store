I'm sure your aunt was more looking for you to say something to not scare him, which is fine, but you can not scare him while also not pretending that dengue is a joke.

I wouldn't want that possibility.\n\nI'd tell him that it might be a cakewalk for some, since that's the truth. If he asks further, you can tell him that you had a difficult time, but that it's unlikely that he will. Keep it neutral. Don't scare him or else that place effect will go the opposite way with the stress from fear.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To be asked to lie is wrong.", "Hmmm. I never, ever want to lie to anyone, ever, but I am not sure how I would have responded, either, OP. Having experienced Dengue just once...oml...that was no joke. I am not, nor have I ever been, religious, but in the worst throes I had horrific fever dreams where I (allegedly) cried and begged for \"God or whoever you are to please, make this go away...forever!\", and then melted into repeated fits of tears. Yet, like you, I survived (though 3x is crazy bruh, and potentially more deadly each time? Or is that a myth?)\n\nAll that said...I would of course, want to provide a ton of support and encouragement to any of my loved ones who were experiencing the same illness or something similar to what I experienced. And if that meant temporarily downplaying how rough it might have been at the outset, (and in hopes of providing hope for many amazing years ahead like I've honestly had)...then yep, I would totally be cautious on how much information of pain or discomfort (or outright terror, lol) that I would share.", "NTA. I take it your aunt has never had it. And why is she lying to her son? It is not a cakewalk at all. His doctor can help him through this with answers to questions. It is good that you didn't tell him what might have been a huge lie.\n\nI am stuck on what is wrong with your aunt?", "NTA.

I\u2019d ask your aunt what the objective is.\n\nI had dengue pretty recently. They don\u2019t call it breakbone fever for nothing. It hurt like all (&;$ but I was well enough to be at the office almost the whole time. Low grade fever once in a while but lots of pain. They discovered it when it was on its way out. I was mid 40s. \n\nIt downed my brother and sister for a week or so, they were hospitalized and had transfusions. High fever. They were mostly asleep when I visited. They were young adults in their early 20s.\n\nMy nephew got hospitalized but was there around 3 days. He was in a lot of pain. Fever. No transfusion. Bunch of meds. He was 10.\n\nIt killed my brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Her case was more odd, not much fever, on and off. Pain came in spikes. Apparently, it was an unusual strain and they tested for it too late. Symptoms didn\u2019t really add up. It wrecked her organs and she went down fast. Late 20s.", "NTA\n\nNo need to lie to your cousin. Otherwise it can influence his behaviour to go to a doctor.", "NTA something known as breakbone fever can't be pleasant.", "NTA\n\n\"I'm not gonna lie to you. You're gonna have a really bad couple of days (or however long), there's no way around that. But you'll come out of it just fine. I've had it three times and I'm no worse for the wear. If I can do it, so can you!\"", "That would be lie, so why do you have to lie because your aunt wants you to. My sons girlfriend got dengue in Bali, very painful, very sick, lost sight in parts of her eyes, got some back but left with scarring. It\u2019s no cakewalk and he should know what to expect. She had to get a transfusion and spent time in hospital so not much of a holiday after all that.", "NTA and fudge no. Only had it once and it was the most painful time of my life. I wish it on nobody. Wrecked me for a couple weeks after. I wish I had known what it was early on. I'd be honest and tell him it DOES get better, take your meds and yes, do drink lots of water and broths. I could hardly eat and got pretty weak. \n\nIf it's so prevalent in your area he better be prepared, emotionally at least. \n\nYou had it three times? It's my biggest fear as it can become worse the most times you get it (different strains). Currently in a dengue area and am lathered up in different anti mozzie things, DEET 50 and more.", "NTA\n\nTelling lies like that helps nobody - it gives you a brief period of him thinking it is going to be okay before it hits him like a truck and he loses any trust he had in you.\n\nInstead you can be a bit more realistic, but try and put a positive spin on it - it did suck, but you got through it okay, and so will he.\n\nThe trick is in finding the line where you are telling the truth, but perhaps not being quite so blunt about the negatives.", "Absolutely not. He'd have likely felt shame for not finding it easily manageable. \n\n  I used to get told I was dramatic as from the age of 11 I would have excruciating period cramps. I would literally end up in a ball on the floor barely able to catch a breath. My 3 sisters didn't get bad cramps so I was obviously being overly dramatic/faking. \n\n  Turns out I have endometriosis. Undiagnosed for many years as noone believed me.\n\n  It's not quite the same, but even now I get told by my sister 'it can't be that bad' it makes me question it myself and so I tend to push through pain.\n  You're absolutely right not to lie. NTA", "NTA\n\nKids need the truth. \n\nOld name for dengue was 'breakbone fever' because it was so painful.\n\nTell the kid its painful, that way he will be prepared. If he has a light case, he'll be happy he had an easier time than you did.", "NTA.  There's a reason it's also nicknamed \"bonebreak fever\".\n\nAlso, you may want to look into the vaccine to see if it will protect you against a fourth infection.  Each one is supposed to be worse and more-likely-fatal than the previous.  Kinda surprised you survived #3 since I've read that's usually fatal.", "\"it's going to suck. You'll think your dying for a whilr- but you'll survive. Your going to be fine as long as you listen to your doctor's\"\n\nDoesn't sugar coat, but helps reassure", "> They appear to be effective against all three types.\n\nThere's four.  He's never going to get the three he already had again.  Infection-acquired immunity is a real thing, despite the last three years of intensive bullshit propaganda.\n\nThe vaccine is usually recommended for people who have had one or two strains, because subsequent dengue infections are often fatal -- it gets worse every time.  However, I don't know how the vaccine would affect OP since he's already had three of the four.", "Usually the first time is asymptomatic but my parents said I had symptoms from my first time when I was a kid. I know the chance of my cousin going through painful symptoms from his first case is low but since it happened to me I just don't want to risk telling him it's easy and having his case be otherwise.", "The flip side is once you\u2019ve had it, you can get vaccinated against future infection. Don\u2019t ask me why; I don\u2019t really understand it either.", "You can get it badly the first time, but the odds of a severe infection go up each time you get the infection.", "Not necessarily, I knew someone who got it and he ended up in hospital for a week.", "Getting the vaccine is almost certainly better than just waiting to get the 4th strain, especially since OP probably lives somewhere where it's endemic. (check with a doctor for your specific situation ofc)\n\n\nThe vaccine is really only bad if you've never had it at all, and it is possible to test to see if you've had it before getting the vaccine if you aren't sure.", "It's because medical researchers have analyzed the survival odds, and found that someone who gets an infection despite being vaccinated is going to be more likely to die than someone who never had any strains and wasn't vaccinated."]}
