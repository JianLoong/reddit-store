I love both dearly but John is a bit difficult to be around. He still acts like a child and is incredibly mean to his younger brother. I\u2019m putting it lightly actually, he\u2019s terrible to Finn. My sister doesn\u2019t say anything because he has autism but will instead spoil Finn to make up for the bullying. It\u2019s a really weird situation that I didn\u2019t pick up on until very recently after I moved closer to them.\n\nMy sister, brother in law and nephews came over for dinner the other day. It was going well when all of a sudden my daughter (18) told me she couldn\u2019t find her very expensive necklace. I had assumed she had misplaced it and assured her I\u2019d help her find it later but then I noticed that Finn looked extremely nervous. I took him aside and asked him if he was alright. He ended up admitting that he stole her necklace. \n\nHe bursted into tears saying that he was really sorry, he didn\u2019t want to, and John made him do it. He was bordering a panic attack. I called my sister over and told her what happened. \n\nI then asked her what she was going to do about this. She said \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? I can\u2019t control them and they\u2019re old enough to figure things out on their own.\u201d\n\nSo I said: \u201cso you\u2019re completely fine with John bullying Finn? It doesn\u2019t bother you at all?\u201d\n\nShe said that it does bother me. So I asked why she doesn\u2019t do anything about it then. I straight up told her that I don\u2019t want to hear any of her bullshit excuses. She asked me what I meant by that. So I told her, your excuses are pathetic. John has autism, boys will be boys, I\u2019m scared, Finn needs to learn to stand up for himself, etc etc. I told her that these are all bullshit and that she\u2019s setting both kids up for failure. \n\nShe started bawling and called me a heartless judgement bitch who won\u2019t understand. She then left, leaving her husband and kids. I told her husband what happened and he just sighed. My mom then called me later saying that I should be kinder to my sister. I told her I was just telling the truth. My mom then said that I\u2019m acting like one of those annoying \u201cI was only being honest\u201d assholes.

Ask her how she'll feel when Finn no longer talks to her because she's never done anything to stop the bullying.", "NTA. I had to check John's age twice. He's 25! He's an adult. Autism isn't an excuse for bullying even if he were a kid. Honestly. ask Finn if the day he turns 16 he wants to move into your home and be part of yoru family and get away from an older brother who torments him and a mother who doesn't care to help him.  I feel sorry for your sister, who if she says she's \"afraid\" is likely also getting bullied by John, but she is an adult: she needs to figure this out herself. Finn's the one who needs rescuing.", "NTA but you should have kicked the boys out and offered to help Finn escape his brother if he agrees to turn his life around.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s setting them up for failure, I think she already did that. She needs to protect Finn better, and it\u2019s not a good excuse that John has autism, because bullying is not indicative of being autistic.", "NTA and you, unfortunately, are right. She's definitely setting them up to fail in life.", "NTA she has already failed her children.", "NTA - Even if John has autism, that doesn't stop him from being a decent human being and your sister should be punishing him for this, not rewarding him for this horrible behavior. As much as a parent should love their child no matter, they should also be teaching them to be a good citizen. She should also be doing more to protect Finn from this.  \nI wouldn't say she's setting him up for complete failure but he's definitely gonna realise that his actions have consequences", "NTA \nYour right, by allowing this she\u2019s letting John know whatever he does is okay and he will suffer no consequences. She\u2019s ignoring Finn and what he\u2019s feeling practically bribing him with whatever he wants so she doesn\u2019t have to feel guilty that John treats him like trash.

Hell yeah! Will the person in the wrong act like a victim of it hurts their feelings? Yep LOL.", "NTA. Truth hurts, especially when they don't want to hear it and are in denial. Both of those parents are failing those kids. Autism is not an excuse to be an abusive dick.", "NTA.\n\nYou're 100% correct.  Your sister is setting her sons up for failure, especially John.  Having autism is no excuse for John's bullying or bad behavior.  Many autistic people can learn better behavior.  \n\nYour sister is allowing her 15 year old son to be bullied by his much older brother.  At 15, he still needs support to stand up to his brother - Finn is not old enough to figure this out.  This isn't a \"boys will be boys\" issue (which is a BS excuse in my book) but a serious parenting failure.  Finn is likely to go NC with his parents as soon as he's out of the house.  I can't imagine how he feels.\n\nAlso, John should be able to understand that stealing anything is wrong, and it's not a prank to steal.  One day he's going to take it too far, and your sister won't be able to intervene.\n\nKeep the lines of communication open with Finn.  He's going to need support.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is setting them up for failure. But she's not gonna do shit even if you yell at her.", "NTA.

I would just not have them over to my house if they're going to have drama and steal my child's stuff if I were you.", "I'm sorry but aren't you a little concerned that one of your sisters excuses is that she's scared... am I the only one who is concerned by this. \n\nNta, but next time just kick John out. He's 25, he is supposed to ne the one you have an adult conversation with.", "NTA - I\u2019m 53, autistic, and I was the bullied child.  Mom needs to get her sons into therapy, John onto medication, and start practicing tough love.  All you did was hit an exposed nerve, and Mom is covering up for her.  Perhaps you could have been a tad more delicate in your comments, but it needed to be said.\n\nBoth kids can still have good lives, if parents act.", "Tell your mom that you are only treating your sister there same way John treats his brother which is apparently acceptable.", "NTA. \n\nI can't really speak on John as autism is a spectrum. A lot of people only consider high functioning types but there is a lot more than that. From the info given we don't really know John's capabilities. \n\nSpoiling Finn though. I'm assuming he's neurotypical? He needs to learn responsibility. \n\nI get why you did what you did but I imagine you sister has a lot to deal with with John. Especially if he's going to be with her for life. You aren't obligated to but it would be a good gesture if you spent time with Finn just by himself. John likely dominates his parents attention and he is pushed around by John so a lot of his acting up is because of this dynamic. Even if he's superficially spoiled.", "ESH (except Finn even though he stole) \n\nFor you it's only a slight 'AH' because you are absolutely correct, and it's time that somebody told her the truth, but there might have been a kinder way to do it.  People get defensive and turn their hearing off once they feel threatened.  This proved true because your Sister is refusing to take in what you said and even got your mom involved.\n\nBut GOOD for you for stepping up and saying something. \n\nIt seems obvious that family needs outside help. Both those boys need to be in therapy as well as the whole family being in family therapy.  It's horrible that Finn is being treated that way, that poor kid has got to be so anxious 24/7.  Your sister sounds overwhelmed and 'doing her best' but you're correct: that kind of 'ignore the real problem' behavior makes everything worse for everybody.\n\nAlso your sister & BIL need to start thinking about Johns future - there will be no way in hell Finn's going to 'take care of' John.  He shouldn't.  It's doubtful he'd ever want any contact with him again once he's out of the house.\n\nAt 25 it may be time John moves into a group home, it may be frustrating for him being home and being treated like a 'kid' often times folks do better in group homes because it's not 'family' ie no old family dynamics like babying/bullying.", "Edit: Changed to NTA. I get why this was a sudden realization now. It\u2019s a lot easier to hide disfunction when they didn\u2019t live near you. You\u2019re trying to course correct years of enabling John, which is difficult to do. A harsh wake up call was needed, your mom can pound sand.\n\n\nOriginal: ESH. John is old enough to land himself in some serious consequences in the real world regardless of his disability. However, none of this truly dawned on you until your child was affected. Like come on\u2026be real, you\u2019ve watched this happen for 25 years and said nothing. Little late to Monday Morning Quarterback now.", "ESH\n\nJohn is 25, your intervention at this late date is largely unhelpful and just pointing out a compounded problem your sister is already aware of.", "Are you asking us if we condemn her parenting style? Obviously yes. It's a bit unfair to ask us to say \"my sister is a shitty mom and I confronted her about that, which one of us is the asshole?\" because it minimizes the actual confrontation. We have no idea if you're a perfect parent either. All I can judge is that you went from zero to 100 on your sister for something she technically didn't do. It sounds like you have a history of trying to speak to her about it and seeing your daughter hurt caused anger in you towards her for not preventing that pain in someone you love. Which is totally understandable. Starting a conversation with diminishing her by calling her POV bullshit and pathetic was bad faith engagement. You just wanted to make her feel bad. Period.\n\nI'm going to go ESH/NAH because she's not the children's only parent, she's just the one you feel it's OK to yell at. I think you both need to a heartfelt discussion on how you're both hurting. Clearly she is struggling somewhere. She's lacking some sort of love for herself so she's been incapable of passing that down to her own kids. Is she the older sister by chance? They often get way more traumatized while growing up for various reasons. You vented a lot of anger on her all at once and it needed to be handled a lot more delicately.
