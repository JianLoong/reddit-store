Let's call him Ted. My youngest uncle on my Dad's side and his wife are very close to our family. They have 2 children Harry (M6), Millie (F3).\n\nAccording to my aunt, my cousins are the next best things since sliced bread. \n\nHowever, my aunt has this habit of trying to put down other kids, make them look bad in order to make it seem like Harry and Millie shine brighter than the sun. She has done the same with Ted.\n\nFor eg. when Ted turned 8 in Jan, he wanted to have chocolate cake on his birthday. When my aunt find out, she called me and said, He should have a vanilla with a raspberry filling as Millie does not prefer chocolate. \n\nWe offered to bring a small slice of cake of Millie's choice separately, but that suggestion was rejected by my aunt.\n\nShe claims that for the last 4 of his birthday's Millie did not get to Ted's birthday cake (we didn't celebrate for 3 years due to covid regulations. \n\nSo this year we should celebrate with a cake of Millie's choice, so that she can enjoy a \"birthday cake\" and not just \"some cake\" and feel left out. \n\nOn Ted's birthday, she made a huge fuss about how rude, stubborn and rigid Ted is. He doesn't know how to respect his elders. How he could not accommodate a simple request,  when she saw the chocolate cake.\n\nTed was very upset.\n\nAll this happened in front of my parents. I requested my dad to ask her, or at least speak to her brother to ask her to back off, but they were mute spectators. \n\nThey said, they cannot do anything about this since his brother is family.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, we were gathered at our parents' place for Easter Brunch. Ted was having his food. He is allergic to peanuts. \n\nThe dipping sauce that my mum had made contained peanuts. She had forewarned me and Ted about the sauce.\n\nMy aunt was well aware of the allergy, but she was going around with the sauce serving it to the children.\n\nWhen Ted refused the sauce, she went off on him.\n\nSaying things like, he is being rude, rigid and disrespectful to her. Ted started to cry.\n\nMe along with my husband and others came to the backyard, hearing the commotion.\n\nThe first time in life, my husband firmly told my aunt to step away and back off from Ted. \n\nMy uncle saw this and he was upset saying that this is not the way to talk to your elders, and that my aunt was just trying to teach him manners.\n\nI said, that they should just leave us alone, and let us decide about to raise our child.\n\nBut that too did not go down well with him, and he said, that no wonder Ted his as mannerless. His mother doesn't have manners, how can he expect Ted to have any?? When my husband tried to speak to him, he told him \"I will slap your face if you don't shut up right now\"\n\nAs usual my parents did not utter a word. \n\nWe just picked up our things and left\n\nThen our phone was swamped up with messages that we should NOT have spoilt the Easter party. \n\nAita???", "created_utc": 1681721011, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12p8g23/aita_for_standing_up_to_my_uncle_and_aunt_for_my/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
