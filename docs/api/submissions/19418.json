I can see it now, she adopts one from a shelter to brag on social media \"hashtag adopt don't shop\" and then 3 weeks later she returns it for behavioral issues after chasing it around, forcing hugs on it, and generally ignoring its \"I'm uncomfortable\" body language until it bites her out of self defense.", "Well the winery is dog friendly, so I'm able to bring him. It's a pretty place to stroll and gives him new places to sniff. And he just likes to spend time with us and this is where we like to go if we want to spend an evening out of the house.", "I'm sure there are plenty of dogs out there that love getting pets from strangers.

I would never represent my dog as a service dog. I don't believe that's right.
