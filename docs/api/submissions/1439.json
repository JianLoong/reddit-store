You have discovered how most people feel about their jobs. You are not an AH for feeling that way. Your parents are not AHs for wanting you to earn miney for college, and learn to handle a job.  \n\n\nFind a new job FIRST. That's what adults have to do. Then ask your parents if you can change jobs.", "NTA, but line up a new job first, to show them you're not just being \"lazy.\" Maybe a part time position at the local animal shelter? What are YOU interested in, career-wise? Apply to places that can give you experience in those areas. (IMO, 15 is a bit young to get a job, you really SHOULD be focusing on school.)", "NTA. Setting boundaries with your parents is difficult. I would suggest coming up with a few alternative places to work. Maybe an after school childcare program through your school district? Or something that aligns with a career interest for the future? Then after you gather the info, call a family meeting and go over your plan. You don't need to ask permission to work or change jobs. You are making sure they are in the loop and have all the info. Good luck!", "NTA for wanting to quit and vocalizing that, it is a big undertaking to do school and work and not have time for yourself. However, are you sure your $ is actually being put to a savings account and not being eaten into by your parents? Their reaction is raising red flags and I\u2019d be very concerned if there\u2019s a risk of that and they\u2019ve been relying on your income.", "The point of not wanting you to grow up lazy and spoiled is fine and all, but thats the point of house chores, not a full on job. All piling a job on top of school does for most people is build up stress. Sure, some people can handle it and handle it extraordinarily well, but a lot of people cant. Especially a job that can be as draining as working in a restaurant.\n\nNTA. They're trying to push too much on to you, as a minor, its kinda your guardians jobs to take care of you, and if you want a job at that age it should be so you have money so you can go out and do stuff with friends. Not to shove it all into a savings (although putting a portion in savings is in fact a good idea).", "Nta", "They\u2019re treating you like crap.

I did school Monday to Friday and worked a grocery shop job 7 - 4 Saturday and Sunday. It was exhausting. Your parents should have you prioritise school right now.", "NTA - you have to be able to cope, while it's good to have a job to save for university, you must prioritise your mental health and studies. How many hours a week are you doing?", "ESH- Of course your mental health and well being are important and this job sounds stressful, so I can understand why you would want to quit. \n\nBut, as a parent myself, it sounds like your parents feel your going to quit then spend that time laying around the house and going to them for money, and they are trying to instill a decent work ethic into you. \n\nRecommendation- ask them if you can find a different job. Don\u2019t quit till you have a new job lined up. Maybe something with less hours and/or have to deal with less people (like a stock person at a store or something). I feel like as long as they understand you are still willing to work just not at that location\u2026 they will probably understand better.", "NTA, but I suggest you apply for jobs while working. Then you can approach your parents and say I have been offered a better job that pays more and makes me happy. I think in there eyes if you quit you will slack on finding a new job and essentially hold off on working to \u201clay around\u201d", "NTA.  You\u2019re 15, and have been working since you were 14.  At most, your job should be VERY part time since school will be keeping you busy enough.  While crap jobs are good for everyone to experience, being expected to stay with it long past the time it starts hurting you isn\u2019t okay.  If you can, talk to a counselor at school for help.  This isn\u2019t okay.", "Can you find a different job? I had a job I loved through hs and into college, and made it my profession, so it was easier for me. My brief stint in a restaurant convinced me that was not my career.\n\nWhat else would you like to do? Perhaps your school counselor could help?\n\nNTA.", "you got a job at 14??? is that legal? i got a job at 15.5 and felt the same way. college was even worse. get used to it... it\u2019s pretty much how the rest of your life will likely be. except when school ends, if you have children, it\u2019ll just be their school you\u2019re worried about. it\u2019s a cycle. welcome to life. (advice? wait to have kids. take a break between high school and college and fuck what anyone says about it - if you even wanna go to college).\n\nBUT that being said. you\u2019re too young to be that tired. i\u2019m sorry your parents aren\u2019t being understanding. i do get both sides though. but think your parents are being a little much. NTA.", "I\u2019m 99% sure. I get access to my money if I ask and have a good reason and see the bank account when I ask to.", "I work 9am-4pm Saturday and Sunday. I don\u2019t think I would find it that bad if school wasn\u2019t in the way.", "i\u2019m willing to find a new job, i\u2019ve told them that. but every time i do they shut me down again and tell me i\u2019m not allowed to quit", "Those hours are fine if you have a day off in between, but you don't from what you've been saying. Essentially, right now you're working seven days a week and that will lead to severe stress if not cut off.", "Have they given you a reason? You keep saying they shut you down\u2026 but you haven\u2019t said why they feel this way, especially if they understand you are willing to find a new job before you quit\n\nEdit: the before you quit is a key point\u2026 saying I\u2019ll quit today then find something later sounds like\u2026 I\u2019ll give you an answer you want to hear but won\u2019t actually find a new job later.", "They never gave me a reason, the only reason I could think of is that they like my boss. Before I quit I would find a new job I told them that because I don\u2019t want to become a lazy child that lays in bed all day. But that\u2019s the only reason I think they want me to stay"]}
