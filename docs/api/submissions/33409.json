When did it become  expected to be served at 'family events'? If its clearly buffet style set up.....", "NTA, I\u2019m also Australian and I can\u2019t ever remember having anything but a family style serve yourself lunch. Maybe when I was younger and someone was getting dessert they might have offered to get me some as they where getting some for themselves so I didn\u2019t go stupid and try and eat a whole trifle but certainly not since I was a teenager. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t expect the person who prepared it all to serve it all, that\u2019s just totally UnAustralian\u2026\u2026..", "NTA I love doing meals family style and helping yourself. not means everyone can take as much or little as they want of whichever foods they want and stops people feeling obligated to eat something they don\u2019t like because it\u2019s been put on their plate. If the main meal was help yourself there\u2019s no reason desert would be different especially when you\u2019ve set it on the table for folk to pick their own bits. MIL is just being weird and entitled to think you should be serving her.", "NTA for serving a buffet, and MIL does sound extra and annoying, but maybe ease up on the \u201cold bag\u201d thing?", "NTA", "I see a lot of N t A here but I think YTA. Why? Because you sound angry at your BIL for canceling the 3 guests and taking their gifts. That\u2019s where you could have let off a little steam and not presented gifts for him to take home but instead to say, \u201cOh I have gifts ready for the children whenever they come to see me.\u201d I could totally see my mother doing that, and if those family members don\u2019t come by they don\u2019t get the gifts. That would be a reasonable and well placed way to release your frustration. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what problem you have with your MIL. Cleaning your house is a normal part of hosting a dinner so you can\u2019t be mad at her that you had to clean. Same with preparing the food. You chose to make three courses. Lovely, but don\u2019t be mad at her about it. \n\nSo when she asked to be served it\u2019s just the teeniest inconvenience to you for either simplicity or a show of respect or kindness or hospitality. You could have declined and said, oh help yourself to whatever you like and been pleasant about it. The fact that you say you \u201cstood your ground\u201d and called her an old bag twice indicates you viewed this as some sort of show down or power play. Judging by the content of your post only, you behaved rudely. It sounds like you took out your anger about hosting or the canceled guests on her. \n\nYTA. Just be honest with yourself about who you\u2019re mad at and why. Did you resent hosting? Did your partner or a family member say you\u2019d host and then leave all the work to you? Does your MIL never host and always criticize you? Were you sad to be apart from your own family? Your anger about \u201cthe old bag\u201d and your standing up to her are extremely out of place based on the situation you described. What\u2019s this really about?", ">When I served dessert, in front of my mil, she said \u201c aren\u2019t you going to serve me?\u201d\n\nI don't understand why you worded it this way. You served dessert to everyone else, so why did you skip her?\n\n>So pleased with myself for standing my ground and letting the old bag serve her own self\n\nThat's rude. The way you worded that makes it sound like there's a lot here that you're *not* telling us.", "[deleted]", "Wow, you sound so rude.", "YTA. You\u2019re calling her old bag and haven\u2019t given a reason to do this other than you\u2019re a little miffed that you had to do this at all. You invited them over. What\u2019s the problem with serving your elder a dessert. You just don\u2019t seem to like your in laws.", "NTA. Wow that\u2019s so rude, coming from another Aussie people pleaser, go you! I understand the pressure.", "Nta she could've asked nicely", "NTA. I don\u2019t think \u201cyou\u2019re good to do your own thing\u201d was even rude at all.

Damn, you missed the opportunity to tell her no because you thought she was probably trying to slim down and didn't want to pressure her to eat more.", "NTA.

I would ask him if he's ok with (strongly disliked) dish? Or just make it with everything he hates.

You keep saying family-style though when referring to hosting a meal with your family. Shouldn't \"family-style\" be implied? \n\nI think you should reframe how you talk about this incident.

That way it makes it super clear that your MIL is TA.", "Does entitlement count?", "Love it.", "the host only loses the power to give very tiny portions or end-pieces only... lol", "Right?!? Who wants to be served unless there are mobility issues? Maybe I want a double portion of one thing and a sliver of another.", "Aren't you going to serve me? - Is pretty rude given the situation. What OP said wasn't overly kind but seems appropriate. I have a MIL that's used to being catered to, and for better or worse, blunt-ish comments or very passive-aggressive actions are the only things that seem to break through, even if only temporarily. Like most women, unfortunately, I have a lot of ingrained people pleasing thoughts and related guilt.

I'm so sorry this happened to you and your siblings. What a cruel and abusive thing to do.", "Do we have the same dad? Same exact experience,  just on Easter", "Fair points, but I imagine OP did not show her true feelings to the MIL. Her phrasing \"nope, you\u2019re good to do your own thing\u201d can come across pleasantly or not depending on the tone of voice and facial expression. It sounds like she made an effort to appear pleasant but then sort of vented her true feelings here. So I'm going with NTA.\n\nHaving said that, if there is a history of this kind of passive aggression in the family, you might want to plan for situations like this so that you are not caught off guard. Have a response ready to go so that you can maintain your own composure. If this behavior is representative of their character, then it's truly not personal--they're just miserable people. Don't let them make *you* miserable.", "OP \u201cserved\u201d by bringing the food out and putting it on the table, it was family style (buffet).
