(Not really judging him for this per say as I had my own bout with alcoholism and am coming up on 3 years sober.)\n\nThe main reason I don't like her brother is he generally makes me feel unsafe. He continues to drink, and his sister allows it, when at the house despite my suggestion that he shouldn't be drinking here because I don't want to be involved in him breaking his parole. For which I basically get told that they will do what they want because his girlfriend lives here too. (No, she doesn't really contribute to the household except for a little here and there as she is currently unemployed. Most bulls are paid for by my brother and myself.)\n\nOn top of this, she has made numerous comments that my cat's life would be in danger if her brother moves in and my cat happens to go after her brother's bird. When I suggested that they could simply place the bird cage somewhere else in the house, as the room he would be moving into connects to mine, I got told that wouldn't be fair to him to nit have his bird in his bedroom with him and that I should just lock my cat in my room. (Can't really do that as my room still doesn't have a door I can fully close anyway.)\n\nMy brother has been present for basically all of these conversations and chooses to remain a bystander. And even when he gets involved it is always on behalf of his girlfriend and he rarely hears my side on anything.\n\nThe reason I feel I would be the asshole is I know that if I move out my brother won't be able to afford the current place by himself and would likely lose the house he has spent almost two years paying towards. But I just can't get over the fact that I feel pressured to be okay with someone moving in that I don't get along with, nor would feel safe around.\n\nSo people of Reddit, would I be the asshole here?\n\nEdit 1: First off, I want to thank all of you who have responded. I have been reading then so I am here to answer some common questions I am seeing.\n\nFirstly, my brother owns the house and I rent a room and such from him in it. \n\nSecondly, while I won't get into the specifics of what the brother did. I will say that they were things done \"under the influence,\" and sobriety is a part of their parole.\n\nThirdly, her brother does work, but doesn't drive. So I have no idea how he would get to his job in the next town over if he moves in. I can say for certain I would not be taking him to work.\n\nI will do another edit to answer more frequent questions as well", "created_utc": 1685332342, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uk22h/wibta_if_i_threatened_to_move_out_if_my_brothers/", "score": 494, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your cat is endangered, and you do bot like the baggage his alcohol and legal problem will bring into the home. Your brother is choosing this for himself, so you should not feel bad at all.

Protect yourself, because your brother isn't protecting you. Who cares whether he can't pay the rent? Clearly he is not reading the handwriting on the wall. \n\nI suggest that you make a well-thought-out presentation to him about the realities of the situation, and include the ultimatum that you will leave if GF's brother moves in, and that's final. This will apply even if your brother lies to you and lets GF's brother move in in three or six months or a year after promising that he won't.

If you moved out and he moved in, then the other brother could pick up covering what you previously were. \n\nYour brother\u2019s a total ass by thinking it would be okay to move an alcoholic into the house with a recovering one. That\u2019s straight up asinine in and of itself.\n\nCongratulations on your sobriety, btw.", "NTA. If you're not on the deed to the house and are just paying rent and your brother can't afford it without you, well then he made a bad decision. You need to do what is best for you. Let his girlfriend and her brother step up.", "INFO: is sobriety part of his parole?

If your brother was looking out for you as well, he wouldn't do that.", "NTA. The house is 50% yours (since the GF isn't paying), so you have a 50% say in who else is moving in. You don't want GF's brother, so he won't get in. Your reasons are valid. You are on the wagon, so it would be extremely difficult for you to be around an alcoholic. Besides that, you feel unsafe, the other three would probably 'gang up' on you and overrule everything you think important, and the specific threats against your cat. Tell brother that if GF's brother moves in, you move out. Why feel guilty about him not being able to pay for the house? If he can't afford it, he can start asking rent from his GF and her brother, now can't he? Problem fixed. It's not your problem they are freeloaders.", "NTA.

Holy crap, no.\n\nMove.  Leave *before* any move-in by this reprobate happens.  The threat against your cat cannot be ignored.\n\nIf your brother suffers consequences for that, well, that was his choice when he entertained this stupid idea to bring the brother in.  He bought a house he can't afford without a paying roommate, and while in this market I get it, being without a paying roommate for a time was always a risk.  You do not have to subsidize his purchase nor support his freeloaders.  Maybe his girlfriend or her brother can get a job.", "Dude they threatened your cat. I mean the threat to your sobriety is bad too, but saying your pet is IN DANGER from this guy...  \nGet yourself and your kitty out of there and don't worry about anything else! NTA. Your brother's financial situation isn't your responsibility.", "NTA.  Explain to your brother that you don\u2019t feel safe around the guy.  Tell him that you\u2019ll respect his decision if the guy moves in, but that you will also then be moving out, because you value your life and that of your cat, and don\u2019t want to feel uncomfortable and unsafe in your home.  He can then make the choice.  You aren\u2019t the one putting your brother\u2019s investment at risk - because he will have made the choice. The gf and her brother will then have to step up on the financial contributions.", "As a nearly thirty year old man, I could not imagine living with a guy in his early twenties, and that's not even addressing the rest of this shit show. NTA, but everyone else is. The girlfriend's figured out it's a sweet deal and now she wants her brother to be able to mooch off not only her boyfriend but his brother as well.

Better be safe than sorry, NTA", "NTA but you need to talk to your brother about it. His girlfriend doesn't seem to understand either. I'd probably let then know exactly how you feel and let the chips fall where they may.", "NTA. Your brother is an adult. You aren\u2019t responsible for making sure he can afford his living arrangements. You need to look after yourself; if that means moving, then move.", "NTA, and I would definitely look into moving out ASAP. It sounds like you're already paying more than your share for your brother's girlfriend to live there, and now they want you to put up with her criminal brother living there too? That would be a hard no from me.", "Nta. For me I'd already be moving out. If they're willing to force this through I wouldn't even give more than a week notice. I'd slowly get my stuff out as I would put retaliation past them given their behaviour up to now.", "NTA lay it all out for  your brother like you did here. He has a choice.

Let them know that with the new roommate they want to bring in that you\u2019ve decided to move on since between the three of them they would be able to cover the bills.

So basically you and your brother are the only people paying bills and the gf is completely fine basically trying to force another person you aren\u2019t comfortable with in the house while threatening your sobriety and the life of your cat? She really isn\u2019t smart.", "NTA. Drunkard breaking his parole and threatening to kill your cat. I would have a private discussion with your brother that if the bro moves in, you move out.

You are free to move out. Are you paying 50/50. If so your bills are going to increase a lot as I doubt brother won't be paying either.", "NTA.\n\nAs a recovering alcoholic (congratulations on approaching three years sober, that's no mean feat and you should be proud of yourself!), you have every right -- and, indeed, responsibility -- to protect yourself, your mental health and your sobriety by limiting your exposure to any alcoholics who currently aren't facing up to their situation and who therefore have the potential to undo all your hard work. You are absolutely right to consider this risk factor and to make the decision that's best for you. There's a difference between selfishness and self-preservation, and this is very much about self-preservation.\n\nIt looks like the girlfriend is already using the brother to gang up on you in your own home, and this will only get worse if he moves in. Relating this back to the previous paragraph, you will rapidly lose control of your ability to control your safe space for your continued recovery. You will receive no support from the girlfriend because she's too busy enabling her brother. There may be an element of manipulation going on here: she's clearly using him to get her way in the house and may be banking on the fact that moving him in will ensure that she can transform the house into what she wants, regardless of what anyone else wants. She's made it very clear that your sobriety and mental health means nothing to her, and it doesn't sound like your cat is safe either.\n\nAs long as your brother stands by and doesn't interfere, he's enabling his girlfriend to run roughshod over you. A lot of people think that standing back means they're staying out of it or staying neutral. They're not. If you're not interfering with bad behaviour or bullying or threats to your brother's health, you're actually enabling it. So, stop thinking of him as a bystander. He's passively siding with his girlfriend against you (on top of actively siding with her when he does get involved). He is being a bad brother to you. She is also being a bad brother to her own brother by enabling his own problems. So, neither of them are in the queue for any \"best sibling of the year\" awards. They're not in line for any \"animal lover of the year\" awards either.\n\nI think you're absolutely right to put your foot down. Even if you didn't have sobriety and the life of your cat to worry about, not getting along with a person is a completely valid reason all by itself for not agreeing to a houseshare. There is nothing more miserable for anyone than two housemates who are incompatible. Be up front about the ultimatum, and if they accuse you of throwing a \"me or him\" choice at them, own it, but keep it neutral -- you're telling them what the options are and what the consequences of each choice will be. But, once you've told them that if they override you and let him move in, you will have to stick to your guns and start looking for somewhere else to live if they do call your bluff and let him move in.\n\nIn fact, though you probably don't want to, it's clear that living under the same roof as the girlfriend isn't working for you (or your cat). So, if you're in a financial position to find your own place that doesn't include them, you might want to consider doing that even if the girlfriend's brother doesn't move in. Yes, you mention that you want to be considerate of your brother's financial position, but as long as your brother does not care about your mental health and sobriety, then you have to protect your safety (and your cat, apparently!) above your brother's finances. His finances are for him to worry about, not you.\n\nWhatever you decide to do, good luck, and long may you continue on the path you're already successfully walking. And I hope your cat is able to continue walking it with you!", "NTA  But this shouldn't be made as a threat.  This should just be a statement of what is going to happen if he moves in.
