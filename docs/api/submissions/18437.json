Protect yourself, because your brother isn't protecting you. Who cares whether he can't pay the rent? Clearly he is not reading the handwriting on the wall. \n\nI suggest that you make a well-thought-out presentation to him about the realities of the situation, and include the ultimatum that you will leave if GF's brother moves in, and that's final. This will apply even if your brother lies to you and lets GF's brother move in in three or six months or a year after promising that he won't.

That\u2019s straight up asinine in and of itself.\n\nCongratulations on your sobriety, btw.", "NTA. If you're not on the deed to the house and are just paying rent and your brother can't afford it without you, well then he made a bad decision. You need to do what is best for you. Let his girlfriend and her brother step up.", "INFO: is sobriety part of his parole?

You don't want GF's brother, so he won't get in. Your reasons are valid. You are on the wagon, so it would be extremely difficult for you to be around an alcoholic. Besides that, you feel unsafe, the other three would probably 'gang up' on you and overrule everything you think important, and the specific threats against your cat. Tell brother that if GF's brother moves in, you move out. Why feel guilty about him not being able to pay for the house?

Holy crap, no.\n\nMove.  Leave *before* any move-in by this reprobate happens.  The threat against your cat cannot be ignored.\n\nIf your brother suffers consequences for that, well, that was his choice when he entertained this stupid idea to bring the brother in.  He bought a house he can't afford without a paying roommate, and while in this market I get it, being without a paying roommate for a time was always a risk.  You do not have to subsidize his purchase nor support his freeloaders.  Maybe his girlfriend or her brother can get a job.", "Dude they threatened your cat. I mean the threat to your sobriety is bad too, but saying your pet is IN DANGER from this guy...  \nGet yourself and your kitty out of there and don't worry about anything else! NTA. Your brother's financial situation isn't your responsibility.", "NTA.  Explain to your brother that you don\u2019t feel safe around the guy.  Tell him that you\u2019ll respect his decision if the guy moves in, but that you will also then be moving out, because you value your life and that of your cat, and don\u2019t want to feel uncomfortable and unsafe in your home.  He can then make the choice.  You aren\u2019t the one putting your brother\u2019s investment at risk - because he will have made the choice.

Better be safe than sorry, NTA", "NTA but you need to talk to your brother about it. His girlfriend doesn't seem to understand either. I'd probably let then know exactly how you feel and let the chips fall where they may.", "NTA. Your brother is an adult.

It sounds like you're already paying more than your share for your brother's girlfriend to live there, and now they want you to put up with her criminal brother living there too? That would be a hard no from me.", "Nta. For me I'd already be moving out. If they're willing to force this through I wouldn't even give more than a week notice.

Let them know that with the new roommate they want to bring in that you\u2019ve decided to move on since between the three of them they would be able to cover the bills.

Him breaking parole will get him out of your hair at least. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "2 mooching and the cowardly brother.", "It sounds like Brother owns the house and OP rents from him, so that's not applicable. All OP can do is threaten to leave, that's their whole hand. Brother ultimately has all the say, but as consequence, OP can leave whenever they want. \n\nNTA.", "I am hoping that is because the alcohol part came first.", "Even if this is correct, I'd say it's OP who holds all the cards. The brother can effectively have all the say, but as soon as OP's gone they won't have a place to have that say in. Mutually assured destruction. \ud83d\ude01", "I understand op s brother bought the house and of course the title is in his name.\n\n That being said if they each pay half ( op no requesting equity in the house) and brother is  unable to pay alone op has a heavy word to say there too cause if he leaves brother not only doesn't have a house but looses also everything he invested. \n\nOp can't mortage the house and other stuff of course,not being the owner , true.  But brother would be indeed a moron to ignore the danger just because his gf wants to act like she owns the place when she has contributed 0 till now. ( Officially only brother decides I mean but he should be smart enough to recognize that op s word due to him paying half his mortage is wayyyy more important the the gf entitlement).", "Haha. Exactly what I was trying to say. It's only one card, but it's the \"game over\" card."]}
