(Not really judging him for this per say as I had my own bout with alcoholism and am coming up on 3 years sober.)\n\nThe main reason I don't like her brother is he generally makes me feel unsafe. He continues to drink, and his sister allows it, when at the house despite my suggestion that he shouldn't be drinking here because I don't want to be involved in him breaking his parole. For which I basically get told that they will do what they want because his girlfriend lives here too. (No, she doesn't really contribute to the household except for a little here and there as she is currently unemployed. Most bulls are paid for by my brother and myself.)\n\nOn top of this, she has made numerous comments that my cat's life would be in danger if her brother moves in and my cat happens to go after her brother's bird. When I suggested that they could simply place the bird cage somewhere else in the house, as the room he would be moving into connects to mine, I got told that wouldn't be fair to him to nit have his bird in his bedroom with him and that I should just lock my cat in my room. (Can't really do that as my room still doesn't have a door I can fully close anyway.)\n\nMy brother has been present for basically all of these conversations and chooses to remain a bystander. And even when he gets involved it is always on behalf of his girlfriend and he rarely hears my side on anything.\n\nThe reason I feel I would be the asshole is I know that if I move out my brother won't be able to afford the current place by himself and would likely lose the house he has spent almost two years paying towards. But I just can't get over the fact that I feel pressured to be okay with someone moving in that I don't get along with, nor would feel safe around.\n\nSo people of Reddit, would I be the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1685332342, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uk22h/wibta_if_i_threatened_to_move_out_if_my_brothers/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't feel safe. You don't like these people. Your cat isn't safe, and you don't even have a locking door. They contribute noting, and you should be able to veto their presence. Move out. Find a safe space. Let him figure it out and don't let him talk you into it because it'll just 'be all right' and 'you're being oversensitive.' You aren't. Get out now. NTA", "Tell your brother up front -- make it *extremely* clear -- that if they move the brother in, **you will be moving out**. Tell him that this is NOT negotiable, so he needs to decide what's most important to him-- being able to afford to live there, or not being able to afford it because of 2 deadbeat roommates who aren't paying their share.\n\nAlso, it's my understanding that in order for a parolee to be released to a living address, the residents there **all** have to give permission for that to happen. YWNBTA to contact the parole office, and tell them that you do ***not*** give approval for her brother to be paroled at your address.", "YWNBTA\n\nIf you\u2019re paying to live there, you\u2019re more important than anyone that doesn\u2019t pay. \n\nWith that, comes the safety of yourself, your animals, and your belongings, and if that is something that becomes questionable with the new dynamic, then you can certainly move out without being the AH.", "So you are going to pay for her and her brother to live there? Have to walk on eggshells? Jeopardize your own sobriety and sanity? And lock your poor kitty up? Nope! Time to move. Your brother is a big boy let him figure it out as he isn't to worried about you. NTA!", "Solely for this bit:\n> Her brother has had long-standing problems with alcohol. [...]I had my own bout with alcoholism and am coming up on 3 years sober. [...] He continues to drink, and his sister allows it, \n\nYWNBTA. That's a straight up threat to your sobriety to have somebody like that living in the same house. You're a recovering alcoholic.", "YWNBTA \n\nYou signed the lease to live with your brother, not to live with your brother's girlfriend's brother. \nThe girlfriend and brother sounds like AHs suggesting a cat should be confined to a room.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nNope. Stand your ground. Those are very valid reasons, and I would be furious if I got told my animals lives were in danger because of someone else and they do blatantly nothing to help the situation. \n\nHe does not get to just move in wherever he wants when the people that love there don't want it.", "NTA and you\u2019ll be doing a massive disservice to yourself and honestly might end up not only resenting your brother but putting a strain/ ruining your relationship with him if you continue to live there, move out and let them handle it they are adults & you are not their caregiver you\u2019d actually be enabling the fuck out of the gf and brother too which what do entitled people do when enabled? They often escalate right now it\u2019s this issue but once they are moved In and your paying their rent and bills what else is it going to be?", "Oh hell no NTA that's baloney for the gf that pays zero to move her brother in and change/make new rules of the house.", "NTA\nYou aren\u2019t obligated to stay somewhere you don\u2019t feel comfortable.", "NTA. You shouldn't threaten to move out. You should move out. The situation is not going to improve, whether the brother moves in or not. You'll be much happier in your own accommodations and it sounds like you'll be much better able to control and maintain your sobriety elsewhere.", "NTA. The gf shouldn\u2019t be considering moving anyone in or making any comments if she\u2019s not paying anything!", "Honestly, you had me at that title.  You\u2019re not obligated to allow an extra roommate; I don\u2019t care if the guy was 30 years sober and your sponsor.  \n\nStart looking for places.", "NTA, yes your brother can afford the house, he has made the choice to let free loaders in the house -GF and her brother.  Get out as soon as possible.  Another issue is that he is on parole and should not be drinking and does in the house.  What is on parole for?  Do you really want that in your home?  Better to find your own home for you and your fur baby.", "NTA. It's real simple. If his girlfriend's brother moves in then you will be moving out asap. He can either keep his unemployed girlfriend happy or keep a roof over their heads. The choice is his.", "Ywnbta at all. You are entitled to peace and safety in your own home. Your cat is endangered, and you do bot like the baggage his alcohol and legal problem will bring into the home. Your brother is choosing this for himself, so you should not feel bad at all. He might blame you for shouldering him with more financial difficulties, but he's got two other roommates now that can alleviate some of that. Put your valuables in a secure location outside the house. It seems like you don't trust her or her brother much.", "NTA. Your sobriety is more important than her brother moving in.", "Move out, let your bro deal with his own life shit fuck it. NTA", "Who tf are these people?! The GF doesn\u2019t pay the bills and now wants to bring her creepy brother over too as she just casually mentions oh yeah watch out for your cat? Fck no, move out *yesterday*!

If you're able to afford it yourself, I would move out. GF can contribute more to help your brother or they can get another roommate.", "NTA. Protect yourself, because your brother isn't protecting you. Who cares whether he can't pay the rent? Clearly he is not reading the handwriting on the wall. \n\nI suggest that you make a well-thought-out presentation to him about the realities of the situation, and include the ultimatum that you will leave if GF's brother moves in, and that's final. This will apply even if your brother lies to you and lets GF's brother move in in three or six months or a year after promising that he won't. This will apply even if GF's brother doesn't \"live\" there but is there day and night. There will be nothing left to negotiate,", "oh my god if theyre even willing to admit theres a slight chance of a threat to your cats life that means the brother is def gonna kill your cat no way they can find someone else or you\u2019ll leave i would NOT risk it NTA", "NTA... get ready to move out. They are using you.", "NTA\n\nStand. Your. Ground.\n\nIf he needa you there he must make compromises to accommodate you.\n\nIf not too bad so sad you are out and he can deal with it all on his own.\n\nYou should feel safe ans secure in your safe space that YOU PAY FOR. \n\nIf your brother insists on allowing his girl to run the house and both be dismissive of your feelings and wants about your safety and the safety of your pet then it may be time for you to move on to greener pastures.", "You wouldn\u2019t be TA. If you moved out and he moved in, then the other brother could pick up covering what you previously were. \n\nYour brother\u2019s a total ass by thinking it would be okay to move an alcoholic into the house with a recovering one. That\u2019s straight up asinine in and of itself.\n\nCongratulations on your sobriety, btw.", "NTA. If you're not on the deed to the house and are just paying rent and your brother can't afford it without you, well then he made a bad decision. You need to do what is best for you. Let his girlfriend and her brother step up.", "INFO: is sobriety part of his parole? Yikes \n\nCall me a narc or whatever, but if I was faced with living with this dude and all his red flags or calling his PO\u2026. Well. Just call me a narc.", "NTA. \n\nYour safety and that if your cat are important. If the guy moving in is more important to them than keeping the house, so be it.\n\nThey don't expect you to threaten to move but if you say so you will have to be prepared to move.\n\nIt might be best since she has threatened your cat. Find a place to move but move without their help and change your address immediately", "YWNBTA. Your boundaries aren't being respected, and your brother clearly doesn't care for your well being or peace of mind. Everyone involved is old enough to be responsible for themselves. And looking after your own safety and the safety of your pet is part of you being responsible for yourself.", "This exactly true.  YWNTA", "Also the brother is breaking the terms of his parole there by drinking!", "Oof thinking of the lease is a big thing OP has to look over asap too. These people are already awful so if he doesn\u2019t make sure hes taken off the lease and every autopay bill they seem like they\u2019d continue to make things difficult for him. Also there might be limits to their lease like a certain amount of people, adding people, whatever. Be careful, OP!", "And seriously have their cat hurt! They told OP they\u2019re going to do this *and* threatened his pet?! They don\u2019t even live there yet and that\u2019s an insane way to live!", "\"He might blame you for shouldering him with more financial difficulties\"\n\nBrother will have not one but two deadbeats living with him. OP will have noting to do with his losing the property, if that's what winds up happening because of his bad decisions.", "Probably even if alcohol lives in a cupboard there."]}
