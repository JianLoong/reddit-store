My girlfriend liked to host parties, and when he reached his first birthday, she wanted to have a big birthday party, but I managed to convince her to massively downsize to just us, our parents and siblings, and just have some cake, little guy was still too young.\n\nThe next year she again talked about her plans to have a big party for our 2yo, but again I told her it would be just close family and a cake and a happy birthday song. \n\nThis year she told me about her plans and again I told her to just do something small, but this time she was frustrated and told me to let her do something bigger for our son for once. I explained that it is ridiculous to have such big parties for toddlers, they will not remember anything. For example, when I was 2, my family threw me a huge birthday party, the theme was Toy Story, which had just come out. I have no recollection of it, just some VHS tapes of me looking stupid in a Woody costume while the older kids had fun on their own.\n\nShe said it doesn't matter because there will be lots of people taking pictures and he can just see them when he gets older. I told her again that it would just be having fun at his expense, the little guy is a heavy sleeper who plays and runs for 30 minutes and then falls asleep on a sofa or a chair or his bed. \n\nShe still doesn't understand my point of view, it's not like he won't ever have a birthday party, we should just wait until he's like 6 or 7, you know, when he can actually remember.\n\nMy girlfriend is still mad at me and says she is going to plan a birthday party whether I like it or not. I tried talking to her mom to see if she could talk some sense into her, only to be verbally slammed by her, telling me I'm depriving my child of a childhood. My mom says I should just do what my girlfriend says because Dad's word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy over this.

You don't remember your Toy Story bday, but your parents probably do. Maybe they don't look back on the videos now, but they may have when you were 5 or 6, or hell my mom told me when I went to college her and my dad sat down and watched all of my VHS even though they never did. She told me that to implore me to take every video/picture I possibly could of my kid and to save them. \n\nYou've poo-poo'd your GF desires for 2 years. She gets this.\n\nIt would be one thing if she was asking you to do a million things. She just wants to do what gives her joy for her child. Not only should you have already backed off, you certainly should not have tried to rally family/friends against her.", "YTA.  You got your way for two years - if she likes planning events like these, you should not take it away from her. Some day you might regret not having those cute pictures to share.  For now, you kind of just sound like you are close minded to what **she** wants to do for **her** child.  And, going behind her back to talk to her mom (to try to get your way) is a real jerk move.", "So you shouldn\u2019t do anything fun with your kids until they\u2019re old enough to remember? Why bring them to the park? Why read them books? Why watch movies with them? Why do anything fun at all until they can have a memory of it? \nDo you see how stupid that sounds? \nYTA", "YTA\n\nWhy is it always your way, and never hers? You got your level of party the first two years, why can't she celebrate her child how she wants to this year \n\n\n\nBut on larger issue, you really need to examine why you think that your child's experiences don't matter unless he can remember them. Like, he still experiences those moments and it helps shape who his is whether he remembers it when he's 30 or not.\n\nHe won't remember being snuggled and hugged as a newborn, but it mattered to him in the moment, and taught him that you were a source of comfort and security\n\nHe won't remember his first trip to the park or the zoo, but it mattered to him in the moment and taught him the joys of exploring new places.\n\nHe won't remember all the times you comforted him when he hurt himself and cried as he hurt himself learning to walk and run, but it mattered on the moment and taught him that he can come to you when life gets hard.\n\n\nIf nothing matters before age 6 because he won't remember anything, might as well ship him off to an orphanage until then right? Cause he won't remember and it's the same as him not experiencing any of his first six years? \n\nLet him have that day to feel loved and special and celebrated.", "YTA for sure. You're depriving everyone involved of a good time for pretty much no reason. He may not remember the party in 20 years, but he'll have a good time in the moment, and you can take pictures and videos for yourselves and him to look back on. By your logic, you should never do anything fun with him because he won't remember", "YTA. You wife is trying to build memories for your family, you already deny it two times and you find that stupid, may be you don't remember your Toy Story birthday, but your parents do. Birthday is a good occasion for family time, to have all the kids having fun, to spend time with your family and to build memories.", "YTA. She wants memories you callous dork.", "Omg YTA do you deprive him of all fun and joy because he won't be able to reminisce about it later? \n\nDo you make her leave him at home when you go to the beach or the park because it's not worth it unless it becomes a core memory? \n\nPeople don't give parties for babies because they don't know wtf a party is. If you've ever spent time around a three year old, you'd very much understand what having a big celebration would mean to them.\n\nMy daughter picked the theme and decorations for her third birthday. She's 6 now and still talks about her first party fondly.\n\nNot to mention, this is obviously something that would bring your wife a lot of happiness. Does that in itself not make it worth it? Your opinion isn't the only one that matters, especially if it's based off of arbitrary assumptions of when your kid will start forming long lasting memories. \n\nYTA and a joyless tyrant.", "Massive YTA\n\nYour girlfriend is right. Let her organise something for the poor little kid. The fact that you don't looking back at those pictures doesn't mean that he won't look back at these parties. You're being unreasonable and the fact that you told her no twice and you're doing it again for something that *she* wants to do for her son is not compromising at all. You're just shoving what you think is right onto her.\n\nThis is a relationship. Compromises are necessary.", "YTA. The birthday isn't just about whether he'll remember it. It's about celebrating him with those close to you. You'll have pics & video and hopefully good memories to look back on. I know now it is hard to see much into the future but believe me the years will pass by faster than you realize. When you get older you're going to wish you had more pics of him at this age.", "YTA.  Sounds she you got what YOU wanted for the first two bdays, but you want 3/3 to be your way because that's the way YOU see it.  Childrens bday parties are to also celebrate the child together with family and friends.  You owe a compromise here.", "YTA. Let her have the party. But push it's a get together cake and good times few gifts. At 3 the kid doesn't need a bunch of gifts he won't remember in a week. By 4 and 5 you do remember. At 4 I remember a steel bank that was welded together painted blue. Don't have a clue what happened to it.", "YTA.  I HATE when people say the child \u201cwon\u2019t remember it\u201d.  Does it matter, or is it if he has fun?  Yes, he can do other things to have fun, but as long as he could enjoy it who cares!  And it shouldn\u2019t be what you will \u201callow\u201d.  If you guys can\u2019t afford it or another logical reason to not throw a huge party I get that, but just because you \u201csay so\u201d?  Go somewhere else with that.", "YTA. Yes, I agree that a 3-year old kid probably won't care about a huge party. Your gf clearly does though, and she already gave in the past two years. Just let she have it the way she wants this time.\n\nAlso you're acting like you're the one person who has seen the truth about life when you say things like \"she still doesn't understand my point of view\" (yeah, it's clearly you who understand hers, having things your way twice already and being so annoyed when it might be the other way) and \"I tried talking to her mom to see if she could talk some sense into her\" (because you're clearly right about everything and people not following your view are not in their right minds).", "YTA. You're technically correct in all your statements, but you're missing the point. A funeral is also useless by your metrics, as the deceased cannot experience it. Events like this are for the memories you can form as parents, not for the kid.", "YTA\u2026 plus you complained to her mom?? Really?? Grow up.", "YTA. A huge party? (By which I mean like over 20 people) No. But why not some of his friends and their parents?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be fancy or extravagant. Fruit and veg platter. Cupcakes. Pizza. Some streamers. \n\nYour son may not remember the party (and he might! My 4yo remembers her third), but your gf will. You will. These parties are also for her, to celebrate these early years when the wonder of a cake and candles is still new. When he\u2019ll still let you put the hat on his head. When he might want a little help opening the wrapping paper. \n\n(Now, I love themed parties. I do fun homemade themes and puns every year. It has been worth the work every dang time.) \n\nBy your logic you also shouldn\u2019t do Christmas. Or Easter or Canada Day barbecues or Hannukah. Oh wait - those days are for the whole family to celebrate\u2026\u2026just like his birthday.", "YTA\n\nThe party isn't just for the kid.  It's for the family to  celebrate you and the kid.\n\nDo you have the same feelings about anniversaries?  \"Honey, 1st anniversary is just the paper anniversary.  Let's at least wait until the Iron  Anniversary.  That has meaning AND heft.\"\n\nGood luck!", "YTA \n\nYour partner wants to throw your child a birthday party. And you said no.... Wow.", "YTA. \n\nShe did it your way for two years. It\u2019s time she gets to do it her way. You know - the whole concept of compromise.\n\nIt seems like you\u2019re weirdly angry about your childhood birthday party. Kids aren\u2019t supposed to look sophisticated. They\u2019re supposed to have fun and be silly. They have a blast regardless whether it becomes a core memory.\n\nStop being unilateral in your decision making.\n\n(As an aside - your Mom is an AH too for what she said. The point is that dad and mom *equally* matter. And here we are back to compromise.)", "[removed]", "YTA \n\nSo you have convinced her two times already to not do what she clearly wants (which is a big party for her son). In what way will it hurt you or your son that she gets her way this time? Do you know the meaning of the word compromise?", "YTA. Huge AH!!! Just because they won't remember it, YOU will. Loved ones will. And he will get to see the \"memories\". Your way is not the only way. There has to be some compromise and she did for TWO YEARS. The only way you wouldn't be an AH is if you couldn't afford it. Calm down and let her plan something for your son. Sheesh.", "YTA, idk about you but I have vague memories of when I was around that age.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s a chance for friends and family to get together and spoil your son for the day, and celebrate his existence. Yeah, he might not remember it with perfect clarity, but he\u2019ll almost certainly enjoy it.\n\nIt\u2019s good to let your child experience these larger types of gatherings too. Gets them used to being in a room with a lot of people. \n\nAnd finally, if your gf REALLY wants to do it, why deprive her of it? She wants to do something nice for your son and she will clearly enjoy the planning too. I know you\u2019ve kinda fucked up already, but a really easy way to get back in her good graces would be to apologise and buy some decorations for the party. \n\nCmon, you have a son together and need to spend the rest of your lives with each other. Just get onboard with the party and who knows, you might even enjoy it?", "This is bizarre and YTA.  When my kids were 3, we had parties and invited their friends from daycare, and everybody had a good time.  Is it really because he won't remember it or is there another reason like money?", "YTA. \n\nLook, I get not wanting to throw a massive party EVERY year because that gets expensive. And I know the child isn\u2019t going to remember these parties. I think the first birthday of mine I remember was my 5th, and only a small part of it. \n\nBut parties at this age are really more for you guys as parents and other close adult family members. You come together to make it special and you take photos and videos that will be treasured for years to come. Your child will love looking back on the footage and hearing stories of the day. Consider that some older family members may not always be around to celebrate \u2014 these milestones are precious. I think it\u2019s sad you look back at your Toy Story party and think it to be silly instead of finding it joyous and appreciating the effort your family put into that. \n\nLastly\u2026 if your big reason to not have a proper party is that he won\u2019t remember it\u2026 then why do we bother doing anything with small children? Don\u2019t bother showing them your favourite childhood movies at this age, they won\u2019t remember. Don\u2019t go on any fun days out or to play outside, they won\u2019t remember. Ridiculous logic. \n\nApologise to your partner and love your child better.", "Yes YTA.  You, your gf and all the family will remember your son having a great time even if he doesn't remember.  Not sure why you are picking this hill to die on but you got your way the last two years, consider that a win.", "YTA - Have you never heard of compromising?  You got your way 2 years and you can't even give her 1. I cherish the photos of me with grandparents, great grandparents at my parties who died too young.\n\nPS.  Kids remember things before 6-7.  Usually 3 and up.", "I\u2019m 42 and I still remember my second birthday and every childhood birthday after that (and no, nobody took pictures I just remember and I know it was my second birthday because I also remember what I got as a gift). Now I know that\u2019s unusual, people say you don\u2019t have memories from early childhood once you become an adult but it was my daughters sixth birthday a few weeks ago and she suddenly asked me if it would be the same as the birthday when she came home and I had decorated everything and baked a cake. That was her third birthday. So even if he won\u2019t remember it when he\u2019s an adult he might still remember his third birthday a couple of years from now. Make it one to remember!", "Gentle YTA\n\nIt's about making memories. Not JUST for your child but for you as a family. And that may not mean much to you, but it clearly does to her.\n\nAs long as it's not too major of an expense for your budget, why not let her have that? And even if your child won't remember it later, that doesn't mean he won't enjoy it now.", "YTA for \u201cI told her\u201d alone. You do not get to make her decisions for her. If she wants to throw a party, she can.", "I understand your feelings. you are right that he won't remember. the party is not actually for him; i think that's what you are missing. No, it wouldn't be depriving him of his childhood LOL. It's depriving your gf and others from celebrating him at a party, even though he won't know or remember.", "Huge YTA. Why do you just not like your kid?", "YTA\n\nSometimes things aren't just so your kid will remember it - it's memories being made for you and her too. Also, I remember my 3rd birthday and I'm in my 30s now. So its very possible he might remember it too", "Yes huge YTA. God you sound awful! Your girlfriend is excited to celebrate your child and you are arguing with her about that?? Why did you even have a kid??", "Yta she's done your small parties then first 2 times.  At this age the parties are *for the adults*.  No, the kid won't remember but his mother will.\n\nShe absolutely understand your piont of view, she just, dun dun duuuuuuuun, doesn't agree!  Stop being a wet blanket.", "Toddler birthday parties are an excuse to get together with loved ones. No one expects the kiddo to remember it, it\u2019s about creating a joyful experience and spending time with friends and family. \n\nThe fact that you have been unilaterally deciding and dictating to your wife what kind of birthday party your kid is allowed to have makes you an AH. YTA.", "Some parents do parties for children more for themselves than their birthday boy/girl. If you and yours enjoy it, great. This dad isn't interested. To him, it's pointless. I also said he ought to give in. The clean-up comment was a joke.", "Just because kids don\u2019t remember doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t enjoy it or that the adults won\u2019t also enjoy it and be able to reminisce as he gets older. \n\nAlso, how do you know when the \u201cmemory\u201d switch turns on? Are you going to solely determine that for your child?\n\nThis makes me feel sorry for your son. I hope he doesn\u2019t remember what a shitty parent you are. YTA", "It doesn\u2019t matter if the child will remember (but 3-year-olds can remember). He\u2019ll have fun! You sound horribly controlling and like a huge wet blanket. What is all this about \u201ctelling\u201d her how it will be, or \u201cletting\u201d or \u201cnot letting\u201d her do whatever? You\u2019re the kind of poster that makes me seek out my husband specifically to thank him for not being a controlling prick. YTA.", "Yta, this party is more for the mom than the kid anyway. He might not remember, but she will remember every year she wasn't able to celebrate your child. She wants to have a party for her kid becoming older. There is no reason not to be supportive unless you just hate parties. And even then you can just suck it up for a day.", "What harm does it do to just celebrate it her way? It brings her joy. She wants to make memories for herself too, not just him. He may not remember it but he may look back fondly on pictures and videos. I don't understand why the need to argue so hard over a stupid party. If you said the issue was finances I'd get it but you just can't seem to find value in it so it's a hard stop? \n\nNot everything has to be about what you remember either.  People don't remember what happens when they get black out drunk but they still do it, don't they?\n\nETA judgement - YTA", "YTA. Not intentionally, but your mindset is completely wrong. Saying you shouldn't have a party for a 3 year old or kids 6 and under because they won't remember it doesn't make sense. Would you say it's pointless to take them to the zoo, or the park, or the circus at that age because they won't remember it? Not everything is about the accurate memory. They can still enjoy themselves and create short-term memories that will impact how they grow up. Having other kids there and being able to play party games and feel special for a day is something he'll enjoy and be able to remember for a while, maybe not when he's older (when he'll have videos), but that's not all that matters. And as parents, you can get him excited about it beforehand as well, telling him the party's coming up and how much fun he's going to have, and he can choose his own theme based on his interests. \n\nDevelopmentally there's a huge difference between a one year old, who would have the same amount of fun going to anyone else's party, and a 3 year old who understands it's their birthday and that you're celebrating them and can get excited over cake, games, presents and having fun with everyone at their party. Having a huge blowout party might not be necessary, but if your wife wants to do that and has the means, there's nothing wrong with that. Your son and everyone else will have a great time and she'll get the satisfaction that party planning brings her. Your kid shouldn't not have fun or feel special until he has long-term perfect recall. The experiences he has while he's 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 are what will form him as a person, even if he can't remember every second of it.", "Agreed with everyone else 100%. I also just want to add that I definitely have memories from before age 3 so OP\u2019s point about not remembering things doesn\u2019t even make sense. Sure they aren\u2019t in depth detailed memories but I definitely have bits and pieces still. It\u2019s also easier to remember things that were unique experiences than things that blended together. I very distinctly remember the house I lived in up until age 3. I remember drawing on walls, even doing gross toddler things like wiping my nose on the carpet, playing in the yard. I know these aren\u2019t false memories because I\u2019ve asked my parents about things in that house and they would say they fully forgot about it until I reminded them. People 100% can retain memories from before age 3.", "YTA. Those early years are so very special, and the memories are for everyone!", "YTA", "Soft YTA. \n\nI used to think this way too. When my first was younger I felt weird making a fuss about holidays and birthdays. Then I heard from a friend who had a child die suddenly say that yeah \u201cit might have been silly to have big celebrations for things their kid wasn\u2019t going to remember but the memories they had of those big parties and celebrations were all that we have left of our son.\u201d \n\nI know that\u2019s morbid and most likely your child will live a long and happy life but none of us think we are going to lose a child. Both my children are alive but we almost lost my oldest to a serious illness and still could. Trust me, celebrate things even things they might not remember. You, your gf, and your family need those memories just as much as they do.", "YTA as long as you all can afford it have a big party. You are literally being a party popper. Birthday parties are not the time to be pragmatic. It's not about whether he'll remember it it's about the joy that he gets the experience in the moment.", "YTA\n\nWhat does it hurt for her to have a big party for yalls kid? Unless it\u2019s gonna put y\u2019all in a crazy amount of debt or something just let her celebrate. And you celebrate and have fun too. It\u2019s okay to do it even if he won\u2019t remember. It\u2019s memories y\u2019all will have with him. Those are important too.", "Two things here - you aren\u2019t exactly wrong, but at the same time - she has been giving in to YOUR wants for two years, so you value your girlfriend? Do you want her to stay around? This is important to her. She is telling you it is important to her and ASKING YOU TO LISTEN TO HER.\n\nHave the party. Take the photos. And when your kid is a teenager and looks at the photos again, they\u2019re gonna be happy, even if they can\u2019t remember it.\n\nThe good news is you don\u2019t need to spring for a clown because you already have one.\n\nYTA", "YTA do you always do what you want and ignore her?", "YTA\n\nBirthday parties are not necessarily for the memory, they are for the moment. \n\nHe might not remember the decoration or the cake, but he will habe an exciting day with family and friends.\n\nWhile I think your argument of it being overwhelming, it doesn\u2019t mean you need to keep it completly small. Why don't you compromise on increasing party size every year and see how you and your son like it?", "YTA He won't remember my ass. One of my bosses kids learned how to do sign language before she could even talk. I think you just believe your kids too stupid to enjoy it", "YTA. You\u2019re not the only parent so your opinion on this isn\u2019t the only one that matters. You have a good point but so does your gf. Why do you get to be the only one who gets your way? Let her do a larger party this year and work with her to set a budget you\u2019re both comfortable with. Compromise is supposed to be a central part of a relationship.", "NAH-. I get your point.  That being said just because he won't remember the party doesn't mean it wouldn't have an impact on his development.  I don't remember many specific events before I was like 10 but I'm sure the things that happened made me the person I am today.  It's not like you're a lifeless blob until 6 and then suddenly become a fully developed person.", ">My mom says I should just do what my girlfriend says because Dad's word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.\n\nWTH?", "ESH\n\nHear my out please.\n\nI agree that a huge birthday party for a toddler is a waste, hence calling your GF an AH, but...\n\nYou say 6 or 7. Most people can recollect significant events at 4 or so. So next year, you should start having a bigger birthday party.\n\nOn top of that, why not have a few toddlers over for him to play with? Doesn't have to be huge, but you know maybe a few more people that just you, your GF and some grandparents. I can't help but feel that you are making excuses because you are down right anti-social. There is a middle ground here.", "NTA \nPiece of advice. Give in. It won't hurt anything except your wallet.  Cleaning up afterward may make her put any suggestion of another b-day party off for a few more years.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH, you\u2019ve celebrated your son\u2019s birthday the past 2 years the way that you wanted. She compromised on what she wanted to do and did what you wanted. You are not wrong for how you want to celebrate, your child will not remember, but where is the harm in letting her celebrate the way she wants? When are you going to compromise for her on this issue?", "A good guideline I've heard for children's birthday parties is to invite a number of children that's the same as the birthday child's age; that is, three child guests for a three-year-old, etc. When birthday parties get too big, the children just feel overwhelmed and don't have a good time anyway. I agree with your not wanting to make a big production of it. Also, adults don't really care about attending, unless they are close relatives or unless they are the parents of the child guests.", "I love how all the comments are about what the GF wants and how she deserves to get her way for once. Literally no one talking about what the kid would actually enjoy. Ultimately, if the kid can\u2019t enjoy much of the party in the moment, then the party is only thrown for the sake of the GF\u2019s vanity. You tell me how that is healthy? OP is right, the party is being thrown at the kid\u2019s expense and he is just being used as a prop. NTA\n\nP.S. Literally no one is talking about the comments made by the MIL. \u201cDad\u2019s word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.\u201d The collective judgement on this post reeks of gender bias. If the situation was flipped, no way would OP be an A H.\n\nP.P.S. To everyone acting like OP doesn\u2019t feel the need to make memories the kid won\u2019t remember, chill out. He still wants to celebrate the dang birthday, just not with a huge party!", "NTA\n\n  \nAnyway, I think you're going to get a lot of disagreement on here based on what kind of life style people want for their families.   \n\n\nPersonally, I think birthday parties for kids are stupid. They are expensive and a waste of time.   \n\n\nThat said, I guess the question is if this is the hill on which you want to die. Is this worth fighting with your GF and the mother of your child? This is one of those times where I agree with you, but compromise with your GF might be a better route.

My girlfriend liked to host parties, and when he reached his first birthday, she wanted to have a big birthday party, but I managed to convince her to massively downsize to just us, our parents and siblings, and just have some cake, little guy was still too young.\n\nThe next year she again talked about her plans to have a big party for our 2yo, but again I told her it would be just close family and a cake and a happy birthday song. \n\nThis year she told me about her plans and again I told her to just do something small, but this time she was frustrated and told me to let her do something bigger for our son for once. I explained that it is ridiculous to have such big parties for toddlers, they will not remember anything. For example, when I was 2, my family threw me a huge birthday party, the theme was Toy Story, which had just come out. I have no recollection of it, just some VHS tapes of me looking stupid in a Woody costume while the older kids had fun on their own.\n\nShe said it doesn't matter because there will be lots of people taking pictures and he can just see them when he gets older. I told her again that it would just be having fun at his expense, the little guy is a heavy sleeper who plays and runs for 30 minutes and then falls asleep on a sofa or a chair or his bed. \n\nShe still doesn't understand my point of view, it's not like he won't ever have a birthday party, we should just wait until he's like 6 or 7, you know, when he can actually remember.\n\nMy girlfriend is still mad at me and says she is going to plan a birthday party whether I like it or not. I tried talking to her mom to see if she could talk some sense into her, only to be verbally slammed by her, telling me I'm depriving my child of a childhood. My mom says I should just do what my girlfriend says because Dad's word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy over this.

As toddlers and younger don't have the language skills, their memories of that age are harder to retrieve, but they are still there.\n\nSo as adults we can't actively remember anything from that time of our lives, but the memories are atill there and influence our behaviour unconsciously.\n\nIs it hurting your child to not celebrate his birthday? No, I don't think so. Will celebrating his birthday (and with that knowing that he's loved and having positive, happy memories) be benificial to his development. Yes, I believe so!\n\nYTA, because celebrating our kid's birthday is not just for your kid, but also for all the people that love him and care about him. It makes your wife appy to celebrate, so why not?", "Dude! Kid parties aren\u2019t for the kids, they\u2019re for the parents and family. Let her have the party she wants! YTA.", "YTA, till the day he died my father talked about my first birthday party and how happy I was that day. \n\nDo I remember a single sencond of it? Absolutely not. But do you know what I do remember? How my dad\u2019s eyes lit up every time he brought it up, and how excited he\u2019d get to talk about how happy I was at the time. Make those memories with your kid.", "I like your girlfriend\nYou? Not so much\n\n\nBig YTA", "YTA, there are these magical things called pictures that capture special moments so you can share them with your child later. If you really want to get crazy, there\u2019s moving pictures called videos which you can also take with the little magic pocket computer called a phone. Let your partner have this, her and your child will be happy and enjoy their party.", "I have two kids and they absolutely love to go through old pictures of themselves. So while a 3 year old won\u2019t remember the big party, he will love to look back and see all his family celebrating him. And why deny your gf a party when she enjoys hosting them? YTA to your son and your gf.", "YTA - life is too short to delay celebrations. Celebrate whenever you can and a birthday is certainly something to celebrate. Let your wife have some fun", "YTA - why not put your son in a box till he is old enough to remember things? The heck is this mentality?", "YTA- the first 2 years you \u201ctold\u201d her that it would be small.\n\nThis year, she \u201ctold\u201d you that she wants to go bigger for fun, and you retaliated by running and telling BOTH of your moms on her, which didn\u2019t go well.  Now you\u2019re telling us.\n\nYTA no matter how many people you tell until someone agrees with you.", "YTA dude just tell her to throw the party but don't spend a lot ($300 or more depending on people and location)", "YTA Let the child\u2019s mother throw him a birthday party. Sheesh. It\u2019s once a year!", "YTA. I understand and agree that babies and young toddlers shouldn\u2019t be having extravagant things spent or done with them. However, two things:\n\n1) the party your wife wants isn\u2019t really for your son. It\u2019s for her. You may think it\u2019s silly but that\u2019s a closed minded viewpoint.\n\n2) the bigger issue is you are strong arming to get your way on multiple occasions. You \u201cmanaged to convince\u201d her to have it your way the first time, and the second time you told we her how it was going to be. Her feelings do not matter to you, and it is clear.", "YTA\n\nParties and trips and stuff like that with little kids is as much for the older loved ones if not more.\n\nYou (general) can always find reasons not to have a party. Just let her have fun.", "You had your way two years in a row, man, give her a turn to celebrate his birthday how she wants.\n\nAlso parties are for the whole family, not just the kid.", "According to your philosophy, nothing matters until a child will remember it. Yet, child development studies show B-3 is the most critical period of a person's life! YTA. Have a party.", "Dude just because he won't remember it someday doesn't mean he won't remember it now. It matters to your wife, so it should matter to you. My son just turned 4. We had a huge party for the first time for him (because covid) and he had a huge smile on his face the whole time. Totally worth it. YTA", "YTA. They are only kids for a little while and then grow up and make their own choices on how they spend their birthdays, which often doesn\u2019t include parents. Let your girlfriend celebrate her baby and make some memories that she will hold with her. Your arguments only serve to tarnish her memories of his birthday.", "YTA", "YTA, the way you're putting it, you're depriving a toddler of happiness and fun cause \"they won't remember it anyways\". that's dumb. Hell I probably won't remember my teens when I'm 95 or something so doesn't mean I'm not gonna have fun. Let your kid have a party", "1. The birthday party isn\u2019t for the baby, it is for HER, she\u2019s been raising a baby for three years! Let her entertain some guests!\n\n2. It\u2019s true they aren\u2019t making memories yet, but they ARE developing a personality even pre memories, so they need entertainment, attention and love.\n\nIt sounds like this is more about some weird hang ups you have about your own childhood than the actual party. It\u2019s been three years, let her have friends over so she doesn\u2019t have to talk about Bluey for once.", "OP is confused declarative memory with memory in general, they aren't the same thing. Procedural memory starts pretty well right away  Also, the hippocampus is well formed enough for declarative memories to form around 2ish. Early experiences before 2 play a large role in the child's development even if they can't recall the details. Have the party.", "My mom always said one through three parties is for the mom not the kid. And that\u2019s okay!", "The party is not for your kid. It's for your wife. She wants to have memories of fun times with her child. Let her have them.", "YTA- for all the reasons covered", "YTA. Why? You\u2019re being way too in your head about this and disregarding your gf\u2019s feelings. She\u2019s his parent, too. The party is to make your gf happy. Can\u2019t you see how important this is to her? Don\u2019t you want her to be happy and excited to share your child\u2019s milestone and have pictures to look back on? Besides, it\u2019s not necessarily true that he won\u2019t remember. I have memories (few, but very clear) from when I was three years old. I have those memories because someone who loved me took the time to make them.", "YTA I remember my third birthday perfectly and even remember the bike I got.", "YTA.. You are denying your girlfriend the chance to celebrate her child. So If yess you won't take him to the zoo or the fair or anything else because he is too young to appreciate it? We did lots of things before my children could remember them (including a trip to Disney) but they love sharing the stories and seeing the pictures. But also, I love having those memories. I love having the joy of doing things with my kids.", "YTA. Why should your opinion about this matter more than his mother's? You had your way for two years. That's enough.", "YTA - your 3 yr old won't remember it, but everyone else will remember seeing the joy on the kids face when they experience a party in their honour.\n\nStop being such a sour-puss", "Yep. First party I remember is my third party. My fourth was usurped by my mum going into labour. Give the boy a party.", "yta- also he might remember some parts of it! i remember very vague memories from my early birthdays and im very glad to have them", "Well, your mom is an AH for the \"Dad's word is not that important and I should know my place as a father\" BS, but yes, YTA. You're kid won't remember any of the fun stuff you do with him now but I'm sure you *still* do fun stuff with him now. Also, you're saying *your gf doesn't deserve to celebrate her child*. Early birthday parties are just as much for the parents as for the children. Your gf deserves the chance to celebrate how she sees fit, why do you get the veto power, she's the parent too. You're being incredibly controlling about this, look in the mirror and figure out why you need to control your gf.", "Yeah I don't get the whole big party for a baby with lots of adults but on the other hand--party?  OKAY  CAKE???   Even better!", "*My mom says I should just do what my girlfriend says because Dad's word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.*\n\nWell to me it sounds like you've gotten your way for the last several years but you're complaining you're not getting your way *again*. Now that's weaponized pity. And no one needs to \"talk sense\" into your wife because her way is just as valid as yours. You got great parties as a kid and you don't think your child should have the same because why? Even if he doesn't remember it he can look at the pictures and the videos and know he was well loved. YTA", "> Dad's word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.\n\nSeriously???  From your own mother?  NTA but I worry about the women in your life.\n\nWhat you have here are a mother and two grandmothers who desperately want to display their son/grandson before anyone and everyone they can invite/bribe/coerce into showing up at an event designed to showcase their precious angel.  They will not accept the logic that the child will remember a party better when they have friends their own age to anticipate it with, share it with, and talk about it together after the fact.  Nope, it's all about the maternal ones.\n\nYou have two choices:  Give in gracefully and get out of their way or ignore them and go fishing that day.  Do not, under any circumstances, leave the house with your son prior to the event to 'save him' from their foolishness - you'd probably end up charged with kidnapping!", "OP, YTA.\n\nAnd you go run to mommy like a tattletale so she could fight this battle for you.\n\nGrow up. Then, get over yourself.  Why can't a party happen even if your child won't remember?", "Bruh, if you wanna keep your gf you gotta learn to compromise. You both got your opinions and reasons. For the last two years she's been giving up what she wants so you can have your way.  If you can't compromise even 1/3 of the time then you really shouldn't have had kids.  Kids are going to drive you crazy with their crazy wants and if you're rigidly unbending over every little thing you're going to lose them.", "YTA. You\u2019re a selfish controlling dictatorial AH.", "YTA. First of all let me say that your mother is wrong your opinion as a father does matter it's just that this opinion is a pretty stupid one. Do you just not want to do any fun things with your son until he can remember it cause that sounds shit IMO.", "There is a picture of me in a tutu with a princess hat on and olives on my thumbs at my 3rd birthday. The picture is framed on my fathers desk. Most fathers delight in seeing their children joyful and being celebrated by friends and family. You\u2019re allowed to enjoy your children! Yta", "In just a few more years you won't remember much either. So stop enjoying your life, it's obviously just a waste of time and money.\n\nYta", "Your 3 year old only plays for half an hour before he falls asleep? Huh? Have you told the doctor? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s typical.", "YTA. I share your same logic, but I know it makes me an AH so I'm not having kids lol. Your girlfriend held back for 2 years, now she gets to plan a fun party, even if it's mostly the older folks that will get the most enjoyment out of it.", "YTA I\u2019ve got a 3 year old. I haven\u2019t thrown her a party yet, but she\u2019s having one for her 4th. I understand why you feel this way. But the party isn\u2019t just about your child. It\u2019s a celebration for your girlfriend too. Why are you denying her experiences that are important to her as a mother?", "YTA", "100% agree on this. How we interact with our children now shapes them. \n\nWe show them love, cuddle them, play with them, also discipline them and show them boundaries and we should celebrate them also. \n\nMy daughter loved her 3rd birthday party. I don't know if she'll remember it or not, but I know it made her happy and special, and why shouldn't she?!\n\nAlso, as an aside, I do have memories of being 3 so his kid actually might remember this! \n\nRegardless, it will shape the adult she becomes. \n\nAlso, why is it OP telling his OH. She has as much say as he does. YTA OP.", "I agree with everything you said.\n\nOP- It\u2019s also important to remember that your girlfriend has memories and you\u2019re ruining these important moments for her. She should be able to celebrate her child and not take a single photo or video of the day and live with those beautiful memories forever.", "I was going to respond to OP with the same thing but you nailed it far better than I would have. OP, YTA!", "Thank you for expressing what children need, whether they remember later or not.", "Exactly. OP is doing a lot of **telling** instead of discussing, and seems to think that his word is final. It's not. \n\nLike you said, OP got his way for two years. The child's mom can have a party if she wants to.", "Exactly. Also, a party is a celebration that everyone gets to share and enjoy. GF clearly enjoys throwing big parties, why not let her do that?  Why insist on being a kill joy?  If this is how OP approaches parenting the lack of compromise is alarming. YTA", "I also totally remember my 3rd birthday party.", "I know parents who threw big one-year-old parties, not so much for the child, but to celebrate having made it through baby\u2019s first year.", "excellent points !", "This. I can understand not wanting a large party the first year, and maybe even the second. It doesn't matter that your son won't remember it. He will still enjoy it. \n\nAlso, why is your decision always the final say? You're in a relationship with someone who cares enough about your son to help throw him a party - why not appreciate her and indulge them both?\n\nThe fact that you went to both of your mothers is ridiculous. Although, your mother minimizing your importance as a father isn't cool. Learn to work these things out with your girlfriend and compromise. \n\nYTA", "Right? Usually a kiddo's first birthday parties are for the parents to treasure.\n\nPlus, can you imagine the child growing up and seeing that they had no birthday celebrations for 6 years? While I have no memories of my 1st birthday, it still warms my heart to see the happy photos and my parents' excitement back then.", "Very telling that OP's version of the story of his 2nd birthday was him \"looking stupid\" while older kids \"had fun on their own\". And that throwing a party for a 3 year old is \"having fun at his expense\" since he'd be tired after half an hour. I guess it would be wrong to throw a party in case other people have fun at it, & everyone else is crazy for thinking otherwise", "I find it funny that he thought grandma would be anti-party for her grandchild. Honestly, parties are as much for the family and friends who love and want to celebrate (and spoil a little) the child as much as it is for the birthday kid. Unbridled joy from little ones are some of life\u2019s greatest moments, whether they remember them or not.", "Yeah, that statement got me too... I'm surprised I had to scroll so far to see it.", "Yes, I totally think so too! Between the kid having no energy (possible health problems) & the cringey comment his mom made (possible shitty childhood) I think for sure there's a reason.", "Yeah, my thoughts, too. Most 3 year olds I've interacted with have had crazy energy.", "But he literally said he just wants a smaller party, not something big & crazy... How is that different?", "On the flip side, I have like two memories from before I was 14 -likely partially to aphantasia (no visual imagination, so all my memories are lists of events and very rarely sounds, doesn't seem to stick that well). Nobody is going to argue that a child's 10th birthday party won't matter though, for example- I'm a more-or-less functioning adult, but most people my age feel this way so I seem to be doing fine. Just because I can't remember a majority of my life doesn't mean it didn't shape me.", ">Also, as an aside, I do have memories of being 3 so his kid actually might remember this! \n\nExactly! My earliest memory is from when my brother was born. I was 2 years 6 months and 2 days old. Actually, I *think* I remember the cake I had at my 2nd birthday, but I could be remembering seeing it in pictures later. \n\nAnd I definitely have a *lot* of memories from before I was *6 or 7*!!!  I was in 2nd grade when I turned 7. I would be in trouble if I didn't have memories from before that day.\n\nStory of my earliest memory because I kind of love it:\n\nSo my brother was born on Easter Sunday and I came up to the hospital with my grandparents. (I think. I'm pretty sure people were swapping places between being home with me and at the hospital with my mom, I don't remember who brought me.) I brought some of my Easter candy with me, and when my mom came out to say hi to me (since I couldn't go back in the ward being so young), I gave her a mini chocolate egg. Except I decided I had to test it for her first to make sure it was okay, so I unwrapped it, pooped it in my mouth and sucked on it for a few seconds, then took it out and gave it to her. And, bless her, she thanked me and ate it. The part that's clear (the candy thing) is maybe a minute of the day at most, but I definitely remember.", "He didn't like his wife telling ***him*** though... to the point he tries to tell on her to her mommy. YTA OP.", "Right? And I even agree with OP that the first few birthdays are more for the parents than the kids... so let her have a dang party if she wants to!", "My daughter loved hers, and she still remembers it now and talks about it. \n\nShe might not remember when she is older, but it will hopefully contribute towards a happy childhood and shape the person she becomes.", "My 3rd birthday is the first that I remember; and I just turned 60.", "Actually, I'm with the naysayers on this one.  If I forked out for a nice vacation I hope one of the grandparents are down to babysit.  For the birthday I could go either way and if your wife wants a big party let her do it.", "I believe the Inuit didn't celebrate the birth of a child until their 1st birthday.  The infant mortality rate was so high they waited until the 1st birthday because then they knew the child had a pretty good chance of survival.", "I don\u2019t get that, \u201chaving fun at his expense\u201d? Like other people having fun is a bad thing?", "It sounds great! Not the first time I've been known to be wrong, LOL.", "I didn\u2019t expand on the point here I guess \u2014 the mom wants a bigger party and the kid is going to have fun. So who cares they won\u2019t remember?", "> And I definitely have a lot of memories from before I was 6 or 7!!! I was in 2nd grade when I turned 7. I would be in trouble if I didn't have memories from before that day.\n\nSeriously, drawing that line at 6 is *insane* to me. Maybe some people don't retain long term memories until then, but that's atypically late for a first memory.\n\nI mean, I'm 100% behind this theory if you're talking about something like a baby's first christmas where it's almost 100% about the adults, but a 3 year old is entirely old enough to get what is going on.", "\ud83d\ude01", "Do you remember it?

Not a continuous event but he remembers when his Grandma had an old van and where \"his\" seat was (the van was totaled when he was 2). He remembers a few parks they went to before the were tore down, he remembers the apartment him and his parents lived in before they moved into their final house. All things before he was 3 yrs old. Is it perfect memory? No but he has those memories. I'm sure he has splices of his birthday memories too.\n\nAnd on the flip side of that, I have no memories from before I was 10... unless I was shown photos and told stories about it- and those aren't really \"my\" memories. And after that, it's bits and pieces of what I remember.", "I hear you... I feel like this is either a financial concern, concern for the kids health that they haven't fully given us info on or maybe even triggering for them...\n\nI don't think OPS the AH for not wanting a large party but they need to learn to communicate WHY & also, contacting both moms is a bit pathetic...", "Same. I\u2019m on vacation with my 6 week old right now. My parents and my husband I will absolutely remember seeing her little face and her tiny swimsuit, and going on beach walks with her."]}
