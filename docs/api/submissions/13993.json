My girlfriend liked to host parties, and when he reached his first birthday, she wanted to have a big birthday party, but I managed to convince her to massively downsize to just us, our parents and siblings, and just have some cake, little guy was still too young.\n\nThe next year she again talked about her plans to have a big party for our 2yo, but again I told her it would be just close family and a cake and a happy birthday song. \n\nThis year she told me about her plans and again I told her to just do something small, but this time she was frustrated and told me to let her do something bigger for our son for once. I explained that it is ridiculous to have such big parties for toddlers, they will not remember anything. For example, when I was 2, my family threw me a huge birthday party, the theme was Toy Story, which had just come out. I have no recollection of it, just some VHS tapes of me looking stupid in a Woody costume while the older kids had fun on their own.\n\nShe said it doesn't matter because there will be lots of people taking pictures and he can just see them when he gets older. I told her again that it would just be having fun at his expense, the little guy is a heavy sleeper who plays and runs for 30 minutes and then falls asleep on a sofa or a chair or his bed. \n\nShe still doesn't understand my point of view, it's not like he won't ever have a birthday party, we should just wait until he's like 6 or 7, you know, when he can actually remember.\n\nMy girlfriend is still mad at me and says she is going to plan a birthday party whether I like it or not. I tried talking to her mom to see if she could talk some sense into her, only to be verbally slammed by her, telling me I'm depriving my child of a childhood. My mom says I should just do what my girlfriend says because Dad's word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy over this.

You don't remember your Toy Story bday, but your parents probably do. Maybe they don't look back on the videos now, but they may have when you were 5 or 6, or hell my mom told me when I went to college her and my dad sat down and watched all of my VHS even though they never did. She told me that to implore me to take every video/picture I possibly could of my kid and to save them. \n\nYou've poo-poo'd your GF desires for 2 years. She gets this.\n\nIt would be one thing if she was asking you to do a million things. She just wants to do what gives her joy for her child. Not only should you have already backed off, you certainly should not have tried to rally family/friends against her.", "YTA.  You got your way for two years - if she likes planning events like these, you should not take it away from her. Some day you might regret not having those cute pictures to share.  For now, you kind of just sound like you are close minded to what **she** wants to do for **her** child.  And, going behind her back to talk to her mom (to try to get your way) is a real jerk move.", "So you shouldn\u2019t do anything fun with your kids until they\u2019re old enough to remember? Why bring them to the park? Why read them books? Why watch movies with them? Why do anything fun at all until they can have a memory of it? \nDo you see how stupid that sounds? \nYTA", "YTA\n\nWhy is it always your way, and never hers? You got your level of party the first two years, why can't she celebrate her child how she wants to this year \n\n\n\nBut on larger issue, you really need to examine why you think that your child's experiences don't matter unless he can remember them. Like, he still experiences those moments and it helps shape who his is whether he remembers it when he's 30 or not.\n\nHe won't remember being snuggled and hugged as a newborn, but it mattered to him in the moment, and taught him that you were a source of comfort and security\n\nHe won't remember his first trip to the park or the zoo, but it mattered to him in the moment and taught him the joys of exploring new places.\n\nHe won't remember all the times you comforted him when he hurt himself and cried as he hurt himself learning to walk and run, but it mattered on the moment and taught him that he can come to you when life gets hard.\n\n\nIf nothing matters before age 6 because he won't remember anything, might as well ship him off to an orphanage until then right? Cause he won't remember and it's the same as him not experiencing any of his first six years? \n\nLet him have that day to feel loved and special and celebrated.", "YTA for sure. You're depriving everyone involved of a good time for pretty much no reason. He may not remember the party in 20 years, but he'll have a good time in the moment, and you can take pictures and videos for yourselves and him to look back on. By your logic, you should never do anything fun with him because he won't remember", "YTA. You wife is trying to build memories for your family, you already deny it two times and you find that stupid, may be you don't remember your Toy Story birthday, but your parents do. Birthday is a good occasion for family time, to have all the kids having fun, to spend time with your family and to build memories.", "YTA. She wants memories you callous dork.", "Omg YTA do you deprive him of all fun and joy because he won't be able to reminisce about it later? \n\nDo you make her leave him at home when you go to the beach or the park because it's not worth it unless it becomes a core memory? \n\nPeople don't give parties for babies because they don't know wtf a party is. If you've ever spent time around a three year old, you'd very much understand what having a big celebration would mean to them.\n\nMy daughter picked the theme and decorations for her third birthday. She's 6 now and still talks about her first party fondly.\n\nNot to mention, this is obviously something that would bring your wife a lot of happiness. Does that in itself not make it worth it? Your opinion isn't the only one that matters, especially if it's based off of arbitrary assumptions of when your kid will start forming long lasting memories. \n\nYTA and a joyless tyrant.", "Massive YTA\n\nYour girlfriend is right. Let her organise something for the poor little kid. The fact that you don't looking back at those pictures doesn't mean that he won't look back at these parties. You're being unreasonable and the fact that you told her no twice and you're doing it again for something that *she* wants to do for her son is not compromising at all. You're just shoving what you think is right onto her.\n\nThis is a relationship. Compromises are necessary.", "YTA. The birthday isn't just about whether he'll remember it. It's about celebrating him with those close to you. You'll have pics & video and hopefully good memories to look back on. I know now it is hard to see much into the future but believe me the years will pass by faster than you realize. When you get older you're going to wish you had more pics of him at this age.", "YTA.  Sounds she you got what YOU wanted for the first two bdays, but you want 3/3 to be your way because that's the way YOU see it.  Childrens bday parties are to also celebrate the child together with family and friends.  You owe a compromise here.", "YTA. Let her have the party. But push it's a get together cake and good times few gifts. At 3 the kid doesn't need a bunch of gifts he won't remember in a week. By 4 and 5 you do remember. At 4 I remember a steel bank that was welded together painted blue. Don't have a clue what happened to it.", "YTA.  I HATE when people say the child \u201cwon\u2019t remember it\u201d.  Does it matter, or is it if he has fun?  Yes, he can do other things to have fun, but as long as he could enjoy it who cares!  And it shouldn\u2019t be what you will \u201callow\u201d.  If you guys can\u2019t afford it or another logical reason to not throw a huge party I get that, but just because you \u201csay so\u201d?  Go somewhere else with that.", "YTA. Yes, I agree that a 3-year old kid probably won't care about a huge party. Your gf clearly does though, and she already gave in the past two years. Just let she have it the way she wants this time.\n\nAlso you're acting like you're the one person who has seen the truth about life when you say things like \"she still doesn't understand my point of view\" (yeah, it's clearly you who understand hers, having things your way twice already and being so annoyed when it might be the other way) and \"I tried talking to her mom to see if she could talk some sense into her\" (because you're clearly right about everything and people not following your view are not in their right minds).", "YTA. You're technically correct in all your statements, but you're missing the point. A funeral is also useless by your metrics, as the deceased cannot experience it. Events like this are for the memories you can form as parents, not for the kid.", "YTA\u2026 plus you complained to her mom?? Really?? Grow up.", "YTA. A huge party? (By which I mean like over 20 people) No. But why not some of his friends and their parents?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be fancy or extravagant. Fruit and veg platter. Cupcakes. Pizza. Some streamers. \n\nYour son may not remember the party (and he might! My 4yo remembers her third), but your gf will. You will. These parties are also for her, to celebrate these early years when the wonder of a cake and candles is still new. When he\u2019ll still let you put the hat on his head. When he might want a little help opening the wrapping paper. \n\n(Now, I love themed parties. I do fun homemade themes and puns every year. It has been worth the work every dang time.) \n\nBy your logic you also shouldn\u2019t do Christmas. Or Easter or Canada Day barbecues or Hannukah. Oh wait - those days are for the whole family to celebrate\u2026\u2026just like his birthday.", "YTA\n\nThe party isn't just for the kid.  It's for the family to  celebrate you and the kid.\n\nDo you have the same feelings about anniversaries?  \"Honey, 1st anniversary is just the paper anniversary.  Let's at least wait until the Iron  Anniversary.  That has meaning AND heft.\"\n\nGood luck!", "YTA \n\nYour partner wants to throw your child a birthday party. And you said no.... Wow.", "YTA. \n\nShe did it your way for two years. It\u2019s time she gets to do it her way. You know - the whole concept of compromise.\n\nIt seems like you\u2019re weirdly angry about your childhood birthday party. Kids aren\u2019t supposed to look sophisticated. They\u2019re supposed to have fun and be silly. They have a blast regardless whether it becomes a core memory.\n\nStop being unilateral in your decision making.\n\n(As an aside - your Mom is an AH too for what she said. The point is that dad and mom *equally* matter. And here we are back to compromise.)", "[removed]", "YTA \n\nSo you have convinced her two times already to not do what she clearly wants (which is a big party for her son). In what way will it hurt you or your son that she gets her way this time? Do you know the meaning of the word compromise?", "YTA. Huge AH!!! Just because they won't remember it, YOU will. Loved ones will. And he will get to see the \"memories\". Your way is not the only way. There has to be some compromise and she did for TWO YEARS. The only way you wouldn't be an AH is if you couldn't afford it. Calm down and let her plan something for your son. Sheesh.", "YTA, idk about you but I have vague memories of when I was around that age.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s a chance for friends and family to get together and spoil your son for the day, and celebrate his existence. Yeah, he might not remember it with perfect clarity, but he\u2019ll almost certainly enjoy it.\n\nIt\u2019s good to let your child experience these larger types of gatherings too. Gets them used to being in a room with a lot of people. \n\nAnd finally, if your gf REALLY wants to do it, why deprive her of it? She wants to do something nice for your son and she will clearly enjoy the planning too. I know you\u2019ve kinda fucked up already, but a really easy way to get back in her good graces would be to apologise and buy some decorations for the party. \n\nCmon, you have a son together and need to spend the rest of your lives with each other. Just get onboard with the party and who knows, you might even enjoy it?", "This is bizarre and YTA.  When my kids were 3, we had parties and invited their friends from daycare, and everybody had a good time.  Is it really because he won't remember it or is there another reason like money?", "YTA. \n\nLook, I get not wanting to throw a massive party EVERY year because that gets expensive. And I know the child isn\u2019t going to remember these parties. I think the first birthday of mine I remember was my 5th, and only a small part of it. \n\nBut parties at this age are really more for you guys as parents and other close adult family members. You come together to make it special and you take photos and videos that will be treasured for years to come. Your child will love looking back on the footage and hearing stories of the day. Consider that some older family members may not always be around to celebrate \u2014 these milestones are precious. I think it\u2019s sad you look back at your Toy Story party and think it to be silly instead of finding it joyous and appreciating the effort your family put into that. \n\nLastly\u2026 if your big reason to not have a proper party is that he won\u2019t remember it\u2026 then why do we bother doing anything with small children? Don\u2019t bother showing them your favourite childhood movies at this age, they won\u2019t remember. Don\u2019t go on any fun days out or to play outside, they won\u2019t remember. Ridiculous logic. \n\nApologise to your partner and love your child better.", "Yes YTA.  You, your gf and all the family will remember your son having a great time even if he doesn't remember.  Not sure why you are picking this hill to die on but you got your way the last two years, consider that a win.", "YTA - Have you never heard of compromising?  You got your way 2 years and you can't even give her 1. I cherish the photos of me with grandparents, great grandparents at my parties who died too young.\n\nPS.  Kids remember things before 6-7.  Usually 3 and up.", "I\u2019m 42 and I still remember my second birthday and every childhood birthday after that (and no, nobody took pictures I just remember and I know it was my second birthday because I also remember what I got as a gift). Now I know that\u2019s unusual, people say you don\u2019t have memories from early childhood once you become an adult but it was my daughters sixth birthday a few weeks ago and she suddenly asked me if it would be the same as the birthday when she came home and I had decorated everything and baked a cake. That was her third birthday. So even if he won\u2019t remember it when he\u2019s an adult he might still remember his third birthday a couple of years from now. Make it one to remember!", "Gentle YTA\n\nIt's about making memories. Not JUST for your child but for you as a family. And that may not mean much to you, but it clearly does to her.\n\nAs long as it's not too major of an expense for your budget, why not let her have that? And even if your child won't remember it later, that doesn't mean he won't enjoy it now.", "YTA for \u201cI told her\u201d alone. You do not get to make her decisions for her. If she wants to throw a party, she can.", "I understand your feelings. you are right that he won't remember. the party is not actually for him; i think that's what you are missing. No, it wouldn't be depriving him of his childhood LOL. It's depriving your gf and others from celebrating him at a party, even though he won't know or remember.", "Huge YTA. Why do you just not like your kid?", "YTA\n\nSometimes things aren't just so your kid will remember it - it's memories being made for you and her too. Also, I remember my 3rd birthday and I'm in my 30s now. So its very possible he might remember it too", "Yes huge YTA. God you sound awful! Your girlfriend is excited to celebrate your child and you are arguing with her about that?? Why did you even have a kid??", "Yta she's done your small parties then first 2 times.  At this age the parties are *for the adults*.  No, the kid won't remember but his mother will.\n\nShe absolutely understand your piont of view, she just, dun dun duuuuuuuun, doesn't agree!  Stop being a wet blanket.", "Toddler birthday parties are an excuse to get together with loved ones. No one expects the kiddo to remember it, it\u2019s about creating a joyful experience and spending time with friends and family. \n\nThe fact that you have been unilaterally deciding and dictating to your wife what kind of birthday party your kid is allowed to have makes you an AH. YTA.", "Some parents do parties for children more for themselves than their birthday boy/girl. If you and yours enjoy it, great. This dad isn't interested. To him, it's pointless. I also said he ought to give in. The clean-up comment was a joke.", "Just because kids don\u2019t remember doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t enjoy it or that the adults won\u2019t also enjoy it and be able to reminisce as he gets older. \n\nAlso, how do you know when the \u201cmemory\u201d switch turns on? Are you going to solely determine that for your child?\n\nThis makes me feel sorry for your son. I hope he doesn\u2019t remember what a shitty parent you are. YTA", "It doesn\u2019t matter if the child will remember (but 3-year-olds can remember). He\u2019ll have fun! You sound horribly controlling and like a huge wet blanket. What is all this about \u201ctelling\u201d her how it will be, or \u201cletting\u201d or \u201cnot letting\u201d her do whatever? You\u2019re the kind of poster that makes me seek out my husband specifically to thank him for not being a controlling prick. YTA.", "Yta, this party is more for the mom than the kid anyway. He might not remember, but she will remember every year she wasn't able to celebrate your child. She wants to have a party for her kid becoming older. There is no reason not to be supportive unless you just hate parties. And even then you can just suck it up for a day.", "What harm does it do to just celebrate it her way? It brings her joy. She wants to make memories for herself too, not just him. He may not remember it but he may look back fondly on pictures and videos. I don't understand why the need to argue so hard over a stupid party. If you said the issue was finances I'd get it but you just can't seem to find value in it so it's a hard stop? \n\nNot everything has to be about what you remember either.  People don't remember what happens when they get black out drunk but they still do it, don't they?\n\nETA judgement - YTA", "YTA. Not intentionally, but your mindset is completely wrong. Saying you shouldn't have a party for a 3 year old or kids 6 and under because they won't remember it doesn't make sense. Would you say it's pointless to take them to the zoo, or the park, or the circus at that age because they won't remember it? Not everything is about the accurate memory. They can still enjoy themselves and create short-term memories that will impact how they grow up. Having other kids there and being able to play party games and feel special for a day is something he'll enjoy and be able to remember for a while, maybe not when he's older (when he'll have videos), but that's not all that matters. And as parents, you can get him excited about it beforehand as well, telling him the party's coming up and how much fun he's going to have, and he can choose his own theme based on his interests. \n\nDevelopmentally there's a huge difference between a one year old, who would have the same amount of fun going to anyone else's party, and a 3 year old who understands it's their birthday and that you're celebrating them and can get excited over cake, games, presents and having fun with everyone at their party. Having a huge blowout party might not be necessary, but if your wife wants to do that and has the means, there's nothing wrong with that. Your son and everyone else will have a great time and she'll get the satisfaction that party planning brings her. Your kid shouldn't not have fun or feel special until he has long-term perfect recall. The experiences he has while he's 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 are what will form him as a person, even if he can't remember every second of it.", "Agreed with everyone else 100%. I also just want to add that I definitely have memories from before age 3 so OP\u2019s point about not remembering things doesn\u2019t even make sense. Sure they aren\u2019t in depth detailed memories but I definitely have bits and pieces still. It\u2019s also easier to remember things that were unique experiences than things that blended together. I very distinctly remember the house I lived in up until age 3. I remember drawing on walls, even doing gross toddler things like wiping my nose on the carpet, playing in the yard. I know these aren\u2019t false memories because I\u2019ve asked my parents about things in that house and they would say they fully forgot about it until I reminded them. People 100% can retain memories from before age 3.", "YTA. Those early years are so very special, and the memories are for everyone!", "YTA", "Soft YTA. \n\nI used to think this way too. When my first was younger I felt weird making a fuss about holidays and birthdays. Then I heard from a friend who had a child die suddenly say that yeah \u201cit might have been silly to have big celebrations for things their kid wasn\u2019t going to remember but the memories they had of those big parties and celebrations were all that we have left of our son.\u201d \n\nI know that\u2019s morbid and most likely your child will live a long and happy life but none of us think we are going to lose a child. Both my children are alive but we almost lost my oldest to a serious illness and still could. Trust me, celebrate things even things they might not remember. You, your gf, and your family need those memories just as much as they do.", "YTA as long as you all can afford it have a big party. You are literally being a party popper. Birthday parties are not the time to be pragmatic. It's not about whether he'll remember it it's about the joy that he gets the experience in the moment.", "YTA\n\nWhat does it hurt for her to have a big party for yalls kid? Unless it\u2019s gonna put y\u2019all in a crazy amount of debt or something just let her celebrate. And you celebrate and have fun too. It\u2019s okay to do it even if he won\u2019t remember. It\u2019s memories y\u2019all will have with him. Those are important too.", "Two things here - you aren\u2019t exactly wrong, but at the same time - she has been giving in to YOUR wants for two years, so you value your girlfriend? Do you want her to stay around? This is important to her. She is telling you it is important to her and ASKING YOU TO LISTEN TO HER.\n\nHave the party. Take the photos. And when your kid is a teenager and looks at the photos again, they\u2019re gonna be happy, even if they can\u2019t remember it.\n\nThe good news is you don\u2019t need to spring for a clown because you already have one.\n\nYTA", "YTA do you always do what you want and ignore her?", "YTA\n\nBirthday parties are not necessarily for the memory, they are for the moment. \n\nHe might not remember the decoration or the cake, but he will habe an exciting day with family and friends.\n\nWhile I think your argument of it being overwhelming, it doesn\u2019t mean you need to keep it completly small. Why don't you compromise on increasing party size every year and see how you and your son like it?", "YTA He won't remember my ass. One of my bosses kids learned how to do sign language before she could even talk. I think you just believe your kids too stupid to enjoy it", "YTA. You\u2019re not the only parent so your opinion on this isn\u2019t the only one that matters. You have a good point but so does your gf. Why do you get to be the only one who gets your way? Let her do a larger party this year and work with her to set a budget you\u2019re both comfortable with. Compromise is supposed to be a central part of a relationship.", "NAH-. I get your point.  That being said just because he won't remember the party doesn't mean it wouldn't have an impact on his development.  I don't remember many specific events before I was like 10 but I'm sure the things that happened made me the person I am today.  It's not like you're a lifeless blob until 6 and then suddenly become a fully developed person.", ">My mom says I should just do what my girlfriend says because Dad's word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.\n\nWTH?", "ESH\n\nHear my out please.\n\nI agree that a huge birthday party for a toddler is a waste, hence calling your GF an AH, but...\n\nYou say 6 or 7. Most people can recollect significant events at 4 or so. So next year, you should start having a bigger birthday party.\n\nOn top of that, why not have a few toddlers over for him to play with? Doesn't have to be huge, but you know maybe a few more people that just you, your GF and some grandparents. I can't help but feel that you are making excuses because you are down right anti-social. There is a middle ground here.", "NTA \nPiece of advice. Give in. It won't hurt anything except your wallet.  Cleaning up afterward may make her put any suggestion of another b-day party off for a few more years.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH, you\u2019ve celebrated your son\u2019s birthday the past 2 years the way that you wanted. She compromised on what she wanted to do and did what you wanted. You are not wrong for how you want to celebrate, your child will not remember, but where is the harm in letting her celebrate the way she wants? When are you going to compromise for her on this issue?", "A good guideline I've heard for children's birthday parties is to invite a number of children that's the same as the birthday child's age; that is, three child guests for a three-year-old, etc. When birthday parties get too big, the children just feel overwhelmed and don't have a good time anyway. I agree with your not wanting to make a big production of it. Also, adults don't really care about attending, unless they are close relatives or unless they are the parents of the child guests.", "I love how all the comments are about what the GF wants and how she deserves to get her way for once. Literally no one talking about what the kid would actually enjoy. Ultimately, if the kid can\u2019t enjoy much of the party in the moment, then the party is only thrown for the sake of the GF\u2019s vanity. You tell me how that is healthy? OP is right, the party is being thrown at the kid\u2019s expense and he is just being used as a prop. NTA\n\nP.S. Literally no one is talking about the comments made by the MIL. \u201cDad\u2019s word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.\u201d The collective judgement on this post reeks of gender bias. If the situation was flipped, no way would OP be an A H.\n\nP.P.S. To everyone acting like OP doesn\u2019t feel the need to make memories the kid won\u2019t remember, chill out. He still wants to celebrate the dang birthday, just not with a huge party!", "NTA\n\n  \nAnyway, I think you're going to get a lot of disagreement on here based on what kind of life style people want for their families.   \n\n\nPersonally, I think birthday parties for kids are stupid. They are expensive and a waste of time.   \n\n\nThat said, I guess the question is if this is the hill on which you want to die. Is this worth fighting with your GF and the mother of your child? This is one of those times where I agree with you, but compromise with your GF might be a better route.

My girlfriend liked to host parties, and when he reached his first birthday, she wanted to have a big birthday party, but I managed to convince her to massively downsize to just us, our parents and siblings, and just have some cake, little guy was still too young.\n\nThe next year she again talked about her plans to have a big party for our 2yo, but again I told her it would be just close family and a cake and a happy birthday song. \n\nThis year she told me about her plans and again I told her to just do something small, but this time she was frustrated and told me to let her do something bigger for our son for once. I explained that it is ridiculous to have such big parties for toddlers, they will not remember anything. For example, when I was 2, my family threw me a huge birthday party, the theme was Toy Story, which had just come out. I have no recollection of it, just some VHS tapes of me looking stupid in a Woody costume while the older kids had fun on their own.\n\nShe said it doesn't matter because there will be lots of people taking pictures and he can just see them when he gets older. I told her again that it would just be having fun at his expense, the little guy is a heavy sleeper who plays and runs for 30 minutes and then falls asleep on a sofa or a chair or his bed. \n\nShe still doesn't understand my point of view, it's not like he won't ever have a birthday party, we should just wait until he's like 6 or 7, you know, when he can actually remember.\n\nMy girlfriend is still mad at me and says she is going to plan a birthday party whether I like it or not. I tried talking to her mom to see if she could talk some sense into her, only to be verbally slammed by her, telling me I'm depriving my child of a childhood. My mom says I should just do what my girlfriend says because Dad's word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy over this.

As toddlers and younger don't have the language skills, their memories of that age are harder to retrieve, but they are still there.\n\nSo as adults we can't actively remember anything from that time of our lives, but the memories are atill there and influence our behaviour unconsciously.\n\nIs it hurting your child to not celebrate his birthday?

A couple hours of time?\n\nWhy doesn't your wife her to celebrate her child?\n\nWhy do you see yourself as superior to your wife?\n\nI think this is not the hill to die on and your energy would be better utilized showing love and affection to your three year old, even if he's not going to have a perfect frame by frame  photographic memory of it\n\nYTA x 1000000000", "YTA\n\nYeah it can be on paper a party for your kid, but even if they won\u2019t remember it.

But that's something we've all agreed on.", "YTA and your logic isn\u2019t logical.", "YTA. Let her enjoy celebrating his birthday. She made the kid, she should be allowed to celebrate how she chooses. By the time the kid is 6 or 7 will not be the same. You are literally robbing your gf of motherhood experiences that were clearly important to her.", "Actually, I remember my third birthday - and I had two parties. One was at my sitter's house in the back yard at their picnic table with her and her two kids. I got a tiny straw hat, and she arranged to have my picture taken on a pony. The other was that evening with my mom and grandparents. I ate so much cake that I threw up down her back when she picked me up to take me to bed. Good times!\n\nWhere does that leave you? Not sure. But I do know your premise that children that age don't remember is wrong.", "YTA.", "YTA This is going to be fun for him now. It doesn't matter if he fully remembers it later. And tbh it sounds like you don't respect his mom, which is likely to lead to you missing more of the fun than anyone else.", "YTA\n\nI kind of get your point, but really you can't get your way all the time. Besides, even if he doesn't remember it, it's probably good for him, developmentally. It'll make him happy in the moment and likely for some time after, even if he can't remember it when he's your age.\n\nHis mother wants to celebrate your child, why fight that so hard? \n \nYour mom is wrong though, as a side note. I happen to think you're wrong in this case, but a father's word is absolutely important. It's just not the only one that counts.", "NAH.

What about your child having fun DURING the celebration? Is that not enough?", "YTA. These events aren't just for the kid, dude. You and your gf are both adults who will remember already.\n\n*She* clearly wants this even though she's making it about the kid.

Are you cheap, self absorbed or both??", "Yesterday my mom spent hours gushing about how much fun I had when she took me fishing when I was 5 years old. I have no memory of that fishing tip.

Not everything is about you. Your girlfriend is old enough to remember the party even if your child isn\u2019t. These parties are celebrations for the parents, not just the kids.

In my case a 19 yr old brother", "What is such a problem that you literally said you\u2019re going crazy over it? Are you that traumatized by your young self in a Toy Story costume? Parties are gatherings for everyone to enjoy. This may not be conscious but it\u2019s a chance to uphold and strengthen social ties around you, your girlfriend and your child. As a mother to a young kid your gf may also be craving socialization is that so wrong to fulfill? If she wanted to spend $10k on it or something that would be worthy of discussion, but I\u2019m really not hearing anything serious. Definitely stop fighting her about this party, your kid will be fine and might even have some fun! Btw I don\u2019t want you to sour it for them either. Make sure you work on your attitude in time for the party so you don\u2019t make others uncomfortable.", "YTA. Let people enjoy things. I\u2019m hosted large parties for my kids starting when they were 1. They don\u2019t remember them, but I\u2019d do and I have fabulous memories as a result.", "NTA you have been having suitable parties every year that your kid can enjoy. A basic rule is to have as many child guests as the age number of the birthday boy/girl. Eg a 5 year old invites 5 friends. Little kids often  get overwhelmed at big parties.", "YTA. Just because you don\u2019t remember your Toy Story party doesn\u2019t mean your child won\u2019t remember this (it\u2019s absolutely possible). And just because he may not remember it in 20 years doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t remember it next year, the year after, etc. because he will - especially if it\u2019s a big deal that is out of the ordinary. That\u2019s how core memories are made. But anyway, you are choosing to turn your child\u2019s birthday into a power struggle. I could understand if your gf wanted to spend thousands of dollars when y\u2019all are broke or do something totally extra that made you/your kid uncomfortable. But that\u2019s not what you said, it seems like she just wants a nice themed party with other children and family. What is the issue?", "Yta but so is your mom for saying you don't get a say. HOWEVER you ARE an asshole for not doing bday parties your girlfriend and mother in law is right you are depriving your child and you are selfish", "Yta.  For the record, I remember my third birthday.", "INFO: Were you ever bullied at a birthday party? Or something else? It really sounds like a deeper issue here, because it's very strange that you appear embarrassed by having worn a costume when you were 3, rather than valuing the insight into the parts of your childhood you don't remember. I'd love to have videos of when I was that age, but it seems like for you there was something else.\n\nDo you think that the party would be done in such a way that your son doesn't actually enjoy it? What is the deeper issue here?", "YTA. Why do you feel the need to rain on her parade. She wants to celebrate her child. You don't? Why?", "YTA. If he won\u2019t remember, it doesn\u2019t matter. So all that\u2019s left to consider is what you and your gf want. You got your way for two years. Why can\u2019t she throw a party if that\u2019s what makes her happy?", "Definitely give him wonderful experiences because those are the foundation he will build upon regardless of whether he remembers them.\n\nOk, moving on to the WTF part:\n\n>My mom says I should just do what my girlfriend says because Dad's word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.\n\nExcuse me?! A father is every bit as critical and important as a mother. Both parents bring different things to enrich the lives of their children. One of my friends lost her father when she was really young. Her earliest memory was when they visited her father at work and she toddled ahead and peeked in the open door despite not being supposed to bother him until he came out. She said he turned and saw her and that he smiled at her with so much love. Fathers and mothers are both valuable parts of childhood (with the sadly necessary disclaimer that toxic behavior is of course different).", "YTA. Toddler bday parties arent for the kids to remember. Its for the parents to celebrate. This isnt just his 3rd birthday, its her 3rd year of being a mom. Let her have her fun. Is it really hurting anyone?", "YTA.  Most babies I know have bigger 1st birthdays.  Stop being cheap and just doing what you want.  Your girlfriend did what you wanted the past two years, although she didn't agree.  It's her turn to do what she wants.", "100% your an asshole. At lest you now know and can change your ways. Fuck for my boys 1st we throw a huge party and slammed 35 people into the house. His 2nd I even rented a bouncy castle for him plus all the other kids and it was great. Let kids have fun well they can they only grow up to a unfair world with things they will only dream of getting and probably never will.", "People think that kids not consciously remembering things means they\u2019re essentially unaffected by stuff. But we know that\u2019s not true. He may not consciously remember but the emotional imprint of the experience will inform his views of himself and his loved ones. Not to mention the new neurological pathways that will\nbe formed from the experience will be foundational to understanding and interacting with other life experiences in the future. He will remember. His subconscious will remember. His cells will remember. Start making good memories now.", "NTA", "Maybe this party is for your partner? Maybe she wants to celebrate her child and show off to friends and family and enjoy actually having a child and doing fun things with them? You seem sad to not want to do this for them and with her.

You can tell of (almost) every single object what it tastes like. You don't remember when you licked it but you still know how it tastes. This always helps me to remember that even though little children don't remember exactly what happened their hearts do remember", "Exactly, just put the kid in a box until they turn 5, what can possibly go wrong?? /s", "Was going to say this myself. I am certain that there were many fun days in my childhood that I just don't remember anymore. Fun in the moment is important, even if you don't remember it decades from now.\n\nYTA OP, let your kid enjoy the day.", "I wonder if she worded it exactly like that or if that\u2019s interpretation", "He might not remember, but he will experience the feeling that all these people thought it was worth making a whole big deal just to celebrate him. It will be a lesson in how special and beloved he is, and he will learn it and retain it even if he doesn\u2019t recall the specific events.", "Me thinks that he feels overshadowed by the son. Lowkey jealousy.", "Yeah how love how he _explains_ to her things that are 100% subjective opinion. \n\nI hope his GF  _explains_ to him that he is annoying and exhausting and wrong.", "My son is around this age, too. We've admittedly not thrown him big parties for his other birthdays, either, but we are this year. It's his first year of preschool, so it's a little more special because he now has his own friends we can invite and he is able to actually give us input on what he wants (theme, type of cake, etc.) That part has been fun. I get where OP is coming from because I used to think the same thing to an extent, but seeing how excited my kid is for his upcoming party that he may or may not remember and how excited I am for him, I feel silly ever thinking that.", "My take on this isn't that it's for mom who wants to plan parties. It's for her to post on social media. \n\nThe kid will not have any kind of bad memory of having a party of family and friends as a kid versus a massive, expensive party.", "I think context is needed for that statement.\n\nYeah, could be a super crappy statement by OP mom because she was frustrated by her son denying her grandson a party.\n\nOr\n\nIf he had made a statement like \"well, I'm the man of the house so my word goes\" then I can see that as a perfectly reasonable response, to say your word as a dad isnt that important to completely veto what the mom wants and you should know that your role as a father is thinking of your son not yourself.", "This honestly suggests to me that OP has much deeper issues going on. He seems embarrassed to have worn a costume when he was 3 and the \"at his expense\" thing is just.. really concerning. There's something much deeper at play here.", ">parties are as much for the family and friends who love and want to celebrate (and spoil a little) the child as much as it is for the birthday kid\n\nYes this AND also a way to build your community - your emergency daycare pickup, your source of hand-me-downs, your \"lets-trade-babysitting\" friends, and your emotional support through the insanity that is parenting a toddler. Inviting your people to a silly lil toddler birthday party is a great way to show people you want them in your life.", "Omg", "I just turned 41 and my 3rd birthday party is so clear...I recall toys, the cake, what movie we had on,  who I played with... this guy is a total ah", "They may not remember specifics, but they remember how their parents made them feel. They remember mom/dad made their birthday important.", "My first vivid and extended memory is of my 3rd birthday party, so OP's kid is already at the point where they might be able to remember these things *if the experience is something worth remembering*. \n\nAnd shouldn't the point be to make the kid happy while they're experiencing the moment rather than the perceived potential value of recalling it years later?", "I actually do remember bits of my 3rd birthday and came across photos years later that confirmed my memory.  Panda cake was the biggest. Even if I didn't,  the experiences are enriching to a kid.", "This!", "Not having a grand party doesn't affect that feel though. Throughout my childhood my birthdays were usually a fancy dinner and cake with presents. My parents made my birthday important without having to throw a MASSIVE expensive party.\n\nThis is honestly a first world kind of problem.

Toddler birthday parties are just as much for the parents! Obviously not at the expense of what the kid would enjoy, but I feel like especially now, when so many toddlers and parents of toddlers lost so many 'small baby' moments to the pandemic (I have a two year old, I didn't have a shower, basically no one but my midwife saw me pregnant, I didn't have family in town for months after his birth - that stuff is still a little emotionally sore for me!) - throw the damn party! \n\n(Plus my kiddo had a BALL at his party last month and still walks around telling everyone \"happy birthday!\")", "I do agree with you but to be fair, your idea of massive and his idea of massive may be vastly different. Where did it say her party would cost thousands? I\u2019ve had \u201cbig\u201d parties that have cost less than some small (immediate family only) celebrations for my kids.", "I'll be taking my then-7-month old on vacation in July.. he won't remember it at all. And although I'm definitely not looking forward to the 13 hour drive, I'm without a doubt looking forward to the rest of it! \n\nHave a blast with your daughter!!!"]}
