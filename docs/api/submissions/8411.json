It can be a great way to get a better sense of proportion or flow when you're just starting out, and the vast majority of artists do go through a tracing phase, but mimicry taken too seriously can impede development of your own style. I'd suggest maybe trying to study some pics/illustrations you like and then trying to recreate them without tracing.

If you go back hundreds of years,  the great masters had apprentices and they would learn by emulating,  copying,  and studying the style of their master.  Why would it be wrong to do what you're doing? You aren't copying and passing it off as yours. Your art has clearly benefited from it. It shows dedication to your craft. We don't insult writers for reading other books and learning from them.  We don't insult film directors for watching other movies/TV and learning from them... it's the same thing.

You didn't even post it online. You have done absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nI am not a lawyer and copyright law hurts my brain, but I do wonder if you could claim that your reproduction is protected under dependant copyright law.  The way I understand it, dependent copyright generally applies to situations where you hire another person to edit something that you own the copyright to, for example if you hire an editor to edit a book that you wrote, or you hire a colourist to hire lineart you drew. Technically, the editor/colourist owns the dependent copyright on the work that they produced, until they grant their dependent copyright to you, usually when you pay them for their work. So, even though you own the copyright to the original manuscript or lineart, you can't publish the edited or coloured work until you acquire the dependent copyright from the contractor. But, they also can't publish the edited or coloured work either, because you own the actual copyright and the publishing rights along with it. \n\nAnyway, I'm rambling about this nonsense because I wonder if you could report Kat's post for publishing your artwork without your permission.  Probably wouldn't be enough to hold up in a court of law, but you might be able to dazzle the social media platform's customer service team with big words enough to make them take down the post.

If she were genuinely concerned about the issue of art theft, why wouldn't her ultimatum be \"stop stealing art\"? \n\nI think Kim is being jealous and petty. I also don't think she's your friend. Nta", "NTA your friend is a moron who knows nothing about the process of learning art. Tell her to Google \"master copy\" \"master study\" and she can apologize to you when she's ready.", "NTA all artists start somewhere, whether it's tracing practice or some original character. I would, however, contact the artists to let them know the REAL truth and show proof about how you have never actually shared your practices with people or online, because if the wrong artist gets word about their work being \"stolen\" they will call you out if they have a big enough fan base.", "Its hilarious to think about. Just look at a whole gallery of different people's artworks and you'll soon find how many people \"steal\" or use a pose that someone else has used with some slight tweaks. I'm not even an artist but I am a nerd and I've seen so many different characters looking for references for things I think up that all share the exact same pose.", "NTA\n\n> I have never shared these works online, among friends or for profit. They purely existed for me and only for me to practice. \n\nIf you literally just did them for practice - like a lot of artists do - there's really nothing wrong with it\n\n>Kat told me that if stop doing art she will stop talking about it. \n\nThere's the real AH", "NTA. Tracing practice is pretty standard when you are learning to draw. My 12 year old niece started out learning that way and then she learned how to draw it in her own style and then eventually started coming up with her own original art. As long as you are not publishing the art or trying to pass it off as your own or profiting from it, then there is nothing wrong.", "NTA at all. Kat sounds insane and you should immediately drop her. What doesn't she understand about practice?!?! What the hell is her problem? Ask her: when someone plays a piece of music that somebody else wrote, does that ake the a thief and talentless hack? Does she use recipes that others wrote? SIng songs, etc? \n\nartist here and btw - the best way to practice is not to continue to trace. Find a live model (best) or work from photographs. A manikin is helpful as well - can order off amazon. Tracing is really self defeating as you're learning how to trace, not how to draw. Get comfortable with line work b/f moving on to shading, 3d modeling and color.", "110% agree as a fellow artist! Kat is not a good art friend. :(  NTA op. I hope you continue to draw and find some friends who aren\u2019t toxic.", "nta\n\nbloody hell if someone were to recreate some of my woodworking pieces because they liked them and wanted to see how well they would manage if anything thats a compliment", "You mean you didn't just magically start being good at art?", "I\u2019m an artist as well and most other artists I know learned by tracing. NTA at all", "Since I haven't seen anybody else mention it:  Kat's demand that you stop doing art is cruel.   She's enjoying being controlling, and enjoying taking away something you love.  I bet that's most of her motivation, being able to order you around.", "Agree. I'll take a random screenshot or image of a character I like and trace it/recolour it/whatever. I do it not only just for fun, something to do while I listen to some music or relax for example, but because it helps me to get used to drawing certain parts of a character and working on my own artstyle. I'm not good at drawing stuff like hands, so tracing pictures and getting used to how other people draw hands helps me figure it out.\n\nI don't upload them or claim them, I just do it in my own time.", "This. OP, I'm an artist as well, and this is how most artists learn. I even watched Youtube videos of artists who SUGGEST you learn by copying other artists' work. They specifically said that you can't sell these works, etc., but that it was a good way to learn.\n\nOP, I would be done with this \"friend.\" I would block her on everything. I would reach out to the original artist and say, \"I'm so sorry to reach out, but I recently had a friend, BLANK, over who went through my tracing folder, where I put my practice pieces. She then took pictures of one of them, and then reached out to you saying I'm stealing your work. I'm not selling these pieces. I didn't intend to show them to anyone. I really apologize if this situation upset you in any way, but I assure you that I'm not taking your artwork in any way.\"\n\nAny friends who contact you, say, \"I really hope you don't sing along to songs in the car, or you're stealing those artists' works. This is exactly the same. Most artists learn to draw by copying the work of others. That work goes into a folder. It isn't sold. It isn't claimed as original art. BLANK dug through my practice folder, took pictures of my work, and now is blasting me. If you think that's okay, you should immediately stop singing in your car. Because singing in your car to an artist's song MUST mean you are claiming their work for your own and intend to profit off of it, NOT that you're just singing in your car for personal enjoyment... like I'm tracing other artists' work for enjoyment.\"", "whats the saying, \"good artist borrow, great artists steal\"?", "Copying is literally a timeless tradition. In his early career, Peter Paul Rubens copied paintings of Titian and Caravaggio. Manet\u2019s most famous painting is after Titian too. And even further back, so many \u201cGreek\u201d marble sculptures are actually Roman copies of Greek bronzes that are now lost. We only have them because the Romans respected the original enough to copy.  \n\nRegardless though you\u2019re not even posting these or selling them anywhere so I don\u2019t get why your friend is being such a weirdo. Maybe she\u2019s just jealous.", "I mean, the artists didnt consent being used as coloring book, but as long as its on a private IPad- who cares.", "This is the response I was looking for!\n\nAlso not a lawyer but I think this falls under defamation as well. Kat has called out OP as a fraud, that's going to affect her if she wants to start commissions at any point.\n\nKat is an unbelievable AH. OP, not so much.", "\"omg I just realised Van Gogh was a thief in his past... imagine supporting art thieves smh...\"", ">When I came back she was taking a picture of my iPad\n\nOP's so-called friend took a pic of the tracing practice while OP was in the restroom.", "Wait until she hears about all these people stealing Shakespeare's work and performing it on stage!", "This! And she seems jealous of the skills you've built through practice. Any of those other friends who think you're \"stealing\" art bc you've traced it, and w/o any financial gain, is not using their noodle. It could also be there are other suppositions kat related but honestly this is petty and stupid to stake your moral high ground on considering it's a learning experience. Seems the original artist didn't give a damn.", "And by putting the traceries out there, she is the one improperly using others' art.", "Exactly this.", "I disagree. Copying art IS how I learned to understand it. But we all learn differently.", "The tracing is about learning muscle memory and technique. Neither of those things require creativity, But are simply fundamental skills that you later use when you're actually being creative.", "That's only if you suck at studying", "Nit:  I wouldn't say La Grande Odalisque is a copy of Titian; more like a riff on Titian.  But absolutely not plagiarism in either case!", "As the artist, knowing they didn't claim it as theirs, the fact that they liked my art enough TO trace is for practice is like..... incredibly nice to hear?? I'd be estatic? Like oh my goodness what a huge compliment", "Only one person has posted them online lol", "Ehm no? The original artist still needs to consent this. Even if you give credit- you also need permission.\n(Otherwise its not only ethical wrong but also against Copyright)", "Same\ud83e\udd23 Like she feeding art of heir friend into an AI and claiming it as her own\ud83e\udd23", "Lmao! AITA: robbed a museum, people are mad, here's how I did it...", "They are, but what they steal is gigs from bands that actually write their own music :P", "Ah, Shakespeare's just a bunch of old cliches anyway.", "I agree, I would be incredibly flattered.", "Exactly.", "Yeah I had a friend who said she didn\u2019t like hip hop because they steal other peoples music. I said she was lazy to not even try to listen to how the music is mixed. Lame!", "Artwork in its entirety is different to a single quote. Its incomparable. Unless part of a 'draw this your way' challenge or likewise, if you're physically copying and tracing someone's artwork then that practise should stay private, regardless of if you're stating it was just practise or not. If you want to showcase that you're practising, create something of your own or use a drawing challenge.", "[Here you go!](https://youtu.be/JdxkVQy7QLM)", "It isn\u2019t a 1:1 copy. She traces to practice technique and then colors how she wants. \n\nIt\u2019s not a shameful practice she needs to keep private. You are allowed to take pride in your work, so long as it is properly attributed.", "So that was hilarious!\n\n\n[for the lazy](https://youtu.be/JdxkVQy7QLM)", "As expected!", "Or, you can go to your local library and check out sheet music on your card for free.", "Or download it from IMSLP for free", "Attribution doesn't make it ok under copyright. A straight trace with different colors seems unlikely to count as transformative.", "I play acoustic guitar for my church. Worship music almost solely consists of G-D-Em-C. Four chords. Heck, you can play almost ANYTHING with just those four chords. Maybe you change it up and play D-A-Bm-G -- just ask the Axis of Awesome https://youtu.be/5pidokakU4I", "If they have it yes. Mine doesn\u2019t have much in the way of selection. But libraries are great resources", "Ahh you attend the kind of church my mother would've called too worldly. \n\n(My mother believes if it's not a old times Anglican hymn it's not real church music. Her Puritanism is probably a bigger part of why I'm now an atheist metalhead than I care to admit hahaha)"]}
