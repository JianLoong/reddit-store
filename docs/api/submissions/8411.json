And putting effort into developing your craft is admirable; please don't stop.\n\nThat said: if you're trying to develop your personal artistic style, you shouldn't rely on tracing *too* frequently. It can be a great way to get a better sense of proportion or flow when you're just starting out, and the vast majority of artists do go through a tracing phase, but mimicry taken too seriously can impede development of your own style. I'd suggest maybe trying to study some pics/illustrations you like and then trying to recreate them without tracing.

If you go back hundreds of years,  the great masters had apprentices and they would learn by emulating,  copying,  and studying the style of their master.  Why would it be wrong to do what you're doing? You aren't copying and passing it off as yours. Your art has clearly benefited from it. It shows dedication to your craft. We don't insult writers for reading other books and learning from them.  We don't insult film directors for watching other movies/TV and learning from them... it's the same thing.

You didn't even post it online. You have done absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nI am not a lawyer and copyright law hurts my brain, but I do wonder if you could claim that your reproduction is protected under dependant copyright law.  The way I understand it, dependent copyright generally applies to situations where you hire another person to edit something that you own the copyright to, for example if you hire an editor to edit a book that you wrote, or you hire a colourist to hire lineart you drew. Technically, the editor/colourist owns the dependent copyright on the work that they produced, until they grant their dependent copyright to you, usually when you pay them for their work. So, even though you own the copyright to the original manuscript or lineart, you can't publish the edited or coloured work until you acquire the dependent copyright from the contractor. But, they also can't publish the edited or coloured work either, because you own the actual copyright and the publishing rights along with it. \n\nAnyway, I'm rambling about this nonsense because I wonder if you could report Kat's post for publishing your artwork without your permission.  Probably wouldn't be enough to hold up in a court of law, but you might be able to dazzle the social media platform's customer service team with big words enough to make them take down the post.

People who think copying isn't a common tool for learning have no idea what they are talking about. Copying has been a learning tool for an extremely long time with artists training others by having them copy their own work. Your friend is super out of line.\n\nAs an art teacher I've seen this happen many times (among middle schoolers) where one will get upset that their friend is tracing and getting attention for their art. Send your friend some articles about tracing as a learning tool, hell, if you've been put on blast send the articles to your friends too.", "NTA also fellow artist here. Tracing is a very common way of learning to create art through self teaching. Similarly, you\u2019ll see a lot of artists who use photos of people and trace their forms to get good at anatomy. It\u2019s also extremely common for artists to go out and take their own photos and straight up trace them for comics to cut out some of the leg work.\n\nWhat\u2019s her argument here? Nobody can copy anything ever? What the hell does she think patreon is? A schem for artists to accuse people of copyrighting?\n\nYou are only copying or plagiarizing if you *copy someone\u2019s work* or it\u2019s influence *heavily*, or steal a specific component of the work and try to pass it off as your own, especially if you sell it.\n\nFrankly, there\u2019s nothing wrong with artists posting their traced work online as long as they are clear in the title that it is traced work and link by the original artists. (Also they should verify that it\u2019s okay with the artists.) I\u2019ve seen many amateur artists do this so people can critic work, it\u2019s actually quite a useful for the artist to see where they are lacking and for the people helping to see so they can point it out.\n\nArt is visual and it\u2019s all about perspective. Having a baseline like a picture your traced and the original to compare it to can give you the ability to spot the flaws and differences.", "NTA. She and the friends are idiots who have no clue about how people learn art.\n\nYou're doing studies. That's a standard practice.", "NTA: your \u2018friend\u2019 clearly has some issues with you. What you\u2019ve done is totally fine. So long as your nit profiting from, or claiming work to be yours all is fine. Practicing like that is totally fine... lol. Imaging a musician playing someone else\u2019s music, telling everyone it was Beethoven and then the crowd getting angry...", "Nta. Your friends are stupid af. You need new ones... maybe people that knows the difference between recreating and stealing. \n\nYou had no profit from that images, so how is that stealing? What you did is actually the same process every artist do in order to understand how to draw and learn. You learn how to do art coping others, once you learnd you make your own original art.\n\nFr you need to hang out with smarter people. I'm so mad at your behalf.", "\"So last week I had my friend Kat over...\"\n\nUmmm she was never your friend. \n\nNTA", " NTA this is what art students have done for millennial. Students look at the art of great artists and sketch it or try to copy it for exactly the reason you state - to get a feel for what they did and to learn from it. So long as you aren\u2019t trying to exhibit those pieces as your own or profit from them then you are fine.", "Kat needs to spend less time on twitter.\nNTA.", "NTA. Holy shit your \"friend\" Kat is a garbage person. Is there any artistic skill that doesn't get honed by mimicking established artists in that genre? Drawing, painting, filmmaking, songwriting, photography, writing, the list goes on and on.", "Clearly NTA, Tracing and using references for self improvement should never be considered stealing.", "NTA\n\nBut your 'friend' Kat is. Learning art by copying other works isn't wrong as long as you do exactly what you did with them, which was nothing. This situation sucks, as she's gone off the deep end with it.", "NTA - as long as you weren't taking those tracings and making a pattern for a Spoonflower contest or something, you're in the clear.", "> Good artist borrow, Great Artists steal. \n\n-T. S. Eliot\n\n> Now everybody\u2019s sampling. \n\n-Missy Elliott\n\nThe artist that your \u201cfriend\u201d sent the images to is likely scratching her head saying, \u201cwell that\u2019s how I learned how to draw, too.\u201d\n\nNTA I don\u2019t know a single artist that hasn\u2019t done this. Most of the art classes I\u2019ve been in give some assignment based around copying another\u2019s work. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is being ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYou are not passing the work off as yours, recreating it for sale, nor posting it for traffic and follower building. Tracing and copying are very normal methods people employ to learn technique and perspective.", "NTA.\n\nEvery digital artist does this. There are artist that have been doing it for awhile that will still do this for the sake of practice or just wanting to doodle with something cool they found. As long as you\u2019re not posting it online as your own, there is no harm in it. It\u2019s literally just a blueprint.", "NTA, even tho I dont think this isnt the best way to learn. When copying, your brain gets lazy to quickly and only concentrates on cooying than UNDERSTANDING the picture. \nINFO tho, how was she able to show others your trace when you didnt upload it anywhere?", "NTA, but I definitely think there is a lot left out.", "These busybodies aren't your friends. Ditch these losers. NTA", "Tracing and copying to learn has been going on since art began! The reason we have actual decent, bright versions of the Mona Lisa is because Leonardo da Vinci's apprentices copied it to practice. (The real one's varnish has yellowed and dimmed, but because of an experimental technique da Vinci used to paint the portrait it's impossible to safely clean and restore. Thankfully we have wonderful copies!)", "OP, send a link to this thread to those who think you\u2019re \u201cstealing.\u201d", "NTA visit the Louvre and there are art students practicing by recreating the works that hang there.  Your friend is an idiot trying to start drama where there is none.  Remind her to never, ever sing along to her favorite artists as that would be theft by her definition", "She\u2019s overreacting AND ignorant. And also a snoop who violated your privacy. You should let all your friends know that by her own admission, she is not someone who can be trusted.", "NTA. My brothers are artists. This is how you learn, and this is how artists have learned for centuries.", "You mean you didn't just magically start being good at art? You had to learn and practice? I'm starting to see where I've been going wrong!", "As an artist, I dont think this is the best way to learn at all. When copying, your brain gets lazy to quickly and only concentrates on copying rather than UNDERSTANDING the picture. NTA tho, unless you did post it somewhere.", "Like Caravaggio and Artemisia Gentileschi?", "The artist, if they saw the message, probably didn't care since the OP didn't post it anywhere and never claimed it was hers. There's also a fair chance that artist did something similar when *they* were learning.", "Imagine one day coming on here and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist is solved in an AITA post \ud83e\udd23", "[removed]", "Yes, exactly! In art school, we were encouraged to copy classic art. Studying and looking at a piece is one thing, but it's another to sit down and try to replicate it.", "God, I hope she does because those people are being ridiculous. The OP didn't do anything wrong, at all.", "People like this definitely think that using a photo for reference is \u201ccheating\u201d as well. They are insufferable.", "I was also thinking about Sturtevant copying Warhol, Lichtenstein, Haring and many more  \nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer himself made a lot of money as a copyist  \nManet's Luncheon on the Grass was copied by Pablo Picasso and Jeff Koons among many others  \nVincent van Gogh copied many other artists : The Good Samaritan by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix / Prisoners Exercising by Gustave Dor\u00e9 / Noon Rest from Work by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet / The Raising of Lazarus by Rembrandt ...  \nLeonardo da Vinci / John Singer Sargeant / Claude Monet / Michalangelo ... They all copied other painters.", "Which is plain stupid since cover songs are *cumpulsory licenses*. An artist is forced to license them for a preset nominal fee and royalty arrangement.", "[removed]", "Actually no. If you post it as a demonstration of the skill that you were practicing and not as your original content, there is no issue. You are allowed to showcase your skills and improvement to your friends on social\nmedia, as long as you don\u2019t imply it was your original design or attempt to make money off of it. \n\nPeople post quotes from books and movies that resonate with them all the time. Often without attribution or wrong attribution because they pulled it from someone else\u2019s post. No one accuses them of copying someone else\u2019s art or skill.

Look up Pachelbel Rant", "You still need to pay for the sheet music or the arrangements.", "As someone who at one point played classical piano, it's so true and once you see it you can't unsee it. \n\nMy least favorite song that hits that phenomenon is Last Kiss.  I learned guitar in high school and that has to be the *single most boring song to play on a guitar in the history of ever*.\n\nIt has the most basic strumming pattern, the most basic chords and you literally do nothing but play the same 4 chords and the same strumming pattern for the ENTIRE SONG.  There's not even a goddamn key change or tempo change to mix it up. Just G-Em-C-D. Forever. \n\nDo you know how long I was stuck playing that one song for at least 5 hours per week for the high school music recital because I'd wanted to try something other than piano and the music teacher was a sexist prick who wouldn't let a girl learn drums? Eight. MONTHS. \n\nI got turned off guitar by that. That song is the guitar player's equivalent of Pachelbel 's Canon for cello. To this day my eyelid starts to twitch if I hear it lol.\n\nPlease don't inflict that song in any aspiring guitarists you know. It's so boring."]}
