I always had a vague interest in art but never had any training or even really took classes so it seemed insurmountable to begin. However I watched lots of YouTube videos and read tons of tips online and spent most of the first two years working on basic things such as hands, feet, anatomy, clothes, hair, etc. \n\nAfter I finally felt like I had really gotten a grasp on the basics I started getting into the idea of developing my own style. I didn't really know the best way to do this so I just started tracing other artists work to get practice with things like line weight and flow. I would take a picture of an artist who had a nice style and would download the image, copy the line art and then normally color it however I felt. It would then get thrown into a folder in procreate labelled \"trace practice\". I have never shared these works online, among friends or for profit. They purely existed for me and only for me to practice. \n\nSo last week I had my friend Kat (27F) over and while we were just hanging out and talking I was practicing some anatomy. This consisted of the way Kat was sitting or standing, she knew I was practicing while we were talking and asked if she could look at it once I was finished.\n\nSo I had just wrapped up my sketch and I asked her if she wanted to look. She took my iPad and I went to the restroom. When I came back she was taking a picture of my iPad so I asked her what was going on. She asked why I had copied artist's picture. I explained to her exactly what I said above but she was not happy with this answer. She started calling me a thief and a talentless hack. After some back and forth she said she was leaving. \n\nI didn't hear anything about the situation for a few days when my other friend, Danielle texted me saying she put me on blast. She showed me the texts from her to our other friends. They basically showed the original artist's work, my copy and some texts explaining how I tried to defend stealing the image. She was so mad about it she even reached out to the original artist and gave her my name and socials. I thanked Danielle for telling me and decided to text Kat. Kat told me that if stop doing art she will stop talking about it. \n\nNow a few of my friends are on her side and think I am an asshole for what I did but a few are also on my side.

You're fine. Your friend is overreacting.", "If you'd tried to sell them and/or pass them off as your own work, you'd have been in the wrong. You did neither of these things. Your friends need to calm down. NTA.", "Hi ! Phd in History of Arts here. Copying an artist's work to pretend it's yours and make money out of it would definitely be stealing and absolutely not ok !! Sketching to practice your art / being inspired by an artist's style is totally different / looking for your own style and exploring different possibilities and so on is totally different ... So many major artists have been inspiring each other for centuries or even recreating other artists work in their own style. I don't even understand what is wrong with what you did honestly. You need better friends imo. NTA", "Nta, her logic is like saying doing a colouring book is a breach of copyright", "NTA.\n\nAs you said, you didn't share this art and label it as your own, nor did you sell it. It was purely for practice. Your friend is not your friend", "I recommend this book: Steal Like an Artist. NTA", "You're in the clear. Studying another artist's work is a quite common way to practice, and as long as you're not publishing it without credit, it's alright NTA", "Glad this wasn't about what I assumed it was going to be about.\n\nOkay. NTA.\n\nYou would be the asshole if you were tracing & recolouring these works and then making them public-facing/passing them off as your own to build your portfolio or gain followers etc.\n\nBut you weren't. You were using them privately to practice honing your skills & personal creative process. And putting effort into developing your craft is admirable; please don't stop.\n\nThat said: if you're trying to develop your personal artistic style, you shouldn't rely on tracing *too* frequently. It can be a great way to get a better sense of proportion or flow when you're just starting out, and the vast majority of artists do go through a tracing phase, but mimicry taken too seriously can impede development of your own style. I'd suggest maybe trying to study some pics/illustrations you like and then trying to recreate them without tracing. This can be a good way to figure out 'weak spots' in your technique roster and also help develop personal style.", "NTA\n\n\nIf you were selling them she'd have a point. But you aren't, so she is just being crazy.", "It isn't illegal to want to practice and learn new things. You weren't using the art for anything but a learning tool. Your friend needs to let it go. NTA!", "If you trace art purely for practice purposes and don't post it publicly nor claim it as your own, I think it's fine. As I understanding, this is what you were doing so NTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re just trying to learn. Kats crazy.", "NTA There is nothing wrong with copying the art of good artists for practice as long as you never claim that the copies are your original  work or present them as your art. You even clearly labelled them \"trace practice\" and never shared them.\n\nYour friend is totally out of line. She is the one who shared this and made it public when it was only ever practice work in a private folder.\n\nArtists have always copied the greats for practice. On a practical note, you will get much more benefit out of copying freehand than tracing, but that's by-the-by here.\n\nI would keep your defense short and sweet. Your friend took a never-shared folder clearly labelled \"trace practice\" and broadcast pictures from it on SNS as stolen art when she is the only one who has ever shared the copies. You have never claimed the practice works to be your original art or ever put them on SNS or anywhere other than that folder.", "NTA, this is an extroardinarily normal way to practice. This is literally a centuries-old tradition, and most painters' training historically involved going to the museum and copying paintings from Old Masters. You could even sell your own if they were skilled - provided you didn't try to pass them off as an original! Museums literally set aside time for current artists to copy the classics.\n\nHonestly, your 'friend' is being a giant drama queen and a huge AH. *She's* the one who took a photo of non-original work and distributed, and also she was snooping through your iPad because that's not the photo you showed her. I'd say that's a person you don't want in your life, though it sucks for you because your friends will hear two versions and won't necessarily know which is real. But you've definitely done nothing wrong if you just kept them privately for practice, and contacting the original artist is a pathological level of drama-seeking.", "NTA You never said they were your work or tried to sell them.", "NTA you never claimed them as yours. Lots of artists do that.\n\nAnd she invaded your privacy and took pictures of your device without consent. I would go to the cops", "So you were tracing other artists work as drawing practice?  That\u2019s not stealing\u2026and I don\u2019t really understand why anyone would think it is\u2026\n\nNTA", "Nta. I learned by printing pictures of Teen Titans and Rainbow Bright and tracing them.", "NTA and frankly what your so called \"friend\" is doing is pretty gross. Of course it would be totally different if you were publishing or promoting these traced pieces as your own work, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with using other artists' work to simply learn. In fact, I've actually encouraged my elementary aged child to do this when she first started learning, and now she's really quite talented despite being so young and self taught.", "NTA\n\nYou did not claim the work as your own, you didn't try to profit of the work calling it your own, you didn't share it online or among friends.\n\nYou even had the work in a folder called \"Trace Practice\".  You clearly had it labelled as tracing practice.  Tracing is a tool for learning to draw, helping with perspective, anatomy, your hand/eye coordination and such.  It might not be the answer to how to learn to draw but it can be helpful.\n\nYour friend \"borrowed\" your ipad under false pretenses, took pictures, shared the work and made false claims.  She is in the wrong here.", "Tracing art is bad?\nClaiming the art you trace as yours, that\u2019s bad\nShowing off/making profit off the trace work, you should go to jail!\n\nTwo of the things you didn\u2019t do.  They were your personal and private experience to make a full anatomy (which is not easy to do and take time, effective and first time goers TRACE).\n\nLet we all trace something like the outline of a tree or our own hands on paper.  Soon enough we find our own short cuts.  Using certain shapes and lines or look for models that we take a photo and trace over to make into something else.  Hell, people trace manga characters to make their own insert or off sonic clone from the start but in 5 years in the line, they become something else and original.\n\nHonestly, once you talk to these artist and explain you were not meant no harm and they you were trying to find your own style, they might kindly help you or understand.  Since you never posted these trace drawings out in public and trying to find your right style. \n\nAlso, it don\u2019t sound like you do it EVERY time you draw.  \n\nSo not the butt hole.

Studying and copying artists,  and trying to better your art is a tradition as old as art itself.  There was various points,  in my art studies,  where a teacher/ lecturer would suggest I looked at X or Y artist as they thought it would benefit me. There were even modules of art appreciation in my degree.  If you go back hundreds of years,  the great masters had apprentices and they would learn by emulating,  copying,  and studying the style of their master.  Why would it be wrong to do what you're doing? You aren't copying and passing it off as yours. Your art has clearly benefited from it. It shows dedication to your craft. We don't insult writers for reading other books and learning from them.  We don't insult film directors for watching other movies/TV and learning from them... it's the same thing.
