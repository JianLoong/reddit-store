And putting effort into developing your craft is admirable; please don't stop.\n\nThat said: if you're trying to develop your personal artistic style, you shouldn't rely on tracing *too* frequently. It can be a great way to get a better sense of proportion or flow when you're just starting out, and the vast majority of artists do go through a tracing phase, but mimicry taken too seriously can impede development of your own style. I'd suggest maybe trying to study some pics/illustrations you like and then trying to recreate them without tracing.

If you go back hundreds of years,  the great masters had apprentices and they would learn by emulating,  copying,  and studying the style of their master.  Why would it be wrong to do what you're doing? You aren't copying and passing it off as yours. Your art has clearly benefited from it. It shows dedication to your craft. We don't insult writers for reading other books and learning from them.  We don't insult film directors for watching other movies/TV and learning from them... it's the same thing.

You didn't even post it online. You have done absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nI am not a lawyer and copyright law hurts my brain, but I do wonder if you could claim that your reproduction is protected under dependant copyright law.  The way I understand it, dependent copyright generally applies to situations where you hire another person to edit something that you own the copyright to, for example if you hire an editor to edit a book that you wrote, or you hire a colourist to hire lineart you drew. Technically, the editor/colourist owns the dependent copyright on the work that they produced, until they grant their dependent copyright to you, usually when you pay them for their work. So, even though you own the copyright to the original manuscript or lineart, you can't publish the edited or coloured work until you acquire the dependent copyright from the contractor. But, they also can't publish the edited or coloured work either, because you own the actual copyright and the publishing rights along with it. \n\nAnyway, I'm rambling about this nonsense because I wonder if you could report Kat's post for publishing your artwork without your permission.  Probably wouldn't be enough to hold up in a court of law, but you might be able to dazzle the social media platform's customer service team with big words enough to make them take down the post.

Our teacher would grade on several things,  chiefly how good we were at copying the masters drawing line for line, shade for shade, muscle for muscle. She would line up the tracing we'd done to see how close we got to the og and that would also help to determine our grade. That is how she taught us, and how she learned at a premier art school in the US. \n\nAnother assignment in a different class literally involved cutting out pictures from various sources, and then putting them in some form of collage, photocopying that and then painting from the photocopy in a monochromatic color scheme. \n\nI could go on and on. It wasn't really until we started branching off into the Watercolor or Oil painting, or sculpting areas that we really started to work on our own styles and perspectives. Our foundations were rooted in the masters that came before us.\n\n But suffice to say that artists have been learning by copying the work of other artists for centuries. Sometimes they monetized the copied work, other times they just used it as a learning tool to develop their own style. \n\nYears ago, there was an exhibit in Venice that showed Edouard Manet's works alongside that various masterpieces (usually Italian) that influenced him.

The saying goes:\nGood Artists copy, Great Artists steal. \n\nHow else are we to learn and hone our skills and adapt it to our repertoire. Your friend can go kick rocks. \nBut heres a tip from one artist to another. Once you're comfortable with tracing your referenceTry to see if you can draw it on your own. See if you can recognize the shapes and edges and adapt your style from that. If you have Twitter/instagram theres a Tag called DTIYS or \"Draw this in your style\" where artists post art where other artists recreate it in their style. Try doing a couple of them to help you out. \nDont let people stop you from pursuing art and whatever makes you happy.

I use to do the same thing so i could understand how the lines \"felt\" for certain shapes and parts.\n\n\nIt's not art theft\n\n\nShe out you on blast, why not put her and show your group this thread.

Though I would not recommend posting it as that WOULD be stealing. I also recommend looking up YCH models, as those can help with posing and learning to draw hair, eyes, and cloths. Most artists learn and are influenced by other artists. You basically mix and match until you have your own style. But tracing is looked down upon for those who post there art.", "NTA. Why was she going through your stuff anyway?", "NTA - You used them for practice and kept them to yourself. there is nothing wrong with that.", "NTA but this is one of the weirdest stories I ever heard. \nWho goes out of their way to take pics of another person's art, knows all the original artwork to actually be able to accuse OP of stealing it and then also makes a fuss with their friend.

Glad it was not!  OP is totally fine with what they are doing.", "Yes!  Please do!", "Frankly, I'd reconsider the old friendship thing with Kat.

When I came back she was taking a picture. \n\nThe way procreate is set up is that there are a bunch of folders with names under them but the folders image is the most recent picture you added to that folder. You get to the folder landing page as soon as you back out from your current picture. So I'm assuming (since we didn't discuss how she figured out I had the traced images) she either backed out on purpose to see my other works or on accident and saw the image and recognized it as another artists. \n\nUntil I showed Kat my poses I had never shown anyone, but my mother, any of my art and even my mom only saw my original pieces.", "Absolutely not necessary to ask the artist for purely private learning via tracing, and in fact it's a bad idea.

That's where Kat was the asshole - Kat was the one who illegally propagated images she didn't create or own.", "Completely agree.\n\nIt's been a long tradition of people setting up in a museum to copy a painting.

They put it up side-by-side with the original, usually.  It's completely normal to practice, trace, or imitate a new style by reworking someone who has the style you like.

They post up the original then their version.

If you had been publicly sharing your progress online via the traced pics or showing them off to others as your own work, that would be another story.

It can help you translate different shapes into different styles. With anatomy, be it more realistic or more exaggerated. You're not using them for profit. You're not claiming them as your own.
