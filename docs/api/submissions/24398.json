If this is what you want, go ahead. If your marriage is solid --I haven't read anything that suggests otherwise in your post-- this disagreement should not affect the relationship too much. But know that the disagreement will still be there. While you should never tolerate your husband make you feed bad about yourself or your body for doing something to it he doesn't agree with, you also cannot expect him to want to see it and compliment you on it once it's done... at least not for a while. If he's a good person and partner, he should just keep his opinion to himself from now on. He voiced it, no need to repeat it. \n\nBut both your and his perspective are valid. I don't think he's necessarily tight with money for prioritizing \"needs\" over \"wants\". That's just his way of living. A stingy person wouldn't want to remodel a perfectly functional bathroom or even think about spending on new countertops unless the current ones were completely decayed, for example. To me he's not tight with money, he's just not into frivolous spending. \n\nAnd there is nothing wrong with frivolous spending when you can afford it, and within your means. There is nothing wrong with investing money in something that makes you happy and makes your life a bit brighter. But that only works if you enjoy it. Which you do. But he doesn't. \n\nI think if the money arguments keep coming up, you guys should think about getting counseling to help you find happy mediums and communicate about this better.

Your body, your rules.", "NAH\n\nSince you are both wage earners, you have the right to take some of the money you earn to do things for yourself.  The only exception would be if your family was struggling, there was no food on the table, there were medical needs ignored, etc.  But since you are doing well and your needs are taken care of, your discretionary spending is something you can decide upon.\n\nThis actually would be a great opportunity for yourself and your husband to sit down together and draft up budgetary plans.\n\nI would set up one account that is for your routine monthly expenses and both of you put a set amount of money per month into that account.  Make it enough that you can easily cover those routine expenses you pay every month (mortgage/rent, utilities, car payments, etc.).  Now you've got your basics covered.  If you want to adjust slightly because he makes a bit more, he could put in a little more per month equal to the differential in your incomes.\n\nNow that you've got your basics covered, you can each look at how much you have left over from your individual pay per month.  This is where you can discuss with each other setting up a second account for household improvements.  Since this will benefit you both (because you will be increasing the value of your home), you each should put a small set monthly amount into this account.  Then, when it is large enough, you can discuss, as a couple, what household project you would like to do next, like replacing countertops, etc.\n\nEverything that is left after that, for yourself and your husband, is your own \"mad money.\"  If  you save that up and want your tattoo (as you already have), then have at it!  You're an adult and you can make your decisions.\n\nI get your husband wanting to do things around the house, but you can't make your home a pit where all your money goes and not do things for yourself now and then.  Agreeing with him to start a separate \"household upgrade\" fund so he can see stuff being put away for those things he would like to do will alleviate his worries over that while still allowing yourself some free cash to do the things you would like, too.

At this point, he is the Ahole if he is seriously pushing this. He has a right to his opinion, and I do think you should consider it. However, it's your choice. You have separate finances and can afford it. You also pull more than your share of the weight, which seems fine to you both, but I think this small desire should be more than acceptable.

I do hope he can get over it and be happy for you.", "NTA, explain to your husband that getting a new tattoo is basically like remodeling your own body, and however happy he thinks redoing the bathroom will make him this tattoo will do that exponentially for you, not to mention likely last longer.", "NTA\n\nI accept I may be biased since I love tattoos. \n\nStarting a family is not a reason to forget that each of you are still individuals.
