He has his bank account and I have mine.  We split house costs mostly 50/50.  He makes about 10k more than I do so he does pay a bit more.\n\nBut he is so tight with money.\n\nI have a tattoo I\u2019ve been wanting to get for a long time.  But I\u2019ve either been pregnant or not financially able to spend frivolously.  \n\nIt will be 400 per sitting for two sittings.  I will have to take work off (paid) and arrange for care for my baby.\n\nI\u2019m paying for this myself.  I work full time from home while also watching our 9 month old.\n\nYes it\u2019s a frivolous expense but am I in the wrong for wanting to get something for myself to make myself feel good?  I am not the type to go get my hair or nails done.  The only frivolous thing I really spend money on is clothing recently because my body has changed since having a baby and nothing fits.\n\nWhen I asked for his opinion last night he finally came out with saying that he\u2019s not on board because there are other things we need to be spending our money on. \n\nHe is concerned because our bathroom needs remodeling and he wants new countertops and he thinks those items keep getting pushed back for other things.  We afford all of the basics just fine.  We are not well off but we are also not struggling to keep food on the table by any means.\n\nAm I wrong to think that there will ALWAYS be a better reason to spend money and it will never be an ideal time to put money into something cosmetic like a tattoo.\n\nSo he will never be on board anyway.\n\nAm I selfish?  We lost our first baby halfway through the pregnancy and I got pregnant again months after.  I feel like I\u2019ve been pregnant for two years and have put everything on hold.  I feel like I don\u2019t even recognize my own body anymore.  This tattoo means a lot to me.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit:  Adding some info.  He himself is covered in expensive tattoos that he did trades and motorcycle work for.  This was pre-marriage and baby.  He now has no interest in getting more tattoos.\n\nThe tattoo itself would be most of my upper arm.  So 5x8 maybe.  I already have tattoos on my forearms and back.  400 per sitting.  First lines then color.  It will be at the end of September and the color sometime in October.\n\nSorry the money situation sounds confusing.  I misspoke I guess.  We do not split bills 50/50 because he makes 10k more than I do.  We have it where I contribute the proportionate amount to what we make in bills.  I also provide all childcare while I am working full time.  I don\u2019t feel one of us provides more than the other when it all boils down.  This has always been agreed upon since we started dating.  He would get a check and I would get the next check.  We have kept our finances separate and live the same way now.  He picks something up, then I do and so on.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect so many comments!  I am working but I will do my best to answer comments when I can.

My late husband was also frugal and often talked of trips he would like to take, but we postponed 90% of them in lieu of putting money into savings.  Then he died unexpectedly and I will always regret not pushing a little harder on fulfilling his travel goals. \n\nTell your husband you could easily spend $800 on a weekend get-away or a designer handbag or whatever.

There is ALWAYS something else that's more practical to spend money on.", "NTA.  This is where compromise in marriage comes in.

As long as he's not outright forbidding you from doing the tattoo neither one of you are an AH.", "NAH. \n\nSince this doesn't read like he's attempting to control what you do with your body, just expressed his opinion on the tattoo after you asked for it, he's not an asshole. \n\nSince this means so much to you, you've thought it through for a while, and you state doing it will not have a negative impact on the family's finances, you're not an asshole. \n\nObviously it's your body and your money. If this is what you want, go ahead. If your marriage is solid --I haven't read anything that suggests otherwise in your post-- this disagreement should not affect the relationship too much. But know that the disagreement will still be there. While you should never tolerate your husband make you feed bad about yourself or your body for doing something to it he doesn't agree with, you also cannot expect him to want to see it and compliment you on it once it's done... at least not for a while. If he's a good person and partner, he should just keep his opinion to himself from now on. He voiced it, no need to repeat it. \n\nBut both your and his perspective are valid. I don't think he's necessarily tight with money for prioritizing \"needs\" over \"wants\". That's just his way of living. A stingy person wouldn't want to remodel a perfectly functional bathroom or even think about spending on new countertops unless the current ones were completely decayed, for example. To me he's not tight with money, he's just not into frivolous spending. \n\nAnd there is nothing wrong with frivolous spending when you can afford it, and within your means. There is nothing wrong with investing money in something that makes you happy and makes your life a bit brighter. But that only works if you enjoy it. Which you do. But he doesn't. \n\nI think if the money arguments keep coming up, you guys should think about getting counseling to help you find happy mediums and communicate about this better.

If he wants new counter tops, tell him to spend his own money on them. Go get your tattoo.", "Just because you are married doesn't mean your husband controls your finances. Mental well being expenses are not frivolous. You are correct that your husband will never think a tattoo should be prioritized before other expenses.

It\u2019s his kid also.", "NTA you deserve a special treat for you after basically being pregnant for two years and all the trauma and bodily changes associated. If he wants to gripe about the bathroom needing a remodel (which is going to be a lot more than $800) then he can fund it.", "NTA. There's always something. Just do it now. Your body, your rules.", "NAH\n\nSince you are both wage earners, you have the right to take some of the money you earn to do things for yourself.  The only exception would be if your family was struggling, there was no food on the table, there were medical needs ignored, etc.  But since you are doing well and your needs are taken care of, your discretionary spending is something you can decide upon.\n\nThis actually would be a great opportunity for yourself and your husband to sit down together and draft up budgetary plans.\n\nI would set up one account that is for your routine monthly expenses and both of you put a set amount of money per month into that account.  Make it enough that you can easily cover those routine expenses you pay every month (mortgage/rent, utilities, car payments, etc.).  Now you've got your basics covered.  If you want to adjust slightly because he makes a bit more, he could put in a little more per month equal to the differential in your incomes.\n\nNow that you've got your basics covered, you can each look at how much you have left over from your individual pay per month.  This is where you can discuss with each other setting up a second account for household improvements.  Since this will benefit you both (because you will be increasing the value of your home), you each should put a small set monthly amount into this account.  Then, when it is large enough, you can discuss, as a couple, what household project you would like to do next, like replacing countertops, etc.\n\nEverything that is left after that, for yourself and your husband, is your own \"mad money.\"  If  you save that up and want your tattoo (as you already have), then have at it!  You're an adult and you can make your decisions.\n\nI get your husband wanting to do things around the house, but you can't make your home a pit where all your money goes and not do things for yourself now and then.  Agreeing with him to start a separate \"household upgrade\" fund so he can see stuff being put away for those things he would like to do will alleviate his worries over that while still allowing yourself some free cash to do the things you would like, too.  Basically, you're covering all the bases.  And, he'll also know that he'll have some \"mad money\" to spend however he likes, too.", "NAH. As a tattooed person I understand your pov and as an accountant I understand your husbands pov. This is definitely a sit down discussion as it is a quite expensive tattoo at $800 total for the sessions plus tip which would make it cost around/ over $1000 in total realistically.

At this point, he is the Ahole if he is seriously pushing this. He has a right to his opinion, and I do think you should consider it. However, it's your choice. You have separate finances and can afford it. You also pull more than your share of the weight, which seems fine to you both, but I think this small desire should be more than acceptable. I am sorry that he doesn't recognize the value of this to you. I do hope he can get over it and be happy for you.", "NTA, explain to your husband that getting a new tattoo is basically like remodeling your own body, and however happy he thinks redoing the bathroom will make him this tattoo will do that exponentially for you, not to mention likely last longer.", "NTA\n\nI accept I may be biased since I love tattoos. \n\nStarting a family is not a reason to forget that each of you are still individuals. Yes the family overall should come first but its important to be an individual person sometimes just for your own mental wellbeing. \n\nFeel free to keep the design you want but being brutally honest. $800 is a lot of money for anything.

It means a lot to you because your relationship with your body has evolved. It\u2019s not selfish, you are looking for some personal art to inspire you or connect you to yourself or represent something special to you, etc. There is value in that. You aren\u2019t being selfish - it\u2019s HARD on a body to be pregnant and give birth and the after math of all that. I encourage you to honor your body this way. Your body has done so much for your family, including for your husband. \n\nAnd I actually don\u2019t count buying clothes during/after pregnancy a selfish or frivolous expense. That\u2019s part of the cost of having a kid. You need to wear clothes that fit you to leave your house. It adds up, it\u2019s annoying, it\u2019s stressful, and then you continue to transition sizes/shape even more after the baby is here. It\u2019s a lot and the clothes are utilitarian. It\u2019s different from when you just splurged on an outfit for no reason. Your husband should respect and understand that. \n\nSo you have been extremely UNselfish with your body. If he\u2019s that worried about the cost, he can compromise and give up something so you can get your tattoo. That would be the UNselfish thing for him to do.  \n\nPS My friend thought tattoos were trashy, she only had dated clean cut men. Her husband decided he was going to get a tattoo (he knew her stance but she also firmly supported that it was his body, his choice, obviously she\u2019d love him regardless).

But the way she wrote it, it sounds like she already saved enough money for the tattoo, out of her money.\n\nAlso, frankly, there's a number of other things that bug me about the situation - okay, they contribute proportionately to income to household expenses, that's good.  But she's also providing full time care for her kid while working, and that isn't factored in?  This just doesn't sound equitable overall.\n\nEdit:  Removed the point about his tattoos since they were pre baby", "Can you quote the part of her submission where OP says his priorities are getting met?", "Came here to say this. Op is WFH full-time while also caring for an infant, so she's basically working 2 full-time jobs. Honest to God, I don't know how someone cares for their child while WFH, and actually gets anything done at the paid job. I've tried babysitting my 1 year old grandson a few times while WFH, and it was nearly impossible to focus on any of my work. I can't imagine the constant stress of trying to work and simultaneously mind a child all day every day.\n\nOP, I hope your husband realizes that by minding your own child, you're saving your family a shit ton of money in daycare expenses. When you view it in that light, your financial contribution is probably more than your husband's. \n\nhttps://www.care.com/c/how-much-does-child-care-cost/#child-care-cost says that for 2023, the average cost for infant daycare ranges from $128 to $417 per week, with the average being $284/week, so almost $15K a year. \n\nYou are NTA. As long as the bills are getting paid, you deserve to treat yourself after what you've gone through the last couple of years.", "I have my back, shoulders, upper chest and upper arms covered and I've never had an issue like you described. I worked as a bartender and was at work the day after. The only thing I wasn't able to do was wear a bra for a little over a week.", "I will answer this.  We have two full baths.  The one we bathe my son in was remodeled right before he was born.  Our master bath is just a little grungy, missing some caulking and starting to rust in a few places.  It isn\u2019t molding or dangerous in any way as of now.  It is definitely the next project in front of the countertops.  But we have not sat down and decided to put any amounts of money aside for either of these things yet.  I am ready and willing to do so.  I plan to contribute to both.  I just would like a little of my own money to spend on myself.", "I have no idea why there aren't more comments about this. Daycare can run between $600-$1500 per month. OP is working full time AND providing childcare. That deserves compensation of some kind.", "Probably trying to build an emergency fund.", "OP wrote that her husband has a bunch of tattoos but got them before they were married.", "I\u2019ll butt in here and say I do.  The artist is also a friend who could be charging me a lot more given her work.  I want to at least offer a 20% tip and leave it up to her if she wants to take it or not.", "It\u2019s selfish when it\u2019s 800 dollars and she doesn\u2019t pay as many bills or costs as her husband does. If she has money to pay for bills and a tattoo that\u2019s fine, but if it\u2019s one or the other and she still wants this tattoo OP is TA.", "OP updated their original post to say his tattoos were before they got married or had a baby. So pretty irrelevant to the topic at hand.", "Found the guy who thinks women only belong in the kitchen and isn't good at math", "Oh hush, OP works a full time job and take cares of the baby all day too instead of them both paying for daycare.", "It sounds like a nerve got poked by the tattoo needle.", "Juice, snacks, suckers and my playlist and/or mobile game. Take a break every 60-90 min to stretch, go outside and smoke or vape, potty then sit back down for another hour or so. Repeat.", "Based on financial income, by the way she explained it. Financial income does not account for money saved on full time daycare costs, she's probably saving them several hundred a week and it's not being accounted for in the splitting of finances", "You pulled that one straight out of your ass because it's not remotely what I said", "It way more than evens out. Don't undervalue yourself or the work you do to care for your child. 1 year's worth of child care is more than 10k (15k for center care, 35-50k for a nanny). I know you don't want to look at your partnership in these terms but you are providing more than 50% in your relationship. That doesn't even include the mental and emotional work you perform for your family.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t understand the PTO, and babysitter. Get it on the weekend, let dad watch the baby. It\u2019s a few hours.", "I am forgetful, sorry.  I didn\u2019t mean to mislead.  That is an important detail.", "Funny enit", "It's one thing to make an argument and be condescending in it, it's another thing to just hurl condescension/insults without any actual substance with it.", "A tattoo is not \u201cdrawing something on your body\u201d. \n\nOP said money was tight, but they were not struggling. Her husband is upset about what she\u2019s going to spend HER money on. They keep their finances separate. What she spends her money on, is really none if his concern. Do you think he\u2019s running his \u201cfrivolous\u201d spending by OP to get her opinion? He should be glad OP spoke to him about the tattoo in the first place. \n\nNow, I think taking PTO, and finding care for your baby are ridiculous to get a tattoo, when dad is there. Let him watch the baby, get it done in the evening or on your so day off. But if OP wants to use her PTO, there\u2019s obviously not a way for it to be \u201cbetter served\u201d.", "A tattoo is exactly drawing something on your body, what?", "That's pretty expensive for a tattoo.......  \n\nYes, getting rid of a health hazard is gonna take way more money.....so why spend that much money on just a want when you could be using that money to get rid of a health hazard faster.\n\nCan OP get herself a tattoo right now?  Yes.  Should she?  No.  Plenty of people lose their pregnancies and have another child without spending a shit load of money on a frivolous want while there's a health hazard in the house."]}
