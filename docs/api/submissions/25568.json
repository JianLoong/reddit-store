You're exactly right that they both need to learn that no means no, and you are free to be friendly with whomever you wish.

Short term with Jen. \n\n(Although i dunno if you guys have a future or what.  Still not 100% clear you did hook up but it seems that way due to the wording)\n\nBut honestly that was just a nice way of letting her down, even if it wasn't 100 percent honest.

That's twisted and you are under no obligation to hook up with or hang out with anyone period. \n\n>Liz starts telling me that we are both single and perfect for each other, but there was nothing to indicate that at all besides us both being black.\n\nThis is vile, though unfortunately not surprising. Straight people do it to gay people all the time, I had a friend who would constantly try to introduce me to every single gay woman she met until I finally snapped at her and asked if she wanted a friendship or a token gay. Let's just say we're not friends anymore. \n\nYou're 100% NTA Liz and Kelly are being toxic. Your race does not preclude you from wanting to interact with people of other races. Your gender does not guarantee that you will be responsive to the idea of a short term hook up. \n\nAside from that their argument that you're way too old for the other bridesmaid is bizarre for many reasons: 1. You're only 8 years older than her and while that might be a deal breaker for some I've seen plenty of age gap relationships with larger gaps that both partners are happy with. 2. You live across the country any hookup would've been short term so that idea of being in different stages in life/ power dynamics doesn't really come into play here bc it wouldn't have been a long term relationship anyway. 3. None of the behaviors/interactions you described felt overly sexual or romantic, I could be wrong but it sounded like you found someone to hangout with and have fun. 4. Unless Jen was a family who was invited to the bridal party due to familial obligation, she clearly is close enough to the bride to have and maintain a meaningful friendship with, so if she's mature enough to have a friendship with the bride (who I assume is around your age) then why isn't she mature enough to make her own decisions about who she hooks up with?\n\n>All is going well until when I am at the bar, Kelly and the Liz confront me and starts saying that me dancing with Jen is inappropriate.\n\n>I later find out from Tom that Kelly was crying her eyes out. And that it messed up the night for Liz as well.\n\nThis is a red flag too, it is Liz and Tom's wedding day, why TF is Liz paying attention to what you're doing? I've never been married but if I got married I'd 100% be focused on my wife not some friend who's mad she didn't get to smash. \n\nAnd if Kelly was the one to get Liz's attention and pull her away from her moment then SHE IS TA! Weddings are always, always, always about the couple being married, everyone else's drama can wait for the next business day.

Liz and Kelly seemed to think this was a date for you two and you were not to talk to or dance with anyone other than Kelly.

Jesus, why are some people obsessed with other people's sex lives? First, not everyone in a wedding party wants to hook up, and that should always be respected. Heck, everyone in my own wedding party are in serious, committed relationships!

This sounds possible racist/fetishy on their part, tbh. \n\nAlso, 32 and 25 really isn't that bad, especially if it was just a random hook up.

And unless there is some cultural thing we are missing, this is weird & out of line.Most of your duties ended at the church. Some minor ones carry over to reception (dances, speeches, etc) but even then, most of the bridal party will go back to their so/partners. It's not your duty/responsibility to become someone's date, without even being asked. Had a man done that to a woman, ppl would come unglued. The bride should have focused on the bride, not looking at you like a piece of meat for her friend. And so tf what if you just like white, we all have preferences. This is just messed up. They don't even care if you arent feeling it, they want you to play the part, regardless. That's so messed up.

Dating someone is not based on skin color except for racist people, no matter their skin color. \n\n\nKelly is the one who made Liz\u2019s wedding day miserable.

You have absolutely no obligation to find her attractive, dance with her, and certainly not to hook up with her. \n\nIf you and another bridesmaid hit it off, good for you. 24 is plenty old enough to decide you want to hook up at a wedding", "NTA for not falling for this premeditated trap.

I get wanting to set single friends up, but I'm kinda thinking that the bride is racist in thinking that she would setup you and Kelly and that you'd automatically hit it off because you share a skin color. The bride, groom and her friend all need professional help.  Their reactions to you wanting to hangout with Jen are ridiculous. They have no right to tell you what age is appropriate for you (as long as it's legal and consensual, it was only a few years ffs) nor who you can spend your time with.  Kelly clearly has some issues if she tries to call guys out on having a \"white fetish\"... I'll have to admit that's the first time I've heard that one.  Didn't realize that it was a bad thing to be attracted to a person for being that person and not the color of their skin. I've heard of black women having issues with black men dating white women and claiming they're stealing all the good black men which is ridiculous, but Kelly is a whole another level of crazy.

Later at the reception, one of her bridesmaids, half my age, sits next to me.  She offers to show me the nightlife in the town later.  A gracious offer.  My flight back is in the early morning.  I meet her at the club and it's a strip club and she is well-known there.  I think as a performer.  Anyway, got the $$$$ VIP treatment by a group of ladies and then a hotel room ensued.

(And we see cases of that a lot here in AITA.)\n\nOtherwise, I think the wider discussion of colorism, preference for Eurocentric features, and the way those and other factors affect dating patterns for Black people and other non-white groups is like... WAY beyond anything I should talk about, as a white woman.  I'm going to leave the discussion of those factors to any Black folks amongst the commenters (and I've seen at least one below).

She's making assumptions based on age and race. People do LTR all the time if they're compatible enough, and if Jen is in college she'll most likely have a choice of where to go after she graduates. \n\nKelly just had sour grapes and thought being 'paired' with a groomsman meant she was entitled to him. It's gross and I don't think it's necessary to excuse that just because she got rejected earlier in the proceedings. If the genders were reverse and a groomsman wouldn't take a hint or an explicit no, nobody would be saying \"We should see it from his perspective\" just because he was rejected.", ">As for the rest of your argument, Jesus - I'm not even going to bother\n\nHave you seen how many responses HoustonGradEngineer has replied to, i mean i know i should get a hobby but HoustonGradEngineer clings to their flawed narrative like red wine sofa stains", "Well, I've yet to see a post like this from a woman.

That's not OP or any individual's fault, it is what it is. Sometimes it manifests in people's \"preferences\" and they don't examine why that preference developed.\n\nSo, I get that being rejected \"for being in the wrong state\", and then seeing the person you wanted lied and is hitting on a younger white girl right in front of you is a lot.

Also, she was super in to me and had been discussing it with the bride and groom for some time but let\u2019s ignore that\u201d.

You're correct, no one expect her will ever really know, but the context of everything else seems to support this, including Kelly being possessive of him and upset he wasn't interested in her.  If OP doesn't seem to think the couple is racist then I will go with their judgement.  Only Kelly said anything actually racist when she was rejected, which is telling me OP dodged a major bullet too.", "If you know you know.", "I mean, I\u2019m Canadian(Caribbean) and grew up in a small town.

Either she is waaaaay more confident I am, or she's bought into the narrative that most men will sleep with any woman who is willing. Because if I am obviously hitting on someone I know is single and they aren't reciprocating, the LAST thing I need to know is why. That feels like it's basically asking, \"So, is it my looks, my personality, or both you aren't into?\"", "I agree more than you!", "It's not even a relationship, they were just hanging out together at a wedding reception.", "This!! And then to claim the night was ruined for Liz! That\u2019s her own fault for being so invested in Kelly. BUT: I think Kelly is the real asshole here for making her friend\u2019s wedding night about her. She insisted on attention from someone that wasn\u2019t interested instead of taking it on the chin like a champ and moving on. It\u2019s not fun to be rejected, and watching another person get picked over you would definitely add to that sting. Sure. However, she just met this guy, and it\u2019s her friends wedding night. Eat, drink, dance, and support your friend on her wedding night. That\u2019s all she needed to do. I think Kelly is the problem and Liz is contributing by enabling her/ too nice/ too naive and giving into Kelly\u2019s feelings. Liz let her night get ruined because she was trying to be a \u2018good friend\u2019 to someone lacking\u2026 self awareness? Propriety? Perspective, maybe. I feel bad for the husband too.

He was trying to let her down gently, which I don't remotely blame him for. He was going to be stuck with her for a large chunk of the next day. And irrational, horny, love-struck women can't seem to accept \"I'm just not attracted to you\". Kelly and Liz's instant leap to racism is kind of alarming and says a lot more about them and their attitudes towards others than it does about OP. OP went to a wedding, performed all duties that were asked of him, tried hard to be pleasant and civil to his somewhat crazy allocated partner for the day and then *gasp* actually tried to enjoy some of his friend's wedding day. Ffs - I can almost hear the bride shrilly screaming internally *how dare he do something that wasn't in* MY *plan on* MY *special day*!! \n\nOP NTA. Stay in touch with your buddy Tom. Refuse any further contact with his loony missus. And her delusional friends.", "He was trying to hook up with Jen though, which he says he did right after leaving the party", "Yeah. I mentioned the state thing because seeing him with the other woman probably revealed the lie.\n\nImagine you're a 30ish black woman at your good friend's wedding, the guy you wanted rejects you, and you see him flirting it up the next day with a younger white woman. \n\nShitty situation which has more to do with societal trends than any specific person.

Men get to have emotions and be hurt by rejection, too.  None of us know what was going on in Kelly\u2019s mind.  And most people I know would assume they were hooking up under these circumstances - it\u2019s just that no one would care, or probably even rooting for both of them.", "Yeah, it could have be Liz\u2019s idea. You also don\u2019t have to say outright racist things to be kinda racist. Hypothetically, if Liz was thinking, \u201cI can match my husband\u2019s black friend with my black friend!\u201d that would be super cringe.\n\nIf she thought OP was good for Kelly because he is black (color of his skin) versus the information she actually had from her husband on his type (someone about him as an individual), sorry, yeah, that\u2019s racist.", "This sounds like a normal traditional type thing, and not a you are now marrying this woman you just met because i say so.

Age and skin color probably didn't play a role in OP's choice but I bet the sense of connection and the quality of the treatment he got from Jen did. I've been in OP's shoes before and it's shitty of people to put that bullshit on you.", "Again, context.  OP said that she kept talking about how \"he was the kind of guy for her that she liked\" and \"you not doing hookup makes me like you even more\".  To me that says they looked up his info on Socials and decided.  I'm all for calling out racism, but I just don't see it here, except from Kelly.  It all screams 2 girls scheming to get a guy for one of them.", "What? \u2026 Where did she say anything racist?", "It's not racist when people want to date their people from their own culture. Please allow me to enlighten you a little on this: black women experience the most racism from black men, not white men if you can believe that. Colorism is the result of this. Black men accept racism from their preferences and their families more than you may think. \n\nWhite men will respect a black woman a little more than a black man because no demographic is as treasonous as black men. They have weaponized white women of all nationalities against black women to no end, and they're still doing it. It's weird that she's fixated on him at all, given she didn't know him beyond looks. However, black women are very race loyal and has always ended up with egg on our faces for it. \n\nShe thought he was a catch and got her feelings hurt because she had to face the hard truths that the men she is loyal to, aren't loyal to her and never have been.

Being stuck surrounded by monolingual anglophones drives me crazy at times, let alone the idea of living with a non-francophone (who probably wouldn't be able to put up with me either).\n\nJust saying that because sometimes these relationships are good, sometimes they can look from the outside like one partner *has* to assimilate into the surrounding culture where they may have preferred their partner would participate in theirs, more of a balance. It can be a lot more than just missing pop culture reference with those relationships and with bigger age gap ones too. Definitely other ways to end up out of step even with people in your age group from your native culture though!", "100% this", "This has to be fake.

I would have let the whole wedding know that Liz was trying to force me into a blind date with someone you have already declined romantically the evening before.", "Yeah yta. Why would you give excuses to Kelly instead of just stating you were not attracted to her?

What about Tom lol? If I was your buddy I'd be pissed and sorry sounds super awkward", "I've only been to a few weddings.  I've seen the BM/GM be coupled for like an entrance or certain things, but I've never heard of them having to spend the whole reception together.  That's beyond stupid.\n\nThe bride was purely trying to play matchmaker and failed.

I don't make any drama over it though. It's just a dance.", "I don't.

That's some gross 'stick to your own kind' shite.\n\nAnyway, NTA, obviously. Liz and Kelly have that sewn up.", "SIGH.\nAs a Black woman, I hate to see this. Sister Kelly is single and feeling some kind of way about herself and her singleness. Hoisting herself upon somebody who is very clearly giving her signs that they're not interested is a problem. The problem is further exacerbated by her taking it personally that you are not attracted to her, and that you found attraction with a younger Caucasian woman also in the wedding party. Like, this thing that we sometimes do where we decide that we get to police who other people are attracted to just because of racial solidarity is stupid.\nOP, NTA. I'm sorry this happened.", "Reminds me of one of those skits designed to tackle \"difficult topics\" where a white woman shows up to her boyfriends house and two black girls open the door and instantly start interrogating her/making her feel uncomfortable.
