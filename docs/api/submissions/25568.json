You're exactly right that they both need to learn that no means no, and you are free to be friendly with whomever you wish.

Short term with Jen. \n\n(Although i dunno if you guys have a future or what.

That's twisted and you are under no obligation to hook up with or hang out with anyone period. \n\n>Liz starts telling me that we are both single and perfect for each other, but there was nothing to indicate that at all besides us both being black.\n\nThis is vile, though unfortunately not surprising. Straight people do it to gay people all the time, I had a friend who would constantly try to introduce me to every single gay woman she met until I finally snapped at her and asked if she wanted a friendship or a token gay. Let's just say we're not friends anymore. \n\nYou're 100% NTA Liz and Kelly are being toxic. Your race does not preclude you from wanting to interact with people of other races. Your gender does not guarantee that you will be responsive to the idea of a short term hook up. \n\nAside from that their argument that you're way too old for the other bridesmaid is bizarre for many reasons: 1. You're only 8 years older than her and while that might be a deal breaker for some I've seen plenty of age gap relationships with larger gaps that both partners are happy with. 2. You live across the country any hookup would've been short term so that idea of being in different stages in life/ power dynamics doesn't really come into play here bc it wouldn't have been a long term relationship anyway. 3. None of the behaviors/interactions you described felt overly sexual or romantic, I could be wrong but it sounded like you found someone to hangout with and have fun. 4. Unless Jen was a family who was invited to the bridal party due to familial obligation, she clearly is close enough to the bride to have and maintain a meaningful friendship with, so if she's mature enough to have a friendship with the bride (who I assume is around your age) then why isn't she mature enough to make her own decisions about who she hooks up with?\n\n>All is going well until when I am at the bar, Kelly and the Liz confront me and starts saying that me dancing with Jen is inappropriate.\n\n>I later find out from Tom that Kelly was crying her eyes out. And that it messed up the night for Liz as well.\n\nThis is a red flag too, it is Liz and Tom's wedding day, why TF is Liz paying attention to what you're doing? I've never been married but if I got married I'd 100% be focused on my wife not some friend who's mad she didn't get to smash. \n\nAnd if Kelly was the one to get Liz's attention and pull her away from her moment then SHE IS TA! Weddings are always, always, always about the couple being married, everyone else's drama can wait for the next business day.

Liz and Kelly seemed to think this was a date for you two and you were not to talk to or dance with anyone other than Kelly.

Jesus, why are some people obsessed with other people's sex lives? First, not everyone in a wedding party wants to hook up, and that should always be respected. Heck, everyone in my own wedding party are in serious, committed relationships!

This sounds possible racist/fetishy on their part, tbh. \n\nAlso, 32 and 25 really isn't that bad, especially if it was just a random hook up.

And unless there is some cultural thing we are missing, this is weird & out of line.Most of your duties ended at the church. Some minor ones carry over to reception (dances, speeches, etc) but even then, most of the bridal party will go back to their so/partners. It's not your duty/responsibility to become someone's date, without even being asked. Had a man done that to a woman, ppl would come unglued. The bride should have focused on the bride, not looking at you like a piece of meat for her friend. And so tf what if you just like white, we all have preferences. This is just messed up. They don't even care if you arent feeling it, they want you to play the part, regardless. That's so messed up.

Dating someone is not based on skin color except for racist people, no matter their skin color. \n\n\nKelly is the one who made Liz\u2019s wedding day miserable.

The bride, groom and her friend all need professional help.  Their reactions to you wanting to hangout with Jen are ridiculous. They have no right to tell you what age is appropriate for you (as long as it's legal and consensual, it was only a few years ffs) nor who you can spend your time with.

Didn't realize that it was a bad thing to be attracted to a person for being that person and not the color of their skin. I've heard of black women having issues with black men dating white women and claiming they're stealing all the good black men which is ridiculous, but Kelly is a whole another level of crazy.

I meet her at the club and it's a strip club and she is well-known there.  I think as a performer.  Anyway, got the $$$$ VIP treatment by a group of ladies and then a hotel room ensued.

NTA, OP. Liz and Kelly are the AHs here and Liz is the one who ruined her own wedding night.", "Agreed. Liz ruined the day herself by getting both hers and Kelly's expectations up for nothing. \n\nAnd why do I get the feeling Liz was only in all of this for the wedding and not the marriage?", "Exactly... They're behaving in predatory behavior and then having the absolute GALL to call HIM the predator \ud83e\udd2f", "He should have acted charmed, dated her, proposed in a year, two tops, lived his life with a woman he is not in the least interested in, and take that secret to his grave. Anything less would be hella disrespectful to both Liz and Kelly /s", "Yep Tom knows his friend. He knows op doesn\u2019t like crazy women so op wouldn\u2019t like Kelly. \n\nKelly and Liz sound like best friends. Poor Tom.", "Yeah but that\u2019s not the bride and the bride might not have known about Kelly\u2019s stance on interracial relationships", "Preach!! I'm so glad OP turned her down though. Kelly was setting herself up for failure! I hope Jen and OP get together, let their preferences have them. It's obvious he didn't want Kelly solely because she is black (thank goodness). That has been the saving grace for a lot of us. I stay away from them as well, whether they like black women (they don't) or not. They aren't good for any race of women, but if they want them, please come take them ALL!! It'll behoove our women more than they realize, but I'm glad there are those of us waking up. But there are still those who are operating out of desperation for a black man. It breaks my heart.\n\nA black guy tried to hit on me at nearly 4:30 in the morning yesterday while I was getting gas. I'm wearing Hi-Vis, Dickies and boots, clearly headed to work. He pulls around to my side of the gas station after I thought he left asking, \" Can I park and ride with you?\" I shook my head no so fast and continued paying for my gas, while he stalled for a couple of seconds and then pulled off. No stank you, lol!!", ">And Kelly is a creep too, but picking on the creep still makes you the asshole\n\nAITA for picking on this creep \n\nI hope you respond with some more yummy dishonesty. Which is Ironic because you seem to not like OPs story and called OP dishonest then tried to win arguments with dishonesty. #WhoeverSmelledItDealtIt", "`He is in his 30's. He's not a teen. He had choices that were more polite. He should have known`\n\nHe did. he gave her a polite no which she did not accept.\n\n`But I clearly never defended the women, they were also wrong! I think it's easier to turn someone down than be turned down, so I forgive a mistake more easily on the more difficult end`\n\nAccepting a no isn't as hard as being interrogated for your decision especially as your decision where made on personal preferences. You are just making excuses for their bad behaviour. simple. \n\nyou except a no by ending the subject. you don't ask why. doing so means you haven't dropped the subject and will still pursue said subject.\n\n`OP flaunted his whole ass hookup affair in this girl's face.`\n\nHe did not do that. he told them I'm leaving and left. Jen left after. He/ they both did not flaunt a thing. making up more stuff to back your already loosing argument lol.\n\nhe did not make her cry she did that to herself. If she truly liked him she would not have insulted him.\n\n~~Was he STILL rude? Yes~~  after being interrogated, insulted and belittled was he EVER RUDE? **NO**\n\nHe was never rude, he never flaunted and wasn't insulting or pushy to either Kelly or the bride. Would you ever chastise a girl for saying she has a boyfriend to a dude who is being to pushy? I don't think so you would be to busy raging at the dude to even think about the woman's lie so stop being a hypocritical sexist and call out who's truly wrong.", "This is not the point.", "So why are you ignoring Kelly's behaviour and refusal to take no for an answer?\n\nDo you condone interrogative, amped up behaviour when people get rejected?", "This was my exact thoughts and I'm being down voted a lot lol. I have many family and friends in interracial relationships so I'm definitely not against interracial relationships but I've also witnessed similar language from black men who take issue with having any romantic connection with a black woman and this really just read like that. Not saying that I'm 100% correct as I don't know OP personally but self hate has been running rampant within our communities.", "Honey, \n\nDitto.", "Discrete? OP walked away from the situation. What more discretion could he have offered? If anything, Kelly (and Liz) were making a scene, not OP.", "Dude, it\u2019s not his fault that she was refusing his answer of no. No means no, and didn\u2019t require any further elaboration", "False. His first issue came up when this whole plan was created by the bride. the second issue was Kelly not accepting no so he was interrogated. His third was when he got dirty looks for dancing. his fourth was when he was at the bar and they both grilled, insulted and belittled him for saying no. The only time he actually never had an issue was when he left and being in the company of Jen probably made his bad night better.", "Right? She was crying her eyes out over a guy she JUST MET?!?! This wasn't a situation where here marriage was falling apart or she caught her fiancee cheating on her - a guy she just met was not into her, so she cried like a baby and ruined her friends wedding. That's completely unhinged behavior, and none of it is on OP.", "I too check the group chat while hooking up....", "Sure would be nice if he didn't feel the need to lie about it saying he isn't into short term when he clearly is.", "Thank god!", "Meaning all these folks weren\u2019t allowed to bring a plus one because they were all on A BLIND DATE at a wedding!", "Yeah, it's half your age plus seven. Those are the rules for determining it being creepy in a relationship, everyone knows that?", "Honestly 24 year old me and 29 year old me are basically the same.\n\nI doubt that will ever change though. Child at heart and everything.", "I get the feeling the the whole not living in the same state was more along the lines of a little white lie.", "Except Kelly was clearly looking for a committed relationship. That's why OP told her if wouldn't work. Other chick probably just wanted to hook up with someone at a wedding like OP clearly wanted to.", ">So, it's more likely that Liz is racist rather than Liz thinking OP is exactly what Kelly wants in a guy. \n\nBoth can be true.", "> Maybe none of the other bridesmaids liked any of the guys.\n\nWell, Jen sure seemed to.", "Same, and I mostly did it in jest to begin with.  Never again.", "I was at a wedding that had a guncle table. The bride and groom put their guncles at one table. Both had their husbands as dates and are outgoing guys married to much more reserved guys so they hoped all the guncles would get along even though there was a 20-year age gap. The two more reserved husbands are both into community activitism and sort of force themselves into being outgoing at events and spent most of the night talking.\n\nThey laid a friend trap and it worked. Success!\n\nI noticed the seating arrangement and laughed. They straight up made a gay uncle table. To be fair, it wasn't 'put the gay bros together' but, 'you know they're all active in the LGBTQ+ community and the husbands have really similar vibes and they would probably get along they have things in common.' They were trying to get people to talk and mingle. It worked.", "Yeah exactly - playing cupid with the seating plan is fine, anything beyond that is not", "Yes but also no - OP wasn't doing anything with Jen other than texting her (which nobody else knew about unless that was left out of the post) and dancing at the reception. He didn't express any intention to date Jen, either to Jen or to other people, nor to us in his post.\n\nI agree there are cultural factors at play, but it isn't fair to make OP individually responsible for those factors. OP can dance with who he likes (and date who he likes for that matter) and being hurt that he had better chemistry with someone outside his race, out of the two specific people who he interacted with, and then making that hurt someone else's problem isn't snt fair. That's something Kelly needs to address herself. (She may also just need to work on handling rejection in general. It happens to literally everybody.)\n\nAnd it's DEFINITELY none of Liz's business.", "But didn\u2019t you read, Kelly\u2019s black too! It\u2019s **perfect**\u2026. Get Out vibes or something, tbh.", "Sounds like Liz had been talking up OP and had Kelly completely sold on the fact that they were going to have some romcom meetcute at the wedding\u2026\n\nDoesn\u2019t make Kelly any less crazy for making a scene, of course.  Just a guess at why.", "But to leave the wedding you are an attendant at early to hook up? Not cool. Hope Liz is mad at Jen too", "I disagree. This is none of Liz's business.", "He might've really connected with Jen - we don't know.", "Sure would be nice if someone wasn't pressured to the point where they felt like a lie was their only way out. He got backed into a corner. If the genders were switched and a guy pressured a girl like that, I bet you wouldn't bat an eye", "The most I've ever heard of was pairing bridesmaids and groomsmen to walk down the aisle then split to their respective sides. And if the marrying couple are close, it's not unusual for the bride's brother[s] to be groomsmen or the groom's sister[s] to be bridesmaids, who tend to be pairs... this is not Alabama.", "I think by the time someone is 24/25 it\u2019s fine. They\u2019re an adult and have experienced adult things by then", "Someone making that up doesn't make it a rule", "Most people do a lot of maturing in the first year after college when they are finally \"on their own\".", "The difference between me at 24 and me at 29 is minor.\n\n- a little more generally relaxed\n- more money\n- more professional experience \n\nPersonality wise pretty much the same", "And if Kelly accepted his first rejection instead of pushing it, he wouldn't have even needed the lie", "Me too. So if OP tells Kelly \"oh, I'm only into long term things and you don't live in my state\" and then goes and hooks up with Jen anyway... I can see why Kelly got hurt, and why Liz was upset on her behalf. \n\nOP's still not the asshole, but I don't think anyone in the story is crazy or racist.", "No, OP said \"I end up saying that I don\u2019t do the whole short term type thing\". He said it wouldn't work because Kelly lives in a different state.", "It still could have been.  Kelly probably saw or heard about OP and asked to be partnered up with him. Online dating is just going off of pictures. Also could have been a blind date type thing. \n\nI know I am sometimes attracted to my friends friends who I never met but just see from social media. I think Kelly and Liz planned for them to be together.  That isn't even abnormal.  What happened after the pairing was.", "OP only got invited because Kelly wanted him there (and they were scratching around for more groomsmen).", "Idk the guncle table sounds like a cool place", "Yeah, I mean to say Kelly sobbing probably had little to do with OP himself. OP isn't the asshole (although he probably should've not created drama in the wedding party, and not ignored the bride's dirty looks initially).\n\nBut if you put yourself shoes in the shoes of a 30ish black woman who has just gotten rejected at her good friend's wedding for a significantly younger white woman, it's easy to understand why she was sobbing. That is a socially complex layered situation.", "Either way is creepy and predatory.", "It's...idk if I wanna call it racist if she prefers to date black men, especially given the racism they are much more likely to encounter from white men and their families.\n\nBut it's weird if she fixated on OP for that reason. He's far from the only black man in the world.\n\nMy money is with the \"she crushed on him bc she saw a picture\" crowd.", "Dude, my dad was racist and raised me racist, but I realized he\u2019s completely wrong about it. That\u2019s not our culture, it\u2019s racism.", "You're claiming that a 24 year old is too young to go out with a 32 year old. That's treating the 24 year old as a child instead of as a fully grown adult.", "AITA try not to blatantly lie to make arguments that suit their agenda (impossible)", "He didn't leave to hook up. He left to avoid the drama. And then Jen followed a bit later. It's not as if he went \"I'm off - Jen, come on, let's fuck\".", "Ok thnx for clarifying this. So the bride was being a creep and was trying to pimp OP out to her friend.", "It really sounds like Liz and Kelly started shipping OP/Kelly way before the ceremony and Kelly already had the wedding dress half-bought. Very stalkerish behavior.", "This. I\u2019m in an age-gap marriage. Seven years is nothing.", "I think kelly crying and the wife accusing OP of ruining her wedding, all because he wouldn\u2019t hook up with her friend, is pretty crazy. In the reverse if a groom accused a bridesmaid of ruining his wedding because she wouldn\u2019t blow a groomsman there wouldn\u2019t be any question he was crazy.", "He told that the Kelly to get her to back off. He was trying to be nice.", "Or the much more likely thing happened and her friend thought \"hey I have a black friend, and another black friend, they should date\"", "Must have missed that part.", "Agreed.", "I don't have an agenda, although I did back up every one of my assumptions. Sorry if you disagree.", "Yes! Pimping him out! Perfect way to put it.", "Yes, exactly. None of this is normal behavior, at all.", "Everyone was pretty reasonable when OP rejected Kelly initially. The drama started when he went for another bridesmaid. \n\nMaybe OP should've thought ahead and decided not to create drama in the wedding party, especially if he's allegedly not into short term things.\n\n> After a bit, I go to the bar and Jen and I start to dance. At this point Kelly is giving me dirty looks. I just ignore it and continue having a good time. \n\nI'm not going to call OP the asshole for it, but if a bride is giving you dirty looks at her wedding, don't ignore it.", "Yeah you backed them up with blatant lies", "Holy hell Batman there\u2019s a lot for you to unpack here.", "Her dirty looks are because he didn\u2019t hook up with her friend and danced with someone else. He didn\u2019t make a scene, he didn\u2019t get drunk. He danced at a wedding with someone who he wanted to dance with and whom wanted to dance with him.

Do you not know what words mean, and how to tell context from the post? Buzz off with your own agenda, I can't be bothered to care", "Well no, he says that he was hitting it off with Jen. He wasn't dancing with someone random, he was flirting with a bridesmaid right after rejecting another bridesmaid. \n\nPeople aren't blind, they can see when people are flirting.
