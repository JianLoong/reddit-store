I was not into her at all so I kindly turned her down. She then starts interrogating me as to why, I try to give a generic answer but she starts listing off all of the reason why we are so perfect together.  I end up saying that I don\u2019t do the whole short term type thing and as we both live in completely different states there is no future here. She ends up cooling off but then tells me that she respects me more for that and that I am a stand up guy, and the type of guy that she is looking for.\n\n  \nDuring the rest of the time we are there, one of the other \u2018unmatched\u2019 bridesmaids (call her Jen) starts messaging me privately and we hit it off. The next day wedding ceremony goes well, we have the reception and me and Kelly do our entrance together and then dance together for a bit. After a bit, I go to the bar and Jen and I start to dance. At this point Kelly is giving me dirty looks. I just ignore it and continue having a good time.  \n\n\nAll is going well until when I am at the bar, Kelly and the Liz confront me and starts saying that me dancing with Jen is inappropriate. They start saying she is too young for me that it looks creepy. (FWIW I am 32 and she is 24 about to turn 25). I am like oh it\u2019s okay me and Jen are just friends. Liz at this point is angry with me and starts saying that Jen is in college (She is doing her Masters) and that this is her wedding and she doesn\u2019t want to see that. Then Kelly starts saying that I must have a fetish for White women. At this point I realize that there is no logical argument I can make.\n\n  \nI tell Kelly and Liz that I really enjoyed the wedding but I need to go to bed early for my flight the next day. I leave and go up to my hotel. 15 minutes later Jen leaves early.  5 minutes after Jen came up, we both get kicked out of the wedding party chat.\n\n  \nI later find out from Tom that Kelly was crying her eyes out. And that it messed up the night for Liz as well. He told me that he isn\u2019t mad at me because he told Liz from the start that Kelly isn\u2019t going to be my type, but instead Liz really wanted to set Kelly up. At this point I feel terrible that I made it so Liz was not able to enjoy her special night, as for Kelly I just wish she got no means no.", "created_utc": 1693077668, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16241qc/aita_for_ditching_my_assigned_bridesmaid_at_a/", "score": 638, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just like Kelly.", "NTA YOU didn't make it so Liz could not enjoy her night. She did that, thinking she had the right to dictate to you about your life and choices. Don't feel bad, except maybe for Tom, sounds like he just signed onto a very bad deal.", "It seems like you found yourself in a complex situation at the wedding, and it's understandable that you're seeking perspective on it. Let's break down the different aspects of the situation:  \nAssigned Bridesmaid: It's unfortunate that you felt you were assigned a bridesmaid based on race rather than compatibility. It's important to approach such situations with sensitivity and open communication. If you felt uncomfortable with this, it could have been a good idea to discuss it with the bride and groom beforehand.  \nInteractions with Kelly: You handled the situation respectfully by turning down Kelly's advances and explaining your reasons. However, she seemed to have taken it personally, and that's something you can't control. It's important to communicate your boundaries, but also to be understanding of others' feelings.  \nConnecting with Jen: It's natural to form connections with people at events like weddings. If you hit it off with Jen and both of you were enjoying each other's company, that's not inherently wrong. Age differences can be a consideration, but it ultimately depends on the individuals involved and their comfort levels.  \nConfrontation with Kelly and Liz: The confrontation at the bar seems to have been fueled by miscommunication and emotions running high. Kelly and Liz might have had their own reasons for feeling uncomfortable, even if they weren't expressing them in the most rational way.  \nLeaving the Wedding Early: While it's unfortunate that Kelly and Liz were upset, you were within your right to decide to leave the wedding early if you felt uncomfortable or if the situation was escalating. Taking care of your own well-being is important.  \nReflection: It's good that you've reflected on the situation and acknowledged the feelings of others. It sounds like you're empathetic toward Kelly's perspective and regret the unintended impact on Liz's enjoyment of her special day.  \nIn summary, it's a complex situation with emotions on all sides. While you didn't handle everything perfectly, you acted respectfully and within your own boundaries. Misunderstandings and emotions sometimes create tense situations, and it's important to remember that everyone involved likely had their own perspectives and feelings. It might be a good idea to reach out to Tom and Liz to express your regret for any unintended impact and to maintain open communication moving forward.", "So your friend knew you didn\u2019t like black women and his wife set up a black women for you regardless. \ud83d\ude44 the wife is wrong to put her friend in that situation. Go enjoy your white women", "I think this is a lot more complex than people realise and Kelly probably had a point about the white girl thing ...", "ESH, \n\nLiz and Kelly were completely in the wrong for trying to hook you up at the wedding (especially for their justification as to why) and getting mad when you hit it off with someone else (especially fetishizing your rational).\n\nThat said, having Jen 'come up' so soon after your interaction with the Liz and Kelly was insensitive (especially after saying you 'don\u2019t do the whole short term type thing'). Trading contacts with Jen and seeing if something developed after the wedding would have been appropriate.", "NAH as you are free to like who you like. But it also sounds like you automatically didn't like your assigned bridesmaid because she was black and that kind of makes YTA.", "NTA/ESH. You\u2019re NTA for the question asked. Bridesmaids and Groomsmen are there to support the couple, not become the next bride and groom. You are not each others dates to the wedding.\n\nBut ESH in general because while I don\u2019t know if you have a white girl fetish, taking issue or note with being paired with a black woman is absolutely anti-black. \n\nIf we agree that a groomsmen and bridesmaid are simply serving their wedding party duty, then what\u2019s the issue with being paired with another black person? Why is it so unreasonable to be paired with her? \n\nIf you were paired with any of the white women you wouldn\u2019t have had an issue or given it a second thought. But you get the black bridesmaid and now race is the only possible reason why you could be assigned.", "OP why wasn\u2019t Kelly your type? Because without further context, it looks like your type is younger white women, which would understandably upset Kelly who already deals with a smaller dating pool because of this.", "It wasn\u2019t your wedding so I\u2019m going with YTA. Both you and Jen. You could have waited until the wedding was over. You\u2019re NTA for being interested in Jen over Kelly. They most certainly overreacted in the fact that you weren\u2019t interested in Kelly", "I\u2019m only saying a soft YTA because you lied to Kelly and told her you weren\u2019t looking for a short term thing, and then showed interest in another bridesmaid. That\u2019s confusing and hurtful, like what\u2019s wrong with me, obviously not good enough.

Short term with Jen. \n\n(Although i dunno if you guys have a future or what.  Still not 100% clear you did hook up but it seems that way due to the wording)\n\nBut honestly that was just a nice way of letting her down, even if it wasn't 100 percent honest.

That's twisted and you are under no obligation to hook up with or hang out with anyone period. \n\n>Liz starts telling me that we are both single and perfect for each other, but there was nothing to indicate that at all besides us both being black.\n\nThis is vile, though unfortunately not surprising. Straight people do it to gay people all the time, I had a friend who would constantly try to introduce me to every single gay woman she met until I finally snapped at her and asked if she wanted a friendship or a token gay. Let's just say we're not friends anymore. \n\nYou're 100% NTA Liz and Kelly are being toxic. Your race does not preclude you from wanting to interact with people of other races. Your gender does not guarantee that you will be responsive to the idea of a short term hook up. \n\nAside from that their argument that you're way too old for the other bridesmaid is bizarre for many reasons: 1. You're only 8 years older than her and while that might be a deal breaker for some I've seen plenty of age gap relationships with larger gaps that both partners are happy with. 2. You live across the country any hookup would've been short term so that idea of being in different stages in life/ power dynamics doesn't really come into play here bc it wouldn't have been a long term relationship anyway. 3. None of the behaviors/interactions you described felt overly sexual or romantic, I could be wrong but it sounded like you found someone to hangout with and have fun. 4. Unless Jen was a family who was invited to the bridal party due to familial obligation, she clearly is close enough to the bride to have and maintain a meaningful friendship with, so if she's mature enough to have a friendship with the bride (who I assume is around your age) then why isn't she mature enough to make her own decisions about who she hooks up with?\n\n>All is going well until when I am at the bar, Kelly and the Liz confront me and starts saying that me dancing with Jen is inappropriate.\n\n>I later find out from Tom that Kelly was crying her eyes out. And that it messed up the night for Liz as well.\n\nThis is a red flag too, it is Liz and Tom's wedding day, why TF is Liz paying attention to what you're doing? I've never been married but if I got married I'd 100% be focused on my wife not some friend who's mad she didn't get to smash. \n\nAnd if Kelly was the one to get Liz's attention and pull her away from her moment then SHE IS TA! Weddings are always, always, always about the couple being married, everyone else's drama can wait for the next business day. If your feelings are hurt you suck it up and put on a brave face or excuse yourself.

Liz sounds a nightmare, Kelly needs therapy. I mean the whole situation is absurd.

You performed the duties you were assigned with Kelly.  You walked in with her and danced with her.  Liz and Kelly seemed to think this was a date for you two and you were not to talk to or dance with anyone other than Kelly.

Jesus, why are some people obsessed with other people's sex lives? First, not everyone in a wedding party wants to hook up, and that should always be respected. Heck, everyone in my own wedding party are in serious, committed relationships!

This sounds possible racist/fetishy on their part, tbh. \n\nAlso, 32 and 25 really isn't that bad, especially if it was just a random hook up.

And unless there is some cultural thing we are missing, this is weird & out of line.Most of your duties ended at the church. Some minor ones carry over to reception (dances, speeches, etc) but even then, most of the bridal party will go back to their so/partners. It's not your duty/responsibility to become someone's date, without even being asked. Had a man done that to a woman, ppl would come unglued. The bride should have focused on the bride, not looking at you like a piece of meat for her friend. And so tf what if you just like white, we all have preferences. This is just messed up. They don't even care if you arent feeling it, they want you to play the part, regardless. That's so messed up.

But is definitely not your fault or problem. You where ambushed by the bride and her friend in hopes that she could finally find a good man. the fact that she did not have a date already at the wedding tells you everything you need to know. at her age if she does not have a partner she's never going to get one you did the absolutely right thing by avoiding nothing but damaged goods. Move forward with your life and wish the couple nothing but happiness and don't worry about this", "NTA. \n\nThere are certainly many legit reasons why Kelly is still single in her very late 20s early 30s (I suppose she is closer in age to you as she is upset you are interested in a 25 yo woman). \n\n\nShe also is racist. Dating someone is not based on skin color except for racist people, no matter their skin color. \n\n\nKelly is the one who made Liz\u2019s wedding day miserable. Liz was clearly made aware by her husband Kelly would not be your type as being black is not a type, she insisted for you two to date even after you made it clear it would not be an option. \n\nIf the situation was reversed and a black man tried to force a black woman to date him, people would be more than upset. \n\nI really dislike double standard. \n\n\nKelly and Liz are full of BS and stereotypes.

And Kelly is a creep too, but picking on the creep still makes you the asshole. They're not in high school anymore. He can manage to be truthful and kind even if someone is being a bit pushy. That's a friend of a friend. It's not asking much to manage to not absolutely crush her. But also maybe the bride had something to do with these unrealistic expectations. Obviously the groom knew and told the bride better. It's a shame any of this happens, but you're not getting me to give OP a pass. Want to know what people would say about Kelly hooking up with a random young college boy if the roles were reversed? Yeah. That's what I thought. Guy could have kept it in his pants for ONE NIGHT.

Maybe someone else was also set-up and OP wasn't aware.", "It\u2019s a yikes either way. You don\u2019t have to reverse the genders. It\u2019s icky and creepy either way.", "What? It sounds like you do agree? What do you disagree with?", "Hahaha you're hilarious. He said no, that should have been the end of it. He's allowed to do what he wants after that, as is Jen.

I feel that would have bummed her out too maybe leading to her getting just as mad. He went for the white lie to try and save her ego a little bit. But if you are for the truth as unappealing as it might be for the receiver then ok, that's a stance you can take.", "Yeah I assume they hooked up too. Which is fine. It's their business and none of Kelly's and Liz's.", "He says in a comment that he felt that he had to lie to her because she wasn't backing off when he said no.

It was pretty fucking uncomfortable to be treated that way while men get to flaunt their indiscretions because \"they can do what they want.\" I am grown now.

That should be the end of.\n\n\n\n>An almost 25 year old and a 32 year old can make their own decisions.\n\nAnd his decision was to hurt someone in his social circle because they had the audacity to ask him some questions. That makes him the AH in my book. You got a problem with someone being a creep? Then use your principles, and say so. Don't fucking lie about your principles, and then flaunt it. Even if I didn't feel bad for Kelly, that STILL makes OP look like shit. Don't you get it?", ">OP danced at a party with multiple partners which is a normal thing. \n\nOP was gotten onto by the bride. What he was doing was, apparently, not normal dancing.

But he wasn't prepared to keep up his ruse, though. Too bad.", "I've actually never heard of it really.", "No. Typically you're paired during the ceremony for photos & to walk in. Different brides & grooms set it up differently, most common being pairing the tallest bridesmaid with the tallest groomsmen (assuming that no one knows the other). My husband and I just said \"pair up, figure out who has responsibilities during the ceremony, otherwise we don't care\". But there is nothing that requires pairing after the grand entrance to the reception, and everyone intermingles at that point", "Not that I've ever heard, either.  Pairing up bridesmaids and groomsmen to walk down the aisle together / stand in a certain order on either side of the bride and groom (and in photos), yeah, of course.  Often people will be matched by height, sometimes age; anything else I'd side-eye (like putting the two black people together).   And if the main table is really big, it can dictate who is sitting with whom.  \n\nBut apart from procession / standing during the ceremony / photos?  NOPE.  That's not a thing, and it shouldn't be.

I think specifically so that I'd have someone matched with me who was my age, my brother picked my same-age cousin as a groomsman.  Looking back on it, it was very kind of them to include me!  And kind to include my cousin; but it helped because he and I were matched in age and height.  Anyway, I spent like no time at all with him; we got along fine, but weren't close.)", "Not necessarily.

You can't reasonably deny it.", ">You're assuming he didn't.\n\nI'm not stupid, and neither is the bride. They're not mad that someone danced at a wedding. In fact, early on in meeting, couples are not always supposed to be up each other's asses. Everyone is more likely mad because this guy flagrantly hooked up with someone different after lying. At least, from my end, I could understand. If I notice someone giving extra attention to someone on the dance floor, and they dip out to a hotel... Well, I'm not stupid. Neither is anyone else there. I could understand them being mad. But you're right, they might have been equally awful in any other scenario. They certainly seem to be a bit pushy.\n\n>No, no she didn't. She kept pestering him for a why. That's not accepting the \"no\". \n\n\nShe said that she was actually happy with not going for casual, after she got her answer. I'll admit that asking for a why several times is overly pushy, but it's not the same as being unwilling to take a no or being unwilling to have the guy dance with multiple partners at a wedding."]}
