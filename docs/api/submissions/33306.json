In the post you admit you got along during the wedding and I\u2019m assuming the planning as well, if she reciprocated that train of thought, she probably has been thinking everything was fine between you two until she found out about the lie.\n\nYou *were* justified to exclude her, but you should have established boundaries and had the courage to tell her that rather than keep it all a secret.\n\nEDIT: Apparently you have a history of keeping things from her. Yikes.\n\nEDIT again: Lol, so apprently excluding her was never justified after all, you just \u201cdon\u2019t get along\u201d yeah sorry buddy, thats not a good reason. Sounds like you and your parents just hate your sister.", "Why did you put lying in quation marks? That's exactly what you did. You and your parents have been lying to her for years.\n\nN T A for excluding your sister, it was your wedding and you can decide who you want, but YTA for not having the courage to tell her and also getting your parents and family to support you in the lie.", "YTA for lying, you and your horrible parents\n\nand then you go on to say you do this all the time to her\n\npart of being an adult is having hard conversations\n\ntbh, this sounds more like you were the golden child and your extended family knows that you keep lying to your sister\n\ni mean, really?", "YTA and so is mom. Issues are mentioned ok, and that you don\u2019t get along but how about telling us what the problem is, there\u2019s no specifics of any kind.  We we\u2019ve got to take your word for having good reason, or any basis, to exclude sister.  You\u2019re an AH, more concerned about who spilled the beans instead of facing the fact that you\u2019ve done exactly the kind despicable and dishonest drama creation that you\u2019re complaining  about.  This is all a giant projection which makes you and mom AHs", "YTA strictly for the lying. Lies are always found out and they always turn into a bigger mess than it needed to if you'd just take care of business to begin with. Don't want to deal with sister and her drama, then tell her. She'll explode and everyone can block her and move on. Lie about it and now she's pretty much got the high ground family wise.", "YTA for lying. Boundary\u2019s are good, and your sister is entitled to feeling betrayed because you all lied.", "LOL you are being so vague about what issues you and Amy had that it is pretty clear that you are looking for validation. YTA\n\nYour getting called out rightfully for not being clear on what the issues are and tbh. It is pretty clear that you knew what you were doing and so did your parents and the fact that youve done this before says alot about the three of you than it does about Amy. \n\nThe fact that your family is calling you and your parents out for favouritism says alot as awell.", "YTA. From your comenta it sounds like Amy really hasn\u2019t done anything wrong you are just the golden child who was better than her in yours and your parents eyes", "YTAs for lying. Set a boundary, don't invite her - all fine, but don't lie. Grow a spine.", "Yta, I\u2019m gunna side with everyone else in your life who knows your relationship and called out the favouritism. \n \nYou shouldn\u2019t have lie and hid a family bonding  moment", ">For background - My younger sister Amy and I have never really gotten along.

YTA\n\nEdit: read your comments and you and your parents are AH.", "If you and a few friends had spent the morning together and excluded your sister it could be excused as well it was close friends only. But you invited everyone up to and including your grandmother and deliberately did not invite Amy. It must have been quite a job to keep the sister in the dark on the day of the wedding as to where every female relative and or friend was.  This was mean and unnecessary and you your mother your grandmother and your friends and everyone who lied to your sister are giant AH.  YTA", "N T A for not including her. YTA for including other female family members and thinking you could hide it from her, for lying and for getting other people to lie for you.", "So you don't like your sister fine, but it was not only lying to her you included your entire family in the lie and that makes YTA. You say she's angry but I be she's actually really upset. Do you have any empathy at all about how she's probably now questioning her relationship with her whole family, wondering about how many times shes been lied to and feeling that that everyone hates her - right before Christmas as well. Yet some how think you are better than her, she may be a drama queen but she's not deliberately cruel.  The fact that the rest of your family are calling you and your parents out for this behaviour suggests you are in the wrong and this favouritism isn't an isolated incident.", ">My parents and I have been called horrible names and have been told that we lied to Amy and should be ashamed of ourselves.\n\nSpot on mate. YTA", "YTA", "YTA (and your parents) for keeping it a secret. Nothing wrong with excluding her but you should have been up front about it, and it sure does make it sound like you were the favourite too given that your parents went along with it.", "You are the ah for lying. You purposely hid it from her. You should have told her. \n\nAnd your comments just makes it worse. You and your parents seem to have pattern of doing this. No wonder your relationship is shit.\n\nYTA", "I dont understand why you didn't tell Amy. Her not being part of your wedding morning is fine. You guys are not close. But having this elaborate scheme to lie, having your parents involved to lie, is just really shady. There was no need for it. You guys are all adults and acting like high school mean girls. You should have told Amy up front, and she could just deal with it then.\nThe fact that this isn't the first time you have done this to Amy is why you are the AH. Your friend, who was a part of your scheme, told Amy. This leads me to believe your friend felt guilty and after seeing how poorly Amy is treated by her own family. That wedding secret is just the tip of the iceberg. That's hurtful to Amy that you all were in on this scheme to not tell her. She obviously can't trust her parents as they seem to be far up your ass.\nIt sounds like you're the golden child in your family.\nYTA", "YTA and so are your parents, particularly your mother.\n\nBy your own admission you got along with your sister, but weren\u2019t great friends.  So it was a period in your lifetime where your relationship was at least decent, but you treated her like it wasn\u2019t. \n\nJust as a data point, is your sister married? How did she treat you during her wedding? And what was your relationship like at that time?\n\nAs for your mother, I can\u2019t believe that she would treat her daughter like this. I am a mother myself, and I would never betray my daughter in such a fashion. I can only imagine what else your sister has had to deal with. And what about her grandson? He now knows this is the way his family treats his mother, and by extension him. Can only imagine what he thinks of his grandparents now.\n\nThrow out this entire family. Amy, you and your son are welcome to come to my house for Christmas.\n\nEdit: OPs comments make this so much worse. OP is clearly the golden child, clearly mistreated sister because she was different growing up, not the only time sister has been lied to, family doesn\u2019t believe in lies of omission. YTA is not strong enough.", "NTA. In fact you were entirely in the right. Your sister and her backup tantrum artists are in the wrong.\n\nGiven that you and your sister weren't close at the time of the wedding, it was reasonable to not include her. The quality of the relationship just wasn't there.\n\nNot telling her about the events she wasn't invited to was simply good manners and damage control. It's rude to discuss social events with, or on front of, people who aren't invited. Reactions like this are one reason why.\n\nThe extended family members who are criticizing you and your parents, and extended family members, may not know what Amy is like. They are definitely allowing themselves to be manipulated. But the fact she's whipping up drama and pulling in third parties *years* after the supposed slight is evidence that she wasn't mature enough to be invited at the time and probably isn't now.", "NTA has she spent 10 years thinking you spent your morning of wedding prep in complete silence on your own? This isn't something you ever had to tell her bc it's so obvious?", "NTA -The fact that Amy\u2019s making such a big deal about this years later shows exactly why she needed to be excluded in order to have a drama free wedding morning.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You all owe your sister a sincere apology for lying by omission.  You have an explanation but not an excuse.  This was cruel.  It was a betrayal.  You have all done her a great disservice by not being honest at the time of the wedding.\nYou could have been honest and simply stated that you were reserving the morning for those closest and you would see her later.  It would have stung, but not nearly as much as lying through omission.\n\nTrust is a very delicate thing.  It will probably be years before trust is repaired.  You and your parents need to own this.

That's why most people learn, usually around elementary school, that they need to follow social standards if they want to be included. For whatever reason, your sister's high maintenance behavior is making it hard for you to be close to her. The family, and the individuals in it, have two choices: allow the difficult person to set the standards, or create as much distance as is needed to prevent her antics from affecting you.\n\nAmy not engaging on these antics would be a great option too, yet only Amy controls her behavior. She's long past the age where she can be wrangled into civilized conduct, so if she will not govern herself, exclusion is the result.", "Oh, please, OP. You're a coward. The lying was totally unnecessary. Being shady af to get everyone to lie wasn't needed. You guys weren't close, so even internet strangers understand she wouldn't be invited to your shitty wedding. You were just too chicken shit to tell her to her face.\n\nIt's not about being excluded from the wedding, but you and her own parents acting like mean girls and making an elaborate plan to lie to her. This is what is actually hurtful.\nIt's hurtful because you admit you and your family have done this before to Amy. Amy seems to be the one that gets picked on and bullied by the family.", "Lol you might want to check the comment histories of the people agreeing with you. Their support not the mic drop you think it is", "That\u2019s a fair point as well.

It seems to be passive aggressive at best, which isn\u2019t a good way to handle anything.", "Exactly, and I would guess Amy is questioning what else has been held back from her and a huge disconnect from family. My parents made a choice not to share a medical issue one of them had with me years ago. They then placed that expectation on my two siblings. Sucky thing to do. Only one parent is alive so I don't even tackle it because in my mind it should be both of them I express betrayal to. \n\nI don't trust any of them any longer, except my brother's wife who told me. Amy shouldn't either. OP and family are TAH's because the least you could have done was be honest. 'Leaving things out benefits the person making that decision. The person who just doesn't want to deal with it.'", "listen OP is lawyer she is the smartest person in the world /s", "LOL this isnt something that justifies lying to her though.

I re read the post a couple times and OP is very skint with the details and seemingly looking for validation.", "Yeahhhh, what are the chances here that this is a self-fulfilling prophecy where: 1.

Amy finds out and is angry; 4. everyone says \u201cwell if you didn\u2019t get so angry and cause so much drama, we\u2019d invite you!\u201d; 5. rinse, repeat. Maybe Amy is a trouble-making pain in the ass, but there\u2019s no actual evidence in the post; AND, if she is, excluding her teaches her nothing about the consequences of her behavior! If she\u2019s truly so awful, tell her that she needs to make meaningful, lasting changes if she wants to be included. As it\u2019s been told, this story doesn\u2019t make sense.", "OP said this in a response to me take it for what it is I still dont see how its a justification for lying. \n\n>Amy and I have just never gotten along.

Yeah, I\u2019m going with OP and her family are in the wrong - none of that sounds like enough to justify excluding Amy from a significant family event and then lying about it, especially if it\u2019s a pattern."]}
