You have to understand that in most parts of South America stranger danger is the difference between getting robbed or stabbed.

I am quite sure he cursed me back in his language, but I still have this icky feeling in my head.I wonder if I am the asshole for not being more courteous, of is he was asking something that was even reasonable?

I don't believe it was uncalled for how uncomfortable I felt, but I also can see how I was very rude to him.
