Men are perfectly capable of raising children and doing chores to help around the house, and any who say otherwise are lazy and entitled.\n\nHe also seems to be trying to trick you into becoming a SAHM, keep on advancing your career and prepare for an inevitable divorce when he throws a tantrum over you expecting him to contribute to the household equally beyond merely the finances.", "Holy crap, he actually went there? Wow. You need to fix this before he starts bleeding that misogyny onto your daughter. NTA", "NTA congratulations on learning your husband is a misogynist. I would personally leave him.", "NTA \n\nYour husband is misogynistic as hell- sorry not sorry. \n\nThere is no excuse for you NOT to go on this work trip. Really put your foot down\n\nAlso make sure to tell both sets of parents that it\u2019s not their business how you run YOUR family. You are going in this work trip and that\u2019s final. \n\nHonestly, I know I always go this route- but if he doesn\u2019t back down and actually start acting like a parent and partner- you need to divorce. \n\nYou can be raising a grown man that runs to mommy and daddy every time he doesn\u2019t get his way or is expected to act like a damn parent\n\nEDIT: please think OP, do you really want to continue being married to someone who can\u2019t even care for the child you gave him ?", "NTA. Oh hell no. Tell him to pull his finger out and be a partner and a parent. Also, the next time he contacts all parents you\u2019ll be contacting a bloody lawyer because the double standards are astounding.\n\nNext text both his parents and yours, that your marriage is absolutely non of their business. If they want to continue to meddle in matters that are non of their business then you\u2019re happy to reduce contact with them.", "NTA - going on a required work trip, that your husband is aware of ahead of time, with child care already set up for a almost school aged child is not \u201cabandoning your family\u201d please take that phrase out of your vocabulary. This is a phrase your husband and his mother are using to shame your doing something they don\u2019t like. If you capitulate now, and stay home , it will only get worse. Next time it will be going out to lunch with friends, or visiting your family, or spending an afternoon shopping. \n\nYour husband is parent too, and he will be OK. If your mother in law is so worried, maybe she can come over and manage the household for him. \n\nThat being said- If possible, spend some time reassuring your husband and helping him plan for the week- he is likely just feeling insecure about your relationship and his ability to parent effectively alone.  I am definitely not saying that it\u2019s ok for him to act like this, but you have to deal with the reality as it is. He\u2019s been a little spoiled by your constant presence, and it will take some effort for him to adjust to this new reality where your every waking moment isn\u2019t devoted entirely to your family.", "Hire a maid, prepare frozen meals, even hire a nanny once in a while. So many solutions to keep both of you comfortable and happy", "NTA but you have to hold on to your job and savings even more now...who knows what other regressive ideas your husband will come up with? He probably had these ideas all along and didn't show it until you had a kid. Because it sounds a tad like there was pressure to have a child. And also why are all the parents involved. I'm so sorry. I hope you have supportive friends.", "NTA . . . What is with dudes in this world? I admit I have no kids, but I'd never dream of saying to my wife that she can't do anything because she needs to take care of the kid.\n\nMarriage is a partnership. The man signed up for it and was part of the kid process - don't get to step away now.\n\nUgh drives me bonkers to read some of these!", "NTA.  Sorry to say this, but hubby needs to grow up and realize this isn't the same generation your parents grew up in.  At 4 years old the kids are relatively easy.  Just make sure they're fed, bathed, and check in on them every now and then and they're usually pretty easy to care for.  A week alone with his kids won't kill him.  Trust me.  I'm a father of two and while both of mine can be a handful, I've spent longer than a week alone with them while their mother was in and out of the hospital.  (Long Story)  I won't say I'm Father of the Year material.  Not even close.  But the house is still in one piece and the kids are still healthy.  And he needs to learn this now.  What if, God Forbid, something happens to you?  How will he be able to cope without you around?", "Absolutely NTA. My husband and I split childcare and chores pretty equally. On weekends where I want to go out and do something, I'll try to arrange childcare so my husband can also have a break. But, he actually wants to keep our kids. He says there's no reason for anyone else to watch them, when he's home available and will also get lonely and miss them. He gets his breaks at different times and doesn't see the need to double up. \n\nParents should absolutely get breaks and adult time away from their children. But for the time when a parent is home and present/taking stress of their spouse, they should know how and want to take care of their children. Anything less than 50/50, unless specifically communicated and agreed on by both parties, is a selfish and misogynistic point of view that reverts us right back to the 50s.", "NTA\n\nAnd I agree with other posters . . . you need to continue on and make sure you are able to support yourself in case things get worse.\n\nYou have two sets of grandparents that think you should sacrifice for family.  Remind them that you are family and they are welcome to sacrifice a week of their time to take care of your adult husband and his child since he isn't capable.\n\nPlease make this your hill to die on.  There is no way these five people should be allowed to decide on how you should live your life.\n\nAnd if they bully you into giving up your job, which is where this sounds like it is heading, they will have taken away your options.  Don't allow it.", "NTA\n       \nI was giving your husband the benefit of the doubt, to try and see the reasoning behind his actions until I got to this part:\n        \n>I reminded him whenever he went on work trips, I managed it all by myself. He said its not the same since I am a women.\n            \nYour husband is misogynistic, and very lazy. I'm glad you stood up to defend your job and your responsibilities. There are many families in which both parents work and share the hours of caring for the house and the children.  It's pretty normal, and your husband needs to know it.", "NTA. You both have duties at home and at work. Being a woman doesn\u2019t magically imbue you with capability to do it all; he is just as capable and since you\u2019re both working, he needs to exercise that capability.", "Sorry you husband can't \"babysit\" his kid for that long. Ugh! If he thinks that you can actually do it all, what do you even need him for? Do you want him to be a role model to your kid? Do you want you succumbing to sexism be something your kid can learn? NTA but please consider your and your kid's future.", "Nta. Husband is controlling", "\u201cPlease explain to me why you having a penis makes any part of daily chores and childcare impossible. I\u2019ve seen it so many times, and have yet to see that it\u2019s so large as to interfere with standing next to a stove, packing a lunch, or reading bedtime stories. If there\u2019s something I\u2019ve missed besides your sexism, please let me know!!\u201d", "NTA. Tell your husband that you married him to be your partner. You are not his mother and it is not your job to take care of him or your house. As two grown adults the responsibilities towards house and family are to be split evenly. Keep your career and please remind your family that if YOU can work and care for a child, so can he. The presence of a vagina does not impart magical super powers. Enjoy your work trip.", " Fucking leave. Seriously. Why do you stay with this person? NTA. But your husband sees you as a bang maid. So do what you need to do.", "Block the parents on all media.  TAke the trip.  I don't know how to educate your ignorant husband.", "NTA omg how awful for you to discover that your husband and parents are such misogynists after all this time! Don't let them wear you down, in all honesty I'd find it really really difficult to feel the same way about my husband knowing he doesn't view me as his equal or that we're part of a team.", "Double standard hell no. He is a misogynist", "\"Please explain to me how your penis prevents you from doing the dishes\"", "He doesn\u2019t want an equal partner, he wants a sahm with no say or help from him.", "Hubby just outright admitted women are the superior sex \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "So NTA. Didn\u2019t realize lack of tits was a prerequisite for business trips\u2026", "Certainly OP is NTA, but I'd phrase it more, that if you back down you're accepting a role as a SAHM which is not the original agreement.  You can make that choice, but being pressured into making it is not fair.  And it double sucks to be the fulltime housewife, caregiver, and work.  Don't accept that no matter what.", "The fact that he got the parents involved says everything. She has two children.", "Before baby came we split chores evenly. After baby was born, I guess guilt overcame me since only he worked. I took over almost everything at home then, by own on. So I guess whatever he did felt big to me then, even the smallest stuff. \n\nWhen I went back to work I wanted it more even. He made comments but still held his side. This is first time he made it about gender.", "Just to be clear: both sets of parents also don't think there's nothing wrong with him leaving the family? Like... they don't think he's primary responsibility is to be present?", "Lack of tits would knock a lot of white collar execs out of the running in that case.", "NTA. The fact that he \"told on you\" to your mommies & daddies is so freaking childish. Go on the work trip. He CAN handle it, he just doesn't want to. He knows what to do.", "He absolutely is, but I think enough people had said it by the time I got here and poor OP\u2019s probably got the message :( I hope she goes on her work trip and has a whale of a time!", "So is his family and hers. They talked her into having a child she didn\u2019t want to but she did, she needs to keep moving in her career because I don\u2019t think this marriage will last and she\u2019s going to have to support herself and her child in the future.\n\nIf it works fine, but that\u2019s his child too. If the parents feel this way then they need to pitch in and help. He needs it either be a parent or hire a nanny if he wants nothing to do with his kid", "\ud83e\udd47 best comment ever!", "Oh my, hah! That deserved an award. I accidentally gave it anonymously though, sorry!", "Yeah, I agree. This really sucks for OP to be getting it in the neck not just from her misogynistic husband but from both sets of parents as well! Horrible!", "NTA. My 2 cents, hold on to your job. Your husband has just started escalating with his misogynistic behavior. Also, don\u2019t have anymore children with him if you want your peace of mind. I hope your marriage will survive this, because if this is how he thinks of you, it\u2019s going to affect every aspect of your relationship. He\u2019s not going to be happy if your career starts advancing, in his mind you\u2019re beneath him and all sacrifices should come from you.", "I wish you could edit the title of your post. I hate it. \n\nYou\u2019re going on a work trip, not some solo beach trip to an all inclusive resort (though I wouldn\u2019t blame you at all for that). \n\nYou are NOT abandoning your family!\n\nIs there a cultural and/or religious aspect to your parents\u2019 pressure (to have a child) and your parents\u2019 and husband\u2019s reaction to your required work trip? I\u2019m just trying to make sense of this and why all of your parents think they have the right to have an opinion. \n\nDO NOT quit your job (not that you\u2019re intending to)! And don\u2019t succumb to any pressure to have another child anytime soon. For me, something really seems \u201coff\u201d regarding your husband\u2019s complete change in attitude and views.", "He doesn\u2019t want an equal partner anymore.\nHe tasted the sahm vibe where the sahm does everything, and want\u2019s to go back to that.\nHold your job, go on the trip because you might need it when he really escalates this behavior and you need to be on your own.", "Ouchh", "NTA\n\nYour child/ren should learn what equal is and means.\n\nIndependence is the key when life happened.\n\nTomorrow you have to beg instead keeping your head high.\nRetirement can be awful if you don't have enough money.\nOr a divorce, illness or *god beware\" death.\n\nMostly as a woman."]}
