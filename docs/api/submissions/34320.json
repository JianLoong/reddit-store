Dealing with the physical side of miscarriage while caring for a baby is not easy. Your husband should be there for you. \n\nTell him you will message him every day to let him know you're ok but you don't need to be answering his calls to make him feel less guilty. Do whatever you need to do to get through the miscarriage and care for yourself and your 4mth old...asking any more of you is too much.", "NTA. This is a hill I would die on.

He enjoys this lifestyle too much to throw it away. You need to put your foot down and have a serious conversation about the future because things arent changing.", "NTA - use past behavior to inform future.

You say he\u2019s a caring husband and you have a good life together but is that the case or just the life he\u2019s promising that will never materialise? I find it far more controlling and manipulative on his part that he promised you a change in career to stop you ending the relationship and two years down the line this still hasn\u2019t happened. Not to mention the different stories cropping up surrounding this particular \u2018work event\u2019. First it\u2019s the money, then it\u2019s the networking.. he seems to have no intention of giving up this lifestyle so you need to ask yourself if this is the life you can live with long term.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss and for the fact that your husband is choosing not to be there for you. Personally, I think that whatever you need right now is what you should be doing, even if what you need is to not speak to your husband.

Sometimes it's just you prioritizing your own needs.", "ESH. \n\nFirst, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. You sincerely deserve to be treated better by your partner while you are going through this experience. I wish I could give you a hug. \n\nI\u2019m going to say this as gently as I can, as a Mom.\n\nAs an adult you knew that he was in an industry you didn\u2019t feel compatible with. You knew the consequences of continuing on with a relationship that isn\u2019t compatible. It doesn\u2019t end well for anyone when someone isn\u2019t willing to put their money where their mouth is. You hoped he would hold up his end of the bargain, but it doesn\u2019t seem that way. For months he keeps telling you and does nothing, so now you have to make a decision. \n\nHe is actively not leaving the lifestyle because he wants it. You know that is true or you wouldn\u2019t be mad. You are ALLOWED to be mad that he continues to let you down because he is CHOOSING this lifestyle over his family. \n\nSo you have s couple of choices because he isn\u2019t going to change, NO MATTER how much he promises. You can\u2019t change someone who doesn\u2019t want to be changed. \n\nYou can keep living this way and become bitter/angry/resentful OR you can make better choices for yourself and your child. I would lay it out for him and stop being an AH to yourself listening to the lies of a selfish man.", "NTA\n\nHe was never going to change his career, he only told you what you wanted to hear so he could manipulate you into doing what he wishes. He was never *not* going on that trip. It didn't matter what you said or what you did. And im willing to be he gets shit pay for... whatever it is he does. Is he some club promoter or something?\n\nIs this how you want to live the rest of your life? Being second (or third) behind his job?\n\nThere is a 0% chance I would stay with him.

I'm proud of you. \n\nNow stick to that. do not talk to him, your right, you do not need to worry about or sooth his guilt for leaving your right now. he's a shitty husband he can deal with his crap himself. you have enough to deal with and that is his fault. he could be home sharing this with you but he's not, cuz he's crappy and wanted to make it all about him even more. \n\nI want to talk about some hard things in my response to you. but I want to tell you I am saying all of this with love care and compassion in my soul....I am scared for you.  \n\nYour husband purposefully lied about wanting to quit his job, \n\nhe lied about it being last minute, you know its about networking, he has manipulated you, \n\nnow he has abandoned you, during an incredibly hard time. not only would it have been hard under normal circumstances, but your hormones were already messed up anyway from your infant. then messed up from getting pregnant and now a sharp decline with the miscarriage. not to mention the physical and mental toll that takes on your body. \n\nand your doing it all with an infant. with no help. \n\nI really want you to call your dr, the SECOND you think there even might be a hint of you not feeling mentally well. mental health is not to be messed with, and with the double dose of hellish hormones you are going through with the miscarriage too, low sleep, physical pain, emotional pain of your husbands abandonment and lies and betrayal....\n\nits a lot.\n\nYou need to take care of you. Yes of course your child, but if you are not number one mentally physically and emotionally to you right now, and you dont take care of your mental health and stuff, it will hurt your child... because your behavior and emotional connection with everyone and everything will decline without you noticing and that will effect your child accidentally.  \n\nso make sure you have support around you. friends, chosen family, therapist, support groups, mommy and me classes, someone, something to help you.  do not bury your feelings about any of this. your husband, your miscarriage, \n\nDO WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL SAFE AND LOVED AND SECURE AND WELL. AND DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DONT. \n\nI am truly so sorry you are experiencing this. I would not wish a miscarriage on my worst enemy.  it doesn't matter that you didn't have time to be emotionally invested. it still hurts. you still feel all the what did I do wrong,am I a failure, what the hell happened, why, why, why, im so sad my baby died, feelings ... and I'm sorry.   You shouldn't have to grieve your child alone. and too many of us women do just that.  I never could forgive my ex.  even with therapy. I highly suggest finding a therapist to see if you can, it's not easy to work through that particular feeling of betrayal by yourself. \n\ngood luck. and take care of you. and that little one...but really, dont forget you.", "I'm sorry for your loss and I hope you don't take what I say too harshly.  You are an adult in an adult relationship.  Please use your words rather than the silent treatment.

Also about the support you need going forward.\n\nYou say  he\u2019s a really caring husband.

He\u2019s partying, sorry I mean \u2018networking\u2019 and likes his life the way it is from the look of it. You, on the other hand, have convinced yourself that change is coming despite all the evidence to the contrary. Also, why try for another baby if you\u2019re unhappy with the current situation?! Isn\u2019t it better to revisit the convo about his job and reevaluate? \n\nYou should give him a deadline by which he needs to change his job. If he really means it (highly doubtful), he should be able to demonstrate at least an attempt to make a change, if not the change itself (e.g. unable to get another job, interview, etc).  Either way, you sound unhappy, he seems immature and it\u2019s impacting your marriage. Good luck. NTA", "First of all, I\u2019m sorry to hear about your miscarriage.

It's either N A H or E  S H on the South American festival. It's not fair of you to demand he give up the work unilaterally and it's also not fair that he just up and left without reaching an agreement.", "NTA.\n\nBut this doesn't seem to be about THIS instance.  This is a much bigger issue at play.  That issue is, you seem to want to enjoy the fruits of his labor, but not his labor.  And that is fine.  But at some point, as he is the sole provider, he probably has a better understanding of the financial implications of going vs. not going.   He also seems to say he wants to get out, but hasn't done it.  I''m going to go out on a limb and guess he makes a lot of money, and going to a different job would be a huge pay cut.  If that is the case, I get why, with having a small child at home, he is worried about cutting his pay.\n\nShould he have gone in this situation?  I don't know.   I don't know what the repercussions of that would be in his line of work, so its hard to say he was wrong.  But you are also entitled to your feelings.", "NTA - But you two really need counseling when he gets back. I don't think either of you were communicating your expectations well before.

Your husband is a year older than my husband. We had a miscarriage in October. He was glued to my side during the whole thing, drove me to the ER at 3 am because I was scared of how much I was bleeding, and took a week off work to stay at home with me after. You deserve better. I hope you have someone nearby who can help you out during this, and I'm sorry it's happening.\n\nETA I mention the age because you are younger and this is something he should have been better about.", "I think this is an ESH situation. Certainly I don\u2019t think he should\u2019ve left you during a miscarriage, despite the fact that he couldn\u2019t help you medically and you say that there was little emotional investment. I do wonder his accurately you related his reaction and what contracts or already-paid tickets might have been involved in his job. You could say he bait and switched you over his job, but I think it\u2019s foolish for people to accept essential incompatibilities and assume their partners will change. The silent treatment, to any degree, is an immature response.\n\nI know you say he\u2019s a good husband, but you two seem unable to discuss and make joint decisions on job/money issues, you clearly resent his job, he left you during a crisis, and he isn\u2019t respecting your boundaries while you refuse to talk to him. I think you two are completely incompatible. Counseling is certainly worth trying, but I don\u2019t see this relationship working out.", " NTA. He didn\u2019t need to go but made the choice.

You don't approve of his job but you're enjoying the life it provides.

Stop being a ball buster and grow up.", "yta you knew what his job was and if its his dream job you expect him to choose you over it. thats not fair there shouldnt be a choice but understanding. and in that industry networking is literally how people get their jobs/ upgrade. its a career industry not a job you leave at 5pm. sounds like hes stressed out with work, and he funds your life, LA is extremely expensive, you need to be more understanding on both sides.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He can\u2019t even give you that because he only cares about him, his feelings, and his wants. \n\nPrioritize yourself and your child. Don\u2019t let them grow up thinking that this is how you should accept being treated or should treat a partner.", ">neither of us had enough time to be emotionally invested in this pregnancy\n\nIs he emotionally invested in YOU??\n\nNTA", "NTA but if you're concerned about the silent treatment then send him a text saying \"I'm not in the right emotional space to talk on the phone right now so I won't be answering calls or non-emergency texts. If you need my input on something then it will have to wait.\" \n\nIf he says you need to call for an unspecified emergency then tell him if its important enough for a call, he will care enough to text you a summary.", " ...he insists he\u2019s going to be calling me all day \u201cso I don\u2019t have to worry\u201d...\n\nWhat the actual fuck....\nHe thinks you're worried about him?!?  He's the one who should be worried about his wife's condition!  \n\nNTA, but telling him you don't want to talk to him, then not talking to him, is not the silent treatment, IMO.  The silent treatment implies that you are not telling him why you are upset.  I think you were pretty clear about why.", "NTA..I am sorry that you have to go through this alone. How are you today? \n\nTo be honest, you saw the priority of your husband.\nHis family isn't his first priority and he won't change his career for you and your child. He just bought time with his talking about change.\n\nHe can live a lifestyle of a single guy during his work and come back to his little family. \n\nTime for thinking about couple therapy.", "NTA.  Turn the phone off.  \nHe's saying what you want to hear, but doing what he wants to do.  His lifestyle will not be changing so you need to stop fighting about it because the fighting won't fix or change anything.  If you can't live with this lifestyle, you may need to decide if this marriage can last.  He has also shown his work is a higher priority than you or your health, and that is another thing to think about.", ">he told me he was looking for a career change, he was tired of the lifestyle too and it would take just a couple of months as he was already getting paperwork to be able to work in another field\n\nSo... you know that was all a lie right?", "NTA. But silent treatment won\u2019t fix your situation. He has been stringing you along for years, and nothing is going to change. You need to face the fact that he likely lied to you early in your relationship about his plans to get you to stat around, and you need ask yourself if this is the life you want. Because he has proven to you that he is not willing to change, or to even put his family first. Because this is not about ability. This is a choice he is making. Also, he should not have any financial control over you. That is just a red flag smacking you in the face. You need to make him understand, that either things change NOW or you walk. And follow THROUGH with that. He has already bullshitted you into staying with him once. He likely has no doubt that he\u2019d be able to do it again. We aren\u2019t with our partners for their ability to \u201cget us\u201d in the good times alone, but equally for their ability to support us in the bad.", "NTA i am so so sorry this is happening", "Thank you, I forgot to add that then he admitted it wasn\u2019t because of the money but more about \u201cnetworking\u201d so it\u2019s not really about him needing to go, but more about him wanting to.", "The silent treatment isn\u2019t necessary manipulation. You\u2019re allowed to be mad.", "That\u2019s what I feel, he already had his plans and was thinking about telling me last minute so I couldn\u2019t say much about it, and then I have a miscarriage and he had to tell me right away, and honestly was more concerned about making everything ready because this was so \u201clast minute\u201d I was left alone bathing my baby, putting him to sleep while I was going trough excruciating pain and bleeding, because he needed to go out and meet with somebody related to the trip, by the time he came back he found me sleeping and then got up early in the morning to head to his trip, and wants to make me feel he cares by calling me, I just can\u2019t talk to him.", "Absolutely!", "I agree, NTA but it seems you two aren't compatible.", "I agree with everything said here.", "I cried reading this comment, thank you for the advice, I really relate to everything you just said.", "I understand, so far I haven\u2019t stopped communicating, I asked him to please stop calling me and looking for validation in what he\u2019s doing cause I\u2019m not going to give that to him and I just want to be left alone.\nBut where do I draw the line if he keeps insisting and calling and I just really don\u2019t want to talk.", "This is an empathetic, real answer\u2026but you are wrong. It sounds like she HAS been talking. She has been pleading. She has used her words.\n\nHe is one of two things: either astonishingly bad at changing careers (because it doesn\u2019t sound like bad luck), or he doesn\u2019t intend to. And we all know which is the right answer given his \u201cnetworking\u201d comment. He de facto lied to you when he said he would leave the industry and has been stringing you along. \n\nBut also, he had an opportunity to prioritize you above this career he doesn\u2019t want\u2026and he didn\u2019t. You were miscarrying and he went to work. Yes some industries are word of mouth and your reputation is important. He could have told them his wife was having a medical emergency, which justifies him backing out. \n\nMaybe you jumped to conclusions, but not mentioning it for two weeks is extremely sus when you are a new dad. How would you be able to plan help? Wouldn\u2019t he be worried if they actually hadn\u2019t confirmed? That is the third thing that sticks out. \n\nOP, you cannot make someone change into the person they say they want to be. You have to decide if you can be with someone in this lifestyle. It sounds like it is a dealbreaker for you (understandably). You are NTA for telling him you want space, and use it to think about what you want. Like a separation.", "It is resonable when its a career he has said he doesnt want, asking him to drop the trip is just his gf being a good partner nd helping him get away from a career he said he didnt want. The only ahole is the guy who lied about what he wanted then was shocked when his gf was a good person and followed what he said :/ honestly she needs to leave, this guy is a pathetic liar and can party himself to the grave for all i care but i cannot sit here nd pretend im not furious that such a disgusting creature calling itself a man would dare lie to someone for so long. Get em preganant twice then abandone them the minute the second kid is losing its life.... nah that disgusting he is 100% the ahole she is just a poor girl stuck in a situation she cant seem to grasp is abusive but its ok i was there too once nd now me nd my daughter are free nd if she wises up her nd her 4month old will hopefully be free of tht creature too someday", "She doesnt want the fruit u spoon she even tried to use her own fruit (her savings) to get him out of the career he supposedly hates. She wants the man he said he was simple as and honestly he lied, he isnt tht man nd she needs to wake up nd leave cause the man she is chasing doesnt exist", "You\u2019re a lucky woman. And this should be a normal behavior. \nIt\u2019s crazy to even discuss about this. The bar for empathy is so low.", "On her savings that he won't let them use because it really isn't about money, is it? It's about his freedom and the fact that his family isn't a priority for him.", "What?! He lied to her about leaving that business when they met, purposely and evidently blidsided her for two years saying \u201che waits for paperwork\u201d and left her during the most stressful and heartbreaking period of her life with their 4 month-old. \nShe\u2019s not in the slightest at wrong here. \nStop with victim blaming!", "I didn\u2019t expect him to do nothing, I told him we were incompatible and would do better as friends, his situation is far from a \u201cdream job\u201d and he begged me and convinced me he was looking for a way out.\nI was naive, and let him dragged me into this but I never expect him to change for me, I even told him there was nothing wrong on him choosing to live like this, but it\u2019s not what I wanted for me. He didn\u2019t had the integrity to tell me the truth and let me go", "Tell him you will network yourself right over to family who will care for you and your child. Why is he networking if he's \"trying to change careers?\" It's been a couple years and he hasn't done that yet, he isn't going to. He has shown that you are not his priority. Time for you to make yourself a priority and give him an ultimatum (I hate ultimatums) but given the circumstances he needs to change jobs and make his family a priority or he can keep his job and say goodbye to family. Even though you haven't felt a \"bond\" yet with the missed baby, it can hit later. \n\nNTA. And I hope you give an update", "I\u2019m sorry for the loss you are going through. \n\nYou are allowing yourself to be mistreated though by just going forward in the relationship without holding him accountable to what he says. He has no intention to change jobs, clearly. If he was \u201ctired of the lifestyle\u201d he\u2019d prioritize the paperwork to get out of said lifestyle. He likes it so he doesn\u2019t. \n\nYou \u201creally get each other\u201d and \u201clive a good life together\u201d when you\u2019re ignoring your issues and his lies so he can keep stringing you along.", "So, his networking will come before his family. Do with that information what you will.\n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this. Do what you need to do to take care of yourself for the moment. I wouldn't call this the silent treatment, for starters. It sounds like you kinda don't have the capacity to handle talking to him right now while dealing with the miscarriage. You can't not deal with your physical health, but you don't have to deal with tge traveling now at all.\n\nI would honestly just communicate that \"I can't talk to you right now. I'll contact you when I'm ready to\". Honestly, I had written a more polit version of this but then realized there's seriously no need to say \"I'm sorry\" at any point. Just something to get him to back off so you can have a minute to breathe here", "Why does he need to network if he's going to be leaving this industry soon? It seems like he's just been saying what you want to hear without the slightest intention of following through and meanwhile has you trapped with a baby and no source of income yourself so that you're dependent on him.", "Don't ignore the importance of networking. Network is crucial to moving a career forward. Regardless, he could have skipped this one time.", "I am so sorry you\u2019ve had to endure this, and without the support from the one person who is supposed to be by your side through these things. You and your baby deserve someone who wants to be there day and night.", "Hugs. Even early miscarriages are painful and the hormone rush is absolutely no joke. Take time to care for yourself and consider a long, hard conversation with him when he gets home to evaluate your values and relationship.  You can even say, \u201cI\u2019m struggling right now and communication is very difficult. I want to discuss this but please let\u2019s wait until you return home and I am in a better place.\u201d", "your welcome....listen, I really struggled going through something entirely too similar and I have a lot of experience with miscarriages. I have had 10....let's just say I grieved alone with them all.... so if you want to talk. I'm here. just message me. but you're not alone. never alone.", "I would include that in your OP as it changes things a bit.  If you have already told him you want to be left alone and he continues to call and call, I think you are within your right to not answer.  You've already made yourself clear and he is disregarding that for (as you said) validation.", "You are not giving the silent treatment. NTA.\n\nYou have enough to cope with right now. A young child, a miscarriage and all of the emotions that come with that and a partner who made the decision to leave you high and drive.\n\nWe all have choices in life - know that this is your husband telling and showing you that he will ALWAYS choose work (and optional work travel at that) over you, your needs and even your health.\n\nHe has shown you who he is and what his priorities are. Now it is up to you to decide what you are going to do with that information.\n\nI'll tell you now - it is not going to get better until he has a MASSIVE wakeup call... and even then it likely will not get better for years.", "If he continues to bombard you when you explicitly asked him to stop, it\u2019s not the silent treatment, it\u2019s holding a reasonable boundary.", "Keep answering his calls, but keep it short. He owes you big on this one and he knows it.", "Absolutely this. This does not seem to be a man who wants to change or feels a need to change despite having a wife and new baby.  Take this time and reflect on all of your communication and his decisions, OP. You are NTA.", "he has to support her and a child in one of the highest cost of living cities in the world. hes worked in the entertainment industry all his career and prob isnt qualified for anything else. what do you expect someone who has the entire financial weight on their shoulders to do? and from her description hes clearly stressed. as i said they need to meet half way in understanding. someone who is the sole financial provider cant afford to drop everything, literally for the sake of the both of them. on top of that she says theyre incompatible and wants to be friends yet takes no precaution in personal health. insanity", "I know Reddit like to throw this around a lot but please divorce or at least separate and demand couples therapy. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re not a priority to this man. What if you had died from the miscarriage would he just go about his life because he has work? He should of been by your side every step of the way", "if you think that why arent you using some form of birth control?  sorry but no one can drag you into anything, you are making choices. if you feel incompatible then leave, you are very young, get a job or find another man to pay for you. no offense but you seem to have a strong opinion here. you dont need strangers validation. you have your answer", "Except\u2026 he allegedly wanted to change careers.  Which I sense was a lie on the husband\u2019s part.", "The whole point is that he says he doesn\u2019t want this career and therefore doesn\u2019t need to move it forward.", "She stated clearly he will not earn that much this month and she can cover them both this month and then he said he isn\u2019t going because of money but because of networking. \nHe\u2019s a liar, blindsided her and LEFT HER BLEEDING FROM MISCARRIAGE WHILE TAKING CARE ALONE OF HIS 4 MONTH OLD. \nNow reread all of this above again. \nAnd if you recognize yourself in his actions, don\u2019t date at all. FAFO.", "That\u2019s what I told him, why is it so important to network to you on an environment you\u2019re supposedly looking for a way out.", "You were bamboozled my dear. I'm sorry he is such a cad. I would be concerned about what else he has not been honest about. Unfortunately this is your life now. He will not change and doesn't seem like he wants to. You are at a crossroads and need to decide if you want to continue in the relationship or part ways.", "I think you really need to sit down and talk to him about what you guys want because it doesnt seem like your husband has any plans to leave his career. He already hasnt been honest with you, he wants to have a family and have you as his wife while also partying and living it up in his career, and so far he's been able to have both at your expense. You may have to decide on your own if you want to stay in this relationship or not, like if this is going to be your life and he's not going to change careers do you want to stay with him?"]}
