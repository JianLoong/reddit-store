Dealing with the physical side of miscarriage while caring for a baby is not easy. Your husband should be there for you. \n\nTell him you will message him every day to let him know you're ok but you don't need to be answering his calls to make him feel less guilty. Do whatever you need to do to get through the miscarriage and care for yourself and your 4mth old...asking any more of you is too much.", "NTA. This is a hill I would die on.

He enjoys this lifestyle too much to throw it away. You need to put your foot down and have a serious conversation about the future because things arent changing.", "NTA - use past behavior to inform future.

You say he\u2019s a caring husband and you have a good life together but is that the case or just the life he\u2019s promising that will never materialise? I find it far more controlling and manipulative on his part that he promised you a change in career to stop you ending the relationship and two years down the line this still hasn\u2019t happened. Not to mention the different stories cropping up surrounding this particular \u2018work event\u2019. First it\u2019s the money, then it\u2019s the networking.. he seems to have no intention of giving up this lifestyle so you need to ask yourself if this is the life you can live with long term.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss and for the fact that your husband is choosing not to be there for you. Personally, I think that whatever you need right now is what you should be doing, even if what you need is to not speak to your husband.

Sometimes it's just you prioritizing your own needs.", "ESH. \n\nFirst, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. You sincerely deserve to be treated better by your partner while you are going through this experience. I wish I could give you a hug. \n\nI\u2019m going to say this as gently as I can, as a Mom.\n\nAs an adult you knew that he was in an industry you didn\u2019t feel compatible with. You knew the consequences of continuing on with a relationship that isn\u2019t compatible. It doesn\u2019t end well for anyone when someone isn\u2019t willing to put their money where their mouth is. You hoped he would hold up his end of the bargain, but it doesn\u2019t seem that way. For months he keeps telling you and does nothing, so now you have to make a decision. \n\nHe is actively not leaving the lifestyle because he wants it. You know that is true or you wouldn\u2019t be mad. You are ALLOWED to be mad that he continues to let you down because he is CHOOSING this lifestyle over his family. \n\nSo you have s couple of choices because he isn\u2019t going to change, NO MATTER how much he promises. You can\u2019t change someone who doesn\u2019t want to be changed. \n\nYou can keep living this way and become bitter/angry/resentful OR you can make better choices for yourself and your child. I would lay it out for him and stop being an AH to yourself listening to the lies of a selfish man.", "NTA\n\nHe was never going to change his career, he only told you what you wanted to hear so he could manipulate you into doing what he wishes. He was never *not* going on that trip. It didn't matter what you said or what you did. And im willing to be he gets shit pay for... whatever it is he does. Is he some club promoter or something?\n\nIs this how you want to live the rest of your life? Being second (or third) behind his job?\n\nThere is a 0% chance I would stay with him.

I'm proud of you. \n\nNow stick to that. do not talk to him, your right, you do not need to worry about or sooth his guilt for leaving your right now. he's a shitty husband he can deal with his crap himself. you have enough to deal with and that is his fault. he could be home sharing this with you but he's not, cuz he's crappy and wanted to make it all about him even more. \n\nI want to talk about some hard things in my response to you. but I want to tell you I am saying all of this with love care and compassion in my soul....I am scared for you.  \n\nYour husband purposefully lied about wanting to quit his job, \n\nhe lied about it being last minute, you know its about networking, he has manipulated you, \n\nnow he has abandoned you, during an incredibly hard time. not only would it have been hard under normal circumstances, but your hormones were already messed up anyway from your infant. then messed up from getting pregnant and now a sharp decline with the miscarriage. not to mention the physical and mental toll that takes on your body. \n\nand your doing it all with an infant. with no help. \n\nI really want you to call your dr, the SECOND you think there even might be a hint of you not feeling mentally well. mental health is not to be messed with, and with the double dose of hellish hormones you are going through with the miscarriage too, low sleep, physical pain, emotional pain of your husbands abandonment and lies and betrayal....\n\nits a lot.\n\nYou need to take care of you. Yes of course your child, but if you are not number one mentally physically and emotionally to you right now, and you dont take care of your mental health and stuff, it will hurt your child... because your behavior and emotional connection with everyone and everything will decline without you noticing and that will effect your child accidentally.  \n\nso make sure you have support around you. friends, chosen family, therapist, support groups, mommy and me classes, someone, something to help you.  do not bury your feelings about any of this. your husband, your miscarriage, \n\nDO WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL SAFE AND LOVED AND SECURE AND WELL. AND DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DONT. \n\nI am truly so sorry you are experiencing this. I would not wish a miscarriage on my worst enemy.  it doesn't matter that you didn't have time to be emotionally invested. it still hurts. you still feel all the what did I do wrong,am I a failure, what the hell happened, why, why, why, im so sad my baby died, feelings ... and I'm sorry.   You shouldn't have to grieve your child alone. and too many of us women do just that.  I never could forgive my ex.  even with therapy. I highly suggest finding a therapist to see if you can, it's not easy to work through that particular feeling of betrayal by yourself. \n\ngood luck. and take care of you. and that little one...but really, dont forget you.", "I'm sorry for your loss and I hope you don't take what I say too harshly.  You are an adult in an adult relationship.  Please use your words rather than the silent treatment.

Also about the support you need going forward.\n\nYou say  he\u2019s a really caring husband.

He\u2019s partying, sorry I mean \u2018networking\u2019 and likes his life the way it is from the look of it. You, on the other hand, have convinced yourself that change is coming despite all the evidence to the contrary. Also, why try for another baby if you\u2019re unhappy with the current situation?! Isn\u2019t it better to revisit the convo about his job and reevaluate? \n\nYou should give him a deadline by which he needs to change his job. If he really means it (highly doubtful), he should be able to demonstrate at least an attempt to make a change, if not the change itself (e.g. unable to get another job, interview, etc).  Either way, you sound unhappy, he seems immature and it\u2019s impacting your marriage. Good luck. NTA", "First of all, I\u2019m sorry to hear about your miscarriage.

It's either N A H or E  S H on the South American festival. It's not fair of you to demand he give up the work unilaterally and it's also not fair that he just up and left without reaching an agreement.", "NTA.\n\nBut this doesn't seem to be about THIS instance.  This is a much bigger issue at play.  That issue is, you seem to want to enjoy the fruits of his labor, but not his labor.  And that is fine.  But at some point, as he is the sole provider, he probably has a better understanding of the financial implications of going vs. not going.   He also seems to say he wants to get out, but hasn't done it.  I''m going to go out on a limb and guess he makes a lot of money, and going to a different job would be a huge pay cut.  If that is the case, I get why, with having a small child at home, he is worried about cutting his pay.\n\nShould he have gone in this situation?  I don't know.   I don't know what the repercussions of that would be in his line of work, so its hard to say he was wrong.  But you are also entitled to your feelings.", "NTA - But you two really need counseling when he gets back. I don't think either of you were communicating your expectations well before.

Your husband is a year older than my husband. We had a miscarriage in October. He was glued to my side during the whole thing, drove me to the ER at 3 am because I was scared of how much I was bleeding, and took a week off work to stay at home with me after. You deserve better. I hope you have someone nearby who can help you out during this, and I'm sorry it's happening.\n\nETA I mention the age because you are younger and this is something he should have been better about.", "I think this is an ESH situation. Certainly I don\u2019t think he should\u2019ve left you during a miscarriage, despite the fact that he couldn\u2019t help you medically and you say that there was little emotional investment. I do wonder his accurately you related his reaction and what contracts or already-paid tickets might have been involved in his job. You could say he bait and switched you over his job, but I think it\u2019s foolish for people to accept essential incompatibilities and assume their partners will change. The silent treatment, to any degree, is an immature response.\n\nI know you say he\u2019s a good husband, but you two seem unable to discuss and make joint decisions on job/money issues, you clearly resent his job, he left you during a crisis, and he isn\u2019t respecting your boundaries while you refuse to talk to him. I think you two are completely incompatible. Counseling is certainly worth trying, but I don\u2019t see this relationship working out.", " NTA. He didn\u2019t need to go but made the choice.

You don't approve of his job but you're enjoying the life it provides.

Stop being a ball buster and grow up.", "yta you knew what his job was and if its his dream job you expect him to choose you over it. thats not fair there shouldnt be a choice but understanding. and in that industry networking is literally how people get their jobs/ upgrade. its a career industry not a job you leave at 5pm. sounds like hes stressed out with work, and he funds your life, LA is extremely expensive, you need to be more understanding on both sides.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She knew how he was before getting hitched, and for a year after that when she fell pregnant. She just can\u2019t get a free pass\n\nAlso the whole half the property thing only really applies if she\u2019s from a country that has such rules", "NTA. If it were me, his stuff would be moved out of the house, a text sent with the location of his things along with an attorney\u2019s contact information, and then blocked. No person of worth would do this, OP; he\u2019s shown you who he is, believe him. I\u2019m so very sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "You said y\u2019all weren\u2019t compatible, he didn\u2019t change shit, so you \u2026 had his kid and are trying for another?\n\nWhy are you getting knocked up again right after you gave birth? That\u2019s super dangerous.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re expecting with all these questionable choices you\u2019re making.", "Oh honey he won't ever leave this field.  Sorry but it's been 2yrs he just wanted you to be ok with it or just put up with it.  I'm sorry you haven't split up yet, but you could always try tomorrow.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss :( .", "NTA but from what you're saying, it doesn't sound like he's supporting you or following through on his word and committments he's made to the relationship, like changing his career, being present for you etc.  This feels like a bigger issue that needs to be addressed - whether this relationship is really best for you.  \n\n\nI am so, so sorry for your loss and the emotions with it.  I hope you can find some support close to home while he's gone.", "NTA. Why do we feel we HAVE TO answer the phone, so people can't say we are being manipulating? You have a right to do what is best for you and if that is NOT to console your husband by talking to him (because he feels guilty). Then do that. It seems his actions are putting you into a darker place and you need to be able to console yourself.\n\nMy sister was in love with someone who kept stringing her along for YEARS. She went to a therapist and she says the best thing she did was give the relationship a timeline, then she got on with her life. You can chose to inform him if you want to do this and it is not an ultimatum, it is a fact. Then you make plans of what your next steps will be, so you are prepared to follow through.\n\nI was also with someone who wanted to get married but I held back, as we had some fundamental value issues. It was so hard but I had to let them go because it was something that I just couldn't live with, even though I tried.\n\nSo, if this lifestyle is just not for you, then that is okay. You need to be happy and bring your child up in a happy home.\n\nFor now just take the time to allow yourself to heal - physically and emotionally, and enjoy your baby.", "NTA he is a MASSIVE AH\n\nFirstly, I am so sorry for your loss. You need everyone you can to be near you. That is incredibly painful emotionally.\n\nSecondly. You have voiced your opinion for YEARS. He ignores it and has been lying about wanting a career change and about doing the paperwork as a procrastination tactic. HE ISN\u2019T GOING TO CHANGE!\n\nRun. He values his crappy partying-career-traveling lifestyle more than his wife and family, so he can have it. Good riddance! Im so sorry this is the time he decides to run off to another country. \n\nA good husband wouldve dropped everything and figured it out", "NTA I had a miscarriage about 9 years ago. My wife (we are both women) got shit faced drunk while I laid there bleeding, cramping and crying. We worked through it but I still don't know if I've completely forgiven her. When I think about it, I still feel some anger and a tremendous amount of sadness. Your husband does not at all comprehend how far reaching the consequences of his choice will be. I don't blame you at all for not wanting to talk to him right now.", "You deserve better. It's not about his job it's about his lack of empathy as a HUMAN being, let alone a husband.", "No good man would leave his wife during a medical crisis like this.\n\nForget about whether or not you should be giving him the silent treatment, you should be deciding whether or not you want to continue to build a family and marriage with this asshole.", "I\u2019m in the music industry, and so is my husband. It is a lot of late nights and a lot of travel, but not like what you\u2019re talking about. Late nights are generally 2 or 3 am. Tours and festivals are planned well in advance and usually budgeted down to the penny. No one is just tagging along at the last minute \u2014 every person is another mouth to feed and another bunk to find. I find that this is true regardless of how big or small the band. \n\nSome people may drink, and some do not, but the heavy party scenes are generally a thing of the past for most serious musicians and other music industry professionals. \n\nThere used to be a huge \u201cno days off\u201d mentality, but COVID changed that. People are more aware and understanding of others\u2019 health needs.  People would have understood if he told them he had to stay home with you because of your miscarriage. \n\nWhat you\u2019re describing with his schedule and the spontaneity is not how the music industry works. It\u2019s something else.", "NTA: \n\nhe made you a sahm so you can become dependent on him. \n\nhe doesn\u2019t care or consider your feelings especially after leaving you home alone to bleed out for days. \n\nfind a job and leave while you can, take the baby and file for whatever custody or child payment plan is best for you. \n\nIm so sorry and I hope things work out for you soon\ud83d\udc95", "Just because you didn't have time to be emotionally invested does mean it does not hurt you physically and mentally.", "Yta  he has to make money with you being a SAHM and allow you to live comfortably to do this \u2026 you\u2019re being selfish and u initially didn\u2019t want him to go but it seems u would be using the miscarriage as a form of manipulation even u said u weren\u2019t emotionally invested in the pregnancy yet", "YTA to yourself. You got played. How long are you going to remain played? He strung you along on the work change until he locked you in. Is still off to party despite you needing him. Doesn't sound like he gets you as much as you get him.", "definitely NTA. I'm really sorry that happened to you and I hope you are doing better now and can get through it", "and why did you choose to procreate with a man like this?", "NTA - he has been gaslighting you since you noted the incompatibility. He continues to show you who he is; believe him. The change you are hoping for is not on the horizon. What paperwork takes two years to complete? Have you seen any proof of progress of said paperwork? He admitted to lying on several occasions. Did they really not tell him until they were there; or did he know well in advance and was gaslighting you? How many other red flags do you need? Do you need a call from the emergency room as a result of him partying to hard? Do you need to evidence of his partying to land on your shared doorstep?\n\nHe expects the comfortable living arrangements/lifestyle to keep you from leaving. Especially, since you are a SAHM. That has a tendency to become financial manipulation.", "NTA\n\nBut you seriously need to re-think this relationship because he's never going to put your first. He's always going to put his job before you as clearly shown by leaving you alone whilst you were having a miscarriage\n\nHonestly I'd serve him divorce papers when he gets home.", "It\u2019s a horrible event but the last thing he would probably want to do is jeopardize his career. A lot of employers/clients won\u2019t take kindly to canceling for an event or the like. I\u2019m sure he isn\u2019t jumping at the bit to abandon her, but sometimes you need to just grit your teeth and do the hard thing.", "Yeah this was my thought too. Like OP said they weren\u2019t compatible, married him anyway, had a kid with him, then prevented getting pregnant again REAL fast. Like OP what are you even doing? He sucks for leaving, but OP sucks for staying. ESH. Except the 4 month old. They\u2019re probably just doing baby things.", "While networking may sometimes be code for partying that isn\u2019t always the case. It\u2019s an extremely important aspect of some industries and the only way to make sure you continue to get work when other opportunities dry up.", "That\u2019s the thing, I wouldn\u2019t even call it a \u201ccareer\u201d I just don\u2019t want to be too specific but what he does is not some sort of professional job, he\u2019s not a musician, and he indeed drinks and consumes heavy drugs at this parties every weekend.\nSo at this point \u201cI\u2019ve to work\u201d is the excuse for this shitty behavior of his.", "Yeah. I agree. I have family who do the silent treatment and it screws with your head. \n\nOP is definitely at end of rope", "Why does he need to network in a career he says he's going to leave?\n\nBecause he's not going to change careers.  I'm sorry, OP.", "Oh friend, I am so sorry. You are allowed to need the space you need from him. That is incredibly selfish. Also, he is lying to you about wanting to leave the profession. People do what they really want to do. If he wanted to get out, he would not be going to \"network.\"", "Honestly I wouldn\u2019t be answering his calls either. Put yourself first in this. Do what you need to do to feel ok. I doubt his calls will accomplish that.", "You create an auto text response to home calling that says \u201cI want to be left alone. Stop calling me.\u201d \n\nIf you\u2019ve told him, you\u2019ve told him. That isn\u2019t the silent treatment, it\u2019s needing space.\n\nWhen you are ready to talk to him, feel free to tell him \u201cthank you for the space. I am ready to talk when you are\u201d or \u201cwe will talk about this when you are home\u201d", "It\u2019s not that complicated. You\u2019re making it complicated because you want to. Go back to work. Put your child in day care. You need to stay relevant in your industry because your marriage is not going to last. He will cheat if he hasn\u2019t already. You need to make your own money so you will be able to support yourself after the inevitable divorce.", "And yet she chose to have a baby with him.  \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "Exactly, he wants her to reassure him everything is OK when it's clearly not. OP you already told him your feelings.  You need time to process without dealing with his constant need for appeasement, it's not abuse. It's self care.", "Okay but you should at least give SOME sort of time-frame instead of just abruptly refusing to talk to them.", "Have you ever jumped ship like this, to start an entirely new career in an entirely new profession? I have.\n\nYou are convinced he's lying, based on a sketched our narrative by a frustrated individual writing in what she concedes is marginal English. But sure, go ahead and tell us what's really going on and what he really means.\n\nI can fully believe he's a putz not making a move. It's a likely rationale given the info we have. I can also see how what he's doing is more difficult and more complicated than OP is giving him credit for.\n\nYou've just decided he's \"obviously\" a lying miscreant and want to see him burn in Hell. Good for you.\n\nGood night.", "Mainly I was responding to the general point that taking time is fine.\n\nAs for how my point pertains to the OP, sort of.  \u201cLeave me alone while you\u2019re on this trip\u201d isn\u2019t quite the same as something like \u201clet\u2019s put a pin in this until you get back.\u201d  This information was also an edit."]}
