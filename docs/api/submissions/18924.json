Last night I got a call from my sister (21F who lives with us) that my brother (23M) was in an emergency situation. We talked for about 30 min as she explained what happened. Some of it did involve cops coming to my home. \n\nTonight, my brother called me asking my advice. The situation is very serious and may involve legal implications even though he is innocent. He and I talked for a half hour, and my husband decided to try to go to sleep. I admit I should have left the room for the call, but I guess I thought he was somewhat invested and might want to hear what was going on. He did chime in a few times to also offer advice to my brother. I offered what I could being so far away and we made a plan for when I get back. \n\nAfter that call, I immediately called my grandma who is in the same town as my brother to see if she could reach out and help him while I am out of town. I spent 13 minutes giving her the run down.\n\nWhen I got off the phone with my grandma, my husband was upset. He felt like I should have just had a brief conversation and reminded them I\u2019m on my honeymoon and to not disturb us. He was also mad that I spent so much time on the phone while he was trying to go to sleep. \n\nI would normally agree with him if it was some sort of minor family drama. However, we don\u2019t normally have any sort of drama, and this is an extreme situation. We are very close, and I didn\u2019t feel it was right to leave my younger siblings trying to figure it out themselves. \n\nHe and I will discuss it in the morning if it\u2019s still bothering him, but I just have to know, AITA for spending time on the phone with my family during our honeymoon?\n\nETA: My phone call with my brother was to get a plan for when I get back, and my phone call to my grandma was to get him some emotional support while I\u2019m gone. Both phone calls with the purpose of quickly (but compassionately) handling the situation to the best of my current ability so I could bring my focus back to my husband for the remainder of our trip. Realizing now that the purpose of these calls may not have been clear to my husband so I will discuss with him when he\u2019s up in the AM.", "created_utc": 1685854667, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1401npz/aita_for_having_semilong_phone_calls_with_my/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would think it's fair to let them know to keep you updated via text, but a gentle reminder that you are on your honeymoon and once you're back you will be able to give the situation more time and attention\n\nI see this as maybe your husband is concerned about it evolving into a bigger thing that will take you away from enjoying your honeymoon together, and I would have the same concerns.

Your advice isn't helping him legally. If he needs to talk to someone, have him talk to someone's back home. How are you solving anything you have no control over and needs to be handled by a lawyer?", "YTA - I get it's an emergency situation, but I don't get why your sister had to call you on your freaking honeymoon - and frankly, this type of family drama is a bit of a bad omen for your marriage. It feels like these family members have no respect for boundaries, there is no great excuse to tangle you up on this stuff unless it was some medical life-or-death type emergency. This is supposed to be time between you and your husband, to start off your marriage as a couple - not as an extended family. This isn't just about phone calls, it's about boundary violations.\n\nDo you have lots of family drama going on for a long time? Just curious, because this is all a bit off to me. You say that you don't, but maybe you should ask your husband if he thinks your family has a lot of drama - listen to whatever he says, and don't argue. LISTEN. He's the only one who has an outside perspective, and you might not know what is going on here because you're so close to it IMHO.", "YTA why didn\u2019t you just take your brother and grandma on the honeymoon since you miss them so much?", "ESH, girl put your electronics/phone down and enjoy your honeymoon.

I\u2019m sorry, but nothing trumps a family emergency and I\u2019m concerned your husband isn\u2019t on the same page as you on that. \n\nAlso, you guys were both clearly in this phone conversation.

Get off your phone, the internet and any other electronic device and enjoy your time with your husband!", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\nWhile I think you should have left the room for the call, this wasnt casual conversation. This was about an emergency your family had.", "NTA but leaning heavily towards NAH\n\nI don't think you're an asshole forhaving these calls (although I do think it's rude to do it in the same room as someone who was trying to sleep) but I can see where the husband is coming from. Two days of interruption and he is probably thinking it's going to be like this the whole trip.\n\nI have no idea how big an emergency this was, so it's very hard to say whether it's something that you could hand back to the rest of the family to take care of whilst you're on your honeymoon or if you need to be involved or not, but you clearly need to have a conversation with husband about expectations for the rest of your trip. If you do need to talk to them more, then I wouldn't do it in the same room when he's trying to go to bed.\n\nCongrats on the marriage and I hope your family is OK.", "Husband is TA here, and I'm sorry that you're finding out he lacks a bit of empathy so early into your marriage. From the title and the whingey reaction, I thought I'd read that you were spending hours and hours on the phone for no good reason.  \n\nOf course you would both prefer to not be dealing with family drama on your honeymoon. But it's an emergency and from how you describe it, you've been pretty measured in how much time you've devoted to it. As for leaving the room for the calls, does Husband not care at all about an emergency situation his family (albeit in-laws) is in?", "NTA\n\nThis is your family. Being on honeymoon doesn't mean you don't care. It's not like you made the calls during a romantic dinner date. It was in the evening and cut into some sleep time, which can be made up for. Your husband should understand that you would rather be involved and help them with an EMERGENCY matter than go home and find that you missed everything.", "I\u2019d want to know what was going on.
