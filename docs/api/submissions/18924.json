Last night I got a call from my sister (21F who lives with us) that my brother (23M) was in an emergency situation. We talked for about 30 min as she explained what happened. Some of it did involve cops coming to my home. \n\nTonight, my brother called me asking my advice. The situation is very serious and may involve legal implications even though he is innocent. He and I talked for a half hour, and my husband decided to try to go to sleep. I admit I should have left the room for the call, but I guess I thought he was somewhat invested and might want to hear what was going on. He did chime in a few times to also offer advice to my brother. I offered what I could being so far away and we made a plan for when I get back. \n\nAfter that call, I immediately called my grandma who is in the same town as my brother to see if she could reach out and help him while I am out of town. I spent 13 minutes giving her the run down.\n\nWhen I got off the phone with my grandma, my husband was upset. He felt like I should have just had a brief conversation and reminded them I\u2019m on my honeymoon and to not disturb us. He was also mad that I spent so much time on the phone while he was trying to go to sleep. \n\nI would normally agree with him if it was some sort of minor family drama. However, we don\u2019t normally have any sort of drama, and this is an extreme situation. We are very close, and I didn\u2019t feel it was right to leave my younger siblings trying to figure it out themselves. \n\nHe and I will discuss it in the morning if it\u2019s still bothering him, but I just have to know, AITA for spending time on the phone with my family during our honeymoon?\n\nETA: My phone call with my brother was to get a plan for when I get back, and my phone call to my grandma was to get him some emotional support while I\u2019m gone. Both phone calls with the purpose of quickly (but compassionately) handling the situation to the best of my current ability so I could bring my focus back to my husband for the remainder of our trip.

Since you feel that way, you shouldn\u2019t answer anyone\u2019s calls while you\u2019re on your honeymoon or any vacation for that matter. OP could have done the same thing but she didn\u2019t. She clearly wanted to know what was going on. Her brother and sister weren\u2019t wrong to tell her what was happening. As I said many people would be upset if something like this happened while they were away and they weren\u2019t immediately informed.", "My thought is many Americans spend a lot of money, maybe even go into debt for the honeymoon/wedding. The idea being you'll only have 1 honeymoon. Things are often nonrefundable and people are generally hard to reach possibly overseas or somewhere with limited cell service. Even if they're not they act like they are because many Americans overwork, don't get enough PTO, and it's a rare break of a block of time that people expect them to devote to each other. This means people usually go out of their way to avoid contacting them barring emergencies. They don't have to feel selfish about it either. Since this was an emergency I think the initial call was unavoidable, but super unfortunate. The 2nd call only made her more worried and there's a limit to what she can do from afar. Maybe putting Grandma on 3 way with the brother during the 2nd call would have worked out better.", "I'm not trying to be argumentative but I don't understand why you're parenting your adult brother. I do understand a quick phone call, under 5 minutes.  Why are you planning anything for a grown man? If he's in legal trouble he needs a lawyer not his sister.", "My thoughts as well. Vacations in general are supposed to come with a break from family (who isn't there) and honeymoons especially so. Understandable to talk through a family emergency but there is a limit to how much time you should spend (and what you can do) at that point. And from what I'm reading Husband was understanding to that point but got annoyed when OP was calling people who other family could have clearly looped in. Also worth pointing out that this occured sometime during evening/night where there is an expectation of intimacy.", "I just want to point out the sister is 21 while OP is 29 and this is a legal situation. She may have felt more comfortable and better understood what needed to be relayed to grandma.", "Info: do you often have to help your brother out of trouble? If you are constantly solving his problems I could see your husband being extremely annoyed if that extended into your honeymoon as well", "If you can't cut the cord on your family drama long enough to go on your honeymoon, I feel sorry for your husband. Of course you will say this was an extreme situation, but your sister lives with you and it comes through loud and clear that your family dominates your life. Why do you need to make a plan with him? It is none of your business. Let him handle it, he's an adult. Your parents shouldn't have to take care of it either, but it is much more understandable if they were involved. You literally have no reason to be. YTA.", "How old are they and what was the situation", "Question - what was the purpose of the calls? They're all adults, right? Why was it your emergency? I don't understand where you even fit into their issues.", "Nah but you might need to put some boundaries with your family. It was an emergency so I get it but you\u2019re also on your honeymoon so maybe the phone calls were a bit much.", "Do it when you get back. This is your honeymoon. A time to get to know each other. Put your phone away...YTA", "YTA 100%!!! On your honeymoon and think it\u2019s ok to coddle your fragile siblings?? Red flags for your husband!!! Sometimes people need to figure things out for themselves and for your sister to call you on your honeymoon when no one has died is so childish and disrespectful! You should have told them both to just grow up and handle it and your husband probably wouldn\u2019t have been so upset and hurt!", "NAH\n\nSounds like y\u2019all were in bed about to go to sleep. So the calls wasn\u2019t interrupting anything but I do think you should\u2019ve stepped out to talk since your husband was trying to sleep which I can understand being a bit upset about other than that you did nothing wrong.", "I\u2019m not gonna say AH, but you\u2019re on your honeymoon. It\u2019s a time for you and him.", " NAH- also just a really small issue? Don\u2019t think anyone would even remember in the morning", "Yta. Can they not sort their own shit out? What exactly can you help them with here? Why can't they come up with their own plan. It doesn't seem like you work in a profession related to this. I agree with your husband, it's your honeymoon", "NTA but it is your honeymoon, you could have not spent as much time on the phone and could have left the room to let him sleep.  Why are your parents not handling this?", "Yta sry", "I disagree. What is op supposed to do for the brother? Why can't he sort his own shit out like an adult", "Seriously. My wife and I have had to handle family emergencies while on vacation, it's just a part of life. If it's that big of a deal, then save up for another vacation. Who says you can only have one honeymoon?", "She cannot disconnect for a week to spend time with her beloved, new husband.  \n\nI\u2019d happily lock my phone in a cage during a vacation.  Phones have ruined personal time", "Taking a dump and being on the phone are different things.  One is necessary, and the other isn\u2019t.", "If she spent \u201cminimal time on the phone\u201d then this post wouldn\u2019t exist", "Just because you are a busy body doesn't mean your spouse should have to deal with it on their honeymoon.", "Caring about your family doesn\u2019t make you a busy body. It makes you a loving and caring human being. If you don\u2019t have anyone in your life that you care about, that\u2019s sad but don\u2019t act like there\u2019s  something wrong with wanting to be informed that your family member is in trouble. Some of us want to support our loved ones through their struggles from beginning to end. If you can\u2019t relate, that\u2019s your problem.", "You don't need to be involved in your adult siblings lethal issues on your honeymoon lol. The trailer park will still be standing when you get back.", "I was going to say (before reading) that unless it's an emergency situation yes,  you are.\n\nBut it was an emergency situation, so no, you are not. You weren't just sitting about discussing Granny's geraniums. This stuff was not common every day it can wait til you return type stuff, from the little you described.", "NAH - but open communication and family boundaries are key for successful marriages. I would suggest talking about both with your partner. Enjoy your honeymoon!", "You do you. Your personal vendetta with phones has nothing to do with other people. If I spend ~16 hours a day with a person for weeks, it's perfectly fine to take a break and check social media, call the people you care about etc. etc. \n\nBesides, this case is actually about a family emergency. She wasn't calling them for hours, talking about the pope being catholic and bears shitting in woods.", ">In fact it seems like OP goes out of her way to avoid saying what the issue actually is which makes me think they fear that us knowing the nature of the problem might change how the post is judged.\n\n\nI got the same sense, and it made me think that the husband's actual problem is not when or how much time she's been devoting to it on the phone, but that she's been devoting any time to it at all. \n\nLike, if brother is just always in some sort of bullshit trouble with the law, and this is par for the course, I could see OP's husband getting irritated that she's engaging with it beyond how they will be directly affected. And if I was in his shoes and that were the case, I would maybe be reconsidering my marriage knowing that my life would just be filled with Brother-in-Law's bullshit because my spouse has bad boundaries and brings it home.", "What if she uses the phone while pooping? Or while he is sleeping? Your personal issues with phones are subjective and, like I said - your issues. I don't know what kind of romanticised or utopian expectations you have about vacations with your partner but people are actually allowed to have a break and just chill.", "YTA. Your adult siblings should be more sensible than to interrupt your honeymoon. \n\nNeither should've called you, they should've called grandma,  your husband is right to be upset. \n\nYour focus during your honeymoon is meant to be on your new spouse.\n\nIf I was your spouse I'd be very concerned", "NTA\n\n5 day's into a honeymoon, totally fine, especially if it's an emergency. Whenever my SO had a long talk on vacation, I'd use that time for myself to scroll through the phone or read a book, use it as my own alone time. He wanted to sleep? Then sleep!", "This is tough, and I don't quite know how to vote.  Normally, I'd say that unless someone was dying/died or something involving a minor child left behind that can't wait, you never take a honeymooning couple's focus off eachother.  They might go on romantic vacations again, but it's never going to be the same as their honeymoon, even if they lived together before marriage and weren't learning eachother's bodies.  If the one who's your relative can tell something's off, you tell a little white lie that you're a bit tired.  Anything else can wait until they get home.\n\nThe problem here is that the incident involved OP's home.  That made it her business, so it couldn't wait.  Once she had to be notified because of that, one thing led to another and she spent considerable time doing damage control.  At this point, she's not going to be able to completely shut the situation off in her mind and completely enjoy the honeymoon.", "INFO: Does your brother often find himself in \"emergencies\" that the family bails him out of?", "NAH\n\nId agree a honeymoon should be isolated, and no contact to family. \n\nBut an emergency is an emergency. The saying foes \u201cdont contact me unless its an emergency\u201d", "YTA\n\nThere isn\u2019t anything you could do to help whilst you\u2019re on honeymoon. Your involvement could have waited till you got back. \n\nI can understand your new husband being upset with you. He\u2019ll be wondering if this is how it\u2019s always going to be? Your family taking priority over him. Not a good start.", "NAH. I can understand both your desire to support your family, and your husband\u2019s desire to spent time with his wife on his honeymoon.", "YTA He was trying to \u201csleep\u201d. Um, they were in bed. Together. On their honeymoon. \nAt night. He may have been interested in other common nocturnal honeymoon activities but then the phone rings and he gets treated to 30 min with the sister. No one is dead. No one is hurt. No one is in jail. There was no reason for the sister to call. She could have texted. Then OP goes 30 min with the brother. Same- no blood, no jail. Could have waited until the morning. Then she calls grandma so grandma can get looped into the family drama for close to another 30. Hubby has now lost interest in the honeymoon and actually went to sleep. And OP wonders if she is TA. YTA\n\nSister should have either texted or waited until morning. Brother was not in jail, the hospital, or the morgue. OP is inserting herself into brothers legal drama for next week from her honeymoon. Wow.", "It\u2019s just such a shame that OP left and there wasn\u2019t a single adult left to handle things. /s\n\nYTA. Your family needs to be allowed to grow up.", "To be fair I fully expect to be called about the cops coming to my house and why. The brother thing is debatable", "Deeply hurt that her family wanted her to enjoy her once in a lifetime honeymoon?  Give me the untainted honeymoon memories and then I\u2019ll deal with the family drama when I get back. \n\nEspecially if they only have a couple of days left before they get back.", "Nobody is shitty here and everyone is shutty here were the tags before reddit changed it for advertisers", "Depends on the sibling. If my brother was a habitual trouble maker I would be pissed if my honeymoon was soured because he got in trouble again."]}
