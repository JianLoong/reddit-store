Our older son lives with him and younger with me.  We are both not high income but he somehow landed a wife who makes 4x our income and they often go out of the country on nice vacations which I guess he has been sharing with the kids.\n\nThe kids want their passports now thanks to his brainwashing. I initially said yes because him and my son caught me off guard and started asking me if it was okay one day.  Then I had time to think about it and realized how bad things are in the world right now and I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth the risk and danger having the kids so far away from me and out of the country with their dad and stepmom.  They also need my consent per our custody agreement to go out of the country anyway, and at this point I\u2019d never say yes.\n\nSo today when my ex asked me if X date was okay for the passport appointment I asked where he is even going to be taking the kids, to which he told me \u201che didn\u2019t know yet, they just want to get the ball rolling because it takes 3 months just to get the passport and they haven\u2019t planned anything specific yet\u201d which I find sketchy.\n\nSo I told him and the kids no, that he needs my consent to take them anywhere because of how bad the world is right now and I\u2019d never agree so passports are pointless.  My younger son got upset and my ex got angry also and kept repeating \u201care you just never going to allow them to go anywhere then?\u201d I never said that, just not right now.\n\nSo my ex is texting me now saying I\u2019m an asshole and I\u2019m \u201crobbing my kids of experiences\u201d except I never have gone out of the country and don\u2019t have a passport and I am fine, so I don\u2019t really buy it.  Like does a 7 year old and a 14 year old really need to experience japan or england or whatever, they can go when they are 18 and probably appreciate it more then. Other than some initial disappointment my kids haven\u2019t even mentioned it to me again so I have a feeling they don\u2019t really care and it\u2019s more their dad influencing them.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1692461145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vk4ne/aita_for_not_allowing_my_ex_to_get_the_kids_their/", "score": 848, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get it. My parents always touted how had the world was. You would die if you left America. Guess what\u2026THAT is brainwashing. When I went out of state the first time I spent a month in Africa. It was AMAZING!! I was 21. My parents yelled about how I was going to die. My parents tried to convince me that I would never come back home bc I would be kidnapped by rebels and be turned into a slave. (None of their fears occurred.) When I went to Mexico the first time my parents were against it bc what if something happens to you out of the country. Europe they weren\u2019t as scared of but really by this time frame I had been out of the country enough for them to know\u2026life goes on. My dad has never been out of the country out of fear. My mom has been to Canada once. If your husband wanted to take them to Afghanistan\u2026I could see you saying no. But Japan?!?! If I had the money I would totally be taking my kids all over the world. They could learn about other countries, cultures, customs and such.

It's not my dad.....", "YTA- this boils down to jealousy plain and simple.  It is understandable that you want your kids safe but you can\u2019t keep them wrapped in bubble wrap.  Exploring the world is an eye opening experience and you are denying them this experience.  I would understand if you were worried your ex is a flight risk and has another country to go back to but you didn\u2019t make that clear.

Our older son lives with him and younger with me.  We are both not high income but he somehow landed a wife who makes 4x our income and they often go out of the country on nice vacations which I guess he has been sharing with the kids.\n\nThe kids want their passports now thanks to his brainwashing. I initially said yes because him and my son caught me off guard and started asking me if it was okay one day.  Then I had time to think about it and realized how bad things are in the world right now and I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth the risk and danger having the kids so far away from me and out of the country with their dad and stepmom.  They also need my consent per our custody agreement to go out of the country anyway, and at this point I\u2019d never say yes.\n\nSo today when my ex asked me if X date was okay for the passport appointment I asked where he is even going to be taking the kids, to which he told me \u201che didn\u2019t know yet, they just want to get the ball rolling because it takes 3 months just to get the passport and they haven\u2019t planned anything specific yet\u201d which I find sketchy.\n\nSo I told him and the kids no, that he needs my consent to take them anywhere because of how bad the world is right now and I\u2019d never agree so passports are pointless.  My younger son got upset and my ex got angry also and kept repeating \u201care you just never going to allow them to go anywhere then?\u201d I never said that, just not right now.\n\nSo my ex is texting me now saying I\u2019m an asshole and I\u2019m \u201crobbing my kids of experiences\u201d except I never have gone out of the country and don\u2019t have a passport and I am fine, so I don\u2019t really buy it.  Like does a 7 year old and a 14 year old really need to experience japan or england or whatever, they can go when they are 18 and probably appreciate it more then. Other than some initial disappointment my kids haven\u2019t even mentioned it to me again so I have a feeling they don\u2019t really care and it\u2019s more their dad influencing them.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
