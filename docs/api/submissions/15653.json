Now, my wife is a cat person, I'm a dog person. She has 3 cats and I have a dog. I interact with her cats and think they're pretty cool (though it's taken them a while to warm up to me), whereas she truly just doesn't like my dog- for reasons that are justified (I simply have a higher patience and tolerance level where as my wife expects perfect listening skills- which is unrealistic). Though I'm willing to admit she has never asked me to re-home her outside of one single occurrence back awhile ago (which was said out of frustration). \n\nNow on to the issue.. my wife is currently pregnant with our 4th (and last). She is a SAHM, home schools our kids, grows out own food and generally keeps the house clean. This isn't due to me asking or expecting it from her but she just generally enjoys it. She only just became a SAHM when COVID hit and honestly, life has been fantastic. Less stress (she even says the same). But again, she's currently pregnant. She can no longer clean the cat box. The kids (triplets) are too young to clean the cat box. It gets stinky quick and gives her migraines. Because of my long hours and generally being completely exhausted when I get home, I usually forget to clean it myself. I know that's a me problem but given that it is a safety issue for my wife, I think rehoming them (at least until end of pregnancy) is the best option, so I suggested it to her. She's 20 weeks so it wouldn't be a god awful length of time to re-home them before she got them back anyhow. \n\nShe lost it however. She told me that I'm selfish in expecting her to re-home her cats because I \"don't want to pick up one chore around the house\". That truly isn't the case though. I truly forget because of how exhausted I am when I get home. She then started that it \"would be a cold day in hell that she rehomes her cats when I get to keep a dog that no one wants but me\". I will admit that the kids have zero interest in the dog. Like, none whatsoever. But they all love the cats, so maybe I AM in the wrong. However, I was truly thinking of it from a safety aspect of things and she just seems to think I'm being selfish.

I interact with her cats and think they're pretty cool (though it's taken them a while to warm up to me), whereas she truly just doesn't like my dog- for reasons that are justified (I simply have a higher patience and tolerance level where as my wife expects perfect listening skills- which is unrealistic). Though I'm willing to admit she has never asked me to re-home her outside of one single occurrence back awhile ago (which was said of our frustration). \n\nNow on to the issue.. my wife is currently pregnant with our 4th (and last). She is a SAHM, home schools our kids, grows out own food and generally keeps the house clean. This isn't due to me asking or expecting it from her but she just generally enjoys it. She only just became a SAHM when COVID hit and honestly, live has been fantastic. Less stress (she even says the same). But again, she's currently pregnant. She can no longer clean the cat box. The kids (triplets) are too young to clean the cat box. It gets stinky quick and gives her migraines. Because of my long hours and generally being completely exhausted when I get home, I usually forget to clean it myself. I know that's a me problem but given that it is a safety issue for my wife, I think rehoming them (at least until end of pregnancy) is the best option, so I suggested it to her. She's 20 weeks so it wouldn't be a god awful length of time to re-home them before she got them back anyhow. \n\nShe lost it however. She told me that I'm selfish in expecting her to re-home her cats because I \"don't want to pick up one chore around the house\". That truly isn't the case though. I truly forget because of how exhausted I am when I get home. She then started that it \"would be a cold day in hell that she rehomes her cats when I get to keep a dog that no one wants but me\". I will admit that the kids have zero interest in the dog. Like, none whatsoever. But they all love the cats, so maybe I AM in the wrong. However, I was truly thinking of it from a safety aspect of things and she just seems to think I'm being selfish. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Second this!", "Yep, there is one thing that made me very suspicious about the dog myself and I am a cat owner but also own a German boxer dog - and my dog is trained but she can be stubborn as well and I need to repeat commands quite authoritatively, therefore I can actually fully understand the point about the 100% trained dog, although it is stupid to say it wouldn't be possible but that either needs a very strict household with everyone being consequent and a lot of time, or abuse. \n\nThe thing is his kids aren't interested in the dog. I mean really? Come on... what kids who grow up with a dog aren't interested in it at all? Sounds like they might even dislike it. Well, I grew up with cats, dogs and other small animals and I was interested in every single one, even the self rescue cat of my dad that liked to scratch me in the beginning (probably had negative experiences). And I don't know any kid, neither of my childhood nor now that wouldn't like a family pet without reason - not, again, when they grew up with it.", "What strikes me is that it\u2019s such a small ask. It\u2019s literally just the one thing he\u2019s being asked to do for a limited amount of time to support his pregnant spouse, for whom continuing to do it would go against medical guidance. He\u2019s the father of the baby, but he cannot do ONE THING to help out while she\u2019s pregnant? And he upsets her suggesting they get rid of pets that she and the children are emotionally attached to? Did he honestly think that WOULDN\u2019T upset her? YTA for sure.", "Yeah I just can\u2019t understand how he can ask her to rehome her cats so carelessly. If he loved her he wouldn\u2019t think about it :(", "Seriously. This man needs to just get on Rover and pay the price for the next however many weeks for both his dog and the cat box. There is zero reason his preggers and busy as hell wife needs to be taking care of his dog that he gets to \"fun parent.\"", "Yuuuup. 100%.", "Holy shit I missed that. He really said that??? Damn.", "I have the cat genie and I love it! Tell me more about this hacking tho... those cartridges are pricy", "I plan to get one when I move out for sure. Due to my back and knees it's hard to scoop a box anymore.", "I have 2 boxes, a litter robot and a standard tray. I herniated a disc in my low back a couple of months ago and couldn\u2019t bend or twist at all. There\u2019s a litter scooper by Sandpiper originally intended to looks for shells, but it is perfect as a litter scooper if you can\u2019t get down to litter box level. It comes in different lengths.", "YTA. I have ADHD too, and it\u2019s really shitty when people like you use it as a crutch to get out of responsibility and then proceed to make it someone else\u2019s problem. If alarms aren\u2019t working, put post-it notes with reminders around for you. You have to work with your disability, not against it. Cope. Your wife does EVERYTHING at home already - you\u2019re seriously saying that you can\u2019t step up and find tactics that work with your brain to remind yourself to do ONE chore? Get a grip.", "Just to be clear.. you're working one job, and your wife is:\n\n* a house cleaner / maid\n* a nanny (read: parent)\n* a gardener / grocer\n* a teacher\n\nAnd, I have no doubt, she's also the one who cooks all the meals. So, add Cook / Chef there as well. Oh, and of course there's the little thing about GROWING A WHOLE ASS HUMAN INSIDE OF HER. \n\nBut *you're* the one that is too tired to.. clean out a litterbox? \n\nRiiiiight. \n\nYTA. Obviously.", "Right??? \nI nearly fell off the chair when I read this post! \n100% she should look at rehoming him - just for 20 weeks or so. /s\nDefinitely YTA OP. Big time.", "Also: sounds like his dog isn't well trained at ALL and he's just not admitting it... \"dogs will be dogs\" sorta easy like \"boys will be boys\"....", "Without hesitation and my partner is actually helpful too", "So many people are rightly pointing out what an ass this guy is for logistical reasons, totally skipping over the fact that *people are bonded with their pets*. An animal can be a huge part of someone's life! I've known my cat for half my life and would be devastated if someone took her away. Regardless of how easy it is for the husband to step up and take care of things, the fact that his instinct is to just get rid of the cats is a huge red flag-- guy has no empathy and no understanding of his wife's feelings. Rehome the husband.", "Question is how many days. Is it 4 days or 7?", "I have ADHD and sometimes have trouble keeping up with the litter boxes. To make up for it, I had twice as many litter boxes as recommended when I had the space for it. I don't have the space for that now, so I bought a litter box that hooks up to my laundry connections and flushes the poop down the waste drain. OP just isn't trying.", "Men with this profile often display other troubling behavior. Like slowly isolating a partner from all sources of joy. Friends, family, hobbies, self care routines, nonpreferred pets, all represent a drain on the attention they believe they are solely entitled to. S", "Or first thing in the morning!  Then he doesn\u2019t have to bother if he\u2019s tired from work.  It\u2019s like the smallest chore.  Unreal.", "Not to mention \u201eenjoying\u201c doing chores around the house while growing food, growing a human, and teaching three little ones. Seriously, I cannot even name one person who enjoys doing all of the chores. And that\u2019s without all the additional stressors.\n\nSo, YTA, my dude. You should at least be doing half the household chores and half triplet duties. I don\u2019t care how tired you are. Your poor wife is probably exhausted by having to live life as your live-in maid. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she ended up considering divorce at some point.", "Yes he's definitely the AH. He's asking her to give up her pets because he can't take a few minutes of the day to clean.\n\nAnd for OP, let me help you with remembering:  set a reminder on your phone/watch.  Put a sticky note on your door. Make a beautiful magnetic chore chart and hang it in plain sight. Voila. My kids, who are presumably much younger than you, do daily chores and use various means to remember.", "\"slightly unfavorable\" = \"the dog is an obnoxious, untrainable brute that is hated by everyone but me\"", "Wow. Just\u2026 wow. A dog he specifically wanted, that\u2019s still very much a YOUNG dog, when he works long hours AND THEY HAVE TRIPLETS. \n\nDude. YTA. Massively.", "Grrrrr I am also home all day with an untrained dog that isn't mine, and I am RESENTFUL AF about it. And I'm just trying to work at home. If I had three kids, pregnancy exhaustion, and 43255 chores to do as well as gardening? No. That's choosing violence.", "That too. So he's perfectly fine letting her do something that's a *major* risk factor for toxoplasmosis, but insisted she not do the (relatively) minorly risky one, but also can't be arsed to do it himself because it's an ever so slight inconvenience and just wants to re-home the cats instead. Something tells me that it's less about the risks and more about OP not liking them and not wanting his wife to have something that makes her happy that's inconvenient for him.", "My OB said the same thing, indoor cats are way less risky than outdoor gardening.", "Six cat household, plus fosters, here, and I have 5 Litter Robots and they are absolutely worth every penny. I can go a few days without needing to empty them, which is great, and the cats stay happy with the boxes being constantly clean. I've had dozens of foster cats and all of them have happily used the Litter Robots (some of the more skittish momcats I've had to introduce more carefully, but they all get used to it within a day or so).\n\nAnd yes, their customer service is fantastic, and they are pretty user-serviceable if anything does malfunction. I had a globe fail (pretty sure the little magnet that cues the sensor somehow fell off) when I was well out of warranty, and they gave me 25% of a replacement just to be nice.\n\nI'm definitely considering expanding the robot army with a LR4, they look so swanky.", "  Who needs a litter box reminder? The reminder is the smell of cat shit!", "Yeah, coming in and scooping the litter daily is the kind of job a junior high school student down the street would do for five bucks a day.", "Yeah, this is a sweeping generalization but it takes a lot for 3 small children to all have (his words) no interest whatsoever in a dog.", "There\u2019s even the option of paying someone else to come daily and scoop it. SMH. So many options.", "I fully accept that housework can be enjoyable.  I also fully doubt OP is a trustworthy judge of if his wife enjoys it.", "\"Division of labor.\" She's doing 100%, obviously. Easiest math ever!", "It's definitely not yours vs mine for the pets, she's taking care of his dog as well", "I\u2019m a dog person and my wife is a cat person. She came with one and he attacked my face the second day he was here, attacked my blind and deaf elderly dog on the third day. So we haven\u2019t been the best of friends and taking care of the cat box was her job. When she was diagnosed with cancer and had to go through chemo and wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the litter box I definitely did not suggest rehoming him. I mean, chemo and radiation were about 7 months, that\u2019s not that long, right? Sheesh. I got a litter robot because I can\u2019t stand the litter box, plus it wasn\u2019t something that was in my normal routine so I\u2019d forget about it and then he\u2019d pee on the carpet. Best 500 bucks we ever spent. YTA, find a better solution that works for everyone.", "Weaponized incompetence at its finest", "If OP is \u201ctruly\u201d forgetting to clean the litter box, then he \u201ctruly\u201d needs to find a way to remember. But nope, his solution is to rehome the cats.", "He said in another comment that her doctor \u201cblew it out of proportion,\u201d so that\u2019s a good start lol.", "This is so interesting to me. It\u2019s very telling that the kids like the cats, but do not like to play with a dog. If the kids were born at the beginning of the Covid pandemic, then they would be about three which would mean that OP somehow thought it was a good idea to get a puppy when he had six month old triplets.\n \nINFO: Op can you give us a timeline of when the cats came into yall\u2019s lives? and the triplets? and the dog?  \n\nActually, looks like the kids are older if they are already being home schooled.  Even still, getting a rambunctious puppy when you have three small children is a dubious choice.\n\nHonestly, if your wife has had the cats for a long time, and they are her comfort, then asking her to rehome them when she\u2019s in a very uncomfortable state is a major AH move.", "Wow.... Just wow.  I am single with animals and I make sure I have time to train and play with my dogs after long work days.  That's just what you do. And walking in every day and cleaning the cat litter takes a couple minutes.  Hey a litter ginnie so you don't have to run a bag out to the trash all the time.  I'll be waiting for her side of this story which will probably have way more information.", "This needed to be higher as it was my first thought!", "Doesn\u2019t solve the husband problem, but my doc said when I was expecting that, as long as I used a good pair of gloves and took them off carefully once the job was done, scooping the litter was fine. Disposable surgical gloves, removed by pulling off from inside wrists and dropped in the trash did the trick. Easy solution", "Yeah I have 4 cats.. we have 5 litter boxes. It's a lot but 0 accidents! 3 different placements.", "That\u2019s a good possibility", "I wonder who walks the dog? Takes it out for poops? Does she do that as well?", "He said she does in a comment. \n\nSo she is taking care of his dog she doesn't even like, but he can't do 1 thing to care for her cats?", "Lmfao I can agree with you from the opposite end- I have 3 dogs and 1 cat! \ud83d\ude02 the dogs are definitely more labor intensive!", "You win the comments", "I have four kids under 14 and just listening to what OP's wife does makes me tired \ud83d\udc40\n\nAnd we have a big garden too", "Worth its weight in gold! I have 3 of them."]}
