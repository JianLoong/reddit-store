Why don't you look into it\".\n\nSo I did.\n\nFast forward two months ago and her mom can't go so her and her sister decided to downgrade the vacation to something smaller. \n\nBut now her sister is being nonchalant about the trip and not answering any questions really about planning it or really putting forth any effort. A couple of weeks ago she even said \"now watch I can't go, but you do!\" \n\nI got my cousin down for the idea and now he's joining and we have hotel booked and are looking at flights and cars. \n\nWell today she came home and I've been talking alot about it recently and i brought up another thing i might do today and now she's letting her feelings be known. \n\nShe's upset that I'm considering going somewhere for an entire week when her trip might not get to happen and since I only get one week vacation time I should be planning it with her and our daughter.

You could plan a couples trip with her somewhere, or just take her on a few hour drive to hike somewhere or see a town or something together. Her adventure was ruined and now she's stuck with nothing and I get that she's being a bit if an AH because she doesn't want you to have fun since she can't, but that's probably a lot of disappointment and jealousy that she can't reschedule speaking, so its understandable imo.", "NTA.  \n\nYou have done NOTHING wrong.
