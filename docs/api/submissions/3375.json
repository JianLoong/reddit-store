Rearranging the furniture without asking or having an agreement with the owners is an asshole move.

Mine takes place at a local yarn shop, with tables dedicated to meeting spaces. We don't take anything away from the shop's profits and, let's be honest, often end up buying more than we normally would because we're surrounded by all that color and fiber.\n\nYou're not a dedicated space for such things.

When I lived in Chicago, people would nurse one cup for hours and hog tables. They'd use extra tables to store their electronics.

There is not enough information in your post to tell if their meetings were costing your coffee shop any money.  If them occupying so much space every week caused you to lose business, because customers could not find a place to sit, then you made the right call to talk to them about it.  If you had not noticed any drop in business on those days, however, then it would have been kind to let them continue to hold the meetings there.  A middle ground would possibly have been to let them know that you were happy to have them, but if it became busy during their meeting you might need to take some of the tables and chairs back.\n\nNo matter what, I don't think you are TA, since you are the manager and you have the right to ask large groups not to take up so much space for so long while only buying 1 cup of coffee each.", "INFO:\n\nWhat is the actual store/company policy?  Is there a time limit for customers being in the store if they only order one item?  Are customers allowed to move tables?", "NTA, you are a manager, in your position it was your responsibility to say something to that group. While I understand the struggle acutely how hard it is to find free public spaces, the issue here is that it's costing the business money, and the amount of space they are monopolizing is inappropriate given how little they are spending.\n\nIt also feels inappropriate to me that he came up to you entirely to guilt you on that point, when this isn't a public space. It is a space people are supposed to pay to have a seat in, or they move on. The fact that an assistant manager was telling you that you should feel bad about doing your job and not costing the business money when you are in charge seems more like a business issue than a moral one", "[removed]", "NTA but it doesn\u2019t really matter if you are or not if your manager has an issue with your action.", "NTA but you could have told them they needed to order more of they want that much space.", "INFO:  Who owns this coffee shop?  You should have discussed your concerns with the owner first  and found out who was the actual organizer.\n\nWe actually had this happen with a book group I'm in.  We started meeting at a place and it was fine at first.   Then the owner decided that community groups were taking up too much table space and asked us to move upstairs to a really dingy room.   This was just before lockdown so we changed to ZOOM.  We've recently decided to rotate meetings, some at people's homes and some at places of interest.", "Ever so slightly, YTA because there were better ways to intervene such as, but not limited to, asking customers not to rearrange the tables. If you make it a bit more awkward for them, then they'll be less inclined to linger for so long. You could have also asked them if they wanted to be on an official schedule/board with a designated space. Then you could have controlled the use of seating a little better. You could have also made the timeframe more concrete--maybe that hint would have worked, maybe not. But yeah, betters ways to intervene. Coffee houses have become places to hunker down and do work and that's a shame. They used to be social gathering places.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't want to create an environment as a manager where people feel like they can't give you feedback.

These are adults, selfishly hoarding all of the seats for hours without buying an appropriate level of goods, to receive the services they were receiving.\n\nThe coffee shop is a COFFEE SHOP, not a craft room, community center, or a hobby hall. The social deal is you buy a product, and you can use the space. That\u2019s the deal. We all know this.\n\nIt\u2019s not spend $2.59, and camp for 3 hours with 10 of your friends every week.

If you regularly had customers that didn\u2019t have seating because of this group, or if they directly impacted your business in some other way, then asking them to find another place to gather would be justified.\n\nI\u2019m probably biased, because I\u2019m part of a group that does a similar thing (once a month, the Deaf community in my area has a \u201cSign and Dine\u201d at a local restaurant / cafe / food court).  Yeah, we get some weird looks and stares and people talk about us, and we push a bunch of tables together and usually hang out for 2+ hours, but we aren\u2019t hurting anyone and we try to patronize local businesses when we do this.\n\nIf we were asked to leave because other customers looked annoyed\u2026  I mean, why is one customer\u2019s comfort more important than another\u2019s?  And how do you draw the line?  If a customer looks annoyed by someone who is stimming or has tics, does that mean they should be asked to leave?", "Because they are profit oriented entities - and the manager owes reasonable attempts at making a profit to the owner.", "When other customers are actively spending money and you are not.  That's the line.  If you are there for two hours, you should be continuously buying food and drinks to 'rent' your table.  If all your food and drink ia gone, but more or leave.  If you buy one drink and sit for four hours, you are stopping them from turning that table into other sales.  Maybe people won't come in if they can't get a table, or if they are forced to wait longer to be seated. Maybe they would have bought multiple drinks while they lingered.", "I used to work in a small pub and every Thursday night a group of 12-15 people would come in, push all the tables in the side room together, about half of them would get a single soft drink and play one of those tabletop games like WoW or something all night.       \nI'd have people coming in wanting to eat a meal, see there's no seats and leave.        \nWe absolutely put a stop to it.        \nThose tables are there so my boss can earn a living, not so a bunch of people have somewhere large and warm to play games for \u00a31.50 a night each.", "NTA.\n\nI was once part of a knitting group that met in a small coffee shop.

We used to have a Bible study do something similar at my coffee shop and my managers refused to do anything about it. Granted they didn't take up 75% of the tables but eventually only one or two of them would actually purchase drinks and the rest would just sit there. They also had no issues moving the tables together but never actually put them back where they found them.", "NTA. Your AM does not understand a business needs turnover for profit. Some coffee shops have an hour time limit on tables.", "NTA. I used to manage a coffee shop and those people were the bane of my existence. People acted like we were a bar and they could stay there for eight hours and buy a single coffee. The owner wouldn't let me kick them out even though they were clearly running off other customers.", "NTA. My knitting group met at a coffee place for a while pre-roni. We asked beforehand, used the large group table they have for gatherings. Everyone bought a drink and a snack typically, we cleaned our own table, and we limited our time to 2 hours at most.\n\nThis group sounds a little obnoxious.", "NTA\n\n\nI was *very* briefly in food service so I may be mistaken, but where I worked there was an expected amount of money that was supposed to be generated per seat, per hour. \n\n\nI realize that may differ in a coffee house but I think that\u2019s worth looking into. If a seat generates, on average, $10 per hour (just an example), and these women are getting a $5 drink and sitting over 4 hours, their seats are only generating $1.25 an hour. That\u2019s $8.75 of lost revenue per hour, per seat. You\u2019re running a *business* so losing out on $35 *per seat* is an issue. \n\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind\u2026don\u2019t let the fact that they\u2019re \u201csweet old ladies\u201d change your opinion.

However, with a small family-run business, I would recommend offering them delivery to the community center..? Or some other token that can be done easily. Little old ladies spread a lot of word-of-mouth.  And some kind of nice gesture might get the community on your side as well.", "And they knew it was rude.", "That seems reasonable.

Sucked.", "Yeah. However, this is way worse. This is not a global company with billions in profits. This is a local coffee shop. Having these ladies take over so much space for so long and only ordering one drink each while being loud can take a bigger toll on their weekly profit.", "Funny you mentioned Starbucks because I bet anything that's where the ladies met Before this. In fact, I knew several people who've been in knitting/stitch and bitch groups and they all met in various Starbucks.\nI wonder if Maybe they were decent enough not to support such a labor busting company, but they also have to consider not monopolizing all the space in a local shop and driving away other business!\nNTA", "I\u2019ve sat next to that guy before lol.", "When I worked at Starbucks, there was a guy who would come in and take our largest table for his laptop and, I swear to god, printer/scanner/fax machine combo.", "Starbucks is a shit hole", "But no one went to managment.\nIf they pay they can be a bit annoying imo they are them paying customer's.\nNow they only use free space while thee tables can be used by people who pay", "Because it\u2019s even more important that a local shop run it this way.
