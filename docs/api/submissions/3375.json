If you had not noticed any drop in business on those days, however, then it would have been kind to let them continue to hold the meetings there.  A middle ground would possibly have been to let them know that you were happy to have them, but if it became busy during their meeting you might need to take some of the tables and chairs back.\n\nNo matter what, I don't think you are TA, since you are the manager and you have the right to ask large groups not to take up so much space for so long while only buying 1 cup of coffee each.", "INFO:\n\nWhat is the actual store/company policy?

It is a space people are supposed to pay to have a seat in, or they move on.

If you make it a bit more awkward for them, then they'll be less inclined to linger for so long. You could have also asked them if they wanted to be on an official schedule/board with a designated space. Then you could have controlled the use of seating a little better. You could have also made the timeframe more concrete--maybe that hint would have worked, maybe not. But yeah, betters ways to intervene.

If a seat generates, on average, $10 per hour (just an example), and these women are getting a $5 drink and sitting over 4 hours, their seats are only generating $1.25 an hour. That\u2019s $8.75 of lost revenue per hour, per seat.
