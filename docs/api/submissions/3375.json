You run a business, not a community center.

Any overstay really should be managed.", "NTA- one item per person for 4 hours of space isn\u2019t fair. The least they could do is offer a head fee for each person there to use the space.", "They should have asked about basing their club there and they could have been told how much they were expected to spend in return.

You are a business, not a community center.", "NTA. As adults, they should know better. It\u2019s rude to patronize so many tables for an extended amount of time ordering practically nothing. There are other venues for them to use.", "NTA. It\u2019s a business and they\u2019re preventing other customers from using that space for hours while only ordering one drink and disturbing other patrons (I\u2019ve been around knitting clubs and they can be pretty loud). You did what you\u2019re supposed to do as a manager, they can get together in a public space or in one of their homes.", "NTA. Rearranging the furniture without asking or having an agreement with the owners is an asshole move. You\u2019re completely correct that they should seek out a community space rather than inhibiting a business from allowing other patrons to use the space", "I got recruited into a local knitting group recently and I have to say NTA. Mine takes place at a local yarn shop, with tables dedicated to meeting spaces. We don't take anything away from the shop's profits and, let's be honest, often end up buying more than we normally would because we're surrounded by all that color and fiber.\n\nYou're not a dedicated space for such things. These people are moving your furniture around and taking advantage of your location with no benefit or added community to your shop.", "NTA-Let them meet up at someone\u2019s home or reserve a space in a community building.", "NTA. When I lived in Chicago, people would nurse one cup for hours and hog tables. They'd use extra tables to store their electronics. Some of them didn't buy anything but hogged tables anyway so they could use the WiFi. The baristas never did anything, but they always screamed at the homeless people to get out. It infuriated me that they had a double standard.", "This is why Caribou coffees with conference rooms charge 25/hr to rent it. Many buy a gift card n use it to buy the drinks for the meeting. As a customer I would avoid a cafe if I saw that. Like not even walk in as I\u2019d feel I was disturbing the group.\n\nNTA\n\nEdited for spelling", "Not the asshole.

Meeting for 1 hour with a drink each is fine, but no more than that.", "I think you are NTA, necessarily, but I also am not sure you needed to ask them to leave.  There is not enough information in your post to tell if their meetings were costing your coffee shop any money.  If them occupying so much space every week caused you to lose business, because customers could not find a place to sit, then you made the right call to talk to them about it.  If you had not noticed any drop in business on those days, however, then it would have been kind to let them continue to hold the meetings there.  A middle ground would possibly have been to let them know that you were happy to have them, but if it became busy during their meeting you might need to take some of the tables and chairs back.\n\nNo matter what, I don't think you are TA, since you are the manager and you have the right to ask large groups not to take up so much space for so long while only buying 1 cup of coffee each.", "INFO:\n\nWhat is the actual store/company policy?  Is there a time limit for customers being in the store if they only order one item?  Are customers allowed to move tables?", "NTA, you are a manager, in your position it was your responsibility to say something to that group. While I understand the struggle acutely how hard it is to find free public spaces, the issue here is that it's costing the business money, and the amount of space they are monopolizing is inappropriate given how little they are spending.\n\nIt also feels inappropriate to me that he came up to you entirely to guilt you on that point, when this isn't a public space. It is a space people are supposed to pay to have a seat in, or they move on. The fact that an assistant manager was telling you that you should feel bad about doing your job and not costing the business money when you are in charge seems more like a business issue than a moral one", "[removed]", "NTA but it doesn\u2019t really matter if you are or not if your manager has an issue with your action.", "NTA but you could have told them they needed to order more of they want that much space.", "INFO:  Who owns this coffee shop?  You should have discussed your concerns with the owner first  and found out who was the actual organizer.\n\nWe actually had this happen with a book group I'm in.  We started meeting at a place and it was fine at first.   Then the owner decided that community groups were taking up too much table space and asked us to move upstairs to a really dingy room.   This was just before lockdown so we changed to ZOOM.  We've recently decided to rotate meetings, some at people's homes and some at places of interest.", "Ever so slightly, YTA because there were better ways to intervene such as, but not limited to, asking customers not to rearrange the tables. If you make it a bit more awkward for them, then they'll be less inclined to linger for so long. You could have also asked them if they wanted to be on an official schedule/board with a designated space. Then you could have controlled the use of seating a little better. You could have also made the timeframe more concrete--maybe that hint would have worked, maybe not. But yeah, betters ways to intervene. Coffee houses have become places to hunker down and do work and that's a shame. They used to be social gathering places.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The ladies cost sales, lower sales mean cost cutting measures and that means layoffs.", "Their comment should be one data point among many when considering their evaluation. You don't want to create an environment as a manager where people feel like they can't give you feedback. And assistant managers in small coffee shops aren't very powerful nor usually very experienced. It is better to train someone who shows promise than harshly punish someone for a comment you disagree with (assuming they are willing to uphold policies).", "If a single question or difference of opinion triggers something major like this, no employee will talk to you openly anymore. You won't create effective team that way, you will create scared team that way. And I have seen exact that process in work, it is not just theoretical.\n\nMoreover OP thought about that idea seriously. That would make op unsuitable too. By all means, talk with the employee or say no or whatever. Top management sets culture and decision making, there is no reason to overreact or punish people for voiced difference in evaluating the situation.", "one famous cafe in my area has a 'sit down' area for long duration single drink buyers. they have a crowded area for the movealongs and they push their regular patrons, who nurse a drink for hours and laptop to their heart's content, into a designated (cordoned) area.", "She is the manager. But I agree they should come up with a policy so they\u2019re not challenged about this.", "Good question. There isn\u2019t a policy because it\u2019s a small family owned shop and for the past couple of years, we haven\u2019t even had indoor gathering spaces available because of the pandemic. So, there isn\u2019t a policy or really institutional memory of any kind.", "No place to sit in the coffee shop can turn away customers. They\u2019re taking up most of the space for several hours and only getting one drink each in that time. Not exactly a leap in logic to say it\u2019s costing the shop business.", "Wait. Why? These are adults, selfishly hoarding all of the seats for hours without buying an appropriate level of goods, to receive the services they were receiving.\n\nThe coffee shop is a COFFEE SHOP, not a craft room, community center, or a hobby hall. The social deal is you buy a product, and you can use the space. That\u2019s the deal. We all know this.\n\nIt\u2019s not spend $2.59, and camp for 3 hours with 10 of your friends every week. Do you know how much it would cost to rent an event room once a week for 10 people for 3-4 hours? More than the $22.50 the group was paying in coffee.", "She\u2019s a manager.

Right?", "Yeah then you'll definitely have to be part of instituting a policy.

If you regularly had customers that didn\u2019t have seating because of this group, or if they directly impacted your business in some other way, then asking them to find another place to gather would be justified.\n\nI\u2019m probably biased, because I\u2019m part of a group that does a similar thing (once a month, the Deaf community in my area has a \u201cSign and Dine\u201d at a local restaurant / cafe / food court).  Yeah, we get some weird looks and stares and people talk about us, and we push a bunch of tables together and usually hang out for 2+ hours, but we aren\u2019t hurting anyone and we try to patronize local businesses when we do this.\n\nIf we were asked to leave because other customers looked annoyed\u2026  I mean, why is one customer\u2019s comfort more important than another\u2019s?  And how do you draw the line?  If a customer looks annoyed by someone who is stimming or has tics, does that mean they should be asked to leave?", "Because they are profit oriented entities - and the manager owes reasonable attempts at making a profit to the owner.", "When other customers are actively spending money and you are not.  That's the line.  If you are there for two hours, you should be continuously buying food and drinks to 'rent' your table.  If all your food and drink ia gone, but more or leave.  If you buy one drink and sit for four hours, you are stopping them from turning that table into other sales.  Maybe people won't come in if they can't get a table, or if they are forced to wait longer to be seated. Maybe they would have bought multiple drinks while they lingered.", "I used to work in a small pub and every Thursday night a group of 12-15 people would come in, push all the tables in the side room together, about half of them would get a single soft drink and play one of those tabletop games like WoW or something all night.       \nI'd have people coming in wanting to eat a meal, see there's no seats and leave.        \nWe absolutely put a stop to it.        \nThose tables are there so my boss can earn a living, not so a bunch of people have somewhere large and warm to play games for \u00a31.50 a night each."]}
