You do have the right to ask she not be around your son.

While she may dress like that it\u2019s really not your business to demand she dress differently.  It\u2019s also a crappy reason to try and drive a wedge between the child and father/stepmother .

It\u2019s not like a sex toy that was accidentally left out and he saw, that was an intentional move on her part (and potentially your ex\u2019s as well).

That is SEXUAL ABUSE. \n\nIf you don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s sexual abuse, it\u2019s at the very least exposing your kink to a minor and unconsenting party. There is no way to spin this where that\u2019s in any way justifiable or appropriate behavior, especially in front of a child. Children cannot consent.\n\nWe can argue whether or not her wearing the butt plug around the child at all is okay behavior (I edge on the side of no, don\u2019t do kinky shit around kids or in their presence at all, even if you think you\u2019re being discrete, dead stop. It\u2019s nasty af to get off with children around), but wearing clothing that allows the child to see it? Absolutely not okay.

Just edited it lol", "It's different because she is OPENLY engaging in a sexual kink while a child is present. The child has observed this and asked the parent about it. If someone is exposing their sexual behavior to a child, especially on a regular basis, it is totally considered sexual abuse. A kid walking in on the parents doing the deed once isn't an issue. But parading around with a rhinestone buttplug in sheer extra tight yoga pants is clearly exhibitionist behavior, doing it while there is a child present and able to observe is sick. Nipple rings poking through a shirt on a random stranger is a one time deal, and sex toys in the bedroom should be put up where kids can't get into them. This is neither of those. This is purposefully driven sexual behavior in front of a child, which means the child is being allowed to observe sexual behavior, therefore, it's classified as  abuse."]}
