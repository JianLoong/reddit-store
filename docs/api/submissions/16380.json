Ok, I'm going to try to keep this short, but you do need some background info. So I (19f) live with my dad(39m) and my step mom (36 f). My step mom has two twin boys (15m). My bio mom died when I was 5 due to cancer, so my step mom basically raised me. I've never liked my step mom or step brothers. My dad always prioritized them and my step mom made sure I knew we weren't real family. Anyways when I was 12, my step mom gave me the period talk. Well when I turned 14 and still hadn't got it my dad decided they should take me to the doctor. Well they found out that I would never get my period and never would be able to have kids. This didn't bother me though because I knew I liked girls anyways. My step mom made sure to make fun of me for not being a real woman though. Well now I'm 19 and I've been getting bloody noses quite frequently. I would have to stop work to tend to these nose bleeds. Well one day on TikTok I say a thing of someone rolling toilet paper and putting it in their nose so they could still work. After I saw that it became standard practice for me. Well one day one of my step brothers decided to use my bathroom for whatever reason and saw the bloody rolled up toilet paper from my nose bleed and thought it was a tampon. He went running to his mommy and complained that it was unsanitary and disgusting. Later that night my dad and step mom sat me down and talked to me about it. Well I decided to run with it and tell them I did in fact get my period. I could tell me now being a \"real women\" made my step mom really uncomfortable. Now this is the part where may be the asshole. I started purposely disposing the rolled toilet paper in different trashcans around the house. I could tell it made everyone except my dad uncomfortable. Well my step mom finally realized it wasn't actually a tampon and comforted me about it. Well I came clean and said that was how I was dealing with my bloody noses. My step mom then blew up at me and yelled and screamed at me cause that was such a horrible thing to lie about and how I made her baby boys uncomfortable for no good reason. She then kicked me out, but behind her back my dad decided instead of arguing with her about me staying in his house he was just going to buy me an apartment. My dad has been helping me with rent here and there because I can only work part-time because of my school schedule. My step mom had no idea this is happening and me and my dad have no plans on telling her. After I moved out my step mom's family has been texting saying I'm inconsiderate asshole and I should care more about other people's feelings. This got me thinking that maybe I am the asshole.

For all intents and purposes, it was a gag.\n\nAnd, taking you at your word, it sounds like it was a well-deserved prank on some horrible people.\n\nBesides, I've seen folks use *actual tampons* for nose bleeds and other minor scrapes and stuff.

So, she can't kick you out if something happens to your dad.", "NTA, and honestly, she sounds like an evil step-mother from some medieval fairytale anyway.
