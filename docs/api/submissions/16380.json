Ok, I'm going to try to keep this short, but you do need some background info. So I (19f) live with my dad(39m) and my step mom (36 f). My step mom has two twin boys (15m). My bio mom died when I was 5 due to cancer, so my step mom basically raised me. I've never liked my step mom or step brothers. My dad always prioritized them and my step mom made sure I knew we weren't real family. Anyways when I was 12, my step mom gave me the period talk. Well when I turned 14 and still hadn't got it my dad decided they should take me to the doctor. Well they found out that I would never get my period and never would be able to have kids. This didn't bother me though because I knew I liked girls anyways. My step mom made sure to make fun of me for not being a real woman though. Well now I'm 19 and I've been getting bloody noses quite frequently. I would have to stop work to tend to these nose bleeds. Well one day on TikTok I say a thing of someone rolling toilet paper and putting it in their nose so they could still work. After I saw that it became standard practice for me. Well one day one of my step brothers decided to use my bathroom for whatever reason and saw the bloody rolled up toilet paper from my nose bleed and thought it was a tampon. He went running to his mommy and complained that it was unsanitary and disgusting. Later that night my dad and step mom sat me down and talked to me about it. Well I decided to run with it and tell them I did in fact get my period. I could tell me now being a \"real women\" made my step mom really uncomfortable. Now this is the part where may be the asshole. I started purposely disposing the rolled toilet paper in different trashcans around the house. I could tell it made everyone except my dad uncomfortable. Well my step mom finally realized it wasn't actually a tampon and comforted me about it. Well I came clean and said that was how I was dealing with my bloody noses. My step mom then blew up at me and yelled and screamed at me cause that was such a horrible thing to lie about and how I made her baby boys uncomfortable for no good reason. She then kicked me out, but behind her back my dad decided instead of arguing with her about me staying in his house he was just going to buy me an apartment. My dad has been helping me with rent here and there because I can only work part-time because of my school schedule. My step mom had no idea this is happening and me and my dad have no plans on telling her. After I moved out my step mom's family has been texting saying I'm inconsiderate asshole and I should care more about other people's feelings. This got me thinking that maybe I am the asshole.

However, I am more concerned about your nose bleeds. Have you been tested for anemia? I had undiagnosed anemia and I didn't realize it until I started to get frequent nose bleeds. It was so bad, I needed transfusions.", "NTA.\n\nIt was a practical joke. There was no real harm done. For all intents and purposes, it was a gag.\n\nAnd, taking you at your word, it sounds like it was a well-deserved prank on some horrible people.\n\nBesides, I've seen folks use *actual tampons* for nose bleeds and other minor scrapes and stuff. My \\[male\\] high school general sports coach kept feminine hygiene products in the locker room for such occasions. Those boys are in for a rude awakening if they think just the *idea* of a tampon with blood on it is \"icky.\"\n\nStep-mom has an absurd view of the world to consider you \"not a real woman\" since you don't get your period. She's going to be menopausal in the not-too-distant future and if you *don't* mock her for then not being a real woman, well... then you're a bigger person than I am.\n\n**Edit:** I feel the need to clarify I *do not* subscribe to the idea that a person's womanhood revolves around whether or not they have a period; I just think this person, in particular, deserves a taste of the medicine they've been dishing out.", "NTA.\n\nThis is honestly hysterical and well done you!", "NTA. Your stepmom is making her sons afraid of periods and that\u2019s not good for their future girlfriends and wives (if they are straight).", "If your nose bleeds are frequent, you should be seen by the doctor. There are many issues which could cause bleeding disorders.  Definitely NTA for what you did. What kind of men is your stepmother raising if they are so terrified of a little bit of period blood?", "NTA. Your stepmom sounds like a total delight \ud83d\ude48 I would also recommend consulting your doctor about the frequent nosebleeds. One thing that may help is tranexamic acid, it\u2019s literally stops heavy bleeding and is used to treat frequent nosebleeds! Good luck op!", "NTA.\n\nIt's not your fault blood makes her uncomfortable. No matter if it's a tampon, pad, tissue, whatever. As someone who was raised by the evil stop mom from hell, I understand what you're going through. At least you're out of there and can have some peace now. I wish you the best.", "NTA. Your lie and prank were not a big deal and actually funny unlike most pranks, your step mom is a massive AH, your dad is cool.", "NTA lol.", "NTA", "NTA. You made a harmless joke.

Her sons are gonna treat their wives and gfs like shit when they get their periods! \n\nMy step family is the same way. My dad would keep the peace with my step mom at any cost. I know how much that hurts!\n\nIt sucks that your dad stood by as she kicked you out but at least now you have your own space. You are definitely NTA for any of this! \n\nIm more concerned that maybe you should see a doctor about your frequent nose bleeds, though!\n\nEdit: had to come back and say we sont have to worry about wives or gfs. Theres no way this woman will let any other woman around her \"precious babies\"! Or some poor woman someday will post all over r/justnomil !", "NTA. It's a harmless joke.
