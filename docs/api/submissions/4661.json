(Her only grandchild)", "selftext": "My daughter turns 5 on Friday, my mom tells me today that there's a retirement party she's going to on Friday and asks what our plans are for the b-day. I'm immediately annoyed by just being asked this because every year on my daughter's birthday we have had my parents over, clearly they're going to be involved and with it being a Friday too, kind of a no brainier I'm going to be asking them over. Generally in my family things like birthday plans are last minute 'come on over' type of thing so the obvious answer my mom knows is that there are no exact \"plans\" of what time we are doing things but that we will be asking them to come over at some point when I'm out of work.\n\nI guess my expectation was that on the birthday of her ONLY grandchild her calendar would be clear and I wouldn't be competing with any other social events. After asking more questions she tells me it's for her BIL, my uncle and the husband of the sister she hangs out with the most. Idk why I'm just being told this now as I feel like retirement parties are planned pretty well in advance and my mom claims she didn't forget my daughter's birthday either..\n\nMom (59) and I (30m) exchange a few texts and I throw some shade in my texts and she tells me I'm being unkind because she didn't think it would be a problem to attend both my daughters birthday and my uncle's retirement party. As she was \"just asking what the plan was\" so that she could do both. I guess I find the idea that she needs to do both pretty selfish and unreasonable. I understand an adult retirement party is probably more fun as an adult to attend than a kids birthday but my daughter thinks the world of her grandmother and loves her dearly.\n\nMy mom tells me I'm trying to start a fight and am being unkind for guilting her over this. I think my mom is being immature and selfish for expecting me to be understanding of her dilemma in having two sets of plans on a birthday for again her ONLY grandchild who is turning 5.

How long can you celebrate the birthday of a 5-year-old?!  Unless you're having a 12-hour birthday party for your daughter, it's not unreasonable that your mom could squeeze in both events.\n\nYou're acting awfully entitled toward your (only) mother.  She has a social life, she's entitled to one outside her grandparent status, and sometimes events conflict.

I'm immediately annoyed by just being asked this because every year on my daughter's birthday we have had my parents over, clearly they're going to be involved and with it being a Friday too, kind of a no brainier I'm going to be asking them over. Generally in my family things like birthday plans are last minute 'come on over' type of thing so the obvious answer my mom knows is that there are no exact \"plans\" of what time we are doing things but that we will be asking them to come over at some point when I'm out of work.\n\nI guess my expectation was that on the birthday of her ONLY grandchild her calendar would be clear and I wouldn't be competing with any other social events. After asking more questions she tells me it's for her BIL, my uncle and the husband of the sister she hangs out with the most. Idk why I'm just being told this now as I feel like retirement parties are planned pretty well in advance and my mom claims she didn't forget my daughter's birthday either..\n\nMom (59) and I (30m) exchange a few texts and I throw some shade in my texts and she tells me I'm being unkind because she didn't think it would be a problem to attend both my daughters birthday and my uncle's retirement party. As she was \"just asking what the plan was\" so that she could do both. I guess I find the idea that she needs to do both pretty selfish and unreasonable. I understand an adult retirement party is probably more fun as an adult to attend than a kids birthday but my daughter thinks the world of her grandmother and loves her dearly.\n\nMy mom tells me I'm trying to start a fight and am being unkind for guilting her over this. I think my mom is being immature and selfish for expecting me to be understanding of her dilemma in having two sets of plans on a birthday for again her ONLY grandchild who is turning 5.
