(Her only grandchild)", "selftext": "My daughter turns 5 on Friday, my mom tells me today that there's a retirement party she's going to on Friday and asks what our plans are for the b-day. I'm immediately annoyed by just being asked this because every year on my daughter's birthday we have had my parents over, clearly they're going to be involved and with it being a Friday too, kind of a no brainier I'm going to be asking them over. Generally in my family things like birthday plans are last minute 'come on over' type of thing so the obvious answer my mom knows is that there are no exact \"plans\" of what time we are doing things but that we will be asking them to come over at some point when I'm out of work.\n\nI guess my expectation was that on the birthday of her ONLY grandchild her calendar would be clear and I wouldn't be competing with any other social events. After asking more questions she tells me it's for her BIL, my uncle and the husband of the sister she hangs out with the most. Idk why I'm just being told this now as I feel like retirement parties are planned pretty well in advance and my mom claims she didn't forget my daughter's birthday either..\n\nMom (59) and I (30m) exchange a few texts and I throw some shade in my texts and she tells me I'm being unkind because she didn't think it would be a problem to attend both my daughters birthday and my uncle's retirement party. As she was \"just asking what the plan was\" so that she could do both. I guess I find the idea that she needs to do both pretty selfish and unreasonable. I understand an adult retirement party is probably more fun as an adult to attend than a kids birthday but my daughter thinks the world of her grandmother and loves her dearly.\n\nMy mom tells me I'm trying to start a fight and am being unkind for guilting her over this. I think my mom is being immature and selfish for expecting me to be understanding of her dilemma in having two sets of plans on a birthday for again her ONLY grandchild who is turning 5. AITA?\n\n*Update* I will say the way I wrote this probably made me sound like a much bigger asshole than I am  being. I did text my mom back specifying verbatim that perhaps I was being an asshole and we will work around the birthday time. I will say that my mom and I have had a rocky history which can make communication between us difficult. Seems like I'm being an asshole here I guess, really expected the scenario to be too boring to get many responses from ppl so thanks for the feedback.", "created_utc": 1670973995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlal3y/aita_for_giving_my_mom_a_hard_time_for_having/", "score": 914, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How long can you celebrate the birthday of a 5-year-old?!  Unless you're having a 12-hour birthday party for your daughter, it's not unreasonable that your mom could squeeze in both events.\n\nYou're acting awfully entitled toward your (only) mother.  She has a social life, she's entitled to one outside her grandparent status, and sometimes events conflict.

Your mom has a life outside of you and your child, and she deserves to be present for the other meaningful relationships in her life.

I'm immediately annoyed by just being asked this because every year on my daughter's birthday we have had my parents over, clearly they're going to be involved and with it being a Friday too, kind of a no brainier I'm going to be asking them over. Generally in my family things like birthday plans are last minute 'come on over' type of thing so the obvious answer my mom knows is that there are no exact \"plans\" of what time we are doing things but that we will be asking them to come over at some point when I'm out of work.\n\nI guess my expectation was that on the birthday of her ONLY grandchild her calendar would be clear and I wouldn't be competing with any other social events. After asking more questions she tells me it's for her BIL, my uncle and the husband of the sister she hangs out with the most. Idk why I'm just being told this now as I feel like retirement parties are planned pretty well in advance and my mom claims she didn't forget my daughter's birthday either..\n\nMom (59) and I (30m) exchange a few texts and I throw some shade in my texts and she tells me I'm being unkind because she didn't think it would be a problem to attend both my daughters birthday and my uncle's retirement party. As she was \"just asking what the plan was\" so that she could do both. I guess I find the idea that she needs to do both pretty selfish and unreasonable. I understand an adult retirement party is probably more fun as an adult to attend than a kids birthday but my daughter thinks the world of her grandmother and loves her dearly.\n\nMy mom tells me I'm trying to start a fight and am being unkind for guilting her over this. I think my mom is being immature and selfish for expecting me to be understanding of her dilemma in having two sets of plans on a birthday for again her ONLY grandchild who is turning 5.

My son turns 3 in January and is the only grandchild for 3 out of his 4 sets of grandparents as well. We live 5 hours away from everyone, so we are going to plan something to celebrate his birthday based on everyone's schedules. \n\nYou being mad at your mom for her wanting to attend her BIL's retirement party seems ridiculous. Of course she should be able to do both. She's asking for plans so that she can make sure she doesn't miss anything important. You owe her an apology.", "_\"I guess I find the idea that she needs to do both pretty selfish.\"_\n\nOP seems to think their mom should just sit around, waiting to jump the moment she is summoned.", "I stopped reading when OP said that they expected the mom to clear her calendar, even though absolutely zero plans had been made.\n\nThis kid's bday is in December - aka the busiest month of the year. It is also a Friday. For all the mom knew, OP may have made their last minute plans for Saturday or Sunday. If I were her, I wouldn't plan my life - let alone my December - around someome who just expects me to drop everything to accomodate whatever plan they come up with.", "Thanks for the thoughtful and considerate feedback, you are more right than you know. I did expect my mom to be a different person to my daughter than she was to me.", "He.", "I don't think my grandparents attended a single birthday party of mine growing up and my parents only attended the birthday party of one of my children mostly because I never lived anywhere near my parents when I had kids. I don't know why that is such a big deal. Where I live people have full on adult parties in conjunction with their child's birthday which is just bizarre to me because nobody needs to be over at your house drinking and having a wild time for your child's first birthday or even third birthday. Have a kids party and invite children!", "Damn I missed that subtle nuance in the original post. Thanks for highlighting that very important and relevant detail for us all. ONLY Grandchild.", "_\"I guess my expectation was that on the birthday of her ONLY grandchild her calendar would be clear and I wouldn't be competing with any other social events.\"_\n\nOP is entitled and delusional. Their kid's bday is Dec 16 aka the height of Christmas party/event season. It is also a Friday, so logic would say perhaps the celebration may be on the weekend. OP is winging it but thinks it's a \"no brainer\" that others just turn down invites.", "Yeah I remember turning 5. It no bigger deal than turning 4 or eventually turning 6. I was happy and excited yes but there was no big \"wholly shit! My age fits on one hand!\" moment. I was in preschool but the naming system was k3, K4, and k5 with k5 being the actual kindergarten and preschool and elementary school where all in the same building. No big jump from preschool building or ward to the official grades. It was just the classroom down the hall. Still saw the preschool teachers just with their new students. Also there definitely was no different playground between the little kids or big kids. Everyone played on the same metal playground equipment no matter your age. Ah the 90s and the lack of soft playgrounds like the ones found today.", "\"She\" in their comment is OP's mom, not OP.", "And every year I told her the plan 30 mins prior. Now she wants the birthday plan details earlier to attend another party? She must be soooo selfish right, OP. (Its sarcasm dumbass, don't think I'm supporting you)", "Well, we won't know when it's going to be yet, as it'll be a day-of invite.", "YTA. Plus brother's retirement > granddaughter's 5th birthday. Fewer kids. Unless you didn't invite anyone because you're assuming their just going to show up.", "YTA", "YTA. \nYour mom reached out because she probably wants to go to both and was asking for time frames. You last minute do everything? Then she is supposed to drop everything and come over. She needs to have the whole day free and wait on your beck and call? No. You\u2019re inconsiderate AF. Get it together. Plan the party with real time frames. Such an AH.", "You mom has a life that doesn't revolve around you and your daughter.  At 5 your daughter probably wouldn't notice if you slipped her birthday by a day or two.   Once my kids were school age I moved all birthday parties to weekends or school holidays, because trying to do them on school days was overload for the kids.\n\nChill out.", "YTA. You are being very controlling, bossy and obnoxious", "> I find the idea that she needs to do both pretty selfish and unreasonable.\n\nI find the idea that you find her idea selfish and unreasonable selfish and unreasonable!!! YTA!", "YTA. You sound five years old. Not your daughter.", "YTA. I can\u2019t see how you can\u2019t see it.", "YTA. I find you expecting your mom to solely only spend a FULL DAY for your daughters birthday is \u201cpretty selfish and unreasonable.\u201d Your mom is finding a way to enjoy both activities. She\u2019s planning on being there to celebrate your daughter. \n\nGet over yourself.", "YTA. She was actually really considerate of you. You didn\u2019t send an invitation to anything but she asked to make sure. Don\u2019t expect people to sit around waiting because there is a possibility you might invite them somewhere. Learn from this and ask people.", "But it\u2019s her ONLY grandchild!! \ud83d\ude44", "YTA. But I think the above comment is wrong and it is a big deal. Retirement ceremonies usually take quite a bit of time to plan. Usually at least months because people start planning when they find out when they\u2019ll officially retire. And THIS IS YOUR UNCLES RETIREMENT CEREMONY. are you saying you had no knowledge or invite? And if you did get an invite, you didn\u2019t recognize that it was on your daughters birthday?? \n\nIf you knew then you should have planned ahead. It is a big deal if you knew any details of when your uncle was retiring, didn\u2019t give your mother any heads up until she finally had to reach out three days prior, and then you tried to guilt her over wanting to be supportive for her brother. \n\nYour kid is 5! If you celebrate the day after their birthday, they\u2019ll not know or are capable of waiting a day to celebrate. I find it unlikely that if you hadn\u2019t told your mother when the celebration will be that you told your child. \n\nYTA x100000 grow up.", "My husbands family do this crap and i hate it. Like you know for a whole year a birthday is going to happen, plan something and give us a heads up. At least 24 hours man", "And that somehow he is not the selfish one", "Who is presumably her Mom's brother.", "OP really said \u201cI am not an AH I just talk and act like one\u201d", "His* mother's brother", "It\u2019s to the point of funny that OP\u2019s mom is supposed to prioritize a birthday party that doesn\u2019t even exist yet!", "Especially since the kid is old enough now that they can have actual kid-based birthday plans with  their friends vs a family supper on their birthday (party, sleepover)", "My in-laws have the entire extended family over for kids birthdays and it\u2019s always so over the top. And they do what OP did, expect everyone to be free because it\u2019s one of the kids birthdays but not text solid plans/times until the day before the birthday. This past year I had a friend visiting from across the country and missed a kids birthday. It was the end of the freaking world \u2026 even though I\u2019d had the plans with my friend for half the year and the birthday plans were texted to me the night before.", "Do you really need an invite to clear your day for your only grandchild's birthday tho? smh.", "# SAY YOURE SORRY", "This.  YTA.  Your mom has an entire life that doesn't revolve around that one time you had sex.", "Yes. OP wants his mother to reserve the whole day and sit around waiting for him to call, so that he doesn\u2019t have to plan. Such an AH to think he owns her time like that, no matter how much she loves her granddaughter.\n\nPick a time, OP.", "Not enough times. /s", "Good grief.  I guess I just don't understand that mentality because I grew up in the military myself so we never lived near family members and I was married to a soldier so we still never live near family members so to have to appease extended family because my kids having a birthday is weird to me"]}
