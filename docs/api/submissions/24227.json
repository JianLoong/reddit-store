Nick for the reasons that have already been mentioned, and you because not all C cups are the same size. A 34C is not equal volume to a 36C or a 38C, for example. A 34C would be equivalent in volume to a 36B or a 32D. The way you are framing this is as if you took 38C breasts and stuck them on a woman with a 30 band size--yes, they'd look much bigger on her than on the woman with the 38 band size, but they wouldn't be a C cup \\*on her\\*. A 30C is much less volume than a 38C. Neither woman probably looks especially busty. \n\nA lot of women wear too large a band size and too small a cup size, anyhow, so what we think of as a D cup or whatever is all skewed, and a lot of women who wear a 36D should probably be something more like a 32F, but good luck finding that size. \n\nBut you're wrong about a topic that's personally relevant to you, that you are trying to apply correctly, and that's hard to learn about.

Cup size is always in relation to the band size. So something like a \"C cup\" does not exist.\n\n42 A = 40 B = 38 C = 36 D\n\nSo if your band is too tight and you want it looser but the cup size is good you have to go one band size up and one cup down to have THE SAME cup size. It also goes the other way around.", "It's so funny lol", "I AM a C cup and consider it small.", "Having a wife with a \"difficult\" bra size has taught me a lot about bra sizes and the quality or lack of it of ingery shop fitting services.

I have measured at home, been measure by dozens of bra stores that sold $25 bras to $500 bras. I have always been a 34B. \n\nOne time I walked into a Victoria secrets and the sales attendant told me \u201choney you\u2019re a 32 DDD, you\u2019ve been wearing the wrong bra\u201d. No, honey, I have not. There is no part of my boobs that are a DDD and I\u2019m not a 32 band size.

Aus and UK use the same system for dress sizing which is generally 2 numbers higher than US equivalents (I.e. aus size 6 dress is a US size 2 dress).\n\nBut then the UK uses inches for band sizes just like the US does but for some reason Aus and NZ went rogue and invented our own system that sort of loosely corresponds to dress sizing but not really.", "No it correlated with dress size (broadly) so a 32inch is equivalent to a size 10.
