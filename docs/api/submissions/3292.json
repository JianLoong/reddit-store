Mom was remarried 14 months later. It was fast, she was not cheating, she just moved quickly. It wasn't great for me but my siblings love stepdad and a year after he married our mom they wanted to be adopted. I did not. They gave it another couple of years before bringing it forward anyway. A judge decided to speak to me and send me to a therapist. In the end the judge declared he could not adopt me but could adopt my siblings. Seems he normally approved adoption regardless but he realized that I didn't secretly want it but felt guilty. Mom said she would not let me be left out of that. But I never wanted it.\n\nThe topic comes up a lot and it upsets my siblings that they can't be adopted because I say no. They love him and call him dad and want him to be their full dad. Whereas I never saw him as my dad and truthfully, I don't love him. I appreciate him for stepping up and being here. But he will never be as important to me as he is to them or as my dad and mom were (mom and I have a shaky relationship now because of this stuff). \n\nMy siblings sat me down a few days ago and said we needed to talk. That they wanted to be adopted. I told them to talk to mom then. They said mom will never let me be left behind. They told me how it would be for them if I said yes to being adopted, that my stepdad is a good man and it would be good for me and for him because it would show him that I love him (they don't know that I don't feel that way). I said I would never let another man adopt me and I only have one dad and I would not change that for them. They said that means they can never be adopted. I told them adult adoption is a thing if they want it but the answer from me is never. They started to get upset and my sister cried. My brother was frustrated.\n\nMy mom and stepdad told me I was being unfair by not trying more for their (my siblings) sakes.

Standing your ground is enough.\n\nSpeaking of which...\n\nI don't know where you are, but I'll tell you about my personal experience here in Texas. I was adopted as an infant. At my adoption, I was issued a new birth certificate that listed my adoptive parents' names as if they were my biological parents. There were no markings on the birth certificate to show that it had been amended.  My original birth certificate was sealed away by the state. If I went to the vital statistics office to get a copy of my birth certificate if I needed it to get a driver's license, passport, etc, I would pay the fee and get handed a copy of the birth certificate with my adoptive parents' names on it. It would have taken a court order after I turned 18 to get a copy of my original birth certificate. I tried that. The judge said no because he didn't want to be the first to say yes in that part of the state.  He was also very confused that my adoptive mother was sitting next to me saying she agreed with me. Oh well. That was around 1989.\n\n I have lobbyd at the state capital In Austin many times for bills that would have given adult adopties access to the dare original birth certificates. It doesn't go anywhere  But I don't have time right now to write a dissertation about why.\n\nWhen I was in my late 30s, a  bill was finally passed that would let me have a copy of my original birth certificate on regular copy paper. I  Went to pick this up at the very state agency that I work for at that time period they made me sit in a special little section of the lobby.  A woman who handles all of these kinds of requests came from the back office to talk to me. She asked me if I understood what this was and pointed to the piece of paper. I told her yes. I had to verify that I knew at least one of the names on there besides mine. That means I had to have already searched and successfully found part of my birth family without help from the state before they would give me that piece of paper.  I had done that so she handed me the piece of paper. She walked off and I just sat there and stared at it. It was a good thing I was setting down. The whole line that should have information about my biological father was left blank. I found out a short while later that because my birth mother was not married when I was born in 1969, the state didn't think she could possibly know who my father was and so they would not put my biological father's name on the birth certificate.  It's too long of a story for now, but I wanted his name on the birth certificate more than I wanted hers. The State of Texas stole my birth father from me.  Going back over to my office was a little bit difficult that day. I knew adoptees faced a lot of challenges at times but I just had not expected that one.\n\nFast forward to 2013. My husband and I were kinship Foster parents to 7 of our grandchildren. CPS had decided they wanted to terminate their parents rights.We could not afford our own lawyer so I had to stand up in open court to talk to the judge. He asked me if we would adopt these children. I asked him if they were going to change the birth certificates and seal the records for my grandchildren and he said yes. I told him that we were trying to teach the kids about grace and I did not want to take an action that would makes the kids feel that the beginning of their lives were so horrible that it had to be erased.  I had to acknowledge that we would not get any of the usual adoption benefits from the state. The judge thought I was a little bit crazy but they gave us permanent managing conservatorship. This kept all of the story of my grandchildren's birth intact.  There are quite a few reasons that I might regret the decision I made not to terminate their parents rights but when it comes back to knowing I did right by letting them keep their identities I feel very good about it. If they had been in the kinds of danger where we had needed to change their identities and possibly our own to protect them I would have done that period but that simply was not the case.\n\nI know people who have been adopted and people who want to be adopted that feel differently about this issue than I do.  I don't tell you my story to convince you to be adopted by your stepfather or not be adopted. I really do think you've already made that decision and I support it.  I simply wanted to point out that this is not a decision that can be made for any type of sentimental reasons. I think that what your mother is doing is a type of emotional blackmail. It's possible that your stepfather is in on it as well. But I think you need to stand your ground. You said that you know who you are and record should always reflect that.  Please feel free to contact me privately if you need any information or support.\n\nI'm sorry if this has been messy.

Even if you don't really believe this you have to show her how her actions could drive you there (worst case scenario). \"Mom, if you keep up with this bullshit you will end up getting exactly what you want, all your kids will agree to be adopted by your husband because you will only have 2 kids.\" NTA", "NTA. Your mom sure as heck is, though. Have you sat her down and told her that you're refusing to be adopted *because* it's so important,  and you don't feel comfortable having another dad? \nYour mom is seriously being a jerk here. She should let your siblings be adopted. This is not your fault.", "NTA. This needs to stop. There are so many similar stories out there. If a child isn't a baby, and the other parent is alive,  then frankly adoption by a step parent shouldn't be permissible.", "NTA, this is entirely on your mum and step-dad, don't accept any judgement or criticism from them, and make sure they realise that it isn't personal, so they need to stop making it so", "NTA\n\nYour mother and her husband are being petty. In what way are you \"left behind\"? Why can't he adopt those two if that's what they want? And in a couple years it legally won't make a whole lot of difference anyway. It sounds more like he's hurt that you don't feel that way about him, and he's using your siblings as leverage, which is unacceptable behavior.", "What's with the all or nothing ultimatum?  NTA, but wtf  is your mom thinking? Weaponzing your siblings against you, that's bananas.", "NTA. I\u2019ve commented a couple of times already to other peoples comments so won\u2019t go into detail.\n\nPlease show this post to your mum and step siblings, perhaps in a family therapy session if you can. It\u2019s hard to gauge whether your mum will be swayed given her determination for over 8 years, but your siblings may recognise your perspective of this situation and it will likely finally show them that you\u2019re not still \u2018uncertain\u2019, that this is genuinely how you feel. Fingers crossed, it could be the trigger that finally breaks their anger at you. And, maybe maybe maybe, enables their adoption to their dad (your stepdad).\n\nAnd, update us when you do. \u2764\ufe0f", "What is this about being \"left behind\"? You obviously don't feel excluded. In fact, you are being explicit at your desire TO BE excluded on this. Your mom has the issue here, not you. And it's quite shitty of her to foist that off on you, ruining your relationship with your siblings. NTA", "NTA, what kind of mind game is your mom trying to play? She\u2019s going to end up with no relationship with you in a couple of years anyway, so she can get this idea of the perfect family out of her head now.", "It\u2019s tricky, because if for a long term, your mum was constantly reinforcing that she was confident you did love him and would change your mind eventually, he may have felt that you would change your mind if he waited out long enough. But, the fact that even he has moved past it is telling that you have been clear. Your mum simply refuses to let go of a dream that isn\u2019t feasible. She needs to realise that the only person impeding your relationship with your siblings is her."]}
