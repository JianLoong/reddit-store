Mom was remarried 14 months later. It was fast, she was not cheating, she just moved quickly. It wasn't great for me but my siblings love stepdad and a year after he married our mom they wanted to be adopted. I did not. They gave it another couple of years before bringing it forward anyway. A judge decided to speak to me and send me to a therapist. In the end the judge declared he could not adopt me but could adopt my siblings. Seems he normally approved adoption regardless but he realized that I didn't secretly want it but felt guilty. Mom said she would not let me be left out of that. But I never wanted it.\n\nThe topic comes up a lot and it upsets my siblings that they can't be adopted because I say no. They love him and call him dad and want him to be their full dad. Whereas I never saw him as my dad and truthfully, I don't love him. I appreciate him for stepping up and being here. But he will never be as important to me as he is to them or as my dad and mom were (mom and I have a shaky relationship now because of this stuff). \n\nMy siblings sat me down a few days ago and said we needed to talk. That they wanted to be adopted. I told them to talk to mom then. They said mom will never let me be left behind. They told me how it would be for them if I said yes to being adopted, that my stepdad is a good man and it would be good for me and for him because it would show him that I love him (they don't know that I don't feel that way). I said I would never let another man adopt me and I only have one dad and I would not change that for them. They said that means they can never be adopted. I told them adult adoption is a thing if they want it but the answer from me is never. They started to get upset and my sister cried. My brother was frustrated.\n\nMy mom and stepdad told me I was being unfair by not trying more for their (my siblings) sakes.
