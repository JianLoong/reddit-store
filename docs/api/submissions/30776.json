It's understandable to feel that everyone should be paying their fair share, especially if you've all agreed to split the expenses evenly. However, the dynamics can get tricky when dealing with a couple within a group of friends.\r  \n\r  \nThere's a reasonable perspective on both sides of this situation. For married couples, combining finances is a common practice, and they often consider themselves a singular financial entity, leading to them splitting costs as a unit. This approach is generally accepted within their arrangement, but it might not be universally understood by all members of the group.\r  \n\r  \nFrom your point of view, the split should be evenly distributed per person, considering each individual's share in the incurred cost. This view aligns with the notion that everyone should contribute an equal share. It might feel disrespectful or unfair to have one entity pay less while benefiting from the same shared expenses.\r  \n\r  \nThe resolution here could come from a deeper conversation. Communicating your perspective openly and discussing the basis on which you would like expenses divided could be beneficial. Finding a mutual understanding might help in maintaining the friendship without the financial unease that's arisen.\r  \n\r  \nWhile it's crucial to express your concerns, it's also vital to understand that relationships, especially between couples, have different dynamics. The goal is to strike a balance between respecting each other's perspective and finding a common ground to move forward without causing rifts in the friendship.", "NTA\n\nAdvice:  Find different friends.", "NTA\n\nThey're being cheap.

If you're getting an air bnb, I think the same principle applies-- if them not being a couple would have meant you guys needed a more expensive airBnB because you needed one with more sleeping space, then your accommodation split should keep that in mind. AirBnBs aren't as simple splitting as hotel rooms-- but at the base I would say when you guys are getting an AirBnb and spending all your days out and just using it to eat and sleep, it should be treated closer to hotel rooms, and when you're talking getting a whole ass private cottage for a group and all your vacation is taken in the Airbnb with its amenities, the closer the split should be to per-person.\n\nCost of parking, cost of food, ect, should absolutely be split on a per-person basis tho.", "NTA in the parking example.

That\u2019s why all this even split stuff is nonsense. These parties need to have some internal sensible agreement and stick with it without bitterness. OP didn\u2019t mention any specifics. Is the vacation about the house in question, such as a beach condo, or is the house just base camp for other things? I admittedly assumed the latter because it\u2019s personally alien to me to go on vacation somewhere where the lodging is the entire point, albeit I acknowledge that this exists. OP didn\u2019t address things like a bigger nicer bathroom or bigger bed or whatever for the couple, just \u201crooms.\u201d If it\u2019s just rooms, split by room.

You don\u2019t know for sure how much of the common spaces people will occupy until you actually go on the trip. The bedrooms are a constant because you know that people will need a place to sleep, change and store their things.", "That\u2019s a weird example, If the chair isn\u2019t perfectly positioned in front of the tv you can just move it. As long as you put it back, it\u2019s not a problem.", "My reasoning is that per person is going to cause just as many (or even more) problems because of all the variables. \n\nLet\u2019s say that I and my spouse and two friends, one single and one with their SO, took a weeklong trip to the beach or something. Three rooms, a pool, a living room, a porch. Let\u2019s say we split the cost by rooms, evenly. Whoever wants the best room should pay a little more. Someone here suggested like 40/30/30 on such an arrangement. \n\nSo one room is a master with a whirlpool tub and attached shower, one is a guest room with an attached full bath with tub/shower combo, one is a standard room that shares its bathroom with the common area of the unit. The master costs 40%, seems fair. The other members of the group \u2014 one couple, one single \u2014 now get the other rooms. The couple wants the bedroom with the attached bathroom. The single guy asks why he\u2019s got to pay the same for a room that shares a bathroom with the common area. Etc. \n\nI say all this to demonstrate acknowledgment of better rooms being worth more \u2014 and thus costing more \u2014 than lesser rooms. This is an aspect I\u2019d not considered. It will still cause some issues, but it\u2019s probably easier to grade it fairly based on room quality, not room occupancy. Should two people in a room pay the same price per person as someone else in a room by themselves? That\u2019s not fair! That person gets a WHOLE ROOM to themself! And so on. \n\nBut beyond that, I start to question the idea of even splits on common areas, to the point where I think it would be easiest to not even address them. That is, base the pricing \u2014 however you want to do it \u2014 on the rooms, nothing else. \n\nIf in my scenario let\u2019s say everyone had to kick in an equal amount of money for the common area, whatever its designated price. I assume that\u2019s kitchen, TV room, deck/patio, pool if there is one, etc. Now, let\u2019s say Couple A is gone all day long, out adventuring, taking meals at cafes and restaurants, and using the home to shower and sleep. Let\u2019s say Couple B isn\u2019t as adventurous and mostly stays out on the deck, swimming and sunbathing, and that they use the kitchen to cook most meals. Let\u2019s say Person C is there to hang with their friends but isn\u2019t the outgoing type and stays inside the whole time, sitting on the couch, watching TV, eating snacks, etc.  Why should Couple A kick in exactly as much per person as the others? What happens when Person C decides they\u2019re going to go out on the back deck bear the pool and chain smoke while Couple B is using the pool and is thus having the quality of their experience reduced by this smoking? \n\nNow me personally, I travel light and use lodgings for sleeping and bathing and using the bathroom. That\u2019s pretty much it. I\u2019ve never been in nor would I be in a situation like the above. But I can guarantee these kinds of issues are real, and there\u2019s likely to be a lot more protesting about the equity of even splits of common areas based on bodycount than about parsing it all out by the bedrooms without worrying about how many people are in each one. \n\nThe exception to that would be if the living situation is so cramped \u2014 16 people sharing a 3 or 4 bedroom condo or something, that there\u2019s no expectation of luxury beyond sleep/bathroom access. In those cases, no matter the rooms, go by person. But then what about the people who get the beds vs the people who get the couch vs the people who get the floor?  \n\nEtc.", "Maybe so.

And...the husbands used MY bathroom to hang up their smelly fishing clothes to dry off in because my cousin said they looked tacky hanging over the balcony. And since this bath was the most convenient to the living area everyone used it when we were hanging out and someone kept peeing on the toilet seat. \n\nWhen my bestie and I go away together we get a house with two bedrooms and two baths because while we love being together, we also like our own spaces to which to retreat.

Lodging gets a little more complicated as they are only taking one room. If anything, the person who takes the master bedroom with the en-suite should be paying more. All regular rooms should split evenly", "I would sleep on the couch and make them pay for the whole thing.", "NTA. For things like parking?  Clearly split by person.  AirBNB - it kinda depends, but imagining you are getting equal rooms with equal ammenties, they should still pay more because, while they are sharing a bed, they use more of the common spaces than a single person", "I\u2019m a part of a 6 person travel group.  1 couple and 4 singles.  We split the cost 6 ways!  Each trip we rotate the order of room selection. The couple never shares a room with the rest of us, but the are subject to get the room with the bunk bed or twins. \n\nIt works for us!", "NTA. We always split the costs per person. It just makes sense.", "Info: Whose car was it, who drove, who paid for the gas etc?", "Just get your own hotel next time and refuse to split any AirBNB's. Hotels are ideal for single people anyway. \n\nCouples love saving money by exploiting their single friends into splitting AirBnB's.", "Disagree. A third person changed the usage of the bathroom, time occupied in there, bodies in the room, luggage in the room makes it harder to move and do stuff. I've stayed in hotel rooms with two people and also three and there's a noticeable difference. Everyone is benefiting from sharing so I think everyone should pay.", "This if they\u2019re not taking up anymore resource than 1 person would then I\u2019m fine with them counting as one person. But when it comes to car rentals, gas, groceries, etc, they will be counted as individuals", "Why per person?  That only makes sense if the couple would have driven separately (which they would not have). They would have brought one car and OP another. Instead there is one car, so split in half.", "I disagree. They will also be sharing the common areas, even more so if the couple gets the master bedroom with a master bath", "Well, they use 2 people's worth of food, utilities, and space. They generally get a bigger and better room and they make more money than a single person. \n\nThe parking is iffy because it costs the same to park no matter how many people are in the car. But, then again, if three people are using the car, 3 people should pay. That's where you negotiate before the trip so these things don't come up later.", "Nah. 50/50 isn\u2019t \u201cobvious\u201d. Unless you give single person the master bedroom and they take up twice as much time in the bathroom etc as each of you", "Except what if the shared room is the large double with ensuite?", "If one person is taking up an entire bed are they not taking up both sides of the bed? If one person is taking up an entire couch, are they not using the entire couch? \n\nWeak logic.\n\nOP is the asshole", "Can you explain this another way? I'm not following your point", "Do they use the bathroom? Am I sharing the bathroom with 1 or 2 people? It matters.", "What if 2 bathrooms? Couple takes 1, OP gets 1?", "That was my initial thinking. I\u2019ve since budged a bit on the notion that all rooms in a home rental aren\u2019t created equal, so the better room ought to cost a bit more. A lot of people also talk about paying a per person even split on shared access rooms like the living room and kitchen, but I disagree with that (preferring to simply base everything on bedrooms rather than engage in the murk about shared access facilities).", "Then only 1 of the couple should have access to the shared bathroom, the couch, the kitchen, or the hot tub.", "Fuck no. You split the cost based on the # of people using the amenities. Are there 2 or 3 people staying in the airbnb? 3? Ok then its 33%.", "Sure! For the car parking fee, do they charge per person? If not, they would have charged the same fee whether it was you or several of you.  The fact is, your married friends are an entity and they would not have gone by themselves alone with you. So you as an entity and them as an entity would be two parts, 50/50. If you pay 33% of the parking fee, that would be unfair because there would have been no possible way where you would have gotten an opportunity to pay only 33% of that. However, paying half of gas on a trip is always fair. So make them pay half of the fee & half of your gas so you can recoup as much as possible. For the Airbnb, they usually don't charge double for each additional person. The base is usually the biggest chunk of the per night price. If you pay 33%, again you are being unfair to them \\*unless\\* the nightly fee did go up the same amount for each additional person (so if it started at 20 then 40 then 60 etc). The most fairest thing is to do the math. See exactly the difference between what you would have paid alone & then what it costs with them added. Then make them pay that. All the people who bring up \"they take more showers, use more space\" are using something more of a roommate situation as an example than something short term as an Airbnb. I hope I make some sense and in the end, you are not wrong to ask either way. They can choose to come, or not to come. I just personally like to keep my friends and this can be an easy way to lose friends. Good luck!!!", "If they don\u2019t increase with more people, OP doesn\u2019t get to try and only pay 1/3 if they get 1/2 the Airbnb. You made my point. Thank you.", "Imo it goes by bedroom, but ultimately, it should be discussed and unanimously decided before any commitments are made. If an agreement can't be reached, then best not do it at all.", "In that case, use the online calculators that include proportional use of common areas and bathrooms into the equation.  People try to figure out how to split rent with a variety of roommate situations all the time.  It's not fair to split things as though each person in your hypothetical triad were getting their own bedroom, but it's also ridiculous to expect the single person to pay half when getting only 1/4 usage of common areas/bathroom/kitchen/etc", "My family did an abnb and we ate almost all the meals in the house and cooked and spent a lot of time there. We went to the beach and on walks too but it was just a place to gather from all over the country. We were there to see each other not go out", "What? Of course people do. One of the main reasons I get an airbnb is so that I can make many of my own meals and not have to go our uf I'm tired, regardless if I'm traveling alone or with a friend or with my husband. I travel a lot and my days are usually very active. I'm tired most evenings when I get back to my bnb and often just toss a pizza in the oven and watch something on Netflix. That's doubly true if I'm traveling alone (which I love to do).", "Counter argument for parking is that you and your BF would have driven together regardless, so you only would have brought one car, and your friend another. That being the case, it\u2019s 2 theoretical cars that cause a split in two, instead of 3 people causing a split in three.", "So one of you didn\u2019t use the kitchen, living room, cleaning fee or anything else?", "What about a restaurant?  They are a couple but have two meals. You have one. Obviously it\u2019s 33% each. Not sure why anything else would be different", "Small details that haven\u2019t been mentioned. Also, that sounds very knit picky and I would not go on trips with people like that. Trying to nickel and dime at every thrn", "Seem that the easy solution is to stop paying for overpriced airbnbs for a group of 3", "It\u2019s literally not decided by sides of a bed, it\u2019s by size of the bed. You sounds mentally challenged. I have never in my life seen a 2 bedroom with two twins, so how the F do you expect a two bedroom to sleep 2?", "2 bedrooms are factored at 4 people, 2 per bed. If one person rents it you don\u2019t get a discount lol", "You sound like someone I would not travel with. If I traveled with a couple I\u2019d give them the bigger bed or the on suites so my friends partner doesn\u2019t have to walk in a towel in common areas. You all sound like selfish assholes.", "You actually can book individual rooms on Airbnb, what are you talking about? Water and energy are priced in, a two bedroom won\u2019t charge less for 2 people than 3 people", "If each person gets the same amenities(one bed, one shower) then sure. But if two people are sharing a bed then they don\u2019t pay the same price as the person with their own bed. That\u2019s stupid.", "Take the cleaning fee. \n\nEveryone uses the living room and the kitchen. Why should the couple pay 1/2 the cleaning fee when they use 1/2 the bedrooms and 2/3 the common area. The other person is paying half the cleaning fee but they used 1/2 the bedrooms and 1/3 the common areas.", "You get it. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is an asshole here, but I think people need to think about this in a different fashion.\n\nIf OP hadn\u2019t shared a car and drove himself, he would have had a separate $120 parking fee. Because they shared, why should OP save $80, and they only save $40?\n\nInstead of how much everyone pays, consider how much everyone saves. If you split $120 50/50, OP save s$60 and they save $60. If you split it 66/33, OP saves $80 and they save $40.  Still good for everyone, but why should OP save twice as much?", "And if a friend wants to come use the 3rd bedroom they get to pay $0?", "This, all this should be sorted well before any arrangements are made.", "Agreed, frankly I simply wouldn't travel with someone like OP. Seems too high strung", "And also us single people see all the couples only trips / events that happen and don\u2019t want to rock the boat and get uninvited to the stuff we still get invited to.", "Every pay situation will be different, so while you discuss plans, you should also discuss pay percentage. For instance, if they didn't airbnb it, and they just got hotel rooms, the couple would pay the same amount as the single. So as for accommodations I would say 50/50 split between the 3 of them. Another instance, going to dinner as a 3 party, I would definitely be splitting it 33/33/33.\n\nEvery situation will call for its own pay scale. Just put it out there on the table while plans are being made. Good luck OP.", "Yet the couple has to pay the same amount for a shared bedroom and the single person gets twice the space?  Argument cuts both ways.", "Ya, but that isn't what happened. Everyone was better off with the 1 car, pay your fair share.\n\nYour counter argument is that all 3 pay more.", "None of us did we were there to sleep \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f we only got an Airbnb because hotels were sold out where we were at.  It was very basic accommodations.", "you forgot since 47 is a prime number you need to round that up to 48%, but if the pool is empty and the house comes with a blue bicycle then the cat fee is voided, obviously", "So because they are sharing a bed they pay for nothing? Thats fucking stupid.", "100% on the money.", "I\u2019m talking about the common areas, not the bedrooms. Go 50-50 on the bedrooms.", "That\u2019s literally what happened. A couple that would have taken a car split with an individual that would have taken a car.  Why should OP save 2/3 from what he would have had to pay and the couple only save 1/3, instead of each saving 1/2?\n\nUltimately, the benefit of sharing is a savings of $120, and the single person should not receive 2/3 of the benefit.", "My god I love me a spreadsheet. If you\u2019ve got one I know we\u2019ll travel well together!", "They are occupying half the space and should pay half.", "Can\u2019t believe so few people understand that, even with the above example. Oh well, can\u2019t fix a lack of critical thinking.", "It isn't that deep.\n\nSingle pays $120\n\nCouple pay $120, $60 each\n\n$240 total\n\nOr\n\nAll pay $40 each.\n\n$120 total.\n\nRegardless of what the couple thinks, they are 2 separate people. Each individual is evenly saving.\n\nBy your logic, if a single joins a couple at a 3 bedroom apartment where the couple uses 2 bedrooms, the single should pay 50% and the couple using 2 rooms should pay 50%, see how silly that is?", "Thats not how anything works.", "Your apartment example is stupid as it isn't the same at all (as a couple wouldn't take two of the bedrooms).  A better example would be three people, one couple and a single person, getting a two bedroom hotel instead of a single. \n\nIf a single bedroom hotel costs $500 and a two bedroom $750, it would cost both parties $500 each to get a single bedroom hotel room.  If they combine and get a two bedroom $250 is saved.  If the single person only pays 1/3, they will pay $250 of the $750, and the couple will pay $500.  In that instance, the couple has saved nothing, and the single person has saved $250.  If instead, you go 50/50, the single person saves $125 and the couple saves $125.", "Each is saving, but not evenly, which is my point.  Your own math even shows that if you bother to look.   Sometimes it does take a bit of effort to go deeper.", "If they were getting hotel rooms the couple would pay the same amount as the single person. This is why I don\u2019t travel with cheap people. If you\u2019re going to cry about every dime you aren\u2019t someone I would travel with anyways.", "It isn't stupid, it is the equivalent of the car. The car has 5 equal seats and the couple is using 2 of them while the single is using 1. Didn't read your second paragraph.", "All separately, they pay $120, together, they pay $40. The couple isn't 1 person, they are 2. \n\nAnyway, enjoy paying $120 on your own there smart guy!", "Because the couple would have to pay by seat for parking.  You are denser than osmium.  Glad you didn't read my second paragraph, as I wouldn't want you to hurt yourself.  Good luck tying your shoes tomorrow.", "Smart girl, you said they save evenly, when actually the OP saves $80 individually and the couples saves $20 each.  Simple math.  The couple wouldn't drive separately, so your $120 each math doesn't exist in reality."]}
