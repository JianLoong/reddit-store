It's understandable to feel that everyone should be paying their fair share, especially if you've all agreed to split the expenses evenly. However, the dynamics can get tricky when dealing with a couple within a group of friends.\r  \n\r  \nThere's a reasonable perspective on both sides of this situation. For married couples, combining finances is a common practice, and they often consider themselves a singular financial entity, leading to them splitting costs as a unit. This approach is generally accepted within their arrangement, but it might not be universally understood by all members of the group.\r  \n\r  \nFrom your point of view, the split should be evenly distributed per person, considering each individual's share in the incurred cost. This view aligns with the notion that everyone should contribute an equal share. It might feel disrespectful or unfair to have one entity pay less while benefiting from the same shared expenses.\r  \n\r  \nThe resolution here could come from a deeper conversation. Communicating your perspective openly and discussing the basis on which you would like expenses divided could be beneficial. Finding a mutual understanding might help in maintaining the friendship without the financial unease that's arisen.\r  \n\r  \nWhile it's crucial to express your concerns, it's also vital to understand that relationships, especially between couples, have different dynamics. The goal is to strike a balance between respecting each other's perspective and finding a common ground to move forward without causing rifts in the friendship.", "NTA\n\nAdvice:  Find different friends.", "NTA\n\nThey're being cheap.

Them sharing a room doesn't mean that your room should be cheaper. \n\nBut you all use electricity and water and whatever other communal resources, so it would be fair to pay per person. The consumed \"resource\" is different. \n\nFor a parking fee, the fee would be the same if there were two or three or ten people \\[unless it's a weird fee\\] and so it makes sense to do it per person. They should also already be thinking this way, since they have the potential for two incomes, and they are pricing you out of future activities. \n\nNTA.", "I would say that for the Airbnb, it\u2019s fair to split 50/50 if both parties have one room.

However parking, eating, and other expenses that are per person, should definitely be paid by head", "NTA. I can kind of see them wanting to pay 50% if they are using one room in a rental and you are using the other, but on the other hand, each of them is using a whole person's worth of utilities, so it doesn't quite work out.\n\nFor parking? Screw them. Your way is the only way.", "NTA", "When traveling in groups, I think the following split is fair.   Take the cost of the place and divide it in half.  Each individual pays an equal share.  Then the second half is divided by the number of sleeping quarters.  Then each sleeping unit (however many are in the room) pays equal shares.

It might be fair to discount their share of the living accommodations for sharing a room between them, but did they get a bigger room and a bigger shared bed than you? They should pay at least a token amount more that recognises that factor. \n\nAnd anything else, like food, fuel and parking fees, really does need to recognise that they are two people sharing the amenity with their fellow traveller(s), not a single unit, because it isn't just one person eating and it isn't just one person's weight making the car burn fuel to carry them.", "You're both. I think an Airbnb should be split per household. If you're going to dinner, drinks, whatever, then you should pay for your stuff. I'm not sure on the parking.
