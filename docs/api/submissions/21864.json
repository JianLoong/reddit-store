Me and my husband (29M) and before I start, I realize that you are internet strangers but we want a third opinion and it never hurts trying.\r  \n\r  \nMy husband (let's call him Liam) has blood cancer and it's been diagnosed too late, the doctor told us he's going to live a year and half or so, best guesses, if he gets treated, a few months without it. I'm pregnant, 3 months.\r  \n\r  \n**My perspective:**\r  \n\r  \nLiam is going to die, words are not enough to express the feelings I have right now and God knows that but I keep crying whenever I remember it so I just want to be strong for once and write how I feel. Liam and I always wanted to have a family, that's all that we ever wished for, and when we finally started it, he's going to disappear. It's not his fault, I'm never blaming him but I just want him to witness the birth of his son, just a photo of him and his son together, something to remember him by and something that my son is going to see in the future and something that doesn't make him regret it later.\r  \n\r  \nI just don't want him gone without knowing that his son is finally alive and healthy, I just want to have that moment but he doesn't want to keep getting chemo because he feels terrible, it's just a few months more, I keep telling him to hang on a little bit and he feels so conflicted right now.\r  \n\r  \n**Liam's perspective:**\r  \n\r  \nI never wanted to have chemo but my wife pressured me to do it, I understand how she feels and how my whole extended family feels, they want to see me more, they want to have more memories with me, they want to enjoy life with me a bit longer, but I can't I just can't do it anymore, my head is hairless, I feel so tired that I can't go to the gym like I used to anymore, it just hurts and I feel awful. What's the point of living if I can't enjoy it anymore? Just to see my son? I love my son before he's even born so so much but I don't even know if he's going to like me being miserable in a photo, I want to leave with dignity and I don't want him to see me like this 10 years later. I followed the treatment plan in the beginning for my wife and parents and siblings and all but I don't think I want to continue anymore and now she keeps trying to convince me to do otherwise. \r  \n\r  \nWe want your opinions. What would you do if you were in my place? AITA (the wife) for telling him to keep getting the treatment? AITA (Liam) for wanting to stop?\r  \n\r", "created_utc": 1689015040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w2mlu/aita_for_wanting_my_husband_to_keep_getting_chemo/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NAH, you each have perfectly understandable feelings stemming from an unimaginably hard situation. No one is an asshole for wanting more time with a love one, but in the end the decision has to be made by the dying individual. You make that decision with the advice and thoughts of loved ones, but this is the most personal decision that can be made.", "NAH\n\nBut it's Liam's decision. \n\nOP, not to be harsh, but you're trying to get Liam to go through immense levels of anguish for a photo op. And eventually, if Liam caves to your request, someone is going to tell your son what happened. Imagine growing up with a picture of your dad, likely in obvious pain, and thinking he fought to be there for you. Now imagine that day when someone lets it slip that Liam never wanted to stick around, that he was in immense pain and discomfort, and he put himself through that hell because you, OP, demanded it.\n\nAnd to be crystal clear, you would absolutely be the asshole if this wasn't cancer. With cancer, all bets are off. People make crazy decisions all the time. Allow your husband to die with the dignity he is begging you for. Support him in it. Make his last days, weeks, months, as pleasant as possible. Stop asking for something so superficial. \n\nAnd if you really want a picture of Liam with your son, I'm an artist, so just message me privately, and I will be glad to photo edit the two of them together, or paint a portrait of them free of charge. I know (from all too painful experience) how hard it is to let someone go to cancer-- to come to terms with someone stopping treatment. If there is truly no hope, living a horrible life to squeeze one more day in is no life. Liam has come to this realization, and you have to as well, for Liam's sake.", "Friends, I truly have no words other than to say NAH. I am so sorry. \n\nThat said, I am going to gently suggest that Liam is entitled to do as he wishes. Nothing about this is easy or fair, and I totally and completely understand why Mrs. Liam wants what she wants. \n\nBut this is Liam's body, and it's what's left of his life. One cannot just live for other people. It is valid and right to live for yourself, too.", "NAH.  Given that you can't have what both of you would most prefer, you both want what you want and there is nothing wrong with that.  It is just very sad.  \n\nHowever. Because it's Liam's pain and Liam's life, Liam gets to decide.    Don't try to push him into prolonging his pain, since he has said that's not what he wants.  \n\nMaybe the two of you together can think of some ways to connect Liam and the future child - does he want to make video or audio recordings, choose some of his belongings to be set aside, pose for a picture with his hand on your belly or at the ultrasound appointment, etc.  \n\nOP, you do need some support to grieve not getting to see Liam be a dad the way you wanted.  Liam shouldn't have to be the one to comfort you.  If you don't have some friends/family who can just listen to you (ideally people who are closer to you than to Liam), then you should probably start looking for a counsellor of some kind.", "NAH\n\nThat being said, as someone who watched someone very close to me go through 9 months of chemo, and then pass away. Please don't pressure him to do this. \n\nI completely understand why you want him to make it to that moment at the very least, but I beg you to consider what the next six, and a half months will be like for him if he does. He will be in so much more pain than you can possibly imagine right now. \n\nThis is going to be a nightmare for both of you, no matter what you decide, but if you push him to do this his last few months with you are going to be unbearable for him. \n\nAfter my family member passed the biggest regret that any of us had was that several of my family members pushed her to have chemo instead of letting her do it on her terms. By the end she was already gone. She was not her anymore, and she was begging us to just let her go in her few moments where she was coherent.\n\nPlease don't make him do this. Let him choose to do this on his own terms.", "Liam - you won\u2019t be around for your sons life and it\u2019s heartbreaking. I\u2019m so sorry.  \n\nOne thing you can do is write letters or record videos for him.  You can write a letter for his first day of school, first heartbreak, getting a car, graduation, marriage.  Anything you can think of.  \n\nYou can record yourself reading a bedtime story. \n\nAlso, I know it\u2019s not my life so I can\u2019t say what you should pick.  But I think the story of your dad fought every day so he could see you born would be meaningful to your son.", "Chemo\u2019s not a guarantee of anything and it puts a lot on the body. Even if he did do it, he may be too weak to be around for the birth and honestly him having a compromised immunity and being at a hospital isn\u2019t a good idea.\n\nThis is his health. It\u2019s his cancer. He gets to decide how to proceed with treatment.", "Nobody is the asshole here, this is just an impossible scenario with no winners.\n\nUltimately it boils down to what is right for Liam and how he wants to navigate this.\n\nDeepest condolences; the closest analogous situation I have is watching my grandmother succumb to brain cancer and that was impossible to deal with. I cannot fathom it happening to a spouse on the verge of having a child.\n\nMay you get through this with as much grace as possible.", "I am a chemo/radiation survivor and let me tell you, if I am ever diagnosed with cancer again, I will *NOT* be doing chemo again!\n\nWhat you need to know ...\n\n1.  Chemo is NOT a guarantee of more time.\n2.  More time does not equate to having a quality of life.\n3.  Chemo is pouring gallons of poisonous chemicals into your body that kills the bad cells AND the good cells.  It destroys you from within and doesn't guarantee it will get the cancer.\n4.  The chemo side effects are the single, hardest, most painful thing I have ever undergone.  The bone pain nearly drove me crazy and I have a high threshold of pain (I walked on a broken foot for a couple days right after I started chemo before getting it diagnosed). Nothing touches the pain.  Nothing gives you relief.  It hurts to sit, stand, and lay down.  You don't eat, you can't sleep, all you can do is pray that the end comes soon.\n5.  Baldness was the least of my worries.  Do you have any idea of what it feels like to be nauseous 24/7 for 365 days?  I am not talking upset stomach, i am talking about carrying a trash can around at work because I never knew when I would need to vomit because I felt like I was going to vomit all the time.  My doctor was treating me for the overwhelming nausea the entire time but nothing worked.  Very little stayed down.  I ended up getting regular IV supplemental nutrition which was horrible in and of itself.  \n\nOP, you can want what you want but this is not your decision.  You selfishly want him to be around for the birth - which is entirely understandable.  However you need to understand that even with chemo, he may not make it that long.  You also need to understand that just because he takes the chemo, he isn't going to be himself.  Are you going to be able to clean up his vomit when he gets sick in the muddle of the night?  Are you going to clean up after him when he is too weak to make it to the bathroom in the middle of the night?  Are you willing to stay on top of the dozens of medications he will need to take, making sure he takes them when he us supposed to in the right dosage - because chemo brain is real.  He will be able to read the pill bottles but won't be able to make sense of the directions.  When he is too weak to walk into the infusion center, will you push him in the wheelchair, even when you are 9 months pregnant?  You need to understand what you are asking and what you are getting into.\n\nThis is heartbreaking.  I get it.  But your wishes do not trump your husband's reality.  If he has made peace with his own mortality, you have no right to demand anything.  Make him comfortable and let him go.  It will be much more peaceful for him.\n\nI am sorry for you both.  OP you are an AH only if you try to force your choice on your husband.", "Chemo has awful side effects and often means that the final months of life are a torture not a blessing. The person with cancer gets to decide the path they will follow, the decision is difficult enough without anyone putting extra pressure on.", "No one is an AH, totally understand where both of your are coming from and I'm so sorry, I have absolutely no idea what I would do in your situation. \n\nThe only suggestion I have is perhaps Liam should start a video diary, share memories of your life, how you both met, how you feel about your son, about your wife, the things you wish you could be a part of. The things you'd do if you could. \nI suggest the two of you share special moments together, record and photo as many things as you can. \nThose can be the things you cherish and share with your son.", "NAH. Just pain. \nPain from an illness and treatment. Pain of loosing someone you love. Pain for not being to meet the son and having the family you\u2019ve always wanted. Pain for dreams that won\u2019t come true. \n\nTake pictures now. Do your maternity shoot. Get pictures of the two of you together.  Have him choose a special blanket and stuffed animal. Have him choose a few milestone gifts. Even if it\u2019s something you have to buy closer to when the time comes.  If it\u2019s a blanket. Take pictures of him snuggling the blanket and the stuffy. So that your son can look at them and see how excited he was and how much his dad wanted to hold him.  That his dad picked these things out for him. \nAs others have said. Make a video of him saying how much he wanted to be a dad and was looking forward to meeting him. Write letters for important days (starting school, elementary school grad? Middle school, 16th birthday, Graduation. First car, first girlfriend, first heartbreak, wedding, first grandchild). Or just journal, be it hand written or typed.  Spill thoughts of things you\u2019d want to share.  First car.  First crush. First big injury. A funny story.  Because while a picture of his dad holding him is nice, being able to hand your son an envelope or something and have dad share a story or advice is something that will last a lifetime.  That dad made sure he would know he loved him enough that he fought long enough to make sure that he\u2019d have something special for a long time.     And before you stick them in envelopes make sure you make a copy or a digital copy just encase something happens like a fire so those words never get lost. \nFocus on now because he might not make it even with the chemo. Don\u2019t put these special things off in hopes of a picture you might never get.  6 months is a long time. And as much as that might be a special picture, your husband might look like death as his body gets ravaged.  So there will always be a sadness to that picture as even if that picture is a great picture the strength and life isn\u2019t going to shine through like it would if the picture happened today.", "This isn't for AITA. But, for the bots, NAH.\n\nI don't think I would get chemo, nor would I force my husband to do so in this situation. But OP isn't the AH for wanting to spend more time with her husband, and her husband isn't the AH for wanting to try and enjoy (or at least, not hate) what little time he has left.", " NAH this is a heartbreaking situation. I think you have a right to voice your opinion as long as you recognize that it\u2019s your husbands decision in the end. Husband should hear out his wife but shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to make his last days more miserable than they have to be.", "I will say NAH, but this is not an AITA question. It\u2019s a tragic personal situation. I just finished eight rounds of chemo, but my situation is completely different because the chemo could save my life. While I understand where the wife is coming from, this is 100% the husband\u2019s decision. Cancer takes away so much of our agency. It\u2019s easy to be on the outside and say he should choose the course that will extend his life, but it is his life. My heart goes out to all three of you and your family.\n\nETA: i realized that saying I just finished 8 rounds of chemo could suggest I meant \u201cIt\u2019s not such a big deal.\u201d  I meant the absolute opposite. It is a massive deal.\n\nChemo regimens vary a lot, and people\u2019s reactions to any given chemo regimen vary a lot. But it can absolutely wreck you and the effects can be cumulative. \n\nHusband has been through it and it has been bad enough that he has decided he\u2019s through. What I meant is, I understand why he might feel that way and I respect it, however hard it might be for others to understand.", "NAH. No assholes here.\n\nI'm so deeply sorry you are going through this, but I have to take husband's side. His quality of life is far more important than the length of life. \n\nThere are many ways for son to remember his father. I would take videos, make audio recordings, leave behind letters and gifts. There are many, many ways to preserve your love for him. \n\nTo the wife- please seek a regular therapist because you're at high risk of pregnancy complications from stress and PPD. \n\nStick together until the end. I hope you both find some peace.", "NAH. I am so terribly sorry that you both have been put in this situation.\n\nTo OP: chemotherapy is brutal. At some point, value of life has to come into question. Is Liam going to be comfortable if he continues with treatment? Having your husband's best interest in mind is the best way to go forward from here.\n\nTo Liam: you're exhausted, tired of the extra work that comes with knowing a loved one is going to pass, and watching your family try to grapple with and prepare for reality. I wish you peace as you enter this final stretch.\n\nYou're both here to support each other. While I wish Liam could meet your son, maintaining his dignity is something he treasures, and that choice should be respected. Even if Liam isn't there in body for the birth of your son, he sure as hell will be in spirit.", "NAH. This isn't really an AITA situation. That said, I think it's cruel to force someone to continue to suffer. I get that you guys have wanted a family and your son is almost here, but cancer wasn't part of that plan and it can't be ignored. The timing is the pits, and I'm awfully sorry that you guys are enduring this, but I think the person with the cancer needs to be the one to decide how to spend their remaining time. Liam can write a letter or take a video for his son to have one day, you can get a lovely photo of Liam touching mom's belly. Dragging Liam through months of chemo so that he can be ill and miserable in a photo with the baby he won't get to watch grow up anyway, in my opinion, feels worse than letting him go when its his time knowing that his son will grow up loved and hearing memories of who his dad was at his best.", "NAH.\n\nAs I was once going through cancer therapy I can relate to Liam's view a lot.\n\nMonths of chemotherapy sucks the will of living out of people as those drugs make you feel miserable (side effects, lots of them). Very very miserable. And that feeling increases from cycle to cycle. I went through this and know exactly how it feels. It just wears people out.\n\nI had a chance of surviving, but trust me, at some point I wanted to throw in the towel anyway because I felt so bad. Words to describe this feeling escape me at the moment. My apologies.\n\nHowever, I had support from my family to go through this time and finished chemotherapy. Without them I wouldn't be typing this.\n\nBut: I am also a dad and seeing my child for the first time is an experience I dont want to have missed.\n\nI hope you guys find an agreement on this one.", "My thoughts and prayers are with you both. I can\u2019t imagine how incredibly painful this is for you both.\n\nI understand both sides of this situation.\n\nSo here is my suggestion. Sit down and write letters to your son for birthday, for graduation, for his wedding, for when he becomes a father. Leave these letters with your family go give to him at appropriate times.\n\nAlso record messages for him to watch. This way he gets to not only have written letters but he can hear your voice. He will cherish all of these.\n\nNow for the hard part. As a internet stranger this is my take. You and your wife can either give up on the chemo and spend what precious time you have left with each other. Maybe take a second honeymoon. Do something that you both have always wanted to do. But spend quality time. And only GOD knows but you may be around in 6 months and see your son. No one knows when their life will be up but you would spend the time you have left enjoying the people you love the most. You can decorate your son\u2019s nursery.\n\nOr \n\nYou and your wife can decide to fight continue the chemo. You will be constantly at the hospital. You will be week and tired. Your life will revolve around dr and hospitals. You will more time but not quality time with your family. You will not feel like doing anything. You will be existing not living. And the sad fact is you still may not make it to see your child born. \n\nThis is a heartbreaking situation. There is no right answer. \n\nBut no matter what you do please leave your son with memories of you. You and your wife fix up a box with letters and home movies. I think this may be your happy compromise.\n\n\nFor your wife. Let me leave you with this thought. Do you want your last memories of your life with your husband to be of one\u2019s with hospitals and him suffering. Or do you want your last memories of him to be dancing with you in the rain, or walking on a beach. Or even decorating your sons nursery. The picture you want for your son will not show him the man his father is. It will show him the father that was sick. That was tired. \n\nYour memories will be what your son holds on too. So make those memories happier ones instead of ones of him suffering and stuck in a hospital.", "love him unconditionally. it\u2019s his choice, support it.", "NAH. there could never be assholes in this situation. OP, honey, your husband is making the hardest choice he\u2019s ever had to make. would you rather have him by your side a little longer, miserable, in pain, living unhappily, or would you rather enjoy the short time you guys have together as quality time, not counting the days until Liam\u2019s condition worsens anyway and he passes? \n\nyou\u2019re not an asshole, honey, but i\u2019m siding with your husband here. i know you do love your son and you know your husband does, too, but it obviously is hard for him to project into a relationship with a baby he will maybe never even meet, or only for a very short period of time the baby will in no way be able to remember. your husband wants to focus on you, the love of his life, whom he knows and knows how to take care of.\n\nlet him take care of you while he still can, don\u2019t make him undergo chemo and make him regret living every additional day, agonizing in pain. he will not be able to father your baby, let him enjoy being your husband while he still can.\n\ngood luck to the two of you, for whatever the future holds. i\u2019ll keep you in my prayers.", "THE SOFTEST YTA I CAN GIVE. SO SOFT IT'S LIKE COTTON CANDY. \n\nThis is an awful time for both of you.\n\nI understand why you would want him to do chemo, but I've seen what it does to a person. It's not nice. By the time your son is born, your husband (on chemo) will most likely be tired, cranky, and sickly.\n\nIt's best that you respect his decision in not taking the treatment. Help him live the rest of his days happily because that's honestly all you can do.\n\nGood luck, guys.", "There are no good answers here; my personal take is to have Liam follow whatever treatment he wants to follow. Miserable and sick life doesn\u2019t help anyone, if he can feel better and make some positive memories, that\u2019s what I\u2019d want. Use the time to write letters to your child, advice,memories, hopes, dreams, etc. have bucket list experiences with wife\u2026make positive memories instead of having the last months be painful. Wife will actually remember these times, baby won\u2019t. And it doesn\u2019t sound like chemo really gives you any real advantages. \n\nHaving said that, it\u2019s easy for me to sit on the outside and not have to experience what you\u2019re both going through. \n\nNAH.", "NAH - this is an impossible situation. I am so sorry you guys are dealing with this, and I want to cry on your behalf...\n\nLiam - do not feel guilty about wanting to live your last few months feeling relatively good and being there for your wife. There is beauty in living a full, but short life. Liam's Wife - don't pressure him. Make all the memories you can while he's here. Take a million pictures with the belly and with you. Do the things you've put off doing. He may make it to see his baby born, but if he's in treatment he'll be miserable and just existing. Make the most of his LIFE.\n\nSending so much love your guys' way!", "Soft YTA\nI understand your point of view, but your husband is suffering. Why make him suffer for so many months just so he can meet his son? Also it\u2019s his body, his decision. I recently lost my mom to a very fast, brutal cancer (her prognosis was the same as your husband\u2019s) and she tried chemo, but suffered too much and so stopped. Chemo did almost nothing for her except make the little time she had, worse than she was.\nI am so sorry this is happening to you guys. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. One thing I can advise is to make memories while you can, especially videos.", "NAH. This is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade.", "My thoughts and prayers are with you all, but ultimately, Liam, it\u2019s your body, your choice.

So sorry for what both of you are loosing.", "this is above reddits pay grade, so NAH. \n\nBut i will offer you my own little story. Growing up one of my Best friends was raised by her mother and stepfather ( she calls him dad as he cam into her life at 1yo), because her dad passed away from cancer 3 months after she was born. They found out very similar timing to you and he did chemo so he could hold his little girl. She is now a woman in her mid 20's and every year on her bio fathers Bday that she loves and misses him. The picture of him holding her as a baby is one of the most precious things she owns. She has it in her first home with her partner and even though he was so sick she is so thankful she has that of him. ( her stepdad was great and they have a great relationship too).", "Christ, this is tough. To get it out of the way NAH.

There's no guarantee that chemo will prolong Liam's life beyond your delivery date. There's no guarantee that stopping chemo will mean Liam isn't present for this child's birth. The only guarantee is that Liam's quality of life in his final days will be horrible if he continues the treatments. Please don't force him. \n\nLiam, I'm so sorry that you have to deal with this. You have a right to quality of life in your final days.  It's your call, and no one else's. If you want to stop, stop.", "NAH.  You are both going through something horrible.  Can you create a video message to play for your son?  That way he has something and your wife has a keepsake.\n\nI'm so sorry.  Ultimately, dad, it's your decision.  If you need to stop chemo, go ahead and make the arrangements you need to make.", "Obviously no one is an AH, but my vote is for Liam to have the choice & dignity of deciding how to spend the last few moments of his life.", "Soft YTA. My step mom got diagnosed stage 4 pancreatic cancer. She quit chemo after one round. Chemo is torture and it\u2019s selfish to ask a human to torture themselves for your own comfort and closure. Let them die in peace and *enjoy* the last of their life. This simply cannot happen if they\u2019re on chemotherapy. The dinners that I had with my step mom after she finished chemo are some of the most treasured moments I was so blessed to have.", "YTA\n\nLook I'm really sorry to both of you. But even if Liam gets chemo, there is no guarantee he will be well enough to be present at the birth and he's not going to have any quality of life when meeting your baby. \n\nLiam's decisions and feelings about continuing chemo take precedence here. But OP, aside from that, you're seeing up situation where your husband is going into hospice care while you have a small infant to care for.

Me and my husband (29M) and before I start, I realize that you are internet strangers but we want a third opinion and it never hurts trying.\r  \n\r  \nMy husband (let's call him Liam) has blood cancer and it's been diagnosed too late, the doctor told us he's going to live a year and half or so, best guesses, if he gets treated, a few months without it. I'm pregnant, 3 months.\r  \n\r  \n**My perspective:**\r  \n\r  \nLiam is going to die, words are not enough to express the feelings I have right now and God knows that but I keep crying whenever I remember it so I just want to be strong for once and write how I feel. Liam and I always wanted to have a family, that's all that we ever wished for, and when we finally started it, he's going to disappear. It's not his fault, I'm never blaming him but I just want him to witness the birth of his son, just a photo of him and his son together, something to remember him by and something that my son is going to see in the future and something that doesn't make him regret it later.\r  \n\r  \nI just don't want him gone without knowing that his son is finally alive and healthy, I just want to have that moment but he doesn't want to keep getting chemo because he feels terrible, it's just a few months more, I keep telling him to hang on a little bit and he feels so conflicted right now.\r  \n\r  \n**Liam's perspective:**\r  \n\r  \nI never wanted to have chemo but my wife pressured me to do it, I understand how she feels and how my whole extended family feels, they want to see me more, they want to have more memories with me, they want to enjoy life with me a bit longer, but I can't I just can't do it anymore, my head is hairless, I feel so tired that I can't go to the gym like I used to anymore, it just hurts and I feel awful. What's the point of living if I can't enjoy it anymore? Just to see my son? I love my son before he's even born so so much but I don't even know if he's going to like me being miserable in a photo, I want to leave with dignity and I don't want him to see me like this 10 years later. I followed the treatment plan in the beginning for my wife and parents and siblings and all but I don't think I want to continue anymore and now she keeps trying to convince me to do otherwise. \r  \n\r  \nWe want your opinions. What would you do if you were in my place? AITA (the wife) for telling him to keep getting the treatment? AITA (Liam) for wanting to stop?\r  \n\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wonder if your husband went off chemo with that extra energy and peace what you could to to plan some memories and special moments for your child in the future. \n\nI understand you want your husband at the birth and that photo of him with your child, but perhaps that energy can be better spent now filming videos or writing letters. There have to be other options to have a presence and an impact in your child\u2019s life for years to come, while also respecting your husbands wish to discontinue treatment that is ruining his quality of life. I do believe the old adage of quality over quantity. \n\nIm so sorry again for you both and wishing you love and peace in the time you have together", "Had a good friend who was taking chemo.

Support him as he tries to leave with some dignity.", "A very soft YTA.  I completely understand wanting your husband to meet your baby & being able to have a photo of them together\u2026BUT, your husband must be absolutely miserable to not want that for himself.

The quality of life the person undergoing chemo has is barely worth living because the toll of the chemo has on the remaining healthy tissues is devastating. You're not wrong for wanting your husband to continue treatment, but in the end, do you want his last month with you to be remembered as the worst months of his life? You want happy, joyous memories, so making him continue chemo will rob him of peace and you of happy memories. \n\nThis situation is devastating, no matter how you approach it. Live in the present and don't focus on the future that will never be. It would be a heaven sent gift for your husband to see his son before passing, however that may not be in the cards.

You both have valid points.\n\nIt's extremely difficult to lose someone so young and it's perfectly normal to want to spend as much time with them as possible.

I've given her explicit instructions that if that were to ever happen to me to just let me go and not prolong anything.\n\nOP, your husband should put together a book with as many moments from his life as you can possibly get together.  Graduations, birthdays, your wedding, etc.  Maybe some handwritten blurbs from him.  Just something, anything, that you can show your child one day and say \"look how great your dad was\".

She quit chemo after one round because the effects were so terrible that she ended up in the hospital. She ended up living just over one year. Nothing in life is certain. I don't think I'd choose to live in misery, knowing that I was going to die regardless.", "NAH\n\nOP, from one pregnant woman to another, I can empathize with you. However, this has to be a decision Liam makes, and especially sounding like he didn't want chemo from the beginning, it seems he has made peace with his battle.\n\nI'm so sorry you are going through this and I can't even imagine the fear and sadness you may be feeling..but chemo is hard on the body and mind. If he can go out on what feels like his own terms in this awful situation then please support that.\n\nLiam, I am sorry for this horrid situation. Consider maybe leaving some audio vocals behind maybe like a journal or even physically write a journal to him. Just talk to your son; it doesn't necessarily have to be about anything important or it could be. You could talk about what you did that day, how you met your wife, how much you love him or teach him things you wanted to teach him.\n\nI hope you two can make the best of the rest of your time together \u2665\ufe0f", "This is one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever read. Wow I\u2019m so beyond sorry. He\u2019s 29 and dealing with that I really am sorry. This truly is beyond Reddit opinion but I\u2019m going to speak to both sides:\nLiam\u2019s perspective- I can\u2019t even begin to understand the pain and suffering from cancer. If I were you I\u2019d feel the same. You already feel awful and chemo will just add to it. However, I can\u2019t imagine going quicker than I could. I would want to spend every second with my wife and son so that\u2019s my honest answer on that but I get how hard that could be given the pain you\u2019re already enduring. \nOP\u2019s perspective- I can\u2019t even begin to understand what you\u2019re feeling. Losing your husband at 29 with a child on the way\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. I understand you want him to stick around to witness the birth but you have to respect his decision and it truly is his to make. The fact is that he will pass from this and even chemo is just postponing the inevitable and that\u2019s awful but he is the only one who can dictate what his body is feeling and if he wants to go sooner that\u2019s up to him. \nAgain to both of you I\u2019m so so sorry\u2026 I pray for you both", "NAH. But it is Liam\u2019s body. He\u2019s sick. The chemo is keeping him alive for people other than himself. His life is pain and discomfort. I can\u2019t imagine how heartbreaking it is to know that he will never know his son, and vice versa. But chemo is poison, and while the poison can cure, it can make you so very very sick and it\u2019s not going to cure Liam. \n\nI am so sorry for what you\u2019re both going through. I think, instead of a photo, Liam could try writing letters for his son\u2019s milestones, to be opened when he\u2019s older. Obviously this will take effort and be tiring, so start with the big ones - starting kindergarten, driver\u2019s license, graduation, first date, etc. Maybe the two of you could put together an \u201cAbout My Dad\u201d scrapbook: dad\u2019s memories, favorite things, favorite photos. Work on it together.", "NAH\n\nBut I'm on the dying man's side. One's death is a personal choice, only he feels when enough is enough.", "NAH...this is so deep and heavy that there is no right answer. Liam deserves to be comfortable, and it's understandable that you want him to witness the birth of his child. Don't let any of this sour the time you have left together. Maybe start making videos together that you can show your son as he grows up. Write some letters and do voice recordings for milestones; lost first tooth, first day of school, 10th birthday, prom, wedding, and so on. Liam, maybe leave some letters for your wife too. There is no way to make this easy, for either of you, or any of your family. Just soak in all the love and joy you possibly can right now.", "NAH. This is a horrible situation for everyone involved. In terms of photos, the only photos of me with my dying grandpa (also cancer) are very sad. But thankfully I'm too young to remember him like that, and many more photos of him are young and happy. Kiddo will be too young to remember. \n\nBut also, chemo SUCKS. This is why some people refuse treatment - it isn't just the hair loss, but the exhaustion and nausea and all the debilitating side effects that make a patient feel like passing on is better.\n\nNo one is being selfish here. It's all a horrible, impossible scenario. Whatever happens your husband will die and you'll be a widow with a baby. Will a photo change that for you? Will it change it for your kid?\n\n(From being the kid in this kinda similar perspective, as I have a very close relationship with my grandma who helped raise me, it is nice to have those couple of photos of Grandpa holding me.)", "This is such a kind and thoughtful answer, with a lovely solution. Bravo. \ud83d\udc4f", "I wish I had an award to give you, as this took the words right out of my mouth. Very kind of you to offer your services as an artist as well.", "I second this person\u2019s comment.\n\nYou are both in an impossible position, but ultimately it is Liam\u2019s decision. \n\nWhen I was 19 \u2026 many many many years ago \u2026 my mom was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. My dad pressured her into treatment. She lived less than a year from her initial diagnosis, the cancer spread to her brain and her last six months were awful. It was emotionally devastating on our family. I have so many good memories of her but my last ones are traumatic. \n\nI know that my dad\u2019s request was made out of sadness, shock, avoidance, love, concern \u2026 very human reasons, but it took away any time she could have done some last hurrah whims and it made the end of her life more painful.", "THIS. \n\nI was going to suggest this too.   Record yourself.  Write letters.  Maybe setup an gmail account just to email to your future son and give advice, thoughts, pictures , whatever.", "This is an amazing idea.", "Agreed.  Chemo is fucking brutal, we can express our wishes to loved ones, but it\u2019s ultimately each person\u2019s decision what they\u2019re willing to tolerate.", "Soft, soft YTA. Confronting death and accepting it is one of life\u2019s hardest tasks. If Liam is there, let him go. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone to meet their baby and then know that they can\u2019t be around for their life.", "Very similar to what I was going to say. Super soft YWBTA (the wife), and I am so so sorry this is happening to y\u2019all.\n\nBest wishes for everyone involved \u2764\ufe0f\n\n(eta the W B)", "Fuck cancer.  I miss my mom so much.", "Great idea \u2764\ufe0f", "There\u2019s a No Assholes Here judgement option if you\u2019d like to use that instead", "It\u2019s called NAH (no assholes here)", "There\u2019s a No Assholes Here judgement for when you don\u2019t think anyone is in the wrong. Just FYI", "....The only thing you got out of this was the photo?\n\nYou completely glossed over getting to spend as much time with him as possible, giving him the joy of seeing his son (even if it's only once), having the time to say his proper goodbyes, all of that?\n\nOP wasn't even the one that mentioned the photo, ffs.", "Wow, the gross take on the thread. Their kid is clearly wanted, suggesting someone abort a child they clearly love and have zero desire to abort is horrible.", "Seriously? Seriously??", "This is not the question they asked. Clearly they have made that decision, otherwise they wouldn't have posted what they did. I'm sure both OPs are going through enough hell as it is without people suggesting they lose a child they already say they love as well.\n\nOPs, I'm so sorry you're in this situation. I can't even imagine. All I can suggest is encouraging Liam to go through treatment he doesn't want, rather than allowing him to go on his own terms, could make him resentful in his final months. But I completely understand your stance, I imagine I'd feel the same in your position and want to hang onto every last second by any means.\n\nSending as much strength and comfort as I can muster, although I can't imagine it will be of much help.", "What the fuck is this take", "i\u2019d imagine she views the fetus as a part of her husband, and doesn\u2019t want to lose it.", "Incredibly heartless comment."]}
