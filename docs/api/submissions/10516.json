In the context I described, it's flirty and playful. \n\nCalling someone \"elderly\" is not flirty or playful, it's just an insult (to a young person, and 30 is too young) and was unnecessary, particularly in front of mutual friends.

But again, you\u2019re not an AH.

If anything, you\u2019re mentioning that you\u2019re aware of the age gap but love her anyway. Her reaction makes me think that maybe she sees a problem with the age gap and bringing it up makes her feel insecure about it. Has she handled other jokes well? Or does she hate joking around at all? I think you need to have a conversation about how you both feel about the age gap and yeah, I wouldn\u2019t joke about her age anymore. But honestly, if my partner made fun of me for being elderly at 30, I\u2019d make fun of them for being a child at 22. Then we\u2019d both laugh and enjoy each other.\n\nAlso, why are we acting like someone being 30 is a fucking disability. Like you made fun of her for being in a wheelchair or some shit?

I would make a joke like that and my SO could dish it back to me just as much. I\u2019m gonna say NTA but be careful since not everybody can joke around like that.  Seems she may be really insecure about the age gap and feels out of place with you in a social setting. Gonna have to get past that for it to work. Hope it can for you.

Are you owning your words and the hurt they caused or are you just trying to whitewash it with flowers?\n\nBTW, I'm in my 40's, so I must be positively geriatric in your eyes. I'll just go grab my zimmer frame so I can try to wade through your opinion of what a joke is.", "Get laughs by being funny, not by insulting someone.", "you need to learn now in life and not later that insulting someone is not a joke, take your own insecurity and have someone call you out on it then call it a joke and see how you feel.", "But *why* did you think it would \u201cget some laughs?\u201d", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "!!! Exactly. She\u2019s bothered by the joke because she knows the age gap is uncomfortable. Lmao. If she were 30 and he were 29 and he made that joke the reaction would\u2019ve been completely different", "This!!", "but it\u2019s not like you joked in private you made a cruel joke infront of a crowd of mutual friends", "Please explain to us why you think that telling a room full of people that \"you could be dating a cheerleader or sorority girl\" (a euphemism for a stereotypical hot chick) but instead you're dating an\"elderly\" chick is a hilarious joke. What's the \"joke\" exactly? That your gf isn't hot? That she's over the hill and ready for the nursing home, but you \"love her anyway\"? Holy shit, that's a back slapper dude, I'm falling out of my chair with laughter at that one.", "That is even worse. You chose to poke fun of her in front of everyone.", "So now you know how that sort of thing goes, eh?", "You messed up so freaking massively and if you can\u2019t see that, no one here can help you. YTA.", "It's over dude. You've poisoned the well, there's no coming back from that one.", "How does an established joke start besides an initial joke? I agree that if the joke offends the person it\u2019s about, then you should apologize and not do it again, but I don\u2019t think trying it was wrong.", "Ok and? Why get hurt over a joke? My husband's parents have a big age difference and they joked about it and his mom still jokes about it with us after his Dad's passing a year ago. If you can't handle being in an age gap relationship and can't handle jokes about it then maybe that's not the right relationship for you and you should find someone closer in age to you.", "Again, if she can't handle the age gap difference and it's a problem for her then she isn't going to handle anyone else making jokes about it as well as some people out here who don't support those types of relationships and make actual negative comments that aren't jokes.", "The eight years isn\u2019t even that bad by itself. There\u2019s nothing creepy about a 52 year-old dating someone who just turned 60. Early twenties dating early thirties is the classic, though, of \u201cnot illegal but definitely creepy\u201d age gap. The older partner never looks good!", "Which is probably a lesson she is learning!", "His joke was very on brand for 22 year olds. We all make jokes about how people in their 30s are old it isn\u2019t literal. We know 30 isn\u2019t old. I feel like if you think it\u2019s old or you feel old that\u2019s your problem. \n\nSomeone\u2019s \u201cold\u201d to me when they\u2019re 80. But to each their own", "She knew that when she dated a 22 year-old. The girlfriend can\u2019t be let off the hook by dating someone obviously too young for her and then being confronted by the reality of his being too young for her. She\u2019s supposed to be the mature one!", "the affection I was referring to was, after the joke I hugged her", "I tried for the better part of the evening to get her to re-engage, she just kept turning away and rolling her eyes", "because it was a complete 180 from something I'd normally say.", "[deleted]", "Probably in a more private setting. Not really the kind of joke you should test out in front of all her friends, ya know?", "Here's the thing, you don't get to decide what is offensive to anyone but yourself. Just because you wouldn't be bothered by it doesn't mean OP's gf is wrong for it bothering her.", "That\u2019s different though. Those are full fledged adults. I\u2019m not gonna tell a grown man at 52 what they can and can\u2019t do", "22 and 30 passes the \"half plus seven\" rule.", "i\u2019m 22 and my fianc\u00e9 is 21, only six months younger than me, and he always jokes about \u201cmy age\u201d. sometimes it\u2019s calling me a cougar, sometimes it\u2019s calling me old, he\u2019s even called me \u201cgranny\u201d once. it\u2019s just a stupid joke that people our age find funny for whatever reason. \n\ni bought my sister (who turned 30 in October) a walker for her birthday and she even thought it was hilarious. it\u2019s good to have a sense of humor especially when you\u2019re not even near mid-life.", "I completely agree! My husband joke about our age difference behind closed doors and out in public. Plus his parents had a bigger age gap than we do and they always joked about it and his mom still does after his Dad passed away. Like it's not that big of a deal. If you have insecurities about being in an age gap relationship then it's not the one for you and you should definitely find someone closer in age to avoid those kinds of insecurities. If you can't have a sense of humor about something like that with your partner then how are you going to handle people who don't joke about it because they are against it? Because people will make negative comments. Not every one can handle an age gap relationship and that's ok but if it's not something for YOU then make sure you date people closer to your age or people in the age range that you are comfortable with.", "Would you really want to be touched by someone who just massively hurt you?", "You\u2019re right it\u2019s not toddlers like. It\u2019s abusive. Insult then affection is a toxic pattern.", "I would too if I were her. YTA.", "I think that means you shouldn\u2019t have said it.", "Like these jokes are just what they are", "Sure, maybe that type of joke one on one is better, but if you\u2019re set up for the joke in that moment, that\u2019s when you\u2019re gonna say it.", "There is no reason to be that sensitive. But if you want to live your life miserable like that then by all means that's on you.", "You\u2019re clearly in an age gap relationship and feel guilty about it since you\u2019re coming this hard at random people", "I agree! OP is just young enough that he\u2019s an adult but not fully done maturing yet. I\u2019m side-eyeing heavily a thirty something wanting to date someone in their early twenties (like, it can be okay! But it\u2019s concerning enough to raise automatic flags)", "Literally it\u2019s common gen z humor", "It was to show her I was just kidding & that I loved her", "She\u2019s predatory. She\u2019s a 30 woman dating a fresh 22yr old college graduate. If she\u2019s insecure about dating someone so much younger than her why is she doing it? \n\nIn fact, why isn\u2019t she dating someone around her own age? Maybe there\u2019s some issues that should be considered. We could talk about the power dynamics issues because of ages and experience.", "Stupid assumption, especially since I'm not \"coming hard\" at anyone.", "No it\u2019s definitely questionable my 33 year old co worker said she\u2019d feel very uncomfortable and gross dating someone my age. \n\nConversations like this just remind me that Leonardo DiCaprio is a sicko", "Yes but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  \n\nReread what they wrote.  After someone hurts you, do you want them touching you.  Would a hug comfort you immediately after they insulted you? \n\nProbably not.", "No, showing you love her is not making a a joke like that ever. And someone said you look cute together. Instead of saying you know, thanks, you insulted her and said you could do better"]}
