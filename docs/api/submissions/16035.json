{"id": 16035, "submission_id": "133hgpt", "title": "AITA for not inviting my brother and sister in law to meet my baby because they didn't have visitors for three months after they had their baby?", "selftext": "When my sister in law had her son approx 7 months ago her and my brother did the \"we're taking this time as a family and we won't be having visitors in the hospital or meeting the baby for the first couple months, thanks for respecting our time etc\" thing and they did not have any visitors over for the first three months as she said. I totally respected this. Brother didn't rly care about visitors either way but she specifically didn't want any visitors. So anyway I had my baby two weeks ago and I did have visitors in the hospital and at my house and my close family members (mom, sisters, cousins, god mother, aunts and uncles, grandparents) except my brother and his wife. Yesterday I had a family dinner where my family came over and cooked for me and held the baby etc. Some people posted pics of this get together on social media. I DID NOT POST THEM! My sister in law saw these pics and was like I would love to meet the baby bla bla bla. She told my brother to ask why they weren't invited. Brother didn't really care he just asked on her behalf. I was like y'all can meet my baby after three months. Thank you for respecting my choice. You didn't want me to meet my nephew for three months, so you can meet your niece after three months. So now she posted a subtweet about me and I don't get why. She didn't let people meet her baby for three months so why should I let her meet mine? I respected her choice so I don't understand what the problem is.", "created_utc": 1682835172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133hgpt/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brother_and_sister_in/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whereas when they told everyone they could visit after three months that rule applied to everyone. No one got special treatment. When they had their kid. \n\n\nIt looks like you took it personally though.\n\nYTA", "YTA and being very petty as everyone else was invited to visit yours,  and the three month rule for your niece applied to everyone.  There are reasons why some parents say no visitors for a while. Post birth recovery, post natal depression, unusual mother / baby health issues, for example", "YTA, they had a blanket rule for everyone which helped Mom recover after giving birth. Lots of hormones and emotions and firsts! Can be a very stressful time for some. It\u2019s clear you took that personally and are now singling them out to try to prove some non existent point.", "My gosh you are very petty aren\u2019t you.\nYTA. \nYou invited everyone but them.\nThey invited no one.", "YTA. \n\nThey didn't exclude you and just you from meeting their daughter. Everyone had the same rules. You don't have the same rules for your child but are already using your newborn as a pawn for your pettiness.", "YTA. \n\nYou singled her out while she treated everyone the same.\n\nHer motivation was keeping her baby safe from germs and all of them bonding as a nuclear family.\n\nYour motivation was to be spiteful.", "YTA you are a very petty immature individual", "YTA. You claim you respected their decision but in reality you got offended and decided to retaliate when you had a baby. They made a blanket request for privacy to allow them to have private time. You chose to solely bar them for visiting purely out of spite and pettiness because they denied you access to their child.", "YTA.  Wow.  Your baby\u2019s birth is being used as a weapon to punish another mother for their parenting choice by excluding them from the family.  I\u2019m sure this won\u2019t breed resentment at all.  I hope you like uncomfortable holidays, because you don\u2019t easily come back from that.  I\u2019m sure the cousins wouldn\u2019t have been friends anyway.", "YTA they made a decision based on their health and abilities and the safety of their baby that applied to everyone and was in no way targeted. You are specifically excluding them simply to be petty.", "YTA for being offended at your brother and SIL's requirement that they isolated during the newborn period. WTF? They were entitled to make that decision as have many parents in recent times, but you clearly don't respect them for it.\n\nFor someone old enough to make a baby, you sure don't sound done maturing.", "YTA, you're being very immature. Don't weaponise your child.", "YTA. You're doing it specifically towards them. They applied it to everyone equally. You're doing it just to hurt them. They didn't. It's clear why you're in the wrong.", "YTA\n\nHas it not occurred to you (or occurred to some people in this thread) that she could have been recovering medically? \n\nGiving birth is physically traumatising. My own sister almost died from sepsis and took much longer to recover. Many medical issues can be embarrassing such as prolapses so she might not want to tell everyone. She could have had ppd or a number of other complications. \n\nTaking time to recover is really normal and not something you should punish someone over.\n\nYou're being weird either way.", "Yeah, you\u2019re a mom now. Grow up and stop being so petty. You sound like a little kid - she didn\u2019t\u2026so why should I? YTA. Seriously, grow up.", "Oh YTA and you know it.", "Evidently, you did not respect their choice, if you\u2019re choosing to single them out like this. Seems rather childish.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA. They didn't want ANY visitors, and it's their right to make that choice. You are having visitors, but excluding them in some childish revenge-thing. It seems increadibly petty and immature.", "This behavior is so petty. \n\nYou know you singled them out to shove this in their face.\n\nThey were fair to all family members across the board.\n\nYou are unfair only to them on purpose. To prove some point?\n\nIt\u2019s so rude.\n\nYTA big time.", "Yeah YTA your doing this out of revenge because you took it personal. everybody had the same rules applied to them but you just singled them out and treated them differently. Let\u2019s be honest here this was for revenge and spite.", "While it's your choice when you let people meet your child, YTA because you're just petty, and this kind of revenge is so underhanded and mean. They had their own values around their family life, and they asked everyone to respect that. You have your own values around family life, and choose to exclude them because you just can't get over yourself. Such an *ss", "YTA for being petty.\n\nYour sister-in-law had a rule that applied to everyone.\n\nYou have a rule that applied to only her.", "How old are you?", "YTA. They didn\u2019t have ANY visitors. You\u2019ve had everyone (by the sounds of it) and pettily not invited them over. You\u2019ve had a baby now, time to grow up", "YTA\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a safety concern of yours or a blanket rule. You were comfortable having people around your baby, but singled them out in a tit-for-tat that makes no sense.\n\nYou\u2019re also the AH for saying \u201cI totally respected this\u201d when clearly you didn\u2019t.", "Hmmm, sounds like you ran and got pregnant pretty soon after she did too. Do you sing the little mermaid song to yourself? Well it's your turn now lol", "YTA\n\nThey weren\u2019t having any visitors. You were. You weren\u2019t establishing general boundaries, you were just excluding them to be petty and vindictive.", "It\u2019s true man. Unfortunately YTA because: your nephew didn\u2019t crack you or your husband\u2019s ass, you can\u2019t demand what is done with your nephew. Period. You\u2019re acting like a big fat baby by having this stipulation solely because of the fact that *you\u2019re mad*. It\u2019s time to grow up.", "YTA, you supposedly respected her choice, but you sound so vindictive.", "YTA. They didn't want ANYONE, you didn't want them specifically. There's a huge difference. You do not \"totally respect\" their choice and are doing this just to take revenge.", "NTA overall\n\nI think it\u2019s a bit hypocritical of your SIL to message you that she\u2019d like to meet your baby after not allowing anyone to meet hers for a few months. \n\nDid you single her out? Yeah. Was it kind of petty? Yeah. But \u201cWhat\u2019s good for the goose\u2026.\u201d \n\nYou applied her rules to her. In a way, but still petty, you could say that you were only respecting the rules she set down.", "LMFAO you are so petty I love it!\n\nNTA so you don't like SIL no one said you have to love everyone in your family.", "YTA but thats not a bad thing. I would do the same.", "Petty but NTA.", "LOL. She totally deserved it and sometimes you have to be an A-hole just to make a point.", "Imma say ESH\nYou are petty but it's your baby at the end of the dsy so it's really your choice", "NTA sometimes being petty is good. She wanted no one to meet baby for 3 months you only wanted them to not meet baby for 3 months. \n\nHer baby her rules your baby your rules. She did like your rules you did not like hers. \n\nWas it petty LOL of course it was. \n\n3 months is a long time to not let anyone in the family meet a new born. \n\n2 wrongs don\u2019t make it right but it sure is funny as hell\n\nWell done", "YTA. You singled them out. It\u2019s not like they said YOU couldn\u2019t see the baby it was EVERYONE. So you are just being spiteful and seeking revenge. Grow up dude. Also if you are mad about something use your words not passive aggressive nibbling with holding.", "Yta. She didn't single you out. She had a reasonable boundary  for everyone based on her comfort needs after.giving birth. \n\nYou obviously  don't have the same needs which is fine. But your making the decision based on being bitter that they had a boundary you didn't like not because it's what you feel is best for you and your baby like she did.", "YTA she made the choice not to have ANY visitors to bond and heal, some people do that and it is absolutely fine, some don't and welcome visitors if they feel up to it like you did, she didn't exclude you on purpose like you did, using a child to hurt someone is pathetic, grow up.", "Oh boy, you are overplaying your hand here. Big time. \u2018I didn\u2019t get to see my niece for three months, so now you have to wait 3 months for your nephew\u2019 lmao. \n\nListen hon, just because your newborn is the centre of your universe, doesn\u2019t mean the entire world resolves around him. You are weaponising him like it\u2019s a severe punishment that they don\u2019t get to see him for a couple of months, while in reality you don\u2019t sound that close with them anyways so you\u2019re more likely pushing them further away. \n\nThere comes a time that the \u2018honeymoon\u2019 fase of a newborn is over, and you are personally making sure that there is a big divide in your family when that time has come. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. The difference between you is that they had NO visitors the first three month, but they are the only family members that you are leaving out because you're butthurt for whatever reason and that's just petty at that point.", "NTA WHAT goes around comes around", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Neither you nor your baby gained anything from this.", "^ this\n\nThey are entitled to their rules, you are entitled to yours.
