I totally respected this. Brother didn't rly care about visitors either way but she specifically didn't want any visitors.

Yesterday I had a family dinner where my family came over and cooked for me and held the baby etc. Some people posted pics of this get together on social media. I DID NOT POST THEM! My sister in law saw these pics and was like I would love to meet the baby bla bla bla. She told my brother to ask why they weren't invited. Brother didn't really care he just asked on her behalf. I was like y'all can meet my baby after three months. Thank you for respecting my choice. You didn't want me to meet my nephew for three months, so you can meet your niece after three months. So now she posted a subtweet about me and I don't get why. She didn't let people meet her baby for three months so why should I let her meet mine?

My brother is indifferent about it. Why?0", "A lot more new parents are restricting people for the first 3 mo or so until vax immunization and such have a chance to protect the child. It\u2019s way easier than trying to say you don\u2019t want unvaxed people around your newborn.\n\nit helps prevent things like hurt feelings family drama. Unlike OP\u2019s exclusion. Yeah petty and totally TA. That said, if SIL\u2019s baby is in daycare it would be quite a reasonable reason to limit those germs. Daycare and school aged kids are real germ factories.", "Yup. People hate a boundary they can\u2019t cross.", "There\u2019s also a very big difference of giving birth to a baby in the middle of cold, flu season and giving birth to baby during the warmer months, and being able to have an outdoor picnic when it comes to passing on illness risks\u2026", "No, she\u2019s not \u201cmaking a choice of her own\u201d - she\u2019s retaliating", "That would of been around the time of RSV outbreaks", "The OP is allowed to establish whatever boundary she deems appropriate. If one of those boundaries is \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want me to meet your baby for 3 months, then I don\u2019t want you to meet my baby for 3 months,\u201d then that\u2019s the way it goes.\n\nI probably wouldn\u2019t have gone about it in the way the OP did, but I understand her motivation behind her choice. I would\u2019ve/might\u2019ve called my brother and said something along the lines of \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to allow some members of the family to be at the hospital and then at our home in the days following the birth. I know that you and SIL don\u2019t agree with that approach, so we don\u2019t want to put you in an uncomfortable position. We look forward to getting together with you this summer.\u201d\n\nPassive aggressive? Sure. Petty? Yeah. But the OP is only holding SIL to her own boundary.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying, but I think it\u2019s ridiculous for the SIL to say she\u2019d love to meet the OP\u2019s baby when she didn\u2019t allow anyone to meet her baby that soon. The argument could be made that the SIL didn\u2019t care if the OP (SIL\u2019s SIL) wanted to meet her baby so why should OP care or assume that SIL would want to meet her newborn? \n\nAs I made clear, I think the OP could be considered petty. However, I also believe the argument could be made that the SIL is being \u201ctone deaf.\u201d", "Only you and I am grateful for that", "Thank you! SIL got to make her choice, and I think that if OP wants to show her the consequences of that choice she has every right to. Is it petty? Absolutely, but again, it\u2019s her choice. \n\nPersonally I think three months is way overboard- SIL took a serious bonding opportunity away from family members; why should she get to bond with her newborn niece?", "Brother and SIL would be very hypocritical to visit, since they believe that early visits are damaging.", "Don't stress yourself, that commenter is either 14 or an extremely maladjusted, mentally ill individual.", "Singled out everyone doesn\u2019t work", "Most importantly, it's so *childish* \n\nI'm horrified OP has a child when OP is behaving like she's in kindergarten.", "RSV has been an big issue lately.

I\u2019d like to hear the justification.", "Unlikely", "We dont know why they didnt want people to visit.", "Could be damaging for the mother?? Have you thought that maybe SIL knew her ILs are petty aholes so she didn't want to deal with a newborn, postpartum AND them? \n\nOP is YTA, Undoubtedly.", "Fixed it to excluded", "My cousin refused to let anyone see his kid unless they had the whooping cough vaccine, or the baby had been vaccinated. He lived two hours away and I took a few weeks to get vaccinated... So by the time I saw her she'd already been vaccinated haha, but I totally respected it.", "OP stated the nephew is 7 months, October to November-ish. So yeah, right when RSV and literally every virus starts spreading like crazy because of holidays.", "Especially 7 months ago when the baby was born. I remember reading so much about baby\u2019s dying and being hospitalised because of it (also with the hospitals here not having the capacity to put the baby\u2019s on the mich needed support system because they\u2019ve put all the money into helping the elderly during Covid)", "The OP doesn\u2019t have to explain her boundary to anyone just like the SIL didn\u2019t have to explain hers. \n\nExplain it to you? I thought I\u2019ve explained it. \u201cWhat\u2019s good for the goose\u2026\u201d \n\nThe OP established a boundary similar to SIL\u2019s but not exactly the same. The more I think about this issue, the more I think I would\u2019ve done what OP did but for some possible different reasons. Maybe I would\u2019ve assumed SIL wouldn\u2019t want to \u201cintrude\u201d on a new family. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to ask her and put her in a possibly difficult position of declining the invitation. Maybe I would\u2019ve assumed that since SIL feit do strongly about a new family bonding by themselves for those first months, she would have thought less of me for not agreeing with her. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t seem to respecting OP\u2019s choice and boundary even though you would\u2019ve (it seems) made a different one.", "Yeah, she didn't give an explanation. So why can't op not give an explanation for why she doesn't want her brother and sil to meet her baby ?", "> Have you thought that maybe SIL knew her ILs are petty aholes so she didn't want to deal with a newborn, postpartum AND them?\n\nEntirely possible. Still doesn't entitle her to see someone else's kid. Why would she, if she hates them so much?", "Whooping cough is deadly to infants though so that's fine", "This is strongly recommended by pediatricians.  Our pediatrician has a poster about this in every exam room.", "> The OP established a boundary similar to SIL\u2019s\n\nthey aren't similar, they quite opposite in fact. SIL established her boundary as a means to give herself time to recover after (possibly difficult) birth. OP didn't even establish a general boundary, she just made a point of not inviting her SIL and her SIL only because she took SIL's boundary as a *personal attack* (when it clearly wasn't one). \n\n> Explain it to you? I thought I\u2019ve explained it. \n\nyou didn't? i still don't understand the logic behind punishing people for daring to have boundaries that you personally don't. asking to not be visited for a few months after birth isn't an insult (*unless* you are very explicitly the only person who isn't allowed to meet the baby, in which case it very well *could* be an insult), so why are you seeing it that way?", "Difference is one mother did it to make sure she and her baby would be safe (thus why no one met baby) while another used her baby as a prop to divide a family, bully another mother for her choices and make her SIL feel shamed for her incredibly valid choice. \n\nOP is nothing short of a bully. Or what else would you call someone who shuns just one person from a party?", ">Difference is one mother did it to make sure she and her baby would be safe (thus why no one met baby)\n\nWe don't know that. And even if it was the reason, why would she want to endanger somebody's else's baby?\n\n>Or what else would you call someone who shuns just one person from a party?\n\nNemesis."]}
