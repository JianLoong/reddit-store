I totally respected this. Brother didn't rly care about visitors either way but she specifically didn't want any visitors.

Yesterday I had a family dinner where my family came over and cooked for me and held the baby etc. Some people posted pics of this get together on social media. I DID NOT POST THEM! My sister in law saw these pics and was like I would love to meet the baby bla bla bla. She told my brother to ask why they weren't invited. Brother didn't really care he just asked on her behalf. I was like y'all can meet my baby after three months. Thank you for respecting my choice. You didn't want me to meet my nephew for three months, so you can meet your niece after three months. So now she posted a subtweet about me and I don't get why. She didn't let people meet her baby for three months so why should I let her meet mine?

It\u2019s known to help the health of the newborn to limit visitors, the child could have been suspected or known to have immune issues, they simply had preferences for their family. The reason you did it though? Sounds strongly like you dislike them and/or am using your child in a game of social revenge. Not a good look.

Newborns are cute and I like holding them, but they're much more fun to interact with when they're a little older. Newborns, you just stare at and sniff their baby-smell head and change a diaper.

I had been in a different room pumping (because I had to move my pump set up so my boobs weren't out and about with company) and when I came out I found them chit chatting it up with my husband and visiting friend while my baby was crying.
