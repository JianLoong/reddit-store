{"id": 27193, "submission_id": "16msj6r", "title": "AITA for telling my co-worker she should either lower her standards or stop complaining about being single?", "selftext": "One of my (27F) office mates, \u201cMarie\u201d 25F is struggling romantically. She\u2019s constantly complaining to some of our other office mates about how she can\u2019t find anyone, how she\u2019s destined to be alone, how men expect too much of her, etc. At first I empathized with her because early on I also struggled to find my person, but her daily rants got old fast. I don\u2019t choose to listen, but she\u2019s loud so I hear a lot. From what I hear, Marie HAS been on a few dates, but she has a set of standards for romantic partners:\n\nHe has to pay on the first date, but she won\u2019t tell him that. In fact she\u2019ll offer to split the bill but if he doesn\u2019t insist on paying there won\u2019t be a second date. He has to make six figures. (Marie does not make more than $60k a year.) He has to be above 6ft (Marie is 5\u20192.) He can\u2019t be bald/balding. He has to be fit and dedicated in the gym (Marie is overweight and never works out). He has to own a home and a car. He has to pay for everything and do all the cooking and split other chores evenly. The list goes on but you get the idea. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with having high standards, but I think it\u2019s hypocritical to hold men to standards you don\u2019t meet, and then complain and make it everyone else\u2019s problem. I think that at some point you have three options: either improve yourself to attract the type of people you want, lower your standards, or accept that dating is going to be hard for you and you\u2019re going to most likely wind up alone.\n\nI kept my mouth shut about this because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to give Marie advice, especially when I know she won\u2019t take it, but this past weekend my office mates and I all went out for drinks, and Marie got drunk and started the usual complaints. I stayed silent until she singled me out and told me I was so lucky to have my husband and things must be so easy for me. I was caught off guard because I wasn\u2019t used to being singled out like that. And I\u2019ll admit, I was a bit drunk myself. So I said that things weren\u2019t \u201ceasy\u201d for me\u2013that I had high standards too. The difference is, I also hold myself to a higher standard. I workout with my husband every day. My husband makes more money than me, but I reciprocate if he does something nice for me, not because he expects me to but because it\u2019s the right thing to do. I said if Marie wants a relationship she should stop living in a fantasy world and either improve HERSELF or lower her standards.\n\nMarie cried and stormed out of the bar with one of her closer friends. I effectively ended the get-together, as everyone went home. I felt a bit guilty until I got a lot of texts from various co-workers thanking me for \u201cputting Marie in her place\u201d and that they\u2019ve always wanted to say something but didn\u2019t have the balls. However, on Monday morning I was notified that someone had reported me to HR. I didn\u2019t have to read the full email to know who it was.

Our increasingly bad economy. It's hard to not see the appeal of that life even at the cost of subjugation when working hard will still yield you a small life and even if you work hard you won't get what your owed. You might deserve that promotion but its going to go to Deb who is woefully unqualified for it but is buds with the ceo.\nThe middle class lifestyle is a thing of the past so people often feel they only have 1 of 2 extremes.\n\n3.
