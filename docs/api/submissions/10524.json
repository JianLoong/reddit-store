I felt the closest to my mom so I asked her for the money, to which she sent me to ask my dad for. So i went to my dad and he sent me back to my mom. I told her that and she told me this is my dad's responsibility and refused to engage any further.\n\nSome background info here: my parents are gainfully employed and as far as I know, are not in any financial difficulties, but they are not on good terms and I had been told about two years back to get ready for a divorce and to pick who to have my custody, so I supposed this is yet another not-getting-along stuff that rebounded back to their kids. The divorce never came so the family's still in one piece (for now). \n\nAnyway I do not intend to ask anymore because it's too depressing and degrading (honestly this whole thing made me feel like a beggar), so the next day I paid for the school fees out of my monthly allowance and I'm not expecting to get it back from my parents.\n\nIt just so happened that we are required to write a journal entry for our free period that day, so I wrote about this whole fiasco. I must be more upset than I realised because I started tearing up while writing it.\n\nLater that day, my teacher approached me furiously and asked if what I wrote was true. I said yes, and she returned me the money and said she will pay for it first. Next thing I know was she called my mom to come to school, spoke to her in private and my mom paid up.\n\nAs we left the school together, my mom reprimanded me for telling on her to my teacher. She said I should not be telling outsiders about our family matters and that I caused an embarrassment. I said I don't think I was wrong because I did not lie and if she was in the right then why would she be embarrassed. She insisted I was wrong because what happens in the family stays within the family.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit 1: There may be a cause of false alarm that my teacher reads our journal entries. Please rest assure she\u2019s not breaking any rules.

NTA. Your parents have a RESPONSIBILITY, legally and morally, to pay for your feeds as required for your education. Thats part of having a child. If they cannot afford it, which they obviously can since your mom did immediately when called out, it seems that they were having a power struggle and putting you in the middle of it.  \n\n\nBoth of your parents are assholes for doing this to you. Your mom especially is an asshole for reprimanding you for telling the truth to your teacher. You SHOULD tell outsiders if there is any sort of abuse or neglect going on at home. \"What happens in the family stays within the family\" is how physical and sexual abuse isn't stopped over the long term. Their reaction screams to me neglect to force their CHILD to pay for their education fees.", "NTA. \n\nYour parents failed you. And you have every right to share what you want in that journal entry assignment.\n\nGood on your teacher for looking out for you. She is going beyond her duties for you.\n\nYour parents are acting like petulant kids. You're allowed to report them to the right authorities.", "Nta. That phrase about keeping things \"within the family\" is exactly how children are kept from speaking out btw. I'd hope this isn't a common phrase for when you're wronged.", "NTA\n\nIt's heart breaking that you felt more comfortable telling your teacher about your feelings than you did telling your parents.\n\nYou're a child, your parents should not be making you feel guilty for thier failures.", "NTA, and don\u2019t let your mother manipulate you into feeling guilty. \u201cIt\u2019s a family matter\u201d is code for \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed that other people know I\u2019ve been a bad parent and I\u2019m going to make it your problem instead of owning up to it.\u201d I do think it was inappropriate for the teacher to contact your mom on your behalf without consulting you first, though. By doing that, she put you in an awkward position, set you up for confrontation, and most importantly, took away your agency over how to handle the issue. This isn\u2019t a mandatory reporting issue.", "NTA You're a minor, they need to keep your needs on top of the list, if they don't fulfill their obligations you're in all your rights talking with an adult who is reliable, you're not alone.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry about your situation. Your parents are putting their pride and pettiness above your well being.", "NTA. You had no intention of telling your teacher and your teacher being a good person realized something was up. It\u2019s not like you intended for them to get in trouble. Both of your parents are TA.", "NTA, you were justified in your reaction. Your feelings are normal especially when faced with a situation that you couldn't control.\n\nYour teacher also did the right thing. She was right to reprimand your folks because they stuffed up bad, and put you in a corner. \n\nThe embarrassment is cause purely from your parents and not you. Don't believe what your mom is saying here", "NTA at all", "NTA. You did absolutely nothing wrong. She\u2019s embarrassed because she behaved like a child and got called out for it. You have no reason to be embarrassed. \n\nIf she continues to push it, and you feel comfortable enough, tell her how embarrassing it was to have to feel like a beggar with your own parents. I am so sorry this happened to you, and it\u2019s childish behavior that should never have happened, especially with you in the center. Please know you deserve more than this behavior.", "NTA. never be afraid to tell your teacher anything. there are there to help.", "NTA \n\nYour parents failed you!\n\nYou should be able to tell adults anything that happens at home.", "NTA your parents dropped the ball. you stepped up. you had feelings about it. you shared it in your journal.your teacher was concerned and cleared it up. That's between the adults. you were trying to do the right thing. They need to sort their issues out and not put them on you. Definitely read up about how to handle being put in the middle of a divorce. at this point sounds like you may end up being treated like a chew toy by being the go-between. you need to learn some skills to be able to step out of that go between position respectfully.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
