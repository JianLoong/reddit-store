Please let the divorce judge know about how your parents are treating you. Do not sugar coat it. Tell the truth.", "NTA. Your mom defienetly knows her and your dad are in the wrong. But on the other hand if she really believes this, than that's a major cause for concern and I'd get out of there as soon as I can. For example; A creepy uncle doing inapporiate things to you? Don't tell anyone, even the police, because it's a family matter and needs to stay in the family. That's not right. On the other hand, no cause for concern with the teacher reading the journal entry. I don't think many schools still do the journal entry assignments, or they're for younger grades, but they kind of have to read that stuff for assignment. No one said you had to include anything personal in those, but I'm glad you did. Your teacher sounds wonderful, like a good teacher who actually cares about her students. I wish there were more teachers like yours and less neglectful parents like yours.", "NTA and your mother should be embarrassed for placing you in this predicament.

You did nothing wrong. Stay strong.", "NTA tell your mom \"It wasn't a family matter, it was a school matter. My school fees weren't paid.\"", "NTA, your parents are the embarrassing ones.

You are 15, what are you supposed to do? I don't know what these school fees are, but you mention them casually as if they're a regular thing, so your parents should be aware of them. They put you in a position where you had to pay them out of their own pocket because they were being petty. Clearly from your account they're unhappy with each other, but its a free country, people get to stay in relationships that make them both miserable, they don't have the right to make you miserable because they're miserable.

She shouldn\u2019t have called your parents in. She can just pay out of the kindness of her heart if she\u2019s inclined. If she intends to call all the shitty parents of students to the carpet she\u2019s going to be a very busy person. As a school professional you just cannot do that. She\u2019d be better served to focus on supporting you and your needs so you can finish school. My mom never paid school fees either.
