I felt the closest to my mom so I asked her for the money, to which she sent me to ask my dad for. So i went to my dad and he sent me back to my mom. I told her that and she told me this is my dad's responsibility and refused to engage any further.\n\nSome background info here: my parents are gainfully employed and as far as I know, are not in any financial difficulties, but they are not on good terms and I had been told about two years back to get ready for a divorce and to pick who to have my custody, so I supposed this is yet another not-getting-along stuff that rebounded back to their kids. The divorce never came so the family's still in one piece (for now). \n\nAnyway I do not intend to ask anymore because it's too depressing and degrading (honestly this whole thing made me feel like a beggar), so the next day I paid for the school fees out of my monthly allowance and I'm not expecting to get it back from my parents.\n\nIt just so happened that we are required to write a journal entry for our free period that day, so I wrote about this whole fiasco. I must be more upset than I realised because I started tearing up while writing it.\n\nLater that day, my teacher approached me furiously and asked if what I wrote was true. I said yes, and she returned me the money and said she will pay for it first. Next thing I know was she called my mom to come to school, spoke to her in private and my mom paid up.\n\nAs we left the school together, my mom reprimanded me for telling on her to my teacher. She said I should not be telling outsiders about our family matters and that I caused an embarrassment. I said I don't think I was wrong because I did not lie and if she was in the right then why would she be embarrassed. She insisted I was wrong because what happens in the family stays within the family.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit 1: There may be a cause of false alarm that my teacher reads our journal entries. Please rest assure she\u2019s not breaking any rules. The journal writing is a class assignment and she is supposed to read it.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the kind responses, everyone. I've spoken to my mom and she clarified two points. 1 is that my dad is responsible for paying the school fees. He stopped paying to get to her and it worked, so she's very upset. 2, she is the main point of contact which was why the teacher called her. My dad is uninvolved in his kids' education - I missed an exam once and he never said anything about it, not even a reaction. We have reached a common understanding. She says she is very stressed out but will try to be a better mom. :( I still love my mom very much and will care for her always, but I'm not sure about my dad. I don't think he needs me.", "created_utc": 1676960273, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117wdsy/aita_for_telling_on_my_parents_to_my_teacher/", "score": 1899, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(This is coming from a 32 year old with two kids of her own.) ADULTS ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT! You are 100% right in this situation and you handled it yourself to the best of your ability. Great job navigating this situation.", "NTA.  I'm a former English teacher.  We regularly have students write journal entries.  We read them as a way to 1) make sure the students are fully understanding the lessons (many entries work off something covered in class) and 2) as a way to check in with how the student is doing overall).  One of my HS students wrote about being embarrassed that he couldn't afford better diapers for his daughter because the cheap ones were giving her a rash around her waist band and it made him feel like a bad parent even though he was going to school and working 30 hours a week.  I bought him a 100 pack of diapers.  My parents saw them and asked about them.  When I explained what was going on, my dad bought two more 100 packs of diapers and provided a $100 gift card and some socks (we were getting into a colder time of year).  My dad's card said \"From one (old) dad to another (young) dad.  I've been in your shoes. You're doing a great job!\"  I had the secretary call my student to the office and give him the diapers and card without tell him who they were from.  My student had tears in his eyes as he wrote about how much it meant to him to hear he was doing a great job.\n\nYour dad isn't doing a good job, much less a great one.  Your family isn't in one piece.  Your father won't file for the divorce because he has the best of both worlds.  He's seen as a good husband and father while contributing nothing and humiliating your mom.  She needs to file for the divorce and get everything reduced to a court order.  Every time your dad blows off his responsibilities, she needs to take him to court.\n\nTake heart.  Your mom wasn't really upset at you.  She was hurt and embarrassed by your father's behavior.  Give her a big hug from a former English teacher.  She's doing the best she can.", "I am so glad you have someone who cares and looks out for you! Sending internet stranger hugs your way."]}
