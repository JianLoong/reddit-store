The last time he was gone. He was out of country for 2 years. When he got back, I was in charge of packing up the house and relocating to his new duty station. While I was across the country handling the move, the kids were with him getting reacquainted. To get them to love him, he got them a dog. \n\nThe problem is, I am allergic to pet dander, as is my daughter. He knows this because he brought a dog home when I was pregnant as a surprise that put me in the hospital.  With medication, we can handle a hypoallergenic breed, and he knows this as well. He got a mutt from the pound. I am 100% on board with adopting vs breeders, which is why we don't have a dog. I also love animals. I will love on someone else's dog in a heartbeat, and suffer for a while while scarring down benadryl. We had a conversation when I got home, and he made me feel like a monster bc the kids loved it. But we are miserable. My daughter and I are forced to take allergy medicine every day, her asthma has gotten worse and our eczema is out of control. \n\nWhile rubbing cortisone cream on my daughter's legs and back yesterday I just snapped and told him that if he didn't find it a new home, we are leaving.

He didn't think about them at all.", "NTA. I love animals probably beyond reason and am very much a knee-jerk \"of course Y T A\" whenever I read the topic on a post like this, but... you and your daughter both are having medical reactions to this. And you're even on board with having a dog, just one that's not as likely to set off your issues. Add in the whole \"buying the kids' love\" angle and just... yeah.\n\nAs much as I feel for the kids, you and your daughter are both physically suffering. Find it a good home (rather than just taking it to the pound) and I'd call it good. My other thought is to promise the kids another dog from a hypoallergenic breed to help but... a) it feels like it's making dogs just interchangeable rather than family members and b) even those I believe can still cause allergy issues so it'd really suck for the kids if the second dog then also had to be rehomed. Still might be something to keep in mind for the near future but without the whole \"okay we're just going to replace this dog so it's okay\" lead-in.", "NTA the dog is making you both physically sick and he can't expect you to be happy to live like that. He should have discussed a pet with the whole family before getting one, rather than just acting like he's some sort of great  dad", "Nta .\n\nI'm so sorry! \nBut there's a Million things he can do top Marke the kids live him and getting an animal isn't it!\n\nThis is so weird. Who's going to take care of the poor pub when he's gone again?\n\nPlease talk to him again, there's something wrong with his reasoning.", "NTA and why is your husband always bringing home pets without consulting you? That is a huge red flag. He\u2019s a total asshole for getting pets that he knows he won\u2019t be responsible for and you\u2019re allergic to. Absolutely insane behavior. Live divorcible behavior", "NTA. Huge animal lover here, too. I am allergic to cats, but I have 3. I am now used to their dander, but I still take Benadryl every night. It's the sacrifice I am willing to make. But if I didn't want them and my husband brought one home I would be *livid.* He is an AH for knowingly making you and your daughter suffer needlessly to assuage his own guilt.", "NTA. Under most circumstances this kind of ultimatum would be an asshole thing to do, but you said it yourself: you can't breathe. Worse, though, is that your husband knew this would happen, because he has done it before and it ended with you in the hospital.\n\nPets become a beloved part of the family, but perspective is a thing. You can't have a dog.", "NTA. He got the dog as an easy way out. rehome the dog, preferably with someone you know instead of the pound. That's so tough, and I'm so sorry you're going through that.", "NTA and you won't be able to live in the home comfortably for months, either. See if you can get moved to new housing on base if that's where you are. He deliberately put your health and your daughter's health at risk in an attempt to buy their love. Heck, not even \"at risk\" but deliberately made you very ill.  I feel bad for the dog but rehome it immediately and point the finger right at him when they ask why. He brought home something toxic to your daughter and to you. He COULD have gotten a different pet, there are dozens out there, but I guess a dog was easiest to get. NTA in the slightest. He knew you were HIGHLY allergic; Eczema, for crying out loud! Poor kids, poor you, poor dog, and it's all on his shoulders for making a very AH decision.", "Husband is an asshole.   As much as I love dogs my family's health trumps everything.  Stick to your guns on this.   Find the dog a home.   If having a dog is unavoidable maybe you can substitute a ferret.", "I'd say NTA as a dog lover myself. So he just surprise brought the dog home without consulting you at all? When he knows you are allergic? You and your kids' health should be a priority over adopting any animal- you said it yourself, your child's asthma is worse and you can't breathe! And by rehoming the dog, you can make sure it still has a loving home to stay in instead of going back to a shelter.", "NTA, your husband shouldn\u2019t have adopted a dog without asking you, especially since he knew you were allergic to pet dander. It\u2019s also not fair to get an animal and then essentially force other people to take care of it, since he\u2019s gone all the time. While in an ideal situation a dog should never be rehomed, your husband created a super unideal situation for everyone. Rehoming is the best option imo, given half the people in the house are miserable. You\u2019re a compassionate person and I\u2019m sure will do right by the animal and find it a good home, honestly that should be your husband\u2019s responsibility but it remains to be seen if he has the time or compassion to do it. Tough situation, but you have to do what\u2019s best for you and your kids.", "Nta I would just leave allergies like that are so bad I can relate I\u2019m allergic to Guinea pigs it sent me to urgent care I could not breathe. And I tried to endure it but it got so bad I had to give them to my mil and what\u2019s worse I had Guinea pigs prior like 5-7 years ago.", "NTA. Your daughter is more important than a pet. Her asthma is worsening, so you must rehome the dog. (Not to mention your own health is affected by the dog). Please be aware, there is no such thing as a \u201chypoallergenic\u201d breed. Yes, some dogs may affect you less, but you are setting your family up for more heartbreak if you bring home another dog that still causes health problems. For instance, the dog\u2019s saliva is still allergenic. This happened to a friend of mine. Her daughter had a horrible allergic reaction to a supposedly \u201chypoallergenic\u201d dog they brought home. They were all sad to have to give it up, but it needed to be done.", "\"But I like the dog! What's it matter if my wife can't breathe properly and my daughter is miserable, as long as I'm happy?\"\n\nFather of the year right there. NTA.", "Your husband is putting HIS DAUGHTER'S LIFE IN DANGER and there is even a discussion??? Allergies are no freaking joke. ALLERGIES KILL PEOPLE. Full stop. No more need be said. Our immune systems are supposed to protect us, but when they go insane because of allergies, they then go from protecting us to killing us. NTA a million times NTA!!!", "NTA.  Re-home the dog.  He didn\u2019t discuss it with you and didn\u2019t even consider that he\u2019s deployed all the time.  He\u2019ll never have to deal with taking care of it.", "NTA  What your husband did, knowing that you and your daughter are highly allergic to pet dander, was wrong on so many levels, and extremely cruel to do to a dog.  Dogs don't have the ability to reason, as humans do, so it's especially hard on them in being forced to leave home....they don't understand what they've done wrong.  \n\nCould it be your husband is having mood or anxiety issues from being overseas that might have affected his thought processes?  I believe you do love animals, and I hope you can be part of finding a new, loving and trustworthy home for the sake of the dog.  I wouldn't want to see that task be in the hands of your husband, because his ability to put the best interest of others in the forefront seems a bit lagging.\n\nAlso, there IS a compromise and using a reputable breeder in order to obtain a certain breed of dog for legitimate reasons is NOT a bad thing.  In your case, getting one of the breeds that allergy sufferers can have is not doing anything wrong against dogs up for adoption!  The bad reputation comes from the backyard breeders, who don't know a thing about breeding in a professional and responsible manner.  They only want to make money selling puppies, healthy or not.", "NTA\n\nBecause nothing says \u201cdaddy loves you\u201d like making you suffer through asthma and eczema!", "How long have you had the dog?", "Asthma is a serious medical condition and can be very dangerous if not controlled. NTA!", "Have you talked to a doctor? \n\nWhen my sister was a kid she really wanted a dog.  She wanted a specific breed that does shed and cause allergies. She went to the doctor and got shots every two weeks so she could have a dog.   It worked great.  That was over 40 years ago so I am sure medication has improved.  \n\nI would try that but it also sounds like you don\u2019t like dog hair. \n\nNTA. \n\nAlso getting a dog so your kids love you is totally wrong.", "INFO: Have you tried shampoo specific for allergies?

I love dogs, waited my whole childhood to get my own because my dad hates dogs.  Had a wonderful dog for 14 wonderful years.  In those years, I met my husband.  He's allergic to dogs.  When my baby passed, guess who didn't get a dog to replace him, even though I'm home a lot and love dogs.  People before animals.

And that if I don\u2019t do what I need to do to keep the asthma under control so that it doesn\u2019t damage my lungs, I will eventually get emphysema from the accumulation of damage and need constant oxygen by the time I hit my 60s\u2026\n\nSo, this is an untenable situation that will affect the long term health of your daughter.  I am guessing that your husband doesn\u2019t realize that.  You should have a conversation with your daughter\u2019s asthma doc.  If the doc doesn\u2019t specialize is asthma, then go see one that does to explain what happens to a person who doesn\u2019t avoid their asthma triggers\u2026\n\nThe other thing is that allergies is that if they are constantly triggered, the reactions can become worse or be more difficult to resolve.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about being mean, this is about the long term health of you and your daughter.", "NTA - Rehome the dog and I\u2019m saying this as a *huge* dog lover.

Then you would be ok with a hypo dog.  But not from a breeder.  But you are ok with other peoples dogs.  But the closing issue is dog hair everywhere.  And you and one child will leave as a result?  And you attribute ill motives to your spouse around getting the dog. \n\nFocus and don\u2019t undermine your own needs.  Your concern is your health.\n\nFocus on a solution.  Talk to your spouse about developing a reasonable path forward that considers the interests of the dog AND the very legitimate health interests of you and your family.
