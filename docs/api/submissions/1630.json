I love animals probably beyond reason and am very much a knee-jerk \"of course Y T A\" whenever I read the topic on a post like this, but... you and your daughter both are having medical reactions to this. And you're even on board with having a dog, just one that's not as likely to set off your issues. Add in the whole \"buying the kids' love\" angle and just... yeah.\n\nAs much as I feel for the kids, you and your daughter are both physically suffering. Find it a good home (rather than just taking it to the pound) and I'd call it good. My other thought is to promise the kids another dog from a hypoallergenic breed to help but... a) it feels like it's making dogs just interchangeable rather than family members and b) even those I believe can still cause allergy issues so it'd really suck for the kids if the second dog then also had to be rehomed. Still might be something to keep in mind for the near future but without the whole \"okay we're just going to replace this dog so it's okay\" lead-in.", "NTA the dog is making you both physically sick and he can't expect you to be happy to live like that.

Live divorcible behavior", "NTA. Huge animal lover here, too. I am allergic to cats, but I have 3. I am now used to their dander, but I still take Benadryl every night. It's the sacrifice I am willing to make.

He brought home something toxic to your daughter and to you. He COULD have gotten a different pet, there are dozens out there, but I guess a dog was easiest to get. NTA in the slightest.

When he knows you are allergic? You and your kids' health should be a priority over adopting any animal- you said it yourself, your child's asthma is worse and you can't breathe! And by rehoming the dog, you can make sure it still has a loving home to stay in instead of going back to a shelter.", "NTA, your husband shouldn\u2019t have adopted a dog without asking you, especially since he knew you were allergic to pet dander. It\u2019s also not fair to get an animal and then essentially force other people to take care of it, since he\u2019s gone all the time. While in an ideal situation a dog should never be rehomed, your husband created a super unideal situation for everyone. Rehoming is the best option imo, given half the people in the house are miserable. You\u2019re a compassionate person and I\u2019m sure will do right by the animal and find it a good home, honestly that should be your husband\u2019s responsibility but it remains to be seen if he has the time or compassion to do it.

Yes, some dogs may affect you less, but you are setting your family up for more heartbreak if you bring home another dog that still causes health problems. For instance, the dog\u2019s saliva is still allergenic. This happened to a friend of mine. Her daughter had a horrible allergic reaction to a supposedly \u201chypoallergenic\u201d dog they brought home.

He didn\u2019t discuss it with you and didn\u2019t even consider that he\u2019s deployed all the time.  He\u2019ll never have to deal with taking care of it.", "NTA  What your husband did, knowing that you and your daughter are highly allergic to pet dander, was wrong on so many levels, and extremely cruel to do to a dog.  Dogs don't have the ability to reason, as humans do, so it's especially hard on them in being forced to leave home....they don't understand what they've done wrong.  \n\nCould it be your husband is having mood or anxiety issues from being overseas that might have affected his thought processes?  I believe you do love animals, and I hope you can be part of finding a new, loving and trustworthy home for the sake of the dog.  I wouldn't want to see that task be in the hands of your husband, because his ability to put the best interest of others in the forefront seems a bit lagging.\n\nAlso, there IS a compromise and using a reputable breeder in order to obtain a certain breed of dog for legitimate reasons is NOT a bad thing.  In your case, getting one of the breeds that allergy sufferers can have is not doing anything wrong against dogs up for adoption!  The bad reputation comes from the backyard breeders, who don't know a thing about breeding in a professional and responsible manner.  They only want to make money selling puppies, healthy or not.", "NTA\n\nBecause nothing says \u201cdaddy loves you\u201d like making you suffer through asthma and eczema!", "How long have you had the dog?", "Asthma is a serious medical condition and can be very dangerous if not controlled.

That was over 40 years ago so I am sure medication has improved.  \n\nI would try that but it also sounds like you don\u2019t like dog hair. \n\nNTA. \n\nAlso getting a dog so your kids love you is totally wrong.", "INFO: Have you tried shampoo specific for allergies?
