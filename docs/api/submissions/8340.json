I read her bio and she claimed she was in search for her relatives on her unknown biological father's side. She also claimed that the only the thing she knew of him was that he left when she just a baby. My mom had no idea who this woman was, and that left me with one person; my dad.\n\nI connected with the woman's profile and we started talking, trying to figure how we're related. I asked her how old she is, and she responded that she's 28, only 2 years older than me. I also asked about her dad, and if she had any pictures of him. Turns out her mom did and, what do you know, it's my dad. I was pissed off that my dad would keep something like this from me. We're supposed to be an honest, close-knit family, but not telling us that you left your infant child without ever talking to them again and your former lover to parent them all alone isn't honest.\n\nI lost my shit on my dad over this and he denies that he has had any other children with another women. He even sweared on his life that he wasn't lying, but I sent him the picture my half-sister sent me with our dad, and he went on about how that could've been anyone else. It was clearly him, and he was trying to play me down like I'm dumb. That's when I tolf him that I'm done trusting him and that I might even cut ties with him. Knowing my dad is a POS deadbeat is one thing, but flat out laying to me about it is another thing. It turns out mom didn't even know about this.\n\nMy mom said, \"I think it's messed up he did that and never told us, but that was years ago and you're overreacting.\" Years ago, sure, but he completely ignored her existence for many more years and started a new family with another woman.

Maybe he made this mistake years ago, but lying and attempting to gaslight you into believing that he couldn't possibly be the father is a pretty recent occurrence.  I would have been more inclined to suggest that you forgive him if he'd been somewhat regretful and apologetic.  Instead he doubled down.", "NTA\n\nI had something really similar happen to me too, and what little trust I had of this parent was completely gone when I found this out.\n\nThe fact that your dad continued to lie with the picture and DNA proof being brought to him is egotistical, and I do not blame you for feeling the way you do. Your mom also had an odd way of reacting to this development.", "Wait, did you get pictures of your half sister with you dad? Or was it a picture of her mother with your dad?", "NTA - It\u2019s funny how DNA doesn\u2019t lie, but people still try to. Your dad is an asshole and I have a feeling your mom might\u2019ve known about your sister, hence her reaction. Take space, this kind of stuff isn\u2019t easy.", "NTA. I'm on your side here. He abandoned a kid! That's a huge deal. And when confronted, he continued to lie. \n\nUnless your dad has an identical twin he doesn't know about, it's his kid.", "NTA...It must be a horrible feeling as his child to know that he could so easily leave a child behind and not care for her.  I hope both you and your half sister are able to find a positive way forward.  Your father needs to start being honest.", "NTA But why is the mom down playing this", "NTA. As his children it must be super subversive because that means he can have a child, know he has a child, and still lie about the child and deny it\u2019s existence. Like I would think \u201ccould he have done this to me?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be able to trust him either and I don\u2019t understand how your mom can.", "NTA. It might have been \"years ago\" for them, but this is new information. And how they are handling it just makes them look worse for being ok with abandoning a child.", "NTA The DNA led you right to each other. Your dad's a liar.", "NTA\nUnless your dad has a secret identical twin brother, he\u2019s pretty much caught and should own up to it. Not just for you and your mother, but for the other child he ditched.", "NTA\n\nBeing a liar and a deadbeat tends to tarnish your reputation. Even more when you preach about being a close knit family.", "NTA. You deserve truthfulness in your closest relationships. Your mom will need to come to terms with this on her own time, in her own way. Do what you need to do to look after your own heart and mind after learning this mind-bending truth.", "Info: was it a picture of your dad with the baby or a picture of your dad with the other woman or just your dad?\n\nIf it's the first, NTA, then he's a lying AH and it's understandable that you don't trust him anymore.\n\nBut if it's not, especially if it's just a picture of your father, I'd inquire about the mom first. Maybe she didn't tell him that she was pregnant and he honestly didn't know. Then still NTA, this is a lot to digest and a pretty hard thing to find out, so your reaction is still relatable, but then he's maybe not an AH either.\n\nIf it's just a foto of him with the wife or him alone, I'd do the following. Sit down with him in a quiet moment and willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Ask him to just listen to you, then calmly and without accusations I'd present your case, what happened, what you found out and what you have so far without running to conclusions. Then tell him that by the DNA analysis it's very doubtful that this woman is not his child, but you're willing to hear him out. Then listen.\n\n\nYou alone know your father, and what kind of man he is. Was he a good father? Did he care for you, your siblings and your mom? Is he otherwise a good person? Did this really surprise you and you'd never expected to find something like that?\n\nIf yes, you should give him some grace. People do stupid things when they're young. And maybe he really didn't know she was pregnant, or maybe she had several guys or cheated on him and he honestly thought it wasn't his child. Maybe it was a one time affair he deeply regretted all the time.\n\nIf he cheated on your mom that's bad. But it's still her decision how to deal with it. What's more important is the question if he knew he was a dad and how it happened that he abandoned a child. \n\nI'd allow him one more time to explain himself in a calm moment without accusations.\n\nThen I'd make my final verdict.\n\nAnother question, how old are your siblings? And how long have your parents been married before you were born?", "NTA. If this is true, I\u2019d see him with completely new eyes. He\u2019s lied to you, your mom and your siblings for your whole life. And yes, he\u2019s abandoned a child.", "NTA. That' a Grand Canyon level breach of trust.", "NTA\n\nYour comment said the pic was of him with the baby, so he obviously knew.\n\nHe's had 28 years of knowledge and has done nothing for her the whole time. Every time he would have remembered her over the years, he made the decision to do nothing. Every time, he chose to neglect her and continue hiding her from your family. \n\nIt's not 'in the past' at all. \n\nHis denial in the face of everything was a current AH move on his part. So you are judging him on recent actions.", "He cheated your mother, lied for decades, deprived you of having a half-sister, was a deadbeat dad and when you confronted he made it seem like you were inventing things?\n\nMany mothers pretend they don't know their marital affairs because they don't want any trouble with child support. So your mother might be in it too.\n\nNTA", "NAH. Unless the picture is of him with the baby half sister theres not enough here to prove him a liar.", "YTA\n\nI believe you are jumping to conclusions based on information you do not have. It is actually not uncommon for a man to have children they do not know about. Your half-sister's version of the story is that he \"left\" when she was a baby, and yes that does happen, but it is also common that the father simply was never in the picture in the first place and the pregnancy was unintended (whether the father knew about it or not).\n\nFor this reason I believe your reaction is overblown. It's a mystery, not a scandal. \\[Edit:\\] From the end your story you establish that your father was not in a relationship with your mother at the time. I would add that... I think it's highly unlikely that most single mothers of children who were born from one-night-stands with anonymous men would actually tell their children that, ever.", "YTA....did it ever occur to you that he didn't know?
