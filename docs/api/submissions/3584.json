I'm happy to buy tea or coffee, a sandwich or hot food for someone who needs it, but the last time I offered I just got told he wanted the money instead and he was so rude, I felt embarrassed and just wanted to help since it was so cold outside.

Should one give to homeless people generally? I say yes. We live in a world in which people need money to live. Its quite expensive being homeless. You cant take advantage of grocery sales if you have to carry everything you buy. You have to buy mostly cooked/processed foods since you dont have a stove or fridge.

If you want people to help you, do not be entitled, do not aggravate them. If that man had wanted something, he should have asked instead of immediately assuming you were an elitist b\\*\\*\\*\\*. Had he calmly asked for change, and asked if it was true you bought coffee/pie for people, you could have calmly explained that you couldn't today, but that you may be able to help some other time.
