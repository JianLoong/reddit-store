If I have a spare couple of dollars, I will generally offer to buy someone a cup of coffee or a hot pie from the convenience shop in the train station. Especially around Christmas, I really try and help people out as I am sure that their bit in life is not easy.\n\nWhile I do not do this every day, it is a pretty normal thing for me and I have gotten to semi-know the people sleeping rough in the train station where I get on on the way to work.\n\nToday, though, I saw a man (30s-40s) I had never seen before sitting with one of the ladies I have seen quite often, but he came and stood on the platform while everyone on their daily commute were waiting for the train to arrive.\n\nHe began asking for change, and I wasn't paying too much attention, but I don't think many (if any) people gave him anything. By the time he got to me, he asked for change and I shook my head no. I didn't have any cash and a cup of coffee wasn't in my budget today as I have some big bills coming up this month.\n\nThe man proceeded to rip my headphones out of my ears and tell me that I was a elitist not-nice-word-to-call-a-woman (not sure if I am allowed to swear on this sub), and that his friend had told him I would give him some change but that I probably only gave change to women. He said that people like me were the reason he couldn't get back on his feet, and that I probably stole food out of the mouthes of male children.\n\nMy eyes were like saucers the entire time - I was in such shock. It was at this point that another commuter (M30s-40s) stepped in basically told the homeless man to leave me alone and that he wasn't entitled to anyone's change. The homeless man left, but not before throwing his bottle of water at me (thankfully I was not hit or wet in any way).\n\nI thanked the other commuter, but have not been able to get the homeless man's words out of my mind. I try and be generous when I can, and I feel like I could have probably spared him a couple of dollars.\n\nI spoke to a colleague (F29) about it, and she said that we never know people's stories and should be as compassionate as possible. She said that we don't know what kind of night he had, and a little bit of kindness always goes a long way.\n\nI felt worse after speaking to her, and now I wonder if I did behave terribly towards that man.

He's the c\\*\\*t.", "NTA - I'm also a fan of giving when I can, usually in the form of food since my friend who works for an organization working to end homelessness also agrees giving money is not helpful in the long run.\n\nBut there are times when it doesn't work for me for whatever reason, and I don't see this type of giving in such a random way (based almost wholly on proximity and opportunity) ever as a moral obligation.\n\nSo you were NTA to start with, and then on top of it this guy feels entitled to assault you (maybe minor with a swipe at the headphones and a toss of a water bottle, but all the same), insult you, harass you, which pretty much no matter what happened before or after makes him T.A.\n\nAnd as an aside, I was once walking through a subway station and a man straight up spit on my face as he walked by. He looked like he might be homeless but he didn't ask me (or anyone as far as I could tell) for money, he just spit on me completely out of nowhere.

Never let anyone see where you pull your money from.\n\nAlso, he was violent so you did the right thing. Your coworker obviously didn\u2019t know what she was talking about if she heard that story and thought you should still give the man money or if she was trying to excuse his behavior.", "NTA. You give when you can. This time you couldn't. Don't let what that AH said bother you. Btw.. just because they're homeless doesn't mean they can't be AH's.", "NTA\n\nSome of them are drugs and alcohol infuse rage.\n\nHe assaulted you when you politely said no.

It's very kind of you to give spare change/food/drinks to people who need it, but it's not required of you. Your friend said you don't know their situation, the man who demanded money from you didn't know *your* situation either. What an awful thing to do! \n\nI try to help too, but I don't give money. I'm happy to buy tea or coffee, a sandwich or hot food for someone who needs it, but the last time I offered I just got told he wanted the money instead and he was so rude, I felt embarrassed and just wanted to help since it was so cold outside. Another guy i offered to buy food for just asked if I could buy some tinned dog food for his little dog instead, so I bought both for him\n\nYou Absolutely did not deserve that. Even if you did have spare change, he is not entitled to it in any way. \n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "I've spoken with people who have various types direct knowledge of honelessness - cops, social workers, people who were homeless themselves.

Also: big NTA.", "NTA in anyway \n\nWhile it's true that we never know what people go through,  that homeless man tried to physically and sexually harrased you because you're a young woman.

Your doing the right thing in being compassionate and trying to help when you can. But you had no cash and he\u2019s not entitled to your money.

Its pretty clear who was acting like an AH that day. His behavior is inexcusable. I know many homeless folks, they would not behave this way nor condone this behavior among themselves. Should one give to homeless people generally? I say yes. We live in a world in which people need money to live. Its quite expensive being homeless. You cant take advantage of grocery sales if you have to carry everything you buy. You have to buy mostly cooked/processed foods since you dont have a stove or fridge. And if I had to live under a bridge in the cold and rain with cops waking me up in the night telling me to leave and being banned from stores because they think you are the guy that stole from them last week, I'd probably drink every day, and so would you. \n\nBless you for what you have given, and dont let this bad encounter put you off from helping your fellow humans in the future.", "NTA.

If you want people to help you, do not be entitled, do not aggravate them. If that man had wanted something, he should have asked instead of immediately assuming you were an elitist b\\*\\*\\*\\*. Had he calmly asked for change, and asked if it was true you bought coffee/pie for people, you could have calmly explained that you couldn't today, but that you may be able to help some other time. The man needs to accept this and bid you farewell. When people are calm and don't let small matters out of their control bother them, they can typically end up gaining more from others.
