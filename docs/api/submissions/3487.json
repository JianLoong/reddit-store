{"id": 3487, "submission_id": "z7gzeb", "title": "AITA For not helping a former friend and her 7-year-old daughter in need over that friend\u2019s relationship with my brother?", "selftext": "I had a childhood friend \u201cEmily\u201d and also my brother \u201cJames.\u201d James made my life hell. Growing up, he would demean me, destroy my things, and start rumors about me at school so others would avoid and bully me. Emily directly witnessed how miserable James made me. However, as adults, Emily and James started dating. Despite James never apologizing for and continuing his behavior, Emily tried telling me to just forget/ignore the awful way James treated me because they were in love and it was making things uncomfortable. My parents tried to say the same things. (My parents are the type of people who just push everyone to get along instead of trying to address why people weren\u2019t getting along in the first place.) I distanced myself and moved on with my life without them. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost a decade since then. I didn\u2019t think about Emily or James unless they were brought up by someone else. Emily reached out to me a few weeks ago through my work email. Emily explained that she and James were divorcing because of his behavior. James was sleeping around with multiple other women. He refused to financially contribute to their household and wouldn\u2019t help with my 7-year-old niece \u201cRose\u201d because he considered being a father as \u201cbabysitting\u201d on his days off. Emily was asking if she could temporarily move in with me and my family or provide childcare for Rose while she figured things out because we were \u201cpractically sisters growing up.\u201d I told Emily no. What happened to us being \u201cpractically sisters\u201d when she dated and told me to forgive/tolerate a person who she witnessed actively make me miserable? James shouldn\u2019t behave that way toward her or Rose. But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that she only reached out to me because she\u2019s now on the receiving end of his behavior.\n\nMy family pointed out that if Emily continued to be benefitted/unaffected by James\u2019s behavior, she would have never reached out to me. Also that Emily\u2019s parents are still alive, so she can go to them for help. But my friend \u201cMary\u201d said she couldn\u2019t believe our attitude and lack of empathy toward Emily and Rose. Because when you\u2019re blinded by love, you can\u2019t see a person\u2019s flaws clearly and Rose is completely innocent. I still believe that Emily is not entitled to my help and Rose is not my responsibility either. But now my mother-in-law and sister-in-law are saying similar things and that as a mother myself, I should have more empathy for Rose and put forth more of an effort to help my niece.
