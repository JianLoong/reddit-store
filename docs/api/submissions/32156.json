He's going to need to keep that backbone nice and strong because his mother is going to be a serious pain in the ass. (Sorry)\n\nIn terms of the ask, totally reasonable. Aside from any other consideration, all the gross stuff that they touch in the gym is more than enough reason for you to want them to change first.  \n\nSeveral of the other commenters have talked about her being \"uncomfortable\" with your \"restrictions,\" which she can fuck right off with that BS, by the way.  \ud83d\ude01 But I want to call attention to her calling you ignorant because of your concern. That level of disrespect is WAY off the chart. This is YOUR child. Even if you were spouting something that was actually ignorant, it would still be disrespectful to confront you about it that way. Worse yet, she is so confident in her position that she called you out even though she is actually wrong. \n\nYour husband is going to need to have a talk with his parents, in private, and lay down the law here. If he doesn't, this problem is only going to get worse. Best wishes for all three of you.", "NTA because it's your kid and you handled it well by having your husband bring it up and not being a jerk about it.\n\nIt is really unlikely to be an issue, though. It's more likely that they would become carriers or ill themselves and share it that way. Of course you know that can happen anywhere and is an excellent reason to limit outsider  (different households) contact and carefully choose where you take baby and how you introduce her immune system to the world.\n\nYour husband should tell his mother that calling you ignorant is way over the line, borderline cruel for a new mother, and you three will be enjoying a few weeks away from them to recover from the hurt feelings and to reinforce that you two set the boundaries and their comfort is only as relevant as you decide it is. This may sound harsh but he gently corrected them and she insulted you. She's the asshole.", "NTA at all.

I agree with you MIL about your ignorance. A bit of sweat is not going to make your baby get sick. The reason sweat starts to stink if you don't shower in a reasonable amount of time is that the bacteria that colonize your skin (and that's on everyone's skin, even yours, and that is not a bad thing) start to break down the compounds in the sweat and release the stink byproducts. \n\nIn fact, exposing your baby to normal environments,  where bacteria colonize everything, is GOOD for their developing immune systems. Multiple studies have shown that children growing up in overly sterile environments get more colds, flu, and immune problems like allergies. Relax. Your in-laws managed to raise your husband without killing him.", "k MIL is right, the baby isnt gonna get sick from their sweat. What are you gonna do about school and day care?

Great thing about skin is it is easy to wash.", "Honestly, YTA.  As long as you\u2019re breastfeeding, you\u2019re providing a lot of immune-boosting compounds, but if you treat your child like they need to live in a bubble for their safety, you\u2019re actually jeapodizing healthy immune development in the child, and increasing the likelihood of autoimmune disorders on top of it.  Don\u2019t let them eat poop or have contact with sick people, but otherwise loosen up!  They\u2019re in the world now, and a little sweat won\u2019t hurt anyone.", "What's with all these grandparents getting their panties in a wad about rules or requests in regards to their baby grandchildren? \n\n\"Well when you were a baby, I didn't do [insert parents' request here] and you turned out just fine!\"  \n\nCongrats!

Just stand your ground- nobody can hold baby unless they are clean. No exceptions, except in case of emergency. It\u2019s a boundary, not a punishment.
