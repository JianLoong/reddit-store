The reason sweat starts to stink if you don't shower in a reasonable amount of time is that the bacteria that colonize your skin (and that's on everyone's skin, even yours, and that is not a bad thing) start to break down the compounds in the sweat and release the stink byproducts. \n\nIn fact, exposing your baby to normal environments,  where bacteria colonize everything, is GOOD for their developing immune systems.

Just stand your ground- nobody can hold baby unless they are clean. No exceptions, except in case of emergency. It\u2019s a boundary, not a punishment.

Most gyms have showering facilities, so they wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to go home in order to clean up and change.\n\nIf they\u2019ve got symptoms of illness like cough, body aches, fever, or have been in crowded environments in the past 24-48 hours, they should keep their distance\u2014call or FaceTime rather than visiting.\n\nWhile I personally think the risk of baby getting sick as a result of the grandparents having been in contact with gym equipment that\u2019s been touched by other people is low (the contact points would generally be hands and seat; they can mitigate the hands by hand washing, and baby is highly unlikely to be in contact with their butt), you aren\u2019t being unreasonable to ask them to come over in clean, dry clothes.\n\nGlad your husband is with you on the issue!
