The reason sweat starts to stink if you don't shower in a reasonable amount of time is that the bacteria that colonize your skin (and that's on everyone's skin, even yours, and that is not a bad thing) start to break down the compounds in the sweat and release the stink byproducts. \n\nIn fact, exposing your baby to normal environments,  where bacteria colonize everything, is GOOD for their developing immune systems.

Just stand your ground- nobody can hold baby unless they are clean. No exceptions, except in case of emergency. It\u2019s a boundary, not a punishment.

Most gyms have showering facilities, so they wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to go home in order to clean up and change.\n\nIf they\u2019ve got symptoms of illness like cough, body aches, fever, or have been in crowded environments in the past 24-48 hours, they should keep their distance\u2014call or FaceTime rather than visiting.\n\nWhile I personally think the risk of baby getting sick as a result of the grandparents having been in contact with gym equipment that\u2019s been touched by other people is low (the contact points would generally be hands and seat; they can mitigate the hands by hand washing, and baby is highly unlikely to be in contact with their butt), you aren\u2019t being unreasonable to ask them to come over in clean, dry clothes.\n\nGlad your husband is with you on the issue!

Germs don\u2019t transfer well from clothing.", "But you can\u2019t explain why.\n\nThe reality is that some exposure to the outside world is good for babies and not having a relationship with its grandparents is far more dangerous than exposure to sweat. \n\nHuman babies have encountered sweat for millions of years and I bet the grandparents here were not exactly dripping in it.", "nope whole family goes. outside of New orleans it is just a big street party. Took her camping when she was 6 weeks old. You dont expose them to germs, they dont build up any immunity and you are gonna have  a sick kid all the time. 5 kids. no allergies or chronic illnesses", "Something I picked up in hospitality work that I've never forgotten: Anything people touch with their hands on a regular basis is *disgustingly* dirty. \n\nLike let's not forget when covid happened, and governments across the world actually had to educate grown adults on how to wash their hands after using the toilet, because people weren't already doing it.", "Staph, especially MRSA, was my first thought, too! I also know someone who got HPV in his eye from touching equipment at the gym he worked at. In his eye!!", "I would expect people to be washing their hands after any venture outdoors, basically, and definitely before holding a new baby. Even if they hadn't been to a gym.", "You should wash your hands after shopping at IKEA, too, yes.", "I wouldn't want someone to hold my 2 week old baby when they came straight from Ikea either. But I do think people probably rub themselves on things more at the gym than at Ikea.", "You don\u2019t lie or sit on things at IKEA that hundreds of other people have sat and lain on before you though. Especially not sweaty people, and certainly not with their feet like at the gym.", "Id say the gym is a bit different since people are sweating and exerting themselves, more often touching lots of knobs or things meant to adjust equipment. People sit at IKEA, pick stuff up here and there, but gyms require a lot more fiddling and fluids \n\nPeople are also often drinking water or mixed supplements, sometimes wiping their mouth on their hand", "Even a very tiny exposure could be harmful for an infant. \n\nAlso, doesn't change the fact that it's mom's rules that matter, not what the in-laws think the rules should be.", "There\u2019s a reason pediatricians recommend not taking an infant out in public for the first 3 months. \n\nGyms are dirty. That\u2019s not just regular germs. People go to the gym with Covid as well as other shit. Gyms have caused people to get staph, ring worm, plantar warts, impetigo, MRSA, etc.", ">Anything people touch with their hands on a regular basis is *disgustingly* dirty. \n\nI tell my kids to wash their hands because they touch things that other people touch, and you don't know where their brands have been. Other people might have touched their butts and not washed their hands after. It makes them laugh, but I think it makes the point.", "Yes staphylococcus is a nightmare. I worked hospitality too. Had it for about 3 years. Got on to my kidneys and spent 3 wks in hospital too. Horrid anti biotic resistant bs that I\u2019ll never forget either.", "People still aren\u2019t doing it. The amount of times I\u2019m in the public bathrooms and do not hear that sink run is concerning \ud83e\udd22", "I always carry disinfectant wipes to hotels and wipe doorknobs, faucets, light switches, and most especially the damn tv remote because EVERYONE touches that.", "Aren't doorknobs one of the dirtiest day-to-day items for this reason?", "I stull remember second grade Elementary school... yep, the other kids wouldn't wash. pissed me off them, pisses me off now.", "It\u2019s been found that changing as soon as you get home is a good idea - the people in the group got less sick than people who remained in the same clothing.", "As soon as I get in my car from any public experience I baby wipe and/or use sanitizer.", "Huh, have I\u2019ve been doing ikea wrong? I sit on all the chairs, beds, kitchen tables. I open the drawers, touch the pillows, blankets and bins full of stuff. Then eat in the cafeteria at those tables. Ride the escalator and push the carts. There\u2019s always thousands of people at the one I go to.", "I don\u2019t think they should take the baby to the gym", "Yup, staph is horrifying. My uncle got it in his foot. It then spread to his heart, causing blood clots which traveled to the brain. He had three strokes. \n\nIn the end, he needed a heart valve replaced and he has developed extreme aphasia and processing disorder, as well as epilepsy. He was an ambassador of my country, now his husband has to take care of him for life. We're honestly surprised he's still alive after all of that. Staph is no joke.", "Not many people hold babies with their calves.", "Nobody is taking the baby to the gym???", "That\u2019s heartbreaking", "Sure, because everyone holds brand new 2 week old babies dangling using only their hands.\n\nNot understanding what is so complicated here. Does mom go out to the gym, rub her hands, wrists and forearms on disgusting gym equipment and then use those areas to hold baby? Of course not! Why are you so certain in-laws are wearing long sleeves? That seems unlikely. Are in-laws washing up to their elbows or any exposed skin that could come into contact with baby when holding? Sounds super doubtful considering anyone with common sense would not go to a brand new baby strait from the gym.", "Correct", "Is really is, though he is making the best of it. He's lucky enough that he wasn't very physically impaired, and he's been working extremely hard to get back to a functional place. He's now able to travel to us on his own by public transport, he's able to be at family functions and participate in most games and he's reconnecting with his social circles.\n\nThis takes balls the size of frigging coconuts, because he can't speak a normal sentence despite two years of therapy. He even gave a \"speech\" in his previous workplace. He didn't allow anyone to edit it because he wanted to show them where he was at. Heartbreaking, yes, but I have so much respect for this man. He has such a positive attitude and he's enjoying life to the absolute fullest."]}
