I text and ask how everyone is, and he says the kids are sick, but he has it under control.  I'm like, out with it, how many and what are they sick with.  He's like 3 are throwing up, and the youngest has a fever.  But have fun. I've got this. Told my friends the kids were sick, and it was nice to see them, hightailed it to the store to pick up some meds, and rushed home. I come home, and the place looks like it got hit by a tornado.  Vomit is on the ceiling.  My husband had a kid on each hip, trying desperately to clean. So we spent the next day dealing with the stomach bug from hell.

He needs to understand that you need him to take an active role in caring for her, not just don't what you tell him, when you tell him, how you tell him (which still leaves a majority of the mental work up to you). Counseling is probably a good idea, because you've said the last 2 YEARS of your daughters only 2\u00bd year existence has been hard, and I get the feeling that you and your husband didn't discuss what roles each of you expected the other to play when you had kids. That needs to get hashed out NOW, and you will have to teach him some of the ways your daughter needs to be cared for, and get him to do these things several times while you are home.
