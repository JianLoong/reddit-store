I came home to a house in disarray, table had not been cleaned from dinner, daughter had not had her bath, and other than ordering pizza for dinner, no other forward motion had been made to get our child into any sort of nighttime routine. I should add that my MIL was at the house as my husband had called her over to help. Husband jokingly says - \"we didn't get anything done.\" I bit my tongue until this morning after a fitful night of interrupted sleep with our toddler (her sleep is off, but that's an entirely different post) - and I told him that I would have been better off hiring a babysitter the night before because a teenager could have accomplished more. He was defensive and responded that it was just a hard night. I get that, our kid is 2, so much of it is hard. I also know that when he plays in sports leagues 1-2 times a week and watches football at a bar 1-2 nights a week - I somehow manage to cook dinner, bath our child, brush her teeth, clean as I go, and get her calmed down if not totally in bed.

Before you get angrier and angrier that you work outside the home and also do almost all the family/home work while he relaxes and does what he wants.

And that your daughter is his and only his responsibility 4 days this week, and 3 days the next. And that you can re-assess the situation after those 2 weeks.\n\nThen make it so. Do not lift a finger in the house or regarding your daughter those 4 days. Let him be \ud83d\udcaf responsible for it all. If you can, leave the house. A hotel is always nice.

Back when I was pregnant with our 5th kid, some friends of mine came to town. So my husband said, \"Go hang out.\" I got this. So I'm eating with my friends and I get a text that our oldest is looking kinda green.  I ask if he needs me to come home, and he says no, but he may need me to get some children's meds before heading back. Ok. We have a nice leisurely dinner and my friends ask if I want to watch a movie.  I say let me check with hubby and see how things are going.  I text and ask how everyone is, and he says the kids are sick, but he has it under control.  I'm like, out with it, how many and what are they sick with.  He's like 3 are throwing up, and the youngest has a fever.  But have fun. I've got this. Told my friends the kids were sick, and it was nice to see them, hightailed it to the store to pick up some meds, and rushed home. I come home, and the place looks like it got hit by a tornado.  Vomit is on the ceiling.  My husband had a kid on each hip, trying desperately to clean. So we spent the next day dealing with the stomach bug from hell.

Women need to take responsibility for the men they allow inside of them. They are rewarding this poor behavior.", "Or perhaps men should take responsibility for the results if their orgams.
