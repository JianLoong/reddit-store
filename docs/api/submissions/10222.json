We are currently saving up to buy our first house.  We started saving about a year ago and are hoping to buy a home this summer if the market in our area adjusts in a beneficial direction.  We are already pre-qualified with a lender and are closing in on our goal amount for the down payment.  \n\nOnce a month I will go to a nearby casino and spend some time gambling.  I do the same thing every time I go.  I put $200 in one pocket and use that for gambling.  Anything I win goes into a different pocket.  Once the $200 is gone, I leave with whatever money I have in the other pocket.  I usually just sit at a $5 blackjack table since that's the game I enjoy the most and if I just make minimum $5 bets, I can play for a couple hours and call it a night.  Most nights I end up around even.  But sometimes I lose $100-150 and a few times I've come home with an extra $200-300.  I never, ever take out more than the $200 I allow myself to start with and if I come home with winnings, that money goes directly to the house fund.\n\nMy wife is an artist and spends a lot of her free time painting and drawing.  She has a very large collection of paint and other supplies.  She spends a lot of money on her supplies and equipment.  She will sometimes sell a painting or drawing to friends or family, but she mostly just does it for her own enjoyment and relaxation.  She doesn't do commissions or anything that would make money off her art.  \n\nThis past weekend I was going to go to the casino but my wife stopped me before I left.  She said I shouldn't be going to the casino and throwing money away when we are trying to save for a house.  I told her that I don't see how me going to the casino once a month for $200 is any different than her buying new art supplies.  I gestured towards a box of new art supplies my wife had just gotten and asked her how much all of it cost.  She didn't answer that and said that it's different because art is a hobby for her and gambling could lead to addiction.  \n\nI reminded her of my system and that I never stray from it.  I told her I just do this because I enjoy it, like a hobby, and that anything I come home with goes into the house fund anyway. She said if I had just taken all the money I spend at the casino, we could already be at our goal by now.  I told her I could say the same thing about her art supplies.\n\nI told her I will make a deal with her.  I will stop going to the casino if she can go 2 full months without buying new art supplies and only using the things she already has.  She told me that's not a fair deal because she's always discovering new things she needs as she progresses through projects.  I told her in that case, I'll be home from the casino in a few hours.  \n\nShe got mad at me and told me I'm being a selfish jerk and for caring more about gambling than getting a house.  I left instead of fighting with her.  Ended up coming home up $150.", "created_utc": 1676666781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114x56d/aita_for_telling_my_wife_i_will_stop_gambling/", "score": 522, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Admittedly I also have a craft supply problem myself hehe)\n\nI think you should probably sit down together and make a budget in which both of you set aside an equal amount of fun money that you can individually use on your chosen hobbies, whatever those hobbies are.

Your wife doesn\u2019t get to judge or control your hobby expenses any more than you judge and control hers. NTA.", "NTA. But the answer here is pretty simple: you each get a budget for fun money. You use it for gambling, she uses it for art. You decide together how much you can spare for that fun money. Then you stop nagging each other about it.", "NTA. And you can become addicted to anything, including buying art supplies. You seem to have a pretty good method for your casino trips and I\u2019m sure she knows about it so is she really concerned you\u2019re going to get addicted or does she just want to justify her belief that only you should be cutting costs?

I run for enjoyment, but it could become an addiction (ex. running too much, buying too many running clothes, buying too much gear).\n\nI would sit down with your wife to go over money lost when it comes to the casino and art supplies. In my opinion, if your wife isn't making enough money to cover the art supplies that she buys every month, I don't think they are worth it.\n\nAt least with you, the absolute most you'll lose is $200. If she is spending more than $200 and not making enough money to cover that, then she's a hypocrite.", "If you have \"fun money\" budgeted, it shouldn't matter whether you're buying art supplies, a gaming experience, or 200$ worth of gumballs.\n\nNTA\n\nFWIW, In my many years working in casino table games, you are one of the most disciplined gamblers I've ever run across.", "NTA, you're treating blackjack like a hobby and being responsible about it.

While I think her hobby is healthier than yours, it is still a hobby (dangerous hobby but a hobby nonetheless). I do something similar to you, I gamble once a month and walk in the casino with my license and the money I\u2019m planning on spending. No debit cards, just what I\u2019ve budgeted. Is it the healthiest hobby? No. But I deal with a lot of bullshit day to day and I have money Im ok with spending to have a little fun every once in a while. \n\nIf you go into the casino thinking you\u2019ll walk out with more money, or are looking to cover your rent, then it\u2019s a major problem.

It's not like you're tapping the bank when you run low which would indicate a real problem. This might be a less popular opinion, if she's tapping that much she really does need to start selling off work. She's already doing all the work, why not profit from it? There's a lot of collectors out there. Look into ebay for fast sales. Etsy is for pricier projects. I totally get where both of you are at and think you can totally find equilibrium. \n\nI don't know what kind of artist she is but there's a community that buys and sells miniature paintings called ACEOs (art cards editions and originals). They're art the size of baseball cards. You can paint, draw, or do anything you want if it's 3.5\"x2.5\" It's a good way to earn a little.

It might indeed be best if you both dial back the hobbies until you save up. If it's true that the amount you have spent would have been enough to get you to your down payment goal, then neither of you are prioritizing well. \n\nLook at the actual math and see how much both of your hobbies are slowing down your goal. Then decide together on a fair amount you can each spend without judgement.", "NTA you have a good system and stick to it. Gambling is as much a hobby as anything else. It just has a negative stereotype attached to it.", "NTA - You don\u2019t have a gambling addiction, you have a gambling hobby. People can also just have general shopping addictions, even with art supplies, so her argument doesn\u2019t hold water. You two both have hobbies and it\u2019s not wrong to enjoy them every once in awhile. And I do believe yours is probably less expensive than hers, especially since you sometimes make money from it.\n\nShe might just be stressed about funds in general, but her singling you and your hobby out and trying to put all of the blame on you isn\u2019t okay. If she\u2019s feeling worried, she needs to talk about her concerns with you and come up with ways you both could save *together,* not just try to ban you from your hobby.", "NTA - As long as you dont have an addiction, your request is fair. Your hobbies are as important as hers, and the money spent on painting or on gambling is the same. You both should have a similar budget to spend freely on your separate hobbies and have a clear saving amount that should be save for the house.", "NTA. \n\nGambling is a hobby. Hanging with friends over drinks is a hobby. Gaming is a hobby. Photography. You get the picture. \n\nHobbies cost money and $200 a month is not an insane amount for a hobby and it is unfair of her to be upset that you take 1 night a month to indulge in your hobby, as long as it isn't a problem. Especially, since it sounds like she spends just as much, if not more, on a hobby that you haven't brought up. \n\nI would talk to her about why she feels like her hobby is an acceptable expense and yours is not. That seems like something that should be squashed sooner rather than later.", "NTA - you don't sound like you're in any danger of a gambling addiction, probably even less that her of becoming an art supplies addict.", "Ask her if she\u2019d prefer you take up golf - she\u2019ll force you back into gambling within a month.", "NTA \u2026. As expressed he has a hobby also \u2026. My sister got on my case years ago because I went to Vegas for a couple of days \u2026. I returned the favor by saying she was wasting more money by going to DisneyWorld & having zero chance of coming home with any money\u2026. I came home with about half of my allocated gambling money", "NTA, but you and your wife need to discuss this.\n\nYou should both be able to have some \"fun\" money.  Having a savings goal is admirable, but you do need to enjoy yourselves a bit or it becomes draining.  Would $200 each per month really impact your savings goals?  Discuss setting a limit that's comfortable for both of you, and stick to it.\n\nWhile I can understand your wife's concerns about a gambling addiction, it seems like you are really disciplined about your limits, and treat it as a hobby.  \n\nI think your wife needs to be more transparent about what she's spending on supplies as well.\n\nFWIW, I am also an artist in my spare time.  My medium is glass, and it's not cheap!  I dabble in other media as well - photography, watercolour, pastels, drawing (pencil, markers), and have lots of supplies.  I am like a kid in a candy store when I get to a good art supply store, or an art glass store.  It's really easy to spend way more that I had planned, although I am good at sticking to a budget, and will generally reinvest the proceeds of any sales into my supplies, unless we have an unexpected expense.  It's about priorities.", "NTA, you seem to be treating gambling as it should be, entertainment. You are probably down a few percent (since that's how casinos make money), but the thing is that your wife is down even more money since she doesn't really make any.\n\nIf you were just spending your whole life savings or just wasting $200 a month then I might see you as the AH, but clearly you are just treating it as entertainment and may be spending even less than your wife (most likely).", "NTA, if you truly stick to your system it really should be a very affordable hobby as house edge for blackjack is only 2%. So on average year it should be costing you only about 50 bucks. But you should keep track of your losses/gains just to make sure you are playing optimally.", "NTA. Technically, yes, gambling addiction is a thing. But ANYTHING can become an addiction. Total up for her how much you've spent on your hobby vs how much she spends, as well as gains for both. Numbers don't lie.", "NTA\n\n1) You have a system. I like that system.\n\n2) Your wife is a hypocrite. If she didn't tell you the amount her latest purchase was, you can bet that over one month it's a lot of money.", "NTA.  I'm a crafter and left to my own devices I can absolutely spend more than $200 a month in supplies.  It's frighteningly easy.  So long as your system is working for you, it's just a hobby.  It should be worked into your budget, just as her art supplies are.  Sit down with her and write down the budget, allotting funds for her hobbies and yours, and so long as everyone sticks to the plan, it's golden.\n\nThe way you're doing it is the way it should be.  I had an aunt who did similarly with Bingo.  She budgeted a certain amount every week. She'd go out once a week with her friends to hang out, never spend more than her budgeted amount, and if she came home with winnings, so much the better, but she never banked on winnings. We did the same thing with a poker league we belonged to before we had kids.  We budgeted a certain amount of our entertainment money as our buy in and top up money for the night, but once that was gone, we were out.  If one of us won, so much the better, but if not, oh well, we had a fun night out.", "NTA\n\nYou two could set a budget so that your extracurricular funds are totally yours and the other party has no say in what happens to them, and then you don't have to worry because you're always making the savings progress you agree to.", "NTA - if you had a problem with gambling or were ending up spending more than you budgeted for you would be T A but I do this when I go to Vegas. I set aside the amount I'm willing to lose and play with that and don't bet more. Thats a pretty healthy approach to gambling. It's a hobby/entertainment. She may not see it as the same because it doesn't result in tangible \"stuff\" like paintings, but neither does going to the movies or the zoo.   \n\n\nYour suggestion that it's unfair for one person to give up or limit their hobby but not the other is reasonable. Maybe a compromise would be saying that if she halves her spending costs on art supplies you'll go gambling half as often and pool the savings (assuming she's spending a comparable amount on art supplies as you are gambling). That's even though you sometimes win money - my frame of mind when gambling is that it's money I'm ok losing, winning some is just gravy on top of the entertainment value.   \n\n\nTell her if it DOES become a problem, where you can't stop or get compulsive about it or lose money you haven't budgeted then you won't go anymore, but so long as your system is working it doesn't sound out of hand. And recognize that gambling is something that absolutely CAN progress to gambling addiction, but plenty of people gamble sometimes with \"fun money\" and don't let it become a problem.", "NTA\n\nYou have a pretty smart system and doesn't go too far as long as you stick with it.  As long as you stick with your system and it's only with your $200 a month fun money, then I don't see the problem.  Not everyone who gambles has or will develop an addiction.", "NTA. Your gambling is a hobby as much as hers, and as you say, you're not an addict. You should both be able to spend the same amount in your respective hobbies, but you should also be able to keep any of your winnings as the $200 is the cost of gambling and not related to winnings/losses. Good luck!", "NTA, all your points are sound. You are not an addict and are just doing it for enjoyment. You are handling going to the casino perfectly.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is being a hypocrite. If you indeed do not stray from your system, then she has no grounds to call your hobby an addiction.", "NTA\n\nWhat's with these stupid Y T A answers?? You have a great system that limits your losses and you enjoy gambling. Your wife can keep her nose out of what you spend your fun money on and then she can purchase her $200 art supplies as it's only fair.\n\nThis is coming from a painter with lots of art supplies who is married to a man who gambles annually on a trip to Reno.", "NTA.", "NTA- especially if you aren\u2019t taking from money that would go into the household fund. Just be careful it doesn\u2019t turn into an addiction", "NTA. You have your hobby that never strays from a 200 expense, and she has hers, which I'm willing to bet goes far above 200 dollars a month. Unless she's selling her art and bringing in cash, it's not even equitable, because on some nights, you actually bring home money. This is no different than you having any hobby that doesn't produce a physical thing to show for it. Maybe you go golfing. Maybe you go boating. Maybe you go out to a movie every weekend, or something that is just entertaining and fun for you, but costs a little. \n\ntbh, Next time she brings it up, ask her for all the receipts for the last 3 months of her supplies. Not only am I pretty sure it goes well over 600, but ask her what she expects you to do in place of gambling? You're spending money on yourself, either way. Sounds like she's not okay with that, and somehow the onus of this house is falling entirely on your shoulders and not hers. And blaming it on 200 a month is a petty thing to throw out.", "NTA BUT it does sound like you and your wife need to communicate. $200 a month for a hobby sounds completely reasonable to me whether it\u2019s gambling or art supplies. \n\nHowever you don\u2019t specify (nor does she apparently) how much she\u2019s spending on art supplies. If she\u2019s spending $50 every other month in comparison to your $200 a month (and is it just $200? Do you drink/eat/etc while at the casino?) that\u2019s not great. If she\u2019s spending $400 a month to your $200 a month, that\u2019s not great either! If you\u2019re serious about saving and budgeting you should both have a fun money allowance, and it should be spent however you want, but you\u2019ve gotta talk about it first. \n\nAnd also for the record: go two months without using art supplies vs the casino isn\u2019t really fair like, you run out of paint eventually man.", "NTA. Spending $200/mo at a casino and having a system to keep yourself in check is pretty reasonable. That\u2019s just how some people choose to unwind. That is light years away from having a gambling addiction. Some people just think gambling = bad.", "I grew up in Vegas and have personally seen some very sad things in regard to peoples\u2019 gambling habits and their livelihoods.

He felt guilty for the lack of money he put in savings  Vs what he was spending so automatically it was my fault( he thought I was ordering food too much). I had to sit down and write everything down what I spent how I bought it(mostly with gift cards I was gifted).  I spent the money I made for groceries/school supplies. I also buy stuff for my craft but I\u2019m not consistent with buying the things I need for it as it adds up fast and I have more important things that need to be taken care of. As for him, he went to concerts and bought merch to constantly going to the dispensaries to buying games etc etc so not to be petty I wrote it all down for me and him just so he can see it. Now this could of gone two ways but luckily he apologized he had forgotten the concerts were this year among other things. I recommend sitting down with her an doing spreadsheets together. Make sure to note exactly how much you put into savings too and have her do the same. But don\u2019t be confrontational, say something along the line of hey I think this would be a great idea if we did this together so we can address any concerns we both may have and it would help us if we can look at it side by side so there\u2019s no confusion.

Start a spreadsheet and keep track of your wins and losses, and see if she will start one for her art supplies. 200$ is not make or break for a home fund once a month. Once you own a home you\u2019re going to need to start a repairs/upkeep/reno fund so no sense giving up your hobby just to push for it or you\u2019ll be expected to give it up forever- there is always something that should be done when you own a home.", "NTA.

I like to watch the weigh ins and see if someone had trouble making weight or who look depleted.  \n\nA lot of the fun of it for me is the research and the digging in and trying to find any little bits of info that can give me an advantage. \n\nThe most I have ever lost was 10 dollars. The most I ever won was 600. To be fair I bet 100 to win the 600. The card I bet a little bit more then normal on was the dos Santos vs Covington card. I parlayed almost the whole card. They had colby as a heavy dog that fight and I remember thinking no way is should dos Santos be that heavily favored.( I thought he should be the favorite just not by that much) Sometimes when there's a foreign fighter that's popular fighting a unpopular fighter the odds get whacky.", "As long as she's using those new supplies I don't see what the issue is.\n\nAll Art - but especially mixed medium - uses a variety of supplies. I, as a beginner artist, as have 3 different water colour palettes, 2 different oil palettes, multiple papers, pens, pencils, paintbrushes, tapes, rulers. I use it all depending on the project I'm undertaking.\n\nThat's also the specific stuff I've bought. That doesn't include items I've found around the house to use (like jars, plastic plates, aluminium, wood shavings, gladwrap, tissues, textas, sponges).\n\nThat also is just the painting I do. I also do fibre arts (knittiing/crochet/embroidery) and sewing projects (usually household stuff like quilts and bags, cushions etc). I'm pretty proud of these because I've won a few big awards. That also takes up a huge amount of supplies (different yarns, fabrics, threads, needles, cutting implements, sewing machines) and often require outside help to complete the bigger projects because I might need an industrial machine.\n\nI'm also about to start to learn furniture making.\n\nAlso art supplies run out. They need to be restocked. It's not unusual for me to have regular packages to restock stuff.\n\nThe difference between art and gambling is also pretty huge in terms of affect.\n\nIf the wife has a smidge of talent and puts in effort into marketing herself she could sell her pieces and monetise them in different ways (prints, etsy stores, art influencing, teaching).\n\nGambling will more often than not just take money out of your pocket. Unless you're good enough to go pro and make a living out of it consistently you'll lose more money than you gain.\n\nThe effect of art can also be enjoyed by everyone in the household. Items you make can be used practically or as decoration or simply to inspire or provide a talking point.\n\nGambling provides a talking point maybe, possibly a social outing for the family but he's doing it solo.\n\nI don't say hobbies have to make money but these two aren't equivalent money wise at all.\n\nArt tends to relax, inspire and provides a creative and sometimes social outlet.\n\nGambling might provide a social outlet but I've seen very few people relaxed from it.\n\nAll that leads to is that shopping for supplies is unlikely to be an addiction. Gambling has all the elements that can and frequently does lead to addiction. It might be OK now, but much like alcohol, if OP ends up in a bad place it can take an unhealthy turn real fast.", "So are video games. Are you willing to stop playing then?", "Gambling doesn't have to be an addiction. Stop stereotyping.", "Yeah! Gambling $200 once a month is totally an addiction. Just like having a glass of wine once a month makes you an alcoholic!", "Blackjack can totally be a hobby, countless books have be written on various strategies, and $200/month is totally acceptable as a personal entertainment budget.   You're being judgmental and trying to shame him based on nonsense.", "Oof... ratio'd on a 'get over yourself' comment, must be embarrassing. \ud83e\udd23", "Shopping, even for art supplies is an addiction too. We just have normalized it by now.", "If he wins 5 hands at $5 he he literally made 5x the original amount. If he loses one after that he\u2019s then at 4x the original amount . There\u2019s many ways he can make more than double his money on it. I don\u2019t think math is your strong suit.", "Yes, but you are failing to realize that if he's splitting or doubling down, then he's no longer just playing $5 for that hand anymore. Also, side bets can still be played if you are playing the table minimum. I've won $1,800 off of a single $100 bill before. Your \"rationale\" makes no sense.", "You\u2019re probably the only person in existence who thinks that going to the casino once a month for a few hours constitutes a gambling addiction. \n\nYou can not believe OP all you want - it\u2019s certainly true that you\u2019re only hearing one side of the story - but, you shouldn\u2019t insert your own narrative or fact pattern. \n\nWife certainly could have reassessed her art spending no? Shopping can also be an addiction no? \n\nI could just as easily claim that she\u2019s addicted to purchasing art products. See how that works? \n\nAnyway. Ta-ta.", "Could OP be lying and gambling irresponsibly? Sure. That's true for anyone on this sub. But based on what OP reports it seems like he's gambling in a safe and responsible way so that's what I'm going to judge on.   \n\n\nNothing about what he describes reads as a gambling addiction.", ">I also don't believe OP when he says it's only $200 once a month.\n\nI mean, if you're going to invent your own narrative you can spin anything...", ">I also don't believe OP when he says it's only $200 once a month\n\nYou're right, it's $200,000 a month.  High Roller tables baby!", "judgement of who is an asshole, not what is a hobby.\n\nnoun\n1.\nan activity done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure.", "Gambling once a month is not addictive behavior. By your logic, someone who goes out to have drinks with friends once a month is an alcoholic.", "lol ok Grand-wazoo, royal gate keeper of what is and isn\u2019t a hobby.\n\n(before you reply with something ignorant, you might want to google the definition of hobby first)", "Not everyone who gambled is or becomes an addict. Just like not everyone who drinks becomes an alcoholic. Wtf", "According to you, OP has a mental illness - addiction. Do you have an excuse for your attacks on him or are you just using bigoted talking points?", "AFAIK you are responsible for declaring your winnings (the threshold is like $600 but the irs wants you to claim everything). I looked up when you receive a tax form from casinos (this is in the US) this is what I found: [Generally, you'll receive an IRS Form W-2G if your gambling winnings are at least $600 and the payout is at least 300 times the amount of your wager. The thresholds are $1,200 for bingo and slot machine winnings, $1,500 for keno winnings, and $5,000 for poker tournament winnings (and the payout doesn't have to be 300 times the wager for these types of winnings). Your reportable winnings will be listed in Box 1 of the W-2G form.](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/603033/tax-tips-for-gambling-winnings-and-losses)\n\nAt these thresholds they may even be required to withhold 24% for taxes. (Super interesting had no idea!) \n\nBut all of these are for large payouts. I\u2019ve never been asked for ID to cash in chips for a small amount like a couple hundred dollars. Also some slot machines payout in change so that would be hard to track also.", "You\u2019re right I assumed you were asking that as an argument against OP since you included him as an AH (why?). \n\nBut how is gambling money \u201cjust gone\u201d when it\u2019s spent when it has an innate chance of return?", "Could be, not guaranteed. Not a lot of people are willing to spend money on used art supplies or someone's hobby art unless it's fabulous. Look, hobbies are hobbies. Not all of them are tangible. It'd be no different than if he bought a gaming system or had Steam and spent 200 bucks on new games every month. New headset. New controller. New gaming chair. Just because he'd have 'stuff', it wouldn't make it any better or worse of a hobby.\n\nAnd he does come home 'up' sometimes. So his hobby has likely put more money into the home than hers. I'm reading into this in a way that tells me whatever money she likely gets from selling a piece to a relative goes back into her hobby pot. His doesn't. His 'up' money goes into household expenses. Out of the two of them, I'd say he's the more responsible party.\n\nMoney back isn't what you're supposed to be looking at in terms of a hobby. It's about what it does for who partakes in it. He's not in excess of it. He's not in debt. He's happy. Once a month, he gets to be happy. She has her hobby that she probably drops more into than he does. And she's happy with it. In fact, so is he. The only one not happy here is her, and it seems like a dick move for her to call out the one thing he does once a month that costs money (and sometimes doesn't) as if that's the only reason they don't already have a home. I'd actually advise couples counselling, because it sounds like they could use it. What if it wasn't gambling? What if it was going out to his buddy Brian's house and playing poker once a month and having a guy's night? Or going out to a club? Drinks would cost more than 200 a month and there's zero return on that. \n\nThe financial situation here isn't the problem. They're not broke or in debt or w/e. The problem is her seeing his one hobby as the cause of her not getting what she wants and not her own hobby. The onus of this is not entirely on him and it shouldn't be. He gave her a reasonable offer of 2 months of nothing for both. Her not taking that says a lot, my dude.", "Art definitely can be expensive, it just doesn\u2019t *need* to be. There\u2019s a sculpture made of literal trash in the Smithsonian. And she has art supplies she could be using, but buys new things for existing projects. I understand adding something new as you go from time to time, but not every project should require a large amount of materials.", "Per OP, she has a bunch of supplies around as is. Why can't she use those? Those constraints can produce some great artwork too.", "He literally stated that he has never used more money than he should have so yes he has stuck to it and unless you\u2019ve spoken to him and he told you that he hasn\u2019t then you have no reason to believe that he has not", "You say that as if you have evidence he doesn't.", "What in any of his comments makes you think he isn't sticking to it?", "He has stuck to it.", "That, as well as having the inability to stay out of the casino regardless of having the money to lose or not. But I agree, it's a responsible way to gamble.", "No, he's just saying any entertainment/hobby budget cuts should be mutual.", "gambling once a month is addiction now? It's his hobby and it's just as valid as being an artist.", "Yes, it means \u201ctake the loss\u201d.\n\nNo need to be an asshole\u2026however, it\u2019s fitting for the subreddit we\u2019re in.", "Strong agree, but that can be done without spending $200+ on supplies every month.

It sounds like she's going overboard, but hobbies can just be hobbies.

It's the dopamine (or serotonin?) that is addictive.", "If he\u2019s gambling off enough to make a difference and get bitched at by his wife, then it\u2019s an addiction and problem my dude.
