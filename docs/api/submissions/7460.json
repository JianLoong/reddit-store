Recently, there has been an ongoing issue with one of my roommates, Jess (27F), and not giving her enough of a heads up when I return to the house.\n\nThe first time the issue occurred last month, I had marked on the house calendar we keep I would be out of town on Fri night to return Saturday - however, Jess interpreted my calendar event across Friday to mean that I would be gone both Fri and Sat nights. When I left to return to town on Sat afternoon, I texted I would be there in a few hours. She was taken aback by this information, as she thought I was planning to spend the night Saturday night as well. She asked if I would give her more of a heads up next time and being a generally apologetic person, I said I would. My other roommate was not home.\n\nThe second time this occurred I was out of town with a few friends going camping for three nights. On day 3, we decided to head back that night instead due to bad weather. I did not have cell service to text my roommates this information until I got on the main road, then stated the change of plans and that I would be home in a few hours. Jess was the only one home and and she was really annoyed. \n\nThis leads to yesterday - we have all been away on winter break for a few weeks. She texted, stating she would be home Fri morning. I texted that I would be back Fri night or Sat morning from my parents house two hours away. On Fri afternoon, my boss texted me saying there was a shift open Saturday and I decided to take it. Since work starts early AM, I decided to leave my parents house then and texted her that I was heading out soon and would likely be home around 7:30/8pm. She texted back, \u201care you serious? Not again. Your texts say you\u2019re going to be back Saturday, and then you switched your plans around and gave me two hours warning.\u201d I tend to automatically diffuse conflict by apologizing, so I apologized that I didn\u2019t let her know earlier and offered to stay the night at my parents and I would just drive back super early. My parents both told me I was crazy for apologizing.\n\nAfter reflecting about it, I texted Jess: \u201cI apologize that your were caught off guard again, my texts in the group chat actually say I will be home tonight or tomorrow morning, so I\u2019m not sure why this is unexpected. It was a quick decision to return tonight as my work plans changed but I assumed since you expected me to possibly be home tonight, a few hours warning was enough. I think we need to have a discussion on your expectations for warning when I will be home.\u201d\n\nShe has not responded.\n\nI really do want to understand her perspective but I\u2019m stumped. I\u2019ve never had this issue with a roommate before. I genuinely want to know if I am an asshole for these situations and throwing her off guard?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's really none of her business. I've had my fair share of roommates and this has never been a thing with any of them. Maybe if we have plans together or something but it's really just none of their business how you live your life. In fact, I'll go there and say if a roommate treated me this way we wouldn't be roommates for long. It's creepy.

It's your home just as much as it is hers, so you should be able to come and go as you please unless you're making loud noises in the middle of the night waking everyone up. Why does she need a warning?

She has another roommate, so clearly, neither of those options would be feasible.", "Off the top of my head, the reasons I can think of for this type of reaction are:\n\nSome sort of sex work. \n\nSomething to do with drugs. \n\nHaving parties that she doesn\u2019t want her roommates to know about. \n\nSecret boyfriend. \n\nSecret girlfriend. \n\nSome sort of extremely nerdy hobby she\u2019s terrified of people finding out about. \n\nSomething illegal that doesn\u2019t involve sex work or drugs. \n\n\nNext time you\u2019re coming back unexpectedly, just don\u2019t bother to send her a heads up.

Ridiculous you've put up with this shit.", "NTA\n\nYou live there. First time was on her, she misread the calendar. Second time was weather. Might have changed her plans but it happens.\n\nThis time you literally told her beforehand. I don\u2019t see her issue.", "NTA\n\n\"Dear Jess, sorry that for some reason you're unable to cope with my comings and goings but, last time I checked, you aren't my manager and I don't need to clock in and clock out with you.\"", "OP, NTA... but I have questions for you to consider.\n\n1. Do you realize that the place you rent is yours all the time and that you can come and go as you please? It's good to provide others a heads-up if you are bringing over a guest. You are not a guest. The other residents should expect you to be there at any time unless they have specifically requested to have the home to themselves for a small period of time. Frankly, you three roommates need to have a conversation about what is normal expectation and courtesy and what is not.\n2. Put on the spot, most people tend to respond in their natural style (apologetic, noncommittal, defensive, accusatory...); so I can understand your initial quick apology. But after the second time it happened, why are you not asking questions of this roommate? Why are you not asking her why she wants and feels she is owed so much advance notice about your returns? There is nothing aggressive, unkind, confrontational... in asking to understand. Compare your roommate expecting you to provide day-plus advance notice of your return with you asking to understand why. Which one seems more confrontational/ aggressive to you?\n3. Roommate may just be doing something she's really embarrassed about (or may be doing something she knows is wrong/ you wouldn't be OK with). If so, she needs to do that in the privacy of her own room so that you and the other roommate are free to come and go as you please. Or she needs to find another living situation where she's free to do whatever she's doing. Seriously - what is she doing that requires many, many hours advance notice of your return? Why is it specifically when you and the other roommate are planning to both be gone overnight?\n4. You may not mind EVERYONE texting when they plan to return, but honestly (1) it's a mental burden to remember to do that, (2) plans change, and (3) it would need to remain a courtesy and never become an expectation. Roommate has already blown through that line and persisted in making it an expectation of hers, so it being a courtesy you are willing to do is not really possible.", "Ooo she's DEFINITELY up to something hinky. You're a better person than me, I'd be showing up randomly to see what she's doing", "I'm sorry, what? This is so weird. I understand alerting a roommate that you won't be back so they don't worry (if you're friendly), but giving notice that you're coming back to your own home? Nope. NTA and please stop letting her police you. You can come and go as you please.", "NTA. What is she doing that makes her have such a visceral reaction when your plans change. This is sketchy and I would get to the bottom of it if I were you.", "Just be like I live here asshole I can come and go as I please", "Nta but stop apologizing! You live there, why do you need to give a heads up? Agreed with everyone else saying it sounds sketchy. Why does she need more than 2 hours for a wanting? Or any warning at all? Something weird is going on", "You know she's got someone sleeping in your room while you're not home, right? Or she's otherwise breaking house rules?", "NTA. It's your home. While it may be courteous Incase she has someone over, you can come and go as you pleas without giving anyone notice.", "NTA\n\nAre the walls very thin in your flat? Maybe the only time she feels comfortable enough to have sex/masturbate is when you are not home. I understand why it affects her when you come home early but it\u2019s your home too and you need to lay down a firm boundary that this is your flat too and you can come and go whenever you want to. Sending her a heads up a couple hours early is more than being considerate about the face that she might be doing something she wouldn\u2019t do with you around.", "I don\u2019t know. It depends on why she is doing this. Have you asked her why? E.g. she could be doing something sketchy and doesn\u2019t want to be caught. Or, is she neurodivergent? I need to have a set schedule and know when my family are going to arrive so I can mentally prepare sensory wise. It all depends on what the reason is.", "NTA. You pay to live there. She\u2019s not letting you crash at her place as a favor. Stop letting her know. You don\u2019t owe her anything. \nYou were letting her know as a courtesy but she didn\u2019t appreciate it.

You pay rent, you should have the expectation to come and go freely.  If she (or any of you) wants the house to yourself, then, coordinate that separately. \n\nSet up a roommate meeting.

This your home and she is not your parent.\n\nYou do not need to \u2018check in\u2019 on when you are using that space or not. Is it courteous to let a roommate know they might be able to chill in the house solo? Sure.

What the hell is she doing that she needs more time to prepare for you coming back to YOUR home that you pay your share of rent for?", "NTA.

She's overreacting but I understand where she's coming from.", "I just had to double check the ages. I mean WTF. You are nearly 30, you are a lease holder, you don\u2019t need your housemate\u2019s permission to come and go. She sounds entitled at best, and super sketchy at worst. She definitely needs to get over herself. Don\u2019t tell her another thing except to eff off. NTA", "Why do you have to tell your roommate when you're going to be home? Is she baking bread or preparing a  cocktail reception for you?\n\nThis is your home and you can come and go as you please without having to advise anybody of the fact. Just stop indulging her.

Now assuming positive intent here and she\u2019s just wanting to know because she hates surprises or feels safer that way, then she needs to clarify times with you instead of assuming, and she shouldn\u2019t be getting mad when you\u2019re still giving her a heads up.

Sure, you may wish to let roommates know when you go away so they don't worry if you aren't around, but other than that you can arrive back without advance notice as you wish. And what's with the text message to her? You are being weird too. Let me help you re-word it: \"Dear Jess, it is very odd that you have an issue with not knowing in advance when I will be arriving at my home.

I would literally break down sobbing from stress when a roommate would come home from a trip early, because having roommates is SO SO SO SO SO SO SO stressful, even when they're an amazing roommate. Luckily I became financially secure enough to not need roommates anymore eventually, but my late teens/early 20s were ROUGH.

I would plan my days, studying, relaxing time, etc. And I really struggled with putting up boundaries. So if my roommate unexpectedly stayed in, I felt obligated to socialize even if I needed or had expected some quiet time alone. I found it really distressing. However, due to years of therapy I knew that this wasn\u2019t something I could take out on others or expect others to take responsibility for. \n\nJust wanted to provide another perspective. Not everything is so nefarious. \n\nNTA.", "> I'd no longer be letting her know when your coming home anymore, you live there and pay your own rent.\n\nThis.

They could turn up unannounced if they wanted, they are already being courteous by letting them know", "Seriously I feel bad for OP because I was like that 5 years ago. Someone treated me unfairly? I apologised. Someone demanded something unreasonable from me? I apologised. I still struggle with over-apologising to this day but I'm working on it.

Originally we did it because we are all in med school and have a bunch of different rotational shifts each week that are both overnight and day, so it was just generally good to keep track of so we weren\u2019t always texting each other, \u201cdo you have work today?\u201d or weren\u2019t alarmed when someone walked through the door at 7am after a night shift. The calendar has been great, but recently it seems to have shifted to it being some sort of absolute contract or Bible on our exact comings and going\u2019s - writing down work schedules, appts, out of town. I wonder if being so introverted and liking her space, she has become too reliant on the calendar and we need to have a discussion that the calendar is a curtesy of our schedules rather than some sort of binding agreement that is \u201cbroken\u201d when plans change.", "Thank you for this comment - I agree that I do not think it\u2019s anything nefarious, but more of an anxiety around unpredictability. I think my concern was that during our initial discussions she made me feel like I\u2019m the unreasonable one for not warning her, so I wanted to ask if this was normal behavior for roommates because I\u2019m in uncharted waters. \n\nA discussion is definitely in order and I hope to understand more of how she\u2019s feeling and how we can reach some sort of agreement that alleviates some of her anxiety. Absolutely do not want to effect the friendship because of this issue.", "Man back when I had 6 roommates, everyone just came and went on their own time.

Some people would react to an unexpected person in their home with violence, and that could end up tragic.

In the world today I want someone to have my back.  Roommates should be concerned if a friend / housemate disappears.

These aren\u2019t things that are bad just maybe something she worries might seem weird or annoying to others.\n\nMaybe she is the kind of person who is more productive with a deadline so one of the things she likes about having the place to herself is it motivates her to accomplish these things she\u2019d rather do when alone but maybe she procrastinates getting started. \n\nAs a procrastinator who loves a deadline, I actually sometimes tell people in my life to lie to me about when they\u2019re coming to see me.

I always looked forward to those moments of solitude and it was a bummer if someone arrived early or unexpectedly, HOWEVER I never once demanded or expected to be informed of people's schedules because we all lived there. So I understand the sentiment and I believe she's probably not up to anything sketchy while you're gone. She is simply very entitled and needs to manage her expectations of living with people. Not only does she expect to be informed but feels justified to express anger if you don't do it.. not ok. And please don't apologise to her anymore!! Otherwise you're telling her she's correct!", "You\u2019re not unreasonable.\n\nYou could include in the conversation questions about whether it would work better for her if she planned around the idea she won\u2019t have the place to herself, so if she does get it, it\u2019s a bonus, instead of a disappointment when she can\u2019t. She can make that perspective change herself and/or you could offer to stop telling her ahead of time and just shoot her a text last minute. That way she doesn\u2019t need to deal with suddenly not having privacy she thought she\u2019d have. (Tho if suddenly unpredictably being alone causes stress too, this wouldn\u2019t work.) Also lets you communicate in a way that\u2019s closer to typical.

She didn\u2019t like hours notice and wanted my schedule days or weeks in advance, even if she didn\u2019t provide the same \u201ccourtesy.\u201d I thought she was being weird so I set up a camera in my bedroom facing the door with motions detection to text me and send me clips (at the time this was a free app I added to my MacBook built-in webcam, so it just looked like I left my laptop open on my bed) and sure enough, not even 10 minutes after I set it up for the first time and left, she walked straight into my room. I suppose the webcam light clicked on because she looked startled and froze for a second and then ran out. I texted her that moment and said I was moving out by the end of the week, which meant she had to move out too because she could not afford to rent on her own (it was originally her apartment in a month-to-month contract, and she was already in debt to the landlord who let her pay half the rent until she found her next roommate/victim). She got her parents involved who tried to badger me out of it so her daughter would have more time to figure out her situation because they couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t cover the additional rent for her to stay, so I posted my evidence on social media in a funny way (didn\u2019t tag her, wasn\u2019t trying to \u201cbully\u201d and we didn\u2019t run in the same circles so no one who knew her saw it) and sent it to them directly as a reply so she couldn\u2019t try to lie her way out of what she had been doing.

Of course, she could still be using the place as an escort or whatever -  but with you all being in med school, things like sleep deprivation, stress, and crazy shift work can certainly compound into someone feeling overwhelmed and needing to feel a sense of control over little things in life, and small changes seeming like bigger deals than they are.  There are so many things in med school that can feel like you have no control over them (certain patient outcomes, crazy scheduling, dynamics with attendings, etc). Her brain might be overly rigid in categorizing time alone in the empty house as something that she CAN control by planning to fill it a certain way. It could then feel uncomfortabe/ frustrating to have that little slice of time that was hers to control be shortened and to feel that sense of calm complete control of time get tweaked away from the initial plan.

I struggle to understand unspoken rules, and living in a shared space is still not natural to me even though it's been years. Some days I will literally sit on the edge of my bed for an hour trying to gather the courage to go to the kitchen. So, yeah, not knowing when someone is going to come home is extremely anxiety-inducing even if it doesn't seem to make much sense.
