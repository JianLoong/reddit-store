Recently, there has been an ongoing issue with one of my roommates, Jess (27F), about not giving her enough of a heads up when I return to the house.\n\nThe first time the issue occurred last month, I had marked on the house calendar we keep I would be out of town on Fri night to return Saturday - however, Jess interpreted my calendar event across Friday to mean that I would be gone both Fri and Sat nights. When I left to return to town on Sat afternoon, I texted I would be there in a few hours. She was taken aback by this information, as she thought I was planning to spend the night Saturday night as well. She asked if I would give her more of a heads up next time and being a generally apologetic person, I said I would. My other roommate was not home.\n\nThe second time this occurred I was out of town with a few friends going camping for three nights. On day 3, we decided to head back that night instead due to bad weather. I did not have cell service to text my roommates this information until I got on the main road, then stated the change of plans and that I would be home in a few hours. Jess was the only one home and and she was really annoyed. \n\nThis leads to yesterday - we have all been away on winter break for a few weeks. She texted, stating she would be home Fri morning. I texted that I would be back Fri night or Sat morning from my parents house two hours away. On Fri afternoon, my boss texted me saying there was a shift open Saturday and I decided to take it. Since work starts early AM, I decided to leave my parents house then and texted her that I was heading out soon and would likely be home around 7:30/8pm. She texted back, \u201care you serious? Not again. Your texts say you\u2019re going to be back Saturday, and then you switched your plans around and gave me two hours warning.\u201d I tend to automatically diffuse conflict by apologizing, so I apologized that I didn\u2019t let her know earlier and offered to stay the night at my parents and I would just drive back super early. My parents both told me I was crazy for apologizing.\n\nAfter reflecting about it, I texted Jess: \u201cI apologize that your were caught off guard again, my texts in the group chat actually say I will be home tonight or tomorrow morning, so I\u2019m not sure why this is unexpected. It was a quick decision to return tonight as my work plans changed but I assumed since you expected me to possibly be home tonight, a few hours warning was enough. I think we need to have a discussion on your expectations for warning when I will be home.\u201d\n\nShe has not responded.\n\nI really do want to understand her perspective but I\u2019m stumped. I\u2019ve never had this issue with a roommate before. I genuinely want to know if I am an asshole for these situations and throwing her off guard?", "created_utc": 1673857502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10d98jq/aita_for_not_giving_my_roommate_warning_when_i/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your room mate is a control freak and has no say when you come and go!!!!", "NTA\n\numm, you live there...you don't have to give her a heads up lol You get to come and go as you please.", "NTA. Is your roommate running a drug den or brothel when you're away? OP you don't owe her any explanations on your comings and goings. Tell her that you can come and go as you please and that it's not up to her to dictate your schedule. She sounds sketch.", "NTA - if you are paying rent you are allowed to be there any night of the month. I get letting them know as a courtesy in case they have company over, though you don\u2019t owe them an apology for plans changing. If they are going to act this way, just don\u2019t use the calendar.", "Maybe since I've never lived in this situation I dont understand, but why on Earth do you need to give her such advance warning to your plans? You live there and she sounds ridiculous.

If you\u2019re living there and paying rent you really shouldn\u2019t have to announce that you\u2019re coming back.

What the heck is your roommate doing that she needs notice of when you\u2019ll be home? It\u2019s your home too! You should be able to come and go as you please without having to report to someone.

If she'd informed you she'd need the whole house for a private or intimate event, different story.  Plans change, life happens. If you're all in on rent together, you really don't owe her at explanation at all for your comings and goings, you've simply been polite.  Her responses to your updates are mighty prickly.", "NTA, you have as much right to be there whenever you want as she does, if she has a problem with this then she needs to find somewhere else to live. How entitled can she possibly be??", "INFO: why do you have to give an account of your whereabouts? It's where you live, you can come and go whenever you please. You don't need your roommates' permission to enter your own home or not.", "NTA at all - you pay rent to live in this place correct? That gives you the right to come and go as you please without having to inform anyone. I would never apologize for showing up to my own home without announcing it. That\u2019s utterly ridiculous.

It\u2019s weird she does.", "NTA why do you have to give her any sort of notice about your whereabouts you're an adult and she's not your parent. Stop giving her an insight into your business.", " NTA. Since when do we need permission to be in our own homes whenever we want? I can see needing to give roommates a heads up if you\u2019re having guests, or if you\u2019re asking them to care for a pet while you\u2019re gone, but this is ridiculous. You live there. You get to be there whenever you want. You should not have to ask permission to come home. You get to come and go whenever you want- as long as you\u2019re observing agreed upon house rules, she has no right to restrict your access to your home.", "Wow! I'm stumped, too. You're communicating at a perfectly acceptable level for roommates. You're not randomly bringing home hookups unexpectedly. This is her weird tic. NTA", "NTA... tell her to assume that you will be home every night, and remind her that she's not your mother!", "NTA, I'd be worried about what she's doing in that house if she wants notice for when someone else who lives there is going to return. You've got every right to come and go as you please.", "NTA. Also please update reddit with what your roomate is actually doing while you are away. Is it meth? Or a diaper fetish? Or maybe she records only fans videos? It has to be something", "NTA, you pay rent, it's your room to use as you please.", "Why does she need notice? Does she give you notice? And the third roommate?", "NTA and why the fuck does it matter. They\u2019re your roommates but this is your home you have the right to come and go as you please.\n\nIs she renting your room while you\u2019re gone? Hosting an orgy? I fail to see why she cares and why you have to do this in the first place.", "Stop setting expectations for your departure and arrival,  and then there won't be any..  NTA", "Edit\nNTA. Sorry I\u2019m new here\n\nYou have been courteous by letting her know you schedule. Sometimes schedules change. If she does not appreciate your efforts to be courteous no longer afford her that privilege. It\u2019s your place. You can come and go as you see fit.", "NTA. It is your house and you can come and go as you please. Telling your room mates ahead of time is a courtesy, not an obligation you have to fulfil.\n\nIt would be nice if you could share if Jess is doing the same thing (giving you and your other room mate a heads up and sticking to it). And I would consider looking into a camera or lock for your room if you don\u2019t have any - it does sound a bit sus to me why she needs that much time ahead and a \u201ewarning\u201c.", "NTA.

She's not your mother, and she isn't the only person paying the bills.\n\nINFO - Does she have some form of neurodivergence that makes time management or change a significant stressor for her?

I mean, your post doesn't really give any hints that you guys have any kind of relationship as friends outside of being circumstantial roommates, yet she is expecting you to cater what is clearly some kind of psychological hangup. That is to say, it's your home, you shouldn't have to give her any significant advance warning that you're coming home at all. I mean, what is she even doing that she needs several hours to prepare for your arrival??? Either she's being neurotic or she's doing something weird, like having an orgy in the living room.

Unless she is doing something she shouldn't be there is no reason for her to have this expectation to be notified when you are coming home.", "[removed]", "NAH.
