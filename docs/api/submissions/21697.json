Around five years ago, my birth mother (39F) came to live with us while handling a divorce. It was almost a decade since we last saw her so I can't explain exactly how I felt about her living with us. But we quickly noticed a pattern forming with her. Whenever we would ask her to clean something, she would have a tantrum. Whenever we would ask her to pick something up for us, she would throw a tantrum. Whenever we would bring up to her something she did, she would throw a tantrum. At first I thought maybe it was because she was having a hard time because of the divorce so I didn't say anything about it. But it didn't get better. She began leaving her stuff and garbage lying around and when asked to pick it up, she would act as if she's going to, only for it to be the exact same a half hour later. It's been this way for the past five years and I'm so sick of it that I've just started referring to her as an unwelcome guest. I've asked my aunt and mom about if it's disrespectful and I've gotten two different views. My aunt says its understandable but disrespectful because she's still my mother. My mom says she feels the same but would never say it to my birth mother's face. I'm not sure if I should refer to her as just an unwelcome guest but if thats how she's going to act then I don't see anything else to do.", "created_utc": 1688845943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14udmcj/aita_for_referring_to_my_birth_mom_as_a_guest_in/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
