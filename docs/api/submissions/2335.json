Wow.\n\nYour daughter and her husband are outrageously out of line here, and probably should've put some thought into the impact children have on one's social life before deciding to have them.

Or is it even just that there\u2019s the worry that her grandmother loved her grandchildren more than OP loves hers.", "Still, if OP asks how often she went to her grandparents' house like you said that's going to be the answer. The question won't make the daughter walk back because she isn't asking for any more than what OP recieved from her own parents. OP's challenge is to get her daughter to accept that OP does not intend to be as involved as OP's own parents were.", "NTA. You're still her parent beyond 18 but you're not responsible for helping *her* be a parent if you don't want to. She's an adult who made her own choices. You aren't bound by them.", "NTA her kids her problem, enjoy your life your daughter is demanding, entitled and manipulative", "NTA! you already raised your own kid, its not your responsibility to raise another persons.", "NTA. No ma'am, your daughter and her husband made two babies. Once the little one is expelled from its safe space after 40 weeks or sometimes less it is the parents responsibility to raise them. If she and her husband want a break outside of the time that you spend time with them, they can hire a babysitter. Her delusional attitude about what your role as a grandparent is her problem. Her kids, her responsibility.", "NTA Unfortunately it seems like in many places grandparents, particularly grandmothers, are expected to pick up a considerable amount of slack for children they didn\u2019t decide to have. Babysitting every weekend is a huge ask.", "NTA\n\n> She then said that my obligations and responsibilities as a mother didn\u2019t end the second she turned 18. \n\nThat isn\u2019t leverage for her to use you. Watching them once or twice a month is imo completely reasonable. Being a mother does not mean you have to take on your *adult* daughter\u2019s responsibilities.\n\nIt sounds like you daughter is falling in to the trap of forgetting that you are allowed to have your own life - which is ironic, considering the demand you watch her children every weekend sounds like she wants to have time to herself. At 57 you\u2019re also probably still working. So you work full time and then watch her children on the weekends? Come on.\n\nThere is no reason why she and her husband can\u2019t hire a babysitter if they can afford one - and lots of parents don\u2019t get breaks at all.", "It is ridiculous to demand you take her kids every weekend. If you Want to do that, fine. But you shouldn\u2019t be forced to. \n\nShe chose to have these children. Not your fault she\u2019s tired of them after 5 days. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  She wants you to take them every weekend?  Why isn\u2019t she doing things with them in the weekend?  \n\n\nNo. She\u2019s acting pushy and entitled and you are not in the wrong. If you offer to take them once in a while fine. However if she is asking you to babysit (or expecting it) you can refuse, just like any other babysitter.  Does she offer to pay?  I guessing not\u2026 and she just assumes it. \n\nWhy do people have kids?", "I have a DIL who has never really forgiven me for not doing as your daughter has requested of you. I  always worked a very demanding job plus call, and at the time, I was still raising some younger children of my own. She will never change her mind about this and she will never stop blaming me. I just have to accept that that\u2019s how she feels. Those grandchildren are now grown, and they tell me they understand. My younger children - also now grown - have told me that they would have been upset if I had had the grandchildren all the time because my time with them would have been limited. It doesn\u2019t matter to how my DIL feels. It is what it is. I did the best I could and that\u2019s all I can say.  What I am saying is that you are NTA and you absolutely do owe it to your daughter to do this. But she may still be mad and if you rightfully stick to your position this is something you will just have to accept.", "NTA\n\nI can see her being upset if you never took the kid in and she was struggling. However, when you become a parent, that is your main focus. \n\nYour daughter doesn't get to pass off her parenting duties", "NTA.  Grandparents still have their own lives to live as they see fit. They may love their grandchildren but that doesn\u2019t mean they have to give up their life to become free daycare.", "NTA\nIt's not your responsibility.", "I was a single working mom while raising my boys.  I always told them to remember 2 things.  I wasn\u2019t a stay at home mom so don\u2019t expect me to be a stay at home grandma.  2nd and most importantly - I did not have the fun making the grandkids so wasn\u2019t responsible to raise them.  I\u2019ll help when I can but only as much as I determine.   They are great dads and I love my grandkids, but they are the parents.", "Absolutely NTA. As a parent with two little kids, it\u2019s amazing when my parents watch the kids for a date night, but I would never expect them to watch them in a regular basis (every weekend seems like overkill). She\u2019s probably just struggling and taking it out on you. Maybe she has friends with parents who watch their kids regularly\u2026.either way her attitude is entitled and inappropriate. Sorry you\u2019re in this position.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m 32 and have 3 kids 8,5 and 1. I never expect my parents to watch my kids and I never ask to even if I need a break. I use them only for emergencies which is rarely. My parents ask to see if they can have the kids for the weekend/or 1 night just to spend time. I don\u2019t want them to feel overwhelmed and I also want them to fun special stuff with them when they do have them. I feel like if they had them all the time they wouldn\u2019t want to do the fun things. And besides I like doing movie weekends or go out with my kids because I feel like I don\u2019t see them during the week because of school.", "NTA. And I'm sorry your daughter has laid this guilt trip on you. I'm 35 and can't imagine asking my mom to babysit on a regular basis, as if I'm owed her services or something. It's one thing if a grandparent is eager to babysit, then sure, but to guilt a grandparent into it is not okay. I hope she can let go of this and just be glad that her children have a grandparent to have fun with. I never really had that and was always jealous of kids who did.", "NTA... but it seems to more common now. Parentification of the grandparents", "NTA. That is absolutely not an obligation. You can volunteer to look after the kids more if and when you want, but you don't owe your daughter childcare.", "Nta. You gave birth to her, not her children.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA \n\nAsking the occasional baby sitting is fine, asking for you to take them every weekend so she and her husband can do whatever they please is not. You are the kids co-parent. Has she even took into account that you have your own life/work? Cos she sounds very entitled to your time.\n\nYou did not chose to have the kids, she and her husband did. That means no more child free weekends, weekly date nights etc. Your obligations and responsibilities when your child turned 18 *changed*. Your no longer responsible for them, and certainly not responsible for their kids. \n\nShe needs a nanny or a sitter. Your not it.", "NTA and you are right. You raised your daughter and that job is finished. She has a partner and together they can figure out how to raise their kids. This isn't your job. You are more than allowed to enjoy your senior years, hopefully about to retire and use your time the way you want to use it!\n\nShe got old enough to get married and knocked up twice, she is able to figure out childcare without relying on you. There is a whole industry involved in childcare! But she probably doesn't want to pay their prices.", "I literally only read the first paragraph and your definitely nta. \nEven no contribution would be \"contributing enough\" because (and this part is important) those aren't your kids. \nYou did your time, you've paid your dues. \nTime for your kid to do the same.", "I don\u2019t have grandchildren yet, but I have told my children that their late father and I raised our children, on our own with very minimal help from anyone else and that under no circumstances would I be raising theirs, so they had better be sure they could before they had any. I will, of course, be available for emergencies or extenuating circumstances, but for the most part, I am going to a grandma who keeps grandchildren when *I* want, not a built in free nanny. \nI love my children with all my heart, wouldn\u2019t change anything, and it was totally worth it, but it was, at various times, mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausting and I\u2019m not going through toddlerhood and teenagerhood again.", "Grandparents are supposed to have fun with their grandkids, not act as unpaid childminders.\n\nNTA", "Wow. You need to set that girl straight. NTA", "My daughters grandparents have her once a week and I am beyond grateful. The positive impact it has on my life is more than I\u2019ll ever be able to thank them for. But if they turned around tomorrow and said no more, I\u2019d be so uncomfortable even thinking of leaving my children there. If someone doesn\u2019t /want/ to be around your kids, how could you possibly be comfortable leaving them there?", "NTA- that can be very overwhelming for people especially at that age. As long as you are showing interest in your grandchildren then you have nothing to worry about!", "Your daughter is entitled. Help is nice. It sounds like you do that. NTA.", "NTA, tell her that she needs to take responsibility as the mother of HER children.", "NTA. There is the kind of helping as in providing a safe place to stay, giving advice, and being a comforting figure. They kind of help your daughter seems to want is a free house maid to do the cleaning, feeding, and basically entreatment of the children. That is not your responsibility. You did your part in rising children, now its your time to enjoy the child-free life.", "NTA it always amazes me how entitled people are when it comes to their children. Honestly, she's just lazy and wants to do whatever she wants without her kids. Stand your ground, you're not obligated to watch HER children.", "NTA.  Maybe you didn't raise her as well as you thought you did?  Or maybe she just slept through all the \"Don't be an assh9le\" lessons.  I'm a grandparent, but not a full time babysitter.  Our kids learned quickly that they needed to schedule babysitting quite a ways in advance.", "NTA, but did your grandparents watch you growing up? A lot of people had stay at home moms during your days or grandparents that were willing to help and that's just not something we have for our generation. Everyone is for self these days family is no more. I have a family that would love to watch my children and wish I would move back closer to home but I love the state I am in. Still I feel sorry for people who don't have the same options for support especially since money doesn't stretch as far as it used to and child care is impossible. Don't feel bad I am sure it will just keep getting worse but what I will say is as you age and need someone to care for you hopefully your children don't turn their back on you and shun you like you did them. I see a lot of bitter people with aging parents ranting about how their parents need a caregiver but never cared about anyone but themselves and nobody in the family wants to take care of them so aita for sticking them in a home and the answer to them is the same as it is for you. No NTA it is not your responsibility", "NTA.  You raised your children, she\u2019s responsible for raising hers.   Where is your daughter getting this entitlement?  Every weekend?  That\u2019s crazy.", "Your daughter just wants a different kind of grandma for her kids. Some grandmas dote on the grandchildren and always want to be around them. I guess she was hoping for that. My mom was like that. She was always over here or we were over there. Mom loved it and so did we. It wasn't a duty or obligation it was a natural way of being for mom. You're not that grandma and that's okay. \n\nWould it help your daughter to have you take the kids on a specific day of the week once a week? Could you live with that? If you had had the choice to have your mom help you out wouldn't you have wanted that? You survived without it but maybe it would have been nice to have some regular help?", "NTA. \n\nDoes your daughter work? When do she and her husband actually spend time with the children the choose to have?", "Dear daughter, I have raised you to be smart and strong and figure your way out in the world. You will always be my daughter and the mother of my grandchildren, but yes my legal responsibility did end when your turned 18. Now you are married. You and your husband need to figure out parenthood.  When you had children, my life did not end...is still not over. I still have a lot of life left in these bones to enjoy the world without children. I did not have children to pawn off on my parents every weekend for them to raise. I raised you dear daughter and now it's time for you to raise yours. I will be happy to take my grandchildren from time to time, but I will not do it every weekend nor will I be at your beck and call. \n\nNTA", "You obviously don't have to do anything.

So far, we're lucky if we get one date night a year, and none of our parents have watched the kids overnight.\n\nOP, you're doing an awesome job. Your daughter is being entitled. She's right... you didn't stop being her parent at eighteen. Your job is to answer her phone calls and give her advice. SHE'S your kid. But with your grandkids... you're a grandparent. Not another parent. If she keeps pushing you, draw back on support. Tell her that she's not respecting your boundaries or appreciating your help.", "Hahaha this cracked me up.

NTA", "I'm not a mom, but this is SO what I would do!\n\nNTA, OP. I'm really curious where she got this image of grandparenting, but not your problem.", "The key here you're missing is that the daughter is trying to weaponize the responsibility you were pointing out here and in that case, the mother is totally within reason to point out that her responsibility ends when she's 18.  The daughter started trying to draw the line and the mother needs to make it clear where the line is and that means sometimes being hyperbolic.", "I think you might have misread the post. The mother (57) did not tell her daughter that her responsibility ended when she turned 18. The daughter \u201ctold\u201d her mother that to basically make her feel obligated to watch her grands.", "I'd say your responsibility ends at 18. Everything you do till their 18th birthday is because you HAVE to (you may want to as well, but you will get in trouble if you don't do it). Everything you do beyind the 18th birthday is because you WANT to. \n\nI think that's an important distinction to have because otherwise you will have people like the daughter think it's her parents' responsibility to be their grandchildren's 3rd (and maybe 4th) parent", "Your legal responsibility ends at 18.

You got the best of both worlds. Your daughter will resent you for this if you don't shape up.", "I saw that after I posted my comment, and that\u2019s honestly why I expected. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, this past weekend, my husband and I went to my mom\u2019s house where we set mousetraps, took down heavy items off shelves for her, and refilled the salt in her water softener. A month ago we fixed her fence and removed some blinds. Two months ago we went to his parents\u2019 cabin and helped move and secure an oil tank. In between these events we\u2019ve attended and hosted dinners, driven across town for morning coffee, and dog-sat. \n\nBoth sets of parents are devoted grandparents and regularly babysit and host their children and grandchildren. \n\nI don\u2019t expect any of them to act like Ms. Frizzle or true co-parents, but you certainly can\u2019t get what you don\u2019t give.", "Weaponize the responsibility that she (the daughter) won't do herself...", "I didn't misread anything.

Is there really such a need to interpret his intent with such bad faith?", "I'm not angry exactly.   But I do know people personally whose parents DID kick them out at 18, because \"you're an adult now and not my problem anymore.\"  And if my parents had had that attitude when I had gotten out of the abusive relationship I mentioned above last year, I would have has nowhere to go. \n\nI was 27, making 13.50, and had minimal credit history, minimal rental history, and I couldn't afford to rent anywhere anyway since most places expect you to make 3x rent monthly. \n\nI wanted to clarify based off of personal experience.
