Bullying is when you laugh at someone who is already down.", "Yeah I understand although i did not want to make her the target of a joke in front of others. it was not something personal to her although she ruined my mood on Christmas many times on the past but thats very different from that.", "That\u2019s exactly what it was.  You got it to be funny.  It was given to her in front of everyone.  This would have gone over very differently if you had gotten her a nice present as well.
