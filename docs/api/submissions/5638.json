It was a true gag gift of 2 of these 3 packs of showercap style underwear, so she hit the dollar limit... Hurrah... I really don't understand. I always thought that a \"gag gift\" was supposed to be a cheap, jokey item that cost a buck or 2. You might get a few laughs when your family member/colleague/friend thinks they're stuck with it, but then you pull out your actual Dirty Santa/White Elephant gift. Why bring literal trash to a gift exchange?", "One Christmas my Mom went above and beyond for a gag gift. We had a bunch of normal presents, but there was one giant box for my brother and I.\n\nWe tore into it and were confused. It was the box to a playhouse I'd gotten earlier in the year. Mom said to open it.\n\nInside was another wrapped box.\n\n14 layers more and we each had a ring box in our hands. We opened them to find coal. Yup. Coal. \n\n16 boxes wrapped. Took her about 12 hours to wrap. Took us 20 minutes to tear through. For coal. A stupid gag, and I loved it. (I mean, half the fun is tearing open presents anyway) \n\nI have told this story at least 100 times. One of my best memories of our Christmases. (Honorable mention to getting a whole bunch of moving boxes to play in when I was 7. I played with them for months before they all got too worn) That, and our yearly family Nerf War. It wasn't Christmas unless we ran around the house shooting foam darts at each other.", "I have, but it was ON MY WISHLIST. Cleaning supplies should never be given unasked for, it sends a message that you think they need help in that regard", "That is sheer brilliance!", "Please I need to know lol how did your SD react to it?", "Duuude. This is the only acceptable use of those things. You smashed it. \ud83d\udc4d", "Used ones.", "As you seem to not give a shit about her mood or feelings, I have a really hard time to empathise with you", "I could see myself getting my sister a toilet brush off she'd had a particularly shitty year.  It would be something quirky that fits her personality, and is tell her before she opened it that it was because she'd had such a shit-filled year.  One of the kids would end up calling it the Shitty Santa wand and pretend to be a Christmas fairy, but it would get used to clean eventually.  Probably to scrub dirt off shoes unless she needed an actual toilet brush. Gag gifts can be great for giggles, but you need a proper set-up like you do with most good jokes. \n\nI'd also get her a gift card because that's what she likes to get for all presents.  She saves them up all year long and then splurges on something big or doing a nice thing for herself.", "YTA\n\nGag gifts are fun, If you  gave her a $50 too. They are not fun when that's all you give. It's like telling someone that they are a joke to you.\n\nAlso getting women something for the house is generally a no, unless it's something they asked for like a mixer, or mattress topper. But they have to have asked for it.", "YTA - what year is this, 1954? Giving women cleaning items as gifts is shittier than that toilet brush, and a lazy out-of-date old joke. A toilet cleaner, btw, is like one of the first things people buy when getting a home, so it's probably not even useful like you claim, just a spare. \n\nGag gifts are fine, provided they will actually be used and the joke is clever, but most of the time they are just lazy and completely wasteful. I had a secret santa exchange at work where someone literally gifted me a toilet plunger christmas tree. Like great, glad you all had a laugh at my expense, and now this gets thrown in the trash while climate activists literally beg people to consider their consumption. You're 23, not 13... do better.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA", "We ok", "Did he ask if he was TAH? I thought he asked if his sister was justified in her actions.\n\nYes his sister is an AH.  His present wasn't great but that doesn't give her the right to act totally ungrateful. What happened to its the thought that counts?", "She deserves nothing after acting like that. If a child threw a tantrum like that at a misjudged gift they'd be absolutely shredded as spoiled. But his older sister does it and she's a victim? Nonsense. I'm happy to get as many downvotes as people have to give. \n\nIt comes across like he's trying really hard to agree with everyone having a go at him too. \n\nThis stinks of  a socially awkward sibling getting attacked for trying to be nice.", "To be honest. Going by ops comments and the post. OP is the different person in the family. \n\nAnd I absolutely feel bad for him because I'm that person and have tried to cheer up people with a silly thing only to have people act like AHs. I'm so grateful my siblings aren't AHs and always see the love in my silly gifts. \n\nThis comment section is assuming he's not the one with the good intentions", "This is the closest to agreeing on this thread I've seen. I can't believe you're the only one here who didn't assume OP was trying to hurt his sister. \n\nThe whole post comes across like someone had a tantrum because they got an attempt to make them smile instead of monetary value. I feel awful for the op.", "Apologize, YTA", "Gifts are not obligations. They are voluntary expressions if affection. \n\nMy sister adores when when I buy her a daft gift. In fact I buy silly gifts for all my siblings and my brother said this year I always smash it. \nHe said this right before he opened his box and bent over laughing at his new Woody doll.\n\nThe entitlement of saying \"where's the real gift\" like they're in a shop.", ">Yes his sister is an AH. His present wasn't great but that doesn't give her the right to act totally ungrateful. What happened to its the thought that counts?\n\n\nIt's. A. TOILET BRUSH.", "The difference is no person would be giving a child a \"gag gift\" or a toilet brush to make other people in the family laugh, so to compare her to a child is ridiculous. They gave their sister a toilet brush they thought was \"dumb\", to make their family laugh after a rough year. Clearly their sister is going through some stuff, they could have easily done the gag gift and had something else to go along side it. Their sister even jokingly asked \"where rest\" thinking this was a joke but it wasn't, and once they realized it wasn't a joke they got upset. Imagine giving someone a nice gift to get a gag gift to be the butt of the joke and have everyone laugh at you and what you revived for Christmas. I've done a few gag gifts on my brother, he wasn't happy about them but then soon laughed after he realized it wasn't his only gift. Giving someone a toilet brush, when you know someone is stressed, and had a rough year isn't okay especially whenever they don't laugh. \n\nTrying to be nice isn't just giving someone a gag gift to make everyone else laugh when you know your sibling is stressed and had a rough year.", "So did you get everyone else joke gifts as well? Or did you just decide that your sister sister be laughed at by the whole family while they got something thoughtful? Hope you weren\u2019t thinking you\u2019d be getting an invite to her house anytime soon. \nYou: \n\u201cOh the family needs something to make them laugh.  Hmm, I could get something actually funny, or I could target my sister so the rest of us feel good while we demean her.  Being funny is too much effort, Christmas bullying it is!\u201d", "He wasn't teasing her. Giving her somehing he thought would make her laugh because of its silliness isn't teasing. \n\nIm seeing a lot of entitlement in the comments equating not getting something if monetary value with cruelty. Its shocking.", "He said he was trying to make her laugh too. \n\nHe said they all had a hard year and he was trying to bring levity. \n\nAssuming he had 50 to drop on a gift when the gag gift probably only cost 15. Who demands 50 quid like that?\n\nI almost exclusively buy silly gifts for my siblings. My sister got a muscle arm shaped pillow because she works at a gym. She's happy as shit. \n\nIf I'd bought my older brother this exact gift he'd have laughed, called me an ejit and given a sarcastic thanks. Then the night would have continued. I might have even got a text later with a photo of the toilet brush bouqet on the dining table. \n\nLiterally nothing in the ops post or comments implies anything but a desire to make peope happy.", "I'd gladly take a husband pillow as my main gift. Not because of it's name but because they're expensive af and something really useful if you have to spend too much of your time in bed", "I am of the opinion that it being secondary is really dependent on whether you're the only one getting them a gift or not.  Like if i'm buying a gift for my husband then it should not be the only one.  But if i'm buying a gift for my sister and I know my parents are also by and gifts for my sister and probably my other siblings as well i'm not going to worry about it being the only gift from me.  It does need to be something that sister will find funny though.", "Their sister didn't demand anything, most people who get gag gifts always have something else to go with it, money, gift cards and so on. \n\nAfter seeing op say \"it's dumb I know\" I agree to disagree, you have your opinion and I have mine. I think they should have had a smaller item with the gag gift, or even had a gag gift about an inside joke between them not a toilet brush that most people buy right away when buying a house.", "If OP decided everyone got tacky thoughtless gifts it might be ok, but deciding that only one person should be the target to make the rest of them feel better is an AH move. Why didn\u2019t he make himself the butt of everyone\u2019s jokes if he wanted to bring levity? Or does he not want to be mocked and laughed at? Hmm, maybe he should think about that for a bit.", "He said he was trying yo make her laugh. \n\nHe didn't think of it as anything mean, just something to make her smile. Your entire thing there is predicated on him wanting to target he in some buling rather than be nice and silly.\n\nLiterally nothing the op has said in the post or comments suggests anything other than a socially awkward people pleaser.", "Hey OP my family has had a really rough year. My partner almost died, my grandmother had to be put in intensive assisted living, I got sexually attacked, my parents house got wrecked in a storm, that's just a handful of the year that keeps on trucking. Come Christmas we wanted to have a good but mellow holiday no big event just the core members of our families on our own schedule. Unfortunately said grandma who is 89 with COPD and other issues came down with Covid last week and is in the ICU telling us that she would rather die than be kept alive at this point making the holiday a very grim one. \n\nMy brother and I have a very jokey relationship I saw this as a way to bring some light into our year (before grandma getting sick this year) and as he was diagnosed with bi polar disorder in 2018 and loves the Polar express I found a t shirt that reads \"all aboard the bi polar express\" it's a bit edgy but funny I know he will laugh and wear it and I wrapped it rather than with my normal paper I use on all the gifts I get I used tissue paper to blend it in with the gifts my parents would give him. It caused an abruption of laughter and chaos as he was reacting to the shirt and my parents were reacting to not knowing where it came from and my partner, other siblings, and I giggling knowing the truth. I fessed up and also delivered to him the other gifts I got him that some were funny but the rest were what he wanted. \n\nYTA- Simply for the fact that you know she's stressed about the house and decorating and organizing it so you made the choice to take a day escaping from that stress and refocusing her on that while also attempting to make it all a joke where you are more laughing at her than with her. In my scenario I say that shirt in my cart for two weeks, questioning if my brother owned it already but also questions if it would upset him or anyone in my family in any way because the holiday should be an escape from that not a foster for it. You suck for then proceeding to be upset that she's ungrateful for the gift that you describe as a joke and gag. Also it should be a common rule of thumb that unless people outright ask for it especially women giving them things they use to clean or live are not really gifts and shouldn't be treated as such. If a family needs a new vacuum and they agree that it shouldn't be assumed the budget that goes towards the woman's gift for Christmas or birthday will be where that money comes from because that is unfair to her that everyone else gets thoughtful personal gifts and she is essentially given a chore. That is what you did. You gave her a chore for her new home that she is already stressed about and then you're surprised that she had a stress backed reaction.", "YTA,\n\nYou know she had a stressful year,  so you buy her a gag gift so everyone can basically laugh at her?\n\nDamn op, I feel bad for her. Sure she could have acted better but honestly I would cry if my Christmas gift was just some gag gift to have the family laugh about and not something I wanted or was meaningful In anyway.\n\nYou're family sucks as well.", "I got my sister UTI medication as a horrible but useful gag gift\u2014 but I also got her a switch. Don\u2019t have it be the only present, that\u2019s kind of an AH thing to do, so YTA", "YTA. You're meant to get her something she will love. Could've passed, if it was something that made HER laugh, but you say you bought it to make others laugh. What, at her expense? Not nice.", "For real! If I pack a pile of dog shit nicely and give it to OP he has no right to complain! He should be grateful I took the time to wrap the dog shit for him! C'mon that's just ridiculous. There are gifts no one needs to be grateful for and a freaking toilet brush as the only gift is one of those gifts. I go with hard YTA and the rest of the family is TA too except sister whose reaction is completely understandable.", "Yes. Thank you, this should be up much higher. It is not only the often mentioned making her the butt of of christmas and giving everyone else a laugh when she was apparently very stressed out the whole year. It is also a mysoginist gift. It is disgusting and an ahole move on several levels.", "I don\u2019t know what a case of flowers made of clay is but OP said they gave their sister that too\u2026", "This wasn't an inflatable dinosaur costume or something fun. It was a toilet brush.", "So you habitually give shit presents while presumably she gives you nice presents, otherwise you would've mentioned it. She constantly receives bad gifts from you when she's not into it and she finally snapped. \n\nWhy does it surprise you that she's done with putting up with your shit?", "The subreddit is called \"am *I* the asshole\", not \"is this other person the asshole\". By posting here, he's asking if he's the asshole, even if he doesn't state it outright.", "Yes I'm sure you're such a Nice Guy. Just like OP I'm sure you pretend to be confused when people get upset at you for treating them like shit. Buying your siblings a toilet bowl cleaner with the hopes of making people laugh at her is not a funny/silly move. It's an asshole move, and doubling down and pretending you can't understand why they would be upset makes it so much worse. So nice.", "\u2026 which is useful? OP tried to match it to the bathroom theme and said they got their sister a \u2018case of flowers\u2019 (whatever that is).", "I just watched a YouTube video of a Chinese company that created a personal air bag suit to prevent injuries in elderly people who fell.

Toilet brushes are only useful if you don't already have one. \n\nGetting fun, but useless gifts is still totally different from getting someone a toilet brush.", "A toilet brush is maybe an adequate homewarming gift, but not an appropriate Christmas gift at all. Especially when you got her what sounds like a tacky toilet brush that doesn't sound very ergonomic. You also seem to have set out to make her the butt of a joke, which is shitty.", "I mean I totally see how unwrapping a toilet bowl brush (I assume) could feel like a slap in the face, but it seems like there was thought behind it \n\n> she put a lot of time this year to make her house with her bf \n\n> something funny but also something to use in her new home", "But he\u2019s then upset that she didn\u2019t laugh (because his joke has no humour in it).  Like, how dare she not go along with his plan to make everyone laugh, how very dare she expect a nice, thoughtful gift from him after a hard year. \nIf at any point he expressed remorse that he bought a gift based on making the family as a whole laugh, rather than based on what would the gift recipient enjoy, I might agree. But he doesn\u2019t seem to care that it upset her. If he\u2019s such a people pleaser, where is the care that she\u2019s not happy?", "He didn't say that. He said didn't engage as she was screaming from the moment' she opened the gift. \n\nThey ALL  had a hard year. He said he was trying to Cheer her up too. You keep saying and stuff that directly contradicts the post and his comments. It's like you aren't talking about the same post. \n\nHe does seem to care.  he responded to a grown woman having an entitled tantrum by worrying if he was in the wrong too. That's a people pleaser.", "My biggest issue is that OP said that their sister is \"struggling\" to make her house a home, and is stressed out, and had a hard year last year so they know she's going through some stuff. If her partner isn't helping and making her do all the cleaning having a gift that's based around \"cleaning\" is going to make her feel as if she isn't cleaning her house enough, and that her house is seen as \"dirty\". Not to mention that a lot of people see the woman as the person who has to \"clean the house\", it really wasn't a good gift, their intentions could've been good, but clearly this upset the sister and she has every right to be upset especially about it. \n\nJust because someone is trying to cheer someone up doesn't mean that the other person is obligated to be cheerful, and happy whenever they are clearly going through some stuff. I just hope that this is a learning experience for both of them to do better."]}
