She said love and attention, not money. That means calls, you going to visit her, etc. not just her coming to you when she gets tired of waiting. She specifically told\nYou her needs were emotional not financial and you went \u201cyou don\u2019t need money! Your siblings do.\u201d", "YTA\n\n\nAs you describe it you never offered support after 18. Emotional support is still support. You fo treat her as the least favorit child.\n\n\nAlso- buying your daughter a wedding dress or something similar is about the sentimental value and not the money.", "YTA for thinking that financial support is the only support that matters. Zoe doesn't need money, but it doesn't mean she doesn't need anything.", "INFO: How much more was Lizzie given in the will and why? And how often do you talk to Zoe?", "I don't think you're an AH neceasarily, but I would be willing to bet she feels forgotten because she is more stable and independent, especially since she is saying her wife's family is closer. She may just want more attention for lack of a better word.", "YTA\n\nThe family dynamic I grew up in was similar. My parents were the worst off financially so they received help from my grandparents from time to time. \n\nBut my grandparents always looked for ways to make it up to my mother\u2019s siblings. They would go so far at times to say that even tho they didn\u2019t need the money they were happy to help them financially to pay for a babysitter or send one of us kids some extra cash when we were in uni. Most importantly they reminded all their children that if they ever needed anything all they had to do was ask. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like you ever offered the option to your child which makes you an asshole. \n\nYour kid who has received no financial support in adulthood feels othered by their family because you never had an honest conversation with them about it", "YTA and so was your late husband. You have damage control you need to take care of, if you want a relationship with your daughter Zoe. In the will way give one sister more then the other sister?.", "Yta. You admit you treat them differently, then complain when it's noticed you treat them differently", "YTA - you played favourites and got called out on it. Stop giving excuses and own up to it.", "YTA\n\n1. Why was there unfair distribution of will?\n2. Why didn't you keep in contact with her after she moved out?", "Soft Yta I don't think you did it intentionally but she feels neglected.  I understand  that she is well off and didn't need the same help but that doesn't mean she should get less attention.  Try to apologize and maybe plan to spend a week with just her and doing stuff together if possible. Even if it's simple going out to dinner and chatting.", "YTA you had ample opportunity to show her the same love, but failed to do so.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What about the first 18 years of her life? Listen to your daughter, she\u2019s trying to tell you something.", "wow typical favouritism of others and leave one out no wonder she hasn't contacted you. just because her wife's wealthy. that's her wife's money not hers but you don't care you prefer the other 2 daughters because they live beside you and your younger daughter doesn't", "I was going to say TA, but with the entire story, NAH\n\nHow well did you stay with Zoey in contact via calls, messages, email? \n\nMy sister and I are in contact with our mother but on different levels: while my sister lives further away than I, she also texts and calls her on the regular. I do not, but if I call her, I'm doing very long talks. Any outsider might think my sister and mother have a better bond than I and my mom do but it's not the case", "NAH - COMUNICATE!!! \nI know it's clich\u00e9, but this sounds like a classic case of misunderstood Lovelanguage to me. \nMaybe call up your daughter or invite her out to coffee if she's still around, say that you are sorry for hurting her and ask, what exactly she is missing from you in the relationship. \nIt might very well not be the money per se, but the regularity in which the siblings are asked, how their fairing vs. her (with the presumption, that everything is fine, since she married someone well off). Maybe she interprets the money gifts as little pick-me-up presents, that she's missing out on. \nMaybe she is just frustrated at the situation it self, since she can't spend as much regular time with you. \nThen find a way to show her your love in the way she needs (regular pick-me-up postcard? Regular zoom calls? A daytrip with just you two? Picking up some childhood hobby?)\n\nAdjust your communication and relationship to the circumstances and see, if it makes her feel more appreciate.", "Info: what difference of money are we talking about? \n\nMy orginal thought was kinda yta for not giving her money while giving the others money. Hiwever, this depends on the difference of money given. Of course you can change the amount of things and take your kids specific needs into account, but giving her significantly less (money) just because you don't seem to like her wife and because she moved away is an asshole move imo. (One of my siblings moved continents and my parents still support them. So it is very much possible!)", "NAH. You aren't TA for treating your children according to their different needs - but now you know Zoe needs to feel included, cared about, and considered equally to her siblings. Adjust your interactions with her accordingly.", "NTA. From your description she is overreacting. Just because her life went good for her and she didnt need you financially doesnt mean that you dont love her. But maybe talk to her again about it. In my opinion there has to be more than just the money factor.", "NAH -  Your not a mind reader unless asked for you would not know .Maybe make an effort to go visit her tho.", "NAH.  Adult children always see things differently, especially when it comes to money.", "NTA thy being is angered", "NTA for treating your children differently based on their _perceived_ needs. The question remains if you perceived their needs correctly. The way to find out now would be to ask, since it doesn't seem obvious to you. I am not saying it should. There are other things than money at play in this world, surprisingly enough. Maybe there is some support she really needs that you haven't even thought of. Other than that, you treat children differently because they are indeed different, so in order to be fair, you don't give everybody the same, that goes for money, attention etc. but not for love.", "Either a very very soft YTA or NTA. It\u2019s very understandable that Zoe would feel as if you loved her less but from your point of view she didn\u2019t need help, that help being perceived as love in her eyes. If you said sorry I didn\u2019t intend to hurt you but I can see how our actions may have made you feel that way it\u2019s definitely a NTA. If you didn\u2019t do that it\u2019s the soft YTA."]}
