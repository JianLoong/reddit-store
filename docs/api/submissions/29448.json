If they grow up and want religion, I will 100% support that, but I will not allow my in laws to push their religion on my kids until then. \n\nDo you give them other information that goes against the Bible? Anything like science or exposure to other beliefs? \n\nBasically, what you guys have done is force religion and are saying you will later give them the option of opting out.", "The thing is, at those ages, kids only know what they are taught by those around them. So if they grow up from a young age with religion and going to church, they're going to accept that as the norm and think it's what they want. Whereas if you waited until they were old enough to make those decisions, the they could research on their own, experience in their own, decide on their own,  and so forth.", "I agree with you. Not having them go doesn\u2019t give them the background and perspective to make their decision later. Since you and he did agree on this at the start of your marriage, I\u2019d be inclined to go, and you can talk to your children about different faiths and no faiths, and your husband can talk about his faith, to give them a rounded perspective. \n\nYou won\u2019t get a balanced set of viewpoints here.", "Aww, thanks. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t take it harshly. Now that I am older, I realize the time you have with your kids is truly short. It won\u2019t be long before they are grown and on their own. Give them all the best tools to cope with life you can. I hope you find answers and peace in whatever path you choose for yourself. I personally believe life would be much harder without my faith in God and I am grateful my parents introduced me to religion when I was young. A church can provide so many friends and social activities for children too.", "[deleted]", "No, not at that age. I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want to go to school either - some stuff you don\u2019t get to make your own decisions on until later.", "Religion is a personal choice and everyone has their own relationship. You need to have a sit down conversation with your husband about how you feel and be very respectful. Having your children go before they are able to make up their minds is not a bad thing. They should also be able to choose what they want when they are old enough. Lutheran is similar to catholic but not as strict.", "Being indoctrinated into believing in a God when you are little is not appropriate and do not twist it,  religion is indoctrination!", "At 9 years old, they are old enough. At that age, their basic feelings about things like religion begin to develop. So forcing them could cause them to resent it. \n\nA better idea might be for dad to take them to different church's with different Sunday School type programs.", "Well, school isn't optional. Religion is. It's a personal choice to participate. If someone doesn't want to you shouldn't force it. I've seen tons of kids build resentment for their parents this way.", "By 9 I\u2019m guessing the child has already made their first communion and understands enough to know if they want to continue. The dad probably wants them to get confirmed to finish out their religious experience.", "I remember when I was 10 I discovered that people at the church actually believed everything said there was true, and was absolutely baffled. I thought everybody was just playing along with it", "I\u2019m a boomer so I am going to think a bit differently as religion was a bigger deal in society in general when I was young. My extended family has both very religious people - served as missionaries - and complete atheists. \n\nFor me and my brother, our non-religious parents came to us back in the late sixties and said, we don\u2019t believe ourselves but we want you to understand what Christianity is, and you can make up your minds when you\u2019re older. I\u2019d say we were about six and eight. We got sent to Sunday school! ( United Church of Canada, very liberal. ) It was just down the street so we didn\u2019t need parents dropping us off or anything. \n\nWe were a bit baffled at the time but after a few months our parents quizzed us about what we had learned and said, ok, kids, we\u2019re satisfied you understand enough now, you can stop going. Much to their bafflement we said no, we want to keep going, and we continued until we moved from that neighbourhood a couple of years later. To this day we both have faith there\u2019s something bigger than us, and we enjoy singing \u201cI Cannot Come to the Banquet\u201d together.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the bad way too - the very religious family members insisting their older teenagers attend church. My niece was talking about religious trauma and that\u2019s definitely a thing. I also have a close friend who, although a believer, had an interesting teenagerhood as her father insisted on attending the very early service with the entire family every single time instead of the 10 am service. No sleeping in on Sunday ever!\n\nI think that while nine years old is old enough that you\u2019re starting to formulate your own ideas about things, it\u2019s too young to opt out of what your parent wants you to participate in for your own improvement unless that thing is morally distressing. For instance, if the Dad\u2019s hobby is hiking, the nine year old should hike. If the family hobby is hunting, a nine year old should be able to say no, I don\u2019t want to go kill things. \n\nI think I\u2019d say about 13 or 14 is the age when you can opt out - by that time you should have reasoned out your beliefs and be able to defend them."]}
