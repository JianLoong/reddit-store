I thought everybody was just playing along with it", "I\u2019m a boomer so I am going to think a bit differently as religion was a bigger deal in society in general when I was young. My extended family has both very religious people - served as missionaries - and complete atheists. \n\nFor me and my brother, our non-religious parents came to us back in the late sixties and said, we don\u2019t believe ourselves but we want you to understand what Christianity is, and you can make up your minds when you\u2019re older. I\u2019d say we were about six and eight. We got sent to Sunday school! ( United Church of Canada, very liberal. ) It was just down the street so we didn\u2019t need parents dropping us off or anything. \n\nWe were a bit baffled at the time but after a few months our parents quizzed us about what we had learned and said, ok, kids, we\u2019re satisfied you understand enough now, you can stop going. Much to their bafflement we said no, we want to keep going, and we continued until we moved from that neighbourhood a couple of years later. To this day we both have faith there\u2019s something bigger than us, and we enjoy singing \u201cI Cannot Come to the Banquet\u201d together.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the bad way too - the very religious family members insisting their older teenagers attend church. My niece was talking about religious trauma and that\u2019s definitely a thing. I also have a close friend who, although a believer, had an interesting teenagerhood as her father insisted on attending the very early service with the entire family every single time instead of the 10 am service. No sleeping in on Sunday ever!\n\nI think that while nine years old is old enough that you\u2019re starting to formulate your own ideas about things, it\u2019s too young to opt out of what your parent wants you to participate in for your own improvement unless that thing is morally distressing. For instance, if the Dad\u2019s hobby is hiking, the nine year old should hike. If the family hobby is hunting, a nine year old should be able to say no, I don\u2019t want to go kill things. \n\nI think I\u2019d say about 13 or 14 is the age when you can opt out - by that time you should have reasoned out your beliefs and be able to defend them.", "Perhaps a controversial take- but if you want them to make their own decisions, why are you indoctrinating them/allowing them to be indoctrinated at a young, incredibly impressionable age?
