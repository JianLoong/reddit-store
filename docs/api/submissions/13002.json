It's not even about the sexual aspect here. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your room with someone then you're just not comfortable.", "NTA He's basically a stranger. Why doesn't she share her room with him?", "NTA. Your mother\u2019s compassion for Mark is admirable. If only it extended to her own child. I\u2019m assuming she knows about your trauma. For her to dismiss it like that is odd, and hard to square with her attitude towards Mark. Surely, she has at least as much obligation to you as to Mark, and her disregard of her plan\u2019s risks for you, particularly when other viable options are available, is confusing.  As is her implicit assumption that all young people will have sex with each other, if and only if sexual orientations align.", "Oof. Your mom is a caring person, but she is in the wrong here. Even if you didn't have traumas involving men, it wouldn't be okay to have you share your room with a guy, and sexuality has nothing to do with it. Plus I think Mark would equally be uncomfortable sharing a room with you. So while I applaud your mom for not letting him go homeless, you're NTA. I hope you can come to a solution that is good for everyone.", "NTA\n\nRegardless of sexuality or gender your mother wants you to share an intimate space where you will be unconscious and sometimes naked with a relative stranger that you know very little about. Not reasonable at all.\n\nIf it's no big deal she can share with Mark....", "NTA. You have a very good reason for wanting this boundary. \n\nYes, it is unlikely (even if he was straight or whatever) that something will happen. but you have trauma. It IS likely your PTSD will act up. Youre listening to your body and are trying to manage your mental health. It will be hard for you to sleep and relax sharing a room.\n\nYou have a right to say no. You didnt do anything wrong by that. It isnt like you are insisting he be homeless, you are offering other potential solutions.\n\nA man being gay doesnt mean they cant possibly harm you in some way, and btw someone being a woman doesnt mean they are necessarily safe; him being gay also doesnt mean he cant sleep in a room with another man without \"something happening\" so if anything I really question that assumption. I think your Mom is in the wrong on this one.", "NTA.  Your brother is moving out at the end of April and Mark's parents are kicking him out in three weeks. That means that there will only be a week or two where Mark would have to sleep on the couch. It's really nice that she wants to help this boy out, but her own children's comfort and safety come first.  She is being unreasonable.", "NTA \nYour mom would be better off ensuring that her children are flourishing rather than rushing off to help somebody else's child to the detriment of her own. She seems to be diminishing your trauma. And to be honest she sounds like she may be homophobic seeing as she doesn't want Mark sharing with your brother.", "NTA, you deserve your privacy / personal space. Especially if you have trauma. Your brother deserves his privacy too, of course. \nIn my opinion, it's not kindness / generosity if you take from someone to give to someone else. You mother should think again - it's an emergency/temporary solution, I think the couch is fine. \n(Also, that thing about him being gay and sleeping in your brother's room being impossible is a very weird statement, it's not because you're in the same room as someone that you'd want to sleep with them??)", "NTA, maybe the mother should consider sharing to her room with him, instead of making her daughter uncomfortable. I mean even if she was not gay or did not have trauma, Op still has the right to her boundaries.", "NTA\n\nEven without your trauma it's reasonable for you to not want to share a room with a teenager you barely know of a different gender to yours. His sexuality is really irrelevant. The lack of sexual attraction doesn't negate the need for privacy.", "NTA.  It's great that your mother wants to offer a home to a gay teen who is being thrown out of his parents' house, but it's not ok to force you to share a room with him.  \n\nIf your mother won't let Mark share your brother's room for another month, Mark will just have to sleep in the living room.  You are old enough to have a say in who shares your bedroom.", "NTA. You would be if him being gay were the reason you didn't want to share a room, but it's not and the reason you do have is absolutely more than valid. \n\nIt's super great that your mom wants to open your home to someone who needs the safety net, but significantly less great that she wants to impose upon one of her kids to do so and especially since she (I assume) knows about your PTSD. Why doesn't *she* share a room with Mark, if it's so not a big deal?", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry your mom is being so callous. It's great that she's helping Mark out, but that shouldn't come at the expense of her own child's feelings of safety in your own home! Especially considering your brother is fine with Mark bunking with him, this makes zero sense. And her rationale for *not* letting Mark stay in his room makes even less sense -- if Mark is gay and your brother isn't, \"nothing\" is going to happen between them, either! Maybe your brother can speak bluntly with your mom and this can work out safely for everyone? This is ridiculous, OP, and I'm sorry you're being put through it.", "Interesting. Your mom has a bit of unconscious bias going on there. It's kind of her to want to help, but your trauma vs sharing short term with hetero brother who's fine with it? No contest. NTA.", "NTA\n\nTake all the gay/straight out of it.  Even with us recognizing gender is more fluid than before, it still very unreasonable to ask someone to share a room with someone that makes them uncomfortable.  If you were coming from a place of bigotry or ignorance, it might change my opinion, but everyone is entitled to their emotions and personal feelings.  \n\nI wouldn't feel super comfortable sharing my room with a relatively unknown person.  If your brother is good with it, problem solved.  If your mom is worried about the two banging, whatever, get over it.", "NTA. it\u2019s YOUR room, and not feeling comfortable enough to share it with someone else is valid. Your mom saying that she doesn\u2019t want him to share a room with your brother is quite homophobic, just because he\u2019s gay doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll do anything to any man he sees", "nta\n\nher complete disregard for your trauma aside, everyone deserves privacy and i dont really follow your mothers logic. you are not interested in guys and neither is your brother but its somehow ok for Mark to share a room with you but not your brother?\n\nso it sounds like she subconsciously thinks that Mark is some sort of predator and since you dont fall into his prey category, you have to share your room. thats absolutely insane.\n\nput your foot down, tell her she is free to share her room with Mark or Mark can camp out for a couple of weeks on the couch until your brother moves out.", "NTA. It\u2019s inappropriate for your mother to expect you to share a room with a stranger - gay, straight, male, female or otherwise. The fact you have trauma to do with men is even more reprehensible of your mother. Your reaction has nothing to do with Mark as a person and your mum needs to stop brushing off your very valid feelings.", "NTA.\n\nAt it's core, this is your mom basically telling you she's taking away half your space and basically all your privacy. Male/Female/Gay/Hetero/Whatever Else is not the issue.\n\nIf mom wants him to move in to someone's room, make it hers.", "your mom has no respect for her children to let a stranger live in her home. keep fighting for you own room, he can sleep on the couch.", "NTA. Your mom is being totally unreasonable and disrespectful of your issues. Tell her, \"If Mark's going to be in my room, then _**I'll**_ sleep on the couch!\"", "NTA - Your mom was kind to help Mark but you dont have the obligation to share a room with him", "NTA\n\nUntil you added context I was thinking you shouldn't have to share a room with someone who is effectively a stranger.  However when you mentioned you were female and your past trauma it you are definitely NTA.  \n\nHe may be a really nice guy but your mum asking him to share a room with you is not ok and can't understand why she wouldn't want him to share with your brother who is ok with it.", "NTA\n\nyour mom is the asshole even though she is doing a kind thing for someone. She is taking him in since his parents are homophobic, but she is displaying the same thing by refusing letting him stay with your straight brother.", "NTA it is entirely inappropriate to expect you to be okay with sharing your room with 1) any man, gay or straight 2) someone you don't even know.  Put your foot down as much as you possibly can. This is not okay.", "NTA\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t think Mark is a bad person and \u2018nothing\u2019s gonna happen\u2019 why won\u2019t she let him share with your brother?", "No, no, no. NTA. So your mom doesn\u2019t trust him enough to be in a room with your straight 18 y.o. brother but is okay with the two of you being alone? She either trusts him or she doesn\u2019t! The simple fact that he\u2019s a stranger should be more than enough explanation for not wanting to share a room with him. I appreciate her compassion but she needs to work out the logistics.", "NTA\n\nYou are not required to share your room with anyone. There is a reasonable amount of space in your home to have the guest sleep somewhere else, your mother\u2019s position seems as avoidable as it is unreasonable.", "NTA !!! at your age unless you are 10000% comfortable sharing with anyone (let alone someone of the opposite gender) you shouldn\u2019t have to. especially since he is a stranger", "ESH- asking your bro to share a room with him if it was a woman how would you feel? How would his girlfriend feel? Put that into perspective. You said ok before thinking it through. Admit & Apologize for that before beginning the next conversation!\n\nStaying on the couch offers him zero privacy and you state you are a lesbian with trauma around men but these things don\u2019t go hand in hand - SO EITHER a) your exaggerating or b) your mother isn\u2019t sufficiently informed about your trauma and how you\u2019re dealing with it. If you were abused in some way then that should be the only focus here and you should also be in therapy. \n\nSharing a room with the person he isn\u2019t sexually attracted to makes complete sense. It\u2019s either that or the couch- if you have good reason to send him there. There is no world where he should be sharing a room with the person he could potentially be fantasizing about. You agreed without thinking it through so now that you have done so you need to examine your reasons and take a hard look at them, discuss any LEGIT, non exaggerated reasons with your mom and if they really are trauma based offer the couch or find him another place to stay.\n\nI would say YtA but I\u2019m saying ESH because this should have been clarified by ALL parties inc your mom BEFORE agreeing.", "TA. We have all experienced trauma -I was molested by family member. You paying rent and board? Start, and you may have a valid argument. We need to support one another in the community. Imagine if you weren\u2019t blessed with awesome parents, and stuck with his? You\u2019re 17, you should be planning on leaving the nest soon. You sound entitled and cold. This whole story reads to me a one long passive aggressive \u201cpity me life isn\u2019t exactly how I want.\u201d  Working in behavioral health, trauma seems to be getting overused. It\u2019s an emotional weapon to gaslight those around you into  agreeing with your side. If you\u2019re going to survive the world being in the LGBTQ+ community in this day and age -you need to thicken your skin up. Still don\u2019t like your mom\u2019s request? Emancipate yourself.

Regardless of orientation - that\u2019s asking a lot (a lot that, if your mother wants to provide, she could easily take that burden on herself). \n\nSome personal background - in my mid 20\u2019s a lesbian friend of mine got kicked out of her parents house for similar reasons. With nowhere to go she stayed with me for a while until she could reliably live on her own. I gave her my room and just slept on my (very comfortable) couch because even as a man I felt odd about the lack of mutual privacy. Your mom has options, virtually all of them better than the one she\u2019s trying to force on you.", "NTA. Sexual orientations are completely irrelevant here. You should not have to share your bedroom with someone that you do not feel comfortable with. Especially someone who is basically a stranger.", "NTA. I don't care that you're both gay, it's inappropriate for opposite sex teens to share a room. You need privacy and your brother is fine sharing.\n\nMom might claim not to be homophobic but apparently she thinks Mark is irresistible and will turn your brother gay.", "Leave it to Reddit to equate trauma with bigotry. \ud83d\ude12", "Btw implying that it is experience related you play into every right wing lunatic trying to say it\u2019s a choice and a lifestyle caused by trauma and therapy to work through it will allow you to leave the attraction behind. Think before you speak, because this kind of thinking makes YTA", "I didn\u2019t say mutually exclusive, I said they don\u2019t go hand in hand- meaning just because you\u2019re a lesbian doesn\u2019t mean you have trauma around men. These things do not go hand in hand. Don\u2019t put words in my mouth. I\u2019m proudly part of the LGBTQ+ community and while there are people \u201csocialized\u201d to be same sex attracted due to traumatic experiences, the majority of people dont choose it, don\u2019t have a say in it, and their attraction is how they are BORN and who they ARE - having absolutely zero to do with their experiences after birth.", "Yea her daughter was traumatized by men before she was 12 and she wants to force her to share a room. I'd feel guilty I couldn't protect my child even if it wasn't my fault. What good parent even thinks retraumatising their child is ok? \n\nShe isn't a caring person at all to her child and she a bigot to boot - why can't a straight and gay person  share a room? Sexuality isn't transmitted by proximity", "Are you saying they\u2019re mutually exclusive? There was a post a few weeks ago where the OP refused to get in a vehicle with a woman driver because of a traumatic event that happened when he was a child, and he was almost universally deemed TA and sexist for his views.", "Implying that it\u2019s an experience that makes one lesbian or gay? Where did you get this in what OP wrote or what I wrote?\n\nEdited to add: what you\u2019re accusing (someone?) of isn\u2019t a position I hold, nor do I get that interpretation from the OP\u2019s writing.", "Ok, fair enough. It wasn\u2019t my intent to twist your words, and I see the difference. Regardless, though, OP is not claiming they go hand in hand, only that she is a lesbian and that she has trauma with men. I\u2019m also part of the LGBTQ+ community. I have no trouble with the idea that most are born as they are and not socialized into their orientation or gender identity. That part of your advocacy isn\u2019t in opposition to me.", "I don't see where anyone has called Mark a monster or even insinuated it (not saying it isn't there somewhere, I haven't read every comment). But he is most definitely a stranger to OP and her mom has no business insisting one of her kids share a bedroom with him, especially the one who is distinctly not OK with it. It wouldn't matter to me if it was a straight girl, mom is completely wrong to try and force a stranger of any kind into her kid's bedroom. Her obligation is to HER child, not someone else's. I think it's great she's willing to take Mark in, but horrible that she's trying to force someone OP is not comfortable with into the personal space that is her bedroom. She's too interested in making up for where Mark's parents lost the plot on parenting that she's failing her own kid in a big way. You appear to be transferring your own twisted up views or past experiences into the situation when it wasn't implied by OP or anyone else."]}
