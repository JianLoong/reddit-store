I only want attention and care that is freely and enthusiastically given.  It would make me feel pitiful to have my birthday only be recognized because I demanded it, I'd rather he forget completely then give me some sort of resentful, half assed celebration that I demanded he do.", "INFO: Is the art exhibit something that'd normally interest him, or was his tagging along clearly more about keeping you company?", "Either he's lying about his back and he's a massive asshole, or you are being dismissive of a real limiting thing and are yourself a massive asshole.\n\nIt's either NTA or YTA.

Was it a morning or afternoon event?\n\nIf it was a couple of hours in the morning NTA for expecting something to have been planned like you discussed. If it was the afternoon, I\u2019d say soft YTA because it\u2019s so hard to plan something worthy of a bday when you have an event mid-day.\n\nNow, your husband throwing out his back is no joke. I understand if he had planned something, but couldn\u2019t go through with it that day given his pain. However, based on your post it sounds like he took the tickets as an easy-out not to plan anything for your bday and didn\u2019t have a plan to do  as a makeup when he feels better.\n\nInfo on timing and duration of the event would help  with a vote.", "You made an issue of him planning the day, then accepted tickets that would consume most of the day.

His attitude sounded really crappy, but it's kind of whack that you expected him to do MORE events with you after the exhibit with a thrown-out back. Those are no joke.", "YTA. Did you once consider how he felt? This post comes across as extremely selfish on your part. Birthdays don\u2019t always have to be celebrated on the day of. And so what if it was bad? Things happen.

It\u2019s just a birthday. It\u2019s not even a decade, like your 30th or 40th, just a regular birthday. \n\nIf something happens on your birthday, that\u2019s great. If it\u2019s the same day as any other, that\u2019s called being an adult. To expect your boyfriend to do anything at all is a little much, but to expect him to do it twice? That\u2019s a huge red flag. Poor guy just needed to rest his back. Would you ever give him two birthdays?", "He planned a wonderful event and you should be grateful.

Can we celebrate next weekend instead?\"\n\nBut he didn't do any of that. He played video games.", "Discuss a gift that was for her birthday? \n\nDiscuss whether he was ok with her birthday presents?", "Yes so excruciating that only playing video games can help alleviate them.  /s obv", "Then he should have asked for a rain check and actually planned something for when his back feels better.

If a man says he will plan something for your birthday, it could be any day.  Literally any  day. Just keep waiting.  I\u2019m sure it coming.

I guess part of my response is personal. I LOVE planning things for people\u2019s bdays and celebrating them. Even if it\u2019s \u201csomething little\u201d I\u2019ll plan a park day and pack a lunch and bring a board game or cards. Or I\u2019ll make a nice dinner and plan a movie with snacks and blankets. Like seriously I love making people feel special. But a mid-day change of plans will throw all of it off. OPs bf definitely doesn\u2019t sound like that though. Maybe I\u2019m too nice and give the benefit of the doubt too much.", "She asked him to plan the day.
