If it\u2019s an ex: does this person have a tendency to overly commit to their relationships? Does this person makes impulsive decisions? Is this a personality trait that I haven\u2019t been exposed to? If she was once THAT serious about this person, does it mean there are residual feelings?\n\nAnd the same works the other way around: if you tattooed your ex\u2019s name for whatever reason, and if you deeply regret it when the relationship was over, you can feel you\u2019ll be judged for this decision. IMO, they don't know a lot about each other yet, they're still tiptoeing around some things, and it can lead them to hang onto things that they feel are important to better understand each other.\n\nEdit to add: OP assuming the tattoo could refer to him because he has the same name shows how little he still knows about her (\"is she the kind of person that throws herself into a relationship that quick?\"); so everything in those early stages can lead someone to reach certain conclusions, especially because they don't really know each other.", "I mean\u2026technically, she wouldn\u2019t *have* to ever explain it, but I (and I think most people) would find it exceptionally odd for someone I was in a long term relationship with to refuse to share the meaning of something they felt strongly enough about to permanently ink on their body.", "1.

Next time try reading, I know it\u2019s hard.", "Sounds like you\u2019ve got low value there bro, hope it works out.", "Lmao you can say it\u2019s not but I can say it is \ud83e\udd23", "Sounds like you\u2019ve got some stuff in your past you\u2019re ashamed about - I\u2019ve seen you all throughout this thread coping and seething. Choices have consequences, maybe should have thought about that before doing dumb shit.", "It's like seeing someone leave their private journal on the table and deciding that because it's left out, you can just go and leaf through it like the nosy arsehole with boundary issues you are. Did their parents not teach them not to pry?", "This is the most sensible answer I've gotten yet and I thank you for that.", "Whatever. I'm getting bad vibes from this girl. Good luck OP.", "That would be a smart move on his part \ud83d\udea9", "There is ONE (1) thing this person is not willing to tell (yet) to a person they are dating for a month. Not anything, not loads, ONE thing. Chill", "Sounds like he pressed her a little bit, which I think is justified given that it is his name, but then let it go. I don\u2019t think that makes him TA.", "Just go over the second para again.", "Depends on hair style and length/weight. It's also not anyone's business what meaning a person's tattoos have, and the assumption that someone having one on thier neck is an idiot or that refusing to tell the meaning of one to someone you've known for at most a month is 'hiding something', then you're more of a judgemental jackass than OP.", "It\u2019s more of being worried that they could potentially be that extreme to get your name tatted that fast, rather than \u201cthinking you\u2019re that important\u201d", "uuuuh or maybe - nah just kidding won\u2019t do it", "The story is private - just because it's visible doesn't automatically grant anyone who asks the right to the story behind it.", "Covered by her hair.", "I have tattoos that mean a lot to me too. You can see the tattoo but you're not entitled to knowing the meaning of it. That is for me and me alone. Just like I owe no one any explanation about my scars, accidental ot deliberate, self-inflicted or given to me.", "This", "I also got a Matt vibe from this.", "I may be biased by my own experiences, but to me, it\u2019s giving Ryan.  Or maybe George.", "Lol \u201clow value\u201d, cringe. It\u2019s called having a brain and not having main character syndrome. It works out fine thanks.", "You\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s like to be in a relationship much less a healthy marriage. You\u2019re hardly the expert.", "You have every right to have that black and white thinking.", "Lmfao I\u2019m not ashamed of anything. \ud83d\ude06 Sounds like you\u2019re coping with no one being interested in creating a past with you.", "Bad vibes. You don't even know her, but you trust OP's unerliable narration wholly. Talk about bad vibes.", "That's certainly possible. Although, I think that's a little dramatic over a tattoo on someone you've been dating for a month. Personally, I'd keep it going if it's good. It's not like you can't leave later.", "It\u2019s not justified because it\u2019s not a new tattoo. It\u2019s several years old. And given her age is so young even now, it was clearly done as a teenager or just barely out. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Failing to pick up hints is not the same as pushing forward after being told it\u2019s none of his business. He only did one of those things.", "Whatever helps you sleep at night loser", "Logic and sense seems to be taking a severe beating today smh", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
