If it\u2019s an ex: does this person have a tendency to overly commit to their relationships? Does this person make impulsive decisions? Is this a personality trait that I haven\u2019t been exposed to? If she was once THAT serious about this person, does it mean there are residual feelings?\n\nAnd the same works the other way around: if you tattooed your ex\u2019s name for whatever reason, and if you deeply regret it when the relationship was over, you can feel you\u2019ll be judged for this decision. IMO, they don't know a lot about each other yet, they're still tiptoeing around some things, and it can lead them to hang onto things that they feel are important to better understand each other.\n\nEdit to add: OP assuming the tattoo could refer to him because he has the same name shows how little he still knows about her (\"is she the kind of person that throws herself into a relationship that quick?\"); so everything in those early stages can lead someone to reach certain conclusions, especially because they don't really know each other.", "I mean\u2026technically, she wouldn\u2019t *have* to ever explain it, but I (and I think most people) would find it exceptionally odd for someone I was in a long term relationship with to refuse to share the meaning of something they felt strongly enough about to permanently ink on their body.", "1.
