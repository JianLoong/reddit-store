I know this is causing you grief, but find peace in that you're surrounding yourself with so many other people who love you and care about you.\n\nYou don't invite people who hurt you.

In other words, limit exposure to them. You have every right to and actually need to do this in order to secure your future healthy union with your partner. You can be free to be: HAPPY!", "NTA. You don\u2019t need any reasons to not invite somebody to your wedding. You don\u2019t want him there? Ok so that\u2019s it.

Of course you don\u2019t want someone who is mentally/emotionally abusive at your wedding.  You\u2019d be completely justified in cutting off all contact with someone who treats you this way and with your mother for staying married to him.

But there simply isn't enough time to even make a dent in something so complex between now and the wedding. **It's time for OP to worry about herself and not them**\n\nYou're absolutely right that she cannot accept any money from them, and probably not even a gift. Counseling ***is*** a good idea, but not for all of them. The counseling should focus on helping OP deal with her guilt and realize she is in no way an a-hole", "Group counseling with abusive or gaslighting people is usually also not a good idea because they get the chance to get their hurtful content to spill again and the use it to deepen their belief if the opposing party is weakened by their mistreatment.\n\nThe best way to get better is to cut contact with these people, or draw a hard line and don't discuss this anymore. This would be OP saying \"the husband is not coming to my wedding, this is the final decision.\". And then stop all attempts at talking about the reasons, or negotiating. Block messages. The discussions are a continuation of the abuse and the abused person will never will by trying to reason with the abuser.", "NTA \n\nYou decide whom to invite to your wedding or not. Do not let yourself get dragged into arguments. All they will achieve is that you'll feel awful while the status quo will not have changed. \n\nYou have made your decision to not invite him, so don't invite him, don't accept any calls from him and immediately shut down any conversation about his relationship with you without engaging (hang up or walk away if you must).", "Don't invite either of them.", "You need to go no contact with both of them.

Maybe consider not inviting her either, she stayed with a man that was bullying you", "NTA\n\nNo one should have to tolerate that kind of behavior.\n\n It's sad that as a child, you didn't feel your mom would listen to you, so you kept that awful statement to yourself. But, clearly you were right about how she'd react. Don't punish yourself into thinking it would've been any different had you brought this up 10 years ago.\n\nIt's tough to stand up for yourself, but at some point you need to prioritize yourself. I went through something similar at my own wedding, and I didn't regret not inviting my abuser. As a matter of fact, I'm proud. Yes, there was some backlash, but whatever. At some point you need to get mad for yourself.\n\nYour mom might not go. Don't be shocked, considering she chose this AH.

It\u2019s your day. If his presence will in some way ruin your day, just ignore anyone who is causing any issue in the planning. Block them on social media if need be, and unblock them close to the wedding date when their opinions cannot affect the day anymore. Obviously they should still be invited, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they need to communicate with you in advance.", "NTA. Never go to therapy with your abuser. Make no mistake, he is an abuser. \n\nPeople always say you can't cut off family but you absolutely can. If they're toxic, cutting them off is healthy. \n\nYou've already taken steps to limit contact with your mum's husband. Give some thought to how much contact you need to eliminate and with whom. After all, your mother has chosen to stay married to a man who told her daughter to kill herself. What do either one of them add to your life other than stress and pain? Think about this and set your boundaries accordingly. \n\nYour mental health is paramount. Do what you need to do to take care of yourself. Good luck!"]}
