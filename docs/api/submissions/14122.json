He told me he understood but not to tell my friend because he wasn\u2019t ready to come out to her. As a gay guy I understood this l, and proceeded to ask my other friend (15 female) for advice.

That kind of message is extremely inappropriate and you are absolutely right that it's not ok for him to be hitting on you while trying to ask someone else out. Prank or no Prank.   \nAlso, that guy was an absolute idiot. What if you had told your friend about the situation before you knew it was a prank? Or told the wrong person about the situation. Considering you had messages as proof and could have put that guy in an incredibly vulnerable position or ruined his reputation. Most girls are going to have zero interest in a guy who flirts with other people while in the process of asking them out.   \nFeel however you want to feel about the situation and if your friends say you're overreacting maybe give those friendships a second thought and consider why they might be acting like that and if those are really the kinds of people you want to be around.", "NTA - The people \"pranking\" you are being mean and dumb.

Obviously the prank was wrong - it wasn\u2019t a prank it was an attempt to humiliate you. There is no way a reasonable person would think this was funny. Now the reason you are included in this is because as far as you knew he came out to you in confidence and you have discussed it with just about everyone. At no point we\u2019re you given permission to share that info. \n\nI\u2019d clarify that - is it possible that it wasn\u2019t a prank and he only said it was because he isn\u2019t ready for the rest of people to know because you outed him?", "NTA when friends think it is funny to hurt and embarrass you and get their kicks from that,then they no longer respect you. Friends don't make fun of their own friends. I had a really bad home life, so I was incredibly fussy about my friends and made sure I was with good ones.", "NTA. He sounds like a tool. \n\nA prank where everyone is laughing is a fine prank. A prank where everybody isn't laughing is bullying in my book.", "NTA. They only played the \u201cit\u2019s a joke\u201d card to avoid feeling guilty for it", "NTA and men always have some kinda come back for when they were rejected. You\u2019re a slag, a lesbian, too fat, ugly, gross, it was a joke, someone paid them to ask you \ud83e\udd71\ud83d\ude34", "NTA, you should ask your \"friends\" to explain the joke to you.", "Nope. \n\nYet another asshole hiding horrible behavior behind \u201cit\u2019s just a prank bro\u201d. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI would make sure that everybody knows that the guy was hitting on you. Add some well chosen screenshots of your conversation floating around. \n\nIt's just a prank...", "NTA. It sounds to me like this person is actually bi or maybe gay and then they made up the idea of a prank after you rejected him and he didn\u2019t want to come out publicly.", "NTA and this kind of \u201cprank\u201d isn\u2019t funny. You could reply back to him saying that nothing about the prank was funny and that you\u2019re done talking with him, then block. You should also show the messages to your friend that he\u2019s talking to", "NTA.  You aren't an asshole for being genuinely upset.  The guy was definitely lying to you about himself, either when he said he was bi, or when you rejected him and he said that he was straight.  Upset is a normal reaction to being deceived.\n\nWith that said, your other friend is right and this isn't that deep.  You encountered a jerk who acted like a jerk because that's what jerks do.  You don't need to feel bad about yourself or that you are in any way wrong just because he was a dick.  As you grow up a few more years the number of guys who will feel inclined to act this way to you will drop sharply AND you will stop caring nearly so much about stuff like this as you get more life experience.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s a social media \u201cinfluencer\u201d who was just randomly \u201cpranking\u201d people at a mall. \nHe ended up being shot because someone found his \u201cprank\u201d not that funny.", "NTA but your friends are TA", "\"it was just a prank bro\" is always used to negate responsibility for someone's shitty actions. Like \"why are you mad I trashed your house? It's a prank! Now you can't be mad at me!\" like no, you're still an asshole and calling it a prank doesn't change that.\n\nNTA", "NTA. A prank is only a prank if it doesnt hurt anyone and is funny to everyone including the pranked person. Otherwise, its just cruelty.", "NTA. He is the AH.", "NTA\n\nIf a prank doesn\u2019t amuse the intended target, then it\u2019s just abuse. \n\nIf you can, go NC with all involved who participated and supported the prank. They\u2019ve shown you who they really are and you should believe them the first time.", "NTA this is giving me serious 6th grade trauma flashbacks those people all suck and your friend should skedaddle for sure"]}
