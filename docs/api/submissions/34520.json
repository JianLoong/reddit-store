My fianc\u00e9 told everyone because it was my birthday I could pick what we do for the night. \n\n Shortly after everyone arrives, me and the other girls talk and decide we want to watch this new movie saltburn, and afterwards we will all play board games as a group. The guys in the group said they didn\u2019t want to watch this movie but instead would go and play their own game in a different room. We said that was completely fine for them to do their own thing and we all agreed we would just all play together when the movie was over.  \n\nSo me and the girls proceed to watch the movie. When the movie is over we go and tell the boys we are done and ready to play with them, as we had agreed earlier and had told them how long the movie would be so they knew how much time they had.\n\nThe boys decided to play monopoly, and while they had been playing while we were watching the movie, they were no where close to the end of the game. We told them we had discussed playing as a group and to please hurry up so we could play a group game together. \nThe boys proceed to play the game for approximately 2 hours longer, ignoring our several attempts to get them to hurry up.By the time they finally finish the game it is close to 2 am. I am exhausted, one of the other girls falls asleep from waiting. We are all clearly irritated, but especially me as we had all agreed to get together as a group for my birthday and it felt like the guys just used my birthday as an excuse for bro time and spent no actual time with me the birthday girl, or their respective girlfriends. Everyone just ended up leaving after this, as it was late and it had began to snow outside. \n\nAt the end of the night I was pretty pissed with my fianc\u00e9 as well as his pals as he and the other guys totally derailed our plans, and I had had bad experiences with birthdays in the past where I wasn\u2019t even sure if I wanted to invite people over and my fianc\u00e9 had convinced me to do it this year and it would be a great time, \n\nI do I could be the asshole for being mad and should be grateful that these people even came and they did bring me small presents as well, aita for being mad about how it went?", "created_utc": 1704617300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190nwyh/aita_for_being_mad_about_how_my_birthday_party/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and the girls could have played your own game when you saw they weren\u2019t even close to finishing up. You give off mega main character vibes. Who cares if it was your birthday, it doesn\u2019t give you the right to demand everyone stop what they\u2019re doing just for you.", "YTA", "I feel like birthdays are that one day where we are allowed to be the center of attention for once, especially during our own party. OP is in her mid twenties and didn't even want to celebrate, being grateful for the few people who came. How sad is that? What happened on the birthdays before? \nNow her fianc\u00e9 convinced her to celebrate, told her she could chose the activity and agreed to join her after the movie. That was the deal. And then he broke it on a day he convinced her to make about herself for once. So why make promises and her hopes up in the first place? That's just cruel. NTA", "She\u2019s allowed to tell people what to do when it\u2019s her party. This is like saying u are giving main character vibe because nobody else is allowed to wear white or be more flashy than u at you own wedding.
