On top of that you didn't leave her without a pan in the meantime, you just provided pans she doesn't like.

However, I will say that for someone who doesn't know how to cook, cast iron will likely make her not want to anymore.\n\nSure, cast iron gives a great crust and can become almost fully nonstick if you season it enough (I have eight layers of seasoning on mine), but it's also a friggin pain in the ass to use and needs even more babying than nonstick.
