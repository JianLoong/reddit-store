But anything more complicated like a fried egg is hard for her.  \n\nI have silicone rubber utensils that I use on my non stick pans.  It's great.  Clean up is so easy.  \n\nShe took about two weeks to destroy all my non stick pans.  She uses forks or a metal spatula to move and scrape the food. \n\nI had taken the time to show her how to use the non stick stuff. I had shown her where all.the utensils were.  Didn't matter. She scraped off the non stick coating.  \n\nSo all the food she was making was sticking to the pan.  I have no idea how but she managed to stick a grilled cheese sandwich to the pan.  \n\nShe wants me to replace the pans. So I did. I pulled my cast iron out of the garage.  I cleaned it really well and then I seasoned it all to make it non stick.  I also bought a bunch of those cloth covers for the handle so she doesn't burn herself. \n\nShe is mad at me for making her use cast iron like little house on the prairie. I told her if she wants she can purchase her own pans to cook in.  But that since I don't like flakes of Teflon in my food I won't eat any of it.  \n\nShe said she didn't damage my pans.  So I let her buy one.  Then I made bacon and a Spanish fried egg in it.  Then I wiped it clean with some paper towel and showed her the pan.   \n\nShe had scraped off the coating in a couple of weeks.  \n\nNow she is worried about all the Teflon she is consuming.  She went over to her parents and asked her mom how she never scratched up the pans.  Her mom showed her the silicone utensils she has.  \n\nShe says that if I replace the pans she promises to use the proper utensils.  I offered to pay for half.  \n\nShe said I was being a cheap asshole. \n\nOh yeah before I post she is a full grown 26 year old adult.

Her mom showed her the silicone utensils she has.\r  \n\r\n\nSo you told and showed your GF that she was doing a basic household chore in a manner that, to put it bluntly, was wrong.  She was completely closed off to the possibility that she was wrong and was unwilling to consider that your opinion might be the correct one.  But, once her mommy showed your GF she was wrong she was willing to accept that she had, in fact, destroyed the non-stick pans.\n\n**So your opinions about basic life skills don't count while her mother's word is gospel?!?**  I hope I am interpreting this situation incorrectly.", "NTA.\n\nIt's ridiculous that everyone knows you don't put metal in the microwave, but can't figure that out for non-stick coatings.\n\nBesides putting all the non-stick utensils on display and hiding all the metal stuff, you also need to teach her that the burner knobs have settings other than \"high\" or \"off.\"", "NTA. You were very generous to offer to pay for half, since you already warned her, this shouldn\u2019t be new information, and she\u2019s the one that screwed them up in the first place.\n\nF non-stick pans though, cast iron all the way.", "NTA\n\nIf she won't take care of stuff she really should replace all of it because it is her fault.

It wasn't until she went to her parent's house to confirm the proper utensils to use while cooking that she was convinced, lol. This is what happens when people coddle their kids (not saying they did in all areas but they at least never taught her the basics of cooking). Offering to pay half is very reasonable since you didn't even have to do that.", "26\u2026? With trouble listening and learning from mistakes the first time around? Good luck man", "She needs to prove she knows how to treat non-stick pans before you replace anything. Tell her to buy one non-stick pan herself and demonstrate that she can use it without destroying the Teflon surface. Then (maybe) replace the rest. There's nothing wrong with cast iron, I have 3 skillets i use all the time. If she doesn't know anything about cooking she needs to listen to those who do.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAlso way for your girlfriend to completely disregard everything you've shown/explained to her. Only to turn around and have her Mom say the exact same thing.", "NTA and unless she had some sort of learning disorder, why does she need to be told more than once? She heard you explain how to use the pans. She saw the result of it the first time it stopped being non-stick from the damage she did. She heard you say not to do it again. She presumably has access to the internet where she could learn about it. So she does it again anyways. And still expects you to pay? She needs to replace what she wrecked in the first place.", "NTA\n\nIf she doesn't know, she needs to learn. But if she still destroys pans after learning how to cook with them, that's on her.\n\nThe moment I realised the danger of the non-stick teflon layer, I threw away all my non-stick pans. I now use really great non-stick pans and it's a bit more clean up, but I love them and I'm not looking back.", "NTA You showed her how to properly use the nonstick pans in the beginning and she destroyed them by insisting on doing things her way. If she wants to use nonstick again she should pay the entire cost herself as a stupid tax.", "NTA if she wants new pans she can get new pans. You have your pan that works for you. It's not your responsibility to replace the things she's destroying. She has the audacity to call you cheap", "NTA, if she wants you to pay for half of new pans, she need to pay half for the ones she destroyed first.", "NTA\n\n\nShe can go to Home Goods and buy herself a new non stick pan...( Great prices on quality stuff).  Give it several months to see how she does before tells buying a new set. The very least she can do is help pay half of it.", "NTA: I'm obviously missing the context but being precautious and using cast iron is very reasonable. Just let her huff for a while and keep telling her nicely to use the propper utencils", "NTA.\n\nThe girlfriend needs to learn how to treat your property with care and respect your things-- even if they will one day be her things. I wouldn't have bought the cast iron pans, but meh-- forgivable, considering that she refuses to buy more non-stick pans.\n\nAs for you... do you really want to be with this person? Does she really want to be with you? You both need to be partners. You need to care enough to teach her how not to destroy the pans (which you have), and she needs to care enough to learn what you and her mother have been trying to teach her, or at a minimum, dip into her own savings to replace each pan she destroys without grumbling.\n\nWhat concerns me most about your situation is that we shouldn't be at this spot, because caring for each other should have already resolved the issue. That this doesn't have an easy solution suggests that the relationship is already on an uneven footing. \n\nIs she a little out of your league? Does she think she's slumming? This is an important test about whether or not she can be a compatible mate for you... and she's flunking out, I'm sorry to say. Good luck, hope you guys can work it out with some empathy and consideration.", "NTA\n\nShe should be worried about the amount of Teflon she's consuming. That's exactly why its generally common knowledge that you don't use metal utensils on non-stick cookware. \n\nIt makes no sense that you should contribute any money towards new pans when she ruined the ones you already had. On top of that you didn't leave her without a pan in the meantime, you just provided pans she doesn't like. Hypothetically, if you got into wearing makeup and in the process destroyed her collection I doubt she would be okay with splitting the cost of new products half and half just because you didn't know what you were doing. \n\nNot sure how she got the house on the prairie vibe from cast iron cookware, it's pretty common place for people to use cast iron in my experience.", "NTA since she destroyed all your nonstick pans because she refuses to learn how to use them properly. If she wants to use nonstick pans, she can replace the ones she ruined. I wouldn't even pay for half of that, if I were you.", "NTA", "Cast iron is amazing, a little more effort but ultimately so much better to cook with. You told her not to do it and she did it anyways. \n\nNTA your gf sounds like a child.", "NTA.. replace the whole girlfriend..", "NTA. Teflon is terrible. Cast iron is definitely the way to go.", "NTA\n\nTime she puts some skin in the game. She could have believed you regarding silicone utensils, but she didn't.", "NTA. Cooking with cast iron is super simple and bonus it adds extra iron in your food (and does not create cancer causing Teflon flakes).\n\n**Life pro tip for making cast iron non-stick:** Heat your empty cast iron skillet to desired temp. Be patient! Only when it\u2019s hot, add the oil or butter. Wait for oil to get to temp. Be patient again! Then add food. Nothing will stick! \n\nIf you add oil before the pan\u2019s hot or add the food before the oil is hot it won\u2019t work. Patience is the most important piece.", "NTA for refusing to buy new non-stick pans. The way she treated them is appealing. However, I will say that for someone who doesn't know how to cook, cast iron will likely make her not want to anymore.\n\nSure, cast iron gives a great crust and can become almost fully nonstick if you season it enough (I have eight layers of seasoning on mine), but it's also a friggin pain in the ass to use and needs even more babying than nonstick. I ended up replacing all my nonstick pans with stainless steel instead, except for a single small nonstick skillet that I use for fish and eggs. I barely ever use my cast-iron since it's:\n\nA - Way too heavy to the point that moving it around hurts my wrists;\nB - You look at it funny and it can rust. Cleaning it is a pain. The bottom of mine was starting to rust despite being stored in a friggin closet away from the kitchen just because I live in a city/country that has very high air humidity.\nC - You're restricted on what kinds of foods you can cook since acidic foods damage the seasoning.\n\nJust get yourself a cheap set of stainless steel or something. Equally for life, but it's not so fussy to use.", "Nta. You clearly stated what would happen,  she didn't listen.  Continue to use your cast iron and let her sulk until she ponies up the money for the pans she ruined.", "NTA - paying half sounds like a reasonable deal, especially because I bet she will destroy them in a week or two. Also, when mom says she listens but not when you try to teach her?", "NTA  \n\n\nShe's an adult and can take responsibility for buying herself what she needs unless you're holding her hostage.", "Nta.
