Does she really want to be with you? You both need to be partners. You need to care enough to teach her how not to destroy the pans (which you have), and she needs to care enough to learn what you and her mother have been trying to teach her, or at a minimum, dip into her own savings to replace each pan she destroys without grumbling.\n\nWhat concerns me most about your situation is that we shouldn't be at this spot, because caring for each other should have already resolved the issue.

On top of that you didn't leave her without a pan in the meantime, you just provided pans she doesn't like.

However, I will say that for someone who doesn't know how to cook, cast iron will likely make her not want to anymore.\n\nSure, cast iron gives a great crust and can become almost fully nonstick if you season it enough (I have eight layers of seasoning on mine), but it's also a friggin pain in the ass to use and needs even more babying than nonstick.

I barely ever use my cast-iron since it's:\n\nA - Way too heavy to the point that moving it around hurts my wrists;\nB - You look at it funny and it can rust. Cleaning it is a pain.

Never occurred to me to use it on my pyrex, you GENIUS YOU! Thank you!", "r/castiron", "Sure, but like\u2026 why? I own cast iron to use, not to post about them online. Once you know how to season them you just\u2026 cook on them.\n\nI can only think of 3 posts that should be on that sub tbh.\n\n1. how to season (warm up pan, coat in light coat of high smoke point oil, heat in oven upside down at 375-400F for 90mins, let cool in oven, repeat twice)\n2. How to clean (soap is fine, avoid abrasive chemicals, don\u2019t do the salt scrub thing unless you HAVE to & are ok with re-seasoning, don\u2019t let sit wet or in water)\n3. A few tips around cooking with heavy iron or maybe recipes.\n\nEach to their own tho. If ppl enjoy it, their call.", "Soap shouldn't clean the seasoning off if you're seasoning correctly. Seasoning is heating oil to the point it plasticizes and creates a nonstick-ish coating on the cast iron. You have to actually cook the oil onto the pan. It will wear down, which is why you should re-season every now and then, but it won't wash off with the occasional dish soap and water.", "You did something else to strip the seasoning. Dish soap alone won't do it.", "My first thought was she thought he was man-splaining.", "On top of that acidic foods strip the seasonings quicker. I use my cast iron a lot but not for tomato based sauces . Something which is frequent in the Indian cooking I do", "Lol benefits of cast iron besides cooking: \n\n1. If an intruder came into my house, I\u2019m grabbing a cast iron skillet to use as a baseball bat lol", "It's like flushable wipes. If they go down when you flush, then they are factually flushable. It's just a horrible idea to do it.", "Unless she uses a hammer they may just need a refresh. Self cleaning oven cycle to cook clean, wash, and reseason. Honestly the cast iron fetishism gets old but these are just cheap hunks of iron. Scour and reseason if you mess it up. Rust can be removed.  They didn't become popular except because they were cheap and durable. Foodie nutters try to make it into something complicated but it is not.", "Scrambled takes more effort. I always have some residue. My fried eggs slide right off my cast iron and carbon steel. Both lodge brand, so not super expensive either.", "This! I am in love with these. I have multiples in different colors and from different manufacturers (don\u2019t care about matchy matchy) . I don\u2019t have any Le Crueset because I\u2019m old and cheap.", "Vintage cast iron is much lighter than most of what you can get new today. All of my favorite cast iron is at least 70 yrs old.", "Stainless is great for pan sauces and acids.", "In case the above link doesn't work for anyone:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B083P6RH5T/", "They're so great!", "Yes. Love it", "Always pretend I am a knight when I scrub.", "He should absolutely just keep the cast iron. Hell, buy a couple more; we have four in our kitchen. We traded out all the nonstick for cast iron, aluminum, and stainless steel cookware for bird safety (fumes from nonstick pans can kill them instantly). We cook in them daily using beautiful metal spatulas and it\u2019s no problem, we just use the stainless pans for things like tomato sauce.", "Soap is fine, recommended even, but make sure it\u2019s dry!", "We had a bread bag twist tie stick to the bottom of a plate and go in the microwave \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Luckily I saw the spark and stopped it at just melting the bottom of the plate slightly.", "There are microwaves that come with metal bowls as accessories. As long as they don\u2019t  have sharp edges is fine.", "My calphalon pans have a 10 year warranty, I just send them back after a few years when the coating wears off and then the warranty starts over again. I\u2019m on my 2nd replacement. \n\nHopefully they get recycled and not thrown away but idk what they do with them.", "Last time I changed my cars oil, I filled it up with cast iron pans instead of 10w40.  It took a lot of pans, but now I'm getting 88mpg and the exhaust smells like garlic butter, so I think I'm getting good return on the investment.", "https://youtu.be/yX4hXnyfozo\n\nReally good video from the Minute Earth people about them here. I personally only use carbon and stainless in my kitchen!", "We use mostly cast iron, but also have a carbon steel wok, comal, and giant skillet, all of which I love, too. Specific pans for specific uses.", "This is what I do too!  My off-limit pans are, ironically, my cast irons.  And I don't touch my boyfriend's teflon.  It works pretty well for us.", "If it were a man doing it it would 100% be called weaponized incompetence. She has been told multiple times. Not knowing the first time sure could be incompetence/negligence. Doing it multiple times...is doing it on purpose.", "She could easily destroy the cast iron, too. She wouldn\u2019t treat it properly. I know OP would find them stacked and rusty. NTA.", "Yeah.  I have had to explain to a *shocking* number of roommates that you can't use metal in teflon and you shouldn't leave wood soaking in the sink or put it through the dishwasher.  I legitimately don't know if it is willfull ignorance or actual lack of common sense but, if my roommate population has been a representative sample, then a far far higher percentage of people than I would ever have believed are either clueless or lazy when it comes to the use and care of cooking implements.", "All the non stick she\u2019s eaten has made her think her cooking is ok. She doesn\u2019t sound real but I have seen someone try to cook pancakes in a nonstick with no lube, they said it wasn\u2019t needed because nonstick. They released when carbonized.", "only if it's very acidic", "They're also just enormous and bulky and I've never had a kitchen that wasn't tiny lol. Ceramic pans are easier to stack in a tiny cupboard and much more low profile. Never had a problem cooking anything without the sacred cast iron. Got myself a carbon steel skillet for searing and it's been wonderful too!", "Sorry. Any pan sauce that actually tastes good will obliterate your seasoning.\n\n\nHappy?", "I think you meant \"appalling\"!", "Pro chefs usually being men is part of the irony and stupidity about gendering cooking, yes"]}
