I\u2019m not sure whether I should apologise.\n\nETA - for everyone asking how it got out that I told Harry. Jamie went home and went off on Natalie about him not getting the job, as it was basically a lock with Harry doing it as a favour to Nat. She figured the only person who would have changed Harry\u2019s mind about doing her the favour was me, so she called and I ended up telling her the truth. She then told everyone else.\n\nEdit 2: for everyone who missed it in the post, Harry and I are *ROOMMATES* so my home is his home. Harry has a home office and works out of that office most days. He conducts meetings from there all the time which is normally fine because I know all his employees really well.

Harry decided not to hire Jaime. Full stop. Sorry but friends get you the interview. The job is not yours to have. \n\nJaime and Natalie are entitled a*** in this situation. \n\nYou however framed it I such a way as you getting in the way of this opportunity.

I wonder if he even has a person in his life that would provide a good reference.", "NTA.    \n\n\nI'm sorry for Natalie, but think about it this way, I'm assuming that Harry is a friend as well as a roommate?  Even if he's only a roommate, don't you think that obligates you to him and his well-being in some ways as well?  \n\n\nMeaning, you have some obligation to explain when a person's demeanor would make them a bad fit for their company?  If he was hired, then did his normal thing, it's expensive for a company to hire and train someone, so they'd have wasted all that time and money, not to mention all the people Jamie would have offended during his employment.  Or, do you think he's magically an angel at work?  Somehow I doubt it, I wonder why he's been unemployed for so long?  Hmmm?", "NTA\n\nYour loyalty is to your roommate/friend and you were honest.

It\u2019s like Jamie is trying to tear her self-esteem down so he can be the one to build her back up and she relies solely on him for her feeling of self-worth.

If I were Harry I would be mad if OP didn\u2019t warn me about things like that before I hired him.", "This is why it is not a big deal. If Jamie is clearly an AH, he would not be employed at Harry's company for long anyway. I guess Jamie and Natalie are desperate.

He really did his best to prep him for the interview and give him insight about the position. From what I heard, the interview went well up until salary negotiations. My bf told our friend if he asked for a specific range, the job was his. My bf also made the mistake of telling him the budget. Our friend basically asked for 10k less than the budget. My bf was not happy, but that said, I don't think our friend wanted the position anyway.", "That still sounds like a really bad idea. I'd avoid having candidates in my apartment at all costs. Harry could be accused of anything and there won't be any witnesses. He also could run the risk of disgruntled candidates approaching him later", "Nobody knows who Jaimie is. All we hear is \"he does some below the belt jokes\".\n\nAnd rather than trying to hide it, she was probably itching to tell Harry about how she doesnt like Jaimie, otherwise she would have just left the house during the interview making up an excuse. And as a consequence, possibly, severely, negatively impact the life of her friend. \n\nNow that is a person i do not give the slightest credit when it comes to judging another person. And even less so, is that a friend anyone needs.  \n\n\nHow you interprete it is a matter of perspective.   \nOP is dumb though - has the awareness of a rock, otherwise she would have never let it come to that, unless she is an asshole and knew where this was going for the satisfaction of her own emotions.", "> So in that situation, how these friends perceive Jamie is highly important. Aside from Natalie, this friend group thinks very poorly of Jamie.\n\nYou don't know that.

Harry is still an AH for intentionally making Jamie do \"extras\" in the interview process  fully knowing that he had already decided not to hire him.

I normally never comment, but this is sounding really dangerous to me, tbh. This isn't that far from physical abuse it's actually a textbook sign of a psychopath or psychopathic tendencies. Your friend is a victim too she just doesn't realize that's what it is, or maybe she does, but she's scared of him n what he could do to her/fam/friends/pets. Usually, see this pattern in DV cases all of the time. The abuser has to see exactly how much the victim will take & escalate until it comes to some pretty devastating consequences. Watch out because he could also use this event as a tactic to separate your friend group first, then separate her entirely. Then he'll have her all to himself, which is an even more terrifying thought, tbh. Plz be safe.", "I'm surprised that no one has suggested that Jamie call Harry and find out why he was passed over.

My point was that the other people, even on my team, who do interviews have their own formats which differ in time and content than mine.\n\nSometimes I will get with other people who will all be interviewing candidates for the same position to make sure we all understand what the requirements for the position are. It is just that different people at my company have different techniques for figuring out who would work out.", "Look, did the logic make sense? Maybe not. But the fact is, when I thought of Jamie in my house I had a visceral reaction and a sour face and that prompted Harry to ask what was wrong and the can of worms was opened. I\u2019m not saying I made a compelling case as to why Jamie should never be in the apartment or anything like that. I\u2019m saying I involuntarily made a face. Could I have made more of an effort to make Harry drop the subject? Maybe. But I didn\u2019t pull out a little notebook of slights and describe them all either.

I do think Harry was an AH for making Jaime do all that prep work and made the interview even longer if your feedback had already swayed him not to hire Jaime.\n\nWhere you screwed up was in waiving the plausible deniability you had in your role in Jaime not getting the job. You should never have admitted to telling Harry negative things about Jaime. Contrary to what Jaime and Natalie think, being the boyfriend of the friend of the roomate of an employee (or even the owner) of a company Jaime applied to did not guarantee Jaime a \"lock\" on the position. Harry was doing a favor by considering Jaime, but at the end of the day, business is business, you don't hire someone for a job as a favor to someone else, you hire the best candidate for the job. You should have just said to Natalie \"I don't know, Natalie, it's Harry's company, I wasn't involved in the hiring process, I don't know who the other candidates were, or what feedback the other employees at Harry's company gave about Jaime's performance in the interview process or his overall qualifications.

It might not immediately convince Natalie to stop being mad at you, but you will be able to strongly assert the moral high ground here. Tell Natalie you had an obligation to alert your roommate and friend Harry of red flags that would have made Jaimie a bad fit for Harry's company, and a possible HR liability. If you hadn't, and it had caused a problem, it might have created a real strain between you and your roommate. Also tell her than instead of being mad at you, Jaime should be reflecting that this experience should demonstrate to him he never knows where opportunities to professionally network come from, and his behavior in situations he *assumes* have nothing to do with his professional life *can* affect it, can close doors to him.", "NTA\n\nHis off the clock antics are an HR issue.

It was wild of him to assume he was a lock for the job. In my experience, unless you're talking VERY close friends and/or VERY low level jobs where qualifications are minimal, the most you can expect from a friend of a friend is getting the interview. THAT'S the favor. You still have to earn the job. Does he seriously think Harry is going to put his own ass on the line by full on hiring someone he barely knows as a favor? Put aside his terrible personality, what if there were simply more qualified candidates?", "Why should OP stick her neck out and cover for a guy who can't even just refrain from insulting her to her face?  That's the bare minimum of social skills and manners, and they guy can't even be bothered to do that much.  \n\n\nI agree with you, OP didn't go out of her way to sabotage him, she just honestly but tactfully answered her friend and roommate's questions when her clearly perceptive roommate noticed her discomfort.

So this is an issue between Nat and Jamie then.  I hate to say it, but this is what can happen when a women decides to be a controlling mommy to her useless male partner.  She should have told Jamie that she heard Harry has an opening and suggest that Jamie contact Harry directly, like grownup men do.  Nat could have followed up with Harry later, with a \"by the way, how did it go with Jamie\" kind of thing.  But she choose to reach out to Harry and take control by arranging things herself.

So many automatically assumed the middle aged white dude was the CEO and fully focused on him and often being dismissive of the other two.

Does he even know that you guys dislike this if you\u2019re all doing the same to him? \n\n2. Why would seeing your friend mean you have to have her boyfriend around at the same time, and if she allows him to speak to all of you in a way you have expressed you dislike and which is \u201cdemeaning\u201d (which it sounds like you haven\u2019t), why do you all continue to value her friendship over self respect? \n\n3. Have you seen him call her these things, and what do you guys do when he does? He\u2019s obviously the asshole if he does, but I fail to see how ruining his chance of getting out of the house and away from her for a large part of the week helps anybody. If he\u2019s a \u201cPR disaster waiting to happen\u201d, then they\u2019ll realize that and let him go. It\u2019s not your job to vet that.\n\n4. Why did you need to say anything about him? All you needed to do was say you\u2019d rather be out of the house when the interview took place, or just\u2026be out of the house when it took place?? No need to elaborate and to hint at there being a reason you don\u2019t want him around. \n\n5. How do you know they purposely put him through the ringer knowing he wouldn\u2019t be hired regardless? Sounds like you said some really horrible things, not \u201cnothing too bad\u201d, and he decides then and there to mess with him and informed you of this fact. Sounds really shady actually.\n\n6.

I lean towards ESH. I frankly don't think OP is being honest about what she said to Harry that resulted in this guy not getting a job. If she really did just say \"oh he said a few mean things\" then why is most of the friend group so mad at her? Why did something like that cost him a job? Why is Natalie so mad? I think there was a lot more to that conversation.\n\nOf course, based on what OP is saying the guy sounds needlessly mean, and OP said that her goal wasn't revenge. Nepotism is also a shitty way to get a job.\n\nEven if OP is justified to a degree, this was probably a bad idea. So now the friend group is divided, her (former?) friend Natalie is extremely upset and basically is now collateral damage because this impacts her financially as well, and this guy is out of a job.

There was already conflict, now there is a broken friend group and a massive escalation in conflict.", "1. We don\u2019t make fun of him to his face. The worst we\u2019ve ever said to him jokingly is \u201cJamie if you keep crashing girls night, you should start wearing a skirt\u201d or some variant. When he\u2019s not around, yeah we make fun of the fact that he flirts with every woman at the table except his girlfriend, and that he won\u2019t shut up about his car, and we bet on how long it will take him to say something gross on a night out. Again, none of this is to his face but frankly if you behave like trash, people are going to laugh at you, especially people who have your company foisted upon them because you won\u2019t let you girlfriend out alone. \n\n2. We\u2019ve stayed friends with her because Jamie is awful, and she doesn\u2019t have any other friends or family around but us. If we cut her off, she\u2019s just left with him and that didn\u2019t seem like a good thing to do. This has all gone to crap now anyway but we felt like cutting her out would be leaving her to the wolf. \n\n3. Yes, we all hear him say this stuff. We stand up for ourselves when he talks shit to us, and he\u2019ll be all \u201cokay jeez it was a joke sorry you\u2019re so sensitive I won\u2019t do it again\u201d (and will do it again) but we can\u2019t stand up for her if she just continually brushes it off and tells us to drop it, so he talks to her how she lets him. No, it\u2019s not my job to vet him, and I didn\u2019t even say the full extent of the awful things he has said, I said the bare minimum to explain why I was uncomfortable. \n\n4. This is what happened. Harry said \u201coh Jamie is coming for his interview at 12\u201d and I guess I must have made some kind of sour face because he was like what\u2019s the face for and I said nothing and he said no it\u2019s not nothing why do you not want him here. I just said I just don\u2019t really want to be here want to be here when he\u2019s here, and Harry kept pushing. Eventually I told him I wasn\u2019t really that cool with Jamie because he called me a narcissistic b*tch and because he keeps insinuating I\u2019m a s*x worker. Again this is the *mildest* way of describing Jamie\u2019s behaviour. I didn\u2019t have to say anything but I\u2019m also not in the habit of lying to my friends.  After hearing what Jamie had been saying Harry was like yeah I\u2019m not going to pay a salary to someone who talks to you like that he can f*ck off. I said to him to just leave it and hire Jamie if he was good for the job. Harry then had the interview at his office and made it needlessly long just to be a petty dick, which he told me about afterwards. \n\n5. Kind of answered above but I know about the interview because Harry told me. I said to him he should have cancelled the interview rather than do that but he said he just wanted Jamie to feel like an idiot for a bit. Petty behaviour, I know, he knows. Mind you, Jamie knows NONE of this, he and Natalie don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t get the job, they just decided it was my fault. \n\n6. Harry did know Jamie was kind of a jerk, but he thought he was a run of the mill, a little bit too into himself jerk. Jamie is less of a jerk when the guys around than when he\u2019s out with just Natalie and our girl group. And we didn\u2019t mention the worst stuff he says because we wanted to keep Natalie in the group, and we knew the guys wouldn\u2019t want him around if they knew the misogynistic stuff he says.

It cost him the job because Harry said he doesn\u2019t want someone on his payroll who talks to me or treats me the way Jamie has. \n\nI hope that clears up your questions. \n\nPs. What i told Harry is about Jamie\u2019s continual insinuations that I am \u201cfor sale\u201d and that he called me a narcissistic b*tch for gifting Natalie a spa day (he was mad because he wasn\u2019t invited).

On top of that, she showed up sucking on the straw of the Big Gulp she'd purchased with her lunch.  Her fast food bag was in her other hand.  This is what she showed up toting along with her when she showed up 45 minutes late.\n\nEven though it wasn't up to me, I knew she was done once my two bosses found out.   I went to get them, and told them about her first impression.  They decided, nope.  One of them then went in and told her so, that she would not be considered.  Then he came back to me and said, \"Please escort her out.\"\n\nI went in and said, \"Let me show you to the elevators.\"  Well, apparently, my boss had read her the riot act so thoroughly that her whole demeanor changed and she figured she could beg her way back into being considered.\n\nShe ridiculously told me that \"no no\", she wasn't late.  She was on time, and our receptionist made her sit there for an extra 45 minutes before letting any of us know she was there.\n\nWhat she didn't know is that every 10 minutes or so, I checked in with reception, with her recruiter, with lobby security, etc. to see if she'd arrived.  I finally had to go to the ladies' room, and on my way back, I saw her checking in with our receptionist.  I went back to my desk to get a copy of her resume just as our receptionist called me to let me know she'd arrived.\n\nSo I said to her, \"No, that's not the truth either.  I saw you signing in when you DID arrive, and now you're trying to throw our receptionist under the bus?  Absolutely not.

That\u2019s a mistake you only need to make once as a manager before you figure out people can learn skills, it\u2019s harder to learn not to be an asshole.", "No offense, but Natalie sounds like she has terrible taste in men. If someone needs to have THAT many excuses for shitty behavior, he is probably just be a shitty person. \n\nYou are correct that it's not your choice who she dates, but you (and all your other female friends in the group that have issue with him!) do have a choice as to whether or not to put up with his shit. You've mentioned that you don't make the jokes/comments to his face -- maybe it's time to, maybe he won't find it so funny when he's at the other end of it. And you can definitely choose not to spend time with Jamie. Keep lines of communication open with Natalie, but straight up disinvite Jamie, and if he shows up for girls' nights, make it clear that he is unwelcome, and then leave.", "Well, she has bad taste with this one. \n\nWe just knew if we made those comments to his face he\u2019d eventually stop letting her come out with us. She only comes if he also comes and if he doesn\u2019t want to, she doesn\u2019t. \n\nBut it\u2019s all moot anyway. The fallout of all this has exposed Jamie\u2019s behaviour and now the wider group wants nothing to do with him and my one girlfriend doesn\u2019t either and Natalie isn\u2019t speaking to me so it\u2019s looking like she\u2019s going to get cut out of the group anyway.", "I wonder if he\u2019s much scarier in private and she is afraid to leave. It sounds like a complete mess.", "Harry owns the company.  Harry can hire whomever he likes.", "lol, I was about to comment the same.  A good executive assistant or PA is worth gold! Treat them accordingly. And be nice to the receptionist.  She's stuck up front while everybody else hides in their office or cubicle. ;-)", "Please do tell me how and when I said that op should tiptoe around Nathalie's abusive bf. Good luck, bc I said no such thing, so who's derailing?\n\nYou said Nathalie \"allows\" him to demean her friends, ie, you said his demeanor is at least in part Nathalie's responsibility. I said that Nathalie should not be blamed for \"allowing\" her bf to be demeaning towards her friends, because his abuse is HIS responsibility and his alone.", "don\u2019t mix personal with professional? yet the only reason jamie would\u2019ve gotten this job is because of his personal connections through natalie? he doesn\u2019t get to pick and choose when he wants to use connections, his personal behaviour matters more if anything because natalie is the one orchestrating this and harry made a decision based on all the facts at hand including his interview. if he was a stellar applicant, things likely would\u2019ve been different but he was average and with an awful personality, he won\u2019t get far.", "I will say though asking him to do work and a presentation outside of the normal requirements is pretty rude though. Finding a job is hard enough, if he wanted to give him a longer interview sure but wasting an unemployed person's time with false pretences is messed up too. \n\nOp NTA. \n\nJamie 100% should lose a job for his behavior off the clock if it's a friends referral. If youre bad enough behaved that someone feels it's worth telling a coworker or person hiring you that is 100% on the misbehaving person. Being unemployed sucks but being an asshole has consequences.", "That\u2019s usually the way that goes. Lots of people hide behind jokes - they really mean what they said but when confronted, they lie and say it was just a joke and you\u2019re too sensitive. These same people also expect others to treat them with kid gloves and never tease them, never say anything that might upset them, etc. Because, ultimately, their feelings are ultra important and literally nothing else is at all.\n\nNTA, OP. Harry and his company dodged a bullet on this one.", "Why on earth would Harry waste his own personal time by interviewing Jamie for 3 hours just to be petty?    That's definitely not what happened.\n\nI agree with other commenters that the reason for the extended interview was  to fully test Jamie.   It would have been easy for him to scam a quick 5 minute interview but in 3 hours he revealed enough of his personality for Harry to believe your side.", "According to Harry, because he wanted Jamie to feel like an idiot, which I guess he did since he went home and got mad. But idk, I\u2019m not super concerned about that.", "Maybe harry does do exactly what you tell him lol.  Sounds like he was going to do a \u201cnepotism\u201d hire without due diligence, so it\u2019s a good thing you spoke up", "Whenever I feel like that might be true, I\u2019ll ask him to stop letting the cats on the balcony or to not run the dishwasher half full and I am quickly disabused of the notion that he does anything I tell him \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut yeah, in the long run I may have saved him a problem. There\u2019s plenty of other people he can hire, he\u2019s not worried.", "Tell him he\u2019d be handsomer if he smiled more.", "Absolutely brutal. 5 star comment", "Perfect reply. No notes.", "I was coming her to say this lol", "I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say I laughed at this harder than I\u2019ve laughed in a little while, and probably more than I should have. Thank you for that.", "I do agree that Natalie is in a toxic relationship and she is a victim, but she is not at all right. She stopped talking to OP and decided do tell everyone this story and I just know she is probably bad mouthing OP, defending her boyfriend. And this is very much not okay and it isn't OP's responsability to stay trough this toxic dynamic until her friend wakes up and leave. \n\nAt this point, Natalie could be in a toxic relationship because she may be just as toxic, we have no way to know", "Touche my friend.", "I maniacal laughed at this", "I don\u2019t know why I found this so funny", "Teacher pre-service days are the worst", "\ud83d\ude02", "No, we need someone of exceptional fatness for this role! Borderline fat just won't cut it", "Big Glados vibes from these comments lol", "An you're too fucking..... blonde!", "He sounds like the type who won't take on work he deems \"beneath\" him, so he's probably holding out for those upper level jobs that are way more competitive too", "OP posted an update that Harry interviewed him at his registered company office.", "A neutral location would have been more professional. Unless it's some type of tech startup or work from home situation.", "https://preview.redd.it/jljedq95mgoz.png?auto=webp&s=378be2ac16434360b65cad09b88cb552fc9706e0", "This comment reminds me of a temp who started at the company I worked at years ago and my colleague was training him on a process that I'd designed/implemented and he said to her \"Look, just tell me how she's been doing it and I'll make it better\". I still piss myself laughing when I think about it."]}
