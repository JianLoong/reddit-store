When she called me she said outright \u201cI know you told Harry not to hire Jamie\u201d and I told her that wasn\u2019t true, so she was like, I know you said something, so I admitted what had happened. After getting off the phone with me Natalie told everyone else. They called reached out to get my side, I\u2019m not being ostracised or anything, it\u2019s just that natalie is now not speaking to me and refusing to go where I go, but the rest of the group are still talking to both of us.", "> I told Harry not to do anything about this, and that he should hire the best person for the job. \n\nI understood it as \"just interview him normally\", hence why I thought you were getting flak.\n\nBut if you aren't bothered by how Harry handled it, then fair. You said it yourself, Jamie is a walking HR red flag - Harry shouldn't have to deal with the responsibility of hiring someone like that.\n\nEither way, you're definitely NTA.", "Yeah, him blaming Natalie still makes no sense.  Did he think she set it all up and then she badmouthed him?  Or that the whole thing was a prank?  Why would he suspect someone who cares about him of doing either of those things?", "Sooo he doesn\u2019t want her to have a spa day without him?  You\u2019re accumulating enough red flags to make a quilt, here.\n\nYou haven\u2019t mentioned your gender, so I don\u2019t know if Jamie\u2019s insults are misogynist or homophobic (even if you\u2019re a straight male, the insults would still have those connotations) or both, but he\u2019s definitely something that ends with -ist and, yeah, complaints to HR.", "Totally justified. Also necessary. Fuck Jamie.", "W harry", "I don\u2019t know if he thinks that deeply about it. he just doesn\u2019t want it to be his fault, so he lashes out at her. I\u2019ve seen him get mad at her because his credit card didn\u2019t work while paying for drinks. He\u2019s just like that.", "Or racial. The \u201cfor sale\u201d really only has 2 meanings in this context that I can see. Jamie was either insinuating that OP sells their body sexually or that they\u2019re property. Neither are even remotely acceptable.", "I\u2019m a woman.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Ain\u2019t he just"]}
