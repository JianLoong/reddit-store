I was polite but I am made it known -subtly- that I was someone who liked to keep to himself.\n\n10 days later the house across and next to me finally showed signs of life, they were away for vacation or something. Both of them had 2 cars and kids. The garages only can take one car, and their kids seemed to like to play in the driveway. So they just started parking in mine, without as much as a word to me.\n\nLike I said I hate confrontation, and I read too many driveway/parking stories on many subs to be optimistic, so I just had a fence built around my front yard with a gate to the driveway. It is perfectly legal, just not up to HOA requirements, which don\u2019t apply to me.\n\nI had some complaints that I just ignored, both neighbors were pissed off I didn\u2019t just talk with them. \n\nIt was quiet for a few weeks, then I guess they wanted to be petty, so they parked on the street blocking my gate. I called a towing company straight away without giving them a warning.\n\nNow I am the neighborhood pariah (which I love actually), but I feel like I was the AH for doing so just after Christmas.

I\u2019m wondering what happened to all the grown ups on earth.", "NTA - they\u2019re the AH and entitled at that. Don\u2019t worry about them and look into installing cameras to make sure they don\u2019t damage your property.", "Imagine a neighborhood made for hermits like us. Nobody acknowledges anyone else's existence. Fences taller than the first floor windows. Nobody knows your name.", "I hate the dropping in kind of neighbors. Are you family? Are you a friend? Is my house on fire? Did I request your attendance? \n\nAlso kind of hate most of the neighbors though, they all constantly \"adopt\" cats and then just let them out when they're not kittens anymore. They don't feed or water, they don't de-sex them, they don't immunize them. Nothing.\n\nI only talk to a couple because we try and TNR everyone else's mistakes.", "My kind of neighborhood also.  The only time I've seen my neighbors is the last 12 years was when one had run their lawnmower into a ditch and we helped them tow it out.  They said thanks, we said your welcome.  Drama free zone!", "That is Ron Swanson level friendship.", "\u201cI once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.\u201d", "The sad thing is I\u2019d never know if I had another neighbor like me because I would never end up talking to them!", "I live on 22 acres in the middle of nowhere with no neighbors for MILES. Heaven. \n\nNTA OP. Who assumes it's okay to park in your drive way? Entitled dicks.", "But they sound like nice reasonable people. There are some people who might take advantage of your kindness and turn it into a nightmare. I\u2019d have loved to have neighbors like yours when I lived in a suburb.", "lol yeah got to love people being petty while illegally blocking a driveway and watch them go surprise Pikachu at the audacity of calling the cops on them for breaking a law", "Apparently, I guess. Entitled adult children.", "This makes sense -- it is *wild* to me that municipal taxes wouldn't cover certain streets (or parks if they're on public land) though! Is this generally for gated communities?", "Do your municipal taxes not cover that already? \n\nGenuinely asking, no snark. Your neighborhood sounds pretty!", "Your uncle must be proud of you. NTA, amazing job.", "Pffft, if they knew you were his nephew, they should\u2019ve known better! An allergy to bullshit clearly runs in the family lol", "There are two types of HOA--voluntary and involuntary. Some neighborhoods were built with voluntary HOAs because they only had a pool or some other amenity, and people could choose to join to use the pool or not. It is also voluntary if an HOA is created AFTER a neighborhood has already been built and homeowners decide to form one at a later date. \n\nMost HOAs these days are involuntary. They are created when a subdivision is built.", "It surprised me too. I\u2019m European and after reading about HOA\u2019s and the crazy controlling people on a power trip that come with it I wonder who in their sane mind would chose to join one. Unless you\u2019re the mother of user abanabee and you only become president to disband the HOA.", "In a condo situation, they're necessary. I've dealt with a few condo hoa's and they've been \"fine\". Any time you share walls or expenses with other owners, you actually want an hoa that can enforce payment for upkeep of these structures because when someone decides not to pay and there's no enforcement, everyone else is screwed. The one condo for my mom, they paid for roof, outside walls obviously, landscape, the pool, trash, etc. Never had a problem with them and they were super helpful when I remodeled. It was run by a professional company, as well, and had plenty in the reserve account to cover emergencies. All went as it should. \n\nBut an HOA in a neighborhood with standalone houses, run by the neighborhood posse as you said, that's a recipe for disaster, and I wouldn't touch that with a 10 foot pole. The board of these types of HOAs always attracts the most busybody useless people. \n\nOP and his uncle are legends, lol.", "I love that he \u201csettled\u201d down by traveling the world with a new loved one. That\u2019s precious \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\ude0a", "You are making your uncle proud!", "your uncle sounds like my kinda guy.", "I\u2019m a female and in love with your uncle!!! What a legend", "That\u2019s wonderful!!!!", "He would be the one neighbor I would WANT to talk to and be friends with! Then we could brainstorm on ways to annoy all the others! \ud83d\ude02", "Is your uncle interested in adopting a niece? Sounds like my kind of role model! Fuck the neighbors, and do your thing.", "I love the term hoot and a half, first time seeing it on reddit. Cheers to you & him.", "I vote we make a sub entirely dedicated to uncles stories! I so want to hear one.", "Him*", "But you know what? If someone really needs us, we would be there, because they would be good people who respected our boundaries", "Do you know how beautiful an 8ft wooden fence is? Because I do, and I wish I could share it with all of the fellow house hermits.\n\nEdit because I'm dumb af and sometimes words are just hard", "I would join that neighborhood in a flash!", "I'm in on this! I want to be a hermit that has selective game groups... though meeting people to play could be difficult...", "Come to Los Angeles this is all neighborhoods lol", "I recently had someone put me on the spot to be invited to a small get together. Out of social obligation I had to say  yes. They were fine, the evening was fun, but the next event her partner straight up made an ass of himself by getting way too high/drunk.   \n\n\nI simply do not have the energy to deal with it.", "Random dropping in is why I have a video doorbell. You can randomly drop by, and we can have our conversation without you coming inside! Mwahahaha!!", ">Are you family? Are you a friend? Is my house on fire? Did I request your attendance?\n\nThis! I don't like answering if even family or friends are there unless they're expected and I've had warning. The few times people have come to my door to sell shit I'm like \"hide, don't answer, maybe they'll leave\".\n\nI've had the Anderson windows people, the solar guy (he came by 4 times! 2 while I wasn't even there but my partner was and he'd told the guy no already), lots of local churches (there's like 15 in my tiny ass town of less than 10k people)... \n\nThe only time I'm like \"who is this and what do they want\" was a big dude who rang then stepped off my porch really respectfully. He wanted the trash couch and rug in my driveway from the previous owners. Cleetus and Bubba (not kidding) hoisted the couch like it was nothing on top of their minivan and took it to their mancave.", "My mom has a friend in her friend group that she doesn't not like, but she isn't her favorite. A few months before my mom retired from her demanding job as a mail carrier in the Midwest, this friend bought the house across the street and just randomly stops over to chat and pass time. My retired stepdad hates it the most. Now that my mom is retired they've installed a new fence and security cameras so they can actively avoid the couple across the street.", "*Give me all the bacon and eggs you have*", "Oh dude. My cul de sac is the BEST. T takes my garbage cans out, T2 brings them in. M, who normally isn't social at all, has started snow blowing my driveway out of nowhere. The family across the street will play with my dog (and maybe help me when I turned off my water and didn't know how to turn it back on.. First house in the burbs okay haha), down the street they said my dog can use their yards any time (I pick up), and I even shovel a spot for her on their park strip bc NY dog is too good for her own yard lol.\n\nAll my \"missing\" packages are someone worried they'll get porch pirated haha. \n\nWe had an earthquake and everyone was outside checking on everyone... There aren't words for how wonderful the neighbors are.\n\nMost are older so I do lots of tech support but I don't mind, it is kind of fun. I've also done emergency babysitting and try to help where I can. I love that I want to do acts of service every day. I'm tearing up a little thinking of how great everyone is.", "Not always.  The one time we had to deal with an HOA it was just a development that was kind of out in the middle of nowhere where we were renting.   It had 2 little parks that were the responsibility of the HOA.  We technically part of a small town that didn't really have any parks otherwise and I'm guessing they wouldn't have paid for them.", "No, there are four private companies that serve the town. Some of the neighboring communities have municipal service, ours chose not to.\n\nIt is pretty! Helps my property value as well. \n\nAnd here's the kicker: I'm retired and the HOA pays me $6000/year to do their bookkeeping and maintain their website. Takes me about 4 hours per month. That's our 'play' money. lol", "Is this an American thing?", "I can imagine some good use cases for an HOA! It\u2019s unfortunate they\u2019re often used for max pettiness and exclusion/bullying, rather than being limited to handling real problems.", "It\u2019s what my grandma used to call him, it kind of stuck", "Yeah, I'll save you from a house fire but make smalltalk? Fuck right off.", "Sounds good to me. You need help? I've got you. You need to talk about about the weather in Egypt. No thank you.", "I enjoyed California. It seemed to my 10 year old eyes that  every house had 6' cinderblock walls around their yards.  Great walls make great neighbors.", "Should have declined. \"Why\" would have been absolutely none of their business even if it were a lie.", "Oh I do too! It's how I know to ignore whoever it is lol\n\nEdit: unless it's a solicitor who ignores my very obviously placed \"please no solicitors\" sign on my door. Then I'm a super friendly satanist who wants to share my dark magic with my fellow man. Or I just make it awkward for them. Depends on how I feel.", "I need one of these. I have a literal 70+ yo neighbor who invites himself over constantly. I always say no but it deters him 0%. Wtf. I\u2019m honestly so sorry I ever smiled or waved. When his old ass finally dies I\u2019ll never make that mistake again \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I have one, so I can see who is there and then proceed to ignore them !", "I had some kid come around trying to get me to buy solar panels. He ignores my sign. Idk why but I entertain him and answer, politely saying hi but that we don't accept solicitors. \"Oh don't worry, im not selling anything!\" Mm. Sure. \n\n\"So you probably notice the neighbors down that have solar panels?\" Yes. \"We'll, we're going around to let you know about a 30% credit that homeowners with solar can receive.\" Thanks, but I don't have solar panels so how would this credit apply to me. (Awkward look at me because he already said he wasn't selling anything), I am politely but dead face looking at him, waiting. \"Uh...\" (awkward shuffling). Sorry, but we're not interested, have a nice day though.", "not some, but all.", "Yes. Read up on it. I'm not American and it blows my mind something like that exists.", "They have those in New Mexico, too. Loved the privacy when I lived there.", "[Succumb to my devil vagina magic!](https://kvta4.com/fondness/woman-chases-jehovahs-witnesses-off-of-her-porch-and-down-the-street-yelling-succumb-to-my-devil-vagina-magic/)", "Winner!!", "My sister has a \"No solicitations unless you're selling Girl Scout cookies\" sign. I get people don't like the cookies (okay, I don't get it, but I support your right not to!), but the Scouts are thrilled. Everyone else knows they really, really mean it. \n\nWin-win. Except for the non-scout people.  I support your curmudgeonliness. Curmudgeonitude? Anyhoo...", "Ya super weird. Just did a little research and apparently it also exists in Canada but until this moment I\u2019ve never heard of it.", "What a boss lmao"]}
