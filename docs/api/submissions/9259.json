When I was 16 weeks pregnant he went away for work and was gone for three months. We'd text and call whenever he was able to but a few weeks into him being away he stopped answering my texts and would keep calls super short. I thought something bad happened in his work situation and chalked it up to that. When he got back he was completely off and we started bickering a lot about small things. At this point I was 7 months pregnant, experiencing pregnancy complications, and becoming really dependant on him. Just over a month before my due date he told me he couldn't do this anymore and left, went no-contact with me. I had the baby by myself, my mum and sister helped me out a lot and still do but I've been my son's primary caregiver this entire time.\n\nA few months ago he got in contact with me to talk and explain himself.

After that he showed up at my mum's house, my mum is extremely nice so she heard him out. She said he just wanted to meet the baby and talk things out with me. I felt guilty being the reason they couldn't meet so I said ok and he's been spending time with him semi-regularly since. Last week he told me he's going away for work for a few months again and wants to have the baby stay with him over the weekend before he goes.

I know it's wrong to let bad feelings between parents seep into kid's lives, and as much as I have my valid reasons for not letting him stay over I'm worried that I'm being too untrusting and deep down I'm letting our issues make decisions regarding my son's relationship with his dad.

That is insane. I have two daughters and can\u2019t fathom leaving them out of my life entirely. You deserve to know every little tiny detail about his home environment before you send your kid there.

Good luck OP", "NTA  If it were me I would try to come up with a step up plan. Like after he gets back he can start with having a couple of supervised visits because your son is young enough that with his dad gone a couple of months he may not remember him, then he can have your son unsupervised for 4 hours at a time maybe a couple of times a week, then move up to 8 hours, then single over nights, then weekends. You can spend like a month on each step to build your son up to bring comfortable with his dad.  Before sending your son with his dad unsupervised I would make sure to get a legal custody arrangement (step up plans can usually be written into custody agreements).", "NTA You dropped the ball not filing for full custody or abandonment.  Get your custody  paperwork in order, supervised visitation if at all and don't let him have anymore time than you have to.  This man has proven to you that you can't trust him.  At this point he could take off with your child at any point and you would have to go to court to get him back.  Any chance he would take the child out of the country?

Going from not at all to multiple overnights is a leap.  Plus,18 months is old enough to get into trouble in a home setting that has not been baby-proofed.  \n\nSeems like it would be a better idea to arrange for him to spend as much time as possible with your son in a safe, controlled environment, and you can deal with arrangements for overnights after he returns.", "NTA. He's coming and going when it's convenient for HIM. Parenting is a full-time responsibility. It's unfair TO YOUR CHILD to bond to their father, only for their father to take off again for months at a time. Your ex wanted this baby and then abandoned you. Now he wants to gaslight you because he feels entitled to walk in and out whenever he wants? Hell no. One of you has to put your child's welfare first and it obviously won't be your ex.", "NTA. You are more forgiving than I\u2019d be at this point with your dead beat asshole of an ex.", "NTA - given what happened last time he went away for work, I can't help but think that you shouldn't trust him. Your baby is past the infant stage, probably sleeps through the night, and is a lot easier to care for... if he takes the baby away, he won't be as stressed as you were.\n\nI'd tell him that after what he did, you don't trust him. He can pick up developing a relationship with his kid when he gets back. And then make sure to establish full custody ASAP before he fights for shared.", "NTA.

Then you can discuss overnights. It sounds like you\u2019ve been doing everything without child support. If he wants the overnights so badly tell him to take you to court. He can become responsible for the kid then.\n\nETA it also says you\u2019ve been spending \u201csome\u201d time together\u2026 enough that your child isn\u2019t going to have a complete panic attack and meltdown mom isn\u2019t around?

You thought you knew him when you decided to have the baby, then he ghosted you for almost two years, and now waltzes in like he has a right to your son? He either needs to show off your son to his family or to the infertile girlfriend he left you for. NTA and see an attorney asap before you continue to let him see your son.

I didn't even know how to contact him...I think you're a little confused.", "I\u2019m not a lawyer nor do I have any children, but pretty sure even if she makes more money than him if she has primary custody he still needs to pay child support because the money is for the kid not her. \n\nYou\u2019re also being dense. She\u2019s not keeping the kid from the dad. She just doesn\u2019t want the kids first overnight to be with someone neither of them are comfortable with. It\u2019s also not her fault that he broke her trust and ghosted her for months before and after the baby was born. Nor is it her fault that he\u2019s leaving the country again and won\u2019t be around to do visits. He could probably FaceTime or Skype or something, but again that doesn\u2019t mean you get unrestricted access to an infant.", "You\u2019re all about \u201cfather\u2019s rights\u201d - what about the kid? They can have a relationship, but what\u2019s the rush? It will be infinitely better for the child if he eases into his life. Dad f*cked off for a year, now he has to prove he van be a reliable and steady presence in his son\u2019s life.", "But can the 18 month old who has never spent the night away from mom and can\u2019t verbally communicate with actual words handle it? Or what about dad? How is he going to handle a baby in meltdown mode because mom isn\u2019t around and things are different from the normal routine? \n\nIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s saying baby can\u2019t see dad. Just not spend the night yet.", "You really do not get it,  do you?  \n\nHe ABANDONED her while she was pregnant and ABANDONED the child at birth.he didn't even show up for the birth. They were not married so he HAS NO LEGAL RIGHT to time with the child. She has full custody and doesn't have to let him see the kid at all if she doesn't want to do so. \n\nHe should file for time through the court. Of course he'd have to not leave for months at a time because a child needs stability and a young child needs consistent visits. The court will set up child support with back pay from the date of birth.  \n\nWhat you need to remember is she is the parent that stayed,  had 100% responsibility all these months,  and he has not contributed one dime towards his child's needs.or a diaper or a damn meal. \n\nAnd here you are acting like this deadbeat is father of the year.   He isn't.  And the court won't see him in a positive light either and for good reason. A reason of his own making.", "She was there from the moment he was born. The dad could have been but chose not too. Instead of building a relationship with him from newborn, now he has to earn the trust of a toddler. That\u2019s on him.", "The dude *insisted* that they keep the pregnancy, when she would have chosen otherwise -- and then he bailed before the baby was even born, hasn't been around for 1.5 years, and hasn't paid child support.\n\nThere's no \"discrimination against fathers\" going on here -- there's just a deadbeat dad who's asking to keep the baby for a weekend when he has never cared for the baby for even an afternoon and he probably has absolutely no idea how to care for a baby. So no, he \"hasn't proved himself as a dad\", and OP would be crazy to let him take the baby for the weekend.", " Cry me a river after you look at actual statistics and studies about custody and how courts favor fathers when fathers actually decide they want to be involved. You're getting worked up about a myth.

He abandoned her while she was pregnant and then didn\u2019t show up to find out if he was even a father until the baby was more than a year old. He is not entitled to unsupervised overnights with a baby that is a stranger to him. And just so we are clear, he is a stranger entirely of his own making.", "Hell, yes, women can control their own bodies, including their uterus.  Get over it.  And abortion has NOTHING whatsoever to do with abandonment of a living, breathing child.  If anything, it prevents a heck of a lot of future child abandonment.  But it's funny you talk about misandry when what's quite apparent here are your anger and misogyny.\n\n  \nAnd no, when you abandon a kid for a year, you don't just get to come back and pretend everything is peachy keen now with no questions asked.  And it has ZERO to do with sex of the parent.  If mom had left the baby with dad or another family member and waltzed back in, she would be in the same position.   Children need stability and a minimum standard of care, and a parent who has shown an inability or unwillingness to provide either WILL face more stringent requirements when  they suddenly decide they are ready to play that role.   That doesn't mean they won't have any rights, but they do in fact generally end up having to demonstrate that they are fit for that role.  As they should, regardless of sex.", "Abortions have no impact on this conversation. Especially when women don\u2019t have a right to their reproductive autonomy in so many ways. I\u2019ve been asking for a hysterectomy (leaving my ovaries) since I was 18. I\u2019m 28. I\u2019ve asked at least 8 doctors, had two different therapists I\u2019ve worked with for more than 3 years each write letters on my behalf, had my mother come tell every one of those doctors that was the best choice for me, have spousal support (because ya know I might meet a man and change my mind), the fact that I\u2019ve literally broken my back and have a number of \u201clife altering\u201d medical conditions that could be genetically passed on and would make it painful and difficult for me to have then care for a child, plus I\u2019ve even offered to pay out of pocket after getting my inheritance from my grandparents deaths. \n\nIf *EITHER* parent disappears they have to earn back that trust. Luckily for this kid it happened before they\u2019re aware, but it doesn\u2019t mean the OP just forgives and forgets. Moves forward sure and eventually forgives, yes. But as the other person said you don\u2019t just get to waltz in and out of parenting. Unless this man is planning on staying in constant communication while out of the country the in and out seems like it\u2019s going to be his MO and not good for the kid.", "Stop bringing up abortion.

I wasn't trying to be difficult or petty, but I said no because I just wasn't in the right mind space to see him because I think I honestly kind of processed everything by reacting like he'd died and hadn't been thinking of him as a person who was still existing somewhere. After that he showed up at my mum's house, \n\nHE tried to make contact to get involved and you said \"NO\". YOU SAID NO!! so again, if it were up to YOU, then you would have just kept ignoring his desire to get involved. it was only because he went to your mother after you KEPT IGNORING HIM that you finally gave in", ">actual statistics and studies about custody and how courts favor fathers when fathers actually decide they want to be involved.
