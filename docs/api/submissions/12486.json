My wife is not a morning person so I usually wake up and get the kids ready for school, breakfast, lunches made, dressed, and one to the bus and the other I drop off at school. I have been working 6 days a week for the last 2 months so I took today off just to rest. My wife assured me she would take care of morning stuff with kids. She did not so I woke up normally and did everything. She woke up as I was walking out the door upset that I didn't wake her up.( I tried but she just said 5 more min then got up 1 hour later). I came home and she was working already and asked me what I wanted for lunch. I said I had to go food shopping and run some errands. I wouldn't be back. Again she was annoyed but I just shrugged and did what was needed for the house. I got back 3 hours later with groceries and stuff to make my own bday cake. She got upset and asked why do I ruin everything? I asked her if she had planned on getting or making me a cake? She stayed quiet. I told her don't be mad at me be mad at yourself you didn't do anything. I didn't make the cake because it would have been a problem. I said we can go out to dinner. Fast forward it's now 645 and she just put the cake in the oven and I said ok well it's too late to go out to dinner the kids need to eat. So I made dinner. Nothing fancy raviolis and sausage w/ garlic bread. So I finished and cleaned up she sarcastically asked how was my day while eating and I said I should have just gone to work. I would have had an easier day than expecting something/anything from you.

NTA at all, you did not ruin your birthday, you did your best to have a good day with your family, and it going south is 100% not your fault", "NTA, you did everything. She didn't even lift a finger. It's things like this that end marriages.", "NTA, if she wanted to she would, she only did to prove a point of \u201cbaking\u201d a cake and was half assed about it", "NTA. She doesn't get to get upset at you \"not waking her up\" when you tried and she just went back to sleep. She said that she would do everything today and you ended up doing everything on your birthday while she did nothing. She didn't even say happy birthday either? sheesh", "NTA\n\nBirthdays, for me at least, are the one day that should be easy. When you\u2019re with your long term partner they should be able to provide you with a low cost/stress free birthday. Nothing elaborate needs to happen but just something to show you that they care. Your wife didn\u2019t bother trying by the sounds of it. \n\nI do think maybe the communication should have been handled better by both of you. You guys know the date. Have a plan in place. Again, nothing expensive or fancy if that\u2019s not in the cards. You could have told her what you wanted so that dinner/cake wasn\u2019t left until last minute. Whether that was making plans for the meal before the day of or getting a babysitter for the kids. \n\nOh and happy birthday!", "NTA I feel like if you have to tell her to do the things, and if you don't they just aren't done, then she's not really taking care of things. You're just giving her chores.\n\nYou sound stressed and maybe you weren't the nicest in how you handled things, but also, it's your birthday! You get to be a little snippy if anything.", "Man I'm sorry!  If my husband ever tested me like this on my birthday, I would be so incredibly hurt, and vice versa. Is she ok?  Like is this normal or is she going through a depression?  If this is normal behavior, I'm just sorry.", "NTA - she owes you a do-over birthday if she wants to make amends.", "Haha NTA and this is why my wife and I don't do gifts cakes or anything for eachothers birthdays and its always birthday dinner at a place we both like so everyone wins and we like ot that way and the kids too. Kids are a different matter for their birthdays (and them doing something special for us).", "Info: I think if she just let me make my own cake and we went out to dinner at a normal time everything would have been fine. Who knows but I think I was just being petty", "HAPPY BIRTHDAY !\n\nNTA, sorry it didn't go as it should have.", "HAPPY BIRTHDAY OP. Know you're precious and deserve at least some form of acknowledgment on your special day! I don't know what's going on with your wife or if she's always been like that but I can't imagine someone despising their own spouse this much and being this petty and obnoxious! Of course NTA", "!updateme", "OMG so NTA and you didn't ruin your birthday, your wife did.  She's supposedly an adult she could have set an alarm and woke herself up!", "Happy birthday!!! NTA. She literally put zero effort into everything and is trying to make it sound like it's your fault. It is what it is\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She couldn't have even set herself an alarm? Somehow you're getting blamed for her not doing the bare minimum, maybe a part of her feels guilt but it sure isn't reflected in her actions. NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Listen, my husband and our two kids are morning people. I'm not. So I would start our own private celebration the eve of his bd. Days before, I'd have hyped up our kids about the special day and two gifts from them to their dad. So, they would come into our bedroom with the gifts already. There was no chance of me going back to sleep, lol.", "Happy Birthday OP \n\nNTA. And please reflect on whether this is how you want/deserve to be celebrated by your partner in the future.", "NTA. You gave what you got. She completely ignored you and gave you attitude for trying to celebrate yourself. Talk to her but her attitude is shit.", "NTA OP! Happy birthday from an Internet Stranger! I am so sorry you were not treated special on your birthday.  Does your wife even like you? This is just so sad and heartbreaking. You appear to be a responsible husband and parent, you deserved so much better!", "Happy birthday op!!!!!", "Nta, happy birthday", "NTA I'm so sorry and I hope you can find someone who is a partner someday", "Happy Belated Birthday. I'm sorry you're going through that with someone that seems to take you for granted. You deserve better and you need to tell her that.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nOP you deserve better than this!! You really really do. You didn\u2019t ruin your birthday, she did. She is being willfully malicious and intentionally hurting you. You did what was necessary to make sure that everyone was fed and to the places they needed to be, she intentionally sabotoaged every attempt you made at having even the smallest nice thing for yourself: a restful morning? Intentionally sabotaged. Lunch together? Sabotaged. Birthday cake? Sabotaged. A meal you didn\u2019t have to cook and then clean up after? Sabotaged. And then she has the gall to blame it on you because you dared to want a birthday where you didn\u2019t have to do everything yourself. It\u2019s emotionally abusive \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to hurt you if you wouldn\u2019t want better for yourself\u201d.", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry you deserved a better birthday and an apology from her.

I can\u2019t imagine ever making my husband feel this way on his birthday.", "This is why I'm glad I'm single. My friends treat me better than your wife. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing to not do anything for your birthday. It\u2019s another to continuously go back on promises all day and then blame you when you do anything for yourself. It seems like the only acceptable option for her would be for you to be quietly miserable and ignore the birthday completely. \n\nShe must be lashing out because she feels guilty from not waking up on time and then watching you take care of yourself, but she made it way way worse by lashing out and not showing any sense of accountability", "Sounds like you are stressed and should take it easy and chill out a bit man, from your story it seems your wife barely said anything and you just barked at her. Maybe you guys are both stressed? Try to take a vacay and relax a bit, get a babysitter for a weekend or something.", "ESH\n\nI really do get your frustration, but you're being super passive aggressive and that's not helpful...\n\nJust communicate openly and honestly about how her neglect hurts you. Tell her what your expectations are - tell her that you expect her to actively plan and follow through on these things, especially when you've been working so hard and took the day off.\n\nIt's up to her how she responds from there - but in the meantime you have to give her an opportunity to improve... Being snarky is only going to make you both feel worse.", "Stop your whining! You married her.

Do y'all even like each other?  You both suck.  Get counseling.", "Happy birthday! And NTA. I know I only have one half of the story, but from what you\u2019ve written it sounds like your partner passive-aggressively tried to ruin your birthday. That\u2019s a crappy present.", "This seems like a recurring theme in OP's life unfortunately", "And baking it in such a fashion to negate his suggestion of going out to dinner so he didn\u2019t have to cook.", "A lot of us know exactly how she can make it up to him. He'd get over his anger REAL quick. lol", "I don't think you're being petty nor passive aggressive. You had just hit your tipping point.

You\u2019re not an asshole for feeling hurt. Make sure you turn this into a constructive conversation where you kindly, calmly explain why you are feeling hurt.", "You're not being petty. She can't even get up early 1 day of the year for you - to take care of her own children?! And then it sounds like she sabotaged the rest of the day, *after* you ran errands for the family.

Bonus is you\u2019ll reject people who are hard on you.", "My gosh.... the bar is entirely too low. To think being allowed to bake your own cake and allowed to go out to eat on your own birthday being fine.... did you consider marriage counseling? I'm sorry but I can hear the resentment in your post and it sounds its been going on for a while. Your marriage is not headed towards a good place. Pls consider talking to your wife about finding a counselor.", "did you read the post properly? she didn\u2019t barely *say* anything, *she barely did anything, at all* - unless there\u2019s some major context being left out that explains why", "Sounds a lot like you just wrote another chore list for OP \ud83e\udd28", "Oh I know what I said was rude. Lol, I kinda just hit my tipping point", "He spent his entire birthday, that he took a day off for, getting ignored and passive aggressive attitude. He is perfectly right to be irritated and snap back at her. People have breaking points and it seems like his wife ignored him then got mad because he was celebrating his birthday without involving her. He was just responding to her behaviour.", "If that were on the table, she would have taken advantage of the empty house during the day", "He says she stayed quiet, the vibe I get from how the post is written is that maybe this guy is stressed out from work and dealing with the kids, so some vacay might be good", "I just said take a vacay, it's not a chore unless you make it so by overplanning haha", "she stayed quiet because she got her bullshit called out. she\u2019s mad he knew she was lazy and didn\u2019t plan a thing.", "Book a hotel, do laundry, pack for himself and his wife, plan meals for the kids and grocery shop for them, make sure the kids have rides to all their activities, and all their soccer uniforms and cleats and whatnot, get an oil change in the car, and do the tires need rotated? Put in for leave. Nag your wife to put in for leave. Probably repeatedly. Research things to do and places to eat. \n\nYou don\u2019t just \u201cgo\u201d on vacation", "NTA. Seems like the only way you ruined your birthday was by being married to someone who doesn't seem to care that it was your birthday or keeping her word.\n\nNext year, I would suggest you make plans for yourself and your kids to go someplace and have fun together. It might be a little extra work to go someplace like a zoo, but it seemed like you got nothing but extra work today.", "NTA, this whole post just breaks my heart. I hope you managed to do something for yourself. She shouldn't promise if she isn't going to follow through, or at least not be angry with you about it. \n\nI'd give her some slack if she'd messed up and apologized and made even a tiny bit of genuine effort. \n\nInstead, as someone else mentioned, it almost seems like she only baked the cake to be petty, especially since she did it in a way that negated your ability to go out to eat so you would at least not have to cook dinner on your birthday.", "Nta. I don't think your wife likes you.", "First of all happy birthday! Second, NTA. I\u2019m sorry. This sucks. I\u2019m hoping this was a massive miscommunication and she makes it up to you somehow (maybe planning a make-up birthday)", "Nta and you should have just went out on your own. Im sad that your day sucked.", "Info: does your wife even like you?", "INFO : you said that she was working when you came back. How long does she work? And usually, who take care of the daily chores? It's one thing to expect your wife to celebrate your birthday when she has free time on a weekday between the kids, work and house, it's another if she is taking care of everything and you want to add  special tasks just for you.\nPlus you left her alone for lunch, maybe did she plan to take you out without the kids for a surprise. You didn't ask her her plans and now you're mad because you rather go run errands than talk with her.", "NTA", " NTA", "I think you need couples therapy.", "NTA\n\nIf she cared she would have at least baked or ordered the cake the day before. Plus, she should have made a restaurant reservation and arranged for a babysitter a week in advance. \n\nI wonder if she\u2019s just selfish and lazy or is upset over something and is getting petty revenge. Her behavior in past years for special occasions is the answer", "NTA.\n\nYou need couples therapy or a divorce. This cannot last.", "So, what does she do all day? Does she work or contribute to the family in any meaningful way? You take care of the kids in the morning, you go grocery shopping, take care of errands and cook dinner. And she sleeps in every day. Sound like she was home all day? What was she going all day? NTA", "Same, breaks my heart. My dad was always a solid rock and my mom would always get defensive and notch things up to 100 if things didn\u2019t go exactly her way, even when she did literally no work and it burned the shit out of his soul. OP: you\u2019re not the asshole. I\u2019m sorry your wife isn\u2019t more attentive to you and your family life.", "Truer words have never been spoken!!", "Dude. You weren\u2019t petty. *she was*. \n\nAnd she was passive aggressive.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your birthday sucked and your spouse was a jerk. I hope next year is better.", "Also, if you put the cake in the oven at 6:45 it is definitely not going to be ready to eat before the kids are in bed. It has to cool completely before you can even frost it."]}
