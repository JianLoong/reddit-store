If even half of those in the back of the plane acted as you did, it would take twice as long to let everyone but the first three rows off. \n\nIf you find yourself where you think your personal benefit is equal to making it take twice as long for absolutely everyone, you are definitely an asshole. \n\n\nYou are bad at merging, too, betcha.", "YTA.

The social rules are simple and demand only basic courtesy and patience.", "Years ago I was on a flight that had been delayed.  We were at risk of missing our connecting flight.\n\nThe crew announced that there were several people who had to disembark immediately.\n\nWe were towards the back of the plane.\n\nHad to stand on two seats to yell to the front for people to sit down, so we could catch our flight.\n\nThe captain announced that nobody would be allowed to disembark if passengers did not sit and let us to has less than 15 minutes for our connecting flights get off the plane.\n\nGreat Alaskan Air flight that day.\n\nThey radioed ahead and our connecting flight was held. It was the last flight home that day.", "YTA. This is a classic situation where there's a clearly defined set of rules - people get off by row - that is essentially enforced by social convention. It's one of the purest ways of finding an asshole, because there's no ambiguity, everyone knows it, it's easy to see, and the only possible reason to break it is selfishness. Most likely people didn't get up immediately *because* they're assuming there won't be a flood of assholes trying to push past them.\n\nIt's actually an interesting contrast, because in places where it's assumed you just push your way through whenever you can, everyone gets up immediately to get a place and it's chaos. The polite, trust-based system works much better. Its main drawback is that assholes like you can take advantage of it sometimes. Sit down and wait, you're not a toddler.", "YTA.  You are right though, there aren't any rules about waiting, but it is common courtesy.  If too many people disregard this, then an already pain in the ass situation of getting off a plane will become worse with people 'competing' to get off first.\n\nThere's no rule about waiting in line to check out at a store, but it's common courtesy to wait your turn.", "Man I'll be near the front and still wait for everyone else to get off rather than be in the stampede.

I think that\u2019s important. \n\nPlane travel is global. If the rules are not printed or announced, then they don\u2019t exist. Especially because of cultural differences. \n\nIf one of my plane mates from Argentina were to be flying in the US how would they know what the \u201ccultural norms\u201d here are? \n\nIf someone from Argentina did what OP did, would they be an AH? It\u2019s the same behavior, after all.\n\nBut what you did say is that everyone would be jumping up and jostling and end up taking more time for everyone. And I\u2019m here telling you with first hand  experience that is not the case. So who is correct here?"]}
