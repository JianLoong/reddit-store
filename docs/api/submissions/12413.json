You're not going anywhere anyway. So sit your fuckin' ass down and wait for the people who need to get off to do so.\n\nEdited: Holy shit. The number of people who didn't read \"wait for the people who need to get off\" is ridiculous. Also the number of people who whine about having to sit in an airplane seat for 10 more minutes so that people with connecting flights or other needs can get off first.\n\nIf you need to stand, then stand and stretch, but this rush for the plane door ahead of everyone else is just selfish.\n\nEdited again: Yes I fly. I used to travel for business and flew 3-4 times a month. Now I fly 2-3 times a year for personal travel and vacation. Yes, I've been on international flights. Yes, I get that plane seats are uncomfortable. But rushing for the door the minute the plane rocks to a stop is still rude and selfish.", "YTA. If even half of those in the back of the plane acted as you did, it would take twice as long to let everyone but the first three rows off. \n\nIf you find yourself where you think your personal benefit is equal to making it take twice as long for absolutely everyone, you are definitely an asshole. \n\n\nYou are bad at merging, too, betcha.", "YTA. Many airlines ask people not to stand up and form a line in the aisle and just wait in your seat while the rows in front of you disembark.\n\nIf you had taken your headphones off, you might had heard the steward/ess mentioning it.\n\nEdit: Most US based carriers do not carry out this policy because they know a lot of the persons sitting in the aile are entitled AHs like the OP and they stand up exactly 2.5 seconds after the plane has arrived to the gate (or are people fed up with these AHs and stand up because they know they are rushing). Plenty of non-US carriers where people do not behave like spoiled brats when deplaning do follow the procedure of asking people to wait. In the case of BA, I flew Mexico City - London and then London - Glasgow on BA in 2021 and the flight steward did ask people to wait, specially on the second flight since it was a single aisle aircraft. Might have been COVID -related policies. \n\nI was also a consultant in my 20s flying +5 times a week, particularly with US-based carriers. I was totally the AH who would run at the entrance in less than 10 seconds just like the OP, so I don't believe for a second people just passively waited a couple minutes sitting down if the steward didn't asked them to. \n\nThen I married to a more patient and wise woman, had kids, needed to check overhead bins for 3-4 pieces of luggage and helped my family to stand up. And then I realized how obnoxious this behavior is.\n\nSo, even if your carrier of choice does not carry the waiting on your seat policy (but plenty do), YTA. \n\nThe only people who should move quickly for the plane entrance and be allowed to pass by other passengers are those at risk of losing their connections.

The social rules are simple and demand only basic courtesy and patience.", "Years ago I was on a flight that had been delayed.  We were at risk of missing our connecting flight.\n\nThe crew announced that there were several people who had to disembark immediately.\n\nWe were towards the back of the plane.\n\nHad to stand on two seats to yell to the front for people to sit down, so we could catch our flight.\n\nThe captain announced that nobody would be allowed to disembark if passengers did not sit and let us to has less than 15 minutes for our connecting flights get off the plane.\n\nGreat Alaskan Air flight that day.\n\nThey radioed ahead and our connecting flight was held. It was the last flight home that day.", "YTA. This is a classic situation where there's a clearly defined set of rules - people get off by row - that is essentially enforced by social convention. It's one of the purest ways of finding an asshole, because there's no ambiguity, everyone knows it, it's easy to see, and the only possible reason to break it is selfishness. Most likely people didn't get up immediately *because* they're assuming there won't be a flood of assholes trying to push past them.\n\nIt's actually an interesting contrast, because in places where it's assumed you just push your way through whenever you can, everyone gets up immediately to get a place and it's chaos. The polite, trust-based system works much better. Its main drawback is that assholes like you can take advantage of it sometimes. Sit down and wait, you're not a toddler.", "YTA.  You are right though, there aren't any rules about waiting, but it is common courtesy.  If too many people disregard this, then an already pain in the ass situation of getting off a plane will become worse with people 'competing' to get off first.\n\nThere's no rule about waiting in line to check out at a store, but it's common courtesy to wait your turn.", "Man I'll be near the front and still wait for everyone else to get off rather than be in the stampede.

Letting people go row by row and slowly get all their luggage in the overhead bins (some of which might not even be right over you) is what causes the congestion. Not the people with backpacks/small carryon only that are ready to go.\n\nI don\u2019t do it cause I know people will get mad. Plus someone\u2019s gonna end up holding the line up anyways and I\u2019m still going to be stuck waiting but I do wish there was a quicker way to get off.", "I'll do you one better. Almost every flight I've been on in the last few years even has the attendants say, \"please allow a moment for those with connecting flights to disembark first.\" So it's not as outlandish and uncommon as some of you are making it seem. It's common etiquette in flights.", "Exactly. \n\nI'm not asking anyone for shit. You're sitting in your seat. Get the fuck up if you want to be in line.", " NTA wth of course thats not a fucking rule, get off the plane if you want to get off the plane.", "Bruh I don\u2019t understand how so many people can call OP an A H.\n\nOP, NTA.\nIf they hadn\u2019t stood up yet, and all you have is a backpack? No shit it makes sense for you to get in line, if you\u2019re ready to get off the plane, be ready to get off the plane.\nFuck this \u201cit goes row by row\u201d bs, if you\u2019ve got your shit, you\u2019re ready to go, and there\u2019s space to get in the aisle without blocking/effecting other people, fucking do it.\nPeople take long enough to get off planes as it is, I ain\u2019t tryna wait around for grandpa jitter fingers to fumble in the overhead bins with his bag when I could already be up, past his row and near the front of the plane before the old fuck even stands from his seat.\n\n(FYI, no shit, I\u2019ve flown on planes, many times before)", "Right, but the places that can use two doors already do, so this isn\u2019t really a solution it\u2019s just the norm if it\u2019s an option", "Had to scroll WAY too far to see this. Thank you!", "Because the fuckers who pop up like a Jack-in-the box and hover over everyone else before the door is open keep other people from getting their stuff out of overhead and are in the way of folks who need to get off for connecting flights. When the jackass two rows back pops up and blocks the aisle by my seat, I can\u2019t get things down from overhead for myself and my kids. He (because it\u2019s always a he) successfully blocks the aisle and keeps others from being able to prepare to leave. Folks who are considerate get themselves ready to deplane then sit down until it\u2019s their turn. That makes it possible for everyone to access their possessions in a timely manner", "That makes the most sense. Waiting for an entire row to stand, get in the aisle and find their luggage is definitely not the quickest way.", "The fastest way is when the rear exit is also used. Has this just fallen out of fashion since the pandemic?", "1000% this. Why does it _matter_? If OP can get off quickly he's not holding anyone else up, he's actually just making it faster for everyone. Also we're talking about like 10 minutes while everyone deplaned. Seriously just slow down your lives guys.", "I worked for 36 years loading aircraft, 29 of them for a major US carrier and the cargo hold is rarely \"Mostly empty\". In fact they are normally pretty darn full. You speak about something you know nothing of and are just making an assumption. If they didn't charge for checked bags at some point (usually you get 1 or 2 free, depending on the airline) quite a few folks would show up with 7 bags and there would not be enough room in the hold for all the baggage.", "You don\u2019t. That is why people in backpacks still get caught by people climbing out ahead of them. But if you know you are going to take time to get your stuff. Just stay seated till the room opens up.", "Same, I never get up because I'm not in a rush but 90% of the people do. I just wait until it's clear.", "Frequent flyers in the US do it this way too. I live in NYC and we go by the \"European\" model.", "A lot of Europe is outside Schengen", "It absolutely does. You can see it when the line ahead clears out and someone steps in and takes time to get their stuff. Everyone behind is waiting when they could be disembarking.", "No, they\u2019re flying around with mail and cargo, not an empty hold. The cargo they fly subsidizes your ticket price", "Absolutely not true. If you go front to back, everyone has to wait for the people getting luggage out. and only one row can get their  luggage out at a time. Meanwhile if you let people who are ready to go, go (like backpack only people), less aisle space is taken up by people standing and waiting and more people can get their luggage from the overhead bin without blocking people from getting off", "This comment section is blowing my mind. Last month I flew with a one and a two year old. It took forever to get the bags and kids together to get off the plane. I would have felt like such an asshole if the single dude with just a backpack waited for me instead of just walking off the plane. \n\nThis sub feels like visiting another planet sometimes.", "Yeah I\u2019m not a flight attendant but I have been on flights countless times in my life, and I really don\u2019t see what the issue is here. It\u2019s not like he was pushing his way through people knocking them down to get off first lol. The aisle was empty and he went ahead. NTA imo", "Honestly, I hadn\u2019t considered the issue of pain from sitting (that\u2019s a blind spot I obviously have from being lucky enough to have a generally pain free body) so now that I\u2019ve learned that from your comment and others like it- absolutely. That makes a lot of sense. If your body is hurting and you need to stand up, of course. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t think of that.\n\nNot sure I agree it\u2019s rude to be unprepared to leave though, if you\u2019re not in the way of the aisle you can just wave people on. I\u2019ve done that before just because I was in zero rush.", "That was my thought, as well. OP goes to line up, but now  people in row next to where he is standing can't get up and get ready to leave because he is in the way. Personally, since I use a wheelchair that needs to be brought up from the holding area under the plane, I just wait until last to get off. An extra 5-7 minutes isn't going to make that much difference, unless you have a really short time to make a connecting flight."]}
