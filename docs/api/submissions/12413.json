If even half of those in the back of the plane acted as you did, it would take twice as long to let everyone but the first three rows off. \n\nIf you find yourself where you think your personal benefit is equal to making it take twice as long for absolutely everyone, you are definitely an asshole. \n\n\nYou are bad at merging, too, betcha.", "YTA.

The social rules are simple and demand only basic courtesy and patience.", "Years ago I was on a flight that had been delayed.  We were at risk of missing our connecting flight.\n\nThe crew announced that there were several people who had to disembark immediately.\n\nWe were towards the back of the plane.\n\nHad to stand on two seats to yell to the front for people to sit down, so we could catch our flight.\n\nThe captain announced that nobody would be allowed to disembark if passengers did not sit and let us to has less than 15 minutes for our connecting flights get off the plane.\n\nGreat Alaskan Air flight that day.\n\nThey radioed ahead and our connecting flight was held. It was the last flight home that day.", "YTA. This is a classic situation where there's a clearly defined set of rules - people get off by row - that is essentially enforced by social convention. It's one of the purest ways of finding an asshole, because there's no ambiguity, everyone knows it, it's easy to see, and the only possible reason to break it is selfishness. Most likely people didn't get up immediately *because* they're assuming there won't be a flood of assholes trying to push past them.\n\nIt's actually an interesting contrast, because in places where it's assumed you just push your way through whenever you can, everyone gets up immediately to get a place and it's chaos. The polite, trust-based system works much better. Its main drawback is that assholes like you can take advantage of it sometimes. Sit down and wait, you're not a toddler.", "YTA.  You are right though, there aren't any rules about waiting, but it is common courtesy.  If too many people disregard this, then an already pain in the ass situation of getting off a plane will become worse with people 'competing' to get off first.\n\nThere's no rule about waiting in line to check out at a store, but it's common courtesy to wait your turn.", "Man I'll be near the front and still wait for everyone else to get off rather than be in the stampede.

It\u2019s the same behavior, after all.\n\nBut what you did say is that everyone would be jumping up and jostling and end up taking more time for everyone.

I'm one of those who tends to sit and wait til near the end, as I'm waiting either on the plane or for my luggage.\nBut, if people are sorted and ready to go, grab your stuff and go. Clears space for everyone else quicker that way.\n\nI think the most efficient way to exit is people an entire length of the plane grab their bags out the top, get off, etc. As that had maximum people getting bags out the overheads at a time. Rather than doing it 2 by 2 down the plane.\n\nLots of dead time and waiting, otherwise.", "NTA. If it was a \"rule\" someone would have stopped you.", "NTA. Is this a cultural thing?

If everyone just stayed in their place in line, we could all get where we need to be more efficiently.\n\nYou could not be more wrong. Countless traffic flow studies have shown that the most efficient way is for drivers to use all open traffic lanes right up to the obstruction, then merge one by one. It\u2019s people who refuse to allow others to \u201ccut in\u201d because of their fragile egos that cause longer delays.", "I agree on your first point, then you lost credibility with your second point.", "\u201cI\u2019m a boomer.

At all.", "Just bc he did it doesn\u2019t mean that it was alright. Why should you get to push past all the folks politely waiting?", "I'll see your Europe and raise you Asia (spec China & Vietnam).  People are jostling for the aisle as soon as all wheels are on the ground.", "Lol, so you think if you just say you have a valid EU passport, you will be believed and can just waltz in and out of an airport anywhere?  There aren\u2019t always border crossing checks no but you definitely have to show your passport at an airport. Hence there are custom queues", "That\u2019s both true and not true. There\u2019s not nearly enough aisle room for everyone on a plane to be standing in it. Saying that, I frequently pull my stuff into my lap/seat and wait in my row while standing. While doing that, I offer to pull down bags for the people in my row/opposing row.", "In the year or so following covid BA was super duper strict about even standing up until your row was called. They deplaned in groups, and they\u2019d yell at you if you stood just to stretch your legs and didn\u2019t even step into the aisle but just stood where your seat was.", "I know for a fact that it was a part of the PAs on American Airlines during Covid, and that they no longer say it. I cannot speak for all airlines.", "I live in Europe now but traveled to see family in the States a few times during the pandemic. BA definitely had you deplane by rows during that time. Not anymore though. I found it a bit silly because the planes usually only had about 30-40 people on them and transatlantic plans are giant", "They were just sitting there because the people in front had not yet excited the plane so there was no where to go but to stand in the aisle waiting.", "Economy has 6 seats per row. At least every time I fly. 6 people can fit in a row sitting or standing at their seats. 6 people cannot however all fit standing in the walkway. If everyone got up so they wouldnt lose their place to someone like OP, the line would fall out the plane. There is not enough space for everyone to stand in their place in line so you wait for the line to move and merge. It\u2019s not an empty lane, it\u2019s a half way full lane with people idling ready to merge when traffic moves and some asshole speeds up in front of them and blocks traffic.", "If you have a connecting flight and you're cutting it close it's 100% understandable. If you are just a boorish ah trying to deplane faster, chill out", "Zipper merge only works if traffic is still moving. Once traffic has come to a complete stop people trying to cut to the front only make it worse.", "Zipper method for the win.", "But nobody DOES use zipper merge.  Instead people start refusing to let others merge, while the people who need to merge start squeezing in where there's no room (I drive in Tampa every day, this is the norm here).", "Yeah except there's always one person who ignores that, roars along to the very end of the closed/filter lane and then tries to barge their way in forcefully because they saw it as an opportunity to get ahead. I know what the zipper method is and I know 95% of people use it. Still doesn't mean there isn't someone who thinks it doesn't apply to them and they can merge right at the last second.", ">Doing that literally makes it take half as long\n\nThat's incorrect. The speed is determined by the total through put at the narrowest point, not the shape of the queue. The only reason that zipper method is preferred in traffic is the length of the queue obstructing other traffic, like crossings etc. It has nothing to do with the actual speed.", "Sounds like a you problem.", ">It\u2019s people who refuse to allow others to \u201ccut in\u201d because of their fragile egos that cause longer delays.\n\nExactly right, If people did the zipper, it wouldn't be a problem", "Yes. Step dad is spot on.", "I mean he wasn't shoving people. And this was what I experienced since I was 10yrs old and no one said anything or gave looks.

Where do you live? Because it works exactly as I said.\n\nI\u2019m a UK citizen and I live in Italy. When I fly, I have to show my passport to get on the plane. When we land, we go straight to baggage claim. They don\u2019t check your passport, they don\u2019t ask your nationality, nothing. I\u2019ve flown to France, Germany and Spain so far this year for work - no passport checks.", "When boarding yes you have to show a passport or ID, but when you land in another Schengen country then you just go straight out. Same as an internal UK flight for example.", "BA definitely did ask this, but it was a Covid precaution, which is why it\u2019s probably not in any of their current official practices. I travelled a lot during the pandemic (for work) and most European and Asian airlines asked passengers to stay in their seats until it was time for their row to disembark. Some even announced when it was your row\u2019s turn to leave. The flagship US carriers did this for a while, too, but it was more short lived for them. \n\nI actually liked the practice, but I think it was tough on the crew as they had to constantly content with passengers who did not want to follow the rules.", "Not what I was acknowledging", "How can you tell the difference?", "How do you know why someone is doing that?", "Zipper merging is precisely for traffic that is just crawling along. It's not like people are suddenly just doubling the traffic density of a lane at 25+ MPH.", "I find traffic stops in the situations because AH\u2019s refuse to zipper merge and stomp the gas to drive on the shoulder so they can be \u201cfirst\u201d and it is rude. Yea drive to the end and zipper merge but don\u2019t ignore the people giving you space to merge that are waving you over in order to get 3 cars ahead. This impedes the flow of traffic.\n\n(Sorry, had nothing to do with the post)\n\nYes OP is an AH, courtesy and rules apply to everyone and lately a lot of people forget that.", "Traffic literally only comes to a complete stop *because* people don't use the zipper method.", "Zipper merging is literally merging at the last second. You think everyone knows some rule like 'ok everyone is supposed to merge exactly 68.2 feet before the lane closes or else they're an AH'? No. Doesn't work like that. \n\nI mean sure if the guy ahead of you merges into his spot early it's not like you just got a license to zip ahead of everyone else, you go in where you would have gone in anyway. And if you're courteous you creep along and don't merge until the last 10 feet of road so that traffic can regain the maximum benefits of having the 2 lanes for as long as possible. But does anyone really care if you merge within the last 20 feet of the closed lane or the last 5 feet? I think not.", "Oh ok. Next time I'll fight the people.", "Not according to staff on flight? Or have they been misinformed too?", "Be observant? If the front rows are standing up and not the folks near you, it should be a tip off that it\u2019s not the norm to stand up yourself and go ahead.

You don\u2019t say, \u201cI only have a couple items, so I\u2019m going ahead of the folks with full carts.\u201d Same thing.", "Wtf dude are you talking about?", "I\u2019m from Ireland and I definitely got checked getting off the plane, but I\u2019m not sure if it was something that happened in the past and they changed the rules or is it something they only occasionally do?\nEither way it was done quickly, just a quick glance at your passport.", "Yeah I said in another comment that BA did do this by rows during the pandemic. I just meant now they don\u2019t and prior to 2020 they didn\u2019t", "Okay have a day as lovely as you are", "You can tell the difference because normal human beings would say something like; \u201cexcuse me, would you mind if I go through first because I have a tight connection\u201d. \n99% of people would have no issue letting you by. \nComing from a frequent work traveler who has had to do this on numerous occasions.", "Many flights make announcements for it.", "If that's your only solution, I fear for your critical thinking skills. Good luck, definitelyyourproblem666", "Again, no one ever said anything or gave us looks to ever tip me off. Every time I was on a plane, almost everyone would do this. I have had different experiences then I guess what is the norm. From my observations, nothing was wrong because everyone else was doing it and no said anything. I don't know what else to say at this point other than, I guess I learned something new today.", "Put your beer down and try to join the dots, mate.", "That makes sense, because Ireland isn\u2019t part of the Schengen Agreement.\n\nThe Schengen countries are: Germany, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland", "Ok? So just assume in good faith if the flight is making an announcement for people with connecting flights to deplane that the people deplaning have connecting flights. Again. How do you tell the difference?", "I typically choose an aisle seat (easier for me to get up to go to the bathroom without disturbing people, slightly broad shoulders so middle and window seats are crowded, etc.) but the biggest downside is at the end of the flight, some assholes ALWAYS stand up and wait to exit the plane and crowd the aisle. They stand inches away, often bumping into me with their bodies or bags. I\u2019ve had asses shoved into me while they jostle around. I\u2019ve also noticed that you have to jump up as soon as the row ahead clears because if you don\u2019t, people behind you will try to walk out first. And as soon as one goes, they\u2019ll all try to go. \n\nJust wait your turn.", "This guy is the bad egg, and if his entitled attitude spreads to other travelers people with connecting flights will miss them.
