The social rules are simple and demand only basic courtesy and patience.", "Years ago I was on a flight that had been delayed.  We were at risk of missing our connecting flight.\n\nThe crew announced that there were several people who had to disembark immediately.\n\nWe were towards the back of the plane.\n\nHad to stand on two seats to yell to the front for people to sit down, so we could catch our flight.\n\nThe captain announced that nobody would be allowed to disembark if passengers did not sit and let us to has less than 15 minutes for our connecting flights get off the plane.\n\nGreat Alaskan Air flight that day.\n\nThey radioed ahead and our connecting flight was held. It was the last flight home that day.", "YTA. This is a classic situation where there's a clearly defined set of rules - people get off by row - that is essentially enforced by social convention. It's one of the purest ways of finding an asshole, because there's no ambiguity, everyone knows it, it's easy to see, and the only possible reason to break it is selfishness. Most likely people didn't get up immediately *because* they're assuming there won't be a flood of assholes trying to push past them.\n\nIt's actually an interesting contrast, because in places where it's assumed you just push your way through whenever you can, everyone gets up immediately to get a place and it's chaos. The polite, trust-based system works much better. Its main drawback is that assholes like you can take advantage of it sometimes. Sit down and wait, you're not a toddler.", "YTA.  You are right though, there aren't any rules about waiting, but it is common courtesy.  If too many people disregard this, then an already pain in the ass situation of getting off a plane will become worse with people 'competing' to get off first.\n\nThere's no rule about waiting in line to check out at a store, but it's common courtesy to wait your turn.", "Man I'll be near the front and still wait for everyone else to get off rather than be in the stampede.

I'm one of those who tends to sit and wait til near the end, as I'm waiting either on the plane or for my luggage.\nBut, if people are sorted and ready to go, grab your stuff and go. Clears space for everyone else quicker that way.\n\nI think the most efficient way to exit is people an entire length of the plane grab their bags out the top, get off, etc. As that had maximum people getting bags out the overheads at a time. Rather than doing it 2 by 2 down the plane.\n\nLots of dead time and waiting, otherwise.", "NTA. If it was a \"rule\" someone would have stopped you.", "NTA. Is this a cultural thing? I live in Europe and have travelled internatiinally a lot, and people just get up no matter what row they are on.

Sometimes there will be a large gap between you and the car in front of you, but if you\u2019re doing it right, they should start moving again right before you reach them. \nWhat you\u2019re doing is absorbing the braking waves. \nEvery non-self driving car is driven by a human. We each have a reaction time. We don\u2019t all simultaneously brake together. Car 1 brakes, car 2 sees the brake lights and brakes a second later, car 3 isn\u2019t paying attention and brakes 3 seconds later, etc. \n\nIf you go the average speed, then there is less braking and you remove each individuals reaction speed from consideration. Everyone behind you is able to also go at a slow but constant speed. \n\nThis breaks up the traffic jam.", "This this this! Yes a little signage to help guide the zippering!", "You're not wrong.
