Instead of energy spent on what won't happen, let's try to change what you do have control over.  Ask you first child's father to not send your child with 'games' or electronics or whatever.  Do get board games or cards or books that your children can play together.   If that is not of interest, have all of your children work with you making a meal together, sharing time at a playground, going to a free event in your community.
