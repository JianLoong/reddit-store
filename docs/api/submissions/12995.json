My mom's husband has a daughter the same age as me, Kerrie. Kerrie's mom is a shitty person and last year my stepdad learned that his ex stole from Kerrie and took all the money my stepdad had saved for Kerrie's college. Kerrie was upset because she really wants to go to college and what she wants to do means like 8 years in college. She wanted to have as much help as possible but now it's all gone.\n\nThey've been talking about it a lot and my stepdad tried to find a way to get more money, since even though he pressed charges against his ex, the money is long gone and there is no way to get it back. My mom asked me if I would be willing to share the money dad left me for college with Kerrie and she told me how good of a sister I would be to help her after being betrayed by her mom. That I didn't need to but it would mean so much to everyone. I told her I didn't want to share the money with Kerrie. Mom said okay, but then wanted to know why. I didn't tell her the whole truth initially and told her I just wanted to keep the money for me, since it was saved by dad, and what he wanted for my future. But she didn't really buy that from me and a week or two later asked me again. So I told her the truth. That Kerrie and I are not close, we are not sisters and I don't want to help someone in such a huge way when I really don't care about them or even care if they're in my life. Mom told me she was surprised I felt that way. Then I pointed out she and her husband have known for years. That they used to point out how we never interacted like siblings. She told me she figured we still loved each other in some way. I told her I didn't anyway.\n\nMom then told me I was wrong to refuse to help for that reason. That whether I like it or not we are siblings/family and Kerrie deserves to have this. She told me I was being very selfish and she would hope my dad would be angry at me for not embracing Kerrie as a sister despite our issues and not helping her. Then she told her husband what I said and he was pissed at me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679583902, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zn53k/aita_for_refusing_to_share_some_money_with_my/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Set it up so that you have to be there in person to withdraw, etc.", "Also your father\u2019s parents wouldn\u2019t release the money for you to give to step sister even if you wanted to. It is for your education and future. Step dad can remortgage the house and use his retirement savings if he wants to help K. He can sabotage his own future rather than yours. Your mom would have received an inheritance from your dad as well- that can go to K if she is feeling bad.", "Tell them about what is going on and that you don't want to share.", "Thank god for that. Your mother would totally raid it from the sounds of it I\u2019m afraid", "That\u2019s such good news!  Please talk to your grandparents, OP and tell them what is going on and that your mother is trying to manipulate you.  Then they can protect the money in case she tries to do an end run around you and appeal directly to them.", "Since that\u2019s the case it technically isn\u2019t even yours to control yet, so even more of a reason why your mom is being an AH trying to guilt you into using it.  \n\nHer and your stepdad need to file a suit for the money to get the bio moms wages garnished and start making lifestyle changes to build the savings up again. You don\u2019t need to do anything except make sure your grandparents don\u2019t let your mom anywhere near it. You\u2019re NTA here.", "Yay! Make sure you have your own bank account for the money which no one else can access.", "He reported it but suing was kind of useless because she wasted it all on stuff that cannot be sold to get the money back.", ">but suing was kind of useless because she wasted it all on stuff that cannot be sold to get the money back.\n\nHer wages can still be garnished, liens can be put on property...\n\n\"It's useless\" is an excuse.  Go sue her in small claims court.", "It totally sucks they can't squeeze blood from a stone but again, it's not your job to fix that. The money is gone, and while that really sucks for her, it's not your job to fix. They need to either sue her for it, push any option they have to get the money back and in the meantime come up with a contingency plan. Scholarships, working on loans, possibly parental loans, figuring out if a work-study job is something she should be focused on. \n\nYour dad didn't know her and would have wanted you to focus on you. Take care of yourself first."]}
