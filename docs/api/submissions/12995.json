My mom's husband has a daughter the same age as me, Kerrie. Kerrie's mom is a shitty person and last year my stepdad learned that his ex stole from Kerrie and took all the money my stepdad had saved for Kerrie's college. Kerrie was upset because she really wants to go to college and what she wants to do means like 8 years in college. She wanted to have as much help as possible but now it's all gone.\n\nThey've been talking about it a lot and my stepdad tried to find a way to get more money, since even though he pressed charges against his ex, the money is long gone and there is no way to get it back. My mom asked me if I would be willing to share the money dad left me for college with Kerrie and she told me how good of a sister I would be to help her after being betrayed by her mom. That I didn't need to but it would mean so much to everyone. I told her I didn't want to share the money with Kerrie. Mom said okay, but then wanted to know why. I didn't tell her the whole truth initially and told her I just wanted to keep the money for me, since it was saved by dad, and what he wanted for my future. But she didn't really buy that from me and a week or two later asked me again. So I told her the truth. That Kerrie and I are not close, we are not sisters and I don't want to help someone in such a huge way when I really don't care about them or even care if they're in my life. Mom told me she was surprised I felt that way. Then I pointed out she and her husband have known for years. That they used to point out how we never interacted like siblings. She told me she figured we still loved each other in some way. I told her I didn't anyway.\n\nMom then told me I was wrong to refuse to help for that reason. That whether I like it or not we are siblings/family and Kerrie deserves to have this. She told me I was being very selfish and she would hope my dad would be angry at me for not embracing Kerrie as a sister despite our issues and not helping her. Then she told her husband what I said and he was pissed at me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679583902, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zn53k/aita_for_refusing_to_share_some_money_with_my/", "score": 543, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So make sure its protected.", "No, and unlike your mother, I don't think your father would like how she behaved towards you. He left that for you.\n\nYou can't save everyone who has been betrayed by their parents.\n\nAnd even if you did, I wouldn't even bet on getting help or money as recognition in the future if you were the one needing help. Maybe they would be appreciative, but you can't even count on that.", "I feel like you should point out your mom and stepdad's hypocrisy here: \"Oh no, someone stole Kerrie's college fund and that's horrible ... so to 'fix' the situation we'll just \\*take it from OP's inheritance/college fund\\*\"\n\nWhat happened to Kerrie's money is terrible. Shaming you into giving over your own money to make up for it is terrible. Forcing you to explain your reasons in detail then shaming you for that is terrible. I'm sorry that all of the living parents in you and Kerrie's lives are terrible.", "Her mother stole from her and now your mom wants to steal from you??", "Yeah, \"you don't have to\" she said. And then guilt tripped you into oblivion. NTA, put your foot down.", "Fyi, your mom is also being a shitty person, just one notch above Kerrie's mom.", "At least you'll never have to see her again", "Let me put it this way,  your mother is basically saying,  \"her mom was shit and silly her college fund,  I wasn't too be just as terrible and take part of yours too make her feel better\"\n\nSo to make her feel better she wants to steal part of your fund", "If you give up money then her mother will end up stealing from you since it\u2019s your money being taken.\n\nDo your grandparents (Dad\u2019s side of the family) know that your mom wants you to finance step sibling\u2019s education?", "Absolutely right. NTA", "Her father also failed her big time by leaving that money in a place that her mother could access it and take it.  Not your fault for what both her parents did and not your responsibility to give her half of your money for college.", "Your father was a smart man.  \nThis is the reason why other family members control  the money", "Whew. I was worried that your mom/stepdad could unilaterally yank that money away from you. I've seen that scenario a lot on Reddit. That money was left to you from your deceased dad for your college education. Don't give Kerrie a dime. \n\nIs there any chance you could live with your grandparents? Because I don't see this issue stopping anytime soon. They will keep hounding you about money that isn't theirs. BTW, NTA.", "This shows that your dad wouldn't have wanted you to share with your step-daughter. I guess he left the money to his parents instead of his wife to avoid she used it for something else than YOUR education.", "That's great! When you turn 18 can you leave it with them until you need it for college?", "Let your grandparents know what your mother asked you to do.   So they won't take her word when she goes to them and claims you said it was okay to give money to your stepsister.", "Speak with your grandparents (Is this your paternal or maternal grandparents) and let them know what is going on and not to let you have access to it unless it is for your own use (with proof. If needs be) as they are trying to guilt/coerce you into using it for your stepsister.", " \nYour mother and her husband are cruel and manipulative people.", "No, come on. Mom is being an AH for guilting OP but she\u2019s clearly not attempting to steal lol", "OP-- this this this  do make sure your grandparents know that folks are scheming on that money now and they have to be careful.", "Aren't those all things she can do on a banking app? I mean I sure my withdrawal and swipe to the minimum amount allowed if I'm not sure where my bank card is. My app even allows me to pause my card so it can't be used until i unpause it.", "He should sue her, from what I am reading here, since it was more than I am assuming 3000, ,I guess it goes to federal court  and her wages will be garnished, or she\u2019ll go to prison, with that kind of incentive, she might just find some money somewhere. That\u2019s the avenue to success your SD should take, not your bank account which again like people are saying, get all kinds of passcodes installed, multiple verifications, all  the works to protect YOUR money. , Your mother shouldn\u2019t have even asked you for this imo. NTA.", "sure, but that doesn't mean that the advice to check into measures like that is not good, there may be other things necessary to protect the account from the guardians of the minor. Completely wise to check all the circumstances and ensure that somebody who ordinarily would be assumed to have OP's best interests at heart cannot get her money.", "In the US, small claims court has maximum amounts based on your state. In some states, it's $3,000. It's certainly better than nothing, but that wouldn't cover one semester of college.", "They will never recover a penny from an unemployed alcoholic/drug abuser in small claims court, where the max limit is going to be far lower than 8 years worth of a college fund...\n\nYour advice sounds very nice, but come on...think realistically.", "She doesn't have a job. She's an alcoholic and she's been on drugs for years. Pretty sure she hasn't worked the whole time my mom has been married to my stepdad.", "Commenter said 'once you're 18' so the advice is for when OP is no longer a minor. Also OP's natural guardian is not in charge of the money nor does OP control the money until she is 18 meaning she can't make any banking decisions at the moment - her grandparents decide. \n\nUnless OP's mom intends to defraud the bank by pretending to be OP's grandparents, she cannot access the money. If the let's her access the money based on any assumption, they are liable hence banks don't work on assumption - they work on who legally has control over and access to the account", "They need to speak to an attorney unless they are just blowing smoke. There are 3 levels of civil court depending  upon the amount involved.", "So your stepfather knew she was a jobless alcoholic addict and still let her have access to the money? This is not a you problem at all- this is a him problem. He fucked up and now expects you, his minor stepdaughter, to fix his fuck up. That's not on you at all- he can co-sign loans for his kid.", "This right here. If he was the one saving why does ex have access?"]}
