My mom's husband has a daughter the same age as me, Kerrie. Kerrie's mom is a shitty person and last year my stepdad learned that his ex stole from Kerrie and took all the money my stepdad had saved for Kerrie's college. Kerrie was upset because she really wants to go to college and what she wants to do means like 8 years in college. She wanted to have as much help as possible but now it's all gone.\n\nThey've been talking about it a lot and my stepdad tried to find a way to get more money, since even though he pressed charges against his ex, the money is long gone and there is no way to get it back. My mom asked me if I would be willing to share the money dad left me for college with Kerrie and she told me how good of a sister I would be to help her after being betrayed by her mom. That I didn't need to but it would mean so much to everyone. I told her I didn't want to share the money with Kerrie. Mom said okay, but then wanted to know why. I didn't tell her the whole truth initially and told her I just wanted to keep the money for me, since it was saved by dad, and what he wanted for my future. But she didn't really buy that from me and a week or two later asked me again. So I told her the truth. That Kerrie and I are not close, we are not sisters and I don't want to help someone in such a huge way when I really don't care about them or even care if they're in my life. Mom told me she was surprised I felt that way. Then I pointed out she and her husband have known for years. That they used to point out how we never interacted like siblings. She told me she figured we still loved each other in some way. I told her I didn't anyway.\n\nMom then told me I was wrong to refuse to help for that reason. That whether I like it or not we are siblings/family and Kerrie deserves to have this. She told me I was being very selfish and she would hope my dad would be angry at me for not embracing Kerrie as a sister despite our issues and not helping her. Then she told her husband what I said and he was pissed at me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679583902, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zn53k/aita_for_refusing_to_share_some_money_with_my/", "score": 1389, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
