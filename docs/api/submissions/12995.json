My mom's husband has a daughter the same age as me, Kerrie. Kerrie's mom is a shitty person and last year my stepdad learned that his ex stole from Kerrie and took all the money my stepdad had saved for Kerrie's college. Kerrie was upset because she really wants to go to college and what she wants to do means like 8 years in college. She wanted to have as much help as possible but now it's all gone.\n\nThey've been talking about it a lot and my stepdad tried to find a way to get more money, since even though he pressed charges against his ex, the money is long gone and there is no way to get it back. My mom asked me if I would be willing to share the money dad left me for college with Kerrie and she told me how good of a sister I would be to help her after being betrayed by her mom. That I didn't need to but it would mean so much to everyone. I told her I didn't want to share the money with Kerrie. Mom said okay, but then wanted to know why. I didn't tell her the whole truth initially and told her I just wanted to keep the money for me, since it was saved by dad, and what he wanted for my future. But she didn't really buy that from me and a week or two later asked me again. So I told her the truth. That Kerrie and I are not close, we are not sisters and I don't want to help someone in such a huge way when I really don't care about them or even care if they're in my life. Mom told me she was surprised I felt that way. Then I pointed out she and her husband have known for years. That they used to point out how we never interacted like siblings. She told me she figured we still loved each other in some way. I told her I didn't anyway.\n\nMom then told me I was wrong to refuse to help for that reason. That whether I like it or not we are siblings/family and Kerrie deserves to have this. She told me I was being very selfish and she would hope my dad would be angry at me for not embracing Kerrie as a sister despite our issues and not helping her. Then she told her husband what I said and he was pissed at me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679583902, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zn53k/aita_for_refusing_to_share_some_money_with_my/", "score": 2111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This mom is a piece of work.", "OP- I have two children, and I've been very clear in event of my fresh that my money only helps my children and no one else.  You're not wrong that your dad only wants you to have this money for it's my exact sentiment also for my children.", "Plus, if the tables were turned, would she honestly do that for you? Guessing no", "It's so tragic to me that people have to spend their final days trying to safeguard what they are leaving to their children from their co-parent, but cases like this prove how important it is. This shit just breaks my heart. Imagine not being able to trust your spouse to take care of your kid and not prioritise someone else in your absence?    \n    \nI'm glad her dad had the foresight to entrust the funds to his parents, but so sad it's necessary. This whole story is just awful.", "As a father, I would be furious with my former wife, not my daughter. OP is NTA, your dad specifically wanted that money to go to you for you, no one else. You have NO obligation share.", "I completely agree I could never imagine putting some new relationship or new kids above my dead partners wishes it\u2019s fucked up I can\u2019t believe it happens as much as it does", " This is because they are trying to manipulate op", "Exactly. The way OP's mom tried to emotionally manipulate her is so creepy. She would take money her dead husband left for their daughter to help her husbands kid? That's crazy!!", "people get money out of banks all the time. my buddy's ex wife tried 11 branches of the bank over a period of like 7 months before she found one that would let her at her ex husband's money(little over 100k). Apparently, she refined her story a little bit every time until she worked out what she needed to say. He likely will get the money back from the bank, but it's been 2 years and he has thousands in legal fees (which, he will probably get back) but it's not quick and he's had to jump through a lot of hoops. And if he hadn't had the resources to hire his own atty's...?  Who knows whether he'd ever get it back.  Had any of the branches that denied her (they had fully determined that an ex wife was fraudulently trying to access her ex-husband's accounts so they wouldn't let her) reported this or flagged the account or done anything- she would have been caught. Putting fraud alerts on the account and taking any extra available steps to secure them is absolutely warranted and should be investigated immediately. Why would you just assume it's safe and do nothing when you can take reasonable steps to make sure?"]}
