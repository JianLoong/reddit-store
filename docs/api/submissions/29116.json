I'd tell him that this trip is a reward for his sister excelling, and he can use it as an incentive to work hard and get to go on those trips too when the moment comes. He's not entitled to just go on a trip out of jealousy. I fear that if you cancel in favour of your son's wish that 1) this would be seen as favouritism of your son and 2) daughter will become disillusioned and it can ruin your relationship.

My wife stayed back with my daughter and they had some quality time together. My daughter stayed up and waited the night we got back to hear her brother talk about his trip. Did it sting that she didn't get to go? I am sure it did but not everything is always going to be equal in life. We weren't going to stop her brother from going because her trip got ruined by an international pandemic and my daughter understood that. I have also taken some solo trips with my daughter.

Should your parents have screwed over your sister because you were a brat growing up? No. You even admit she deserved it and that now you understand it and laugh about it.

This is why i wrote to \"try and be in a 14yo shoes\" to understand my yta comment, at that age teens are jealous, angry and resentful when their sibling gets something and they don't, that's how it is. And i believe that buying somenthing nice to the boy (if op has a good financial stability) wouldn't be screwing up the sister. And the same thing could be said for my situation,  desperately wanted a new smartphone that was around 400euros, and if  my parents (that were quite well off) bought me that, it would not have been a problem for them and wouldn't have screwed up my sister's trip. Now that i'm 27 i'm glad how they dealt with me, i'm independent and well off myself, but i still remember that i gave my parents the cold shoulder for the entire summer over that situation and only started behaving well when they assured me in front of the enlarged family that at my graduation i'll also get to have an amazing vacation as a gift, and they kept their word.

I understood your comment. I understand it even better now that you admit you were the same type of brat when you were growing up. The thing is that you don't seem to understand my comments. And now you're agreeing with OP. They literally explained to him that he could have the same trip. That wasn't good enough for him. What's worse is you admit that your parents handled it correctly, but you keep saying they should show the brat favoritism, giving him expensive gifts to avoid him throwing a tantrum.", "Sadly, life is like that. If we cannot accept it, we are in for a lifetime of disappointment. As one of my senior boys replied when another boy complained something was not fair, \"Where on your birth certificate does it state you will always think things are fair?\" \n\nThis was not a case of \"tough luck, deal with it.\" It was a case of a deserving person being rewarded and another person demanding to be rewarded equally but had done nothing for which to be rewarded.", "So he should be rewarded every time his sister accomplishes something?", "Except it's not the \"tough luck, deal with it\" approach. They explained he could go on the same trip if he takes a language and goes with his class.", "I don't agree with Op if they decide to just tell the boy to shut the f up and deal with it, that approach never ends well, even doing something special for him that's not necessarily expensive would be a good solution to preserve the relationship and don't make him feel excluded. Yeah brats are a pain in the a$$ to deal with, but is the parents duty to do that, and i just give op my opinion/suggestion based on my experience.", "Given how the boy reacted, it's exactly how he feels it is, either the parents do something nice or they use the good ol' belt to bring him to reason, otherwise he'll be holding a grudge for some time, which is also fine.", "And where did they say that? Oh right, they didn't. And no, rewarding him for not throwing a temper tantrum is not an appropriate way to deal with his bratty behavior.\n\nAs for your experience, you say your parents did the right thing. Why are you saying OP should do something different?", "What utter nonsense.\n\nOR they explain to him again that he can get the same trip if he works as hard as his sister did. A belt. What a joke. Just because your parents only had \"buy something or the belt\" as their options for your upbringing doesn't mean everyone does."]}
