Tell him to enjoy California and he\u2019s welcome to sign up for a school club or activity that takes a trip when he\u2019s 17, you\u2019ll even probably help.", "NTA. Open a (or multiple) conversations with your son. his sister has earned this and it wouldn\u2019t be right to take her away from that experience. help him to understand the envy/jealousy and that\u2019s normal, but can he be happy for his sister?", "If daughter went on a trip at age 14 son might have a case. Oh wait, she didn't, so he doesn't. We'll chalk it up to being a teenager and not call him an A H, but OP is certainly NTA.", "NTA\n\nMy sister and I both applied to a school trip once\n\nShe got it (had way better grades than me) and I didn\u2019t\n\nDid it suck?

You earned it!", "Lol what the fuck", "Holy damn, that escalated quickly.", "I'd tell my 14 year old he \"gets to go to\" class. That's how sis earned her trip.so if he enrolls in the same type classes and if he does well he too can obtain the same trip\n It wouldn't be \"fair\" to just give him   the award when he didn't even apply himself to the work.", "What the pear. Orange u glad I didn't say Apple", "Agreed: he has the next 3 years to earn it himself.\n\nIs at fair that she probably has her driver's license and he doesn't? Or that she gets to go to college next year and he doesn't? Of course not.", "I also agree here. Title reminded me of the recent post about twins-girl chose a trip as opposed to her Quinceanera while twin boy got nothing. That was unfair as hell. This is not. \n14 year old needs to wait and earn a similar trip.", "But here is the issue how do they know if they will be in the same Finacial position   three years from now", "My HS English Dept offered a trip to England but I missed out signing up b/c they didn\u2019t promote it heavily. I found out after the deadline and was bummed... But the trip was cancelled due to Desert Storm. \n\nThey offered the trip a few years later but I had already graduated. My younger brother was still in HS at the time and when my parents went to the info session to get him signed up, they mentioned how they had to find a way to break it to me gently. The teachers said no reason for that, I could go too.", "That sucks, some people are just not meant to be parents. I am proud that you decided to do whats right for you and went and got your hard earned degree (assuming you graduated already).

I hope you enjoyed yourself.\n\nMy brother took so many more trips than me, between boy scouts and a boy's choir that performed all over the world, in addition to the 'high school language' trip. Was I jealous? Of course. I only got the language trip and, despite it being the same language we had very different itineraries only three years apart. My parents didn't really think about trying to make it up to me (at the time. We've talked about it since and I get help from them in different ways) but I still love my brother and don't resent him for the opportunities he's had.\n\nOP needs to talk to his son about the differences between equality and equity, and how sometimes gratification (even on earned rewards) is delayed. Is this a kid who demands their birthday presents always be equal also? His sister can't get makeup (if she wants it) because he doesn't like it? That's just as ridiculous.", "I didn't say she had to send him on a $2500 trip.\n\nLet the kid go have a sleepover or go fishing or whatever. \nHe's obviously craving something fun to do.\n\nAn adolescent or teen who still wants to do family stuff is G-damn unicorn in my book.\n\nAsk grandma to take him on a trip.", "Exactly all i was saying is that OP needs to tell his son life is not fair thats it not promise him anything", "Lol he doesn't want to go fishing with Grandma, he wants to go on a rad trip somewhere \"exotic\". Which he can do in 4 years after he's spent the time learning a different language. \n\n\"Take him fishing or he's gonna be a drug addict\" is so absurd. He's a jealous teen.

I personally know lots of drug addicts that never get over ANY disappointments...", "Why are you using knowing a lot of drug addicts as a flex", "Ok... personal experience then. \n\nMy 23-year-old A-student daughter took up drugs. \nAlso, then took up drug dealing to my cousins to afford her drugs.\n\nShe said it was cuz I \"missed her band concert\".\n\nYup. True story.\nKids are petty like that.\n\nYou argue her pothead rationale...\n\nBut you'll probably say weed isn't a drug (illegal in Wisconsin where she's dealing,  so)", "Is this the same daughter you said you abandoned because her father has held a grudge against you?  \n\nSo you think any disappointment can lead to drug use?  Yet you think a kid who is jealous over a trip to Costa Rica won't be disappointed if his trip is fishing with Grandma?  Interesting.", "Oh geez.  Shut up you little brat. Your sister worked for it.  Sorry for some reason that triggered me. NTA, but I might be.", "NTA.  He's not 17 so it's a moot point.  Unless you sent your daughter on an exotic international trip when she was 14, then his complaint is not valid.  Also she's going on a SCHOOL trip.  Not a FAMILY vacation.", "NTA - she is a senior, he is a freshman.   If he earns a spot on a trip as a senior, he will get his chance then.", "Tell him that if he works hard and is selected to go that for sure you\u2019ll send him on a trip.", "Dude $2500 for 15 days in Costa Rica is cheap", "I agree he should get a trip when he's older, but I don't know why everyone links trips to grades. It is probably best for everyone to get to experience other cultures. \n\nI was the smart kid in school and in my family. I think it would have been really shitty of my parents to prevent my siblings from going on a trip because their grades weren't as good as mine. \n\nIf he has serious problems and becomes a drug addict or something, yeah, spend the money on therapy. If he gets mediocre grades, let him go.", "NTA", "NTA - she earned this trip. Sounds like he hasn't even made an effort. Don't give in, this is a good parenting lesson about entitlement.", "NTA.  Please don\u2019t give in to your son.  This is your daughter\u2019s opportunity and a good time for your son to lean life isn\u2019t always fair.", "NTA. Its good for her education and her future. He should do those classes when hes that year if he wants to go on a holiday lol id offer to put money an extra curricular tho, if he wont take classes that do stuff like that. Then they both have a lil bonus thats catered to them as people and not just because they want something the other one has out of jealousy lmao", " \u201cWhen you\u2019re 17 and you\u2019ve taken a foreign language, I\u2019ll pay for a trip for you also.

You will not be getting a present because you have not graduated high school but you will when you do graduate high school.\u201d", "NTA so long as he will have an equal experience in the future (he might not be interested in a foreign language trip specifically.) You would be playing favorites if you gave her an experience like this and didn't give an equivalent but different experience to each kid.

She earned it. I think you have a good plan. There is no favoritism here. You would be treating your children equally if you required your son study a language to earn a trip too.", "YWNBTA.  Different ages, different times in their lives, different rewards, different kids.  Has your son shown signs of being jealous and spoiled before?  Don't punish your daughter because you don't want to say no.  Instead tell him if he does the same (excelling in school)you'll pay for a trip for him when he's 17.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a school function for students of Spanish. If he wants to take a trip to another country, he should take a language that the school organizes trips for. He has exactly the same opportunity, and if he doesn't take advantage of it, that's on him.", "NTA. She earned the privilege. If he wants something like that he can earn it too. It's not favouritism unless/until He earns an honour like this and you refuse to fund at least $2500 to allow him to participate. Up to that point your son is flying false flags.", "Well, isn't that nice.. He wants you to pay for an exotic family vacation!! Lol. If you did that...YWBTAH. It would be like telling your daughter that all her hard work was for nothing and all she really had to do was demand a trip. She worked really hard in Spanish, and it's a school trip!! If he wants a trip funded by you, tell him to tackle something at school, and when a school trip for him happens... you will gladly allow for him to go. Geesh.. he's pretty entitled. I'd nip that in the bud now.", "NTA. This is a school trip, not something you just up and planned for your daughter. I\u2019m sure if he also had a school trip you\u2019d be happy to pay for it. 14 is old enough to understand that.", "NTA\n\nHe's a whiney 14yo. He'll get over ot. Maybe he can study French and go to Montreal.", "NTA", "NTA, she earned her trip and she IS older!  Tell him that if he works hard too he can earn a trip with his language class.

She earned it.", "NTA when he has done years of a foreign language and gets selected to go on a trip then it will be his turn!", "NTA. Kids do not need to receive gifts at the same time. You seem like a sensible person attempting to do something positive for your child. I will advise, however, that you are opening a door for \"scorekeeping\". You'll probably be told that it's your money and you can do anything you want with it, but you will likely need to actively involve yourself in ways you can promote every child's life equitably.\n\nSpeaking as a person whose brother receives every handout imaginable from my parents. So consider that as bias.", "NTA. Why are you letting a 15 year old kid sway you on this,  when it is so clear? When he works towards something for years and has this opportunity, you'll make it happen for him too. What is not fair is letting him make decisions for your family from a place of jealousy, and taking something from his sister. His sister earned an opportunity that you could afford. He should get started, if he wants the same chance. Stand strong and don't be manipulated.", "You know the right answer here. NTA. Different kids get different opportunities. Good for your daughter for earning the opportunity! I hope you\u2019re not at all considering not letting your daughter go and taking a family trip instead. Then you WBTA.", "He didn't put the work in. \n\nShe did. This is her reward. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. He has the opportunity to warn the same thing,  so you're treating them the same.", "Just curious. Who's accusing you of favoritism? If it's your son, tough luck buddy. Work really hard and in three years you can go too. Sounds reasonable to me. If it's someone like dad or grandparent then guess what? If they want him to go on a fancy vacation, they can take him and pay for it. You sound like a great parent and you and your daughter at least, have their priorities straight. Bravo. You are NTA and tell whoever doesn't like it I said so.", "Yep. This is no different than explaining to my younger niece why she received less money for her birthday than her sister. I explained that I gave $x to kids until age 10 and then they got $z. Older sister was 10 so she got the higher amount. As soon as younger reaches 10, she will also receive higher amount. Her response? \"Oh, okay\".", "Lol when something wasn't fair between me and my younger sister and she whined about it, my dad used to sing \"Issues oh issues\". Got everybody laughing", "So, I volunteer at my kid's school, and this week we have a Big Special Field Trip for JUST the big kids. I've been hearing a LOT of complaints and jealous comments from the younger kids that it isn't fair. \n\nI told them all the same thing: They've been looking forward to this for a couple years, same as you. You'll get to go next year."]}
