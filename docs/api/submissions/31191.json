It will be a relatively small event - 40ish guests - and a fairly small venue. We sent out our wedding invitations at the start of October - we do not live close to most of my family so we wanted to give people time to arrange to travel if needed. In our invitations we requested nobody brought children under 16.\n\n Generally, I love kids. My girlfriend has a son (12m) who I have been raising with her since he was 4 and I've loved it, and I would love to have more someday, but to me (and my girlfriend) weddings are a stressful and expensive day, and children only add to the likelihood that something will go wrong - I've been to weddings/parties and seen parents drunk or distracted and accidents can happen, people can get hurt or things can get broken. \n\nDespite this request, we have generally prioritised our loved ones being there over this rule, and have agreed to make exceptions. Our own son shall be in attendance, as will my two nephews (16m & 13m), my girlfriend's half-brothers (15m & 13m), and my girlfriend's childhood friend's daughter (14f). \n\nHowever, we have not agreed to make an exception for my sister \"Becca\" (31f). This is for two reasons;  \na.) her children are very young (5f, 3m & 2m) and are more likely to cause issue and need constant supervision than any of the teenagers.  \nb.) in 2016 she also had a child-free wedding (strictly 18+) and made no exceptions for our other sister \"Darcy\" (35f) and I despite knowing that we had children. At the time we of course accepted that this was her decision to make, but as a result Darcy and my girlfriend missed the wedding as we were unable to find/afford childcare alternatives.\n\nBecca and her husband are furious at me, insisting that we were all much younger back then and it was 'weird' that Darcy and I had children so young, but now it is more expected that we all have children and so my rule is ridiculous. She is saying it is unfair that I am making an exception for Darcy and not for her - which might be true, but I still think I am justified since her children are so young and therefore likely to cry/scream/throw tantrums, and she had no sympathy for us when she was the one hosting a child-free wedding. \n\n My father has refused to get involved but my mother has sided with her and wants all her grandchildren in attendance, and thinks I am saying I love Darcy's children more, which is not my intention but I can see why it looks like that.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I continued to not allow my sister's children to attend my wedding? \n\nNote: all names are fake names.

Children ages 2,3 and 5 are far different than children over 12. Your wedding , your rules. I would be prepared for her to show up with the kids.", "NTA your wedding so ur choice. She is def an AH for not allowing them at her own but thinking she is entitled for hers to come to your wedding. Also there is an obvious difference between 5, 3 and 2 year olds and teens as they do know how to behave", "NAH. \n\nYou are well within your rights to want a wedding without trouble and that\u2019s why the 16+ rule was set, that\u2019s something that Becca probably understands. \n\nHowever, the trouble comes when you\u2019ve made exceptions for all the children apart from her\u2019s, if it was a different limit, like 12+ or if you didn\u2019t make any exceptions she would be more understanding. But to her it feels like everyone\u2019s kids but her\u2019s are allowed and that might make her feel singled out. \n\nIf you can manage to work with her and if her children are well mannered then maybe you both can come to a compromise, but in the end it is your wedding and thus it is your decision who attends it.", "Why did you set \u201cunder 16\u201d as the limit, and then allow a bunch of kids who are younger than that? You made things much more difficult for yourself than if you had simply set an age to include the kids you want & exclude the ones you don\u2019t.  \n\nBecca still wouldn\u2019t be happy, but at least there wouldn\u2019t be all this talk about exceptions.\n\n\ufffc", "You\u2019re wedding, your choice absolutely. \n\nSadly there is a bit of mixed messaging due to the exceptions. You shared that you wish you\u2019d done the -12/13 rule in retrospect. But when you had the -16 rule, you were making all sorts of exceptions. \n\nI will say, all the \u201cchild free\u201d weddings I\u2019ve been to, the only kids that have been immediate family of the couple (kids, direct nieces and nephews). Culturally for us, siblings kids are seen as an extension of their siblings. Ex. My sisters kids I see as my own (should anything happen to her, I\u2019ve got a very close relationship with them), and culturally my son and her kids refer to each other as brothers/sister (we have \u201ctitles\u201d to emphasize this in our culture\u201d. So I am a bit biased based on traditional family values from my background.", "YTA for the way you went about this. An exception for everyone except her? You should have just made the age limit lower. She\u2019d likely still be upset about this but it\u2019s not so pointed. Weddings are not tit for tat.", "NTA. She does not like the rules when they applied to her. Sucks to be her", "It\u2019s a wedding. Not a family reunion. You are in charge of who is invited. Period.

Your sister had a strictly child-free wedding and kept to that (barring any children in the wedding party). You are having a kind of child-free event with a lot of exceptions, except for her, and using this as a way to express your distaste for her child-free event years ago. Also, you gave people a very short amount of time to both make travel and childcare arrangements. She has three kids who all need care. \n\nIf you wanted her there, something like hiring someone as a child-minder for a travel required event would have been a way to show it. It would have also helped out other guests.", "NTA. There\u2019s a huge difference between a teenager and a young child. It makes sense why you don\u2019t want the younger kids to come. However it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re still harboring some resentment against Becca for having a child free wedding. You need to let it go. Your son and nephews were pretty young when your sister got married. She didn\u2019t want children at her wedding for the same reason you don\u2019t want them at yours. There\u2019s no need to be resentful.", "lol I am generally opposed to child free wedding rules if they apply to family.  Generally for this exact scenario.  In any case you should drop the child free rule but exclude her kids specifically.", "NTA  No children under 12 is often a cut off point. If she wants her children at a wedding she can reaffirm her own vows at a second wedding and have her children there. Bet she wouldn't think that was such a great idea.", "NTA. Just say the brides son will be the youngest person there.", "Your mother can have all her grandchildren at a wedding when she gets married again. This is not her call to make.\n\nTell your sister that she had a childfree wedding and you two didn't protest. The same rules apply to her now. Find childcare or don't come.

Most teens are capable of behaving themselves at a wedding and are able to stay awake later. Younger children need to be supervised and subject to melt downs.", "Yta. I don\u2019t ever feel sorry for people who decide on child-free weddings and then want to know if they are TAH when problems arise because they chose a child-free wedding \u2026 duh. But this situation is worse. You insist on a child free wedding and then make exceptions for a bunch of children, making it obvious who you are excluding. I mean, do you not see how it looks?!?", "NTA- hire security, cause you know either sis or mom is going to try to sneak the kids in.  I would also be blunt and tell them straight out that if either of them try to bring the kids in that security will remove them. Then tell Mom this is YOUR wedding and if she doesn't like the no kids rule then don't come.", "YTA.  \n\nYour desire to have a perfect wedding where nothing goes wrong (despite being a common flaw) is in itself a weird and neurotic behavior that is probably yielding a bunch more drama you haven't mentioned.  Weddings are not inherently stressful or expensive.  I had more guests than you and my wedding cost $2000 to feed them all in my parent's backyard.  Being a big old weirdo and trying to plan a perfect event where absolutely nothing can go wrong is stressful and impossible and not fun.  \n\nYTA but you're also free to invite and not invite anyone you want to your weird wedding and ruin your family relationships and achieve nothing outside of alleviating your imagined fears of hypothetical situations that are not real and have not happened.", "Better, don't allow your hypocritical, disrespectful sister to your wedding. \n\nNTA", "Fuck it dude, sometimes in life, you just go ahead and be the bigger person, even to a jerk who has wronged you before.

No, no it's not, and you probably already know that, right?\n\nYwbta, so just don't, even if it's justified.", "NTA, but for consistency sake, you\u2019re making exceptions for kids 12 and up, so maybe just say that instead.  That said, your sister\u2019s kids are much younger, and though it certainly can seem like you\u2019re being vindictive, she did the same thing with no apparent exceptions. She\u2019s just mad to be on the other side of it.", "Child free weddings are a thing. It\u2019s a thing to have a handful of teens who can hang out together and leave everyone alone but these are babies / barely toddlers. She can get a babysitter for the night. NTA.", "YTA. \n\n1) it\u2019s family. The rules about not having kids is insane if you care about having family. If you have family coming there\u2019s gonna be kids. Unless you\u2019re in like some \u201cchildren of men\u201d scenario.\n2) of course you\u2019re making exceptions for everyone under the sun. Because your rule is stupid, YOU ALREADY HAVE A KID, and also no1 above. So basically the one person you\u2019re not making an \u201cexception\u201d for is your sister. \n3) basically what you actually have is a rule that your sister can\u2019t bring kids.

You SAY that not allowing Becca's kids isn't \"payback\" -- yet you also admit it's one of the two reasons you're not willing to make an exception for her kids.  Personally, I'm not a fan of the combo of destination/ travel required weddings with \"child free\" weddings.  It's asking a huge investment of time and money and inconvenience and then topping that with the logistics of finding childcare in another city when most of your \"go to\" sitters are at the wedding. \n\nI'd be curious to know if Darcy is still holding a grudge against Becca over having to sit out the wedding or if their relationship is fully recovered.  \n\nI'm also not a fan of \"unequal\" exceptions to the iron clad rule. \n\nFor example a child free wedding where the bride and groom's kids--or siblings--or all niblings are allowed is a reasonable exception.  A \"child free\" wedding where some niblings are allowed or some friends' but not others' kids are allowed is bad form and a recipe for bad feelings.", "NAH or maybe ESH but you're being petty for no reason. In 2016, all the kids you mentioned were under way 10. That's much younger than the kids you're allowing at your wedding. And that's about the age Becca's kids are now. There's nothing wrong with saying no kids under 10. Kids that age need a lot more supervision than kids over 10. \n\nThere was nothing wrong with Becca not making exceptions for very young children at HER wedding.  If she can't find childcare, she will miss your wedding, just as you had to miss hers. But, yeah, she shouldn't be throwing a fit because you're putting the same restrictions on your wedding that she did.", "What could really go wrong with 40 people come on and it sounds like it's mostly friends and family like who cares. Personally I understand the whole child free thing but as you grow older family is kind of really important. Maybe you should just have all your family there. I mean it is about you guys but it's so small. I get it if there's over a hundred people and you're worried about children not being looked after, but I'm sure she can watch after her own kids. I think it would be perfect if you were all together to share such a beautiful moment. Unless you know they're going to come and eat your cake before it gets cut, maybe then that would be a funny story right? Cute moment. I've learned to not control things. Just let life happen. Enjoy it. Let them support you.  Did your sister or other family also leave you out when you had your 4-year-old with your girlfriend because it was an inconvenience for them  as well??", "Okay, look. You can invite or not invite whoever you want, but saying no kids under 16 and then making *several* exceptions is kinda shitty.\n\nIf I were your sister, I would see that as if you made the \"rule\" (quotes because it's not an actual rule with so many exceptions) specifically to keep my kids out. It makes complete sense for her to be insulted, though she cannot demand that you invite her kids.\n\nObviously, your girlfriends son needs to be there. His mother is getting married. However, if you're going to have an age related rule, you need to pick an age you can stick with.\n\nESH", "NTA, it's your wedding, you can exclude whatever nieces and nephews you want.  YWBTA if you stilk expected your sister to come to the wedding or not to have any consequences over having other family children except your sisters.  Does sound more tit for tat to be honest, but you do you.", "Nta there's a huge difference between a teenager and a 5 year old", "NTA Your sister is an entitled brat and your mother enables her. This is your wedding. You do you. Have fun. You said your piece. Tell them the conversation is over. There will be no further discussion.", "NTA for not wanting younger children there, completely understandable but you went about it terribly. As others have said, should have set the age limit appropriately instead of \"kids not allowed but direct family's kids allowed and one bestie's daughter allowed but not that one sister's\". I also note that you've said a few times that you didn't realise you could do this because your experience has been different but frankly, if a genuine oversight, that's daft because your wedding, your rules.\n\nAlso, kind of a soft YTA for one of your given reasons (as stated by yourself) being because \"sister did it to us first\", this shouldn't be a reason at all so don't bring it up in any discussion, it'll bite you hard. Given the former, I can understand why that one sister took it personal tbh, however, I stand behind the decision to not have younger children at a wedding unless they are direct descendents of the bride and/or groom if that's what the couple choose and as long as the main reasoning for this is not simply because your sister did it to you first.\n\nAlso though, the sister whose kids aren't allowed sounds like she's digging herself a hole with some of the stuff she's coming out with to defend her position so I'd also call them a bit of an AH and would recommend just leaving it at young kids aren't coming, end of story, her choice if she still wishes to attend without hers or not and understandable if she's unable to as your soon to be wife was unable for hers. I'd also rationally and politely explain it to your mum a similar way and request that she stop interfering with how you and your wife to be wish to celebrate, it's not mum's family gathering, it's your wedding.", "NTA but five or six exceptions (I wouldn't call your own son an exception, but he is under 16) is asking for trouble. With  40ish people attending, it could well be that Becca's kids are the only ones excluded. \n\nYour wedding, your rules, make it under 12.", "NTA. Your sister doesn't get to make the rules gor your wedding. She wouldn't make an exception for you so shouldn't expect one now.", "NTA, it is your wedding. you are allowed to make as many or as little exceptions as you want.", "NTA. I\u2019m petty for life", "NTA \n\nYoda: \"Shit is like boomerang, it is. Throw it and return, it will.\"", "NTA your sister makes up a lot of excuses why she could be asshole and you can\u2019t it\u2019s your wedding you make up the rules as she did", "NTA.  Your wedding and your guest list.  She\u2019s an asshole for being a filthy hypocrite", "No 5 yo want to go to a wedding. It\u2019ll be boring as\u2026 for them. Your sister set the precedent with age limits, so she has no reason to complain. \n\nAnd - child free is whatever you make it.   There\u2019s a difference between a child and a teen.", "You should have picked an age on your invites bud. Now you look like a meanie. Good luck getting out of this one.", "NTA.  Tell your sister you will miss her if she chooses to stay home. That is it. It doesn't matter what she did; this is your wedding and you are having it the way you want.  Your mom can have a party with ALL her grandkids at another time.", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding, your rules. \n\nThere's a huge difference in ages here. The kids you're allowing are teens and an almost-teen.  They're pretty civilized by then. Becca's kids are basically toddlers; even 5 year olds can't be relied on to stay on best behavior for long. \n\nYour best response to Becca is \"No little kids at the wedding. If you can't get a sitter, we understand. We'll miss you.\"", "NTA. First just tell her that you are open to having children there but they have to be 12 and older. And that you are sure she can understand, as she had a no kids wedding. That your event is not going to be catering to small children. \n\nTell your mom, that this wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9 and not about what your mom wants. That if she wants a wedding where all her kids are invited, tell her to have her own renewal. She can pay for it and have whom ever she wishes.\n\nWarning, I\u2019m betting that your sister will show up with her kids in tow, and your mom will contribute to the fiasco. So have someone there to escort them oht", "\"Sorry, we only make exceptions for 12 and over, we will not go any lower then that\"  \nNTA", "NTA - you all made an exception for teenagers who can handle themselves.  that is all you need to say- your wedding you & your fianc\u00e9\u2019s decision.", "Please just elope and have a blasted picnic in a park with your family and friends afterwards.  The stress will be gone and the cost will be a lot less.  The only people who need to be at weddings are the bride, groom, officiant and two witnesses.  I hate the way celebrities and the Hallmark channel have made everyone think they have to waste money to get married!", "Becca should understand since the rule was in place for her wedding.    You cannot please everybody, so don't try to.   Do what is best for you and your fiance as that is what it should be about.   NTA", "Yes, the way he did it makes sis feel like it is revenge.", "How is she hypocritical and disrespectful?  Sister had no under 18 with no exceptions whatsoever.  OP has a no children rules, but with loads of exceptions for 'loved ones' , which obviously does not include the younger nieces and nephews.  That sounds far more disrespectful tbh.", "OP this is yours and your girlfriend\u2019s wedding, not your sister\u2019s or your mother\u2019s. Any compromising should be only for differences in opinion between you and your fianc\u00e9e! \n\nYour mother is being enormously disrespectful to your fianc\u00e9e by getting involved.\n\nYour sister is being a huge bully. It\u2019s not compromise, it\u2019s allowing a bully to steamroll you. The hypocrisy of demanding you allow her young kids yet she didn\u2019t at her own wedding is incredible. \n\nPlease don\u2019t alter your no-young-kids, which is a norm at most weddings anyway, just to appease your sister! Plus you already know she wouldn\u2019t do that for you!\n\nEdit: forgot to include NTA", "Trust me they won\u2019t leave", "Hypocritical because the sister didn\u2019t have young kids yet she\u2019s mad her own very young kids aren\u2019t invited to a wedding.\n\nAnyone complaining to a bride and groom about their wedding is flatout disrespectful.", "Don't do it NTA and call your mother out for her favoritism twords your sister. \n\nAsk her why it was ok for you to Skip your sister s wedding then and she said 0 and now all of a sudden it's not ok .\n\nI would tell her she can be there for you at YOUR+YOUR FIANCE EVENT or not ,her choice, but at your wedding no kids under 13 will be present period.\n\n\nYour mother is welcome to set the rules at EVENTs SHE PAYS AND ORGANIZES ONLY.", "Another great reason that many people have child free weddings is because they want their guests with small children to take the night to be fully present and enjoy adult company. It\u2019s more difficult for a person with 3 kids under 5 to be totally engaged with the matter at hand, which is completely understandable. There\u2019s nothing wrong with either way of doing things! \n\nOh I will say\u2014I think the courteous and generous thing, if you\u2019re going to have a child free wedding that people have to travel for, is to arrange group childcare in advance. I\u2019ve attended a few weddings where the bride and groom hired 3-4 people to watch all the kids of guests in a hotel room or somewhere easily accessible to the wedding so that parents could be close to their children but enjoy the party without worrying about them. For children in a family it\u2019s arguably more fun than a wedding anyway! Slumber party vibes."]}
