OP does not see him as a parental figure. Giving away the bride is a viewed-as-a-parental-figure role. Why should OP have to compromise to give in to an adult who was not even there for half her minor life, who, again, she doesn't see as a parent?

She has been both your mother and father. She is the one who kept your dad alive. It\u2019s very sweet of you to ask her. \n\nHe was not a parental figure, just the man who made your mum happy. There are other roles he can do on the day. The person who walks you down the aisle is a parental figure. \n\nThis is your wedding day, not his. It should be how you want it to be. \n\nI got married in a week, to be able to include my late grandfather who was due to pass away (less than a month later he left us) - he was the best, he walked me in.

It is clear that the stepfather is feeling unappreciated and a little disrespected when he has participated in your upbringing.  You aren't an AH, you have the right to have the wedding you want, it's your day after all.  However, he does deserve to be acknowledged for his contribution.  That's reasonable.  I might sit and talk to him and let him know I care about and appreciate him.  I wouldn't want something to be unsaid but you have agency and can determine the appropriate action.  For you edification, men operate on respect.  It is very important and making men happy is related to respect.  Guys form such strong friendships because of it and it underpins the entire structure of a mans internal being.  That's why so many men are checking out these days, society at large no longer has any respect for us.  We keep the entire western world functioning, after building it all, and no one cares anymore.  I know, boo-hoo.  I'm not saying that though, I'm just trying to help you understand.  It may not really make sense to you.  Women are held together by other things.  I think that's why we struggle sometimes, men and women.", "Totally agree and now I\u2019m kinda teary eyed!\n\nAlso I had both my parents walk me down the aisle, bc the idea of having just my dad walk me felt wrong when my mom was way more emotionally supportive", "[deleted]", "Geez.

She\u2019s not obligated to let him do anything.", "NTA. 'Stepdad' is gross because he's making your wedding all about him.

I sometimes  think its weird when people that didn\u2019t raise you have assumptions about the roles they\u2019ll play in your wedding without talking to you first. It can be a little nuanced and people might get their feelings hurt, but it\u2019s weird to get mad about. \n\nHe became your stepdad at 11, which isn\u2019t super early in your life. I think it\u2019s so sweet that you want your mom to walk you down the aisle. Maybe he was expecting a shout out, which I might talk to him about if you think he deserves one. He probably views it as a role for a man and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so off put by it, but your mom is largely the one who raised you and deserves that honor. He should really get over himself. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be too hard on him either. Sounds like he got in his head and got upset. However, I dislike the fact that your mom\u2019s in laws got involved.

He said; \"unless I'm getting two cows and a goat to trade for you at the other end, what's the point? However, if you want an arm to lean on because you're terrible in heels, I love you and would be honoured to support your ankles.\" He made it clear that he doesn't agree with the concept of *giving away* women. Dude is now late 60s, so you can't really argue it's a generation thing. I'm genuinely shocked that other men kick up such a fuss! Stepdad and all the inlaws need to pull their heads in and get a grip on reality.\n\n\nSounds like your mind is made up but if you're stressed enough to be asking reddit, and if you're not that far into planning stages, I've known people who ask their mothers to be \"matron of honour\" - that way all the bridal party pics include her!

His and anyone else's opinions don't matter.", "NTA.\n\nTotally different situation, but at my wedding we requested that guests not bring small children/toddlers because we got married on a lake and were worried about safety. I mean literally on a lake, bride \"walked down the aisle\" on a boat, the dance floor was a floating platform and guests got to take paddle boat rides. It wasn't a popular decision to not allow children, but it was our decision because it was our wedding. \n\nIt's your wedding so you and only you get to decide who walks you down the aisle. Your wedding day is about you and your future spouse, celebrating your love and your future life together. How you celebrate the occasion is entirely up to you.\n\nYou don't say why your step-dad was upset by you asking your mom to walk you down the aisle. From the context of your post it sounds like he was expecting to fill that role because it's traditionally done by the \"father of the bride\". On the other hand perhaps he was expecting to walk you down the aisle because he does see himself as your father and had the expectation that he would walk with you at your wedding?\n\nRegardless, congratulations on your upcoming wedding!", "NTA\n\nShe has been your mother since your birth.

It\u2019s not like he wasn\u2019t invited, or won\u2019t be sitting at the table.

Look, you\u2019re not required to do anything, and Reddit is fond of the scorched earth version of no compromise. I suggest you find a compromise. Because OP? While you may want to emphasize your moms importance in your life, shutting him out of a traditional role in front of their family and friends that are in attendance is going to be viewed by people who are special to your mom as you rejecting him, and will cast doubts on him as a husband and partner. It will do your mother an equal amount of public disrespect to dishonor her partner in front of her family and there won\u2019t be an opportunity for a do-over later . The damage will be done.\n\nMay I suggest a compromise I did at my wedding? My father was there and also my moms husband. I asked him to dress in the same formal wear as the rest of the wedding party.
