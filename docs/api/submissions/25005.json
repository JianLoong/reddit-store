Even if he did all those things OP has been clear he DIDNT DO, he still would not be entitled to the relationship he wants.

Regardless of how the woman feels? Regardless of the fact that she neither chose this man nor asked him to be in a relationship (just like OP). \n\nAnd it\u2019s even worse with a step parent because, if you choose to marry someone with kids, you are morally obligated to treat those kids well, because you chose that life. Those kids did not choose you and they don\u2019t owe you anything. \n\nJust because you TRY HARD doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to a relationship that the other person doesn\u2019t want.", "My judgment stands, she is TA.\r\r  \n\r  \nAnd he was there.

I\u2019m fierce when pushed. I don\u2019t know who they thought they weee trying to argue with, but I walked down the aisle alone. I was a daddy\u2019s girl.

It is also your wedding, your choice. As for the point about him having provided for you and such, that is just dead. Sounds like your mother was doing fine providing and raising you on her own.", "He didn\u2019t do anything. OP has stated multiple times that their mom parented them solely, and her stepdad was mostly just a partner to her mom and not a dad. That\u2019s completely fine as the arrangement clearly worked for them all, but he can\u2019t demand the honor of walking her down the isle when he was never a father or father figure to her", "Yeah, the poor guy seems like he was just disposable. I mean she gets to do her wedding however she wants but he sure got a message about what this person thinks about him.", "Yeah poor guy probably thought he had a daughter.", "He's not contributing financially to my wedding.", "NTA. Have your mom walk you down the aisle and have a wonderful wedding. If your stepfather chooses not to enjoy your wedding, that's his loss.", "He cannot demand anything. You are correct.\n\nHe probably just feels like he sad he has wasted 14 years of his life trying to be a stepfather to his stepdaugther who never saw him as one.", "Then NTA.  If he was, I could see how he would feel bad that you would gladly take his money (as a daughter) but not include him."]}
