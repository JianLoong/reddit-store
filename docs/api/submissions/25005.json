My dad has been MIA in my life for a long time, my mom passed 3 years before I got married or I would have done the same. Instead my 2 brothers got to step into the role.", "NTA\n\nIt does sound like your mother is happy to do those things for you but check with her - only because one of my colleagues had her daughter ask her to walk her down the aisle and she wanted to be 'mother of the bride' and not both as she had been throughout her daughter's childhood\n\nThis doesn't mean he should be the one to do it, but check with her that she wants to", "That's exactly how I feel. She has been there and done so much for me. Every step of my life she's been a part of and has offered me endless love, support and guidance on my journey.

After all, she's the one who has been there since day one and she has done more for me than any other person on this earth. For years it was just the two of us and she did as great then as she did when she remarried. I'd like to think most people would be able to see that of everyone in my life my mom is the most deserving.", "Not acknowledging him as a parent doesn't mean she doesn't like him. Just that she considers her mom to be the one that actually raised her. Even mom is fine with him not being treated as 'father of the bride', which indicates she knows what type of relationship they had. OP is NTA for wanting to honor her mom.", "So OP's supposed to give into every little tantrum her stepdad is going to throw? Way to show OP his true colors", "He did not assume the role of a father. My mom did all of those things. He was more of a backup in the household and a partner to my mom and someone who could be there if I needed him for support.

Why should you be  limited to just a mother daughter dance?\n\nWalking down the aisle - could get join halfway? Like he stands halfway as your mother walks you down the first half and he joins both of you in the middle and the three of you then walk down to the altar.", "\"He was more of a backup in the household\" - That's says a lot about your thoughts on him.\n\nYou do not consider him a father, you were ok with him doing father duties for 14 years, and you are telling him by your actions that you don't consider him a father.\n\nAgain, action have consequences, do not be suprised if he never sees you a daugther after this.", "The reason I chose to just do my mom is because she has been there for me always. She has done the most and I'm the closest to her and if I was being totally honest, I consider her my sole parent. So the idea of a father/daughter dance with someone I do not consider a father feels weird to me.", "Why does she have to compromise? \"No\" is a full sentence and stepdad should stop throwing his little tantrum and just enjoy being part of her life.", "But he hasn't been doing father duties for 14 years. My mom is my parent and she took the lead. She was there for everything and doing everything. He was support but he was not equal to her. I also never claimed him as a father in my life.", "Ok, then all can be direct and clear. You are not his daughter, he is not your father.\n\nYou should not expect anything from him from now on, and he should not expect anything from you.\n\nFor 14 years he probably lived a lie thinking otherwise.", "Woah you need to calm down, step relationships are incredibly complicated. And from what i've read she has been thinking about this before he was even fully in the picture. she NTA", "And whose fault is that? Even if he did all those things OP has been clear he DIDNT DO, he still would not be entitled to the relationship he wants. You don\u2019t get to buy a relationship with someone. \n\nDo you also think that a man that puts in a lot of effort trying to have a relationship with a woman is automatically entitled to that relationship? Regardless of how the woman feels? Regardless of the fact that she neither chose this man nor asked him to be in a relationship (just like OP). \n\nAnd it\u2019s even worse with a step parent because, if you choose to marry someone with kids, you are morally obligated to treat those kids well, because you chose that life. Those kids did not choose you and they don\u2019t owe you anything. \n\nJust because you TRY HARD doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to a relationship that the other person doesn\u2019t want.", "My judgment stands, she is TA.\r\r  \n\r  \nAnd he was there. For 14 years he was there. And now she is saying you are not unwanted.\r  \n\r  \nHe is not entitled to anything, she is free to do whatever she wants in her wedding day. And she can still be TA for the way she dismissed that person who was in her life for 14 years.", "Who's talking about buying anything.\n\nHe assumed a father role from the age she was 11. And by that, it means he probably took her to school, helped her out with her studies, etc, etc..\n\nIt's not all about money, it's about being there for her.\n\nAnd he was there.

What do you mean \"not a parent just my mothers husband\"?\n\nWe are talking about OP's case. 14 years is not 14 days. If they were together as a family, he was talking a role in being more than \"mother's husband\".", "I mean my step father was there from when i was 13 but never really tried to be a parent to us and it sounds like this is the case with OP, sorry i know i'm not explaining this well half asleep."]}
