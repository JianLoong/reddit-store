This past week we got into an argument over something (that I thought) was silly. I said something about him being lazy, which he took personal. I understood I hurt his feelings, took accountability and apologized. He didn\u2019t want to talk to me for about a couple days. Friday night comes and he decides to go out with his brother. Fine. I don\u2019t press him about it that night, and the next morning he finally comes up to me and apologizes for the way he\u2019s been acting. I accept his apology, and ask him how his night went. He says he went to go dancing at the club, had a few drinks and stayed up with his brother venting. He didn\u2019t come home until about 3-4 AM. A few days later, I was using his google maps and it shows that he looked up directions to the strip club. This made me upset, as I had asked him how his night went and he completely omitted the fact he went there. So I decide to confront him. I asked him if he had gone to the strip club and he said yes. I then asked him \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d And he says \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t want to\u201d. I told him I didn\u2019t like that he went to the strip club behind my back to look at and spend money on other women, and he immediately gets defensive and starts telling me \u201cwhy does it matter? I should be able to do whatever I want\u201d and he even goes to say who am I to take away experiences from him and tell him what he can and can\u2019t do. He says it was because he needed a \u201csafe and quiet\u201d place to be able to vent to his brother. At this point, I\u2019m more upset at the fact that he got defensive and dismissed the way I felt. I told him he knew it was wrong if he never told me about it in the first place and he goes back to being defensive. We\u2019re both pretty open with each other and don\u2019t keep secrets, so the fact that he kept it behind my back until I confronted him hurt me. At this point I feel like the situation hasn\u2019t been fixed, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to get into an argument again.", "created_utc": 1694143809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16czhwi/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_dont_want_him_going/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I suggest putting your feelings about the strip club aside and focus on the bigger underlying issue that seems to be festering right now.\n\nTo your actual question:  No, you are not wrong to be upset about the club\u2026 That is some thing that partners should discuss before hand to make sure they are both on the same page.

Work on that.", "ESH\n\nYou suck because even though you did apologize, you did insult him and he did and probably will still take it personally. \n\nHe sucks for going to a strip club without telling you.
