{"id": 18496, "submission_id": "13v6s25", "title": "AITA for not paying my GF rent?", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been dating my girlfriend \u201cAnna\u201d (she\u2019s 28) for a year and half. I\u2019m 26 years old. about 6 months ago Anna started asking me to move in with her. While I wanted to live with her I was a little hesitant for multiple reasons. I lived with my parents rent free and I got along with them really well. Anna\u2019s apartment was small and kind of ugly and it made my commute 15 minutes longer to work. However I was eventually convinced when she said I didn\u2019t have to pay rent. She lived alone before and was paying rent anyway so I thought it made sense\n\nSo I moved in with her in November and things have seemed fine. It was an easier transition than I thought and I really thought it was a good decision for our relationship. Also, just to note-it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t contribute anything. I do most of the grocery shopping and cooking and I\u2019ve been gradually buying furniture and decorations to make the place nicer.\n\nA few days ago however Anna very suddenly asked me \u201chypothetically\u201d if she asked me to pay rent, if I would. I was a bit surprised. Anna has never brought it up before so I didn\u2019t know where it was coming from. Actually, I feel it may be coming from one of her close friends who does not like me for whatever reason but that\u2019s another story.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be a freeloader but like\u2026one of the reasons I agreed to move in with her was because she told me I didn\u2019t have to pay rent. Really there\u2019s nothing stopping me from moving back in with my parents (and taking all the stuff I bought with me). I explained that she told me I didn\u2019t have to pay rent and I would appreciate if she kept her word, but of course if it was a financial burden I could help a bit. After this conversation she dropped it but now she has me second guessing myself.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about finances together a few times. I know she makes decent money at her job and only has a little student loans left and no other debt. However I do make almost as much as she does and I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s getting resentful of me not contributing to the rent.

I\u2019m 26 years old. about 6 months ago Anna started asking me to move in with her. While I wanted to live with her I was a little hesitant for multiple reasons. I lived with my parents rent free and I got along with them really well. Anna\u2019s apartment was small and kind of ugly and it made my commute 15 minutes longer to work. However I was eventually convinced when she said I didn\u2019t have to pay rent. She lived alone before and was paying rent anyway so I thought it made sense\n\nSo I moved in with her in November and things have seemed fine. It was an easier transition than I thought and I really thought it was a good decision for our relationship. Also, just to note-it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t contribute anything. I do most of the grocery shopping and cooking and I\u2019ve been gradually buying furniture and decorations to make the place nicer.\n\nA few days ago however Anna very suddenly asked me \u201chypothetically\u201d if she asked me to pay rent, if I would. I was a bit surprised. Anna has never brought it up before so I didn\u2019t know where it was coming from. Actually, I feel it may be coming from one of her close friends who does not like me for whatever reason but that\u2019s another story.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be a freeloader but like\u2026one of the reasons I agreed to move in with her was because she told me I didn\u2019t have to pay rent. Really there\u2019s nothing stopping me from moving back in with my parents (and taking all the stuff I bought with me). I explained that she told me I didn\u2019t have to pay rent and I would appreciate if she kept her word, but of course if it was a financial burden I could help a bit. After this conversation she dropped it but now she has me second guessing myself.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about finances together a few times. I know she makes decent money at her job and only has a little student loans left and no other debt. However I do make almost as much as she does and I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s getting resentful of me not contributing to the rent.

Do you know how expensive a down payment is, if I didnt have to pay rent that would be fantastic for saving towards that. We don't know if he wasn't helping his family or not but we know he was with gf. He had no reason to move in with her until she said it would be the same deal as parents just with smaller place and longer commute so it's not as much a benefit to him. As far as we know him moving in with her is still a benefit to her even if he's not contributing half of rent. Being an adult also means making good financial decisions of the opportunities show up.
