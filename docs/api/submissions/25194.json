Rewarding people like this with the help you are only able to provide *precisely because you did not let them control you* is at best rewarding bad behavior, and can instead reinforce the behavior in them that caused the problem in the first place because the consequences of actions have been removed.

It's none of his business.\n\nYou're absolutely right to make a point of insisting your father ask for your help himself. But i don't why you want to give it, after the way he treated you.
