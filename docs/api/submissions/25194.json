You don't owe them anything, especially if they're not willing to ask.", "I don't even agree here because I just don't think OP should consider giving them money.

Your brother is. He has no idea what it was like to grow up unsupported, with your potential unrecognized and unvalued.

So he shouldn\u2019t be asking you to compromise, or judging when you refuse to. If you require that they recognize your success by asking for your help, that\u2019s your call. \n\nHe can talk to them about swallowing their pride instead of asking you to swallow yours. He can explain to them how much it would mean to you to be treated equally in this particular way instead of being treated as lesser. He can help them rise above the sexist culture they were raised in.\n\nYou could also choose to give voluntarily, recognizing their limitations and knowing that you\u2019re freer than they are to be your own person.

Let them stew in their shame until they repent.", "nta, dont you give them a fuckin red cent.", "NTA, you\u2019re not demanding anything from them other than that they communicate themselves as adults should.

They said they didn't think I would have had the money as I never finished college and wasn't in a high powered job like my brother. \n\nI told them I most definitely had the money, I had a great high paying job, even without college, but it was too late at that point to save the land which was worth several millions of dollars. \n\nMy parents always thought that education meant you would have knowledge or money. \n\nMy brother, the attorney didn't have the money or the knowledge he thought he did.", "NTA. just don't send them the money. you get what you give. they will survive! since they didn't seem to think you'd go to college and have a well paying career than can live as if you never did all of that.", "NTA I think you are incredibly generous for saying you would give them money. They definitely do not deserve that generosity. Saying they need to ask is nothing about shaming them, it is common courtesy.

Did they have money problems? Did they pay for the brother education? \n\nIt's obviously at the sister discretion to decide if she wants to give or not but imo she should really weight how good of parents they were overall and not just limit herself to this specific part of culture that she understandably hate.", "In his mind he\u2019s not accept woman\u2019s money\u2026 he is accepting his sons money and his son is taking dirty woman\u2019s money", "It just has to be filtered through clean man hands.", "That \"part of culture\" would have minimized her chances for a better life and harms society overall.  It's proven that the raising up of women in a country increases things like GDP and overall happiness, so while I get it that the brother *maybe* is empathetic but still chose to ask, she specifically said that her parents \"had no interest in my education or extracurricular activities\".  If her brother is that oblivious to something that **very obviously** is a strong red line for his sister, then yes, I'm going to jump to the conclusion that brother doesn't really consider the opinions and wants/needs of another woman, and likely didn't fall far from the tree."]}
