As you'd expect it's all she talks about. She's constantly telling stories, and showing pictures. Okay, it's pretty boring to me honestly, but I get it and I'm not gonna hold it against her.\n\nIt reached a problem point yesterday when she was going around to everyone in the break room (there were about 6 of us in there at the time) and basically fishing for us to say how handsome her son was. She would say something like \"oh my gosh he's so cute, how handsome do you think he'll be when he grows up.\" Again, I get that she's excited, but it's pretty obnoxious to self-aggrandize your own spawn like that.\n\nSo everyone cowtows to her obvious need to validate herself and says how cute her son is. Here's the problem though, this baby is OBJECTIVELY ugly. And I know I'm not the only one who thinks so.\n\nSo while everyone else is lying to make my coworker feel good, she gets to me and shows me the picture. I simple say \"oh nice\" hoping she'll move on. But of course she has to push it and asks \"how cute is he??\"\n\nHere's the thing, I haven't lied in over 3 years. I consider myself a very honest person and I can't condone lying even to preserve someone's feelings. So I told it like it is. In the most polite way I could think to say it, I replied \"he's not my cup of tea but I'm happy for you!\"\n\nThe room went silent. My coworker sat there for a second and then started telling me what a rude comment that was. She said to keep comments like that to myself. Everyone else in the room remained silent and a couple people snuck away.\n\nI argued back to my coworker that she shouldn't fish if she doesn't want to hear the truth. That pissed her off even more and she left the room. The couple coworkers that were left said that it was pretty tasteless for me to say what I said, but that they did agree with me that the baby was ugly.\n\nSo, AITA for my brutal honesty about the attractiveness of my co-workers baby?\n\nEdit: there seems to be some debate about the attractiveness of this baby. I want to put it to rest and say that there is no question that is baby is ugly. Must I remind you I'm the only one here who has actually seen it. \n\nI also want to point out that values aren't values of you pick and choose when you adhere to them.
