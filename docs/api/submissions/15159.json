If you insist, they'll be angry.  If you sneak and get caught, they'll be angry. Either way, it won't be a very good trip if everyone is angry and resentful, so I think you just shouldn't go.  Just tell them that you have decided that since they refuse to treat you as the adult you are, and that sharing with your bf is non-negotiable, you've decided to stay home rather than argue about it.  End of story.  Don't argue it further, just state that, and be done.  You and your boyfriend can go on your own vacation together.

Her parents are irrational but they are, I assume, bankrolling an entire vacation, and her choices are probably sleep separately on vacation or sleep together at home.", "Here's our option for dad this vacation, you get two rooms for us and the bf and I sneak around and have a ton of naughty illicit sex and sleep in the same bed anyway. You will find a room for us and we will all enjoy a nice vacation. Or the bf and I just stay home and spend the week having a ton of sex at my place. Your choice, nice vacation together or I stay at home. But I'll be at it all week regardless.", "There is no reason for them to be uncomfortable at this point because they have not paid for the house. Your father must understand your sexuality and relationship. Don't let him control you and thus ruin your relationship.", "She offered just that and still got yelled at", "Bad bot", "That doesn't mean the two of them can't sleep in separate rooms for a few nights. It won't kill either one of them to sleep separately to make their father more comfortable during a family vacation.", "Personally, I would just take a pass on the vacation \u201coh, no!! An obligation came up! What a shame that I can\u2019t join!!\u201d There are too many strings attached for my tastes", "So dont tell them you have your own room until you get there.", "Literally. My parents are like this too, and they\u2019d let OP and her bf share a room if they were married as well", "Vice versa, it won't kill her father for them to have one room. His comfort is not more important than OP and her boyfriend's.", "That\u2019s creepy, patriarchal and possessive on the father\u2019s part. His daughter is never allowed to be an adult who makes her own decisions about her body?", "Personally, I would just say to them \"I am not comfortable with your rules, and with the gift coming with strings attached\". Sometimes it pays off in the long run to let them just hear it.", "Yeah exactly - thanks but no thanks", "Take a pass then go on a staycation at a hotel with the boyfriend out of spite haha.", "My option was just setting a clear boundary and communicating it like an adult. But I'm petty as F*$& so I choose your option.", "I am also quite petty.", "NAH.", "NTA.\nEither book your own room or don't go, your both adults on vacation.\n\nA few years into dating my ex we (mid-late 20s) made the long trip to visit/spend the holidays with her family.\nThey made me not only sleep in a different room, the room wasn't even attached to the house, it was above the garage.\nIt was snowing, the stairs were covered in ice/snow, I didn't sleep properly that entire visit.\n\nNot my house, not my rules but boy was it kinda weird to be in a completely different building. \nI also didn't find out they were *extremely* religious until years later.", "NTA   \nIn my opinion though: Keep the peace. Book 2 rooms. Stay with your boyfriend anyway.   \n\n\nIs this a religious thing? If your parents think that this room arrangement is necessary for your soul to enter heaven you have to either fight/explain/attempt to reason or just let them think that they single-handedly ensured your heaven ticket. Your choice.   \nIs this just your dad unable to imagine you sleeping with a man. Then, in my opinion, still keep the peace. And at some point seat your dad now and explain calmly that you are an adult now and adults tend to have active sexual lives.", "NTA - and my parents would be wasting money, 'cuz only one room would be getting used. At 21 why are you allowing your parents to control your life might something to look into.", "NTA. in future if your parents ever come to stay with you, I\u2019d be petty as fuck and not allow them to share a room because I\u2019m \u201cjust not comfortable with it\u201d\u2026", "NTA but honestly just let this one go. Let them get the separate hotel rooms and then you just sleep where you want. Your dad will likely not be camped out in the hallway so you can easily sleep wherever and they probably won\u2019t even notice unless you\u2019re SUPER obvious about it.", "NTA\n\nHave you just told your dad that regardless of the existence of a 3rd room, his adult daughter is still going to choose to sleep in the same room with her adult partner?", "INFO\n\nWhy can't you let them buy a separate room and simply not use it? Are your parents going to come drag you out if you choose to stay in your boyfriend's room instead?", "NTA - but just respect their wishes this one time. It won\u2019t harm you and honestly nobody says you have to use your room at night.", "NTA Do they not realize that even if they pay for two rooms, you and your BF are going to end up in one?", "NTA, what do your parents think you're still 16? They need to grow up and understand you're an adult you're 21, you can make choices for yourself.", "NTA but parents can be like this sometimes, my fiance's parents are religious and made us sleep in separate rooms until we moved in together (while dating still, not engaged) and they finally dropped it. But there wasn't a single night we actually spent apart, I spent every night in his room and just kept my stuff in the spare room with the door shut. They probably knew tbh, but I think it just made them feel more comfortable to pretend otherwise so we went along with the charade.\n\nI'm guessing you can probably spend every night together still but I get it's a bit of an annoying hassle especially if everyone lowkey knows you're still spending the night together which was the case in my situation", "NTA\u2026is dad paying for the extra room?  Then let him pay for it.  No one says you have to sleep in it.  What one does not know will not hurt them.  Or tell them thank you, but if you cannot share a room you will not be going on said family trip.", "nta, he shouldn't be this concerned with your xes life", "NTA. Stand your ground, ask your dad \u201cat what point will you be comfortable with us staying in the same room on a family vacation\u201d and then tell your dad no thank you to your room and your boyfriends room and buy your own.", "NTA\n\nAs many others have already suggested; You should sit your parents down and explain to them that you are an adult in a long term relationship another adult. It is wasteful to pay 3 rooms in this situation, if they don't feel comfortable paying for you two to share a room then you and your boyfriend will pay for their own. If this is a deal breaker for your parents then it's for the best you stay home instead as you are not going to allow them to control your life in such a manner.", "NAH. You both are living what you want. If you cannot sleep separately and that's more important than the family vacation, then live your values and don't go. If you are able to sleep on your own, then go.", "Nta. Wtf?", "Idk Orr you could just sleep in the same room without them seeing and let them pay for 2 if it makes them more comfortable", "NTA\n\nOddly enough, though I do understand their discomfort with the idea, being a dinosaur from a prudish background myself, I have managed to move with the times.  So I would prefer for my daughter to share a room with a nice boyfriend with whom she\u2019s in a healthy relationship, than stay alone.  It\u2019s always risky for women to travel alone, unfortunately.", "NTA. Your a grown damn adult. In a grown up relationship. Your parents are being total AHs. I'd refuse to go entirely and just save up for your own vacation.", "NTA. If your dad is adamant on paying for separate rooms and won't take the opportunity to save some money, let him. That isn't gonna stop you, an adult, and your boyfriend, an adult, from sleeping with each other \ud83d\ude02\n\nWhat's he gonna do? Keep a guard by your hotel rooms 24/7?", "NTA \u201cBoyfriend and I will be booking our own room we appreciate the offer of paying but we\u2019d be more comfortable being in charge our own accommodation as a couple\u201d.\n\nIf he continues throwing a fit, don\u2019t go.  This is about control plain and simple.", "NAH. \n\nYour dad is allowed to have whatever weird boundaries he likes. \n\nHowever, you don\u2019t have to go on the trip with them.", "NTA.   Just don't go on the trip.", "NTA. It's not your job to cater to their discomfort. Make it very clear you will not allow them to disrespect you or control your body. Be as explicit as you want in telling them you have sex regularly. Ball is in their court. They can have a family vacation or they can be puritans. They can't have both.", "NTA. Youre an adult and this is ridiculous.", "I wouldn\u2019t even sneak", "I was in college. It was batshit. Emotionally immature parents who focus on control without purpose are so difficult", "I bet her dad owns a shotgun.", "Nta \nThis is basically a you need to have an adult conversation with them \n\nTell them you get they are uncomfortable with paying for it, you'll pay for it and book it, but the reality is you guys are having sex and do sleep at each other's apartments and are adults. Be respectful,  don't try to rile them up, but dancing around it a bit and saying you want to share a room won't help. Everyone, including him, knows why he's uncomfortable with it... so just talk about it.... or take the 2 rooms and you and him bounce back and forth between them", "I'd go a different route: acting genuinely confused. \n\nTalk to the parents and ask why they feel that way, pretending to not understand any innuendo. Pretend to be genuinely concerned. Make them spell it out in as clear and simple language as possible.\n\nBecause, when they do that, it'll be painful and awkward for them and make them feel really dumb.", "I would loooove to have my own bedroom when traveling with the in-laws.", "I\u2019m sure they can go those nights without sleeping together but it\u2019s the bigger point they are fighting against. She is a 21 year old financially independent woman. Personally I would decline to go because at that age usually you are establishing with your parents that they no longer set the rules for you. That you set the rules for you. Their control does not extend into adulthood and many many parents struggle with that transition.", "Why the dislikes? She can choose as well not to go, wtf some ppl of you have issues here", "Well then they can just not go", "This is a karma farming bot. This comment was stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rjo8j/aita_for_getting_upset_at_my_parents_for_not/jgvitnq?context=3)", "'But it makes me uncomfortable that you will share a room together'. Sounds stupid but their stance is stupid too so.", "I dunno, maybe I'm just spoiled for being able to sleep with who I want the rest of the year, but I would 100% take a paid vacation with the only rule being, \"You get your own hotel room for the entire trip and can't share with anyone.\"  That's fucking awesome.  I get being annoyed by having unwanted, irrational restrictions placed on yourself but seriously, free vacation and the *downside* is a private room?  Fuck yes.", "I would go along with the father's rules because I could handle a couple nights without sleeping next to my bf.  Free vacation!\n\nDad just has a complex about his little girl growing up and maybe it's weird but it's just not a hill I'd die on , personally.", "And send your Dad a pic of the great book you got for your stay....the Kama Sutra...that should REALLY ruin his vacation lol."]}
