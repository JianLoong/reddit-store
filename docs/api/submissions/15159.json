Maybe that will help your dad see the ridiculousness. On the other hand, if you are considering this long-term relationship to have a future, it might be good to take his (old) feelings into account and show respect to them even if he isn't showing respect to you.", "If it were me I\u2019d go on a different trip.

In which universe does a 21 year old IN A RELATIONSHIP, not have sex (and probably tons of it)?\n\nThe best thing to do is to shock them into reality. Try this:\n\n\"Mom, dad, I'm an adult and I have a long term boyfriend, whom you have met and approve. And guess what?? \n\nWE HAVE SEX!! \n\nWe enjoy to ravage each others bodies all the time, as any healthy young people would do in our age.\n\nSURPRISED?? Of a natural occurance between two people in love??\n\nWell, tough shit, it isn't the dark ages any more...\n\nPreventing us from staying in a hotel room together, will only lead us to NOT coming with you. And go to our own home, which we have as adults, have sex again, and talk shit about your childish behaviour.\"\n\nThat will definitely knock some perspective into them.", "NTA for asking and expressing what you want.\n\nIf you and your boyfriend want to go, then pay for the trip yourselves and get your own room. \n\nYou do not mention if your parents are religious or not.  So hard to say if there is a problem from a religious point of view or your parents are burying their heads in the sand and want to pretend that you are still a virgin. Although you might be... I do not know.\n\nOne of the other commentators pointed out three options.  All of which are good.  \n\nI think you need to ponder that your parents are paying for the trip so wrongfully or rightfully so, they have more say.  In their defense, they did invite your boyfriend, so they are not totally clueless and showing some respect for your relationship.\n\nLastly, we all have to do things for our parents/families that we would rather not do.  You are an adult, technically, but I assume they are paying for part or wholly for your university education.  Again, with the money comes some power, rightfully or wrongfully so. \n\nIf you are paying for everything yourself (university education, housing and food), then I would mention that to them.  I am on my own making my own decisions and this is something that is important to me.  See what they say then.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA, you offered to pay your room so you can share it with him.

Your parents may know you and your boyfriend spend the night together at school, but you\u2019re away at school and they can not think about it. If you\u2019re right there in front of them going into the room together and coming out together, it\u2018s harder for them to ignore. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re right. I\u2019m just telling you what\u2019s going on with them. I have a kid your age. I will tell you that for many parents, thinking about your kid having sex can be weird and discomfiting, plus fathers get weird about daughters (yes, it\u2019s sexist), but honestly, unless they were virgins when they got married and genuinely subscribe to some fire and brimstone YOU WILL GO TO HELL IF YOU HAVE PREMARITAL SEX!! nonsense, they can just get a grip.\n\nYou have 3 choices:\n\n1. Put your foot down, point out that you spend nights together at school and their choice is the two of you share a room or you\u2019re not going.\n2. Accept the 2 room plan and then, very carefully and discreetly, get in as much couple privacy time as you can without them finding out. This sort of thing is a time-honored approach.\n3.

Your bf wants to have a good relationship with maybe future in-laws, so why not indulge in this silliness?", "Your parents are paying so they get to set that rule, regardless of whether it is silly or not. Pay for your own room or decline to go on the trip.", "NAH.\n\nYour parents want to pay for another room, let them. It doesn\u2019t mean that you have to use it. It may be wasteful, but if it lets your parents feel more comfortable, then let them. And that way if you and BF have a fight, or just need some space, there\u2019ll be a separate space available.", "You have to suck it up if you want to go to the trip. It's just a night or some nights, have patience, there are many more nights awaiting you with your bf.", "Regardless of whether you think it makes sense for you and your 21yo bf to share a hotel room on a family trip with your parents, you need to understand that part of parenting is protecting your children by setting boundaries.  This is a boundary your father has every right to set, and if you respect your parents and want them to respect you, you should honor it.  \n\nPlus, they\u2019re your parents, and the thought of their 21 y/o daughter sleeping with her bf in the room right next to them is probably super uncomfortable for them.  \n\nSoft YWBTA.
