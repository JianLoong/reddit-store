{"id": 33334, "submission_id": "18lyvea", "title": "AITA for buying baby related gifts to gift my pregnant girlfriend for Christmas?", "selftext": "So my (25M) partner (24F) is 7 months pregnant, with our baby boy due in March next year. \n\nNow I'm admittedly bad at thinking of what gifts to get people, so I always take a note of when they say they want something so that I have a list. In the past several months though, almost everything that she's mentioned has been related to the baby. I'm not talking the essentials, but really high end, expensive designer strollers, furniture, diaper bags etc that can cost up to a few thousand dollars each that aren't really necessary. She's been absolutely fixated on some of these things, mentioning multiple times how much she wanted them, and was even toying with the idea of saving up to buy them herslef (I'm not sure if she did decide to or not).\n\nNow I got a really healthy bonus at work recently, so decided to splurge on a few of the things she mentioned as a christmas gift to her. I made sure to remove anything related off her registry and off our list of things we still needed to buy, so that no one else would buy it. I thought I did it discreetly, but she somehow noticed and quizzed me about it. I didn't feel like there was any point hiding it, so I told her I had bought those things as a Christmas gift to her. I thought she'd be grateful, but she was irritated instead, and went on a bit of rant about how it was unfair to count things for the baby as a christmas gift to her, because it was something we'd both use, and no one ever gifts the father baby stuff. And that it was inconsiderate of me to see her as only a mother now and not a person herself. \n\nNow I get her point, but the way I see it is that the items themselves aren't necessarily the gift, but more so the act of me buying them for her, given they are luxuries that she specifically wanted and were not necessities at all (e.g. paying $2000 for a pram vs $200). Also, it wasn't the only gift's I bought her. I got her about a dozen smaller, cheaper things that were on my list, as well as a more expensive tennis bracelet + earring set that she had been eyeing, though I didn't mention that to her. \n\nSo AITA for including things for the baby as part of her Christmas gifts?", "created_utc": 1702981935, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lyvea/aita_for_buying_baby_related_gifts_to_gift_my/", "score": 418, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And given them at the shower vs using them as Christmas. Especially since you bought the jewelry set she was wanting as her Christmas gift.  Same outcome different intention.", "YTA. Yea, baby gifts aren't a gift for her, she's right. But I'd actually say Y T A because instead of listening to what she's saying, you're here trying to justify it. She's telling you she doesn't want to just be a mother, she wants to be a person too - pregnancy can be really rough on women in terms of identity. Acknowledge her point & reassure her that you have got her a present for her.", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s absolutely right - these are things for the baby, not her. You will both use them to care for your child.\n\nBy making them gifts for her, you\u2019ve effectively assigned the baby to her. It\u2019s hers, her responsibility, and here\u2019s the stuff to go with it. Not cool.\n\nIf you want to buy things in preparation for the baby, do so. That\u2019s great. Don\u2019t wrap them and put them under the tree for your partner.", "On reading the title I thought YTA as a gift for the baby is definitely not a gift for the pregnant mum. However, as she wants all really high end stuff, I think you should have just had a conversation with her. As in saying, \u2018 we have a budget of $75 for a diaper bag. If you want a designer bag, it will need to be part of your Christmas present, as I can\u2019t afford to pay $800 for that plus expensive Christmas gifts. Then she could have decided if that means more to her than something on her Xmas list.  \nSo I am going with ESH.\n\nInfo: Does she work? Is she expecting you to buy all of the high end baby gear unless she \u2018saves for it\u2019? \n\nOh and you can get loads of midrange baby stuff that is gorgeous and long lasting. It doesn\u2019t have to be cheap vs eye wateringly expensive.", "YTA. Soft but still.\n\nShe is right: the gifts/luxuries are not for her per se. You could ignore her wish for a $2,000 pram (actually spending 2,000 on a pram makes you a bigger a-hole).\n\nHer Christmas gifts should be about her, like a spa day for pregnant ladies or that bracelet you mentioned. The moment anything baby-related goes under mom\u2019s pile, pregnant mommies-to-be and new mommies tend to feel hurt, disrespected, disregarded.\n\nDon\u2019t try to understand it with 1+1 logic, it\u2019s just what it is. (Also don\u2019t you dare buy anything baby-related for her bday!!! There will be war.)", "Eh everyone is different I guess but as a pregnant girlfriend, I would absolutely say YTA. Some women love making their identity around motherhood. Personally I feel forgotten about as a person when I'm growing one and wouldn't want this unless it had been discussed beforehand.", "YTA. Those gifts aren't for her,they are for the baby!  Not only that, but she can't actually use any of it until March.\n\nNothing says I love you more than I've bought you a Christmas present that isn't actually for you,it's for our child and you can't use it for another three months \ud83d\ude09", "YTA...you bought baby gear for HER as a Christmas gift?  No, you bought those things for BOTH of you because you are BOTH parents. As a dad, I encourage you consider child rearing a project to be shared equally.  That means changing diapers, cleaning up puked on/crapped on baby, feeding, bathing, getting up during the night, etc without being asked.  Most importantly, make sure she has a chance to spend some time AWAY from the baby when she needs to.  Finally, for goodness sake, buy her some gifts that are actually just for her.", "I think I can give some insight to this. When I got pregnant, I was (still am) a full time career woman, managing my own team and doing the things I wanted. All of a sudden, when my belly started to show, random people and people I know would start calling me \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cmummy\u201d. My bosses would tried to get me to go easy at work and refused to let me join a conference out of town because I was pregnant. Of course, he was well meaning but that upset me. \n\nStrangers would treat me like a fragile person. Add to that, you feel yourself physically getting more tired, slower, less able. I\u2019m not going to lie, but I felt I was losing my identity. I felt that I morphed into a mother, with no identity of my own. Hormones also played a lot into that. \n\nI think your wife, excited as she is for the baby, may feel similar to what I felt. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was excited for my baby and being a mom is one of the most rewarding things ever and I wouldn\u2019t change anything. But I did feel like I was losing myself for a bit.", "Damn, I feel like most people are way too harsh to OP and maybe didn't even read the whole post. \n\nIt's very clearly NAH for me. \n\nHow OP describes it: \nHe brought luxus baby stuff for Christmas because he thought his gf would appreciate it. He also brought her a dozen other non-baby related presents. \n\nWhat his gf hears: \nOP ONLY brought baby related stuff, therefore showing that he only sees her as a mother now.\n\nWhat I see: \nOP brought his gf a dozen presents. All things he knows she'll appreciate. \nBut because OP got a huge bonus at work, he decided to spoil his gf even more and brought a lot of unnecessary but nice luxurious baby items that his gf loves so much. \n\nThe only reason the gf is pissed rn is because she doesn't know OP didn't just buy baby products for her. \n\nOP, I guess you didn't tell her because you wanted to keep the suprise but this whole fight of yours could have been prevented if you had just told her that the baby stuff are just extra presents she's getting because of your promotion. \n\nNAH", "Pay notice to what she said   And remember going forward. She is \u2026\u2026\u2026, not just your baby mama \n\nDon\u2019t make her gifts for someone else (your future kids), or she will loose who she is you still seeing her as the person you love will help in the future \n\nSoft yta", "YTA although I get where you are coming from. To you those are luxury item you wouldn\u2019t normally buy because of the price (and I agree with you here!). So I get your logic that as a gift you could justify it. However, for her they are essentially baby items and an expense for both of you for the baby, not a present. A stroller is a necessity not a bonus for her to have. Imagine you set your eye on a bottle that is easier to clean for a nighttime feeding - I guess you wouldn\u2019t appreciate that as a birthday present either because for you it\u2019s a necessity for the baby. \n\nInstead you should talk to her about the budget and why you shouldn\u2019t buy overpriced stuff. Or to rectify the situation at hand: tell her that it\u2019s actually from the work bonus and you wanted to surprise her but also get her non baby stuff for Christmas, this was just an stupid way to surprise her.", "NTA for buying the pram, YTA for saying it\u2019s a gift for her. She\u2019s right, it\u2019s for both of you. And she\u2019s also right that if you give her the pram as a Christmas gift, it\u2019s like saying she is now just a mother and nothing else. I\u2019m assuming she doesn\u2019t know the other things you got her. \n\nYou can reframe this as the baby stuff is a Christmas gift for the *both* of you.", "I\u2019m firmly NTA on this actually.  There\u2019s wanting and needing things for the baby, and there\u2019s wanting what is perceived as the top of the line for your ego.  Not that she should have to get by without little luxuries if you all can afford them.  But if you\u2019ve not been on the page about a $2000 crib and you finally say \u201cwell if she really wants it I\u2019ll splurge on it for the holidays\u201d I don\u2019t see the problem with that. \n\nPLUS you got her other gifts.  She\u2019s kind of spoiling her own Christmas. It honestly sounds like you spent 10k+ on her presents, which is crazy.  What gives her the idea that you didn\u2019t buy her anything else at all?", "As someone who owns a $1500 stroller, I can tell you with pure confidence this is a want, not a NEED. A $200 stroller works just as well. NTA. She wanted to go above and beyond, she can accept this as one of her gifts.", "NTA. The functional part is that it moves the baby around = $200 according to you. The \"gift\" part is the extra $1800 of fancy designer-ness so SHE can parade it around and feel fancy (both you and the baby don't give a shit about this part). That's 10% function that you'll both use and 90% fancyness just for her.  \n\nThat being said, this is about feelings and not about reason but she does sound a teensy bit ungrateful. She shouldn't be angry with you as this was done with good intentions but she is absolutely right to explain how it made her feel. \n\nI guess you want the other gifts to be a surprise but it may have helped to tell her there are non-baby gifts and the baby gifts were extra bonuses. \n\nPetty option: buy a really cheap pram and use it when you take the baby out so you are not using \"her\" gift.", "YTA - she is right, these are things for the baby, that everyone will use, so they\u2019re not for her. \n\nBut I do see your reasoning, as these are expensive, luxury baby items. \n\nIt would of been better to have spoken to her and both of you decided what could be a luxury baby item and what could be a basic version.\n\nThen also! you could have asked her what she would like for Xmas! As she seems to be a person who knows what she wants! There\u2019s no harm in asking.", "YTA. You didn't buy your girlfriend any gifts, you bought presents for the baby.", "YWBTA if it was only baby stuff because it's right she might wish for those luxury items for the baby but not for herself for christmas. As you just didn't tell her that there is more for her personally you are NTA. But she will think so until christmas and shes pregnant so you will have to deal with it for a few more days.", "YTA. Those are for the baby. But what about Mom to be? What, all her gifts from now on gonna be for the kids but nothing for herself at all?", "NTA. I can't even imagine wanting, banging on and on about thousands of dollars of items which are WELL above the necessary costs and then expect you to buy it, but not as a Christmas gift. Like yes, if this was a few baby rattles, or baby wipes, or necessities, she absolutely has a point. But we are talking high end, over the top wants. They are gifts.\nGosh, if I want anything which is over the top, I'm happy to have it as a gift, even if it's not necessarily just for me. \nYour girlfriend sounds entitled af.", "YTA. \nHere's a tip. A gift is something she and she alone would use. So if it's for the house or other family members use, it doesn't count as a gift for HER. \nAnother tip: (my birthday is really special to me so Hubby came up with a cool idea) a gift box. He gets a box at the beginning of the year and then adds to it throughout the year. He adds things I might like but won't necessarily buy for myself. Small teddy bears, bath things, cool pens, watches(you get the idea).\n\nAnother tip: ask her to make a top 5 list. It will give you an idea of what she would like so that you don't feel completely clueless.", "No one, absolutely no one needs a 2000\u20ac pram. Getting it anyway for Christmas plus a billion other gifts and still be grumpy, my god. Good luck with that OP.", "YTA the items were for the baby, not for her. It is like buying your mum a vacuum so she can clean up after you, or a pot so she can cook for you. No. You can buy those things. It can be a lovely gesture, just not as a Christmas, Birthday, Anniversary (etc.) gift.\n\nYou mentioned they were on the baby registry, not a personal gift wish list. A great idea would have been to surprise her with a specific amount of money that you could both (or she) could buy things for the baby. Just not for Christmas.", "YTA. You don't buy baby items as Christmas (or birthday or anniversary etc) gifts.", "It a very soft YTA, having just had my baby I would be upset if my husband did what you did, but we weren\u2019t looking high end we looking for a pram and other items that were save did what we needed without breaking the bank, a discussion with her should it happen about the baby items, if she had saved maybe you could of split the cost. \nIt nice you got other stuff for her, I would apologise and say I do have other stuff for you too, make sure she know you had the other gifts already - she will need you to remind her who she is and that she not just mum when baby here", "\u201c You bought me a vacuum for my Christmas present?\u201d Yeah, but it\u2019s a Dyson! You\u2019re sweet but her life is going to be swallowed up and her identity changed to being a mom, she needs gifts for her.  Great job on buying the baby early birthday presents though. Yta", "Yes, absolutely YTA.", "Soft YTA. I understand your reasoning and think maybe some women wouldn't have minded. Plus the fact that you bought other gifts as well kind of makes it better. But when she said she was unhappy with this you should have been more understanding and tried to maybe return those items. Many people simply do not want practical gifts because for them gifts aren't about saving money by making somebody else pay for something that you need anyway - they're about someone thinking of and buying something you might want but didn't know you want or wouldn't buy yoursepf because you don't need it. Your wife seems to be one of those people and I think you should respect that.", "YTA. You should have at least bought her a Christmas gift \\*just for her\\*. \n\nAnd discuss the budget for the necessary baby items. Of course, if you spend (your example) 1800 dollars more on a pram, the money has to come from somewhere. You're both adults, you should be able to discuss those things.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a pretty common issue for new mothers to only get baby stuff as gifts for a while, and it\u2019s awful. Everyone seems to forget that you\u2019re still a person and treat you as a mother. \n\nThink of it this way, would you be happy if she gave you these gifts and nothing big that\u2019s actually just for you? You\u2019re just as much as the parent as she is.", "YTA.\n\nLike she said, things for the baby are not a Christmas present for the mother.\n\nCouldn't you give them back and re-enter them in the baby list?", "Sigh.  She is more than a mother you know.   Yes you BOTH need things for taking care of YOUR child.  If you wanted to pay $2000 for a pram which is a ridiculous price) then why try and pretend it is a christmas gift for your girlfriend.   Figure this out now.    Your girlfriend is your girlfriend and deserves to be treated as your girlfriend.   the mother of your baby is the mother of your baby, you know, that human being you are 50% responsible for taking care of and raising?   Don\u2019t merge the two.    Items for a baby are not \u201cgifts\u201d for your girlfriend.   They are items for the baby.", "YTA If it was just one baby related thing like a really nice designer changing bag then that would have been fine. Making most of her presents baby related is not fine. Every first time mum is going to want the best / most expensive stroller etc. that's an expectation that needs to be managed and doesn't mean they don't want their own Christmas presents.", "YTA", "YTA - but softly . Mother\u2019s often get gifts related to their baby and it makes it seem like you forgot she\u2019s an individual before a mother. Also you\u2019re going to be using these items too and a lot so than the gift becomes less about her and more about everyone. It\u2019s like dishes, a vacuum ,ect it\u2019s not specifically for the individual. And you\u2019ll be using most of the babies stuff daily so quality doesn\u2019t matter.", "NTA! What a bunch of selfish twats on this thread. I would have LOVED getting expensive baby stuff I wanted, even for my own bday (and OP says he got her a bunch of other trinkets, amyway). \nThese are items it sounds like she wanted badly, and as far as I know, OP didn\u2019t mention any specific baby stuff he really wanted, otherwise I would also assume it\u2019s fair to get him stuff like that for his own birthday. \nNTA NTA NTA. Sorry you\u2019re partner\u2019s being a brat.", "NAH really because she doesn\u2019t know yet she\u2019s getting anything but baby stuff.", "NTA.

But you made her feel like an incubator.", "NTA\n\nAll the comments so far seem to be missing the part where you've also bought a bunch of smaller more personal gifts for her, like the tennis bracelet.

Instead of \"I bought these things as a Christmas gift for you\" it should have been \"I used part of my bonus to get get a bunch of the baby stuff I know you wanted us to get. I wanted it to be a surprise at Christmas for us as a family\".\n\nOr something to that effect... My point being, you need to use language that makes it clear that you understand that this stuff is for all of you as a family.\n\nAlso...

Im sorry but 2000dollars or euro in my country (NL) is a lot of money for most people. What she wanted were things that weren't necessary in that price range. You got get very good baby items half that price and even better 2nd hand.. and christmas shouldn't be about the expensive gifts, but the time spend together.\nMy bf and I agreed on no gift giving, unless it's something you think would really make the other person happy, otherwise we just make a trip somewhere as our shared gift and no fighting happens afterwards! \nOf course I can see a bit of her point and I would have gotten 1 or 2 nice things like that bracelet, but I find her and most people here very easily thinking about the money. I would be over the moon if my partner gotten me those luxury baby items for xmas! What I see here, Im sorry is no more than 1st world problems and very spoiled attitudes and little gratitude. \ud83d\ude05", "NAH-but this is either a fake post or she\u2019s a spoiled brat. There are many things that point to this. 1. She noticed the items are missing and \u201cbrought it up to discuss\u201d. No one should bring it up when the holidays are coming up. 2. She doesn\u2019t actually know all the things you got for her. Her assuming that all her gifts are baby things is just that-an assumption. Buy her a spa day card and a cute sparkly wristlet (or jewelry) to put IN the over the top diaper bag and you make that assumption not true. 3. As high end as these things are, they do become gifts for her. There are plenty of these that would be truly for the baby that wouldn\u2019t cost this much. Those less expensive items would be a no-no as gifts for her, so technically the sentiment of what she\u2019s saying is correct, but the high end nature of this situation makes that null and void.\n\nI hope for the child\u2019s sake this relationship lasts more than a few months. You both seem a little childish & a little irresponsible to me. Unless you\u2019re a millionaire, I think it\u2019s really unwise to be spending thousands on these things that will only get used for 1-3 years, and I\u2019m pretty comfortable in saying that she will likely want new things for a future baby. \n\nI\u2019m a woman & mother. I mention it because I think it\u2019s relevant to my opinion on the situation.", "Sorry, but YTA. She is right.", "YTA she isn\u2019t just pregnant she\u2019s a person who still deserves personal gifts not just things that your baby will need", "YTA. \n\nGo and get her a nice necklace, a perfume or something like that.

Your hobbies get left on the sidelines. \n\nIts nice that you bought the pricey stuff for baby. But you should have discussed it with your partner.

It's not like you're getting her a bottle steriliser or a nappy bin, we're talking about a nice nappy bag and an expensive pram, which let's be honest, she probably just wants because of the brand, not because it's better than a more affordable model. So it's all about what she wants, not needs, therefore perfectly acceptable gifts imo. On top of that you got her jewellery too, but it probably would have been good if you told her that too since you already told her the other part of her presents. So I dont think you're an AH for the gifts, but because of your lack of communication and understanding of her feelings.

In the past several months though, almost everything that she's mentioned has been related to the baby. I'm not talking the essentials, but really high end, expensive designer strollers, furniture, diaper bags etc that can cost up to a few thousand dollars each that aren't really necessary. She's been absolutely fixated on some of these things, mentioning multiple times how much she wanted them, and was even toying with the idea of saving up to buy them herslef (I'm not sure if she did decide to or not).\n\nNow I got a really healthy bonus at work recently, so decided to splurge on a few of the things she mentioned as a christmas gift to her. I made sure to remove anything related off her registry and off our list of things we still needed to buy, so that no one else would buy it. I thought I did it discreetly, but she somehow noticed and quizzed me about it. I didn't feel like there was any point hiding it, so I told her I had bought those things as a Christmas gift to her. I thought she'd be grateful, but she was irritated instead, and went on a bit of rant about how it was unfair to count things for the baby as a christmas gift to her, because it was something we'd both use, and no one ever gifts the father baby stuff. And that it was inconsiderate of me to see her as only a mother now and not a person herself. \n\nNow I get her point, but the way I see it is that the items themselves aren't necessarily the gift, but more so the act of me buying them for her, given they are luxuries that she specifically wanted and were not necessities at all (e.g. paying $2000 for a pram vs $200). Also, it wasn't the only gift's I bought her. I got her about a dozen smaller, cheaper things that were on my list, as well as a more expensive tennis bracelet + earring set that she had been eyeing, though I didn't mention that to her. \n\nSo AITA for including things for the baby as part of her Christmas gifts?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Loss of self-identity is a thing for new parents and maybe dad-2-be hasn't reached that yet, but 7 month-along momma has.", "I agree. If he had bought those things specifically because he thought they'd be great for the baby and gift it to her so that he doesn't have to buy his gf a present that is one thing. However he bought those things specifically because his gf wanted them and not because they're necessities for the baby or because he didn't want to think about a present for her. \n\nI go with NAH as I can see both points.", "Babies are ultra messy. Lol, I hope the high-end stroller wipes down well. Maybe it will become a heirloom stroller for baby 2, 3, etc?", "Totally disagree- I own 4 strollers (2 expensive and 2 cheap) the difference is huge and the most expensive clearly outperforms the others on all terrains. \n\nNote - didn\u2019t intend to own 4, we have well meaning grandparents who live far away so have their own at their houses.", "Yes, but he will also benefit from the convenience of the higher quality stroller.", "But I also see how suddenly you're worried that your whole identity is changing that you're now a mother. You still want gifts for yourself. I would have maybe bought a stroller but then giving it at the shower.", "The difference is comfort - ease of pushing - what sort of terrain you can cover, weight, sturdiness and then design. The cheap one does the job but the expensive one does the job well. Similar to the difference between cheap and expensive running shoes.", "And for the dad. She\u2019s not going to be the only one pushing the baby around in it. Just because it\u2019s high end doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s the only one that\u2019s going to benefit from it. This should have been more of a gift to the family and then he gets something more personal for her specifically. He already said he got her jewelry though so he could save this by saying he was just trying to throw her attention off the real gift so it\u2019s a surprise.", "Yeah. She's over the top image conscious.\nShe's also materialistic. Both of which are forms of narcissistic behavior.", "But she doesn't know that. She just knows she is getting baby stuff for Christmas", "Exactly. For nine months, mom is an actual person people care about, ask how she's doing, feeling, needing, etc. Then out pops baby and suddenly no one gives a crap about mom any more. It's jarring and disconcerting.   \nOP, please apologize to her.", "Oh that\u2019s a much better idea!", "That's a cute idea. Maybe wrap them in ambiguous packaging so neither parent knows what is what, and both open the presents together.", "That\u2019s what happened to me I got my own gift for Christmas this year and I was shook", "Sounds like he is a registrant as well and he just removed them. However, I still would have noticed if my husband did that. I was checking my registry like every day when people were actively purchasing things lol", "I just watched a video today where the guy thought they had an extra stocking hanging out but it was his wife\u2019s that was empty. And then he asked her about it like a dope and she looked so sad.", "Why what I\u2019d she fills her own stocking ? will christmas be ruined ? Is that the meaning ? Stocking fillers.", "I have a designer diaper bag, but also a backpack. My husband uses the backpack, but I started using the backpack because it\u2019s easier to carry while also carrying an infant/toddler. My husband would only use the designer bag if the backpack wasn\u2019t available because designer diaper bags are literally big purses. \n\nIt\u2019s in the original post that this was one of the things on her list. He got several expensive and/or designer things PLUS other gifts that are exclusively for her on top of the thousands of dollars in stuff she wants. Maybe he could have given them not for Xmas or wrapped them up and said they\u2019re for the baby.", "Exactly! Putting things on a registry is meant for the baby shower with a \u201cthis would be cool but I\u2019m not expecting it\u201d vibe. If someone gets it for the baby shower great or if hubby wants to get it for the baby out of his bonus that\u2019s fine too but it is still for the baby. Once the baby is too big for the stroller it\u2019s not like the mom is going to just walk around pushing her purse in it because it\u2019s designer.", "Presents should be about making people happy. If you get your wife something expensive that they have  really wanted for months, it should be appreciated  - baby related or not.\n\nAnd its not like ALL presents were baby related.", "Voice of reason!!", "\u201cNo one ever gifts the father baby stuff\u201d That is literally true. Not manipulation. It\u2019s pretty common for women to start receiving gifts exclusively for their children after becoming mothers, while their husbands still get video games and golf clubs and what not. Women lose their identity as an individual and men are still allowed to have personal interests.", "As someone who owns a $1500 pram, I can promise you that NO, you do NOT need it more than a $200 stroller.", "Well maybe she shouldn\u2019t get upset about what she thinks she\u2019s going to get or not get BEFORE Christmas has even happened. Talk about entitled. Getting mad about what you THINK you got before Christmas even happens?", "Yeah she doesn\u2019t know about the other stuff because CHRISTMAS HAS NOT HAPPENED YET. She\u2019s getting mad about her Christmas presents when it hasn\u2019t even happened. ENTITLED!", "Good thing she\u2019ll have other presents then!", "Lots of men enjoy DIY work and would be happy with specific tools for their hobby as a gift, the same goes with suits which can be quite costly.\n\nThere's obvious difference in buying your husband something he enjoys or being passive aggressive and giving him power tools to pressure him into work you want him to do. \n\nYou won't need power tools in your daily life and there's no reason to buy them, you could just rent. You just need a small tool kit to have at hand and I wouldn't consider that as a present, only if the recipient specifically asked for it. \n\nOn the other hand appliances such as vacuum, oven, fridge are commonly used by all the people living in the household and are necessary. Giving those to a one person specifically as a gift is quite offensive unless there's a good reason for it.", "That is completely different. Some men actually like ties. And doing projects. The same way when I got new pans for Christmas I was happy because I like to cook as a hobby. It's about knowing the person you're buying for. She's expressed she doesn't like it, don't do it again.", "That's exactly my point. She knows that she will only get baby stuff as gifts, Christmas or not. And wants his partner to get something for her rather than the baby while being completely devoid of the fact that he also has her gifts. \n\nAnd whats gifting at the shower. That must be an American thing. We dont have that where I am from.", "One year my husband asked what I wanted for Mother's Day. I said I really wanted a trampoline. I'll never forget my kids' faces. He got \"me\" one.", "My adult daughter specifically requests household things as Xmas gifts. One year is was a cast iron frying pan (quality ones are not cheap), another year it was a crockpot \n\nI always include something a bit more personal (an expensive mascara; Bad Gal Bang, by Benefit is the best ever!) Or earrings etc", "Hopefully OP also plans on using the pram.", "100%. My ex (daughters mum) really wanted a specific stroller for our daughter, but it was pricey as hell. I didn't see the need for it at the time, and my mum gave her grief for wanting such a needless item. But oh lordy, when it came time to use it, it was incredible. It folded down so far it could fit in any boot. It was sturdy, but light. The capsule it came with could be transferred directly from the mount in the car right onto the stroller base, so there was no need to wake a sleeping baby just to get them in the stroller, and it also had a cot attachment that absolutely saved us when ex had to go in for surgery so we were in the hospital for extended periods. Never been so goddamn wrong about an expensive purchase. Bonus hilarity was had when my mum had to struggle with her much cheaper stroller, cause it didn't fold down nearly far enough for her car, not to mention the lack of ability to move a sleeping baby into the stroller without waking them. Some things are worth the extra cost.", "The only thing we really splurged on was a good pram for kiddo, and we are so happy. Easy to maneuver, simple to pack in the car for when we go visiting, not too heavy. But I'm also from a country where babies take most of their naps in them, so we use it constantly.", "Yeah but he wouldn't have bought it if she didn't want it. He bought it for her", "And now that they've had this discussion, she might see the other gifts as extra things that he bought afterwards because of the argument.", "yeah, that\u2019s the point of Christmas gifts. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting until you open it.", "Yes. Not telling her was his only mistake imo.", "I\u2019m not a mother and never will be but I\u2019ve always hated how so many people forget the mother after a baby is born. It\u2019s why my husband and I always make sure to ask about the mum. We\u2019ve also noticed a lot of the time they\u2019ll start answering that \u201c(baby) is good\u201d and we have to clarify \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear, but we asked how are *you*?\u201d", "I watched that exact same one. It\u2019s why I mentioned it. We only do stockings for our kids but growing up my dad would always wait until my mom went to bed and made sure she had a full stocking as well. It\u2019s not that hard to remember that your partner is a person as well and deserves to have their stocking stuffed, without having to do it themselves", "It\u2019s the fact that no one should have to fill their own stocking, especially if they live with a partner.", "Sounds like you\u2019ve never been on the receiving end of filling everyone else\u2019s stockings but having an empty one yourself or having to fill it yourself. \n\nYes, we are moms, but Jesus fuck we are people, too. We shouldn\u2019t have to wake up to an empty stocking or a stocking that we had to fill ourselves.", "I paid $400 or so for the Jeep stroller and that was well worth it, so I can totally imagine how a $2000 stroller could be worth it to someone who can afford it, but I\u2019m really curious about what could be extra special about a designer diaper bag?", "Hey, I have no idea, don't have children and never plan to. \n\nBUT I know children stuff can be extremely expensive, sadly not only the vanity things but also the mundane every day shit u need to feed and care for the babies.", "She raised it with him and he confirmed he got her baby things as Christmas gifts. She doesn\u2019t THINK IN CAPS that he got her things for their baby, she knows.\n\nYou\u2019ve left a lot of comments accusing others of not reading the post, but you seem to have missed a lot of things in it yourself.", "He let her believe that and didn't explain well. They can just talk it out and solve it, I'm sure. Everyone expects gifts for Christmas from their partner and everyone has the right to not like a gift. This is not entitlement this is how it is commonly in our society. She is heavily pregnant to add to that, cut her some slack. Everyone wants to receive something just for them for Christmas.", "You can have more than one opinion about something. 1. That baby related stuff shouldn't be gifted in the future and 2. That she got some nice presents. \n\nOP's biggest issues is the doubling down after his wife expressed her feelings about the baby presents.", "You are not grasping that he shouldn't have included the baby items as a gift. Yes he has other presents for her. BUT items for the baby are not for HER. He can just buy them for the BABY.", "Aight found a wikipedia page about it and we dont do that here.", "Yeah. Even if he says anything now she'll think that he only bought those because of the argument.", "But he could have said there were other more personal gifts that he wanted to be a surprise.", "Keyword being YOU\u2019RE getting. The presents she thinks she\u2019s getting are for THEIR baby.", "Bless you for that!", "She got mad a week before Christmas even happened when she doesn\u2019t even know what all her gifts are. ENTITLED!", "And she will if she waited until actual Christmas to get her presents. Super entitled to be mad about your Christmas presents a week before the fucking thing.", "I think what changes it is the price. Babies absolutely do not NEED a 2,000 pram. Just wasteful for something you only use until a baby sits up so 6 months. But yeah he should have saved whatever he got for the baby shower.", "If he is fine with mid tier items and she really wants super expensive pricey TOP tier items then yeah that\u2019s a gift.", "Not really. Any usable stroller would be for the baby, a specific designer stroller is just for her to satisfy her brand and/or image and/or Instagram obsession.", "Thank you.\n\nThe way I see it, mum is a title added to the long list of what that person was before they had their baby. Becoming a mum doesn\u2019t erase the person they were before they became one and they should be treated as such.", "But he called them gifts! OP told her they were gifts. Whether she has other gifts is beside the point. Baby items are not gifts for the mother.", "oh no, she feels entitled!!1 ...to presents that are for HER??? and not only for the child that she is carrying for 9 months. \n\nhow dare she! vile woman who wants presents for Christmas that are  actually for herself and not for her child... disgusting incubator that wants to be treated like a person and not as a object for reproduction!!!11\n\n/s", "As a mom of 2, both me and my partner can tell you that a $2k pram and a $200 pram are completely different products. \n\nI can guide my $1700 pram with my little finger. My $450 stroller is a fricking nightmare to push.\n\nIt sounds as though they can afford better stuff (she even said she\u2019d save an pay for it). They absolutely do not perform the same as OP is making out and tbh it sounds like OPs other half is doing all the legwork looking into this stuff.", "Yeah he should have totally said that. Would have gone over well.   The point is that she thinks all the gifts for the baby. And even a stroller. Yes it is for a baby even if it's a nice one for you.", "If he wants a 200 dollar pram and she wants one that\u2019s 1800 dollars more expensive then yeah that\u2019s a gift.", "Women gets mad about Christmas presents\u2026. A week before Christmas. Yeah she\u2019s crazy entitled.", "Depends if it\u2019s just a pram or full travel system. Big difference and $2K is a reasonable price for a travel system.", "No it's not"]}
