It was my close friends New Year\u2019s party and the only people me and my parents knew there was my friends family. This woman came with her husband and her kid who I will call Sam and my brother I will call Jake. Sam took Jake\u2019s iPad and wouldn\u2019t let him use it or watch anything on it so my brother snatched it back from him and said they can share but he can\u2019t have the whole thing on his own. (They\u2019re 6 and 7 respectively) Sam started crying and told his mom and she started yelling at my brother for being selfish and not letting her son play on his iPad. My mom wasn\u2019t there and I\u2019m glad she wasn\u2019t because a whole fight would ensue so I stepped in. My brother told me what had happened with him and Sam and how his mom started yelling at him. I asked her about it and she said she was disciplining him. I told her that he didn\u2019t do any wrong and even if he did she\u2019s a stranger and has no right to reprimand a child that\u2019s not hers and that she should focus on her own child instead of someone else\u2019s. For the rest of the night she kept looking at me and making snide comments and practically pushing me and my family out of the way when we were waiting for the fireworks. She called my friends mother a few days ago and complained about how I was disrespecting an older woman and that I was very rude and treated her child horribly even though I didn\u2019t even speak to the kid because it\u2019s not my place to say anything to him. All I did was tell her not to discipline a child that isn\u2019t her own. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Jale wanted to share. He\u2019s a nice social kid  who loves to share. Sam wouldn\u2019t let him have the iPad and wanted it for himself without letting Jake watch or do anything.", "created_utc": 1673096779, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105om5v/aita_for_telling_a_woman_at_a_party_to_stop/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At school or something, if it\u2019s a community object/toy/etc? Sure. But no, my kid is NOT required to share her own stuff. If you want your kid to have an iPad/tablet, BUY THEM ONE.", "NTA.  You only step in to reprimand someone else\u2019s child if they are doing something dangerous / hurting another child / destroying your property.  Beyond that, it is the other parent\u2019s responsibility to teach their child how to behave, and yours to teach your child how to handle conflict.  It sounds like this woman isn\u2019t interested in doing that last, and would rather pick a fight with a teenager who\u2019s standing up for her little brother.  She should be embarrassed.", "NTA.  Let's just say there's nothing civil that could be said about someone trying to discipline a kid that's not theirs.", "NTA. It was your brother\u2019s ipad. If the other family wanted their son to use an ipad they could have brought/bought their own. Your brother was still kind to offer to watch it together. It\u2019s their child that needs some disclipine, not your brother.", "ESH. First and foremost why are these kids sitting around with their faces buried in an ipad at a social gathering? If they don't want to be at this function then find a babysitter so they can stay home. Second, it takes a village, you know. I have no problem correcting children if no one else will. But, she shouldn't be \"yelling\". There is an effective way to correct and yelling isn't usually it. Call me an asshole if you want, but that's how I roll. Third, you ought to be helping this child learn some healthy emotional control. These things are taught and learned through practice and leading by example. If he is allowed to act like this now do not expect him to do any different later. You are enforcing that he should not respect authority or adults in general, and that he should behave like a spoiled brat with no apologies. That ipad is the root of this problem. It is good and healthy to put the damned screen down and be a human being in the world. You all suck in this case.", "ESH (except the kids -- their behavior was normal 6-/7-year old behavior).\n\nIn my culture, it is inappropriate to discipline another person's child. But telling someone to mind their own business and focus on their kid sounds a bit aggressive.\n\nResolving squabbles between little children is often a communal undertaking. I can see why she might have wanted a resolution that encouraged sharing, but the way she went about it was wrong. She had no right to scold or yell at your brother. Had she merely spoken to Jake about sharing, and told him that if he wasn't willing to share the iPad with everyone at the party, he should put the device away, that would have been a reasonable thing for an adult to tell a kid in a communal space. But yelling and scolding someone else's child is not acceptable. \n\nYou did not respond calmly, though. It seems like you told her to back the f\\*\\* off (not in those words, of course ;) It would have been better had you told her that it was not her place to scold your brother, that she should have come to you with the issue, and that you would handle it. You could have given the iPad back to your brother, told him that if he is going to use it at the party, he needs to let other people use it as well (or whatever solution you thought was best -- maybe taking him to a different room where Sam wasn't around), etc. \n\nIt's a bit much that this woman is still harping on the issue though. \n\nhttps://genius.com/Kacey-musgraves-biscuits-lyrics", "\"Bang out of order,\" mind if I ask where you're from? I grew up saying this in London!\n\nAlso, completely agree! This parent sounds entitled to me, she said nothing to her son for rudely snatching someone else's property from them!", "Agreed. Nobody has a right to just take someone's property.", "I told my mom when I found out from my friend what she said to her mom and my mom told me that she was very proud of how she raised me and that I shouldn\u2019t pay that lady any mind because you cannot get to people like that because they\u2019re always going to think you\u2019re entitled.

He\u2019s a really nice and social kid but also knows when to be quiet.

And then they spread their unrighteous indignation to others for affirmation.

But \"Brava!\" for standing your ground and defending your little brother.  I don't think I would have had the nerve  at your age. And as a mothy old lady, I say wear the label of \"mouthy daughter\" with pride. \n\nThe thing that people like that don't realize is that they are usually only tolerated to keep the peace and that people usually see through their entitled BS.

I work with kids and try to teach that while it is nice to share, it\u2019s also ok to say no. Of course there are times when things do have to be shared and I do my best to explain this as well, I think that giving them the choice when possible helps them feel more comfortable with it and will hopefully help them create better boundaries for themselves in the future."]}
