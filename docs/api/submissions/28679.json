And that's what I did, I gave it to him with all my games so he could entertain himself with the condition he has to take care of it and that give it to me back when he left the hospital. But they had to change hospitals to a better one in another city and the Nintendo was forgotten in their house. I live in the other city so I haven't been able to go and get it. My nephew's birthday was a week ago and an friend of my family(F25) called me to ask me what model of the console I had GIFTED to my nephew. I was very surprised by her comment because my brother, my sister-in-law(F40) and my nephew knew that it was not a gift. So I let the woman know that there was a confusion.

But at the same time, my family has always had little money and with work I was able to buy that Nintendo as a birthday gift for myself. And it means a lot to me.

Is it possible there was a miscommunication and your brother actually thought you gifted it to nephew rather than just lending it?", "NTA\n\nIs it possible that there was a misunderstanding? Either way, NTA\n\nI\u2019m very sorry about your nephew and wish him well, but being ill does not make you obligated to give him your stuff.", "I think you are going to have hard time getting it back. Not saying that is right --just that not many Family members are going to see your side . NTA OP but think hard about whether you want to be known as the Family member who \" took away a gift\" from a child with cancer.", "YTA. The kid is getting treated for cancer. He had to move hospitals, which implies its at least more serious than thought. \n\nAlso, you didn\u2019t need to correct this random lady. You could have pulled your brother aside after all was said and done and cleared it up. \n\nIt was a nice gesture, but a sick kid is going to think it\u2019s a gift.

Could you get the family who wanted to buy games and a few other members to each chip in a bit to start a switch fund for him?", "NTA\n\nThey haven't given the switch back to you so effectively, they have taken it from you anyway because I suspect you will never see it again.\n\nI feel bad for your nephew and I wish him well as he is on a long and painful journey, but his parents are the ones that have behaved badly - not you.", "NTA- but honestly, you should have had more foresight and seen this comming. Relatives will ALWAYS try to get free shit for their kids when it comes to valuables that they can\u2019t (or don\u2019t want to) pay for. Lesson learned: don\u2019t lend out shit you\u2019re not prepared to lose.", "NTA and seconding this sentiment.\n\nDid you tell his parents point blank it was just a temporary thing?\n\nTo be honest I would never leave my switch overnight anywhere but my own home, and even when I\u2019ve lent it to the kiddos of the family it\u2019s always been only during the duration of the visit but I can understand it being hard to travel frequently enough to make that possible.", "I'm very sure I told them it was a lend.

I never thought my brother or sister-in-law thought the Switch was a gift, but yes, you are right in saying that they were worried and their minds were on more important matters.", "The sick kid was told it was only being borrowed.", "Yeah, I take care of mine too. That's why I told him to take care of it. And I know he would do it, he's a great kid. He had the switch for a week (before going to another city) and in that time I was thinking in saving some money and buying it one, and I still do, but now \\*sigh\\*", "Yeah, I read that, too. My point is that the sick kid is not going to hear that.", "He did hear it because that\u2019s what he was told."]}
