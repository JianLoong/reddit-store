And that's what I did, I gave it to him with all my games so he could entertain himself with the condition he has to take care of it and that give it to me back when he left the hospital. But they had to change hospitals to a better one in another city and the Nintendo was forgotten in their house. I live in the other city so I haven't been able to go and get it. My nephew's birthday was a week ago and an friend of my family(F25) called me to ask me what model of the console I had GIFTED to my nephew. I was very surprised by her comment because my brother, my sister-in-law(F40) and my nephew knew that it was not a gift. So I let the woman know that there was a confusion.

Either way, NTA\n\nI\u2019m very sorry about your nephew and wish him well, but being ill does not make you obligated to give him your stuff.", "I think you are going to have hard time getting it back. Not saying that is right --just that not many Family members are going to see your side .

He had to move hospitals, which implies its at least more serious than thought. \n\nAlso, you didn\u2019t need to correct this random lady. You could have pulled your brother aside after all was said and done and cleared it up. \n\nIt was a nice gesture, but a sick kid is going to think it\u2019s a gift.

Could you get the family who wanted to buy games and a few other members to each chip in a bit to start a switch fund for him?", "NTA\n\nThey haven't given the switch back to you so effectively, they have taken it from you anyway because I suspect you will never see it again.\n\nI feel bad for your nephew and I wish him well as he is on a long and painful journey, but his parents are the ones that have behaved badly - not you.", "NTA- but honestly, you should have had more foresight and seen this comming. Relatives will ALWAYS try to get free shit for their kids when it comes to valuables that they can\u2019t (or don\u2019t want to) pay for. Lesson learned: don\u2019t lend out shit you\u2019re not prepared to lose.", "NTA and seconding this sentiment.\n\nDid you tell his parents point blank it was just a temporary thing?\n\nTo be honest I would never leave my switch overnight anywhere but my own home, and even when I\u2019ve lent it to the kiddos of the family it\u2019s always been only during the duration of the visit but I can understand it being hard to travel frequently enough to make that possible.", "I'm very sure I told them it was a lend. I remember telling them so. I don't know where the 'gift' part came from. As another comment says, a worried parent is not thinking crearly, so maybe that's what happened. \n\nAnd thank you.", "Thank you for your wishes <3\n\nYeah I guess it's just a misunderstanding, I wish my brother would talk to me again, but, well, as long as I know that my nephew is okay (my mom keeps me informed), that's more than enough for me.", "I corrected the woman because I thought she was the one who misunderstood things. I never thought my brother or sister-in-law thought the Switch was a gift, but yes, you are right in saying that they were worried and their minds were on more important matters.", "The sick kid was told it was only being borrowed.", "Yeah, I take care of mine too. That's why I told him to take care of it. And I know he would do it, he's a great kid. He had the switch for a week (before going to another city) and in that time I was thinking in saving some money and buying it one, and I still do, but now \\*sigh\\*", "Yeah, I read that, too. My point is that the sick kid is not going to hear that.", "He did hear it because that\u2019s what he was told.", "you lied to noone. you gifted nothing. dont let them gaslight you. NTA", "NTA - To be honest, you should have thought about this a lot more and should never have loaned the switch to him unless you were prepared to lose it entirely.\n\nYou really should have known better. You were loaning a luxury kids toy/electronic to a child. Of course he's going to want it for himself, he doesn't understand why you would want it, for him that's a kids toy. \n\nI don't want to sound malicious, but is it possible that the boy lied to his parents and said, you gifted it to him? \nSome kids at that age start learning manipulative behavior, or might start trying to lie and see what they can get away with. (He could have learned this from outside the home, at school, tv, who knows.) It's also possible that he just was too sick, tired or maybe just did not understand what you told him at all and the only thing he knew was if he said yes to whatever you said he was getting the toy. \n\nAt this point if you were able to get back your switch then please do not loan it to him nor any other kids no matter what. It will save you the headaches. And if you weren't able to get your switch back, then see if at least the parents let you create his own account etc and teach them/show them how to manage it or you help them manage it (and remove your payment info).\n\nIf you did get your switch back, ask other family and friends to see if you can collect money for a new switch for your nephew. It can be a surprise to him and an apology to his parents.\n\nI'm really very sorry about his health and I hope he can make a quick recovery.", "NTA", "NTA they are trying to guilt you by using the nephew illness for personal gain of your item, they are the AH for trying to manipulate you.", "NTA", "It\u2019s probably likely that they slowly convinced themselves that it was a gift the longer it stayed with them, and that surely you wouldn\u2019t \u201ctake back\u201d such a thing from a sick child, etc. \n\nTheir fault and not yours.", "You have no point because they knew, you can try all the mental gymnastics it won\u2019t change the fact that they knew it was temporary", "You have no point... lots of down votes.... but no point"]}
