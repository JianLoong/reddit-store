We broke up around 4 and a half years ago after he went to prison. A month later I found out that I was pregnant. He was released a few weeks ago.\n\nEarlier today, I ran into him while shopping. We ended up talking for a bit. I had my son with me and he asked about his name and how old he is. When I told him, he got kind of a weird look on his face but didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nI didn\u2019t really think anything of it and continued on with my day. A few hours later I got a call from an unknown number. It was my ex asking me directly if my son was his. I told him he was. He wanted to know why I never told him. I said it didn\u2019t matter because he was literally in prison for 5 years and my boyfriend had been the one to support me through everything.\n\nI could hear him get more and more agitated and he demanded that I let him see my son. I told him if he calls beforehand we can work something out. He agreed to it and I thought that was it.\n\nI then got a text from a mutual friend asking me if it was true that my ex is the father of my son and that I never told him. I said it is true to which he called me a bitch for keeping my ex away from his son. I told to mind his own business.\n\nWhen my boyfriend got home from work I told him what happened and he said he would be fine with my ex seeing our son from time to time. We started dating while I was pregnant and he loves our son like his own and is actually in the process of adopting him. I know that he doesn\u2019t like my ex very much and if he had said no, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to letting my ex come by from time to time.\n\nAround 2 hours ago (9p.m.) my ex showed up at our door with a stuffed teddy and some toy cars. He said he was here to see his son and demanded that we let him in. I told him that it was already past my son\u2019s bedtime and that he should come back tomorrow. He ended up trying to push his way in and when that didn\u2019t work he started yelling that I\u2019m a lying bitch, that I have no right to keep him away from his son and that he just wanted to see him. My boyfriend tried to de-escalate things which ended in a fight. My ex then left and I told him to call next time before coming over.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t want him to come over at all anymore and said I shouldn\u2019t have told him that he\u2019s the father. I do feel kind of bad now because if I had handled this differently all this drama could\u2019ve been avoided.\n\nShould I have told him immediately?

I know that some people will say I'm heartless, but it sounds like you have a great partner now and you are both doing the best you can for your boy.", "Yes...you definitely should have handled this differently.  Don't have sex or children with criminals...", "NTA. i'm not here to give legal advice. morally you aren't the asshole. according to your comments, you and your ex started dating when he was 18/19 and you were 14/15, and he went to prison for beating someone up with a baton. on top of that, he tried to trespass and got violent. men like these get angry over their children not because they really care about them but because they feel entitled to some kind of biological legacy. dgaf if i get downvoted but no sane person would let their child around a predator with anger issues.", "Make importantly, why didn\u2019t you call the cops when he tried to invade your home and attack your bf? And what was he in prison for?", "NTA. It's not a good situation to be in. You should consult a lawyer to make sure your custody isn't at risk. If he tries anything like that again call the police. If he just got out of prison, he's probably on parole so he can't risk this kind of behavior.

Does that mean you were 14/15 while he was 18/19 when you started dating?", "Ok maybe unpopular take here, but honestly absolutely YTA. Your ex was going to prison for 5 years, not for life. The mere fact of incarceration doesn\u2019t somehow magically immediately terminate someone\u2019s rights as a parent. And it definitely isn\u2019t an excuse for you to just take matters into your own hands and deny them the right or opportunity to meet and get to know their kid. Or to even know of the fact that they even exist in the first place. That\u2019s honestly just cruel. \n\nIf you were concerned ab safety or propriety, your options were to try to work it out amongst yourselves or to go to family court and present your case to a judge. You did not have the right to decide on your own that a bio parent wasn\u2019t entitled to know they had a kid and wasn\u2019t entitled to develop any relationship with that child. My best guess is that barring any abuse or safety concerns, some type of visitation schedule would have been set up that was geared towards establishing a relationship that could be built upon once bio dad was released. Again, your kid is FOUR YEARS OLD. That is plenty young enough to develop a healthy and meaningful relationship with a parent figure. You deprived him of that all on your own. And to try to cast him as the villain now, for acting out upon learning such earth shattering info, and for wanting to meet and see his kid, is very dishonest. Imagine if your roles were reversed, how do you think you\u2019d act and what lengths do you think you\u2019d be willing to go to in order to meet your kid and let them know you hadn\u2019t abandoned them/that you want and love them? I bet you\u2019d be willing to kick in a few doors too. Especially after realizing that someone else was standing in your place. \n\n\nIt is wonderful that your current bf has stepped up and is such a present father figure for your child. And your child deserved to have a present father figure. It is also inexcusable that you took that opportunity away from the bio dad completely, and by the sounds of it never would have told him if you hadn\u2019t been caught and called out. Your bf\u2019s role and your kid\u2019s bio dad\u2019s role are not at all mutually exclusive. You would have just needed to work a little harder to make room and make it work. So I repeat, maybe unpopular opinion, but emphatic YTA.", "Yta, your boyfriend can\u2019t adopt your son if the father doesn\u2019t allow it. Your ex is his father and has a legal right to get to know his son. You would do well to talk to a lawyer to actually know what you can and cannot control. Your ex should get a lawyer as well to establish his rights", "I can't really afford legal fees right now so I have to stick to strangers right now unless anything serious happens", "This right here, you lied by omission to the father for five years and are trying to act like he should have no rights to his son. You are the one who has been lying from the beginning and lied on the birth certificate that you didn\u2019t know the father. He has every right to be involved in his sons life, regardless of past mistakes. It\u2019s not for you to decide. He was definitely in the wrong for showing up late at night and causing a fight, but put yourself in his shoes you have denied him the last five years of his sons life that he will never get back, imagine if the situation was reversed!", "My ex isn't registered as the father. I said I didn't know who the dad was at the time. Technically I think he'd have to prove paternity first and I'm not sure he'll stay interested for that long", "I don't want to keep him away from my son. He can visit and spend time with him. I just don't want him to show up unannounced again\n\nI know he won't got to court over this. We dated for almost 8 years, I know him pretty well.

It's not a game changer because of the situation.  Judges will be sympathetic to him on this.  But it is leverage.", "It's also not about him or the OP.\n\nIt's about the child in question.\n\nYes, he deserved better than having a father in prison but he also deserves better than a mother who deprives him of a relationship with his biological father before he's old enough to make that decision for himself.\n\nNow, it's hard to say if she did the right thing not telling ex about his son. We don't know what he went to prison for or what their relationship was like beforehand and it doesn't sound like he's respecting their boundaries now. But unless she honestly thinks he's dangerous or a harmful presence for their child, she's doing them both a disservice by putting up a wall.\n\nAnd if her son grows up and wants a relationship with his bio dad and then finds out she purposely kept that from him, it will irreparably damage their relationship. Parenting is all about the long game.", "He won't go to court over this. He doesn't have the money to pay for a lawyer and he also has multiple criminal charges. He went to prison for assaulting someone with a baton.
