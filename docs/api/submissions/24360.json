A few hours later I got a call from an unknown number. It was my ex asking me directly if my son was his. I told him he was. He wanted to know why I never told him. I said it didn\u2019t matter because he was literally in prison for 5 years and my boyfriend had been the one to support me through everything.\n\nI could hear him get more and more agitated and he demanded that I let him see my son. I told him if he calls beforehand we can work something out. He agreed to it and I thought that was it.\n\nI then got a text from a mutual friend asking me if it was true that my ex is the father of my son and that I never told him. I said it is true to which he called me a bitch for keeping my ex away from his son. I told to mind his own business.\n\nWhen my boyfriend got home from work I told him what happened and he said he would be fine with my ex seeing our son from time to time. We started dating while I was pregnant and he loves our son like his own and is actually in the process of adopting him. I know that he doesn\u2019t like my ex very much and if he had said no, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to letting my ex come by from time to time.\n\nAround 2 hours ago (9p.m.) my ex showed up at our door with a stuffed teddy and some toy cars. He said he was here to see his son and demanded that we let him in. I told him that it was already past my son\u2019s bedtime and that he should come back tomorrow. He ended up trying to push his way in and when that didn\u2019t work he started yelling that I\u2019m a lying bitch, that I have no right to keep him away from his son and that he just wanted to see him. My boyfriend tried to de-escalate things which ended in a fight. My ex then left and I told him to call next time before coming over.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t want him to come over at all anymore and said I shouldn\u2019t have told him that he\u2019s the father. I do feel kind of bad now because if I had handled this differently all this drama could\u2019ve been avoided.\n\nShould I have told him immediately?

Does that mean you were 14/15 while he was 18/19 when you started dating?", "Ok maybe unpopular take here, but honestly absolutely YTA. Your ex was going to prison for 5 years, not for life. The mere fact of incarceration doesn\u2019t somehow magically immediately terminate someone\u2019s rights as a parent. And it definitely isn\u2019t an excuse for you to just take matters into your own hands and deny them the right or opportunity to meet and get to know their kid. Or to even know of the fact that they even exist in the first place. That\u2019s honestly just cruel. \n\nIf you were concerned ab safety or propriety, your options were to try to work it out amongst yourselves or to go to family court and present your case to a judge. You did not have the right to decide on your own that a bio parent wasn\u2019t entitled to know they had a kid and wasn\u2019t entitled to develop any relationship with that child. My best guess is that barring any abuse or safety concerns, some type of visitation schedule would have been set up that was geared towards establishing a relationship that could be built upon once bio dad was released. Again, your kid is FOUR YEARS OLD. That is plenty young enough to develop a healthy and meaningful relationship with a parent figure. You deprived him of that all on your own. And to try to cast him as the villain now, for acting out upon learning such earth shattering info, and for wanting to meet and see his kid, is very dishonest. Imagine if your roles were reversed, how do you think you\u2019d act and what lengths do you think you\u2019d be willing to go to in order to meet your kid and let them know you hadn\u2019t abandoned them/that you want and love them? I bet you\u2019d be willing to kick in a few doors too. Especially after realizing that someone else was standing in your place. \n\n\nIt is wonderful that your current bf has stepped up and is such a present father figure for your child. And your child deserved to have a present father figure. It is also inexcusable that you took that opportunity away from the bio dad completely, and by the sounds of it never would have told him if you hadn\u2019t been caught and called out. Your bf\u2019s role and your kid\u2019s bio dad\u2019s role are not at all mutually exclusive. You would have just needed to work a little harder to make room and make it work. So I repeat, maybe unpopular opinion, but emphatic YTA.", "Yta, your boyfriend can\u2019t adopt your son if the father doesn\u2019t allow it.

We don't know what he went to prison for or what their relationship was like beforehand and it doesn't sound like he's respecting their boundaries now. But unless she honestly thinks he's dangerous or a harmful presence for their child, she's doing them both a disservice by putting up a wall.\n\nAnd if her son grows up and wants a relationship with his bio dad and then finds out she purposely kept that from him, it will irreparably damage their relationship.

I can no longer say that my mother loved me unconditionally knowing that she told the man who makes up half of my DNA that he could be in my life over her dead body. She altered the course of our three lives with that selfish choice and has to face none of my emotional toil now. My father, his side of my family and her friends are being kind enough to not speak too ill of the dead but I would love to have a strong word with her and ask why she got to have two parents and live a solidly middle class lifestyle while I got to be her emotional support child through every one of her unstable ups and downs.", "NTA, call the cops about the parolee trying to force his way into your house.

You can\u2019t just erase biological father from the picture. This would mean lying your son\u2019s whole life and we all know that never ends well.  Edited to explain who I\u2019m talking about lol", "ESH.", "NTA. \n\nBut lawyer. Especially if your in the process of your boyfriend adopting your son.", "NTA. Speak to a lawyer.", "NTA. He was in prison. Prison visiting rooms aren't exactly ideal for toddlers.\n\nThe problem now is he's going to try and fight for custody. Luckily for you, you set out very reasonable boundaries (call and schedule a time to see the kid), and instead he showed up at 9pm demanding access to your home and acting belligerent.\n\nAt minimum, you should call the non-emergency line and make a police report. You'll want it for the custody battle he's going to start. And it's better you file your report before he files for visitation.", "OP, have you even considered yet what you are doing to your son? How he will feel later on about all of this? Are you thinking about it now? Do you want him back in prison, where you will likely be required to take your son since he now knows? Not even considering what the ex's parents will do, if they are around. \n\nYTA. Of course you should have told him immediately. My goodness, you act like it was an immaculate conception. He couldn't have been that bad, you stopped and chatted with him at the grocery store. You have made a GIANT mess of everyone's lives around you. Clean it up.", "YTA \n\nYou should have told him when you were pregnant. Both parents have rights, and you basically tried to steal his kid. Yes your son is your kid, but he\u2019s his kid too. \n\nAlso, idk how it can be legal for your BF to adopt your son without your ex signing away his parental rights. But that\u2019s shady for you to do that. \n\nIdk what country you\u2019re in, but it\u2019s very likely your ex has legal visitation rights. So it\u2019s not up to you or you BF how often he gets to see his kid.", "YTA  \nThe biological father seems to be an AH too, but: You just effed up the adoption process and caused a major disruption in your sons life.   \nIt's no longer a matter of what you should have done, but how and if you can fing a working path forward from here.", "YTA. What your ex did isn't okay but can you blame him? If someone dropped that bomb on me I'd be seeing red, I can't say that I wouldn't do something in the heat of the moment. \n\nNo matter how crap your ex is what you did is so messed up. You robbed both your ex and your son of the first 5 years of your sons life, that's unforgivable. And your BF needs to back off, at the end of the day your son isn't his.", "If you didn\u2019t tell him years, what prompt to tell now? You are TA for not sticking up with your decision and creating all this needless drama.", "I\u2019m going with NTA because he\u2019s causing you trouble already. This is going to be so confusing for your son. I think you should sort out visitation properly with the courts. Not just have him coming round your house whenever he feels like it.", "NTA but I would have gone to my grave with that secret. Get a lawyer ASAP.", "100% YTA for not telling him. It is his child too and not telling him is fucking fucked up. Idk who you think you are but you have no right. He deserves to know.\n\nDoes that excuse his trying to barge in? No, but I sure can see why he'd be pissed at you.", "Judges HATE this.", ">Well the adoption is off the table unless ex sign off his rights.\n\nNot if she left him off the birth certificate, unfortunately for him. \n\nYes, OP, YTA.", "OP isn't even in part an asshole for lying to both her ex and medical staff about the fact he's a father?? are you serious??", "I mean how would you feel if you found out after 5 years and got out early that you actually had a child. To find out from a random encounter. Its would be absolutely devastating. From my interviews of prisoners one of the hardest things to surviving prison is finding a reason to carry on. To have a life goal and finally get out only to then be sideswiped is straight up damaging to people.", "she just said that she lied on the register and said she didn\u2019t know who the father was\u2026 she\u2019s in big BIG trouble if the ex sues", "Dude, the father is obviously violent and shouldn\u2019t be around the kid. Come off it.", "Ffs, just when you think it can\u2019t get worse.", "And even if he couldn't be there for the child he still deserved to KNOW about him.", "What OP has committed is a typePaternity fraud(which doesn't really exist but exists as a sub set to a civil based damages felony called Tort of Deceit which is a type of damages fraud)  there are many ways in which this can play out that would directly hurt the EX in both past and future. As a result her lying about who the father is for years ad then springing on both the EX and the friend can absolutely have both physical, mental and economic damage on the EX. For instance in the US at any point before the child is 18 she can file for child support against the Bio father because he legally didn't give up parental rights. She could claim for legal purposes that she had a paternity test done on the child and found out who the father really was. Meaning that's legally he owes the back ammount of child support that wasn't paid. INCLUDING while he was incarcerated. That back owe is instantly due and you have to use specialized payment plans. Meaning up to 17 years of debt instantly  factored on current job income. Potentially in the 40s or 50s of thousands.\n\nIf the child turned 18 and he still didn't know then at 18 the child with whom he didn't have causing emotional, mental, social and if he has a family familial damages.\n\nThe laws for tort of deceit state knowingly or recklessly.  Of which this would be knowing hiding the child from their biological father without due cause as they state it was because their BF was there for them while the EX was imprisoned not due to duress. So yeah that will not go well on the ensuing custody case", "What's your reasoning?", "Something serious has already happened.\n\nA man just found out that he has a child that he didn't know about.\n\nHe has legal rights, and it sounds like he's going to pursue them. \n\nGet. A. Lawyer.", "The cost of NOT having a lawyer is losing partial or even full custody of your child, and the fact that your boyfriends adoption of your son is probably dead in the water. \n\nA family lawyer is meant to *prevent* serious things from happening. \n\nYour ex has parental rights that he is starting to assert. He can claim custody and a say in your parenting decisions \u2014 medical care for your kid, school choice, he can even prevent you from moving home. Unless there is a legal status *negotiated and filed by a lawyer* stating otherwise.", "You can\u2019t afford to NOT have a lawyer.  You\u2019ve already shown that your judgment is iffy and when you throw in your boyfriend trying to adopt a child whose father HAS NOT given up his parental rights, you\u2019re not going to fare well.\n\nTry doing right by your son and do this right.", "You need to take yourself down to your local welfare office and ask them about family attorneys. They might know of local sliding scale options or local orgs that can help you.", "You\u2019re going to need a good one should your ex file for his rights to the child.", "In many states, the father cannot be added if the child is born outside of marriage and often then requires the father\u2019s signature. Otherwise you could put anybody down.", "In my state, unless you are married, you can't just name someone as the father on the birth certificate. The father has to sign an acknowledgement of paternity form. Kind of hard to do that when you're in prison.", "He can easily file for his parental rights which means the the adoption will have to come to a stop.", "He\u2019s a violent criminal. I\u2019m gonna be honest, she should have told the guy the kid isn\u2019t his, and moved on.\n\nNTA.", "Nope, the guy is dangerous.", "no, she's not. first off, nowhere does it state she lied to medical staff. second, the dude was literally in prison when she gave birth.", "Its wild that thats top comment, he deserved to know he was a father regardless of his prison sentence.", "I don't think we should feel sorry for this violent dude with 5 assault charges.", ">I said I didn't know who the dad was at the time.\n\nHave you received any state aid for the child? SNAP, WIC, state insurance, medicaid?", "I don\u2019t know about violent. VERY poor decision making yes, as from the incarceration. But who knows what it was for? How would you react, knowing you had a child out there that you didn\u2019t know of for 5 years, then you\u2019re right outside the house? I don\u2019t condone his actions at all, but any sane man or woman who would want to be in the kids life, would probably go crazy lol", "[deleted]", "He\u2019s not. He can get paternity, but he\u2019s violent and disturbing. Lawyers need to be involved ASAP.", "Is this truly how you want your son to view the world? Never reporting violence because it\u2019s likely not worth the hassle? Keep in mind that at this point, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any adults setting a responsible example. If his own mother isn\u2019t willing to report clear mistreatment, do you really think he\u2019ll build boundaries and a healthy mindset?\nIt almost sounds like your desensitized to mistreatment. Regardless of severity, the adults in this situation need to step it up for your son\u2019s s sake.", ">We dated for almost 8 years, I know him pretty well\n\nAnd he was in prison for 5 afterwards, that shit changes people, hell, just 5 years in general can change people. You really don't know him now as well as you think you do, and things get real messy and complicated once you bring kids into things, don't be naive- *prepare*.", "Okay, is everyone overlooking the fact OP did not tell the father about the child? You can\u2019t sign a birth certificate for a child you don\u2019t know about. There has to be a system in place for incarcerated people to sign their kids birth certificates.", "I agree.  that was her mistake.", "Seriously, unsure of why ex was jailed but if he was just recently released couldn\u2019t probation be likely? So maybe don\u2019t start a fight/physical altercation because it will only serve to prove OP is better off keeping him out of the son\u2019s life", "Both could be true", "Yes, women should always advocate for contact with violent criminals /s.", "Depends on the crime", "That\u2019s a good point. Will having lied on those forms be considered fraud?", "OP said in the comments assault with a baton.\n\nEdit to add: and apparently he started dating OP when she was 14 and he was 18 so there\u2019s that too.", "read OPs comments. he went to jail for violent assault", "They should have called the police and had him returned to prison, that is a great point.", "The court can decide if hes fit to have contact, whether it\u2019s supervised or not. He should still know he has a child.", "He tried to force his way into the house and fought with the BF.  That is enough for me.", "Yes, because courts protect kids from getting killed by abusive parents all the time", "Your advice is going to get someone killed.  Just stop.", "The court had already decided by putting him in prison before she even learned she was pregnant. Get off your soapbox, ain\u2019t nobody listening", "\n\n>He should still know he has a child.\n\nand now he does. she had no obligation to pass that message onto him while he was locked up.", ">He went to prison for assaulting someone with a baton. \n\nAnd now you and your boyfriend are keeping him from his kid. You're really downplaying the situation here. Prison changes people. He's not the guy you used to know.", "He doesn\u2019t need to get a lawyer. He could walk into family court tomorrow, petition the court for paternity, and then try and petition for custody. No lawyer needed.", "Advice of going to court? Should everyone just take things into their own hands then?", "No, she didnt have an obligation to tell him but not telling him makes her an ah.", "\"he's not the guy you used to know\"\n\nReally? Cause the first thing he did here was pick a fight, that doesn't seem like a lot of change", "So you'd rather a court force the kid to have a violent criminal (still violent and unstable by the looks of it) in his life??", "She should never have told him he was the father, that was her mistake.", "yes, protecting her life against a violent male makes her the AH /s.  You are a stunning misogynist.", "You have no idea what the court would decide. The courts could have said he was unfit for any custody, they could have granted him supervised visitation but he deserved to know he was a father.", "Hot take, not everyone deserves to be a parent, I'm all fro criminals having proper reformation and second chances, but the truth is this dude is only going to cause problems and probably traumatize his son."]}
