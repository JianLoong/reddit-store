A few hours later I got a call from an unknown number. It was my ex asking me directly if my son was his. I told him he was. He wanted to know why I never told him. I said it didn\u2019t matter because he was literally in prison for 5 years and my boyfriend had been the one to support me through everything.\n\nI could hear him get more and more agitated and he demanded that I let him see my son. I told him if he calls beforehand we can work something out. He agreed to it and I thought that was it.\n\nI then got a text from a mutual friend asking me if it was true that my ex is the father of my son and that I never told him. I said it is true to which he called me a bitch for keeping my ex away from his son. I told to mind his own business.\n\nWhen my boyfriend got home from work I told him what happened and he said he would be fine with my ex seeing our son from time to time. We started dating while I was pregnant and he loves our son like his own and is actually in the process of adopting him. I know that he doesn\u2019t like my ex very much and if he had said no, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to letting my ex come by from time to time.\n\nAround 2 hours ago (9p.m.) my ex showed up at our door with a stuffed teddy and some toy cars. He said he was here to see his son and demanded that we let him in. I told him that it was already past my son\u2019s bedtime and that he should come back tomorrow. He ended up trying to push his way in and when that didn\u2019t work he started yelling that I\u2019m a lying bitch, that I have no right to keep him away from his son and that he just wanted to see him. My boyfriend tried to de-escalate things which ended in a fight. My ex then left and I told him to call next time before coming over.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t want him to come over at all anymore and said I shouldn\u2019t have told him that he\u2019s the father. I do feel kind of bad now because if I had handled this differently all this drama could\u2019ve been avoided.\n\nShould I have told him immediately?

Does that mean you were 14/15 while he was 18/19 when you started dating?", "Ok maybe unpopular take here, but honestly absolutely YTA. Your ex was going to prison for 5 years, not for life. The mere fact of incarceration doesn\u2019t somehow magically immediately terminate someone\u2019s rights as a parent. And it definitely isn\u2019t an excuse for you to just take matters into your own hands and deny them the right or opportunity to meet and get to know their kid. Or to even know of the fact that they even exist in the first place. That\u2019s honestly just cruel. \n\nIf you were concerned ab safety or propriety, your options were to try to work it out amongst yourselves or to go to family court and present your case to a judge. You did not have the right to decide on your own that a bio parent wasn\u2019t entitled to know they had a kid and wasn\u2019t entitled to develop any relationship with that child. My best guess is that barring any abuse or safety concerns, some type of visitation schedule would have been set up that was geared towards establishing a relationship that could be built upon once bio dad was released. Again, your kid is FOUR YEARS OLD. That is plenty young enough to develop a healthy and meaningful relationship with a parent figure. You deprived him of that all on your own. And to try to cast him as the villain now, for acting out upon learning such earth shattering info, and for wanting to meet and see his kid, is very dishonest. Imagine if your roles were reversed, how do you think you\u2019d act and what lengths do you think you\u2019d be willing to go to in order to meet your kid and let them know you hadn\u2019t abandoned them/that you want and love them? I bet you\u2019d be willing to kick in a few doors too. Especially after realizing that someone else was standing in your place. \n\n\nIt is wonderful that your current bf has stepped up and is such a present father figure for your child. And your child deserved to have a present father figure. It is also inexcusable that you took that opportunity away from the bio dad completely, and by the sounds of it never would have told him if you hadn\u2019t been caught and called out. Your bf\u2019s role and your kid\u2019s bio dad\u2019s role are not at all mutually exclusive. You would have just needed to work a little harder to make room and make it work. So I repeat, maybe unpopular opinion, but emphatic YTA.", "Yta, your boyfriend can\u2019t adopt your son if the father doesn\u2019t allow it.

We don't know what he went to prison for or what their relationship was like beforehand and it doesn't sound like he's respecting their boundaries now. But unless she honestly thinks he's dangerous or a harmful presence for their child, she's doing them both a disservice by putting up a wall.\n\nAnd if her son grows up and wants a relationship with his bio dad and then finds out she purposely kept that from him, it will irreparably damage their relationship.

I can no longer say that my mother loved me unconditionally knowing that she told the man who makes up half of my DNA that he could be in my life over her dead body. She altered the course of our three lives with that selfish choice and has to face none of my emotional toil now. My father, his side of my family and her friends are being kind enough to not speak too ill of the dead but I would love to have a strong word with her and ask why she got to have two parents and live a solidly middle class lifestyle while I got to be her emotional support child through every one of her unstable ups and downs.", "NTA, call the cops about the parolee trying to force his way into your house.

But do NOT allow yourself to trampled on or taken advantage of or abused or anything else to facilitate the relationship.  If he wants a relationship with his child, you absolutely need to allow it.

This is enormous, life changing information. And he clearly wants to be a father, not a deadbeat, so it seems like the intention to be better is there. I hope they can grow and become better", "He's probably on parole so if he shows up again and tries to force his way in or start a fight, they can call the cops and send him back to jail.", ">Yes, judges often side with violent criminals that assault people with batons, date 14 year olds when they are adults and try to break into houses. /s\n\n\nWell. Yes. They do. \n\nNone of those get your parental rights terminated in the USA.\n\nOP should have just kept \"not knowing\" if she didn't want him in their lives.", "LOL none of that was in the post I commented on. This is some trash stuff going on. If he did all that, I have two questions.  Why did she chat him up at the grocery store? Why was her bf fine with him seeing the kid?\n\nSounds like someone is backpedaling.", "I don't know about \"easily\", but yes, he can establish paternity. In some states, it's harder to do than in others. Some states purposefully make it difficult for unmarried fathers to establish paternity, usually to make it easier for would-be adoptive parents. (I'm looking at you, Utah!)\n\nAlso, just realized that OP didn't explicitly say they were in the US. I have no idea what other countries do.", "In the comments op said she told the medical staff she didn't know who the father was when she did, which is a lie. And since she admitted to it over text to a mutual friend who is clearly on the ex's side it is a lie that will get her in trouble when she inevitably goes to court", "Loool wtf, are you ok? What went down was not okay but why on earth would you not tell someone about their son. He has every right to know.\n\n1. How did you decide he's dangerous? We don't know why he went to prison.\n2. Whatever he was, dangerous or not, she was aware of it when she had a kid with him.\n\nIt's his damn kid.", "I don't blame any man for getting violent when being told their child was hidden from them for 5 years and they're not even allowed to see them", "He went to jail for assaulting someone with a baton.  He was 18 and OP was 14 when they started dating.", "Can't find the comment where OP states it was 5 assault charges. Can you link?", "In most states, unwed mothers can\u2019t just put someone\u2019s name down on the birth certificate. Not only does the father have to sign that he\u2019s the father, in my state they have to get a paternity affidavit notarized.", "Don't be fucking ridiculous \ud83d\ude02\n\nSome are guessing us I'm guessing british, You think somebody convicted for something worthy of a 5 year stretch, which means a 10 year sentence here you do half, who's apparently already caused one breach of the peace while on probation, is going to suddenly get custody of a kid lol.\n\nRight so it's the USA I think but it was for a violent assault and will probably still be on some sort of parole, just get evidence if he comes around being violent", "I just want to point out; OP is 26, ex is 30, and they started dating over 12 years ago. When they started dating, OP was 14 and ex was 18. I really wouldn't trust the ex.", "If the guy was also abusive during your relationship, you may be eligible for free legal through abuse organizations.", "Don't burden your current boyfriend then with adoption, he'll simply be stuck in this mess you've created. You had to be legally safe by mentioning just for courtesy while he was in prison. There's no need to entertain him of course but DNA test and the eventual court hassle is the only way to solve this.\n\nI sense an eventual breakup here. Poor boyfriend stuck between immature people, the ex bf also quite dangerous. ESH you more though for not respecting how well your boyfriend has stepped up and now expect him to adopt officially. He absolutely should not, given the history. He can't I guess because the ex might want to exercise rights.", "The OP put it in the comments, you missed it.  It has been there for quite a while and it fits the pattern.  Why do you think people go to prison, jaywalking?  He tried to break into the house, there is absolutely no basis for doubting this new info.  And the original post was enough, judges do not like criminals as a rule.", "She was dealing with a violent criminal that she started dating at 14 when he was 18.  I cut her slack for that, guys like that kill people.", "It\u2019s not his kid. He may be the bio, but he ain\u2019t the daddy. And if he isn\u2019t on the birth certificate he doesn\u2019t have any rights. No visitation, no child support, no nothing. He\u2019s been absent, and then immediately violent; legally and ethically the best option is to keep him away from children.\n\nThere is no obligation on her part to list some deadbeat as the potential father and hand over parenting rights when she knows she\u2019s going to be the only parent. Give your head a shake. A child is a responsibility,  not a toy or object to be owned. The kid sounds like they\u2019ve already got a dad.", "Because he showed up randomly and tried to force his way in", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15novq2/aita_for_not_telling_my_ex_the_truth_about_my_son/jvnhijr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2\n\nShit, sorry rereading comments it just says multiple assault charges, don't know if I misread or a comment was deleted", "Yes and depending on the \u201clevel\u201d of lie, as well as how much she lied, it can be up to a felony for SNAP alone.", "Well she can always say she slept with more than one dude and wasent sure..", "Exactly. His actions have shown a possibility for why she made her decisions. I get being made for not being told. But that was NOT a rational way to try to push his demands. Lawyer up. He can start on child support. Taking responsibility is many layers but invading someone's home is not one of them.", "That doesn't change the fact that she's going about this the wrong way with her \"let's settle this without cops/lawyers/courts\" attitude that is probably the worst way to deal with violent criminals. This attitude can, will, and already has put herself, her son, and her boyfriend in danger. She's also made a few mistakes such as the admission to a 3rd party that is clearly on the ex's side, that will not play out in her favor, when this inevitably goes to court. I frankly think she's the ah for refusing to go through official channels and putting herself and those around her in danger as a result", "Actually he IS the guy she used to know: he attempts to solve his problems with violence.", "What am I reading here? Reddit is an absolute asylum\n\nMan goes to prison for 5 years for a violent assault and you're here saying, give this man your child now without any clue of the circumstances lol\n\nAlso OP was 14 and the guy 18, yeah sounds fantastic, keep fighting for his rights you saviour.", "Yeah\u2026 in my career I\u2019ve seen ALOT of people go Pro Se in family court. And judges will 9/10 times help them as much as they can. Even people with a history of violence, courts try to be impartial and help Amy side without adequate representation at least until the time of judgment.", "And immediately owe 4 years back child support. Mention money and I bet he decides he's not so eager to be a father, at least not in the legal sense.", "The courts prioritize parents rights over the lives and wellbeing of children all the time.", "TIL.. me and my ovaries are misogynist!", "You are supporting someone who at the age of 18, started dating a 14 year old.  Then he violently assaulted someone with a baton and tried to force his way into Ops house.  Sorry, you will never convince me to put OPs life at risk."]}
