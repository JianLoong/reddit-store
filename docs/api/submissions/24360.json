A few hours later I got a call from an unknown number. It was my ex asking me directly if my son was his. I told him he was. He wanted to know why I never told him. I said it didn\u2019t matter because he was literally in prison for 5 years and my boyfriend had been the one to support me through everything.\n\nI could hear him get more and more agitated and he demanded that I let him see my son. I told him if he calls beforehand we can work something out. He agreed to it and I thought that was it.\n\nI then got a text from a mutual friend asking me if it was true that my ex is the father of my son and that I never told him. I said it is true to which he called me a bitch for keeping my ex away from his son. I told to mind his own business.\n\nWhen my boyfriend got home from work I told him what happened and he said he would be fine with my ex seeing our son from time to time. We started dating while I was pregnant and he loves our son like his own and is actually in the process of adopting him. I know that he doesn\u2019t like my ex very much and if he had said no, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to letting my ex come by from time to time.\n\nAround 2 hours ago (9p.m.) my ex showed up at our door with a stuffed teddy and some toy cars. He said he was here to see his son and demanded that we let him in. I told him that it was already past my son\u2019s bedtime and that he should come back tomorrow. He ended up trying to push his way in and when that didn\u2019t work he started yelling that I\u2019m a lying bitch, that I have no right to keep him away from his son and that he just wanted to see him. My boyfriend tried to de-escalate things which ended in a fight. My ex then left and I told him to call next time before coming over.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t want him to come over at all anymore and said I shouldn\u2019t have told him that he\u2019s the father. I do feel kind of bad now because if I had handled this differently all this drama could\u2019ve been avoided.\n\nShould I have told him immediately?

Does that mean you were 14/15 while he was 18/19 when you started dating?", "Ok maybe unpopular take here, but honestly absolutely YTA. Your ex was going to prison for 5 years, not for life. The mere fact of incarceration doesn\u2019t somehow magically immediately terminate someone\u2019s rights as a parent. And it definitely isn\u2019t an excuse for you to just take matters into your own hands and deny them the right or opportunity to meet and get to know their kid. Or to even know of the fact that they even exist in the first place. That\u2019s honestly just cruel. \n\nIf you were concerned ab safety or propriety, your options were to try to work it out amongst yourselves or to go to family court and present your case to a judge. You did not have the right to decide on your own that a bio parent wasn\u2019t entitled to know they had a kid and wasn\u2019t entitled to develop any relationship with that child. My best guess is that barring any abuse or safety concerns, some type of visitation schedule would have been set up that was geared towards establishing a relationship that could be built upon once bio dad was released. Again, your kid is FOUR YEARS OLD. That is plenty young enough to develop a healthy and meaningful relationship with a parent figure. You deprived him of that all on your own. And to try to cast him as the villain now, for acting out upon learning such earth shattering info, and for wanting to meet and see his kid, is very dishonest. Imagine if your roles were reversed, how do you think you\u2019d act and what lengths do you think you\u2019d be willing to go to in order to meet your kid and let them know you hadn\u2019t abandoned them/that you want and love them? I bet you\u2019d be willing to kick in a few doors too. Especially after realizing that someone else was standing in your place. \n\n\nIt is wonderful that your current bf has stepped up and is such a present father figure for your child. And your child deserved to have a present father figure. It is also inexcusable that you took that opportunity away from the bio dad completely, and by the sounds of it never would have told him if you hadn\u2019t been caught and called out. Your bf\u2019s role and your kid\u2019s bio dad\u2019s role are not at all mutually exclusive. You would have just needed to work a little harder to make room and make it work. So I repeat, maybe unpopular opinion, but emphatic YTA.", "Yta, your boyfriend can\u2019t adopt your son if the father doesn\u2019t allow it.

We don't know what he went to prison for or what their relationship was like beforehand and it doesn't sound like he's respecting their boundaries now. But unless she honestly thinks he's dangerous or a harmful presence for their child, she's doing them both a disservice by putting up a wall.\n\nAnd if her son grows up and wants a relationship with his bio dad and then finds out she purposely kept that from him, it will irreparably damage their relationship.

I can no longer say that my mother loved me unconditionally knowing that she told the man who makes up half of my DNA that he could be in my life over her dead body. She altered the course of our three lives with that selfish choice and has to face none of my emotional toil now. My father, his side of my family and her friends are being kind enough to not speak too ill of the dead but I would love to have a strong word with her and ask why she got to have two parents and live a solidly middle class lifestyle while I got to be her emotional support child through every one of her unstable ups and downs.", "NTA, call the cops about the parolee trying to force his way into your house.

Do some reading specific to your country/state. \n\nYou can also go through mediation and have the terms decided upon during mediation signed off on by a judge.  Same stipulations as mentioned above.  Sometimes mediation can be cheaper and can feel less embattled. \n\nAfter he is on the birth certificate do NOT interfere in them developing a relationship.  But do NOT allow yourself to trampled on or taken advantage of or abused or anything else to facilitate the relationship.  If he wants a relationship with his child, you absolutely need to allow it.

But.He.Should.Have.Been.Told.\n\nEdit: The violent past etc, good person, bad person, none of it is relevant to this specific circumstance. She didn't have issues with any of that when she was making a baby with him. None of his past meant he was going to be a bad parent but he was straight up robbed of the chance. The law doesn't rescind you of parental rights for going to jail.", "And you don't hide the fact that you have someone's kid they don't even know about. ESH. Bio dad isn't justified in his actions, but his anger and frustration is understandable. Op hid the fact that he had a kid from him for 4 years, and didn't think there was anything wrong with that", "You know there\u2019s phone calls and other ways. Can\u2019t even attempt to do anything since you don\u2019t know.", "Nah, I'm pretty certain it's the whole not knowing of his kid's existence thing.", "Nah, but thanks for checking.", "OP was 22 and Ex was 26. Not 14 and 18", "But we don\u2019t know the circumstances of why he got violent, and we don\u2019t know the circumstances of their relationship either. And considering how he reacted when she blocked him from entering her home unannounced to wake the kid up when the 4 year old doesn\u2019t know him is wrong. Both can be correct good sir.\n\nAnd what exactly would he do as a father while in prison? She was with a new man and was raising her son with him. Do you think it\u2019s good for a child to be exposed things like this this young? That\u2019s the issue at hand.\n\nShe could have told him sure, and that would have been a morally better decision, but I can\u2019t call her an asshole either considering how after years in prison he gets violent, showing he hasn\u2019t changed. What happens when the kid does something to piss him off? Will he be able to hold himself back? I\u2019m sorry, but if I was in her position I would t want to risk it."]}
