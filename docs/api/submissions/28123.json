Imagine that I'm trying to overtake your boyfriend on the right while the guy in front of him is moving lanes to get out of his way, by slowing and moving to the right.  \n\nIt's not about being inconsiderate, it's about road safety. Secondly, your bf is opening himself to serious road rage. Do you want to be in the car when that happens? Maybe someone shoots at you or something? \n\nBut, for you personally...this will be all of your disagreements. My guess is that it's about control. He's someone that sees doing what you say as being controlled by you. And that can't ever happen.", "NTA - the left-lane hogging and the interruptions with a condescending/combative tone all come from the same ego-driven place. \n\nAs you pointed out, making mistakes and behaving badly sometimes is very human - but how one reacts to getting feedback about that is hugely important.

They as much as said that small acts of kindnesses, that would have cost them nothing aren't worth the effort. To me, that says a lot about their character and would be a deal breaker. Had they not been aware of that concept, and moved over after you pointed it out even if they did it while grumbling that would have been a different story for me.\n\n (Granted, this is a pet peeve for me because it is really inconsiderate and or a really clueless driver who holds up a line of traffic behind them. Plus, some people who want to go faster and are held up by your partner, get very frustrated and then drive more dangerously in order to get past, which is an additional reason to move over.)\n\nAn equally important issue here is that they decided that this was a sword to die on, and seemed that they were much more interested in being right, while continuing to be inconsiderate.

The issue isn't about his driving, (which by the way, was a ticketable offense in many places), it was about a major character flaw. Your bf does not have a deep enough emotional IQ to be able to reflect and consider, or learn and grow when faced with things like this.  He's trying to say it's about control, but it is NOT. He created a communication problem when you asked your question and HE put *his own interpretation* on the 'reasoning' behind your question. Instead of taking it at face value or questioning your reasons, *he decided* this was all about control, and then HE DUG HIS HEELS IN.  His reaction then, coupled with his inability (or refusal) to peel away the layers and learn from this, are the Flags you are seeing.", "NTA, in my state cops have started giving drivers tickets for doing the exact thing your ex-partner did.", "NTA.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can even be ticketed for that behavior. There are reasons why there are road signs that say \"Keep right except to pass\". It's a matter of road safety.\n\nYou're completely right in that it's not about the driving, but how the driving reveals a core character trait of his. His desire to be without fault is something that would extend to anything that might cause you harm in the future too, whether physical or emotional. He's simply not compatible with the character traits you're looking for in a long term partner.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, don't feel bad that your asking them to drive home precipitated all of this. This is a character trait that would have revealed itself eventually. You've only been dating for 4 months. I'm sure you've seen signs of it before but they were likely small and more easily ignored than this latest incident. If you hadn't had him drive that night, it would have been something else over the next few months as he got more comfortable letting his true self out.", "NTA.
