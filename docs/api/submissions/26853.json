Your child is unborn, and this name is not theirs. You could easily choose something else and avoid your sister's feelings on this singular name. If you take it, reasonable or not, it will cause tension and hurt feelings. That negativity could spill onto the baby, and she doesn't deserve that just so you can get what you want and win over your sister.\n\nI chose a baby name at 15 that I KNEW would be my daughter's name if I ever had kids.

It's nice when you're a kid when you have a name that you can play with like that.  \n\n\nIf the name has connections, though, it's wise to check with the rest of the family.  My grandfather was Julius, and my aunt, his oldest daughter, named her son after him. But my cousin Julius died of cancer in his twenties, just after I met my ex-husband.  So when I had my second child and wanted to name him after my beloved grandfather and cousin, I asked my aunt if that was something she was okay with.  (Had she not been, he would have been something like Michael Julius Lastname and called Michael/Mike.) But she was good with it, and passed on a lot of stuff with Julius's name on it to my son for that phase when they want their name on everything.  \n\nI'd be REALLY careful with the name of a stillborn child or one who died young, because that's something that people tend to be much more sensitive about.

I've always wanted to give my future daughter my mother's middle name for her middle name. My mother got hers from an aunt's middle name. That aunt was named after her grandmother. \n\nI had an ex friend who we had a big falling out and she ended up marrying my cousin. She was literally my friend since elementary school and even back then I'd said I wanted to have a little girl and name her after my mother.  They had a little girl right away and they were being secretive about the name they were going to give her but it had the same first initial as the name I wanted. She actually approached me at one point and I think she expected me to be upset but my take way I don't like, you I don't spend any time with you, our kids will never meet outside extended family get togethers, if I do have a daughter in the future I will 100% still use that name whether you name your child that or not. And if anybody gives me a hard time I'll point out that I named her after my mother. Apparently that upset her because she could not STAND the idea of a 2nd cousin having the same name as her daughter and they ended up changing it to another name with the same initials. \n\nSo far I just have one son, but if I do have a girl that is totally going to be her name. I'd even discussed it early on in my relationship with my bf who's family also has a girl name trend he's in line for and we're in agreement that we'll use his family's name for the first and mine for the middle. When we found out we were having a boy is the only time we started discussing boy names. \n\nSo having said that, if you do have a little girl absolutely name her Charlotte!

She's so young, it's surprising she's then thought about baby names (in a sense). Even go so far as admitting your mother suggested it, which should take some of the heat off.
