Every year we spend the holidays with his family. This includes all birthdays for every kid in the family and sometimes even the adults.

SILs husband had just had back surgery about 2 months prior and still is heavily medicated. He has a history of narcotic addiction. At one point or another his meds began to wear off and he, in my opinion, was turning in to a complete dick. To a point where I told my kids to stay far away from him. Well, my son (6) ran by him laughing because all the kids were playing tag and BIL purposely put his foot out. My son lands on his stomach, looking back at BIL and then runs off to hide (he does whenever he is embarrassed). BIL then says \"quit running\" (we were literally outside) and then went off on his wife for \"allowing the kids to bump in to him\" (they did NOT bump in to him at all- he was trying to justify his actions). It caused a scene because I went off. My husband didn't see it. If he did, it would have led to bigger problems. But before leaving I made a point to say we absolutely would never attend another function if that low life was there, knowing full well he would be at every function. \n\nAnyways, we were just invited to another kids birthday party and I immediately asked \"is what's his face going to be there?\" We were told yes, so I said \"looks like we won't be then\". I'm being told I'm being ridiculously childish and alienating the kids from them over a \"miscommunication\" when it \"wasn't a big deal\". However, I'm standing firm. My kids aren't allowed near him and never will be again (at least until they are older and can make the decision themselves). My husband is on my side, but he also has never liked that guy.
