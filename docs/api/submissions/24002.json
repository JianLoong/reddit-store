Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\n\nAt some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.\n\nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.\n\nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\n\nBallast!\n\nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.\n\nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .\n\nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\n\nNow you and your DH get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder.\n\nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!\n\nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched.

It's about your mother telling outright lies, knowing how it would hurt everyone.***  **This is about your mother trying to control you.**  She's trying to distract away from the real issue here, which is her behavior, by blaming you for not answering a phone because you didn't want to.\n\nCheck out r/raisedbynarcissists, for more people with parents who do this kind of escalation.  Check out r/MILFH for more help about setting boundaries with mothers/mils who want control over your child.", "Not at all.  Your mom sounds like a royal pain in the rear trying to control you.  It's what a lot of moms/MIL's do, they think they know better.  Just hold your baby shower and not invite her, she's not doing much to get any favors from you, NTAH.", "NTA!\n\nYou need to get your sister and any other sane family member in your corner NOW!\n\nYour mother is the only major AH in the star of her own story.\n\nPS - good luck!", "Absolutely NTA. Uninvite your mom from the shower, meeting your kid, and your life.", "NTA.  I'm 53 and I only email with my mother.  I like to be able to just hit delete.  Something you may want to consider.", "NTA\n\nThough I would have been tempted to go with the hospital thing by saying that mom was putting me under so much stress that it caused an ER visit.\n\nI don't think your mom is panicking. I think this is just another way to get to you.\n\nYou need to put your mom on a contact diet. Like a limit of one text per day. No other texts will be answered. And a phone call once a week.", "NTA. Your mom lied to them - that\u2019s what they should be mad at.", "Obviously not . Overreacting drama is the true AH here", "NTA.... protect your baby at all costs. There is something more going on with your mom, I know - pretty much the same thing is happening to me. It's almost like she doesn't know how to function without drama, without having all attention on her, or playing the martyr. The best thing you can do is S-E-T boundaries now. She is your mom, but you have your own family now too ---  only allow those who add to your life into your life. You might struggle with empathy/guilt, but it does get easier over time. You'll be thankful you have a backbone and not a wishbone. :)", "NTA it\u2019s insane everyone got into such a panic simply from her words without attempting to contact you from the start since it\u2019s sounds like she\u2019s often over dramatic. Keep setting those boundaries and perhaps let the relatives your mum talks to know not to listen to anything she says about you and explain the boundaries your trying to enforce.", "NTA\n\nYour mother knew **exactly what she was doing** when she lied. She knew it was a lie too, because she had no evidence to suggest you were in the hospital. She did it as a means of attack to get her way, because everyone else is probably used to placating her to keep the peace. She knows they'll support her simply because they're used to it, not because they agree.\n\nMake a public notice that you are simply wanting peace and quiet this late in your pregnancy, and have chosen not to deal with your mothers antics. Make it known that you aren't in the hospital, you aren't making this decision as a snap decision, and that it is a firm one. Make it known that the mute and block button functions for all individuals equally, and that you would appreciate it that they bear with this boundary as a family. Make sure they know that they any personal updates will not come to them by way of your mother and she is officially out of that particular loop until further notice.", "You are nta for having boundaries.", "NTA. Your mother was told to back off, she didn't so you gave her consequences of her actions.  She didn't like it and made up a lie so she could get attention.  Grey rock, LC, firm boundaries.", "NTA.  See how your Mom manipulated that? a new qeweapon in her arsenal. \nWhen she could not reach you, she made up an emergency to mobilize other people to get to you.   Very tricky.  She created the panic, not you, but you are the only one not playing her game.\n\nYou want a lunch, not a baby shower. ( a baby shower is when community supports a new mother with things need). That's ok, you don't have to have a shower if you don't want or need it. Guess mom  isn't invited.", "When I worked with survivors of domestic violence, I often heard \"but they are great sometimes!\"  I would point out that yes, everyone is great when they are getting their way and everything is going smoothly.  It is when things are challenging that our true character shows.\n\nNTA, block your mom, your family, and enjoy your peace.", "\nThey should be mad at your mother for panicking everyone for no reason, and lying. Instead it\u2019s your fault for not answering the phone? C\u2019mon now. \nNTA", "No don't send a message to the mother.   She wants OP to break her silence and make contact.  Then OP is back at square one.", "Remember,  you did not cause the mass hysteria, she did! I raised my daughter like this, I am your mother but I am not always right and you will not always agree with me or even like me and that's okay because I will feel the same way about you at times too. I cut my mom out of my life for awhile until she could get her bossy ass self in line and it was great. :D", "No, don't spread rumours or jokes about early onset dementia.  It isn't funny  and it would make you the AH.", "Six words. Just six.", "YES! And it worked!", "Unless she's always been this controlling freak way! Damn I'm not nice, mother or not I'd tell her to back the hell off!", "Time to go NC with the crazy woman. Lying to your relatives should be the last straw.

Tell your sister that you didn't do or cause anything, your mother LIED to multiple people to get attention. \n\nSend your sister the boat rocking essay:  (https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat) and don't have a baby shower with either of them.

Life has been much more blissful without all the criticisms and drama", "It\u2019s such a hard decision, but sometimes it\u2019s the only thing you can do.", "Mom might need a timeout", "NTA", "NTA. Diva parents will make it difficult for you to take back control. You need to find a way to set firmer boundaries. Start saying no and tell the rest of the family to bug off.", "Block her. Do not talk to her. If anyone in your family can\u2019t understand why, stop talking to them. You do not need the stress, and she will only get worse when the baby comes.", "You need to have as little contact with your mom as possible for the rest of your pregnancy and post partum. Stress is horrible for you and the baby. You should be able to enjoy your pregnancy and then the new baby in peace. Well, as much peace as you can get with a newborn. \n\nI would suggest having someone (maybe your husband?) send a text to the family saying you need your space for the good of you and your baby. Let them know that you will be limiting contact so you can also limit the stress. Have it communicated that if something happens, they will be informed. Until then, they need to respect that you need some space and some peace. \n\nYou've got this. \n\nHow is having tea for a couple hours in a chair any better than sitting in a chair for hours during a \"typical\" baby shower? \n\nAgain, you've got this.

Make it clear to your family that your mother has obsessive mental health issues and not to take anything she says seriously then keep your mother in silent or better yet block her.
