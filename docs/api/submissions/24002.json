So everyone is yelling at you to make it right.\n\nMany hugs.", "I didn't realise that my dads relationship with my sister was balanced, reasonable and that they had many good times together. My sister didn't realise how bad my relationship was with our dad, nothing I did was ever good enough, he was a miserable sod with me.  I was the one run ragged doing things for him, to the point where it made me ill.  The penny dropped for both of us at his funeral when people were sharing stories.   Set your mother straight, don't let her get away with any of it, and there's a chance you can build a good relationship for the future.   I'm sure that if I had called my dad out on his crap life would have been better for everyone.  Short term pain, long term gain.  Good luck.", "OP you sound somewhat aware that you're dealing with narcissistic (mom) & goldenchild/possibly narcissistic sister but you are struggling with how to respond.  My best advice is to go nc/lc with all narcissists, enablers and flying monkeys...they will be easy to identify since they out themselves the minute you speak to them.  \n\nI also suggest therapy for yourself.  You've been \"conditioned\" by your narc mother not to defy her,  that's why it's so hard and you get anxious just thinking about saying \"no\" to her.  Narcissistic do a great job screwing up their kids.  Therapy helps to \"deprogram\" you", "I will respectfully disagree in that OP's parent sounds like a textbook narcissistic (covert).  Her behavior with both her daughters is abusive and toxic.  Calling narcissists out on their behavior does nothing but feed into the drama they constantly create.  It will never affect their behavior because true narcs lack the ability of self reflection.  Their egos are the most important thing to protect.  The best way to win the game against a narc is to not play.  That means non-engagement. You don't engage them or their flying monkeys."]}
