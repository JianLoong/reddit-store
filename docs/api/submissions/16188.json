Your Brother (if Im understanding it right) never had a problem with it within your other family members and his friends... but the moment you came out he attacked.  I am assuming hes still \"ok\" with everyone else he knows that is gay?  I hate to say it this way but if this is the case then something about you specifically being gay irks him.   I remember a while back reading a post here about two siblings being gay and one kept it secret but the other came out and the parents were ok with it but the \"closeted\" sibling was upset because he felt it stole his \"moment\".

The audacity to neglect your well being, then ignore/excuse the abuse, then try to force you to accept your abuser, then blame YOU for the conflict??? I'm disgusted. And again, I am so so sorry.
