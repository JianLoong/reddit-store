If you've spoken to her a few times already, that suggests that she's still not listening and you're not covering your bases with her.

You are concerned that, even with that conversation, she will abandon her kid at your party and hold you liable for whatever happens.

I understand needing a break, most days I\u2019m on my own with all my kids and my husband has had to book off work to make this outing safely possible for our own kids. None of other parents of the additional needs kids have ever just dropped them off and have been very good about supervising their kids on outings and play dates until this. I would never drop my kids off with anyone who isn\u2019t well prepared with their needs and comfortable meeting them.

We\u2019re getting a meal pass for each kid so all the parents would have to do is get a meal (though we have enough cake for all the parents if they attend).
