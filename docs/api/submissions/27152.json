She has been spending a lot of time at my house. I have a dog named Tato and he is a small wiener dog. I had him when I was going through a lot and he has always been there for me. I have never been ashamed to say that I consider him to be my best friend.\n\nMy girlfriend is more of a cat person, and she is not the biggest fan of Tato, but she knows how much he means to me so she learned to accept him.\n\nI had to work yesterday and she asked me to stay at my house to work (she works from home), because her parents had guests over (she lives with her parents). So i of course said yes. \n\nI take the bus to go to work, so when I was walking in my driveway, I saw from the window her KICKING MY LITTLE TEENY TATO IN THE STOMACH. I had never been so furious with everyone, I stormed in the house and screamed at her to get the FUCK out of my house and to never call me or talk to me ever again.\n\nWhen I told my coworker, he told me that I overreacted and acted in a dick way.

What else has she done to poor Tato when you couldn't see it happening? She could have really hurt the lil dog.", "Do you know why she felt compelled to attack him so viciously?  Not that there is ever a justification for that unless the animal attacks first.  I'm thinking a Weiner dog is really only going to be able to bite your ankles.  Your coworker is a dick for calling you one.  I'm glad Tato is better today and hopefully the vet will not find anything broken or other issues.  Glad you got home when you did.  That may not have been the only violence she unleashed in him.  Keep that pup safe.  Glad he has an owner who cares.", "Neighbour kicked my sheltie and ruptured her spleen.

I prefer to be safe just in case.", "You are an amazing pet owner.  Tato is very lucky to have you.", "Thank you. He has always been there for me and I would do absolutely everything for him. He is the only constant \"person\" in my life. I\u2019m actually the lucky one.", "This was so sweet to read. Im sorry about your baby but hope you ditch the human. Im more of a cat person myself but I could and would not ever hurt a living being. I dont even eat meat. Can you update us and let us know hes doing okay after he gets checked out? And maybe provide some pics?"]}
