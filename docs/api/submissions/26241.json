We\u2019ve always slept in the same bed. i never had any issues with sharing a bed. But as of recently ive been questioning on continuing this because of a few creepy things have been happening while he slept. For example it would be things like yelling, standing up and walking around the room then jumping back in bed but last night was the last straw. I was laying in bed around 12am. He has a 6am start time for work, so he\u2019s bedtime is earlier then mine. That being said hes in a deep sleep by the time I get in bed. So at this point ive been in bed for about 15-20 minutes struggling to sleep. When suddenly he sits up and STARES AT ME. IN THE DARK. would u not was ready to run out the house. He continued to stare at me for a minute or two then lays back down. I didn\u2019t sleep well that night. I told him about what happened the next morning and he has no memory of it happening, I asked him if he could sleep on the couch for a few nights so i can get over what happened but he\u2019s calling me dramatic. I tried to explain to him how creepy that night was for me but he isn\u2019t budging and insists on sleeping together\n\nEdit: we have a 8 month old baby whom we also share the room with. Being a breastfeeding mom i find it inconvenient to run up a flight of stairs to get to baby throughout the night. Thats why i insist on him moving downstairs to the couch. Just for a night or two. Nothing permanent. There\u2019s really nothing i can do to help. After researching its not recommended to wake him. And if he refuses treatment. then im pretty much useless in this situation\n\nI would also like to add. Hes a stubborn guy. Hes aware of previous issues with his sleep. I\u2019ve encountered him to get checked out but isn\u2019t budging. But as most stubborn knuckleheads like him hes not easy to persuade. For example he sliced his neck open at work after tripping and falling into a pile of rusty rebar. (Nearly turned himself into a human shish kebab) he just super glued the cut closed and hoped he didn\u2019t get tetanus. Thankfully he was ok but thats how stubborn he is!", "created_utc": 1693900747, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ahy77/aitah_for_asking_my_bf_to_sleep_in_a_separate/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get him help, to a therapist, psychologist, or sleep therapist, or any combination of the 3. Something is stressing him, it sounds like you\u2019re new parents so maybe that\u2019s it. Punishing him for something that was not hurting anybody when he was unconscious is kind of mean, and shows you\u2019re not supportive.
