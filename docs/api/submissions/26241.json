We\u2019ve always slept in the same bed. i never had any issues with sharing a bed. But as of recently ive been questioning on continuing this because of a few creepy things have been happening while he slept. For example it would be things like yelling, standing up and walking around the room then jumping back in bed but last night was the last straw. I was laying in bed around 12am. He has a 6am start time for work, so he\u2019s bedtime is earlier then mine. That being said hes in a deep sleep by the time I get in bed. So at this point ive been in bed for about 15-20 minutes struggling to sleep. When suddenly he sits up and STARES AT ME. IN THE DARK. would u not was ready to run out the house. He continued to stare at me for a minute or two then lays back down. I didn\u2019t sleep well that night. I told him about what happened the next morning and he has no memory of it happening, I asked him if he could sleep on the couch for a few nights so i can get over what happened but he\u2019s calling me dramatic. I tried to explain to him how creepy that night was for me but he isn\u2019t budging and insists on sleeping together\n\nEdit: we have a 8 month old baby whom we also share the room with. Being a breastfeeding mom i find it inconvenient to run up a flight of stairs to get to baby throughout the night. Thats why i insist on him moving downstairs to the couch. Just for a night or two. Nothing permanent. There\u2019s really nothing i can do to help. After researching its not recommended to wake him. And if he refuses treatment. then im pretty much useless in this situation\n\nI would also like to add. Hes a stubborn guy. Hes aware of previous issues with his sleep. I\u2019ve encountered him to get checked out but isn\u2019t budging. But as most stubborn knuckleheads like him hes not easy to persuade. For example he sliced his neck open at work after tripping and falling into a pile of rusty rebar. (Nearly turned himself into a human shish kebab) he just super glued the cut closed and hoped he didn\u2019t get tetanus. Thankfully he was ok but thats how stubborn he is!", "created_utc": 1693900747, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ahy77/aitah_for_asking_my_bf_to_sleep_in_a_separate/", "score": 413, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s terrifying to go do a sleep study (this is said as a 20yr old male who has a bed wetting issue, I know what sleep studies are like.) in the first place, let alone if the one person that is supposed to love you unconditionally is FORCING you to.", "Based on OPs edits, this is not a healthy relationship.\n\nHer partner sounds equally unhinged while he is awake", "[deleted]", "She is very dramatic though.", "If you move to the couch, baby comes with you. Then you're both downstairs.", "Not really, at least I did not mean to be. Just meant to be honest. Calling somebody you love creepy and kicking him out of your bed for literally being harmless is a dramatic reaction to something that would require kindness", "He might even be able to catch up on some sleep further away from OP having to get up and down to feed baby.", "If he won\u2019t get or accept help then he is the one that is putting safety at risk which isn\u2019t fair. It would be one thing if he was open to the idea but he is not and op deserves to feel comfortable when she sleeps", "Speaking from personal experience, I have to be woken from sleep walking in a very specific way or else I don\u2019t actually wake up. Like I\u2019ll wake up for a second but slip right back into it. The only thing that works is if someone makes me take a sip of water. \n\nSo it\u2019s not harmful to try and wake me up, it just becomes confusing because it won\u2019t work but I\u2019ll swear up and down to you that I\u2019m awake when I\u2019m not because I was actually awake for a second.", "But also might explain some of the sleep problems\u2026 very interesting piece of information to leave out until the end.", "Yall are so overdramatic lmao", "A dingo ate my baybay!", "Yeah, I'm a sleepwalker \\*and\\* get night terrors. I've put in the work to control it and put in necessary safeguards. Also ... my wife has gotten really good at safely waking me up and convincing me that it's a dream but I 100% would not blame her for wanting to sleep separately after being woken up by my shrieking. \n\nHe's not in control of his actions while he's sleeping, but he sure is in control of what he does when he's awake and shrugging his shoulders and saying 'deal with it' when his spouse expresses concern is a terrible response.", "From what I'm hearing yeah..... didn't realise that there's so many things involved bloody hell. Well I've been educated quite scary tbh and sleep strength is frightening sounding. I wonder what the worst case has ever been ?.", "This is why they won\u2019t let you join the navy if you sleepwalk. You could walk off the ship and get lost at sea. I remember lots of people who didn\u2019t know they were sleepwalkers getting kicked out of boot camp. As a matter of fact, one of the primary things they do in navy boot camp is deprive a person of sleep. If they\u2019re going to be a sleepwalker ever, it almost always comes out there.", "Haha, sorry, I'll check it out, but saying I should've read a random story before commenting on something (a story I didn't even know existed) is a bit much. Not to speak of yhe fact that any story might just be anecdotal evidence of what *might* happen, instead of proof of what is likely to happen.", "The last part about injury not necessarily coming from violence, I agree with. However, the reason I said anecdotes alone aren't enough evidence is because a slap in the face hardly entails danger, and I'd *guess* most people don't even do that.", "I have seen many ppl forgetting to add these kind of details in their posts just because it's natural to them and slips their mind. \n\nMany posts take a turn after an edit after ops realizing they forgot that detail etc etc. \n\nIt's a pity that reddit doesn't send a notif that the post was edited so you can edit your answer if need be.\n\nAs for the super glue etc trust me i have seen a lot of stubborn idiots like him so for me it's not that unbelievable. Some ppl, actually mostly men, will brush things like that off so as not to show as weak. It's stupid", "I totally understand and I understand the pressure OP must be under never getting a resting sleep or enough sleep. She did not force him to do a sleep study, she asked he talks to a doctor, who says sleep study is the doctor's first solution? She also asked he sleeps on the couch (so in another room, I assume there is no second bedroom). It seems very reasonable to me and far from forcing him to do anything terrifying. \nWhy is it ok for him to force her to wake up and get a fright during the night?", "Youre right but this comment is so funny, like you listen all these dangerous things and then\n\n>What if he spooks the baby", "It's recommended that babies sleep in the same room as their parents for the first year to reduce the risk of SIDS. So it's not like she did this to him. They had a baby and she's following safe sleep practices.", "What do you suggest she does with the baby that isn\u2019t just hers?", "And he\u2019s the AH for not going to the doctor.", "Are you noticing she doesn't have a lot of respect for him?", "Let the bears pay the bear tax. I pay the homer tax.", "I felt the same when I first learned more about sleep walking. I couldn't tell you what the worst case is, to be fair, I don't think I want to know. Scary shit.", "I have fallen and broken ribs once (docs thought hubby was abusing me lol) also fell on some glass candle holders breaking them and needing stitches.  My husband has had to stop me from going outside barefoot in below zero weather and doing other stupid things.  While I understand she feels nervous but he may also need some protection.  Waking a sleep walker is not dangerous.  I have been to sleep clinics and bot much can be done aside from an alarm mat to sleep on when my husband is on nights or I'm on business trips alone.  Keep in mind though a lot of sleep issues are hereditary, two of my 3 kids have issues as did my father.", "You flew????", "My friends sister did that too when she was little.  Pulled out the crisper and peed in it, that\u2019s crazy, maybe it\u2019s more common than I thought lol.", "Yeah, that's fair, my bad \ud83d\ude05. While I knew it could be dangerous for the sleep walker and individuals they encounter while sleepwalking, I really didn't know it could lead to murder until my psychology professor presented a few different cases. This is the only one I remember.", "Yeah you might be right... It's a big oversight but i can see people forgeting....\n\nI too do not like to use bandaid on every cut but i've never heard about using super glue... it sounds like it would only make it worse", "I agree with Insomnia, OPs man needs to take responsibility for his behavior, whether it's conscious or not. \n\nThat said, I think it's important to recognize how difficult it can be to seek help and a different approach from OP might yield a better result. An \"us against the problem\" approach might make him understand that he's not being attacked for something outside his direct control but asked to do his part and help her keep the family safe.\n\nIt shouldn't be on OP to carry the burden of responsibility regarding his health and proper healthcare, so he needs to start stepping up and dealing with it himself.\n\n\n\n\nDamn, I should take my own advice...", "Nope... but an extra edit she added later was added after my comment. That or at least added but hadn't shown up in my app yet. The part where she mentions him not wanting to go get checked out. \n\nWhich is insanely relevant to this whole thing. Should have been here from the start. That is also probably why my comment went from like 15 upvotes to -1... owell", "My ex of 6 years used to sleep talk and kick and had some sleepwalking experiences when he was really little but I never saw those... what I did experience for myself was in the middle of the night one night his hand coming around me like he was going to cuddle, his hand then finding my throat, and then pushing down choking me. He wasn't an extreme case. He never did more than talk and kick after that. Had I been a baby, he could have killed me.", "OP is a new mom and breastfeeding. She needs rest and to care for the baby. Her boyfriend is making a mountain out of a molehill by refusing a simple thing like a doctor appointment and expecting OP to deal with the consequences of his health issue. \nAnd if he scares her, it is what it is, not her fault either. He should find a solution. So far, he only rejected hers.", "It\u2019s very obvious. I don\u2019t even think she cares about his health", "Thank you. I didn\u2019t even know it was something they looked into further.", "When I was doing a project and was working on a hospital i saw so many stupid ppl in ER. From glues to just ignoring stuff on their bodies to having severe coughing for over a month that was pneumonia \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 to ppl ignoring the doctors when they were saying they need rest from work because they were on the verge of a total burnout and then coming 2 weeks later where they almost collapsed... \n\nPpl can be so stupid sometimes \ud83d\ude44", "The edit was made hours before your comment, but if your phone really didn't show it of course it makes more sense what you thought. Still a bit harsh given she never said she didn't care. But I agree, should have been there from the start, to stop the usual assumptions.", "I've seen comments older than yours that mentioned the context, but there are a few people who say they didn't see the edit even after it was made, so maybe there was some technical issue for some users. \n\nStill, a bit harsh to accuse her of ignoring the symptoms when she didn't say anything about it all and even mentioned the guy called her dramatic, indicating that he is the one not finding it a serious issue.", "Yep, that's my thought too. Thats what I mean about just moving the crib and sleeping elsewhere. She makes it sound like the crib is where it is and nothing can be done lol", "I wouldn't add people refusing to stop going into work because they were in the verge of burnout on the list of stupid actions. \nA lot of people live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to just take a break from work.", "No it's not harsh. Her wanting to ban her boyfriend from his own bed because he clearly has a sleep issue and presumably sleep walks is harsh. It's as much his bed, as it is hers so why does she have the right to just kick him out of it? \n\nI get that she's a new mom and still breastfeeding and that's super stressful on its own but still doesn't give her the right to kick him out of his bed. \n\nOftentimes symptoms like sleepwalking and other sleep disorders get worsened by stress. Being the only one working atm and having a newborn is pretty stressful and likely worsened his sleep disorder. So kicking him out of bed for what she proposed like 2 or 3 nights surely isn't helping.\n\nI'm not excusing his behaviour of not seeking help and clearly being pretty reckless when it comes to his own health. But this seems like an issue that's way deeper than what OP described.\nAlso why did she not add that this has been a recurring issue with him refusing medical help right from the start?", "[Dear 8 pound 6 ounce, new born omnipotent baby Jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY5VNDvea1M)", "Oh a sweet? Jesus baby!", "Oh, sweet baby Jesus!", "Ya, there's a lot of things they could do instead of just making him sleep on the couch for something he can't control", "Well, doctor advised 2 days off. Here having a doctor's note you take sick leave so it's still paid (!!). \n\nThe person I saw their case had come, was advised to take just 2 or 3 days off, didn't follow the instructions and then came 2 weeks later and was forced to take 10 days off (3 or 4 which she spend in the hospital). \n\nSo yeah, it was stupid decision", "I take it you don't have kids. Children need specific conditions of light and quiet to fall asleep. Also, it's not just the crib that would have to be moved, it would be the changing station plus whatever items she uses while breastfeeding. \n\nWhy is it better to inconvenience two people (OP and the baby) to accommodate her husband who won't take steps to get his sleep condition under control? \n\nSure he could be safe but he could also jump straight out the window or pick up and drop the baby while sleepwalking. Another poster talks about putting a diaper on a pillow and almost putting the pillow over his baby while sleeping. We just don't know how serious it could get. If it could be dangerous, why take the chance?", "Essential is the word you need here, not quintessential.", "Fair, but he could at least have an air mattress or something instead of just sleeping on the couch, but idk I don't have kids I'm just giving my opinion"]}
