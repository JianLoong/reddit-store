(UPDATE)", "selftext": "[Link to the original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104f5ga/aita_for_refusing_to_be_a_bridesmaid_months/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nThank you for all the comments and pov\u2019s in the last post, I want to clarify that although the bride and I are not family, I\u2019ve always been closer with her than with my cousin. \n\nI wanted to give an update on how everything turned out since we had \u201cuntil today\u201d to pay the $500. \n\nYesterday she sent a message to the weeding group chat saying that she would be changing bridesmaid and calling off the bachelorette party since only ONE (out of 16 people assisting the bachelorette party) and ONE (out of four) bridesmaids had paid. (Two, and myself bailed for the pricing.)\n\nShe asked me again, saying that the dresses were actually $35, but she was running out of funds for the bachelorette and decided that was the \u201cbest\u201d way to pay for it. \n\nThe plans changed, we pay the $35 PERSONALLY to the seller, and accessories are optional and out choice. \nI advised her to give out refunds to the people who paid because it isn\u2019t right to use other people\u2019s money like that. And she did. \n\nAt this point i am only going as a bridesmaid for support, and even though I hate to say it I felt bad that she ended up by herself. So I agreed. \n\nHer guests are starting to cancel, since she also tried to charge them in advance for food and drinks, I\u2019m currently trying t help her do things right and accept that she needs to accommodate according to her budget.\n\nAnd yes, we\u2019re on good terms I think, trying to be a good friend rn.\n\nAgain, thank you all.", "created_utc": 1673573370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ah8ut/aita_for_refusing_to_be_a_bridesmaid_months/", "score": 637, "replies": ["Your cousin tried turning her wedding into a gofundme and it backfired.

I\u2019d even bring my own popcorn.", "\u201cHer guests are starting to cancel, since she also tried to charge them in advance for food and drinks\u201d Yeah if I am paying for my food and drinks I\u2019ll pick the restaurant wtf.", "She really doesn't deserve your help on this. She tried to manipulate and lie flat out to get her wedding paid for.\n\n\nBy not only her bridal party but guests as well. If having a wedding is this much of a struggle where you need to lie. It's not ok. She should have canceled the wedding when she realized it was more than she could afford.\n\n\nThere is some people that will never get past how she behaved.", "This is straight up bridezilla behavior, I hope she comes to her senses before she ruins the whole event", "Wedding seems like a shitshow \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "That's awesomeness! I'm glad she's willing to correct her errors.", "You're a good person. The bride is delusional.", "She asked them to pay for the plate, it was like $15 per plate i think", "I know a couple who set up a gofundme for their wedding, saying to donate instead of gifts. This was also in order to attend. Needless to say not many attended.", "She would still charge you.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She can afford a wedding, just not the one she was planning. She was going over 30k USD in budget when she can only spend about 15k\n\nSo not only was she gonna take money from other people, but she was also going to take a huge loan. When she doesn\u2019t even have a car, or a house for herself. Which should\u2019ve been a priority.", "She wasn\u2019t so willing at first, but me & my family (we are the groom\u2019s family) convinced her to do this, because it was all starting to fall apart. No one wants to pay to go to a wedding, they are \u201cguests\u201d for a reason.", "I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say a good person, yes, I feel bad for her and im her friend, but it\u2019s mostly so other people don\u2019t get scammed.", "If no gift is expected, then this is more acceptable", "That's even worse. Wow. She is irresponsible in the extreme.", "Hahaha ur funny to think she didn\u2019t expect a gift.", "Do you have the option of still not being a bridesmaid? I'd be rethinking even attending this thing.", "Eh, glad she came around. Some of the best people go bat shit crazy over the wedding.  The stress, the expectation, the family demands, the financial toll. I'm normally someone who thinks that how people deal in difficult situations says a lot about who they are but I've excluded weddings from that as I've gotten older. \n\n\n\nFor whatever reason people have made weddings into an event designed to destroy the sanity of the people involved. I don't know that I forgive the wedding 'zillas but I  understand that it's not always about someone's character.  Some people just have a psychotic break from the insanity of wedding planning. \n\n\n\nGot married in an electrical contractors office by two literal clowns with my mom as a witness. No stress,no bullshit and they made us balloon flowers. Best fucking wedding ever. \n\n\nI'm glad your friend is finding some of her sanity.", "I really hope we get an update after the wedding happens. Though maybe she will come to her senses and just cancel the whole thing. It's definitely not going to be the day she envisioned.", "Charging people for a wedding?", "Oh a nice update! I\u2019m glad you were able to repair things and it\u2019s good of you to be willing to jump back in to help. Weddings can bring out the crazy in people. I can still remember my best friend berating me and my mother (who had cooked all the food) because she decided to make her own multi tier wedding  cake with no baking experience the day before the wedding and surprise! it wasn\u2019t going well. I forgave her.", "You are a good person but she is not, who charges their guests for food and drink? Couldn't she have waited and saved up a bit?", "So, they basically couldn't afford their own wedding and tried to charge everyone on food and drinks and dresses etc? Did they really think it was a great idea and the guests would be fine with it? NTA", "Dude i can see a divorce in the future. This bridezilla is cray cray.\n\nShe's clearly not responsible at all. Honestly you should do your cousin a favor and ask him if this is really who he wants to spend the rest of his life with.", "Good lord. This woman is going to end up with no friends.", "It's nice you were able to talk her down, people get so crazy over weddings. When I got married we didn't have much money - I borrowed my friend's  wedding dress and the bridesmaids dresses were off the clearance rack - everyone was wearing their own accessories including shoes. And here I am almost 50 years later still married to the same guy.", "Legit feels like the guests would get seated and the bride would march up to the front and say \"Thank you so much for attending! Now who's prepared to pay $50 to upgrade to the premium package where you get to stay and watch us take our vows? For an extra $250 I'll promise to throw the bouquet in your direction!\"", "A show of shit... if you will.... \n\n\nI'll see myself out \ud83e\udd23", "Exactly, I\u2019ve always wanted a private wedding, literally just me, the judge, and the groom, and then mayyyybe a small reception with close/core family in our own yard. (Currently just living with my partner)", "Sadly, everyone\u2019s thinking so too. \nEven my bf bailed on the wedding bc he said he\u2019d rather earn money at work rather than losing it over there.", "Yup", "Ha ha ha ha ha", "Do you think she will take PayPal?", "She should cancel and take the loss because this is NOT gonna be the day she wants", "Honestly now it\u2019s more like a favor, most of the wedding party has bailed, so I agreed to do, now she\u2019s in the process of replacing the other 3 bridesmaids (who quit) and yes, the one who paid also pulled out last minute", "Ok, I'm amused by the 'weeding' party. It may have been a typo, but it's an accurate one!", "Wow. You're a nice person.", "So most weddings now a day I think this is the norm regardless of culture you don\u2019t give physical gifts you give money in an envelope, which in turn \u201cpays for your plate\u201d if she\u2019s that hard up on cash she should have had a stag and doe to raise some money.", "What is the popage fee these days?", "Ha! Like a corking fee? That\u2019s great \ud83d\ude06\ud83c\udf7f", "Being a bridesmaid is always a favor", "She's charging her wedding guests?!", "Yeah, you're friend is lucky to have you OP", "I am trying to figure out how she was going to pass off a thirty five dollar dress as a five hundred dollar one.", "She didn\u2019t claim the dress was $500. She said the dress was $100.", "She charged 100 for the 35 dress - 500 was the total price when everything else she wanted was tallied up.", "Sticking this out to help save other people from getting scammed, since you already set hard boundaries and aren't being a doormat, indicates a good person.", "This is what my parents did. The meal and seating was worked out to cost about $50 per-person. They were super poor so absolutely could not afford a wedding without people paying for themselves. They said that people paying for their presence at the wedding was all the gifts they needed. They sent out invites super early to plan everything so they knew who would come and who wouldn't. It was a great way of knowing who actually wanted to be there and who didn't. \n\nIt also led to my parents 18 years later finding a reply letter with $50 in it from one of their grandparents who died before the wedding. A lot of tears were had over that letter.", "Well typically the couple has a gift registry so gifts mean the couple dont have to spend money on xyz.\n\nWedding gifts can easily be $50+ so charging per plate is stupid and shooting herself in the foot.", "Certainly not the norm in my culture.", "I\u2019m starting to realize I may be wrong and this is like maybe a European thing ?? I\u2019ve never been to a wedding where there was a \u201cgift registry\u201d you put money in an envelope who the fuck wants a toaster or a blender ?", "What culture are you that you still give physical gifts for a wedding ?", "Whoever needs a toaster or a blender, no? If they have a gift registry it's because they want those things... \nI'm European and gift registries are relatively normal, although probably less common now since the couples usually live together and have the stuff they want by the time they're married. Still, most couples will have a website where you can give money to their honeymoon or something like that. Envelopes with cash is a bit tacky... and a lot of work afterwards.", "u/Important-Fondant646,\n\nNot a \u201cEuropean\u201d thing either, in my experience. I have attended weddings where money is given (some Greek, European Asian), but the majority have been gifts.  Not having attended weddings in every country, I dont know if paying for a plate is normal in some European countries.  Mind you, I have attended weddings where there was a wedding gift registry and weddings where there wasnt a wedding gift registry.", "More to the point, what culture are you from that you DON'T?????? People on here from all over (I'm in the UK) are telling you it's normal to still have a registry.", "Every American wedding I\u2019ve ever been to has had a gift registry, regardless of the ethnic background of the bride and groom. Gift registries are great for people who may not have $100 or $50 to give but still want to give something from the registry that the couple actually wants/needs, so they chose the $5 salt and pepper shakers that the couple already picked out for themselves and everybody\u2019s happy.", "I\u2019m in Ireland and got married in 2020. Most people gave us money but we still got a couple of gifts from older relatives.", "Australia (anglo descent).\n\nHeck, I told my guests that I didn't care about gifts at all, and still got multiple sheet sets, saucepans, cutlery, platters, and a barbecue.", "Red envelopes with (LOTS of) cash are expected in Vietnamese (and Viet-American, Viet-whatever) weddings. The bride and groom are supposed to visit each table at the reception to collect them. Tons of other Asian weddings have this custom.", "In Italian culture if you give a gift you\u2019re tacky and that\u2019s a white people thing to do. The custom is an envelope with cash.", "I\u2019m Italian , my sister married Iraqi and I\u2019ve been to Lebanese weddings as well. \n\nMoney in envelope, you don\u2019t show up with a physical gift. The bride has a shower for gifts", "(Just chiming it to say it\u2019s not tacky in many cultures.)", "Can your cousin talk some sense into her? They are going to start their married life in serious debt.", "If you're getting married.. then the bride and groom should pay for everything. I'm in the UK and we pay for the bridesmaid dresses...the suits worn by the best man and the ushers. I've never ever known a bridesmaid pay...must just be a British thing.", "Wow you are a far Far better friend that she in Any way deserves.", "I'm in the UK too and know as the norm for bridesmaids to pay for their own dresses.\n\nI paid for a braidsmaid dress only for them to cancel the wedding \ud83d\ude44", "You do realize that what she was doing is an actual crime. It is, literally, fraud. Maybe the police wouldn't care because she's only defrauding her bridesmaids, but I think you might be better off distancing yourself before you get wrapped up in something that might be criminal too.", "Some people really just want a wedding, marriage be damned. Good luck to everyone around her.", "I imagine she got caught up in the influencer fantasy. She has seen all these women on tv, that image is Everything to, that get others to fund their lifestyles.\n\nIt's totally unrealistic and makes her former friends and loved ones feel used and taken advantage of. \n\nWho has been encouraging her to think like this?\n\nI hope she hasn't burned too many bridges. She will need to show some humility to apologize to some people.", "If she's that strapped for money, she shouldn't be having a wedding", "Cash in hand vibes", "If you can\u2019t afford a wedding you shouldn\u2019t have a wedding. I\u2019m sure you think your parents sound clever or adorable or whatever but this sounds awful.", "Yeah no, people in poverty still get to get married mate. Just like they also should be able to keep their kids, or afford to eat. You don't have to go to a wedding you have to pay for if you don't want to, it's why they sent out to ask who was able to first. But it's selfishness and privilege at it's highest to expect poor people to fork out thousands to get married they could have spent on something else instead, such as food. Not one person in this area complained about this, because this is what poor people do to be able to be able to hold important events together. \n\n\"I think it's awful poor people banded together and all paid for themselves so that two of their friends/family members could get married.\" You sound like a highly unpleasant person to be around. Consider why you think it's ok to tell people who are struggling to just not have a family. Check your privilege.", "I've seen gift registries in England and Ireland at least.  They're getting more popular as technology improves because businesses looooove them so encourage customers to use them.", "You know the term a sinking ship... Although I applaud you on staying behind to help, you\u2019re going to be used as a flotation device to support the brides inflated ego. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with jumping into the water with the others.", "You're a decent person, OP. After the stunt she tried to pull, it's no wonder others bailed. It looked like she bought into the fantasy of the big, fancy wedding, but not being able to pay for it herself, she decided to have others pay for it. No one would think less of you if you bailed too, but the good thing is at least she seems to have gotten a strong dose of reality when everyone pulled out, and come to her senses.", "Getting married and having a wedding are two different things. You can get married at the courthouse you can get married in your backyard you can get married at the park. You can get married and serve cake and punch and not be out more than $200. That's different from having a wedding where you need hundreds or thousands of dollars", "My husband and I spent more money being in my BIL & SIL\u2019s wedding than we did on our own. We eloped in Hawaii and the plane tickets, my dress, the photographer, and officiant coats were still less.", "We had cake and punch in the church fellowship hall like everyone else in 1985. (And butter mints. Every Southern wedding had butter mints!)", "Good to know \ud83d\ude0a. Not in Portugal, Spain or France. In case of a registry, people don't show up with gifts, you buy it on the registry website (like an Amazon wishlist), and it's then deliver to the bride and groom - you can even pay just for a part of a gift, if everything is too expensive. \n\nI'm not sure why you wrote \"it's a white people thing to do\" - italians are Caucasian.", "No one shows up anywhere with physical gifts \ud83d\ude06 Can you imagine? High heels, a tiny purse, cocktail dress, and carrying a set of champagne glasses.", "Yes, of course! I was generalising for Western culture. In Greek (?) weddings you throw money at the bride and groom! (big notes, not coins \ud83d\ude06)", "In some Greek weddings friends of the groom (iirc) come to get the bride and she pretends she cannot come because the shoes do not fit, to get them to stuff her shoe with cash notes.  The bride in OPs situation should have pulled that!"]}
