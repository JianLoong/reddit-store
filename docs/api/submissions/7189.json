(Two, and myself bailed for the pricing.)\n\nShe asked me again, saying that the dresses were actually $35, but she was running out of funds for the bachelorette and decided that was the \u201cbest\u201d way to pay for it. \n\nThe plans changed, we pay the $35 PERSONALLY to the seller, and accessories are optional and out choice. \nI advised her to give out refunds to the people who paid because it isn\u2019t right to use other people\u2019s money like that. And she did. \n\nAt this point i am only going as a bridesmaid for support, and even though I hate to say it I felt bad that she ended up by herself. So I agreed. \n\nHer guests are starting to cancel, since she also tried to charge them in advance for food and drinks, I\u2019m currently trying t help her do things right and accept that she needs to accommodate according to her budget.\n\nAnd yes, we\u2019re on good terms I think, trying to be a good friend rn.\n\nAgain, thank you all.", "created_utc": 1673573370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ah8ut/aita_for_refusing_to_be_a_bridesmaid_months/", "score": 1559, "replies": ["Your cousin tried turning her wedding into a gofundme and it backfired.

I don't know that I forgive the wedding 'zillas but I  understand that it's not always about someone's character.

The meal and seating was worked out to cost about $50 per-person. They were super poor so absolutely could not afford a wedding without people paying for themselves. They said that people paying for their presence at the wedding was all the gifts they needed. They sent out invites super early to plan everything so they knew who would come and who wouldn't. It was a great way of knowing who actually wanted to be there and who didn't. \n\nIt also led to my parents 18 years later finding a reply letter with $50 in it from one of their grandparents who died before the wedding. A lot of tears were had over that letter.", "Well typically the couple has a gift registry so gifts mean the couple dont have to spend money on xyz.\n\nWedding gifts can easily be $50+ so charging per plate is stupid and shooting herself in the foot.", "Certainly not the norm in my culture.", "I\u2019m starting to realize I may be wrong and this is like maybe a European thing ??

If they have a gift registry it's because they want those things... \nI'm European and gift registries are relatively normal, although probably less common now since the couples usually live together and have the stuff they want by the time they're married.

Mind you, I have attended weddings where there was a wedding gift registry and weddings where there wasnt a wedding gift registry.", "More to the point, what culture are you from that you DON'T?????? People on here from all over (I'm in the UK) are telling you it's normal to still have a registry.", "Every American wedding I\u2019ve ever been to has had a gift registry, regardless of the ethnic background of the bride and groom. Gift registries are great for people who may not have $100 or $50 to give but still want to give something from the registry that the couple actually wants/needs, so they chose the $5 salt and pepper shakers that the couple already picked out for themselves and everybody\u2019s happy.", "I\u2019m in Ireland and got married in 2020.

Just like they also should be able to keep their kids, or afford to eat. You don't have to go to a wedding you have to pay for if you don't want to, it's why they sent out to ask who was able to first. But it's selfishness and privilege at it's highest to expect poor people to fork out thousands to get married they could have spent on something else instead, such as food. Not one person in this area complained about this, because this is what poor people do to be able to be able to hold important events together. \n\n\"I think it's awful poor people banded together and all paid for themselves so that two of their friends/family members could get married.\" You sound like a highly unpleasant person to be around.

After the stunt she tried to pull, it's no wonder others bailed.

Day before, my buddy reached out to me on whatsapp and asked what I was up to and when I told him I was out buying wedding gift, he called me right away and told me to not buy anything; The time, money and effort I spent on coming to the wedding (Flying from EU to US) was  gift enough.

Also it seems like there are a lot of \u201cinstagram foodies\u201d who have all the fanciest cookware. \n\nMy husband has had multiple co-workers get married within the last year (all mid-30s). Each of them have complained about how hard it is to combine two full households of stuff, and then older relatives are buying them *more* kitchenware items\u2014 rather than giving money. One lady had triplicate toasters.", "Oh dear.", "iykyk - yeah, I'm not in the know.  So I'm going to ask, do they really *have* to get married or can they break up and he can find someone who isn't going to scam relatives and friends out of their money to pay for a party?", "I used to think it was an honor but after the money and work some of my more demanding friends have required I silently hope I never get asked again!", "LOL it's hilarious that people are downvoting comments for relating accurate information about other cultures' traditions.", "They\u2019ve been together for 2 years, and he said she had never done anything like it, they mostly want to get married for carnal reasons:)", "people want to frame it as an honor, otherwise you'd be crazy to go through half of the things self-centered brides demand these days. Their leash is the sense of commitment, fear of disappointing, and the blind faith that one day they'll work just as hard for you as you did for them. However, when people behave this selfishly they usually are \"unavailable\" or \"too busy\" or \"life happens, you know?\" when it is your turn. The truth is that these kind of people turn their friends into props for pictures, it's all about the bleeping pictures and then they drift apart because now that they are married having single friends is risky...", "Is \"white\" how Italians actually describe it, or do they say things like Southern vs Northern or Italian vs Tuscan?", "She inflated costs and LIED TO YOU ALL TO TRY AND PAY FOR HER WEDDING???

I cannot imagine someone inviting people to a wedding and expecting them to pay! Wth! And she sent her wedding party INFLATING the dress cost? She is such a dishonest person!", "Why is she having such a pricey wedding that they can't afford???  I'm appalled she tried to mark up the bridesmaid dresses and other things to make some money to pay for her bachelorette.  No wonder everyone is bailing on her.", "I get if she was tight on funds, but also I\u2019m just baffled by this. In my family, when someone gets married, the bride/bride\u2019s family pays for the bridesmaid dresses. Anyone that\u2019s invited is generally expected to bring a gift (since it\u2019s common courtesy) but it\u2019s also worth noting that I don\u2019t expect my guests to pay for anything at the wedding itself? Especially not the food", "Baaaaaahahahahahahaha she wanted to charge people to attend her wedding??? Good heavens!! Hope she has the day she deserves I guess! NTA", "You never ever ever ever ask guests to pay for their food and drink at a wedding.....!? No wonder everyone is bailing.\n\nThats NOT how it is done, whatever your budget, you invite THAT amount of people accordingly.\n\nIf its a buffet, fine, if its take out from the local Chinese thats fine too, but never ask guests to pay.....", "I always wonder if these brides who can\u2019t afford their weddings are scammed into thinking they have to based on all the social media depictions of beautiful cakes and stuff and they don\u2019t consider what the people they know are like. \nI hate to sound classist or whatever but you have to know your age group and types of people coming to your wedding. My family and friends are well off (engineers, Lawyers doctors etc) and so am I and my husband. His family and friends are not. We didn\u2019t expect much from them but I could expect huge payouts from my family for gifts w/o being an A-H. As a bride you have to set expectations or wait until you or your friends have more money. \nFriends who got married young had cheaper bachelorette parties and cheaper gifts. Friends who got married later when were all established got international bachelorette parties and more expensive gifts. It\u2019s just logical \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nThe fact this bride asked an 18 yo in school to be a bridesmaid and pay for all this stuff is just silly! I definitely didn\u2019t have $500 to my name then unless my parents wanted to be generous.", "I'd bet good money that you will have to make one or more \"emergency\" loans or payments at this wedding. Is she going to charge the groom for sex on the honeymoon?", "Is this bride inept??? I have never heard of anyone requesting guests to pay for their plate. How tacky and rude! She needs a reality check.", "INFO: how old is this bride????", "You should tell the bride they shouldn't be having a wedding if their financial situation can't handle it.", "why throw a wedding that you can't afford. Ultimately people will end up remembering the negatives of the situation instead of the fun party (if) it could be.", "You have the wedding you can afford! There is no shame in having a small wedding. Charging wedding party members and guests is just tacky. My eldest son got married last summer.  25 guests.  No attendants (brides grandparents were their witnesses). Dinner out at a restaurant. Then in the evening, they rented a local pub for their friends to come have a pint and finger foods. Everyone was very happy, and they stayed within budget.", "The bride should pay for the dresses etc. NTA", "It's tacky as hell but not that surprising for someone who would choose pink vans as part of the bridesmaid outfit", "She\u2019s 20", "The groom is 22, but he\u2019s got a high paying job, just not high enough for her\ud83d\udc80", ">She asked me again, saying that the dresses were actually $35, but she was running out of funds for the bachelorette and decided that was the \u201cbest\u201d way to pay for it.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Her guests are starting to cancel, since she also tried to charge them in advance for food and drinks\n\nIf you can't afford your dream wedding you have a handful of options: 1.) have a long engagement so you can save up for everything you want, 2.) adjust your expectations to fit your budget, 3.) just ask someone to lend you the money (you know, by being outright and open about it). Hoodwinking your friends and family into paying for things is not an option you take if you still want to have good relationships with your friends and family after the wedding.", "Just looked it up...seems to be a Canada thing?", "Charging invited guests to attend a party you are throwing for yourself?", "It is literally never acceptable under any circumstance. They're guests; they don't pay a penny.", "I've been to a wedding that was done on an absolute shoestring--the potluck dishes (each with ingredients cards just to be safe) and the free music by the folkie friends of the bride and groom were the wedding gifts.  It was wonderful.", "ooooh this is what i\u2019m tryna do!! an appalachian hick lesbian wedding", "It\u2019s what I get for growing up in the MySpace Top 8 era!", "If you can\u2019t afford to do a wedding and reception go to city hall and get married then have a reception when you\u2019ve saved for it.. or better yet wait save you money and have the wedding you want.

The cash you place on the card for the couple should equal the average cost per plate. No?", "I've had some decent food at weddings.\n\nBut not \"I'd be willing to pay full price for this and not even get to pick what I eat\" levels of decent", "Oh, I think it will be cancelled.  But I don't think the bride will be the one who cancels it.", ">since she also tried to charge them in advance for food and drinks\n\nAhahahaha. I saw that there were disagreements in the last post about whether the bride should be paying costs for the bridesmaids, but I don't think anyone is going to argue that it's customary for guests to pay a plate fee like they're going to a politicians fundraising dinner... One of the whole reasons people use that \"guests are expected to always bring a gift and it should be a minimum of X amount\" is that it's something to help the couple and also make up for the cost of the wedding. I mean, I can see in certain communities where they might do a HS sports team supporting style spaghetti feed and ask people to pay for a plate to gather funds for a house down payment or something. But this, nope.

Don't have a fancy wedding if you can't afford every penny. A courthouse ceremony toasted in water at a local restaurant is still a wedding!\n\nThe co-opting of the word \"wedding\" to mean \"big party\" is also abhorrent.
