The dog stops and thus the lady stops, and the dog takes a shit in the middle of the airport. The lady just ups and walks away, doesn\u2019t clean it up.\n\nAs someone who has stepped in dog shit before, I get pissed. I tell my wife to call someone and I go to confront the lady. I go up to her and ask her, were you going to pick that up? She just ignores me and keeps walking. I get in front of her and tell her you need to go pick up your dogs shit. She just says please leave me alone and goes by me. So I follow her loudly asking her if she was going to pick up her dogs shit? I just repeat this over and over. After a few minutes of this she turns around and says asshole, stop harassing me.  People are looking at us and it\u2019s a minor scene but I maintain my comments. She keeps walking and I keep following. Finally she gets to her gate I guess and takes a seat in the corner. \n\nMy wife texts me that airport staff came to pick up the poop. I just loudly tell that lady she sucks, her dog sucks, it shouldn\u2019t even be here, and warned everyone else that her dog may shit and she won\u2019t do anything about it.

She deserved what you did, because had you and your wife not stepped in, someone trying to travel could\u2019ve stepped in it, ruined their day, tracked it through the airport, and possibly on to their plane\u2026unsanitary and ruins everyone\u2019s day. \nIt\u2019s a shame airport sanitation staff had to clean that up, the owner should have.", "Oh you were totally an AH, but you used your AH powers for good. I applaud this incidence of positive AHollery, and hope you will own it. Maybe not make a habit of it, but definitely stand behind your own AH behavior!", "NTA! You are the hero. Some dog owners are soooo entitled. My estate is full of dog sh\u00d7t and everyday i see owners on their phones 'oblivious' to their dogs defecating everywhere. Good on you, kee up the good fight.", "ESH  The lady's behavior totally sucks for obvious reasons.  OP's only started sucking when it became about 'just wanting to publicly shame her' instead of about problem solving.  \nYeah, your outrage was understandable, but once you knew the mess was cleaned up, it became the time to take a deep breath, sigh about some people, walk away and start focusing on your responsibility to and for your own self.  Giving her more headspace didn't do anyone any good.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are lucky you were not arrested.  Causing a ruckus at an airport is a good way to end on the no fly list.", "YTA. You are supposed to film them. Not stand in front.", "YTA but done beautifully my friend. Sometimes you got to be ta. She was although the much bigger ah. I hate when they dont pick uo their dogs poo on the street let alone in an airport \ud83e\udd22", "YTA, but only in hindsight. I\u2019m sure I would have done the same thing you did in the moment. \n\nYou publicly called out the dog lady, and that part was fine. But then you got in front of the dog lady and continued to point out her wrongness. So in the end, you got yourself all riled up by someone who obviously doesn\u2019t give a sh*t (no pun intended) and it made you look like an AH, too.\n\nWhen confronting AHs, we need to make sure we don\u2019t stoop to their level.", "I mean, technically it's an E-S-H but technically she deserved it...", "Yep YTA.  The correct thing to do was what you told your wife to do.  Make sure someone doesn't step in it and get someone from the airport to deal with it.  You could have gotten arrested.\n\nEdit to add of course the woman was a bigger ass but that's doesn't make OP not one.", "ESH - except the dog.", "Stolen story.", "Pretty sure I've read this exact same story, multiple times over years.", "This", "I agree, the lady absolutely sucks, but that is unhinged \n\nThat\u2019s just begging to get security called on you", "As the wife I would\u2019ve been pissed and anxious that he was going to get himself kicked out of the airport. Like yeah, shitty people are shitty but that doesn\u2019t mean you get to harass them.", "Why not? If he doesn\u2019t do something who will?", "Thank you!", "Nah. This attitude is the reason that shitty people like her move the world unchecked. I would have picked up the shit and handed it to her.", "If not OP then who? Unchecked bad behavior will repeat", "A public place where people don\u2019t expect there to be dog shit on the floor so no one is thinking to look out for it. \n\nWhat if a wheel for someones luggage or a wheelchair goes though it, someone gets it on their shoe. Do you want to be in an enclosed space like an airplane reaking of dog shit? \n\nAssholes like that lady are why dogs get banned from places, she\u2019s ruining that for everyone and creating a smelly health hazard with the poop. \n\nDepending on my mood I would have just yelled \u201cyou forgot to pick up your dogs shit\u201d across the airport while pointing vs using the energy to chase that inconsiderate asshole down.", "So am I allowed to just pop a squat and take a shit right in the middle of the airport ? I mean it\u2019s in public so no one else should mind right ?", "Yeah, we can\u2019t ignore the elephant on the room here-He ABSOLUTELY would not have been this aggressive and chased down a man if they did this\n\nBecause a man could get right back in his face", "Agree, he was in the right untill he started following her and airing his grievances about dogs, dude has anger issues.", "Naw, if you want to be left alone in public don\u2019t leave dog shit on the floor where people can step in it or wheels can go through it. She created a stinky health hazard in a public space. She deserves to be called out on it.", "this is what too much twitter does to a person", "How is she not an asshole?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Surely dog poop is not his one Breaking Point.", "He did absolutely nothing. All he did was yell at a person in the airport. It didn't even result in her cleaning up the mess so he really accomplished nothing other than making himself look crazy in an airport.", "I'd rather not have to witness OP following a woman and yelling at her, let alone flinging poop.\n\nIn a case like this you say something, scold them, then go about your day. Traveling is bad enough - no need to create more drama.", "I\u2019ve seen a bunch of people comment this. I think in reality OP did the best he could. Throwing her dogs poop in her lap could likely get him into trouble.", "Nobody? This lady is an adult, it\u2019s not OPs job to \u201ccorrect\u201d her behavior, he\u2019s a stranger, not her parent. Id like to think that if this is how she conducts herself in general, life will bite her in the ass one day \n\nAlso, I didn\u2019t say that OP was the AH for calling her out at all. I still think that initially yelling at her was good, and I would\u2019ve done the same, but following her to her gate was very excessive. And frankly sounds like an exhausting attitude to have towards life. It\u2019s good to try your best to have a positive influence (ie. Initially calling her out), but otherwise just focus on controlling the controllable", "yes thats exactly what they mean. when nature calls, you gotta answer", "If you're harassing strangers in public to the point they ask you to stop, you are always the asshole. There are a million other ways to handle this situation, and the one chosen is not effective. No further conversation needed.", "Was just thinking that! Following someone and yelling at them is honestly not a sane reaction to pretty much anything and would make me think you\u2019re unhinged and possibly dangerous.", "Yeah it would be disconcerting to watch, and honestly, is risky for OP too -- someone could have complained about him following her, security could have seen the commotion and thought he was a threat, etc. It's not worth escalating IRL when holiday travel is so tense.", "Returning someone\u2019s property won\u2019t get you in trouble \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Well I\u2019d argue that \u201clife biting her in the ass\u201d includes public humiliation. If nobody says anything or does anything, people like this will continue to act poorly. The argument that this lady is an adult and will self-fix is not likely. But you\u2019re right, OP prob took it just a little too far", "If she got scared and embarassed and upset by an adult following her and yelling at her, guess what?  \n\n\nNext time she's got her dog in an airport, it won't be allowed to crap on the floor and have her walk off and leave it.", "I\u2019d agree with that. I\u2019m not arguing that her behavior will self correct, it almost definitely won\u2019t. I\u2019m arguing that fixing her behavior isn\u2019t a stranger at the airport\u2019s responsibility, and that any more than the initial moment of public humiliation isn\u2019t going to actually do anything more to \u201ccorrect\u201d her behavior in my opinion. If she didn\u2019t care after he initially said something I think it\u2019s just overkill to keep harping on it and making a scene. It also makes me think OP might have a little bit of a temper problem if a stranger at the airport can get them this fired up, but that\u2019s totally speculation and I could definitely be wrong", "But you say you had zero plans to get physical with anyone, yet you do think it was possible she could have lashed out at you physically, because you kept harassing her. And honestly, if she HAD, she would've been justified at that point. Not cleaning up after her dog is poor behavior, but loudly, publicly, repeatedly harassing her, following her, making a huge scene - you made yourself look far worse and put yourself in a position where she could've gotten physical with you just because you were escalating the incident to unhinged levels.", "They could if they're pushed to a certain point. And OP sure as hell was trying to push them there.", "I\u2019m a 6\u2019 tall woman, and I\u2019d have done what she did and try to flee from the aggressive weirdo and pray he doesn\u2019t get worse. She was wrong, but everything he did after his first remark is wholly inappropriate.", "ESH"]}
