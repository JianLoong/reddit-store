Arrive at the airport, get through security. We are a few hours early so we are trying to figure out a good spot to grab a drink. My wife and I are chatting and I notice in the background a lady with a dog, maybe 15 pounds. Its on  a leash and not in a carrier (she had one with her). The dog stops and thus the lady stops, and the dog takes a shit in the middle of the airport. The lady just ups and walks away, doesn\u2019t clean it up.\n\nAs someone who has stepped in dog shit before, I get pissed. I tell my wife to call someone and I go to confront the lady. I go up to her and ask her, were you going to pick that up? She just ignores me and keeps walking. I get in front of her and tell her you need to go pick up your dogs shit. She just says please leave me alone and goes by me. So I follow her loudly asking her if she was going to pick up her dogs shit? I just repeat this over and over. After a few minutes of this she turns around and says asshole, stop harassing me.  People are looking at us and it\u2019s a minor scene but I maintain my comments. She keeps walking and I keep following. Finally she gets to her gate I guess and takes a seat in the corner. \n\nMy wife texts me that airport staff came to pick up the poop. I just loudly tell that lady she sucks, her dog sucks, it shouldn\u2019t even be here, and warned everyone else that her dog may shit and she won\u2019t do anything about it. I just wanted to publicly shame her. I leave and go find my wife.

Don't get a dog if you are unwilling to take care of its needs, like taking it on a walk to do it's business before entering an airport/plane.\n\nYou were quite persistent. Don't become someone who does this about any little thing that rubs you wrong. But that being said, if airport service had wanted to talk to this person about the dirty deed, your actions would have made that possible.", "Honestly, NTA. People like her make it harder for disabled people like me to get a service dog. It's enraging.", "NTA but unfortunately us trying to teach people in the world these lessons, doesn\u2019t usually work. I understand your frustration though. I\u2019ve stepped in dog poop a lot around my apt complex even though there are bags and trash cans everywhere. All I can do is pick up my dog\u2019s poop. Well I could pick up all the other dog poops too but that would take forever and be overall ineffective bc it would continue to accumulate over time (I do grab an extra poo sometimes though).", "NTA. You are my hero.\nI wouldn't have dared to do that, but I think it's great that there are people who do it.", "NTA", "You know you were, lol. But SHE definitely was. \n\nWhat the actual heck?!

It's like when I got into a bathroom stall someone just left and see pee all over the seat and will immediately exclaim EW GROSS SOME LADY JUST PEED ON THE SEAT AND WALKED OFF! and then leave the stall..usually with the woman in question not even to the sink yet to wash her hands. I don't point out that it's HER but everyone else in the bathroom KNOWS. I've only ever done that maybe three times, but it's a justified-asshole moment. Same with yours. If you walk a dog and it takes a shit inside, you better have a bag or something to pick it up and you better make sure an employee knows that the area needs to be cleaned asap.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not the dogs fault.

I will die in this hill forever.", "I'm going with NTA - because that lady was most definitely the asshole.

That was really rude of her, and she sounds obnoxious, inconsiderate, and awful, but you didn\u2019t have to make it your personal mission to try to get her to do the right thing.

At that point you were a crazy person following a lady through an airport. To get that upset is too far. You confronted her and when she ignored you that should have been it.", "ESH\u2026 she\u2019s an asshole, but you sound a bit unhinged. Was this really about the dog shit?", "ESH.  Obviously she is an asshole.  But holy cow, you took it to a whole new level.  I would be completely freaked out if I saw you chasing a woman through the airport and then you ended up on my flight.  Yikes.", "ESH\n\nShe was absolutely an AH for not cleaning up after her dog. You and your wife were kind for stopping to ensure it was cleaned up. You cancelled out your act of kindness by chasing after and harassing someone who didn\u2019t want to hear what you had to say. The public humiliation you were looking for would have been achieved by shouting \u201chey lady! Clean up after your dog\u201d very loudly in the terminal and leaving it at that.\n\n>her dog sucks, it shouldn\u2019t even be here\n\nDogs are allowed in most airports. You\u2019re not the dog police.  You\u2019re not the airport police. Seems like your harassment was mostly motivated by some self-righteous belief that dogs shouldn\u2019t be in airports. You\u2019ve been outvoted by pretty much all the major airlines who accept pet fees to transport small dogs in the cabin so it\u2019s time to let it go.", "ESH / YTA \n\nWhilst what she did was bad, you took it upon yourself to escalate the situation. You\u2019re definitely taking out some of your life stress on this idiot because you felt like you were justified. You made a bad situation worse and didn\u2019t achieve anything.", "ESH- she is a huge raging AH for not cleaning up after her dog, especially in an airport- I would have felt the same way as you. \n\nBut, assuming here that you are a man and significantly larger than her, I imagine you came off as super threatening. Just because she is an awful entitled human doesn\u2019t mean she should fear for her safety", "ESH\n\nBut you honestly sound worse. She\u2019s wrong but you sound unhinged", "ESH. She should\u2019ve cleaned up after her dog. But you should\u2019ve never harassed a woman across the airport. Following and screaming at someone is harassment. Your behavior is very troubling. You said your peace and should\u2019ve left it at that. If she was going to clean up after her dog then she would\u2019ve when it occured.", "YTA the airport needs.  Not the one it deserves.", "NTA- but also the AH. You didn\u2019t have to do all that. You could\u2019ve just alerted someone on staff and avoided the scene.

You are not the airport police.  It is not your place to follow people around while berating them.  We live in a society where we assign the duty of enforcing rules like this to professionals.", "ESH - assuming she isn't blind and this isn't a guide dog (which is a fair assumption since guide dogs dont generally toilet indoors) catching her and telling her to pick it up is fine.\n\nContining to harrass her for what sound like a fairly long trip across the airport terminal is not.\n\nFollowing her to the gate to alert the airline staff of her behaviour and unwillingness to ensure her dog doesn't cause a nuisance - fine.\n\nLoudly harassing her again - asshole", "Nta", "NTA\nShe deserved it. It's not ok to just leave dog poo on the street, but even WORSE in a crowded airport. And people are dragging suitcases and everything.\nIf you won't pick up after your dog, don't travel with your dog. Heck, if you won't pick up after it, you shouldn't have a dog.", "Sorry this doesn\u2019t read like a real post", "ESH...wow.", "\n>She just says please leave me alone and goes by me.\n\nESH - it's obvious why the lady sucks, but dude just leave the woman alone at this point.", "ESH. but you are the bigger AH. Yes she was irresponsible, but you straight up bullied her. I once spilled a cup of freshly bought coffee at the airport. I was so embarrassed but I had nothing with me to clean it up with and had to catch my flight on time. I was again very embarrassed with all the stares I got, but you know what the airport staff cleaned that up in a few minutes. Not all people can act their best at all times.

Pretty sure everyone\u2019s had the unfortunate event of doing so at some point in their lives.

It's totally understandable that you were pissed when you saw the woman with the dog not pick up its crap in the airport. Nobody wants to step in dog shit, and it's important for pet owners to be responsible for their animals' waste. However, the way you confronted the woman and followed her around was not the best way to handle the situation. Harassing her and causing a scene in the airport was not necessary or respectful. It's okay to be firm and assertive when addressing a problem, but there are more effective and appropriate ways to do it. In this case, everyone could have handled things differently and more calmly, so it's fair to say that everyone sucks here. It's important to try to find ways to address problems and conflicts in a respectful and effective manner, rather than resorting to inappropriate or aggressive behavior.", "ESH she is clearly an unrepentant AH and the kind of person who ruins shit for everyone.
