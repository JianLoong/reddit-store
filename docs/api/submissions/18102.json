I said I had to use the bathroom. She started confronting me about how she can hear me douching and making all  kinds of \u201cdisgusting splooshing noises\u201d in the bathroom because it\u2019s next to her room.\n\nI had no idea what to say to what so I just stared at her in shock and said \u201cwhat??\u201d. She just said \u201cyou heard me!\u201d and talked about how she feels VIOLATED hearing what I\u2019m doing in the bathroom and that I should just do things like that when she\u2019s not at home or go to CVS for the bathroom.\n\nThis is so stupid to me because if anyone should feel violated here it\u2019s me and she\u2019s the one listening to what others are doing in the bathroom! I laughed at her in shock because she also has no idea what she\u2019s talking about with her \u201cdo this when I\u2019m not at home or go to CVS\u201d nonsense. I told her to look for a new room if her room sucks so much and that listening to what people are doing in the bathroom (showering/nr1/nr2/or anything else) is fucking weird and creepy. \n\nOur other roommates weren\u2019t around for this but I am definitely planning on at least telling my two friends.

Crossed out portion does not apply", "NTA. What\u2019s done in the bathroom is personal and the correct response is for others to ignore any noises that issue forth. \n\nBut also, stop douching! It is actually bad for your vaginal health.\n\nETA: Just noticed OP is a man. Assuming you have that genitalia, I rescind the bit about vaginal health, but stick by not being allowed to police your bathing and bathrooming processes in your own home.", "NTA. She needs to stop policing what you are doing in the bathroom. You are paying rent for that bathroom - you shouldn't have to leave your home to use it. If she wants you to not use your bathroom, then perhaps she should take up a larger part of the rent.", "NTA. I can hear the upstairs neighbors in the bathroom, but there's really nothing you can do about it...people make sounds, and if there isn't a fan, they're going to be heard. If she wont' move, maybe she could buy a noisy fan for the bathroom people could turn on when they're in there.", "My bedroom also shares a wall with the bathroom. I too can hear others business. I, like a sane individual ignore said sounds I hear. Nta. If she's that inconvenienced tell her to get her own place. As long as you're not leaving a mess for others you're good.", "NTA I would just turn on some music on my phone. And i have the feeling it isn't so much about the sound more about that she has a problem that it is a preparation for anal sex and that is her real problem. Or did she complain to others when they have their poop-party?", "Tell her that you take big dumps that make lots of splashdowns. She sounds crazy.", "Hetero female senior citizen here - NTA.  Play loud music when you're in the bathroom and always try to leave it cleaner than you found it.  A person's bathroom has to be their private place regardless of what's going on.  ETA NTA", "NTA.

What is she going to do when she has a partner or kids who might make other bathroom sounds that she doesn\u2019t like? She needs to learn to get over it. If she doesn\u2019t want to be bothered, she can go somewhere else in the house while you\u2019re using the bathroom, or turn on tv, music, a fan etc\u2026 there\u2019s a better solution than telling you to wait until she is not home or to go somewhere else.", "NTA, and as a former CVS employee please do not listen to her and never do this at CVS or any other public bathroom. Just please don't. Those workers have to deal with enough douches from corporate already.", "I usually run the water in the sink to cover bathroom noises, or turn on the overhead fan, if there is one.

LOL\n\nNTA", "NTA. When you live with people, you will hear lots of sounds emanating from the bathroom. Sometimes smells. Some things simply can\u2019t be helped. All that you can do is agree to keep it clean, use air freshener, etc etc. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly immature to sign up to live with people and think you won\u2019t hear something odd from the bathroom.

I think it's important to note that douching isn't great for your body. If there's an underlying infection, it can push it up inside your uterus. All that aside, I guess you have the right to do it.  \n\n\nYour roommate didn't handle this very well. I think she could have asked you to run some water while you do it or whatever. She can't help what she can hear, but at the same time, the way she handled this very much makes her TA.  \n\n\nNTA, but see a doctor if there's something wrong because douching all the time is really quite bad for you.", "INFO\n\nHow often are you doing this?", "Im going to say no ones the asshole here.

You're fine.", "NTA - is it possible that her issue is less about you douching and more about the reason why? Just seems a really weird thing to confront someone about, using your bathroom for your personal hygiene. Does she complain to other roommates if they take a particularly noisy shit or at the sound of an electric razor or toothbrush? I\u2019m guessing no, which made me wonder if there is a homophobic element?", "Yah, gay guys have to do it so they don't get a bunch of shit on their dicks and all over the place when pounding ass. I can't imagine needing that much prep for something that in order to be pleasurable should be spontaneous, but hey, I'm not a gay guy. So my opinion doesn't matter.", ">and she should be ashamed of herself\n\nUpvote for this part.", "I don\u2019t have a vagina I\u2019m douching for anal penetration", "Its a guy", "When gay dudes have sex, they have to do like an entire day's worth of 'prep' to get ready to receive dick in their ass. They have to wear a butt plug around all day to stretch it out, then they buy and use women's vaginal douches but in their ass. Then they have to shower to get all the shit water off them. Then hope that their colon doesn't refill in the space of time before they receive dick. Because if they try to have sex without all the prep, it's painful, and well, shit gets everywhere.", "Where should he be doing it, the fucking living room?", "Op is a guy.

If it bothers the roommate so much they can wear headphones/earplugs, get a white noise machine, move, or just grow up and deal with it like everyone else.", "Yeah what the fuck do you know your straight you\u2019ve never felt the pleasure of having another man\u2019s arm elbow deep up your ass you can\u2019t say you wouldn\u2019t like it/s", "Username checks out.", "...My jaw is hanging open at your comment.

In horrific detail", "Sounds like someone spends a lot of time fantasizing about unrealistic and over the top scenarios of men having to hold enema water in all day, and their buttholes being so full and stretched out from a butplug, then being a dirty boy, and getting ready to be penetrated by big sexy men.

Who's the asshole? I am, apparently. :)  \n\n\nBut to be fair, I call this an enema.", "Yeah the roomie can go take a flying leap.", "Yah, I'm not sure why not euphemizing it gets a downvote, but meh. I don't mince words.", "OMG thank you! I knew there was an actual word for it but I couldn't for the life of me remember what it was lol", "Enemas are different from douching. Enemas put a lot of water up into the anus and even intestines. Douching is just rinsing out the comparatively small areas between the outer and internal spincters of the anus with a bit of water.", "I mean that's what you do with a Fleet enema as well, and a Fleet is considered the safest way to douche. Not all enemas are the same thing."]}
