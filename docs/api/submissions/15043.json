She had wanted to get a tattoo so I went with her to a place that does walk-ins. One of the artists had the afternoon open so I got one done and it covers most of my shoulder. \n\nSaturday the tattoo was still red and a bit puffy. I got to the venue to get ready with everyone else. My sister didn't say anything about the tattoo so I thought I was good to go. It's a wide strap dress and the strap was irritating my skin and I didn't want to risk staining the straps either so first I tried to just lower it but that was a little awkward moving my arm so I wound up just taking my arm out of the strap completely. I tried tucking the strap into the dress but that wasn't working well so I just let it hang on the side. No one said anything before or during the ceremony. When it was time for pictures my sister just gave me a look and asked if I was being serious about the dress and to wear it the right way. I explained I couldn't because of the tattoo and she told me that that wasn't her problem because I picked a terrible time to get a new tattoo if it interfered with how I was wearing the dress. I did put it right for pictures but it was uncomfortable as hell and pulled my arm back out afterward. I didn't get to talk to my sister much during the reception but she did throw a few dirty looks my way and her other bridesmaids and our aunt told me that I needed to just wear the dress properly for a few hours. This morning I text her to have fun on her honeymoon and never heard anything back which is unusual for her so I text again joking if she was already having too much fun to talk. She did respond but only to tell me she was still a bit mad I refused to just wear the dress right and walked around the whole wedding and reception looking trashy at a special family event in a nice place.

I hope you are luck enough that she still speaks to you after this stunt.", "YTA\n\nThat honestly does sound kind of trashy. Why would you get a tattoo on your shoulder the day before an event like that knowing what dress you would be wearing?

It sounds like everyone was pretty low-key about it, but I don\u2019t blame your sister for being annoyed.

Big time. I cannot believe any adult in their right mind would think it was ok to do this at an obviously formal, important event. It\u2019s almost like you sabotaged your participation in the wedding on purpose.", "YTA for getting a shoulder tattoo when you new you'd be wearing a gown with straps as your sister's bridal attendent in 2 days.

They weren't the people that picked the dress or the one getting married. \n\nYou've prior tattoos, even if those didn't irritate you, it is usually explained that it might and how to care for them.\n\nYou made a choice to get a tattoo so close to the wedding, this wasn't a medical procedure. When it started to bother you, you made another choice and had your arm out of the sleeve.\n\nYou also never apologized to your sister. Maybe there was another solution, wear a wrap or something that would have gone with the dress and no one would have noticed the sleeve?", "Of course YTA\n\nOn a WHIM you decided to get something you knew (unless you were deliberately being \"naive\") would affect the wedding photos and potentially your comfort in the dress.", "YTA. Unless you'd never seen the dress before you knew it would affect the tattoo and your sister's wedding day.

You just wanted to know she's fine with your childish behavior.\nShe's not. Act your age.", "I just... why would you do this? It makes no sense. You *knew* how the dress you were going to have to wear two days later fit. I've never known a reputable, ethical tattoo artist who wouldn't warn a client about the potential for swelling and the tattoo looking kind of shit at first while it heals up so I don't believe you didn't know or weren't warned.\n\nYour sister may have been chill about a lot of wedding stuff but come on. It's still a really important occasion for her. Asking you to please wear your dress correctly is not a big ask and walking around with your entire arm out of one sleeve feels really trashy to me. IDK, I get why your sister is upset especially because it seems like you were really nonchalant about the entire thing and have never apologized. \n\nSorry, but YTA.", "YTA. This was her special day. You could\u2019ve literally gone any other day to get a tattoo. Or just worn it the right way and deal with whatever happened to the dress. Or bought a dress last minute to accommodate your last minute decision. Or covered your dress strap with plastic wrap and a bit of Vaseline as a compromise.\n\nMaybe you could\u2019ve even carefully cut the strap off to make it look like it was a one shoulder dress if no one was wearing a matching one.", "YTA. \n\nSure, you're allowed to get a new tattoo and do whatever you want with your body, but this was particularly badly planned, especially if you were part of the wedding party.", "You had a tattoo on your shoulder on Thursday, knowing you were a bridesmaid in a strappy dress for your actual sister's wedding on Saturday.\n\nYes YTA.  \n\nDo you hate your sister or are you just oblivious?", "YTA. I promise everyone noticed the random strap hanging  out, they were just too polite to ask you wtf you were doing. Tattoos hurt. This is not news. You should have a little harder about the timing on this one.", "YTA\n\nEven from your first line, it doesn't really sound like you cared all that much about this wedding or what it meant to your sister.\n\nIt's your body and your right to get whatever you feel like on it, but doing it at that timing, knowing full well it probably wouldn't look great and could be an issue with wearing the dress, again just shows how little you cared about your sister's wedding. \n\nAnd then, instead of just sucking it up, you decide to make it a spectacle, wearing a formal dress completely wrong for the ceremony and the pictures?? The reception is one thing, but seriously? You couldn't at least suck it up for the hour long ceremony and an hour of pictures?\n\nIf you're going to do something spontaneous without considering the consequences, at least have the decency to own up to it and not make it everyone else's problem.", "YTA.

I had a fresh tattoo - one day old - when I ended up in the hospital for a week due to a throat infection. For that week, the nurses  kept putting the blood pressure cuff over my brand new, unhealed tattoo, multiple times a day. You know that hurts a bit on regular skin? Yeah, now imagine it on freshly inked skin. \n\nIf I could put up with that, you could have put up with a frigging dress strap for a few hours for your sister's wedding.\n\nYou also could have used your head and not gotten a tat 2 days before your sister's wedding, which I'm sure she had been planning for a while. \n\nYou're not just an AH, you're a selfish AH.", "YTA and a bit selfish too. Impulse shoulder tattoo two days before a wedding you are in and knowing the dress is a strapping one? Come on\u2026 how can you think thats not an asshole move?", "YTA, such a stupid and frankly disrespectful thing to do knowing you had a wedding in 2 days", "YTA \n\nIf it was at least a longstanding appointment with some famous tattoo artist you waited years for. But a walk in? Come on.", "YTA: I am making a presumption that you knew about the wedding and what you would be wearing before you got the tattoo.

You are making all the decisions sound casual in your post, but at some point you need to realize that choices have consequences and not just for you. Now, whether she wants to or not, when your sister thinks of her wedding day, she will think of your selfish choices.", "LOL you just couldn't not be the center of attention for one single day, eh?

But honestly, you should\u2019ve just dealt with being uncomfortable.", "I don't know if I'd call you an asshole, but there was definitely a lack of foresight here.

I get that my take on weddings represents a minority, I'm the outlier, and with all due respect to OP, getting a big, visible tattoo that you were somewhat obviously going to have to contend with at the wedding was.... well... kind of stupid.  \n\n\nIt sends a bit of a message to the bride, it's not a special day that merits special consideration to you, like you couldn't have celebrated with your friend after the wedding instead of before.    \n\n\nIt's a soft YTA, but I hardly blame her for being annoyed at how little care you had for her big day.", "NTA.

Lack of foresight on my part.", "Because it was my friend's first one and I wanted to get one with her.", "Maybe we need a YTDA ruling- You're The DumbAss.", "I guess in hindsight I was thinking how my other tattoos weren't bothered by pants or a shirt a day later but they're smaller. I really didn't think my sister would have an issue because she was so chill about other stuff.", "She wore the dress with the strap flapping around. That\u2019s incredibly obnoxious. I guess OP\u2019s sister is lucky that the tattoo was on her shoulder and not her rear end or else it would\u2019ve been a full moon.", "It is inappropriate. It\u2019s a formal, important event. Wearing the dress properly is a very low bar.", "Yeah because I'm sure the bride and groom don't care at all about the photos of their ceremony and reception /s", "OP could\u2019ve also covered the tattoo for the day so the strap didn\u2019t rub or get stained - in the U.K. we call it \u201csecond skin\u201d and its a clear film that goes over fresh tattoos to keep it clean. I know it\u2019s available in the US too so I feel like OP could\u2019ve used it. I\u2019m not a fan of it personally but I would certainly have worn it in this situation. \nEven if the tattooist didn\u2019t have it (and I feel like some dude with walk in space on a random Thursday to do a massive shoulder piece *might not* be the most technically advanced) she could\u2019ve bought it online to be delivered before the wedding.\nOP is TA", "People with Main Character Syndrome. Mostly.", "And so you had to get a huge shoulder piece? Two days before you knew you had to wear a specific dress? If you really wanted to just support your friend you could have either just a. Held her hand or something while she\u2019s getting her tat or b. Gotten something small that could be comfortably bandaged so you didn\u2019t have to worry about staining the dress. There\u2019s no question that YTA. The only question is whether you just don\u2019t think things through or that you deliberately did this for attention to pull focus from your sister on her special day.", "It really wasn\u2019t the time.  I don\u2019t think this makes you a terrible person, but it wasn\u2019t the best judgment.", "Gibbled.", "disheveled, askew, willy nilly", "My mom always pronounced it \u201ccaddy wampus\u201d and would throw the word \u201choopenheimer\u201d around, synonymous with \u201ctrashy\u201d", "I always heard hirdy girdy, not herky jerky. Interesting", "higgledy piggledy", "Helter skelter", "The strap was hanging down. How the hell is that not wonky?", "If it didn\u2019t look wonky your sister wouldn\u2019t be angry with you.", "YTA for being so self centered.", "YTA But it was also your sister's wedding. Why didn't you think about the discomfort of the tattoo and the dress?", "That's the most insanely stupid reason I have ever heard.", "Then why not get something smaller and in a different area and then go back at another time and get this tattoo", "How long did it take to get your whole shoulder tattooed?", "You really didn\u2019t think. End of story. YTA", "Telling that you only reply to the one comment that's not YTA. That makes you doubly YTA. Clearly, you're not really asking for judgements, just absolution for your poor, inconsiderate choices.", "So you only answer a comment that doesn't call you a YTA?", "I'm honestly shocked to read that you have other tattoos since you were being so thoughtless and irresponsible about this one. Yikes.", "You're how old and didn't think a tattoo far larger than your existing ones wasn't going to be more tender and take longer to heal?? Like.... you should maybe not be getting tattoos.... also yes dear YTA.", "Lol only responds to the single comment not calling her out", "So tattoos with different sizes and on different body parts feel differently and heal differently... Wow, that's shocking (to no one but to you)! \n\nAre you sure you have more than one tattoo?", "Wow, a single strap! Why didn't they just cancel the whole wedding?! Their marriage is a facade now! /s", "Where I used to live I went to a walk in on a Saturday in the middle of the day and managed to book 3 hours for a tattoo. The guy was absolutely incredible, had all the equipment, had loads of free-hand sketches that I'd actually got to watch a bit of him drawing, used something like second-skin with a lotion to help as well, there is minimal colour loss even after 10 years and the lining is perfect as far as I am aware (trusting my wife's eyes for this, it's a bit hard to see where it is and I've got naff eyes anyway). I'm just saying, it's not always a warning if a place is empty some days, depends on the kind of city/town/village you live in too!", "With pick me girl comorbidity", "Is hoopenheimer used the same way? \"Her dress is on a little hoopenheimer, she should fix that.\" Which is how I'd use most of these.

I like getting ink done by different artists. I won't go into a no-name shop I've never heard of before but a Thursday afternoon at a shop I know about? Pretty normal for it to be dead. He did a sketch for the idea I've had for a while and showed me his portfolio.", "She would use it more like \u201cYou can\u2019t wear that, you look like a hoopenheimer\u201d or \u201cpeople are gonna think hoopenheimers live here if we don\u2019t clean up the yard\u201d\n\nI think it was her version of \u201cwhite trash\u201d or \u201credneck\u201d without being as offensive", "I am all about personal choice, but right before your sister's wedding when you were likely still adjusting to the tattoo? Not the brightest choice.", "If it's common for it to be dead, couldn't you just have gone on a Thurs after the wedding?", "The point was to get one done while my friend was getting her first.", "So you had the genius idea to get a large tattoo on your shoulder two days before a wedding? You could have gotten a small tattoo anywhere else. The lack of foresight here is baffling.", "You could have gotten one that wouldn\u2019t interfere with your dress."]}
