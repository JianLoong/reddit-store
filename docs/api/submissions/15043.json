She had wanted to get a tattoo so I went with her to a place that does walk-ins. One of the artists had the afternoon open so I got one done and it covers most of my shoulder. \n\nSaturday the tattoo was still red and a bit puffy. I got to the venue to get ready with everyone else. My sister didn't say anything about the tattoo so I thought I was good to go. It's a wide strap dress and the strap was irritating my skin and I didn't want to risk staining the straps either so first I tried to just lower it but that was a little awkward moving my arm so I wound up just taking my arm out of the strap completely. I tried tucking the strap into the dress but that wasn't working well so I just let it hang on the side. No one said anything before or during the ceremony. When it was time for pictures my sister just gave me a look and asked if I was being serious about the dress and to wear it the right way. I explained I couldn't because of the tattoo and she told me that that wasn't her problem because I picked a terrible time to get a new tattoo if it interfered with how I was wearing the dress. I did put it right for pictures but it was uncomfortable as hell and pulled my arm back out afterward. I didn't get to talk to my sister much during the reception but she did throw a few dirty looks my way and her other bridesmaids and our aunt told me that I needed to just wear the dress properly for a few hours. This morning I text her to have fun on her honeymoon and never heard anything back which is unusual for her so I text again joking if she was already having too much fun to talk. She did respond but only to tell me she was still a bit mad I refused to just wear the dress right and walked around the whole wedding and reception looking trashy at a special family event in a nice place.

Everyone was probably very disturbed having to look at that.\n\nPlan better", "YTA, why did you get a tattoo then?  It\u2019s inconsiderate.  You could easily have just waited.", "You got a  shoulder tattoo 2 days before your sister's wedding, in which you are a bridesmaid, and you have the nerve to ask in AItA if you are an AH?\n\nYTA for asking, YTA for what you did.", "Yea YTA- less than 2 days before you're supposed to wear a very specific outfit for a special occasion you decided to get a tattoo??

I hope you are luck enough that she still speaks to you after this stunt.", "YTA\n\nThat honestly does sound kind of trashy. Why would you get a tattoo on your shoulder the day before an event like that knowing what dress you would be wearing?

It sounds like everyone was pretty low-key about it, but I don\u2019t blame your sister for being annoyed.

Big time. I cannot believe any adult in their right mind would think it was ok to do this at an obviously formal, important event. It\u2019s almost like you sabotaged your participation in the wedding on purpose.", "YTA for getting a shoulder tattoo when you new you'd be wearing a gown with straps as your sister's bridal attendent in 2 days.

They weren't the people that picked the dress or the one getting married. \n\nYou've prior tattoos, even if those didn't irritate you, it is usually explained that it might and how to care for them.\n\nYou made a choice to get a tattoo so close to the wedding, this wasn't a medical procedure. When it started to bother you, you made another choice and had your arm out of the sleeve.\n\nYou also never apologized to your sister. Maybe there was another solution, wear a wrap or something that would have gone with the dress and no one would have noticed the sleeve?", "Of course YTA\n\nOn a WHIM you decided to get something you knew (unless you were deliberately being \"naive\") would affect the wedding photos and potentially your comfort in the dress.", "YTA. Unless you'd never seen the dress before you knew it would affect the tattoo and your sister's wedding day.

You just wanted to know she's fine with your childish behavior.\nShe's not. Act your age.", "I just... why would you do this? It makes no sense. You *knew* how the dress you were going to have to wear two days later fit. I've never known a reputable, ethical tattoo artist who wouldn't warn a client about the potential for swelling and the tattoo looking kind of shit at first while it heals up so I don't believe you didn't know or weren't warned.\n\nYour sister may have been chill about a lot of wedding stuff but come on. It's still a really important occasion for her. Asking you to please wear your dress correctly is not a big ask and walking around with your entire arm out of one sleeve feels really trashy to me. IDK, I get why your sister is upset especially because it seems like you were really nonchalant about the entire thing and have never apologized. \n\nSorry, but YTA.", "YTA. This was her special day. You could\u2019ve literally gone any other day to get a tattoo. Or just worn it the right way and deal with whatever happened to the dress. Or bought a dress last minute to accommodate your last minute decision. Or covered your dress strap with plastic wrap and a bit of Vaseline as a compromise.\n\nMaybe you could\u2019ve even carefully cut the strap off to make it look like it was a one shoulder dress if no one was wearing a matching one.", "YTA. \n\nSure, you're allowed to get a new tattoo and do whatever you want with your body, but this was particularly badly planned, especially if you were part of the wedding party.", "You had a tattoo on your shoulder on Thursday, knowing you were a bridesmaid in a strappy dress for your actual sister's wedding on Saturday.\n\nYes YTA.  \n\nDo you hate your sister or are you just oblivious?", "YTA. I promise everyone noticed the random strap hanging  out, they were just too polite to ask you wtf you were doing. Tattoos hurt. This is not news. You should have a little harder about the timing on this one.", "YTA\n\nEven from your first line, it doesn't really sound like you cared all that much about this wedding or what it meant to your sister.\n\nIt's your body and your right to get whatever you feel like on it, but doing it at that timing, knowing full well it probably wouldn't look great and could be an issue with wearing the dress, again just shows how little you cared about your sister's wedding. \n\nAnd then, instead of just sucking it up, you decide to make it a spectacle, wearing a formal dress completely wrong for the ceremony and the pictures?? The reception is one thing, but seriously? You couldn't at least suck it up for the hour long ceremony and an hour of pictures?\n\nIf you're going to do something spontaneous without considering the consequences, at least have the decency to own up to it and not make it everyone else's problem.", "YTA.

I had a fresh tattoo - one day old - when I ended up in the hospital for a week due to a throat infection. For that week, the nurses  kept putting the blood pressure cuff over my brand new, unhealed tattoo, multiple times a day. You know that hurts a bit on regular skin? Yeah, now imagine it on freshly inked skin. \n\nIf I could put up with that, you could have put up with a frigging dress strap for a few hours for your sister's wedding.\n\nYou also could have used your head and not gotten a tat 2 days before your sister's wedding, which I'm sure she had been planning for a while. \n\nYou're not just an AH, you're a selfish AH.", "YTA and a bit selfish too. Impulse shoulder tattoo two days before a wedding you are in and knowing the dress is a strapping one? Come on\u2026 how can you think thats not an asshole move?", "YTA, such a stupid and frankly disrespectful thing to do knowing you had a wedding in 2 days", "YTA \n\nIf it was at least a longstanding appointment with some famous tattoo artist you waited years for. But a walk in? Come on.", "YTA: I am making a presumption that you knew about the wedding and what you would be wearing before you got the tattoo.

You are making all the decisions sound casual in your post, but at some point you need to realize that choices have consequences and not just for you. Now, whether she wants to or not, when your sister thinks of her wedding day, she will think of your selfish choices.", "LOL you just couldn't not be the center of attention for one single day, eh?

But honestly, you should\u2019ve just dealt with being uncomfortable.", "I don't know if I'd call you an asshole, but there was definitely a lack of foresight here.

I get that my take on weddings represents a minority, I'm the outlier, and with all due respect to OP, getting a big, visible tattoo that you were somewhat obviously going to have to contend with at the wedding was.... well... kind of stupid.  \n\n\nIt sends a bit of a message to the bride, it's not a special day that merits special consideration to you, like you couldn't have celebrated with your friend after the wedding instead of before.    \n\n\nIt's a soft YTA, but I hardly blame her for being annoyed at how little care you had for her big day.", "NTA.

Imagine if some of the groomsmen just rolled up a leg of their pants and walked around a wedding reception like that because they were uncomfortable. Wouldn't that be weird?

Trashy post of the day award!", "Truly my first thought was \u201cwhat in the pick me is this\u201d", "My fiance's family says something (or someone) looks \"like the wreck of the Hess!\" when it's all catty whampus.", "I submit jankey", "I believe it\u2019s \u201ccatty-whompus\u201d.

And you were half out of it. One strap hanging down with your arm out does in fact look trashy.", "Listen, you *knew* that the wedding was coming, what you were wearing, & everything that comes with being in a wedding party & you still *chose* to get a tattoo that you knew wouldn't be healed in time causing everything that occurred. \n\nYTA & if you had one strap off, then it WAS wonky. People noticed, which means that it very much wasn't like it slightly slipped down. You literally took your arm out, which is extremely noticeable. \n\nAll of this could have been avoided if you weren't so self-centered & waited to get your tattoo or chose a place where you wouldn't have had an issue. Even putting something over the tattoo to protect it while being unnoticeable was an option. What you did from the moment you decided to get the tattoo all the way to slipping out your arm was the wrong choices. \n\nApologize & next time don't get a tattoo in a place that will be uncomfortable while healing when you KNOW you're having to be in/at a big event & wear something that will cause discomfort if you do get one in a bad place like you did this time. \n\nYour sister's wedding was only 1 day. The tattoo, the artist, & your friend could be scheduled any time.", "You must have a very different and self-serving definition of what constitutes \"wonky.\"\n\nYou were walking around in a dress with one arm out and the strap was just hanging uselessly to the side. Oh, and your shoulder was red and puffy and hideous.\n\nI don't have to see a photo to know it definitely did look wonky.", "then you two should have planned it and waited until after the wedding. it obviously wasn\u2019t something she had been longing to do since you went to a place the day of. would it have killed you to go the following week?", "Well, it IS all about you.  You\u2019re such an asshole.", "Ah yes I forgot the only tattoos you can legally get are large shoulder pieces. Nothing small in a less conspicuous area. Silly me.", "And so you settled on a huge shoulder piece when you were a walk-in? Seriously? I'm not a tattoo guy so I'm going to try to avoid talking out of my ass, but like...pretty wildly irresponsible right?", "Bingo .  Sounds like a passive aggressive move to me.", "So why did you choose a huge tattoo in an inconvenient place the day before the wedding? You could\u2019ve gotten a small forearm tattoo or something.", "> Lack of foresight\n\nYou presumably had hours in a tattoo shop chair to think this through... It's not like it snuck up on you.", "What a stupid reason to get a massive shoulder tattoo two days before a wedding you know you have a specific dress to wear for a specific role.\n\nYou're either deeply stupid or deeply selfish.", "You keep saying that but it's not a good excuse. You've had tats before so you know it would be red and sore.", "INFO did she want you to get one done with her? Or did you take it upon yourself to become part of it?", "So, you made her first tattoo about you by deciding you had to get one then, too? You literally could have had the artist do a sketch & schedule a time for after the wedding if you'd wanted them to do it. You didn't *need* to get it done right then. You just wanted it done knowing very well what comes along with that choice.", "Then you should have been uncomfortable for your sister\u2019s sake and worn the damn dress the right way. You sent the message that you could not possibly care less about your sister and her wedding as I\u2019m sure you meant to.  Do you realize how bad you made yourself look?", "Then deal with 5 minutes of discomfort for photos. This is ludicrous.", "I like this idea! :-)", "Same. They made a valid point", "You really didn\u2019t think. I wonder how often your use that excuse and expect other people to just let you off the hook because they are \u201cso chill\u201d and usually don\u2019t expect anything of you. I bet if we ask you sister, she\u2019d roll her eyes and tell us about all the times you just did what you wanted without any thought for other people or their events. \n\nYou effectively made yourself a talking point at your sister\u2019s wedding, distracting everyone from the ceremony with your choice to wear the dress like an idiot, and had to be told to be a grownup for the photos.

I have an allergy to certain adhesives, so my tattoo artist said it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to use it on me. The better option would\u2019ve been to just wait until AFTER the wedding to get the tattoo.", "Second skin is also available in the US. OP is definitely AH here.", "We have that in the US too. I used it on my last tattoo.", "We call it sandiderm here in the States. I got it for my most recent tattoo.", "Exactly! Worst case scenario, she could have simply put bandages over the tattoo to protect the area from the strap.", "Yep. Have used this to heal many large pieces including a neck to crack full back piece lol. Girl woulda been fine honestly.", "It was fo free", "I got my shoulder/collar bone tattoo done in one session.. but it was a 6 hour session. It definitely didn\u2019t happen in an afternoon.", "I got mine inner forearm so was wondering if shoulders would be more painful, so good to know! I wear a coat and honestly the pain wasn't that bad even on the first day to where I couldn't wear clothing lmao.", "I think only the Swedish Chef says it that way.", "Because I didn't have plans for any smaller ones.", ">You're either deeply stupid or deeply selfish.\n\nPor que no los dos?", "It's not my whole shoulder. It's a little smaller than my hand and took little more than 4 hours.", "It\u2019s personal preference really, of both the artist and client. I\u2019ve used it before and don\u2019t really rate it - I\u2019m happy to keep mine clean and moisturised without covering (after the initial few hours that is) and I\u2019ve never had any issues in over 20 years getting tattoos. That said, second skin would be perfect for this situation as it\u2019s clear, unobtrusive and would\u2019ve meant OP could\u2019ve worn the dress properly without discomfort or staining.", "If it's something you want you can buy some from Walgreens or Amazon for pretty cheap and do a little test- that's what I had to do and I was lucky enough not to react! But then I changed my mind and turned it down anyway because I'm a creature of habit haha", "I\u2019m also allergic to certain adhesives so at my tattoo consultation I asked for a piece of the saniderm so I could put it on and find out if I would have an allergic reaction and it\u2019s honestly one of the few bandages I can wear.", "Fair enough - where I live I\u2019d be very unlikely to find a decent artist without a wait list any day of the week. You can get walk ins or decent tattoos; not both where I live! Glad you had a good experience though! \nHaving said that, my point about second skin still stands - OP could\u2019ve and should\u2019ve used it. I just looked and it\u2019s on Amazon with prime delivery.", "You got super lucky", "It was almost 10 years ago, but I got a big shoulder tattoo (planned out in advance and all) and I don't remember it hurting particularly much afterwards. But, I got mine done with an appointments only top line artists so I wouldn't surprised if a shop that can take walk-ins for a big piece like that, is uhhh not the cleanest. And I'm sure if I got it done now with the new healing tech available it would be even less painful.", "From what I've been told, it will hurt more going over bone, so sternum spine and shoulders can hurt more.\n\nMy experience so far though is the worst was the bottom of my foot. Long story on that one.\n\nI actually fell asleep when getting the nape of my neck done, so what do I know?", "You didn\u2019t have plans for this one by the sounds of it.", "You got a large day of tattoo from an artist that you didn\u2019t research 2 days before your sisters wedding?

And why couldn't they wait 3 days?", "Good point, well made!", "A tattoo of that size took over 4 hours? What did you get?\n\nYTA. Your judgement is seriously flawed.", "was this an apprentice level tattoo artist?! how on earth could a tattoo the size of your hand take 4 hours??", "And was your friend planning to have to spend 4 hours at the tattoo studio, or did you cause her to have to hang around longer than she was expecting?

Particularly with COVID and education around staying home when you're sick, cancellations have increased. Very surprising that it doesn't happen where you are!", "This!! My friend wanted my tattoo artist to do his face on a walk in but she didn\u2019t have time that day and offered to get him booked in later. Granted he didn\u2019t want anything huge or overly complicated but she was so booked up because she\u2019s a great artist", "Fair enough but that\u2019s not really the point is it?", "I've been with friends when they had gotten tattoo's in different parlours, in different towns and cities and some of them were walk in's as well and the quality was as good as mine. They did look up the place first/or knew others who had also had ink done there, so it's not completely blind picking a place. It's definitely not super hard to find these places, there is even one in the new town I am living in like this too.", "Spine isn\u2019t that bad \u2026 but lemme tell you\u2026 the sacrum? every nerve ending in your lower half will be on fire", "Lol. True.", "I just got my first tattoos, done in one sitting and totaling an area of maybe 3\u201dx3\u201d, and the artist spent maybe 30 minutes on it. I was in and out of the studio in just about an hour between making adjustments to the design and figuring out placement. \n\nNo shading though, and only black single needle line work, so that may be the difference.", "I don\u2019t even know how it would take an apprentice that long. This is absolutely bonkers.", "One of my tattoo artist keeps some afternoons clear for walk ins or just catching up on things around the shop. She only opens her schedule three months ahead so it's never hard to schedule with her and I love that.\n\nMy other tattoo artist is booked until summer 2024 (and the last time I checked was in December so who knows now) but they both do incredible work!", "Why is everyone so fussed about it being before the wedding? Its just a tattoo. It's not like OP decided to order the brides cake 5 minutes before the wedding.", "Probably, haven't gotten that far down, working on a design for my inner forearm to have as a sleeve. But also to cover scars that are bad reminders.", "I have a full sleeve and both legs mostly covered and only my largest pieces took around 3 hours. These included full color and shading.", "Because it caused her not to be able to wear her dress properly.", ">Why is everyone so fussed about it being before the wedding?\n\nBecause generally when you are going to a wedding (or any formal event) it's not exactly an option to wear a light, baggy t-shirt /or a strapeless top because of the discomfort from the tattoo like it's possible on any other day, especially not when you are a bridesmaid. You are expected to dress up, wear more formal clothes. OP knew what dress she will have to wear in two days for the event but didn't take it into consideration when picking a date to get inked that she will have to be able to actually wear that dress and wear it properly (strapes or other parts of the dress included). Wearing a dress with a strap hanging next to you at a formal event is tasteless, classless.", "Because she knew what her dress was going to be and she got a tattoo that made wearing her dress a problem causing her to walk around with get dress strap hanging off her shoulder all day.", "Because it being done so close to the wedding is *why* she couldn't wear her dress properly. It being done so close meant it hadn't close to healed by the time of the wedding, resulting in her dress irritating the tattoo", "Because she was in the wedding party and  occasionally it's nice not to be a selfish c*ckwimble.", "Because it\u2019s classless to be walking around a wedding with one strap dangling off your dress?

OP seems to like to make herself the focus.", "Oh im sure il surprise the tattoo artist sleeping through it. They sure were amused when I got my chest piece. \n\nJust having issue joining top and lower arm ideas. Should speak to a designer for it.", "I grew up with my guys. I started my sleeve bc one of them was like hey this seems cool when he was stoned one night at like 11 pm and I was like sure why not and now I have a really cool beautiful neo traditional skull & ribcage skeleton piece with beautiful flowers & fungi growing out of it bc nature things & my friends weed"]}
