He left when I was around 10. I was an accident and only my mom wanted to keep me. They weren\u2019t even in a relationship it was just supposed to be a one night stand. The only reason he was in my life at all was because his parents forced him. I only saw him twice after he left, once a couple months later when he came to get something he left and another at the funeral of his parents. He paid child support but that\u2019s about it, no calls on special occasions no gifts for birthdays or Christmas nothing. I hated him at first but eventually I let it go, as someone with no plans on having kids soon I empathized with him a bit.\n\nI\u2019m getting married and invitations went out. I didn\u2019t send one to him because I assumed he wouldn\u2019t want one anyway. Well the other day I got a message from him asking why he wasn\u2019t invited since he needs to walk me down the aisle. I told him I didn\u2019t invite him because I didn\u2019t think he want to come, as for walking me down the isle he wasn\u2019t in my life enough for me to consider him a father figure so he will not get that privilege. He replied that it didn\u2019t matter he was still my father so that is his right. \n\nThat upset me, he\u2019s been avoiding his fatherly duties for over 10 years and now he\u2019s trying step up. So I told him I\u2019m going to send him a list of things he needed to do before I consider him my father. He agreed to this plan. \nHere are some of the things on the list:\n1: send 13 years of birthday present \n2: send 13 years of Christmas present \n3: attend my high school graduation \n4: attend my college graduation \n5: teach me to ride a bicycle \n6: teach me to drive \nPlus a bunch of other milestones in life he missed. He was not happy about this list and called me disrespectful. My mom found about this and she is disappointed in me. She said I should have just told him no and moved on, there was no need to be cruel. I told her I didn\u2019t do it out of malice I did it to show him how much he missed and it was ridiculous of him to expect to be the one to walk be down the aisle. She still thinks I was cruel.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699818670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ts2xz/aita_for_sending_my_dad_a_list_on_why_i_dont/", "score": 334, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You only let him know WHY he may be your sperm donor, but he isn't your father in any sense.", "NTA.\n\nAnd you had best make sure of two things: 1) that he knows he is not invited, and 2) that security at your wedding knows what he looks like and to prevent his entrance if he shows up.\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m reading too much into this. But he said he was going to walk you down the aisle. He didn't ask you if he could or if you wanted him to; he told you he was going to.

It\u2019s unhinged to think he could walk you down the aisle without putting in the work to earn the honor.", "NTA.  It was only right you pointed out everything he had missed and how he had not been part of your life.  Your mother does not get an opinion on this as it is your life he stuffed up and your feelings that he hurt.", "I think what you did was very mature and level-headed, without being cruel or emotional , you let him know!!!! Applause !!! NTA, the opposite of an AH!!! Don\u2019t let anyone tell you different.", "NTA, since it helped you vent some lingering resentment.  Obviously life is not long enough for him to ever make up for the bad choices he made when you were growing up.  And look at what he said about his \u201cright\u201d as your father.  Send him one more note, and simply say, \u201cWell, you asked\u201d.  And then stop.  Stop with him.  Stop with your mom about him.  Stop with us about him.  Stop with yourself about him.  He\u2019s nothing but a waste of your time.", "NTA I think the list was a rather nice touch and he needed to hear it.

Good Riddance to him.", "It was unnecessary as you know that 99% of that list he can't fulfill so the answer will remain no.
