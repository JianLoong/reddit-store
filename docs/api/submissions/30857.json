He left when I was around 10. I was an accident and only my mom wanted to keep me. They weren\u2019t even in a relationship it was just supposed to be a one night stand. The only reason he was in my life at all was because his parents forced him. I only saw him twice after he left, once a couple months later when he came to get something he left and another at the funeral of his parents. He paid child support but that\u2019s about it, no calls on special occasions no gifts for birthdays or Christmas nothing. I hated him at first but eventually I let it go, as someone with no plans on having kids soon I empathized with him a bit.\n\nI\u2019m getting married and invitations went out. I didn\u2019t send one to him because I assumed he wouldn\u2019t want one anyway. Well the other day I got a message from him asking why he wasn\u2019t invited since he needs to walk me down the aisle. I told him I didn\u2019t invite him because I didn\u2019t think he want to come, as for walking me down the isle he wasn\u2019t in my life enough for me to consider him a father figure so he will not get that privilege. He replied that it didn\u2019t matter he was still my father so that is his right. \n\nThat upset me, he\u2019s been avoiding his fatherly duties for over 10 years and now he\u2019s trying step up. So I told him I\u2019m going to send him a list of things he needed to do before I consider him my father. He agreed to this plan. \nHere are some of the things on the list:\n1: send 13 years of birthday present \n2: send 13 years of Christmas present \n3: attend my high school graduation \n4: attend my college graduation \n5: teach me to ride a bicycle \n6: teach me to drive \nPlus a bunch of other milestones in life he missed. He was not happy about this list and called me disrespectful. My mom found about this and she is disappointed in me. She said I should have just told him no and moved on, there was no need to be cruel. I told her I didn\u2019t do it out of malice I did it to show him how much he missed and it was ridiculous of him to expect to be the one to walk be down the aisle.

But he said he was going to walk you down the aisle. He didn't ask you if he could or if you wanted him to; he told you he was going to.

Obviously life is not long enough for him to ever make up for the bad choices he made when you were growing up.  And look at what he said about his \u201cright\u201d as your father.  Send him one more note, and simply say, \u201cWell, you asked\u201d.  And then stop.  Stop with him.  Stop with your mom about him.  Stop with us about him.  Stop with yourself about him.

It would be pretty obvious to all the invitees that he knows nothing about your life. Does he plan to walk you down the aisle them leave right after?", "NTA OP. For all the reasons stated by others.", "NTA\n\n[You remind me of the person who sent her father a PowerPoint.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zh2g3s/aita_for_responding_to_my_fathers_request_for_a/)\n\nWhat you did was nothing compared to the cruelty he inflicted on you as an innocent child. He has zero rights.", "NTA. You just outlined everything he missed because his life was more important to him than yours was. He gave up his \"right\" to walk you down the aisle a long time ago. With your mom defending him, is it possible that she didn't want him in your life? It just seems odd that she's defending him.", "If you were cruel, it was only as cruel as 13 years of abandonment deserved. NTA", "NTA. He already gave you away. He left you. He doesn't get to make it up. We get one life, and he missed those chances. You aren't doing anything wrong. He's reaping what he sowed. If he doesn't like it too bad for him. We should all know shame and guilt when we earn it. He earned it.", "NTA and I love the list idea actually. That's hilarious and it's absolutely perfect to be honest. He deserved that.", "Your bio-dad has some gall to demand that he has rights as your father. Maybe he thinks that years of paying child support makes him entitled to demand things from you but No!\n\nYou were absolutely right in sending him your list. It was not cruel - he literally asked for it and got it. NTA", ">She said I should have just told him no and moved on\n\nYou DID. He didn't accept it", "NTA. And, the most disappointing person in this story is actually your mother.", "NTA. You *did* tell him no. He didn't like that answer. So you gave him a different one. Saying no again wouldn't have changed anything.", "WOW, I'm not going to tell you that you are t   a, but you really need some therapy. Why didn't you just say no and let it go. You have some pent up anger that is just going to make you emotionally upset and need to address it.\n\nThe list is very childish and quite frankly, sad.", "Let mom read the comments. I'd tell her to shove her disappointment, but that's just me. Nta. \"Dad\" doesn't get to sweep in for the \"prestigious\" honor of walking you down the aisle. He gets as much consideration and affection as he gave you.", "Absolutely not cruel. Your Mother is mistaken. NTA", ">father figure so he will not get that privilege. He replied that it didn\u2019t matter he was still my father so that is his right. \n\nYou are quite correct that it's a privilege, not a right.  NTA and keep firm on your stance. \n\nPersonally, I would probably begin all correspondence with him as 'Dear sperm donor...'", "NTA you were NOT cruel. Cruel is walking out on your child. Cruel is making sure your kid knows you never wanted her. Cruel is demanding you have a right to insert your parenting \u201crights\u201d without doing any of the heavy lifting just bc birth control failed.\n\nAnd it is cruel of your mom to try and make you feel guilty about showing your dad all the shit he didn\u2019t bother showing up for.", "zeeelfprince said it best when they said he wants the accolades of being a dad without actually doing the hard work.", "NTA- Sometimes the truth isn't pretty.  Your father decided walked out on your life years ago, he lost any privileges at that time. To have father privileges, you actually have to be involved with your child. Paying child support isn't nearly enough, you have to be present in their lives. To be  there for the happy and sad moments. You can't pick one moment so you can show off to your friends. That's not a father, that's someone who wants to pretend he's a father.", "Nta twist that knife he deserves it", "He was allowed to ask, and you are allowed to say no. He kept pushing, so the gloves come off.  He brought this on by refusing to listen to you. NTA. your mom would also be well-advised to pay attention to how to respect your boundaries.  Don\u2019t budge.", "NTA.  As a father myself, I don't consider it a \"right\" to walk my daughter (13f) down the aisle.  It's a privilege, that when/if she does get married one day I hope to experience. Walking out on a child is one of that most damaging and hurtful things one can do and he can't expect to not have consequences for this.", "NTA .  On the other hand, why even bother?", "there was a reason to be cruel. that reason is called \"dead beat dad\". NTA good for you, for not letting him have anything", "Funny how we're suddenly getting a a slew of posts about deadbeat dads whe want to walk their kids down the \"isle\".", "NTA. Tell him he\u2019s getting bounced if he shows up uninvited", "NTA\n1. First, let me acknowledge the awesomeness you are for sending him that letter! That is a total mic drop moment.\n\n2. Your mom seems like a nice person, but her thoughts on his absence are different from the impact his absence had on you. It's not for her to judge.\n\n3. He agreed to see a list of what you needed to be called a father. It is not on you that he didn't like the list, especially when it appears that you were asking for the bare minimum any child should expect from a parent.", "YTA, but this seems like a situation where being TA may have been warrented.", "It might\u2019ve been a little overkill, but as someone who also has an awful dad I would do the same in a heartbeat, so I can\u2019t blame you at all", "In order to get a father\u2019s privileges, he has to do a father\u2019s duties. Sending a check ain\u2019t it. NTA, block him and enjoy your wedding.", "This subreddit has really become less of am I the asshole, and more am I justified in being the asshole. What you did was 110% cruel. Was it problematic that you were mean? Idk, probably not. Should you have not done it? Probably, but it's not like you sound like you even care about that relationship, so...\n\nI think you could have been more respectful and still gotten the same point across, but also, you're totally justified in being an asshole here.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s easy that he is nothing but a bio dad but your mother? What\u2019s her issue? What you sent was facts. Not cruel. \n\nMy son hasn\u2019t seen nor heard from his father in at least 15 years. He wasn\u2019t given his place in his father\u2019s tribe. Not only that his \u201cfather\u201d went to court and had the court declare him not my son\u2019s father. \n\nMen like this have little to no rights unless their children want them to have them. \n\nGtfoh.\n\nI would never consider the truth cruel. If you don\u2019t want the child, fine. Divorce yourself from expecting anything from the child.", "Exactly. NTA.", "It wasn't cruel. It was a true accounting of all he's missed in your life.", "Even the most involved, best father in the world doesn\u2019t have the right to walk his daughter down the isle.

So succinct yet so profound. You nailed it. \ud83c\udfc5\ud83d\udc4f I hope OP sees this as it is the perfect retort to anyone wanting to argue with her stance.", "Ooo OP you should definitely say this to him!!!", "here have my upvote", "\u201cYou gave me away when I was 10.\u201d", "I have a dad who's been active in my life. I don't know if I'll ever get married, but if I do, I don't intend to be walked down the aisle by anyone.\n\n*If* I did want to be walked down the aisle by anyone, I'd still choose mum over dad.
