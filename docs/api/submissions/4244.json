It's really dumb to do late-night anything in a room full of early-risers who get super cranky when they don't get enough sleep.", "Yes, I'm in Australia and camping in the backyard is not an out there proposition at this time of year.  But cold weather and snow?", "Trying to decide if frost bite in the bum is worth being petty and ruining mom\u2019s flower bed\u2026 I\u2019m gonna have to sleep on that one.", "NTA, who the hell wants to sleep in a tent in winter when there is a couch available? That\u2019s insane.", "You comment made me think of Shrek and I'm now convinced OP's mom is Lord Farquad. Literally just as much of an AH lol", "For real. I'm up at 5 whether I want to be or not so I spend a lot of time being as ninja as possible.", "Excessive fear of interrupting the husband's TV watching may come from a fear of his anger. A friend called to ask my help with her Wifi/printer and while I was trying to help her, she kept asking, nervously,  \"Will this make the Internet go down? John [husband] is watching TV.\" She asked me this like 4 times in about 10 minutes and finally I asked if she was afraid of domestic violence. I had heard that they had had such loud fights in a hotel that people complained, so this is why I suspected it. She laughed it off, but she has twisted herself into knots for him. I am concerned.\n\nSo, just want to say that when a woman is excessively worried about her husband's TV watching being interrupted, there's a decent chance this is not a free choice she is making.\n\nEdited to add: still NTA. No obligation to go along with this or sleep in a tent in the snow!! My mother sacrificed my needs for her 2nd husband. It sucks, no matter what the reason is for it, and you don't have to play along.\n\nEdited again: The demand that you sleep outside is just the tip of the iceberg. The deeper problem are the family dynamics where you are being treated abusively and then shamed when you stand up for yourself, both by your mother and your siblings. When we can't even see how badly we are being treated (and I am guilty of this myself), that's a sign that we have been habituated to neglect or abuse. It's great to get outside eyes on the situation. It would be good to start finding people you can trust to give you healthy feedback in the future, as you re-negotiate your rights in the family.", "Oh shit, you're right.

Exactly why siblings mad.", "If they did don't you think they all would have jumped on it first", "That is if she doesn't die overnight in her sleep in freezing temperatures.", "Like if they have no problem with it why can't they sleep in a tent out in the cold. Like how does OPs mom think this is okay. I like how no one told her this until late especially her mom. Like what hey your my daughter but dumb dumb bob needs to watch tv at night so can't sleep on a couch got to be out in a tent. Her siblings suck and her mom sucks as well as her step dad. Her dad seems nice go there OP don't got sleep in a tent infront of someone's house thats freaking weird.  Go where you are wanted and that is your father's house. screw your siblings", "Yeah, I definitely think that's a strong possibility...\n\nit just seems like there must be something going on in Mom's head...  but then again, maybe not!", "Yes, it really is. Sadly.", "The key thing you said is \u2018on your phone.\u2019\n\nI agree the sexual thing is reaching.

Your oldest sibling would have been 17 she left. So, really, they're doing this for you, and you don't want it. And it's also possible that your stepmom isn't your stepmom and they aren't telling you. So much to unpack here just because of the age difference.

Wow..they need help", "Yeah. The mother is ACTIVELY participating in compromising this woman's basic safety so her husband can watch tv. WHAT.", "If they have enough money to fly everyone out, then why don't they just buy a TV for their bedroom? It's such a simple solution.", "You can die in your sleep if it's below freezing out.

I have done it (alone as a single woman and later with my partner) since i was 8 years old (scouts and on vacation).\nStatistics proof that it is more likely to be run over by a car, than to be attacked by a person/attacked by an animal etc. while camping . \n\nCoyotes aren't a thing in Western Europe. They are problematic in the US because they are more used to humans than wolves for an example and they are not that shy and have been fed by stupid people. \n\nIn Europe the most wolves are shy and you are lucky if you can see one in the wild. \n\nThe cold is the real danger. If you don't have propper gear it isn't a good idea to camp outside.", ">There is absolutely nothing in the post that would lead a rational person to this conclusion.\n\nSo you think the bio-mother is being totally rational? A tent in the backyard in Western Europe in winter is rational to you?", ">Easier, bc no one will hear her scream.\n\nMight be safer if the neighbors can hear her scream...  where as inside they wouldn't be able to hear her as well.  I don't know if the house is in a town center or edge of a village, or out in the country though...", "It's AITA no one is rational lol. But there is a fundamental difference between \"normal\" suck like a mother choosong her new husband over her kids vs omg he's a pedo. Every other post here is about a parent choosing a partner over a child. That happens, like, all the time and is a much much more likely scenario. \n\nOp NTA. YOU didn't cause anything. Your selfish mother did.", "I think it now makes sense that OP was raised by her father and stepmother.", "I never said for everyone. I said for many families. Just have a look through rape statistics and you'll find it's a whole lot more common than you would think.

Also, I live in Canada, I've spent Christmases in Western Europe the exact same winter gear I wear at home, and I was FREEZING because of the humidity. OP would catch her death out there.", "I\u2019m also confused by how OP is a nuisance if she\u2019s willing to put up with his TV thing in exchange for sleeping inside. It\u2019s rude to alienate someone by being noisy while they\u2019re trying to sleep but saying that the person TRYING TO SLEEP is a nuisance is just wild to me\u2026", "Or tell them to have some of their kids go sleep in the tent, then they'll realize how ridiculous it is for a parent to expect their children to sleep outside.", "Right?! Like can't he move the tv into his bedroom? Oh, his wife doesn't want to hear the tv that late? Then get her husband headphones for the tv.\n\nI have an elderly friend living with me and he's hard of hearing so I got him very comfy headphones bc he won't wear earbuds. He loves them bc the sound is much better. \n\nIf she's not willing to make a simple adjustment so OP doesn't have to sleep outside in a tent in winter then OP should not even go. \n\nNTA", "It's in western Europe.

Hopefully we get an update.", "I have slept outside, no tent, at near freezing, by choice. But I was layered  in silk underwear, wool layer, polartech, etc, covered with wool blankets, plus two cats. This was for an enjoyable lark, several times, on our own property, so the house was nearby. The body layers were important.\n\nI live in NC, US, so this was fairly chilly as a sleeping temperature to me. But we have uncomfortable temperature swings, lowest in my 63 yrs is -10F, highest, 105F. I save $$ by keeping the heat at 55F to 50F, if I can sneak 50F past my husband. Turn the thermostat down by a degree every week. When we were separated for several years, and I had to economize, I set the AC at 83F, but I was spending most of my time outside, in blazing heat/humidity. Realized I could don more warm clothing, but I couldn't remove my skin. So saved $$ in winter, to afford some AC, fans in summer.\n\nPretty amazing, the temperature variations that we can become accustomed to. Despite growing up in a hot humid climate, I would prefer to live in a cold dry climate. My husband was born/raised in NY State. But on colder days, my NC born hands are toasty warm, as are my feet.

A tent outside in the northern hemisphere in December. Yeah that's not an option.
