If that's her total household bills, when she's doesn't have to pay rent or groceries, that's a pretty good deal.", "If I were the GF, I will pick paying rent over just moving in. Paying rent gives you some security (how much varies from country to country). Moving in with someone without being co-owner / co-renter means you can be kicked at any time and be homeless. That is the short end of the straw.", "you are legit only listening and responding to the people agreeing with you - this makes you even more TA", "it\u2019s easy to not see how someone who got the apartment for free, is only paying property taxes, groceries, and then these three bills and offering to help the girlfriend they supposedly care about, by having her take over these three bills which somehow add up to the price of her rent, is being shitty as fuck, when you\u2019re someone whose come from a privileged place. it\u2019s clear to see that your offer to \u201chelp\u201d her is really more to just benefit yourself. she can\u2019t save any extra money than she has been if she\u2019s going to just have to pay you that amount to stay with you. you\u2019re telling her she can stay \u201cfor free\u201d but that\u2019s not the reality. her rent is the cost of those three bills now. every roommate/girlfriend/boyfriend situation i\u2019ve lived with, we split everything down the middle, and got our own groceries. because that\u2019s what fair. she sees that how you\u2019re splitting it, isn\u2019t fair, because most of us aren\u2019t privileged and looking through the world in that lease. that\u2019s why only a FEW people are agreeing with you, and most people are telling you to split the costs. because that\u2019s genuinely what\u2019s the most fair and honest in this situation. you say you love her or care about her, but you\u2019re clearly taking advantage of her situation to improve your own. and that\u2019s not how you treat someone you care or love. if i was her tbh i would turn you down based off principles alone and id really re think the relationship. for me, a relationship is about one day being our forever person, and mixing our lives together. the way you went about it would show me you\u2019re probably going to always prioritize your station in life and yourself first, and that\u2019s not what i would personally want from a partner. it would also show me how you view the world from that standpoint of privilege and really make me rethink it. but that\u2019s just me", "She also gets an AH like you. Long term she might be better with the landlord", "What????", "INFO: how much will you spend on groceries compared to the amount your gf will pay in utilities? Why not split these down the middle?", "He is already paying for groceries and yearly tax and gf can easily pay for Electricity internet and water. He is actually saving money for her and u are calling him stupid smh.", "This is all true, but she should still have at least one bill in her name.  This is helpful to prove residency, and for things like registering to vote.", "How is expecting her to contribute and not be a freeloader, ripping her off?", "Umm he is letting her stay at HIS place absolutely for free and just asking for her to pay 3 bills which more than fair and also if he wanted to screw her he could have asked her to pay for rent as well you dumbass\ud83d\ude02\u2620\ufe0f", "Well, if you read the post, it would mean he is potentially taking the larger portion here. If my case matches his. I doubt that is true, but it's not beyond impossible at all. \n\nHonestly, I think OP is probably being vague on purpose. My response was to another comment though and just to suggest given our limited information we don't actually know what the real split is.", "That\u2019s why I specified where. Internet could be as low as 20, water probably 50, and electric 150-250 depending on where they live. That\u2019s about 2-3 weeks of groceries for 2 people\u2026 not to mention he pays the end of year tax, however much that is \n\nBoth these people sound cheap as fuck", "But there are two questions.  \n\n\nIs monthly grocery bill around the same as bills for utilities?  \nIs yearly property tax+yearly grocery bills close to yearly utility bills?   \n\n\nBecause if it's not then OP might be ripping his gf off. Besides why not split everything 50/50? Then both are paying exactly the same sum of money and no argument can be made.", "Way to counter an argument no one is making.", "You're ripping her off because you're expecting her to contribute significantly more than you will to your own house, making life much easier on yourself and taking advantage of her current predicament concerning rent. You should split according to income or 50/50, there's no fairness to it otherwise. You're supposed to be her partner, not her landlord. You say you don't want to mix finances... You don't have to, not on paper, but however you guys decide to split the bills.... That's what mixing finances is, whether documented or not.\n\nYou could also open up a checking account together so you can both use that for all household expenses. You can both contribute a set monthly amount (50/50, 60/40) and if you ever break up, you can split the remaining money that way and delete the account.", "it\u2019s not for free if she\u2019s paying bills to stay there are you dumb? lol she would be paying all\u2019s if his bills for him at that point, as he doesn\u2019t have any rent or anything to pay but the yearly taxes on it. he figured she\u2019d be so grateful at hearing \u201crent free\u201d that she wouldn\u2019t stop to think about how he also said she would still be paying the same amount as her old rent. that\u2019s not \u201cfor free\u201d", "idk dude it sounds like a you problem. if you can\u2019t learn how to shop frugally, especially with the price gouges rn, then maybe you\u2019re just not that good with money. because i keep seeing you say but i\u2019ve never seen or heard of anyone else in my entire life saying this", "If you were able to read, you would have seen that he explicitly said \"Why do you want to rip her off?\"", "Or my mortgage is that low... \n\nI'm not calling it highly likely but if you live in some of the cheapest places in the US, her rent could have been as low as 400 or 450... a one bedroom apartment in the hood or some super conservative backwoods areas is still that. Meanwhile spending 400 for 2 people in groceries now a days really isn't that u heard of. \n\nOnce again not calling it likely, but it's not impossible", "The poster didn't say OP shouldn't charge her at all, just that doing anything other than splitting bills in some consistent way was ripping her off. No one is arguing she should be a freeloader. Apparently while you can read, you're not so great at comprehension.", "This isn\u2019t the early 2000s \n\nUnless she\u2019s in some sort of government housing no way is a 1bd less than 800", "If they bills average out then how is that ripping her off?"]}
