And u arent in the UsA so where are u, in Dubai? Cause i cant imagine anywhere where utilities would cost the same as rent plus groceries would be more. Very sketchy.\n\nJust split it proportionally according to your incomes", "So you don\u2019t plan on using electricity or the water?", "Your GF likes to throw around the term \"unfair\" for anything she doesn't like.  Are utilities particularly high in your country?  Here in the US monthly electricty, water, and internet would be no where near the same amount as rent-- even in a tiny apartment.\n\nDoes her current rent include electricity, water, and internet as well or would she still need to pay for those as well?\n\nHow great is the difference between your salary and your GF?\n\nWas she expecting to just live with you and not contribute financially?", "YTA. .you are taking advantage of her, and you know it.  \nNow she is either your girlfriend & therefore you should be in a PARTNERSHIP.  otherwise, she is a tenant, and you should draw up an agreement.  \nIf you are in this as a partner, split everything 50% or 60/40 since you are making money.  Let's be honest, at any time if you wanted to, you could sell that apartment & make a mint.  \nHowever, you two don't seem to be in such a good relationship, so she should just pay the extra rent or rent somewhere else, and you live just like you are.", "YTA you should split bills equally, and also groceries if you eat meals together.", "Yta", "Why the hell do so many people think they should be able to move in with someone & live for free?  NTA  She should pay her share.  How you determine the share is a conversation you should have.  Before marriage, I am a fan of 50/50 expenses.  Once you marry & have that commitment, split proportional to income.  Or do that from the start if you think that is fair.  Even if you own the place outright, there is still maintenance & repair.  If something breaks, you need to repair/replace it.  No place is truly free.", "NTA - BUT you need to write out all expenses including taxes on the property you have and split it evenly down the middle so she sees what you are paying for also. It could be that you gave her the short end or you could be taking advantage. \n\nEither way make a lease and an agreed upon rent. \n\nJust because you make more money doesn\u2019t mean you should carry the burden with a person who is not your spouse. This is how men and women end up getting financially used.", "NTA, but the arrangement is 100% to your advantage.  She would be wiser to find a place with a platonic roommate that might allow her to save some money.   You can get a roommate too, if all you want is your utilities paid.", "NTA. It sounds like she wants free room and board. For sure take the yearly taxes and use it against any other costs. Do not let her just move in and pay nothing or not half of utilities. So if your yearly taxes and the groceries are more than what the utilities are then she shouldn\u2019t be complaining. Otherwise you two moving in together is not a good idea.", "YTA\n\nSplit things fairly. You should each pay for half of electricity, half of groceries, etc. \n\nBills are definitely more than groceries. And, in the case of a controlling partner\u2026. the one in charge of the groceries can go \u201cno, I\u2019m not buying your pads!\u201d Or deny their partner typical essentials and regular luxuries (like a nice quality chocolate bar as a treat or something) because it\u2019s THEIR money. \n\nYour division of costs leaves you getting the better financial deal and also leaves you in control over groceries and essential items. \n\nSplit it all in half.", "Get real! Electricity, internet and water and food. You would be lucky if she pays half. She brings sex to the equation.   If she doesn't bring that, she is a tenant.", "I would just split all the bills 50/50, including groceries.", "Make whatever arrangements are fair for both of you. If her expectations are to pay nothing towards household expenses, then she needs to stay in her own place. But a 50/50 split seems to be the way to make all parties happy IF the expectation wasn't \"move in live rent free\". Because that's unreasonable and shouldn't be accepted in her current situation.", "When I had a housemate (not dating) whose income was similar to mine, we had one joint checking account which we used for all joint expenses.  We could move money between our personal account and the joint account at the end of the month.  We also had a joint credit card for shared shopping.\n\nWhen I've had housemates where the income or individual rooms used varied, we came up with what everyone agreed was a fair distribution of costs.\n\nYou might want to keep the property taxes separate so she has no claim on the ownership of the home.  Be sure to check about common-law marriage laws and how they affect ownership of the property.\n\nYou need to have a frank discussion with all the options you can come up with.", "YTA. Split the costs. Why should she pay the equivalent of rent while you\u2019re paying next to nothing?", "YATA  \n\n\nhonestly, yall should just come up with a fair pooling of funds outright like keeping your finances separate but also split the food, split the bills, and you need to include in your portion the taxes you pay each year divided by 12 to calculate a portion of money you pay regardless of anyone living there and those enjoing the benefits of the roof can share in its maintenance without gaining ownership...  \n\n\nif one person under your roof runs say 18k a year and adding her takes it to say 25K a year   \nif you split the living costs 50/50 you now pay 13K and she pays 13K a year...  \n\n\nbut the way you offer it   \nshe would be paying way more than half and sure it would be what she was paying.  \nyou would basically be living off of her income leaving her with very little, don't be a landlord be a BF.", "YTA, split the cost of bills 50/50", "Mate wtf \ud83d\ude33 \ud83d\ude02 why would you make her pay all that? Split it evenly 50/50?? Why should you effectively profit off your girlfriend?", "Wait what? No no, electric water internet etc should be split down the middle. It\u2019s ridiculous to ask that she pay 100% of a bill that is always going to change. You also greatly benefit by getting to live basically for free at her expense.", "Definitely NTAH, bro. Sounds like she expects to be kept. Serious problems lie ahead if she\u2019s not willing to contribute 50% of the living expenses.", "YTA\n\nWhat you are asking is inequitable and unreasonable. It would not be surprising at all to me if your girlfriend takes a giant step back and reassesses your entire relationship.\n\nEdited for spacing, and spelling.", "Yta If you're going to live together at least split the cost on things. If she's paying all the utilities and your only paying for groceries then she is paying more money than you are", "He just said all three bills are equal to her rent and he makes more than her. I imagine those are very high bills, not low. If he truly wanted to take the next step (which should be proposing), he should take in consideration their incomes. He was fortunate enough to catch a break and have no mortgage, the least he could do is give a break to a person he loves and have her pay a lower bill or less. YTA, I wouldn\u2019t want to live with you.", "Y\u2019all should just split bills and groceries down the middle. It\u2019s the most fair.", "Yes you are. Basically u get your lovely gf to move in with you and be your mommy, and she pays all ur bills and u buy groceries once a week and thats fair for all shes paying? Yea, no. Might as well quit ur job and watch tv all day and ask her to pay for it since making more money than her means nothing to u either. Cant tell if this bait or u r actually a moron.", "Yta it seems like you're taking advantage of her, plus you make more money ..in no situation is this fair. Split your bills in a way that aligns with your finances or let her go. I'd rather pay a landlord than pay the person I love because that feels hurtful", "My grocery bill solo was way more than my electric, water and internet when in an apartment.  Easily double, if not triple.  In a house it\u2019s still more, but not as much as houses are more expensive", "In our case, groceries for two is twice  what we pay for internet, water and electric. More like 2.3x times actually.", "In my area, my water and electric are about $175/month. I live in the sticks, if I got internet here it'd be $100-150/month. I pay well over $325/month in groceries for 2 people. Depending on OPs cost of living, $700 isn't out of the question.", "Just wait until owners insurance and taxes come due at the yearly renewal I'm sure she will love splitting that 50/50. I understand people that rent have no concept of the costs involved with owning a property but damn people on Reddit are dense.", "It really is a dick move. OP's currently paying all the bills for the home he was gifted. She moves in and OP has her pay 3 of the bills he was paying. Now OP is paying a lot less every month, but she's paying as much as she was living in her own place. I'm not seeing where moving in with OP benefits her in any way, except for the rent increase she would pay to continue to live where she is. If she's not happy with OP's arrangement, which she already isn't, and she hasn't even moved in. In what country does buying groceries for 1 extra person equal utilities, internet and water bills? I'm pretty sure she'd still be buying some groceries she wants along with any of her personal care needs. OP needs to rethink how the bills should be split. IMO she should just stay at her own place, pay her own bills and move on from OP if he can't see what's wrong with his thinking.", "Also what utilities are equivalent to her old rent?? It\u2019s funny that he didn\u2019t mention HOA which seems to be factored into utilities. If money isn\u2019t an issue for OP idk why he would want to nickel and dime his gf. \nThis is not a \u2018next step\u2019 but rather an opportunity to benefit off her situation and gain a house maid that pays his bills/keeps him warm and he only has to feed her. Gross.", "Well-explained! I wish I could give you gold.", "He said he\u2019s paying for all the groceries\u2014I\u2019m assuming she was feeding herself before, which can easily be a couple hundred dollars a month.", "Frankly it seems like that is key word for HOA since it\u2019s \u2018equivalent to her old rent\u2019. Pretty disgusting to expect of his gf.", "OP didn't list any amounts in the initial post and that's weird. Feels like he's obscuring the cost. I'm curious to see if there's a huge disparity in the amounts he's proposing. \n\nI had the same question as you about the cost of electricity, water and internet add up to the same price as previous rent. And why that's equal or equitable to paying for groceries for 2.", "Disagree, I think even in bf/gf situations setting up some legal protections is very smart.  You don\u2019t need to charge the same, but still be smart", "How is expecting someone to contribute treating them like a tenant?", "I doubt groceries for two people costs more (or even equal) to the electric, water, and internet though", "If you\u2019re eating out everyday/food delivery. The gf seems frugal already so it\u2019s not like groceries would be dramatic increase. OP is really taking advantage of his gf by acquiring a tenant.", "I think it's really interesting that OP didn't give any amounts, at least not in the main post. Something's weird about that.", "And chances are she would end up doing the majority of the housework because of how things tend to work out when you move in with a man.", "Yep, and two people living in a home will make the water and electric bill go up too. My point is, she's not financially benefiting from moving in with him, and he is. If she was just a roommate, then yes, this works be an appropriate request. But she's his partner. She should be treated as such.", "I also think that is his point but we don't know how groceries compares to the bills.\n\nINFO: what would be the total of the monthly bills and how much do you estimate spending on groceries per person each month?", "They didn't say that. They quoted someone and said \"exactly\" and then continued.", "The number of bills is irrelevant, the amount they add up to is.", "No. I read reddit and see this pretty regularly but sure, go off lol.", "Because he's special, and he only responds to other special ones that agree with him.\n\nMy last comment was removed because I was brutally honest.", "That greatly depends on where you live.", "Yes, I'm not saying that 2k on food a month is normal for two people, but it also depends on what you eat. We don't eat filet mignon every night, but we also aren't eating Top Roman either. Our food bill for my wife and I is about 1k a month. Let alone eating out and food delivery! We probably spend 2k+ amonth on food!", "Idk what you buy, so I can't speak to what you spend! We spend probably 1k on groceries and 1k eating out and getting food delivered. For me and my wife Electric at worst is $400 a month (in the summer) water, sewer, and trash is labout $150 a month and internet is about $150 you can't rent a 1 bed in most place for $700 a month", "It's not overspending, you don't dictate how people should eat.", "Most likely, I do alot of baking and cooking. But on the flip side we don't go out to eat, we don't go to Starbucks or buy stuff at the vending machine at work. But even on the weeks I don't buy a lot the cost is still noticable. Or when I watch a parent with kids pulling a cart full of groceries I just cringe because I am mentally adding the cost in my head. \nDownside of living near Seattle, wonderful and beautiful area but expensive.", "It's the opposite for me, in season fruit and veg is the cheapest part of the docket. Anything processed or meat is where the bulk of my groceries expenses are. Referring to food only. If I need any cleaning or hygiene staples it gets really expensive really fast.\n\nGroceries in general are really expensive at the moment and everything is going up, but it's mostly things like bread, eggs, meat and snack foods.\n\nI'm in Australia for reference."]}
