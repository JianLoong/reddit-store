{"id": 6533, "submission_id": "103t40f", "title": "AITA for moving out of my in-laws' place with my kid?", "selftext": "Some background: My (34F) husband (37M) passed away last year (sudden death, no illness) and I didn't have a place of my own. I stayed with my in-laws, thinking that they'd lost their son and being with their grandchild (5M) would help them while grieving. My original plan was to stay until a year passed by since his death and I tied up some loose ends as far as my husband's debt was concerned. In the meantime, my in-laws kept escalating their complaints against me - that I didn't wake up early (I have to commute 75-90 minutes to my workplace and I wake up by 6.30-7 am), that I didn't take care of my son (I'm now a single parent and I cannot be with him through the day, since I have to work), that I don't do all the housework (I take care of the laundry, look after my son when I'm at home (includes keeping on top of his school schedule, take him out to activities weekly, read with him), clean everyday, and help with cooking whenever I am home).\n\nLast week, things escalated. I visit my parents with my son every other weekend and my in-laws kept saying he always fell sick whenever he came back to their (in-laws) place and that he keeps losing weight whenever he visits my parents. Now, he's a 5-year-old who is back in school after two years of a pandemic. He gets a cold twice a month, a mild temp every three-four months. He has some genetic allergies and that is all being addressed with his doctors. His weight, according to his doctors, is perfectly within range and he has met all his developmental goals on time, if not earlier. After last week's visit, over the New Year, they started singing the same tune. I texted my parents and told them I don't want to be there anymore.\n\nI packed up a few necessities, took my son and left for my parents'. I'm looking for a place of my own near my folks and hope to move in to a house soon. The in-laws are now calling me and my parents to yell at us, to call me a bad mom, to say I'm selfish, etc. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I see a lot of comments on grandparents' rights, CPS, etc. This isn't the US, and the law here favors biological parents unless the situation is extremely concerning. But yes, I understand what y'all are saying. I have all my son's medical records, evidences of my good (well, half-decent, I guess) parenting and other such things. I also think their behavior is more to do with their grief than any devious scheme to take my son away from me, although that may be my na\u00efvet\u00e9.

Take it easy and do what you need to do.", "NTA. Whatever you do you are never going to please them. They are making an incredibly difficult situation even worse for you.", "NTA\n\nDo these people somehow hold the passing of their son against you or are they just generally awful? I think it would be really bad for your son to continue to watch you constantly be berated. It sounds like your parent's home is a much healthier environment ironically.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I\u2019m sorry for the inexcusable behavior of your in laws. I realize that they\u2019re grieving the loss of their son, but that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to take it out on you and treat you the way they have. You did the right thing by leaving. You and your son both deserve a safe place to call home, to figure things out, and to be able to work through your own grief process.\n\nAlso, based on their accusations and past behavior, I would be very concerned about what they might do in the future. They strike me as the type of people who might try to sue for grandparents\u2019 rights or custody out of spite, grief, anger, or in a desperate attempt to hang on to the memory of their son by trying to take yours. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to speak with an attorney to protect both you and your son. Keep track of everything. Their emails, texts, vm\u2019s or any other kind of communication, especially those with threats and accusations. Write down dates, times, and locations. Keep copies of your son\u2019s medical records to show that he\u2019s in good health should they file claims with authorities. I truly hope I\u2019m wrong and this never happens, but if it does, you can be prepared and ready for whatever may happen.", "NTA\n\nThey should be happy you are gone.", "NTA\n\nDo what feels right by you and your son. That is your priority and not to satisfy every whim of your in-laws", "NTA\n\nUltimately, you should do what's best for you and your son. Feel sorry for them if you want, but don't let their grieving overwhelm you.", "NTA it doesn\u2019t sound like you could win with them no matter what you did. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss because that\u2019s utterly heartbreaking.

They\u2019re not happy with you leaving. They won\u2019t be happy whatever you do.\n\nSo do what makes *you* happy. Happier, at least. Take care of yourself and your son.\n\n(And write down everything - EVERYTHING - they say and do that is manipulative or designed to give them control.)", "Definitely NTA. Yikes. Glad you're getting out of there.", "NTA. Your son will also benefit from distance to such a toxic environment.", "NTA \n\nYou tried to help them with their grief and get them to hell you with your grief. \n\nBut it failed. \n\nAlso sounds like they really want custody of your child and are setting you for a CPS visit. \n\nI would sadly be keeping them away from your child for the near future. \n\nGive yourself some time to heal and sort yourself out.", "NTA\n\nYou don't need them trying to beat you down.   Glad you're with your family.  Sorry for your loss.", "Deffinitely NTA. \n\nBut just consider that some states have grandparent rights. (Not sure what they're called). Like since your husband passed away,  some states allow grandparent to file for visitation rights of sorts. Especially since you lived with them so they have a relationship and aren't just estranged grandparents. I know moving out doesn't neccessarily mean you'd never let your son see them, but just a warning because based on how they talk to you- I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled something like this. Especially if you moved out and they felt that you're an awful mother as it was.", "NTA. They are dealing with their grief (or maybe with being overwhelmed by responsibility for a five year old) by lashing out at you. Sounds like you moving out is best for everyone, especially if they keep complaining that you aren't pulling your weight! In a worst case scenario, they are actively trying to take custody of your son from you.\n\nThat commute is REALLY long with a young kid, though-- that's three hours commuting every day. I can see why they might have complained that you never saw your son. Maybe it's better to move close to your work and get a babysitter to cover the afternoon hours? \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss and for how much you have to bear right now, OP.\n\nETA: The more I think about this, the more what they complain about makes no sense.
