Our son was born with a birth defect that required surgery last year, which resulted in a week at the hospital to recover and a month of recovery at home. While at the hospital, I would get constant calls and texts 24/7 from my ex asking for updates, which is a normal thing to ask. However, every time I would tell him his response always led to yelling at me for not \u201ctelling him sooner\u201d even if whatever it was had just happened. His thought was that the second I heard a slight change I should be immediately calling him. I never waited longer than a full day to update him, however the calls and texts from him were becoming extremely exhausting. Not to mention I was extremely depressed and overwhelmed during this time. What frustrated me the most was he never made a single attempt to come up to the hospital, or even see him after. \n\nIt\u2019s been a year since then, and due to the damage from the birth defect, our son needs another surgery with the same recovery time. Not once did my ex ever go to any doctors appointments, testing, ect, but would consistently berate me if I did not call him immediately to tell him every detail. So yesterday, I went to pick my son up at his grandmoms (ex\u2019s moms house), and when seeing my ex I reminded him of our sons surgery coming up soon. His first response was that I better \u201cmake sure to constantly call him\u201d and I stopped him mid sentence and told him no. He looked confused, so I explained if he wanted to know what\u2019s going on, he could go to the hospital and ask the doctors himself. He got angry and starting yelling, but I just took my son and went home. Now I\u2019ve gotten a ton of messages from him saying I\u2019m the AH and denying him access to his child, but I\u2019m tired of being the messenger. AITA?\n\nEdit: I should also add that I\u2019m a full time single mom, we never married and have no custody arrangement. I have him 7 days a week 24/7, along with working two jobs and going to college online.

I've been in your shoes, and I'm always shocked that with all of this other stuff going on, my ex wants me to text him.  I'm glad you told him no.

He wants it his way but doesn\u2019t want to actually engage fully!!", "NTA. Unless he's not allowed in the hospital for the surgery due to covid restrictions, there's no reason he shouldn't be present for his son's surgery and recovery. That's just part of being a good dad. \nHeck, my dad was going through chemo and still wanted to be at the hospital for my surgery, and I was an adult. I asked him to stay home because we were worried about him being around so many germs, but he still felt horrible for not being there.\nYour ex doesn't seem to care that he never visited his son, so he doesn't deserve or have a right to expect constant updates. He needs to put in the effort, not expect you to handle it all for him.", "NTA.  Your ex is being unreasonable in putting on you the entire burden of caring for your son and updating him as to your son's condition.  \n\nHowever, I can certainly understand his desire to have frequent updates.  I agree with you that he needs to take some responsibility in this.  I would tell him that you will give him an update once per day at *your* convenience (if you are willing to do this), and if he requires more frequent or timely updates, he is welcome to come to the hospital or even call the hospital and request updates himself.  In most cases there would be someone on the unit, perhaps your son's nurse, who would be willing to speak to the father and provide updates and answer questions.  (Alternately, if there is someone who is supporting you and is more aware of the updates as they happen, perhaps that person would be willing to give your ex updates so you don't have to.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then when he started to become manipulative, controlling, and emotionally abusive, my own image of myself was already extremely low and I truly believed I was always at fault. However once I got pregnant and had our son, I saw how bad things were and couldn\u2019t allow myself to raise our son in an abusive household. I\u2019m still trying to find a healthy balance of co parenting and I have a lot of work to do.", "I should also add as much as I wish I could reduce the contact, his mother helps watch our son while I work and he lives with his mother. I don\u2019t make enough money even with 2 jobs for a sitter, and with my son\u2019s condition is very risky having him in daycare due to how bad he gets if he gets sick. A simply cold is enough to put him in the hospital", "I\u2019m so happy for you that you are out! And it just goes to show that he will use *any* opportunity to continue controlling you. So definitely don\u2019t give him an in. \n\nPeople like him are the worst. Give them an inch and they\u2019ll try to take everything.", "These are good suggestions.

That's awful", "I struggle with that as well. My husband and I came to the decision because it was causing so me so much stress. It wasn't a conversation with my parents. It was literally just..  we stopped giving them information unless absolutely necessary. Please feel free to DM me. It's hard for me to talk about this openly.", "Why does he not pay child support? If he doesn't have a job, you could try applying for TANF which is basically State paid child support. (If you're in the US.) Once you're ex has a job the state will go after him for repayment. Also you should file for child support through your states child support division. Then he will be forced to pay, if not he will go to jail.", "Were I that man's mother, that shit wouldn't fly with me.

If dad can\u2019t be there and demands real time notes, he needs to help. Is he giving a ride? Bringing meals? Arranging for post-op care? No? Then leave him to exercise his rights or not, not add to your to-do list. You\u2019re the only one caring for your son\u2019s medical needs and your son needs your attn, not the dad.

He has access if he\u2019s at the hospital\n\nNTA", "NTA So he cared enough to berate you but doesn\u2019t care enough to be with your son and definitely not enough care to provide financially. He can pop in and out of the little boy\u2019s life and not for a second feel less of a father for not helping out. The medical bills likely are a killer and he doesn\u2019t even give you money to help cover. He sounds like the type that would refuse to give up his rights to another adult who actually steps up to the plate to help you co parent. Your child deserves more than what he\u2019s receiving from your ex.", "Question, is your ex on your son's paper work as someone the doctors can give information to? If not then yeah you are denying him access. \n\nPossible NTA", "NTA \nGive him the nurses desk number, he can call himself to get updates.", "NTA and you are correct.  Dad can miss work & worry sitting in the hospital for hours & days, if he really cares about this child.  Not your responsibility to keep him informed.

You are working 2 jobs and caring for your son - and he can\u2019t even work one?!? As for you, NTA of course. Don\u2019t let him bully you. Like all bullies, he sounds like a total baby.

Best of luck with your baby", "You need to get h in court ASAP and get child support", "And see if grandma can go to your place rather than the other way around. The son is *two* and he's avoiding his father. That's extremely telling of his behavior and is not normal. See if he's genuinely feeling ill or if it's an excuse. If he is feeling sick, he probably is or has developed anxiety that's triggered by being around his father and that should be brought up with the doctor as early intervention is important. Kids don't say \"I'm anxious\" they say \"I have a tummy ache.\" A solid custody agreement needs to be in place before he tries to block OP from seeing him, since as others have said, this is all about control, and lots of toxic people leverage the kids as a way to control their ex", "This! \u261d\ufe0f I came to find out if this has been addressed \u2014 what\u2019s MILs stance in all this?", "NTA.  You need to be focusing on your child who is in the hospital, not constantly updating another adult who could also come to the hospital to focus on his child as well (but just chooses not to).  \n\nHis choice not to come to the hospital to monitor his son himself does not translate to you becoming his personal assistant to answer his every beck & call immediately.  I\u2019d turn the phone off while you\u2019re at your child\u2019s bedside.

It belongs to your child. It's your child's RIGHT to have at least financial support. Even if all you do is use it to ease the financial burden on yourself so that you can be fully present and better rested to take care of your child. Good luck OP.

It was tough but it didn't kill us (Son is now 24).   The most important lesson was we needed to be fair to each other.  Seems to me he wants to dictate what happens without actually showing up.   He needs a couple of nights sleeping on the floor of his sons hospital room to get his perspective back to reality.  And he needs to lose the anger.  It's okay to be angry and that could be dealt with away from the kid and you, blowing up at you solves nothing except depletes your strength that you need to be your son's primary.
