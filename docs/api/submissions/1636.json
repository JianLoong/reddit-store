Our son was born with a birth defect that required surgery last year, which resulted in a week at the hospital to recover and a month of recovery at home. While at the hospital, I would get constant calls and texts 24/7 from my ex asking for updates, which is a normal thing to ask. However, every time I would tell him his response always led to yelling at me for not \u201ctelling him sooner\u201d even if whatever it was had just happened. His thought was that the second I heard a slight change I should be immediately calling him. I never waited longer than a full day to update him, however the calls and texts from him were becoming extremely exhausting. Not to mention I was extremely depressed and overwhelmed during this time. What frustrated me the most was he never made a single attempt to come up to the hospital, or even see him after. \n\nIt\u2019s been a year since then, and due to the damage from the birth defect, our son needs another surgery with the same recovery time. Not once did my ex ever go to any doctors appointments, testing, ect, but would consistently berate me if I did not call him immediately to tell him every detail. So yesterday, I went to pick my son up at his grandmoms (ex\u2019s moms house), and when seeing my ex I reminded him of our sons surgery coming up soon. His first response was that I better \u201cmake sure to constantly call him\u201d and I stopped him mid sentence and told him no. He looked confused, so I explained if he wanted to know what\u2019s going on, he could go to the hospital and ask the doctors himself. He got angry and starting yelling, but I just took my son and went home. Now I\u2019ve gotten a ton of messages from him saying I\u2019m the AH and denying him access to his child, but I\u2019m tired of being the messenger.

He can get up at 4AM to get the kid to the hospital (I know the arrival hours usually suck). Then he can sit in the lobby all day waiting for the surgery. Plus spend days and nights. Sitting in the room. Waiting for the various specialists to march through. With their gaggle of lesser doctors.\n\nIf he isn\u2019t doing all that. He can damn well wait for you to send him an email. Whenever you feel like it.\n\nEdit: set up a new email address. Tell him you will send emails when you get a chance. Tell him you\u2019ll be blocking his calls, texts and emails. That the new address won\u2019t accept replies. \n\nThen set the new email address to auto reply that the address doesn\u2019t accept emails. Whenever he tries to send a response to an update.", "NTA - you are not denying him access to his child but in the end, it\u2019s not about your child at all. He\u2019s upset because it\u2019s about control over you. No amount of time would have been fast enough because he sounds like his only objective was to berate you.\n\nIf it was about his son, he would have shown up for anything, even once, but especially the surgery(s).", "Absolutely NTA. Having a kid sick is hectic, scary, busy, overwhelming... you have the right to compartmentalize. If he wants updates he can either deal with them as you have the time and energy to give them and POLITLY or he can take his azz to the hospital and get them himself.", "NTA - So happy for you that this man is your ex.", "NTA \n\nYou are taking care of your child and he is \u201cfaking\u201d that he cares.\nAsk him several times to take a child to the doctor when there is appointment several days prior etc. \u201cby message\u201d. You will have proof when it\u2019s needed if he refuse, if he admits and actually go it is win anyway.", "NTA\n\nHe is responsible for his own information. You have enough on your plate without catering to your EX. He knows your son is having surgery and the date. He can figure it out from there.\n\nIf you are felling generous you could send 1 text after surgery. \u201cSurgery is over. Son did great.\u201d", "Nta. He is attempting to control the situation and you even after the breakup. If he wants to see his son, he can do it. \n\nYou\u2019re 100% right for putting your foot down. You can tell him that you will update him MAX once a day and give him the phone numbers of the doctors and all info for the surgery so be can keep himself updated. \n\nHe isn\u2019t angry about you denying him access to his son. He\u2019s angry that you aren\u2019t complying to his exact requirements. He must have been a real gem when you were together.", "NTA, it doesn't sound like he actually cares about your son's well-being, but he just wants to control you/have an excuse to berate you.", "NTA I have been in a similar situation. And I said finally I will update people when I can and as necessary. If you want to up to the minute information, come to the hospital. It's exhausting.", "NTA \n\nYour were  correct to tell him that. He can come to the hospital.  He can contact the doctor. He can make his choices.\n\nYou aren't denying him anything. You have chosen to remove one unnecessary, unwanted stressor from your life at a stressful time.\n\nHopes for a successful surgery and thourogh recovery. Keeping you and your son close to my heart.", "NTA.\n\nYour ex got a lot of frigging nerve.", "NTA you did the opposite of denying him access by reminding him of the surgery (which clearly wasn\u2019t on his radar) and inviting him to go to the hospital. He is intentionally making this more stressful on you while trying to convince himself he is a \u2018good father\u2019 that cares. If he cared he would be at the appointments he would be at the hospital and he would know what\u2019s going on as it happens. You are dealing with so much stress and uncertainty without adding his nonsense in. Good luck on the surgery!", "NTA\n\nYou are going through an incredible amount of stress with your son's surgery. Your main focus needs to be your son, and yourself. If he wants the play by play as it happens, he can organize to be there himself or at least have a family member stand in for him.", "NTA.  I've been in your shoes, and I'm always shocked that with all of this other stuff going on, my ex wants me to text him.  I'm glad you told him no.  You are denying him access, if it wants access, he can come to the hospital.  Sounds like a manipulative AH to me.", "NTA!!!  Your ex is playing arm chair quarterback. He wants it his way but doesn\u2019t want to actually engage fully!!", "NTA. Unless he's not allowed in the hospital for the surgery due to covid restrictions, there's no reason he shouldn't be present for his son's surgery and recovery. That's just part of being a good dad. \nHeck, my dad was going through chemo and still wanted to be at the hospital for my surgery, and I was an adult. I asked him to stay home because we were worried about him being around so many germs, but he still felt horrible for not being there.\nYour ex doesn't seem to care that he never visited his son, so he doesn't deserve or have a right to expect constant updates. He needs to put in the effort, not expect you to handle it all for him.", "NTA.  Your ex is being unreasonable in putting on you the entire burden of caring for your son and updating him as to your son's condition.  \n\nHowever, I can certainly understand his desire to have frequent updates.  I agree with you that he needs to take some responsibility in this.  I would tell him that you will give him an update once per day at *your* convenience (if you are willing to do this), and if he requires more frequent or timely updates, he is welcome to come to the hospital or even call the hospital and request updates himself.  In most cases there would be someone on the unit, perhaps your son's nurse, who would be willing to speak to the father and provide updates and answer questions.  (Alternately, if there is someone who is supporting you and is more aware of the updates as they happen, perhaps that person would be willing to give your ex updates so you don't have to.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then, I'd block his number until you get your son home. Alternately, you could tell him to only contact you through your lawyer.", "NTA. I am assuming the hospital your son is attending does not have a  limit on parents staying/visiting while a minor had surgery? He could go to the hospital and be there for his child during this time. He choose not to. If he sons health mattered to him that much, he would be there. \n\nI wouldn't worry about taking his calls os keeping him informed. You will have enough stress on you.", "NTA it is about controlling you and berating you as an emotional punching bag, not wanting updates on his child.", "You should move to have all communication with your ex be directed through the state's child support communication channel.\n\nNTA. And this time I wouldn't give him any updates at all. You don't work for him. He can call the hospital and wait.", "NTA. \n\nSend him a text message- for proof- reminding him of the day, time and surgery location. Add in \"If you aren't there, I will try to provide you and others updates, but will not be able to give a lot of updates because I will be with our son, or speaking to the doctors, or just not on my phone much.\"\n\nThat way you have a nice, polite, but firm text message about expectations. Will this make him suddenly rational? No, but it is good for a judge to see if he creates an issue there, or for family who may reach out and give you a hard time. Plus, you will not feel guilty when you don't update him all the time, because you told him what to expect, and like you said, if he is so worried, he can be there. \n\nThen, the day of the surgery, do not let him upset you or take you away from your son, or just when you are having a quiet moment and don't want to deal with him. You will send him the updates you send everyone- in surgery, out of surgery, doctor summary, etc.", "NTA.  He has access to the same medical info you have. That doesn't require a middleman, all you need to do is inform him of surgery and doctor appointments that you make. He can be there or get updates through the doctor, same as you. You are not restricting access in any way I can see", "Nta. He has an obligation to be there and talk to the Dr's himself. You are not his secretary so you don't need to act like one. \n\nDocument you telling him about the surgery and inviting him to appts but that's the end of your obligation. The rest is on him.", "Good lord, I see why he's your EX!  What a dick.\n\nNTA", "NTA - again invite him the hospital where he will have unlimited access, what he doesn\u2019t have access to is you. Block him.", "He doesn't even need to go to the hospital to get updates. Instead of being on the phone trying to harass OP, all he needs to do is just call the hospital. \"I'm so and so's dad. How are they doing? Can you update me if there are any changes?\"", "Set up an email address or use one of those messaging apps that families with court custody agreements use.", "Absolutely this.\n\nI think it also gives the ex the ability to act like HE is the victim in all this. I can just hear him tearing OP down to his friends and family and acting like he is the one being harmed here. He's not actually concerned about his son; he's very concerned about being perceived as concerned, because he can manipulate that to get attention.", "This.  \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb. My first thought - this is about her, and control over her.  Nothing to do with his child.  OP, you are doing nothing wrong, this is a good boundary to set.  Your ex is an AH.", "WTF. THIS right here. Ex has the audacity to complain about \"denying access' to his child when OP's told him he NEEDs to make an effort to be involved and show up to the hospital and his doctor's appointments etc. OP, you've established your boundary, please stick with it. Ex can either wait for updates when you're ready to provide them OR he can actually become involved. I can see why he's an ex. NTA at all.", "NTA\n\nEven updating a supportive, loving partner and/or  family can be draining when medical treatment is underway.\n\nDecide how often and how you want to update ppl. This can be anywhere from \"not at all\" to \"hourly\". \n\nAnd, doesn't your son have other people who care about him who deserve the updates more than this guy who just yells?\n\nIf (IF) you decide to update your ex, don't do calls. Just text. Or text his mom. It sounds like she has an actual relationship with her grandson.", "NTA.\n\nIf he really wanted to know what was going on, he'd be in the waiting room. He'd be attending appointments, he'd be talking to you about next steps. \n\nHe does not care about your child. He is using your child's illness to abuse and control you. He deserves not one more word from you.", "Can you go through one of the parenting apps that courts often require? Because it doesn't sound like your ex is very involved in your (as in both of yours) child's life. You are the one taking the full emotional brunt of your child's medical issues. If ex cared at all, wouldn't they at least be at the hospital once?", "NTA. Tell him the actual child needs your full attention, not the overgrown one. Your boundary is reasonable. It's his demands that are unreasonable. Good on you for shutting that down. The bit about \"denying him access to his child\" doesn't even make sense. You didn't bar him from the hospital.", "I have an ex who acted like this about a child that isn't even his, and whom he was indifferent to when it was at all inconvenient for him to do otherwise. It's 100% about control. NTA", "NTA \n\nIf he wants to be in the know he can talk to the doctors his damn self. It\u2019s ridiculous of him to act like he can\u2019t go to the hospital himself and be a damn parent. Supporting the kid that in the hospital isn\u2019t just moms duty. If work is the reason he can be there fine but that shouldn\u2019t stop him from visiting and talking to the doctors himself.

You aren't denying him access to his child, you LITTERALLY INVITED HIM TO THE HOSPITAL!!!", "You should mute him on your phone during the surgery.", "An ex...calling repeatedly to berate you? \nAn ex?\nDoes he have your life or money? Involve the courts otherwise, retrain him. He starts yelling, drop the call. He does it in front of you, walk away.", "He also yelled in front of the child. He clearly gives a fuck about the child. He just want to make her life harder. \n\nI wonder if he even spend time with his child when it is his time or just his mother? \n\nNTA I would reduce the contact to the absolute minimum. Don't give in his powerplay.", "Yeah, I was going to say that OP should take the custody agreement (back) to court with copies of all his abusive nonsense and request that all communication must be conducted via one of those messenger apps that automatically logs and sends a copy of the message to the court."]}
