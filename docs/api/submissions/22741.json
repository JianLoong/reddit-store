The family is blowing up with drama right now because of what I (and my wife) did. I must preface this by saying my family can be pushovers, they really all hate conflict and will definitely let themselves be run over by someone else in order to not cause a fight. I am not this way. \n\nThe wedding was on Saturday. Catholic ceremony in a church that was at 3:30 PM. The reception area was at a brewery about 15 minutes from the church. The reception was set to start at 5. Maybe this was stupid on the venue people, but they wouldn\u2019t open the bar or bring around the appetizers until the bride and groom arrived. \n\nService ended around 430 and everyone was told to go to the reception. The wedding party had a limo to take them and a separate limo took the parents, grandparents, siblings. The couple is young and decided against family in the wedding party lol. It was 4 sorority sisters and fraternity brothers on each side.  My wife and I drove. We got to the venue around 4:50 with the first family limo arriving around that time. By 5 I\u2019d say all 150 guests were there..but no bride and groom. The wedding coordinator was getting *pissed* as it\u2019s now 5:45 and no wedding party. We are all just standing around with no food or drinks. \n\nSomeone was able to get ahold of the MOH around this point and apparently the bride and groom told the limo driver to stop at a liquor store and then drive around on the highway for an hour so the wedding party could get trashed. At around 6 the MOH said they should be arriving in the next 20 minutes. \n\nMy wife and I looked at eachother and said we are out. We thought it was horribly disrespectful for them to do that to all their guests. I told my brother (FoB) that we were leaving and taking the gift with us. He tried to plead by saying \u201cthey\u2019re just kids let them have fun\u201d but I was having none of it. \n\nA few days after, I got an apology text from niece followed by an ask for the gift again. I said that I felt very disrespected and I didn\u2019t want to give a gift anymore. She snapped and called me an asshole.", "created_utc": 1689868782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154uy67/aita_for_leaving_my_nieces_wedding_reception/", "score": 10024, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The real issue is the bar not being open and no food available so the guests are sat twiddling their thumbs. \n\nThe way the OP has told the story makes him sound n-t-a, but I'm not sure it was a taking the gift away situation. Bit tacky of his niece to say sorry and then ask for the gift back too.", "NTA - What about the parent\u2019s of the \u2018happy couple\u2019? If a child of mine pulled this I\u2019d be livid and embarrassed and demanding they appear at the reception ASAP!\n\nETA: Seems like a lot of wedding couples forget that everyone is their GUEST!", "NTA\n\nI got married at 22, mostly had friends in our wedding party, and took time for pictures between the ceremony and reception.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what cocktail hour is for. Not for running around town, getting trashed, and ditching all your guests with nothing to drink/do.\n\nThey are certainly young, but if they\u2019re \u201cjust kids\u201d then maybe they aren\u2019t mature enough to get married. And you didn\u2019t stop them from doing what they want, you just stopped waiting for them to grace you with their presence.", "NTA but y bother taking the gift back . Just move on.", "NTA. We own a venue and sometimes offer all-in packages wherein I arrange almost everything. One of the first things I tell the couple is that their guests should always have something to eat and drink while waiting for them. \n\nThese people have sacrificed time and money to be there on their special day, the least they could do is to keep them fed and to at least try to make it enjoyable for everyone involved.", "ESH. Obviously Bride and Groom suck. Your supposed to\nBe the mature 45 yr old adult. Leave the venue, express your opinion to your brother, but just leave the gift. What they did was definitely AHish but you made it so much worse by acting like a child here.", ">He tried to plead by saying \u201cthey\u2019re just kids let them have fun\u201d\n\nTell your brother kids shouldn't be getting married. It's for adults.\n\nNTA OP\n\nVery tacky and entitled of niece to ask for a gift after making all the guests wait for almost 2 hours. She should be embarrassed and apologize to everyone for such rude behaviour.\n\n Though I want to know OP were you and your wife the only ones who left the reception early ?", "NTA.  Niece only apologized because she wanted the gift. What a pair of brats. Don't worry.  This won't last a year. Neither is mature enough to be married. It would have been a waste of a gift.", "NAT that is ridiculous and I would\u2019ve done the same thing", "NTA only because the bride & groom didnt build in that getting trashed time. It\u2019s fine if you wanna bar hop or do shots, but then have the wedding at 2:30 instead. \n\nAlso what a stupid rule to not serve food or drinks while the guests are waiting. That\u2019s super shitty of the restaurant (and wasnt there a separate bar you could order from). This was definitely organized by a dumb 22 yr old. Tell her you\u2019ll give her her present at her next wedding. \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffe", "I\u2019m dying that she\u2019s asking for the gift. \nSave it for the second wedding.", "Nta\n\n\nI gotta love the excuse because they are kids.\n\n\nDude, they are literally old enough to marry. They are old enough to know you don't keep guests waiting an hour plus.\n\n\nIf you can't respect those closest to you, then you can freak off.\n\n\nWhat the couple did was flat out wrong. Because they wanted to get drunk. \n\nAlso, the gift wasn't in the couples' custody.  You can learn some manners before I spend a dime on you. The only reason the niece even apologized was because she wanted the gift.\n\nFinally, this couple will be divorced within 2 years. They sound immature.  Have no sense of responsibility or manners.", "Well they act like children. I'm surprised if not all guest walked out with their presents", "NTA! So you mean to tell me you and everyone else were expected to wait 90+ minutes with nothing to drink or eat, sitting there hoping they would show up eventually? Oh hell no! Did they actually show up in that next 20 minutes? And why would they want to get fall down drunk BEFORE the reception? I just don't understand their thinking at all. Good on you for not rewarding bad behavior!", "NTA\u2026\n\nClearly they have not been taught manners.\n\nThis makes me reflect on my 1st wedding where my MIL agreed to pay the bar tab. She could have paid extra per plate instead of per drink. I told her that was a really bad idea. She stopped paying 1/2 way through and I was so confused that my family started paying cash. \n\nI went up to bar for a glass of wine and I asked a friend why do you have cash out? They said it\u2019s a cash bar now. I was mortified! I asked friend for money cuz I wanted a glass of wine. The bartender laughed and said you are the bride. \n\nI was so embarrassed! It was a small wedding too. I still cringe thinking about it.", "Save the gift for her next wedding. NTA", "NTA. That was incredibly disrespectful.", "Enough AH to go around......The bride and groom most certainly are AH for doing what they did. Her family are AH for making excuses for bad behavior. You and your wife are AH for taking back tour gift.", "NTA for leaving. \n\nINFO: What was the gift/price range? I'm torn over whether taking the gift was petty.", "NTA. But keep the gift. You can give it to her at her next wedding. I give this two years, tops.", "Tough call. Leaving the reception was definitely warranted. In fact I'd have left well before you did. But taking the gift back? That's definitely a dick move. The question is, is it a proportionate dick move to what the wedding party did? Given how little tolerance I have for people who waste my time, I'd say it is. NTA.", "NTA. More than 100 people cleared their day to attend their wedding, and the couple left them hanging because they felt like it.\n\nAnd then asking the gift again.. damn", "The bride and groom sound immature.  Tell your niece you will give the gift at her next wedding.", "NTA\n\n2 hours is completely unacceptable even if food and drinks are being served. The bride showed her lack of maturity having the audacity to ask for the gift back.", "ok I could maaaaaybe say N A H BUT ONLY IF the food was served before they got there. I\u2019m pretty sure most couples take some time to themselves between the ceremony and reception whether it\u2019s for photos or just having a private moment. but yea NTA because if they knew the rules they should have been considerate and at least entered the premises so the food could start and then go have their fun. i would bet that it seems like they would have preferred a super small friends and immediate family only wedding and got roped into invite a load of people by their parents", "Ironic that she called you an a hole.", "NTA. As for the mixed replies re: the gift- I would probably have taken the gift back and replaced it with an envelope containing a $10 bill.", "NTA \n\nIf it was down to them miscalculating time for wedding photography or something then I might feel differently but they were pregaming in the limo and gave zero fucks about their guests. It was incredibly rude of them.", "NTA for leaving assuming you left without making a scene,  but I have my doubts about that.  If you made a scene you are TA for that as well. .  YTA for taking your gift back.\n\nYes your niece was young, stupid and thoughtless. So you had to wait 45 minutes for them to have a little private party with their friends.  You could have spent that time visiting with your family, but you decided it was all about you not being able to get a beer.  \n\n\nEdit:  Went back and read so I did not understand the timing the first time I read it, I thought he said he left at 5:45.  That being said, his sticking around later doesn't change my original thoughts.  NTA for leaving.  AH for taking the gift with him.  Also, if he made a big stink on leaving he is TA as well.", "NTA They played a stupid game and now they don't get any prizes.", "ESH\n\nIt's normal, at least where I am, for there to be a gap between the ceremony and the reception. This is usually filled by a cocktail hour. The niece sucks for not planning something to fill that time and instead just screwing off. She also sucks for asking for the gift again.\n\nThat said, storming off with the gift seems like a huge overreaction to poor planning.", "NTA. Guests come to weddings and bring gifts as a nice thing for the couple, attending a wedding is rarely a treat for anyone. It\u2019s special for the couple and mostly an obligation for the guests. You go because you love and support whoever it is and it\u2019s kind to help them celebrate their love, not because everyone is super into weddings. Drinks and dinner, and the reception, are the \u201cthank you\u201d for the guests for giving their time and money to take part in the couples celebration and giving them a gift for their new life together. If you\u2019re inconveniencing and mistreating them, you\u2019re doing it wrong. If it was 15 or 20 minutes I\u2019d say \u201clet it go, it\u2019s their day,\u201d but two hours was deliberately rude.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m surprised at the amount of people saying you shouldn\u2019t have taken back the gift. The bride didn\u2019t show up to accept it. It\u2019s still yours. I hope they do not convince you to give it to her now. \n\nSave it for her next wedding. There is no way people this immature and selfish can survive a marriage.", "NTA", "Anyone who makes guests wait at a venue for ninety minutes with no food or drinks is rude regardless of their age. NTA.", "NTA I'd be petty and tell your neice she can have the gift at her next wedding, but only if she can be bothered to actually show up for it.", "Well...  ESH.     I don't blame you for leaving, but taking back your gift was poor form.   \n\nYour niece should not have asked for the gift back or called you an asshole.  (and for that matter should not have made her guests waiting).", "NTA, but your niece is.", "Did nobody in the limo have a cell phone? They had to have gotten hammered with calls and texts, and they knew that all their guests were waiting with no food or drinks. NTA. I bet they're divorced within 2 years. Hope they don't have kids right away.", "I was with you until you took the gift back. Who do you think you are? ESH.", "Nta, actions have consequences. Can't leave a party waiting on you for an indefinite amount of time. Personally I would have read the room to see what others thought of the gift situation", "Info - was it at the direction of the couple or the planner or the venue that the bar remained closed during the actual reception?", "NTA. The family should be blowing up the father's phone, for raising such an irresponsible, unmannered child. Telling the limo driver to ride around on the freeway while they got drunk in the limo?! This ain't prom, lol. Never give them a wedding gift, OP, and don't accept any quid pro quo apologies. The audacity! Yikes.", "NTA and I cannot even imagine treating wedding guests this way. GUESTS WAITED AROUND FOR APPROX. 2 HOURS WITH NO FOOD OR DRINKS AFTER THE CEREMONY! This is Crazy!\n\nIt was also completely inappropriate and entitled for your niece to call and ask for your gift.", "NTA. Went to wedding 2 hours drive away. Open bar didn\u2019t start \u201cuntil after the ceremony\u201d on-site, per the bride\u2019s instructions. They started 2 hours late. So no drinks (non-alcoholic/ alcoholic), no food and it\u2019s 7pm. There was some tap water. Couldn\u2019t enjoy myself since I was so peeved. Left as soon as I could. You should have just left the gift tho.", "NTA. And don\u2019t listen to the comments saying you should have left the gift. If you do this to your guests who are wasting time and money to be there for your special day, they\u2019re more than within their right to decide you don\u2019t deserve something you spent money on. Anyone saying otherwise obviously shares the same maturity and self centered selfishness these two did.", "I\nBahaha... she asked for her gift back.  Tacky\n\n\"\"Maybe this was stupid on the venue people, but they wouldn\u2019t open the bar or bring around the appetizers until the bride and groom arrived.\"\"\n\nThis was the decision of bride and groom ..\nThey are paying the venue and caterer,  so they decide when or if serving appetizers  and peividing punch or wine before dinner\n\nNTA\n\nEDIT..  sometimes after wedding  photos  take an hour,  so guests are provided with appetizer and drinks before  wedding party returns  and dinner begins.", "NTA. Was taking the gift back petty? Probably. But the type of petty I can endorse. What's the old saying? Fuck around and find out.", "NTA.\n\nWhy did they need to get drunk on the way to a bar??", "ESH \u2014 if guests had been served at the reception venue, I wonder if OP still would have taken back the gift out of principle of the bride and groom not being there. A lot of pettiness on both sides.", "If they are \u201cjust kids\u201d then they should just throw a party on a Saturday night, not have a wedding. If you wanna do adult stuff then act like one. NTA", "I'm so confused, customs where you all are must be different than here.\n\nWhere I live, folks who have an hour and a half wait between the two don't go over to the reception right away and just - wait. Not unless an invitation specifically states there's food and drink while the wedding party does photos etc. We go and grab fast food or stop for a drink somewhere or even pop home and rest, then show up to the reception. And, when folks are late even after that,we wait, because it's something that happens once or maybe twice in a lifetime. We chat and socialise. We've taken care of ourselves for an hour and a half or more and can wait. If it's super off for some reason, often it means exhausted folks leave after dinner before the dance and drinks. But no one has a fit and takes back their gifts and leaves. \n\nSo to me and our norms here YTA, but I also get if it's not the norm for where you're from we wouldn't lean on my judgement \ud83e\udd37", "NTA", "Lol NTA. Pull that shit in my family they'd have walked into an empty venue with an empty gift table. How rude and self-absorbed. They should've at least let the venue take care of their guests while they had their little pregame limo party.", "NTA. Anyone that's planned a wedding (in NA at least) knows the appetizers are for the guests, not the party. My wife and I picked out great appetizers, we didn't get to eat any of them. They were there for our guests as we did pictures. If you have to leave your guests waiting at the reception for more than 30 minutes, give them food and drinks. Them fucking off to pregame their own wedding reception is fucking wild too. Like no one would be buying them drinks, or they don't have speeches and shit. I don't blame you at all dude.", "NTA for leaving, but YTA for taking back a gift.\n\nYour niece also sounds entitled since her apology was only about  receiving a present.", "NTA, but perhaps everyone (except the groom) will get another chance at a subsequent wedding because these two currently sound too immature for adulthood.", "NTA. Gifts are an entrenched custom but not absolutely mandatory. It\u2019s a faux pas to not bring one but keeping guests waiting for an hour plus without refreshments while a small group get schnonkered in the limousine is an epic level faux pas. There was a bar with beverages that were already paid for waiting for the wedding party to show up so it\u2019s not like they couldn\u2019t get their drink on. Asking about a gift is also pretty rude. Personally, I would have left the gift because it\u2019s not worth arguing about it but that just like my opinion, man. OTOH, if my blood sugar was low, I might not be so logical.", "NTA.  That was very rude and disrespectful, and tacky as fuck.", "NTA\n\nYou waited for a hot minute and they purposefully put a rule in place about food and drinks\n\n\nWhat if there was someone with an illness or a condition?\n\nNow, you COULD have left the gift, but the petty in me says you didn't have to.", "NTA- letting people stand around for 2 hours so you can get trashed? I would have taken the check back too and used the money to go have a nice dinner somewhere. They prioritized getting wasted over the comfort of their guests.", "NTA. That was very disrespectful to the guests and I would have left too. \n\nI am curious what the gift was. If it wasn't super extravagant I would have left it. But if we're talking serious $$$ I understand.", "NTA, I was barely 20 years old when I got married and I would NEVER have done that to my guests. If they wanted to goof off with their friends that's what bachelor/Bachelorette parties are for. The audacity of asking for the gift after the fact is beyond me. They're not \"kids\" and you don't owe them anything", "\u201cWe have 150 people we\u2019re supposed to love and care about, but let\u2019s leave them for an hour, thirsty and hungry, and go to the liquor store and get trashed like the trailer park trash we are.\u201d\n\nNTA. This type of juvenile behaviour should not be rewarded. I love how her tone went from apologetic to ape shit crazy in seconds. She\u2019s not sorry. She\u2019s only sorry about the loss of funds. I hope you were going to give her a great gift or a ton of cash.", "NTA -   If they wanted to do pix between wedding and reception (which is still somewhat rude) , they should have told everyone, reception at 6.  This is on the bride and groom, NOT the venue", "ESH based on this info, but the fact she wanted no family in the wedding party tells me there's more going on here than just this situation.", "NTA, It was reasonable for you to take your things and leave after that disaster. It was incredibly rude to make their guests wait an hour and a half for them. Your niece sounds like an obnoxious entitled teenager for throwing a tantrum about not getting a fucking gift. That's something I can see an 8 year old doing.", "NTA\n\nYour niece made it very clear that her wedding guests only mattered as props for her to be the center of attention and material or monetary value.", "NTA", "NTA that\u2019s crazy of the venue, wedding planner, parents of the disrespectful couple, wedding party and the horrible couple. I seriously doubt the couple paid for the venue and as a pissed off parent I\u2019d told them to start serving after all the guests arrived. Return the gift and get your money back.", "NTA we were late to our reception for similar reasons but we had an open bar and apps for the guests. They didn\u2019t care.", "If the bride and groom didn't realise the reception hadn't opened the bar or provided food, this is a little rude but I'll go NAH as it is their wedding day. It could be NTA if they did know and didn't care.", "NAH other than the venue. You probably should have left the gift but honestly let the couple enjoy their wedding day, it's stressful as fuck for them without extra pressure. The venue was asking for trouble and probably caused a huge rush to the bar when they eventually showed up.", "NTA  \nI'm surprised that half the guests hadn't left by then. To leave everyone standing around for an hour and a half is inexcusable.   \nDoes it get any more rude than calling and asking for a wedding gift??", "NTA - they were disrespectful to all their guests and don\u2019t blame you one bit for leaving with your gift.\n\nWonder how many of the guests left rather than waiting that long for the couple and party to arrive?\n\nDuring that time, they were the only ones to have access to the liquor as the venue wouldn\u2019t serve without the bride and groom.\n\nWhy do people make attending a wedding such a chore?", "NTA", "NTA. And good for you for taking the gift back!", "[deleted]", "ESH - I don't understand the venue not starting service. When I got married we set up and paid for service to start at a set time and it would've started with it without us. Most weddings I've been to the cocktail reception starts pretty soon after the ceremony because the couple are off doing pictures. There has to have been some miscommunication there.\n\nWalking out and taking the gift...I mean sure, you're well within your rights to do so technically. And I get being tired of waiting, but this whole thing seems to have been a miscommunication and not the couple purposely screwing over their guests. Bride shouldn't have apologized to try to get the gift back then gotten mad when you said no.\n\nI do genuinely wonder if this was a venue screw up though.", "NTA", "YTA for thinking that 5 frat bros and 5 sorority sis's were going to do *anything* remotely classy.\n\nBut I would have done what you did, and hoped others followed", "ESH. \n\nYour niece and her husband for not arranging for refreshments while the guests waited for them and for being tacky enough to ask for the gift back. \n\nYou for taking the gift back in the first place and for the snark about \"no family in the wedding party.\" It's their wedding and they can have whoever they want standing up with them on their day.", "NTA, especially if the gift was money,  gift of money should cover the food and drinks you and your plus one consume, plus whatever amount you deem fit as a gift.  If you got no food and drinks, screw them.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm horrified by all the people suggesting that you did anything wrong by essentially not giving them a gift.\n\nMore specifically: while yes, you used the verbiage of \"taking your gift back\"; you didn't yank it out of their hands, you just didn't feel that someone who treated you like garbage warranted a wedding gift, so you didn't give it to them after all, you just took it home with you.  And if there were any doubt at all about it, the fact that your niece had the absolute unmitigated gall to *call you and ASK FOR A GIFT*, *knowing that the reason she hadn't gotten one was that she'd behaved so abominably towards her own guests*  and then swear at you when you understandably refused erased them completely. \n\nYou don't ask people for gifts. Not ever. Not under any circumstances. So, so tacky. And even tackier considering that the reason you left her wedding and didn't give her one was that she was out behaving like self-centred, drunken trash while you, her invited guest, sat around waiting for her at her own wedding reception that she didn't bother showing up to on time.\n\nNot only are you NTA, I'd venture to say that EVERY SINGLE GUEST should have followed your lead, picked up their gifts (to return to the store), and left before the hosts - who clearly didn't give a shit about anyone except themselves and their handful of childish besties - eventually came staggering through the door at the reception. When people make time and effort to show up to celebrate you and you treat them like shit, you don't get to ask or expect them to give you gifts and stick around to make much of you.", "She.... asked you for the gift?! Oh hell no. That apology was not sincere and she learned nothing.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - HOWEVER, depending on how extravagant the gift, return it, and send them a card with a few buck in it.  The gifts are meant more to support the new couple and not as a entry fee to the reception.  The wedding coordinator or the vendor are to blame for not planning for the appetizers or the bar.  Was the venue told not to open 'open bar', or not to serve at all?  Not to serve is a douchy move, but having a cash bar beforehand seems acceptable.", "NTA\nUrghs, that's why getting married is for grown ups.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I would have probably left the gift I don\u2019t blame you for taking it. What they did was incredibly selfish and disrespectful.\n\nI think the fact that she immediately took back her apology and cursed you out when you didn\u2019t give her the gift speaks volumes about her character. That wasn\u2019t an apology.\n\nI\u2019m assuming the gift was a check?", "NTA\n\nI absolutely would have left too, but I wouldn't have taken the gift back.", "NTA for leaving.  But the gift should gave been left.", "NTA. I would have left too. I probably wouldn\u2019t have told anyone and just left but I don\u2019t see anything you did as being wrong. If she\u2019s getting hung up on the gift like this I would probably be like \u2018ok, I\u2019ll bring your gift over\u2019 and show up with a 30 pack of natural light with some fireball shooters or something else appropriate for someone who wants to live in a frat house. If she didn\u2019t know what the gift was originally, there\u2019s room for some malicious compliance.", "NTA your niece was disrespectful to all of her guests and so you left. She wasn\u2019t there to actually be given the gift so since she never received it, it was still yours to do with what you wanted. I see no problem with you taking a gift you had brought back given the circumstances.", "ESH. The bride and groom were terribly rude oafs, and the parents of the bride should have ordered the venue to go ahead and serve refreshments. I've never heard of a venue that won't serve refreshments until the bride and groom arrive. You're not an AH for leaving. That's totally understandable. But YTA for taking your gift back. A wedding gift isn't a transactional exchange for being fed and entertained at a wedding.  It's a token of love and Good wishes for the couple. And this is your niece! Do you really not want her to have a wedding gift from you? Come on!", "NTA and she\u2019s very rude and entitled.", "Those people are jerks. Wedding gifts aren't guaranteed, and honestly I don't blame you. Who drives around drinking on their way TO a huge party?\n\nJust ludicrous red flag behavior. I mean, they are kids, but this is pretty egregious and crummy.", "NTA - if they wanted to fool around after the wedding that\u2019s their prerogative but withholding food and beverage service to make everyone wait on them like they\u2019re the kind and queen of England was ridiculous. I would have left, too.", "NTA.  I would have left around the 5:15 mark.", "NTA. When I got married we asked the driver to take a longer route to the reception so we wouldn\u2019t arrive before most of the guests. However, the bar was ready and there were snack type things available until dinner. Even with our longer route, we still were at the reception within a half hour of leaving the ceremony. What you described was absolutely unacceptable.", "ESH.

The family is blowing up with drama right now because of what I (and my wife) did. I must preface this by saying my family can be pushovers, they really all hate conflict and will definitely let themselves be run over by someone else in order to not cause a fight. I am not this way. \n\nThe wedding was on Saturday. Catholic ceremony in a church that was at 3:30 PM. The reception area was at a brewery about 15 minutes from the church. The reception was set to start at 5. Maybe this was stupid on the venue people, but they wouldn\u2019t open the bar or bring around the appetizers until the bride and groom arrived. \n\nService ended around 430 and everyone was told to go to the reception. The wedding party had a limo to take them and a separate limo took the parents, grandparents, siblings. The couple is young and decided against family in the wedding party lol. It was 4 sorority sisters and fraternity brothers on each side.  My wife and I drove. We got to the venue around 4:50 with the first family limo arriving around that time. By 5 I\u2019d say all 150 guests were there..but no bride and groom. The wedding coordinator was getting *pissed* as it\u2019s now 5:45 and no wedding party. We are all just standing around with no food or drinks. \n\nSomeone was able to get ahold of the MOH around this point and apparently the bride and groom told the limo driver to stop at a liquor store and then drive around on the highway for an hour so the wedding party could get trashed. At around 6 the MOH said they should be arriving in the next 20 minutes. \n\nMy wife and I looked at eachother and said we are out. We thought it was horribly disrespectful for them to do that to all their guests. I told my brother (FoB) that we were leaving and taking the gift with us. He tried to plead by saying \u201cthey\u2019re just kids let them have fun\u201d but I was having none of it. \n\nA few days after, I got an apology text from niece followed by an ask for the gift again. I said that I felt very disrespected and I didn\u2019t want to give a gift anymore. She snapped and called me an asshole.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We put a stop to that asap, but not before one relative had stormed out in disgust. And I do not blame him.

Also, it\u2019s pretty common for wedding parties to do pictures in between the ceremony and reception- allowing guests to be served while that\u2019s happening is pretty standard. If the bride and groom were unaware that the brewery had this policy, I can see where they wouldn\u2019t be the AHs and it was an honest mistake.

I'm surprised relatives weren't more freaked out, if the couple were supposed to arrive at the same time and didn't for 2 hours, you'd be worried there was an accident or something.", "That\u2019s also fairly common in the US.", "It depends on when/if the Wedding Party is doing pictures.  If they do them before the ceremony, then there's usually no gap.  By the way the reception was supposed to start 30 minutes after the ceremony, I'm assuming that in this case, there wasn't supposed to be an extra stop, so they wanted everything to start when they got there, but it's pretty ridiculous that the staff wouldn't serve, considering it'd put them behind schedule for the rest of the evening.  If it was a catered event, all the food would be sitting in warmers.", "I have never waited either, catholic or not. This whole situation is bizarre.

Like they were avoiding buying drinks at the bar at their own wedding by pregaming in the limo before (honestly not a problem if they didn\u2019t go for a massive joyride while their guests waited for them). And maybe they only booked bar tenders/caterers for a certain amount of time and wanted to make sure they were there for the full amount. Either way they sound like the worst hosts ever", "Yes, and at ours the staff saved us a plate so we\u2019d get to taste the appetizers even though we had our photos during the cocktail hour!

You can do champagne and the meal, of course, after the bride and groom arrive but the bride and groom don't have time for the appetizers anyway. They are purely for the comfort of the guests.

Happened at my wedding.", "The one thing I was bummed about at my wedding is they didn\u2019t set aside a few appetizers for me and my husband.

She actually was left at the altar, poor girl, but even though she was devastated she asked her mom to ask guests if they wanted their gifts back.

The gifts were sent to the bride ahead of time or within a week after the wedding, but there was never a stack of presents at the party itself.\n\nIn the Edwardian era it was traditional to send the wedding gifts ahead of time. All the fancy china and crystal and silverware would be displayed at the bride's home and her friends and family were invited to ooh and ahh over all the loot, but it was considered bad taste to display the gifts at the actual reception.", "Plus, since the couple often leaves directly after the reception to the honeymoon, or at least to a local hotel for the night until they leave for their honeymoon, then someone else has to gather the gifts and transport them.

First you have to arrange volunteers to load your gifts into vehicles, transport them to your home or wherever, unload and place the pile in an available spot. Easy for a disgruntled volunteer to withhold or break a few gifts. I remember dropping one as a volunteer and hearing a resounding crash and tinkling glass.

At a good friend's wedding a guest actually broke into the place where the wedding party got ready and stole jewelry and stuff that the wedding party had stored for helping the bride to get ready also that where the gifts were stored atfer opening.  I was the MOH and I got some antique jewelry which was helluva hard to replace stolen from that room. Was a horrorshow with the bride crying from stress. We had a suspect but decided to not pursue charges for we knew there's nothing the cops can do", "More than you think! Some people will put someone in charge of the gift table all night.  Happened at my sisters wedding (we did not have someone guarding the gifts bc it was all family and friends) my one uncle is an addict and stole quite a bit of cash. Also threw out all the cards and the ones with checks. Thankfully the venues staff altered my parents the next morning. Eventually the money was paid back but it def marred a really beautiful wedding, and gave my parents tons of stress. The venue was at my dads job. It was awful. I would highly recommend having a secure place for gifts to be held. No one wants that stress especially when in our case the day was otherwise perfect.", "Oh man, you gotta go to JUSTNOMIL and read some stories of how a MIL would go through the gifts and cards while the couple went on honeymoons and took all the gifts. There are some truly some really shitty people out there.", "You definitely have, and I wish I'd invited you to mine. Getting all that shit to the house afterwards is awful. You have to (a) lug it to leave at someone else's house temporarily or (b) pile it into your car that is no doubt already crammed to the ceiling with other stuff. In my case, there was a pit bull in there too. \n\nI mean, I loved him desperately, and his death broke me so hard that twelve years later I still have not been able to get another dog, but there is no doubt that you can either set off triumphantly for your honeymoon, or you can pack wedding gifts into a car containing a pit bull. You cannot do both.", "Had other things to do afterwards", "Yeah it\u2019s super weird the venue did this. Maybe they\u2019ve had food run out before? But that\u2019s also kind of on them for not setting a minimum. The whole \u201clet them do what they want, they are paying\u201d ethos in hospitality causes way, way, way more issues than having a defined experience and rules. Sure people push back cause they want what they want, but you aren\u2019t dragging my venues names through the mud cause you actually don\u2019t understand how events and f&b work. My only conclusion is they were trying to control for something but went about it in a really dumb way. And probably could have avoided that by having better minimums or setting expectations better \n\nSorry I have many feelings about this. My first career was in hospitality and I still get too worked up over it (hence why I left)", "Honestly I'm wondering if the bride and groom asked for the cocktail hour to start when they arrived because they didn't want to miss the food?", "Last wedding where I was a groomsman, we were having some photos of just groomsmen done before the wedding. So do this, do that, line up here, line up there. \n\nWelp, they forgot to mention one of the random line ups was THE ACTUAL WEDDING. So we were out of order. Groom was in right place or that would have been awkward. Rest of us, somehow, waited until they did the bride entrance and without a word spoken, shuffled ourselves into the correct order. \n\nBride and groom didn't notice because yanno, nerves and such. \n\nThen additional but less photos after of the entire wedding party.", "Venues will follow the contract specifically so they don't get in trouble with the bride and groom. If the decision was \"wait for the couple\", then the venue waits for the couple. They don't make their own decisions based on what they feel like doing, they are at the mercy of the couple making decisions. If the couple had given a time to start feeding their guests then they would follow that as well.

Literally the only reason I\u2019m *having* a traditional wedding is so I can show my loved ones a good time, and give everyone an excuse to dress up and get together and party. Otherwise I\u2019d just do it at the damn courthouse and save myself some money.", "This is insane to me. I do not understand the point of *inviting* people if you don\u2019t care whether or not they\u2019ll enjoy themselves. If you just want to drink and take photos in fancy outfits you can do that on your own time and save a shitload of money.", "Same. But also we would never have agreed to hold food and drink from guests that showed up at the right time before the wedding party. That can get dangerous the other way tbf.

And the best man and MOH should have ordered some pizzas or something.", "It\u2019s got to be both.

I'm Swedish and I have never heard about it here. I guess there is some truth to the fact that people in the Nordics are both more trusting and more trustworthy.", "I was at a family wedding a couple of years ago and the card box was against the far wall for this exact reason. We (close family) also emptied it periodically and put all the cards into our purses, just in case. You just never know....", "That sounds like an urban legend, though. When I grew up we were told that you shouldn't have an answering machine because burglars would phone, hear that no one was apparently at home and break in. Clearly this didn't happen in real life.", "Yeah like the bride and groom might have expected people to be able to  snack and have drinks, and felt no rush to come back for dinner. \n\nStill sound like a piece of work based on how they responded, but arriving late might have been a pretty innocent mistake.", "Yep.  Good amount of time is 2 hrs between.  With a 1 hr before happy hour at the venue where apps and bar is provided. \n\nAllows the wedding party time to go around and goof off with pictures or hitting up a bar as they\u2019re likely all close friends.  Allows guests time to relax before food and a late night, and any last sec errands, and gives them an excuse to show up early with food and drinks provided before the meal and mingle with people you may not have realized we\u2019re invited and haven\u2019t seen in awhile.", "It's typically priced per person and guaranteed before the event. Regadless of when you serve you're paying the same price. They got charged for OP and his wife whether they left or not.\n\nOf course, opening the bar later does mean it can stay open later and not rack more hours. So a 3 hour open bar that starts at 6pm would go until 9. But if they opened it at 5pm, bride and groom would miss out on an hour or they would have to pay for 4 hours to stay open until 9pm.", "I agree and honestly this would make sense if it was the case. For me Its not really their thought process behind getting drunk and letting loose before the reception that bothers me as much as the couple being ok with their guests waiting for over an hour without the option of ordering a drink (or appetizers if you\u2019re going to have that long of a gap). You would think that a couple that obviously prioritizes getting drunk would understand that other people probably want a drink too.", "Exactly. In my experience I\u2019ve found that this gap is pretty normal and most couples do exactly what you did, take photos with family while the guests drink and mingle until dinner, usually for an hour ish but sometimes longer if they\u2019re offering appetizers during this time. \n\nWhat is unusual and off-putting is not even offering guests drinks for this extended amount of time while the hosts get trashed offsite.", "Dont get me wrong, I did some stupid and selfish shit in my early 20s but I don\u2019t think I could have possibly fucked up this bad. I get wanting to party a bit before the reception but doing it offsite, knowing that your guests, can\u2019t eat or drink until you return and then, knowing this, not returning for over an hour is a whooooole new level of selfish that I hope I never come across", "Lol the checkbook", "Indeed. That\u2019s the whole point of a cocktail hour usually. Let your guests enjoy themselves while they wait for the bridal party to finish their photos.", "Ha my sister, at her first wedding at age 48 did the same to us all. \n\nI, as the MOH choose to huddle in a blanket with my 99 year old shivering auntie. \n\nI refused to take pictures with them. \n\nI caught heat for that, but my auntie got to be warm.", "See what I\u2019m saying?? Lol", "I was literally going to say the same thing. I was in my fraternity brother\u2019s wedding and it was so nice and pleasant.

Would've made them assholes too if it wasn't for a good reason.    \n\nAlso, don't be that person that shits on service providers. Don't blame them for sticking to a schedule designed by assholes; they're just doing what they're asked to do.", "[Like this I\u2019m guessing](https://media.tenor.com/fUvZy_Utm5QAAAAC/parks-and-rrec-money-please.gif)", "Why on earth would they/the venue agree to this? Wrong, wrong, wrong plus poor hospitality!", "I knew it was either really hot or really cold, or he wouldn't have called out the temp.", "The cocktail hour gap also allows for guests to deal with any minor issues that may have popped up - wardrobe malfunction, need to get something for a headache from a corner store, need to do a quick call home to check on the kids, that sort of thing, or just if it takes them longer to get from A to B, like Great Uncle Herbert walks super slow so it takes him forever to get to and from the car.\n\nSince food service at a cocktail hour is flexible, if someone comes a bit late they haven\u2019t missed out on dinner or risked holding things up and don\u2019t have to make an awkward entrance while everyone else is seated and being served.", "well after ensures that you are sending it to a married couple.\n\nHow often do people not follow thru??\n\n<<*What percentage of weddings are Cancelled?*  \n*The average engagement is 12-18 months long and about 20% of all weddings are called off after engagements.

Definitely for the best she didn\u2019t marry someone that would do that to her but how mortifying, especially so young. Well, I\u2019m sure the gifts would be helpful for her in starting her new life and getting moved into her own place!", "I have to agree; when the wedding planner was irate, it was pretty telling.\n\nWhile I agree it's a crappy thing for the staff to make 150 people wait for the bridal party to arrive before serving, it certainly didn't help that no one could make contact with **anyone** from the bridal party.  Had the MOH not picked up, when would the guests/planner hear from them?  When would they be served?  Not wining and dining guests who come to see you married by not being available to make decisions is also rude in and of itself.", "They knew there'd be nothing for the wedding party to eat or drink if they started serving right away.", "My impression was that the wedding planner was pissed at the wedding party fucking off to get drunk for over an hour and no contact.\n\nI suspect that the venue was told to wait for the wedding party to arrive before serving.", "My daughter is getting married this fall and will take pictures after the ceremony. She's scheduled a cocktail hour with apps and drinks during that time before the official reception begins. We're in the U.S. It's only right to do the best for your guests.", "So...\n\n*Forty is sweltering,*\n\nHope that fits in the rhyme scheme you've got going there...  and, *yes*, it does help, thanks!", "I think the bride drove around with the wedding party getting trashed. The guests got nothing.", "Look, I could maybe understand grabbing some tots or cheese sticks since you may not get a chance to eat at the reception. But going to a liquor store and getting trashed? Good lord, were they raised in a barn?", "Or if it would have been a blender.", "Sigh. I wish I could go back and do this. You\u2019re sold a very different picture as a young (especially religious) woman.", "South Indian by any chance?  We have \"Rahu kalam\" and \"Kethu kalam\" with almanacs that predict the auspiscious or inauspicious hours of the day.  I keep forgetting my parents still do that shit when I go to India.", "I have a story that goes with this. My brother got married 8 weeks after my sister. My parents insisted on an open bar, and since they were paying for it, they got their way.  Even though the bride's family traditionally pays for the wedding,  they offered to pay for the open bar at my brother's wedding as well. They gave a certain amount toward the bill, and if there was money leftover, the couple got to keep the difference.\n\nTwo important things to know about this wedding.  One, my new SIL had to have her reception at the country club (my sister's reception was at a normal banquet hall), so the drinks were more expensive. Two, and most importantly,  my grandpa died at the wedding.  Yep, collapsed at the church. Technically, he didn't die until later at the hospital,  but when someone dies at your wedding, people tend to drink a bit more.\n\nAn hour or so into the reception, my other grandpa tried to get a drink, and he was told that the tab had been closed. Nbd, he bought his drink. He mentioned something to my mom, and she went to the bar, not understanding how they could have maxed out the total so quickly. The bartender told her that the tab hadn't been maxed out, it had simply been closed by the bride. My mom told him to open it back up, and he said that he had to be told that by the bride. Even when my mom explained that she would be paying the bill, he said that my SIL had to open it back up.\n\nMy mom grabbed her and essentially dragged her over to the bar. She reluctantly reopened the tab. Turns out she just set a somewhat higher limit. My mom had to make her reopen the tab 2 more times that night. That was over 30 years ago, and things smoothed out eventually, but it was very bumpy for a while.", "My experience is that barn folk/animals are a lot better at sharing.", "I knew what you meant but \u201csnacks (can\u2019t spell it properly)\u201d absolutely sent me lol", "No, it isn't.  The record keeping is how you know to whom you should send a thank you note.  People who don't send those, whether or not they live in trailers, are trash.  Am I to understand that you are able to send them just from memory?", "How the hell did the venue insist on following the SIL's instructions when your mom was clearly in charge of the bill?? Your mom should've just revoked the deal where they got to keep the difference.", "I kept hoping autocorrect would get it for me, and it kept letting me down.", "If you looked a bit further down, I sent a thank-you note as soon as a gift arrived and then when we opened the card box post honeymoon\u2026 I never had a \u201cTally\u201d of who to expect gifts from."]}
