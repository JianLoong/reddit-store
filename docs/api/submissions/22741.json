The family is blowing up with drama right now because of what I (and my wife) did. I must preface this by saying my family can be pushovers, they really all hate conflict and will definitely let themselves be run over by someone else in order to not cause a fight. I am not this way. \n\nThe wedding was on Saturday. Catholic ceremony in a church that was at 3:30 PM. The reception area was at a brewery about 15 minutes from the church. The reception was set to start at 5. Maybe this was stupid on the venue people, but they wouldn\u2019t open the bar or bring around the appetizers until the bride and groom arrived. \n\nService ended around 430 and everyone was told to go to the reception. The wedding party had a limo to take them and a separate limo took the parents, grandparents, siblings. The couple is young and decided against family in the wedding party lol. It was 4 sorority sisters and fraternity brothers on each side.  My wife and I drove. We got to the venue around 4:50 with the first family limo arriving around that time. By 5 I\u2019d say all 150 guests were there..but no bride and groom. The wedding coordinator was getting *pissed* as it\u2019s now 5:45 and no wedding party. We are all just standing around with no food or drinks. \n\nSomeone was able to get ahold of the MOH around this point and apparently the bride and groom told the limo driver to stop at a liquor store and then drive around on the highway for an hour so the wedding party could get trashed. At around 6 the MOH said they should be arriving in the next 20 minutes. \n\nMy wife and I looked at eachother and said we are out. We thought it was horribly disrespectful for them to do that to all their guests. I told my brother (FoB) that we were leaving and taking the gift with us. He tried to plead by saying \u201cthey\u2019re just kids let them have fun\u201d but I was having none of it. \n\nA few days after, I got an apology text from niece followed by an ask for the gift again. I said that I felt very disrespected and I didn\u2019t want to give a gift anymore. She snapped and called me an asshole.", "created_utc": 1689868782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154uy67/aita_for_leaving_my_nieces_wedding_reception/", "score": 683, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The real issue is the bar not being open and no food available so the guests are sat twiddling their thumbs. \n\nThe way the OP has told the story makes him sound n-t-a, but I'm not sure it was a taking the gift away situation. Bit tacky of his niece to say sorry and then ask for the gift back too.", "NTA - What about the parent\u2019s of the \u2018happy couple\u2019? If a child of mine pulled this I\u2019d be livid and embarrassed and demanding they appear at the reception ASAP!", "NTA\n\nI got married at 22, mostly had friends in our wedding party, and took time for pictures between the ceremony and reception.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what cocktail hour is for. Not for running around town, getting trashed, and ditching all your guests with nothing to drink/do.\n\nThey are certainly young, but if they\u2019re \u201cjust kids\u201d then maybe they aren\u2019t mature enough to get married. And you didn\u2019t stop them from doing what they want, you just stopped waiting for them to grace you with their presence.", "NTA but y bother taking the gift back . Just move on.", "NTA. We own a venue and sometimes offer all-in packages wherein I arrange almost everything. One of the first things I tell the couple is that their guests should always have something to eat and drink while waiting for them. \n\nThese people have sacrificed time and money to be there on their special day, the least they could do is to keep them fed and to at least try to make it enjoyable for everyone involved.", "ESH. Obviously Bride and Groom suck. Your supposed to\nBe the mature 45 yr old adult. Leave the venue, express your opinion to your brother, but just leave the gift. What they did was definitely AHish but you made it so much worse by acting like a child here.", ">He tried to plead by saying \u201cthey\u2019re just kids let them have fun\u201d\n\nTell your brother kids shouldn't be getting married. It's for adults.\n\nNTA OP\n\nVery tacky and entitled of niece to ask for a gift after making all the guests wait for almost 2 hours. She should be embarrassed and apologize to everyone for such rude behaviour.\n\n Though I want to know OP were you and your wife the only ones who left the reception early ?", "NTA.  Niece only apologized because she wanted the gift. What a pair of brats. Don't worry.  This won't last a year. Neither is mature enough to be married. It would have been a waste of a gift.", "NAT that is ridiculous and I would\u2019ve done the same thing", "NTA only because the bride & groom didnt build in that getting trashed time. It\u2019s fine if you wanna bar hop or do shots, but then have the wedding at 2:30 instead. \n\nAlso what a stupid rule to not serve food or drinks while the guests are waiting. That\u2019s super shitty of the restaurant (and wasnt there a separate bar you could order from). This was definitely organized by a dumb 22 yr old. Tell her you\u2019ll give her her present at her next wedding. \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffe", "I\u2019m dying that she\u2019s asking for the gift. \nSave it for the second wedding.", "Nta\n\n\nI gotta love the excuse because they are kids.\n\n\nDude, they are literally old enough to marry. They are old enough to know you don't keep guests waiting an hour plus.\n\n\nIf you can't respect those closest to you, then you can freak off.\n\n\nWhat the couple did was flat out wrong. Because they wanted to get drunk. \n\nAlso, the gift wasn't in the couples' custody.  You can learn some manners before I spend a dime on you. The only reason the niece even apologized was because she wanted the gift.\n\nFinally, this couple will be divorced within 2 years. They sound immature.  Have no sense of responsibility or manners.", "Well they act like children. I'm surprised if not all guest walked out with their presents", "NTA! So you mean to tell me you and everyone else were expected to wait 90+ minutes with nothing to drink or eat, sitting there hoping they would show up eventually? Oh hell no! Did they actually show up in that next 20 minutes? And why would they want to get fall down drunk BEFORE the reception? I just don't understand their thinking at all. Good on you for not rewarding bad behavior!", "NTA\u2026\n\nClearly they have not been taught manners.\n\nThis makes me reflect on my 1st wedding where my MIL agreed to pay the bar tab. She could have paid extra per plate instead of per drink. I told her that was a really bad idea. She stopped paying 1/2 way through and I was so confused that my family started paying cash. \n\nI went up to bar for a glass of wine and I asked a friend why do you have cash out? They said it\u2019s a cash bar now. I was mortified! I asked friend for money cuz I wanted a glass of wine. The bartender laughed and said you are the bride. \n\nI was so embarrassed! It was a small wedding too. I still cringe thinking about it.", "Save the gift for her next wedding. NTA", "NTA. That was incredibly disrespectful.", "Enough AH to go around......The bride and groom most certainly are AH for doing what they did. Her family are AH for making excuses for bad behavior. You and your wife are AH for taking back tour gift.", "NTA for leaving. \n\nINFO: What was the gift/price range? I'm torn over whether taking the gift was petty.", "NTA. But keep the gift. You can give it to her at her next wedding. I give this two years, tops.", "Tough call. Leaving the reception was definitely warranted. In fact I'd have left well before you did. But taking the gift back? That's definitely a dick move. The question is, is it a proportionate dick move to what the wedding party did? Given how little tolerance I have for people who waste my time, I'd say it is. NTA.", "NTA. More than 100 people cleared their day to attend their wedding, and the couple left them hanging because they felt like it.\n\nAnd then asking the gift again.. damn", "The bride and groom sound immature.  Tell your niece you will give the gift at her next wedding.", "NTA\n\n2 hours is completely unacceptable even if food and drinks are being served. The bride showed her lack of maturity having the audacity to ask for the gift back.", "ok I could maaaaaybe say N A H BUT ONLY IF the food was served before they got there. I\u2019m pretty sure most couples take some time to themselves between the ceremony and reception whether it\u2019s for photos or just having a private moment. but yea NTA because if they knew the rules they should have been considerate and at least entered the premises so the food could start and then go have their fun. i would bet that it seems like they would have preferred a super small friends and immediate family only wedding and got roped into invite a load of people by their parents", "Ironic that she called you an a hole.", "NTA. As for the mixed replies re: the gift- I would probably have taken the gift back and replaced it with an envelope containing a $10 bill.", "NTA \n\nIf it was down to them miscalculating time for wedding photography or something then I might feel differently but they were pregaming in the limo and gave zero fucks about their guests. It was incredibly rude of them.", "NTA for leaving assuming you left without making a scene,  but I have my doubts about that.  If you made a scene you are TA for that as well. .  YTA for taking your gift back.\n\nYes your niece was young, stupid and thoughtless. So you had to wait 45 minutes for them to have a little private party with their friends.  You could have spent that time visiting with your family, but you decided it was all about you not being able to get a beer.  \n\n\nEdit:  Went back and read so I did not understand the timing the first time I read it, I thought he said he left at 5:45.  That being said, his sticking around later doesn't change my original thoughts.  NTA for leaving.  AH for taking the gift with him.  Also, if he made a big stink on leaving he is TA as well.", "NTA They played a stupid game and now they don't get any prizes.", "ESH\n\nIt's normal, at least where I am, for there to be a gap between the ceremony and the reception. This is usually filled by a cocktail hour. The niece sucks for not planning something to fill that time and instead just screwing off. She also sucks for asking for the gift again.\n\nThat said, storming off with the gift seems like a huge overreaction to poor planning.", "NTA. Guests come to weddings and bring gifts as a nice thing for the couple, attending a wedding is rarely a treat for anyone. It\u2019s special for the couple and mostly an obligation for the guests. You go because you love and support whoever it is and it\u2019s kind to help them celebrate their love, not because everyone is super into weddings. Drinks and dinner, and the reception, are the \u201cthank you\u201d for the guests for giving their time and money to take part in the couples celebration and giving them a gift for their new life together. If you\u2019re inconveniencing and mistreating them, you\u2019re doing it wrong. If it was 15 or 20 minutes I\u2019d say \u201clet it go, it\u2019s their day,\u201d but two hours was deliberately rude.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m surprised at the amount of people saying you shouldn\u2019t have taken back the gift. The bride didn\u2019t show up to accept it. It\u2019s still yours. I hope they do not convince you to give it to her now. \n\nSave it for her next wedding. There is no way people this immature and selfish can survive a marriage.", "NTA", "Anyone who makes guests wait at a venue for ninety minutes with no food or drinks is rude regardless of their age. NTA.", "NTA I'd be petty and tell your neice she can have the gift at her next wedding, but only if she can be bothered to actually show up for it.", "Well...  ESH.     I don't blame you for leaving, but taking back your gift was poor form.   \n\nYour niece should not have asked for the gift back or called you an asshole.  (and for that matter should not have made her guests waiting).", "NTA, but your niece is.", "Did nobody in the limo have a cell phone? They had to have gotten hammered with calls and texts, and they knew that all their guests were waiting with no food or drinks. NTA. I bet they're divorced within 2 years. Hope they don't have kids right away.", "I was with you until you took the gift back. Who do you think you are? ESH.", "Nta, actions have consequences. Can't leave a party waiting on you for an indefinite amount of time. Personally I would have read the room to see what others thought of the gift situation", "Info - was it at the direction of the couple or the planner or the venue that the bar remained closed during the actual reception?", "NTA. The family should be blowing up the father's phone, for raising such an irresponsible, unmannered child. Telling the limo driver to ride around on the freeway while they got drunk in the limo?! This ain't prom, lol. Never give them a wedding gift, OP, and don't accept any quid pro quo apologies. The audacity! Yikes.", "NTA and I cannot even imagine treating wedding guests this way. GUESTS WAITED AROUND FOR APPROX. 2 HOURS WITH NO FOOD OR DRINKS AFTER THE CEREMONY! This is Crazy!\n\nIt was also completely inappropriate and entitled for your niece to call and ask for your gift.", "NTA. Went to wedding 2 hours drive away. Open bar didn\u2019t start \u201cuntil after the ceremony\u201d on-site, per the bride\u2019s instructions. They started 2 hours late. So no drinks (non-alcoholic/ alcoholic), no food and it\u2019s 7pm. There was some tap water. Couldn\u2019t enjoy myself since I was so peeved. Left as soon as I could. You should have just left the gift tho.", "NTA. And don\u2019t listen to the comments saying you should have left the gift. If you do this to your guests who are wasting time and money to be there for your special day, they\u2019re more than within their right to decide you don\u2019t deserve something you spent money on. Anyone saying otherwise obviously shares the same maturity and self centered selfishness these two did.", "I\nBahaha... she asked for her gift back.  Tacky\n\n\"\"Maybe this was stupid on the venue people, but they wouldn\u2019t open the bar or bring around the appetizers until the bride and groom arrived.\"\"\n\nThis was the decision of bride and groom ..\nThey are paying the venue and caterer,  so they decide when or if serving appetizers  and peividing punch or wine before dinner\n\nNTA\n\nEDIT..  sometimes after wedding  photos  take an hour,  so guests are provided with appetizer and drinks before  wedding party returns  and dinner begins.", "NTA. Was taking the gift back petty? Probably. But the type of petty I can endorse. What's the old saying? Fuck around and find out.", "NTA.\n\nWhy did they need to get drunk on the way to a bar??", "ESH \u2014 if guests had been served at the reception venue, I wonder if OP still would have taken back the gift out of principle of the bride and groom not being there. A lot of pettiness on both sides.", "If they are \u201cjust kids\u201d then they should just throw a party on a Saturday night, not have a wedding. If you wanna do adult stuff then act like one. NTA", "I'm so confused, customs where you all are must be different than here.\n\nWhere I live, folks who have an hour and a half wait between the two don't go over to the reception right away and just - wait. Not unless an invitation specifically states there's food and drink while the wedding party does photos etc. We go and grab fast food or stop for a drink somewhere or even pop home and rest, then show up to the reception. And, when folks are late even after that,we wait, because it's something that happens once or maybe twice in a lifetime. We chat and socialise. We've taken care of ourselves for an hour and a half or more and can wait. If it's super off for some reason, often it means exhausted folks leave after dinner before the dance and drinks. But no one has a fit and takes back their gifts and leaves. \n\nSo to me and our norms here YTA, but I also get if it's not the norm for where you're from we wouldn't lean on my judgement \ud83e\udd37", "NTA", "Lol NTA. Pull that shit in my family they'd have walked into an empty venue with an empty gift table. How rude and self-absorbed. They should've at least let the venue take care of their guests while they had their little pregame limo party.", "NTA. Anyone that's planned a wedding (in NA at least) knows the appetizers are for the guests, not the party. My wife and I picked out great appetizers, we didn't get to eat any of them. They were there for our guests as we did pictures. If you have to leave your guests waiting at the reception for more than 30 minutes, give them food and drinks. Them fucking off to pregame their own wedding reception is fucking wild too. Like no one would be buying them drinks, or they don't have speeches and shit. I don't blame you at all dude.", "NTA for leaving, but YTA for taking back a gift.\n\nYour niece also sounds entitled since her apology was only about  receiving a present.", "NTA, but perhaps everyone (except the groom) will get another chance at a subsequent wedding because these two currently sound too immature for adulthood.", "NTA. Gifts are an entrenched custom but not absolutely mandatory. It\u2019s a faux pas to not bring one but keeping guests waiting for an hour plus without refreshments while a small group get schnonkered in the limousine is an epic level faux pas. There was a bar with beverages that were already paid for waiting for the wedding party to show up so it\u2019s not like they couldn\u2019t get their drink on. Asking about a gift is also pretty rude. Personally, I would have left the gift because it\u2019s not worth arguing about it but that just like my opinion, man. OTOH, if my blood sugar was low, I might not be so logical.", "NTA.  That was very rude and disrespectful, and tacky as fuck.", "NTA\n\nYou waited for a hot minute and they purposefully put a rule in place about food and drinks\n\n\nWhat if there was someone with an illness or a condition?\n\nNow, you COULD have left the gift, but the petty in me says you didn't have to.", "NTA- letting people stand around for 2 hours so you can get trashed? I would have taken the check back too and used the money to go have a nice dinner somewhere. They prioritized getting wasted over the comfort of their guests.", "NTA. That was very disrespectful to the guests and I would have left too. \n\nI am curious what the gift was. If it wasn't super extravagant I would have left it. But if we're talking serious $$$ I understand.", "NTA, I was barely 20 years old when I got married and I would NEVER have done that to my guests. If they wanted to goof off with their friends that's what bachelor/Bachelorette parties are for. The audacity of asking for the gift after the fact is beyond me. They're not \"kids\" and you don't owe them anything", "\u201cWe have 150 people we\u2019re supposed to love and care about, but let\u2019s leave them for an hour, thirsty and hungry, and go to the liquor store and get trashed like the trailer park trash we are.\u201d\n\nNTA. This type of juvenile behaviour should not be rewarded. I love how her tone went from apologetic to ape shit crazy in seconds. She\u2019s not sorry. She\u2019s only sorry about the loss of funds. I hope you were going to give her a great gift or a ton of cash.", "NTA -   If they wanted to do pix between wedding and reception (which is still somewhat rude) , they should have told everyone, reception at 6.  This is on the bride and groom, NOT the venue", "ESH based on this info, but the fact she wanted no family in the wedding party tells me there's more going on here than just this situation.", "NTA, It was reasonable for you to take your things and leave after that disaster. It was incredibly rude to make their guests wait an hour and a half for them. Your niece sounds like an obnoxious entitled teenager for throwing a tantrum about not getting a fucking gift. That's something I can see an 8 year old doing.", "NTA\n\nYour niece made it very clear that her wedding guests only mattered as props for her to be the center of attention and material or monetary value.", "NTA", "NTA that\u2019s crazy of the venue, wedding planner, parents of the disrespectful couple, wedding party and the horrible couple. I seriously doubt the couple paid for the venue and as a pissed off parent I\u2019d told them to start serving after all the guests arrived. Return the gift and get your money back.", "NTA we were late to our reception for similar reasons but we had an open bar and apps for the guests. They didn\u2019t care.", "If the bride and groom didn't realise the reception hadn't opened the bar or provided food, this is a little rude but I'll go NAH as it is their wedding day. It could be NTA if they did know and didn't care.", "NAH other than the venue. You probably should have left the gift but honestly let the couple enjoy their wedding day, it's stressful as fuck for them without extra pressure. The venue was asking for trouble and probably caused a huge rush to the bar when they eventually showed up.", "NTA  \nI'm surprised that half the guests hadn't left by then. To leave everyone standing around for an hour and a half is inexcusable.   \nDoes it get any more rude than calling and asking for a wedding gift??", "NTA - they were disrespectful to all their guests and don\u2019t blame you one bit for leaving with your gift.\n\nWonder how many of the guests left rather than waiting that long for the couple and party to arrive?\n\nDuring that time, they were the only ones to have access to the liquor as the venue wouldn\u2019t serve without the bride and groom.\n\nWhy do people make attending a wedding such a chore?", "NTA", "NTA. And good for you for taking the gift back!", "ESH\n\nGifts are for the couple and their future together, not for how well they throw a party.", "ESH - I don't understand the venue not starting service. When I got married we set up and paid for service to start at a set time and it would've started with it without us. Most weddings I've been to the cocktail reception starts pretty soon after the ceremony because the couple are off doing pictures. There has to have been some miscommunication there.\n\nWalking out and taking the gift...I mean sure, you're well within your rights to do so technically. And I get being tired of waiting, but this whole thing seems to have been a miscommunication and not the couple purposely screwing over their guests. Bride shouldn't have apologized to try to get the gift back then gotten mad when you said no.\n\nI do genuinely wonder if this was a venue screw up though.", "NTA", "YTA for thinking that 5 frat bros and 5 sorority sis's were going to do *anything* remotely classy.\n\nBut I would have done what you did, and hoped others followed", "ESH. \n\nYour niece and her husband for not arranging for refreshments while the guests waited for them and for being tacky enough to ask for the gift back. \n\nYou for taking the gift back in the first place and for the snark about \"no family in the wedding party.\" It's their wedding and they can have whoever they want standing up with them on their day.", "NTA, especially if the gift was money,  gift of money should cover the food and drinks you and your plus one consume, plus whatever amount you deem fit as a gift.  If you got no food and drinks, screw them.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm horrified by all the people suggesting that you did anything wrong by essentially not giving them a gift.\n\nMore specifically: while yes, you used the verbiage of \"taking your gift back\"; you didn't yank it out of their hands, you just didn't feel that someone who treated you like garbage warranted a wedding gift, so you didn't give it to them after all, you just took it home with you.  And if there were any doubt at all about it, the fact that your niece had the absolute unmitigated gall to *call you and ASK FOR A GIFT*, *knowing that the reason she hadn't gotten one was that she'd behaved so abominably towards her own guests*  and then swear at you when you understandably refused erased them completely. \n\nYou don't ask people for gifts. Not ever. Not under any circumstances. So, so tacky. And even tackier considering that the reason you left her wedding and didn't give her one was that she was out behaving like self-centred, drunken trash while you, her invited guest, sat around waiting for her at her own wedding reception that she didn't bother showing up to on time.\n\nNot only are you NTA, I'd venture to say that EVERY SINGLE GUEST should have followed your lead, picked up their gifts (to return to the store), and left before the hosts - who clearly didn't give a shit about anyone except themselves and their handful of childish besties - eventually came staggering through the door at the reception. When people make time and effort to show up to celebrate you and you treat them like shit, you don't get to ask or expect them to give you gifts and stick around to make much of you.", "She.... asked you for the gift?! Oh hell no. That apology was not sincere and she learned nothing.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - HOWEVER, depending on how extravagant the gift, return it, and send them a card with a few buck in it.  The gifts are meant more to support the new couple and not as a entry fee to the reception.  The wedding coordinator or the vendor are to blame for not planning for the appetizers or the bar.  Was the venue told not to open 'open bar', or not to serve at all?  Not to serve is a douchy move, but having a cash bar beforehand seems acceptable.", "NTA\nUrghs, that's why getting married is for grown ups.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I would have probably left the gift I don\u2019t blame you for taking it. What they did was incredibly selfish and disrespectful.\n\nI think the fact that she immediately took back her apology and cursed you out when you didn\u2019t give her the gift speaks volumes about her character. That wasn\u2019t an apology.\n\nI\u2019m assuming the gift was a check?", "NTA\n\nI absolutely would have left too, but I wouldn't have taken the gift back.", "NTA for leaving.  But the gift should gave been left.", "NTA. I would have left too. I probably wouldn\u2019t have told anyone and just left but I don\u2019t see anything you did as being wrong. If she\u2019s getting hung up on the gift like this I would probably be like \u2018ok, I\u2019ll bring your gift over\u2019 and show up with a 30 pack of natural light with some fireball shooters or something else appropriate for someone who wants to live in a frat house. If she didn\u2019t know what the gift was originally, there\u2019s room for some malicious compliance.", "NTA your niece was disrespectful to all of her guests and so you left. She wasn\u2019t there to actually be given the gift so since she never received it, it was still yours to do with what you wanted. I see no problem with you taking a gift you had brought back given the circumstances.", "ESH. The bride and groom were terribly rude oafs, and the parents of the bride should have ordered the venue to go ahead and serve refreshments. I've never heard of a venue that won't serve refreshments until the bride and groom arrive. You're not an AH for leaving. That's totally understandable. But YTA for taking your gift back. A wedding gift isn't a transactional exchange for being fed and entertained at a wedding.  It's a token of love and Good wishes for the couple. And this is your niece! Do you really not want her to have a wedding gift from you? Come on!", "NTA and she\u2019s very rude and entitled.", "Those people are jerks. Wedding gifts aren't guaranteed, and honestly I don't blame you. Who drives around drinking on their way TO a huge party?\n\nJust ludicrous red flag behavior. I mean, they are kids, but this is pretty egregious and crummy.", "NTA - if they wanted to fool around after the wedding that\u2019s their prerogative but withholding food and beverage service to make everyone wait on them like they\u2019re the kind and queen of England was ridiculous. I would have left, too.", "NTA.  I would have left around the 5:15 mark.", "NTA. When I got married we asked the driver to take a longer route to the reception so we wouldn\u2019t arrive before most of the guests. However, the bar was ready and there were snack type things available until dinner. Even with our longer route, we still were at the reception within a half hour of leaving the ceremony. What you described was absolutely unacceptable.", "ESH.

The family is blowing up with drama right now because of what I (and my wife) did. I must preface this by saying my family can be pushovers, they really all hate conflict and will definitely let themselves be run over by someone else in order to not cause a fight. I am not this way. \n\nThe wedding was on Saturday. Catholic ceremony in a church that was at 3:30 PM. The reception area was at a brewery about 15 minutes from the church. The reception was set to start at 5. Maybe this was stupid on the venue people, but they wouldn\u2019t open the bar or bring around the appetizers until the bride and groom arrived. \n\nService ended around 430 and everyone was told to go to the reception. The wedding party had a limo to take them and a separate limo took the parents, grandparents, siblings. The couple is young and decided against family in the wedding party lol. It was 4 sorority sisters and fraternity brothers on each side.  My wife and I drove. We got to the venue around 4:50 with the first family limo arriving around that time. By 5 I\u2019d say all 150 guests were there..but no bride and groom. The wedding coordinator was getting *pissed* as it\u2019s now 5:45 and no wedding party. We are all just standing around with no food or drinks. \n\nSomeone was able to get ahold of the MOH around this point and apparently the bride and groom told the limo driver to stop at a liquor store and then drive around on the highway for an hour so the wedding party could get trashed. At around 6 the MOH said they should be arriving in the next 20 minutes. \n\nMy wife and I looked at eachother and said we are out. We thought it was horribly disrespectful for them to do that to all their guests. I told my brother (FoB) that we were leaving and taking the gift with us. He tried to plead by saying \u201cthey\u2019re just kids let them have fun\u201d but I was having none of it. \n\nA few days after, I got an apology text from niece followed by an ask for the gift again. I said that I felt very disrespected and I didn\u2019t want to give a gift anymore. She snapped and called me an asshole.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We put a stop to that asap, but not before one relative had stormed out in disgust. And I do not blame him. As a young(ish) bride it did not occurr to me that I needed to tell the venue to charge us, not the guests - I assumed that was implicit with the money we had already given the hotel for that.", "NTA, but I wouldn't have mentioned taking back the gift...I would've just taken it back without saying anything.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nthe reception was at a brewery and they still needed to go get wasted beforehand?

They didn't even bother to come.", "Regardless of what they were told, the venue shouldn't have let 150 people who likely haven't eaten in hours to just sit around for an hour and a half with absolutely nothing. That's just poor service.", "The bride and groom may have told the venue to wait for them. It sounds like this little excursion of theirs was planned in advance but they told no guests.", "That's ridiculous, I would've left too.", "Was that because bride and groom said cocktail hour starts when they arrive??\n\nIf so, then venue is following the contract.", "That doesn\u2019t even make sense. The whole purpose of cocktail hour is to keep the guests busy while bridal party is doing photos and stuff.", "Generally weddings I have gone to, do cocktails and appetizers to keep the guests busy until the bride & groom arrive after pictures.", "OP just confirmed in the comment you replied to that it was a check.", "No pissing off 1 or 2 people makes them a bad host, pissing off everyone that was invited is what makes a shit person.", "They didn't fail to host properly, they successfully hosted in a way that was intentionally rude and disrespectful. They succeeded at what they attempted, but they did not attempt to be good hosts.", "That's ok, you'll learn.", "Regardless of what the gift is for, no one is entitled to it. It's a gift for a reason. You are the one giving it to them. You're not automatically expected to give someone a gift for anything, and it's under the buyer's discretion if they actually give it to them. I understand that it's for their wedding, but again they aren't actually entitled to the gift JUST BECAUSE it's their wedding.", "Do you give gifts to people who treat you poorly? This seems really strange.", "Yeah this seems like it's the venue's fault more than anything else. A cocktail hour before the bride and groom arrive is very common at weddings.", "I've heard of photos being taken before the ceremony  so there isn't a long wait before dinner. \n\nMy son and DIL  did this.  They also did a few photos  of them after the ceremony and then everyone went to the reception", ">Honestly at a wedding, especially a Catholic wedding it is absolutely not normal to wait for the bride and groom to arrive before serving any refreshments.\n\nIt might be cultural, I'm from Europe and where I live that's absolutely the norm. On one wedding it was really cold and I didn't really dress for the weather like a dumbass, a lot of people didn't have proper jackets or anything but we had to wait like an hour for the bride and groom to arrive since they were dealing with presents (culturally you give your wishes and presents after the ceremony by the church). They didn't allow anyone in.", "Which kinda makes it sound like it was on the orders of the bride/groom. Why else would the venue hold back especially that long? The newlyweds sound pretty full of themselves from OP's description. Maybe they specifically insisted to the planner that the party not start till they walk in the door.", "I wasn't sure if OP meant the wedding dinner appetizers  or just the snacks before actual dinner. \n\nMaybe since  reception was supposed to start at 5, there wasn't plans to provide  pre dinner appetizers. \n\nI'd  haveve taken much gift back too.  The marriage probably won't last long if they are that inconsiderate  to their guests", "Yep. I haven't been to a lot of weddings but the ones I have attended ALWAYS had at least cocktails going for the guests while the bride and groom were off doing photos.", "That makes things even worse.\n\n\nI can't believe how many people are saying you're wrong for taking the gift back. 2 hrs wtf.\n\n\nStay low contact with anyone harassing you and your wife.\n\n\nIf other people are ok with being mistreated, then that's on them and their self-esteem. \n\nI have learned that life is too short to be doormat.  People will walk all over you if you let them.", "Sure you going without a beer for a hour is totally worth ruining your relationship. She should have known that", "If the gift ended up on a gift table, then I still think it is rude to take it back.\n\nIf the gift never made it to the gift table, then the decision is up to the OP.", "They  probsbly have a contract with bride and groom.\nB&G decided when to open the bar", "Venues do what they are told to do.", " My understanding has always been that the cocktail hour at weddings was to ensure guests are fed and watered while wedding photos are taken. Shocking lack of hospitality on the part of the newlyweds and someone (parents of bride or groom or wedding planner) should have stepped in to avoid this. Or advised them beforehand that waiting for them to arrive to serve anything is rude (even without the super classy getting drunk on the side of the road diversion).\n\nNTA", "To be clear, I never thought of it that way because that way is dumb", "But what the venue did is probably on instructions from bride and groom. Cocktail hours are common but those would be in the contract with the venue.\n\nIf there was provision for food/drink at this time, someone like bride or grooms parents could have directed venue (given the ages I would think that the wedding is parent funded). Or parents could have coughed up more money to open the bar and end the problem.", "That\u2019s not the point. The point is it was supposed to start at 5 and they made no effort at all to get there on time. There were over 150 people there. They showed they only cared about their wedding party.", "It wasn\u2019t about a beer, 5pm is dinner time. They weren\u2019t given anything for 2 hours!!!! That\u2019s ridiculous and rude, they all just sat there all 150 people for 2 hours with no food or drinks..", "You're phrasing this wrong. It is the cousin that ruined that relationship, not OP.", "> Sure you going without a beer for a hour is totally worth ruining your relationship\n\nThis is what should be said to the bride and groom, not OP.", "I guess my position is that if you don't even show up to the event to know whether or not the gift had been left on the gift table, you don't really have any standing to criticize. The difference between OP not leaving the gift on the table and OP taking the gift back after leaving it on the table is trivial considering the bride and groom didn't even arrive by the time OP left.", "Eh, at my wedding I told then venue as soon as our ceremony was over (ceremony and reception at the same place) that I wanted them to serve food and drinks asap. My husband and I were eating upstairs before coming door for our first dance. My BIL came ask us if we wanted drinks or anything and said the venue was saying they couldn\u2019t eat until we came down. I then let the venue know I want them to start serving NOW. so they don\u2019t always listen.", "\ud83d\ude02", "That's very smart of you. I am so impressed.", "You genuinely can't wait 2 hours without food lmao", "Small issue, yes. But in my personal opinion, taking gifts back is wrong.\n\nI am sure we can agree to disagree.", "Lmso, what do you think 150 people should have done for 2 hours. Again it was the rudeness. You sound like one if this classless people who would do that type of thing . Sounds like their were elderly there. What if someone had a medical condition.  He even noted no one ate dinner till 9pm that\u2019s a long time with no food if the wedding was at 3 which means people headed to the event about 2 so yah that\u2019s a long fucking time with no food and drinks. I would have left pissed too", "> in my personal opinion, taking gifts back is wrong.\n\nYeah I guess the difference here is that in my opinion the gift was never given if the recipients were never even at the event to receive the gift. Doesn't even seem right to call someone a recipient, honestly.", "Sure. However, they never received a gift. They were never handed the gift nor opened it."]}
