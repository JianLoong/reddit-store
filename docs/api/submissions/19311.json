We have all lived together for around 3 years and generally speaking, it's actually not bad at all. My SIL is an overnight dispatcher and my husband works construction. I'm currently placed on early leave due to pregnancy complications (31 weeks) and my BIL has been out of work for months. Money has never been an issue. The home is owned outright and grandfathered in to a cheap land tax bracket so honestly, off one income alone, all bills are covered and then some. Just to paint the perspective of how money is currently not an issue and never has been. \n\nThe issue is that my BIL has started offering to watch our neices emotional support pet (not registered- just bought the vest online) while she is at school/work. The dog gets dropped off here at 5am and is picked up around 8pm. It's a small dog with severe separation anxiety and can be quite annoying. She whines if you walk out of her sight. Insists on being held the entire time she's here. She is hardly house broken. Insists on sticking her tongue down your throat or in your ears nonstop, as she never stops licking. And for the past week, my BIL has been bringing the dog in to whatever room I'm in and saying \"Who's that? Go get her.\" And then walking out of the room, leaving me with this dog that I never agreed to watch and quite frankly, I'm getting touched out by. I'm starting to become pissed even having the dog in the same room as me due to the behaviors and I've voiced several times I don't want the dog near me. The dog always ends up back with me and people here are starting to wonder why my attitude has spiraled to a point of me snapping at everyone.\n\nWell, we had a BBQ here yesterday and the whole family shows up. At some point our niece was talking to her dog saying \"Uncle David's treating you good, right? Does the baby get spoiled.\" And I piped up with \"Uncle David never has that dog. Uncle David pawns that dog off on me all day long while he sits in his bedroom playing video games.\" The whole family was standing right there when I said it and our nieces mother flipped out because apparently she's been paying David $40 a week to watch the dog for them. I'm being told I'm an AH and overreacting because \"you don't have the dog all the fucking time\" and made to feel guilty because the dog prefers me anyhow. But more importantly, I'm being shit on because I called David out in front of the family and now everyone is pissed and calling him a \"lazy weasel\".", "created_utc": 1686250297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144hkzc/aita_for_outing_my_bil_in_front_of_the_family/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What a cool thing for other people to have to deal with.\n\n>I've voiced several times I don't want the dog near me. The dog always ends up back with me... she's been paying David $40 a week to watch the dog for them... now everyone is pissed and calling him a \"lazy weasel\".\n\nThat's exactly what he is. What's his argument here? \"Quiet down so I can keep lying to my kid, making you miserable, and taking her money?\"", "NTA, he is a lazy weasel. There is nothing more to say on the subject, he is getting paid to do a job he does jot do.", "NTA but he definitely is, was getting paid and dumping the dog on you, it\u2019s not an emotional support dog sounds like a badly socialised and untrained nightmare.\n\nIf he tries again get the dog, put it in his room and say no firmly until he takes the hint, hopefully it never will.\n\nUncle Dave sounds like a leech, not like has to work so why bother\u2026\u2026\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d", "NTA good on you.

He continued. He's responsible for the dog, not you. What you did may not have been the most tactful, but he kind of reaped the consequences of his own actions.", "NTA. You\u2019ve expressed multiple times that you didn\u2019t want the dog near you yet he ignored your boundaries. He also pawned the dog off on you without your consent and was getting paid when he wasn\u2019t actually doing the job. He deserved to be called out for his bs.", "NTA\n\nWho knew that if you don\u2019t do the job you are paid to do the people paying you would be unhappy\u2026 imagine that!\n\nHe\u2019s a lazy weasel - he\u2019s pissed off that everyone found out and is now deflecting that onto you. Prick.", "NTA - you spoke the truth. If the truth is viewed as a negative THAT'S HIS PROBLEM. Them calling him lazy is pretty much spot-on with reality, so again, it's not your fault. It's his and he needs to fix it.", "NTA - Uncle Dave is in fact a lazy weasel.  I have a feeling things will change going forward.", "NTA\n\nDid it NEED to be in front of the whole family? No, but that doesn't make it less true. Your niece's mom 100% should be aware David isn't watching the dog, because if she's going to pay someone, it sounds like that should be you. \n\nSome people may say there's a time and place for this, and they might be right, but honestly there's no good way to out someone for being a slacker. David should think on that, especially living rent free. Money may not be an issue, but he's taking advantage of the situation, and especially you.", "NTA- and I'd tell him, if you don't like being called the lazy weasel, maybe don't be one.  You took money to dog-sit, made the dog my problem and now you're upset because I called you out on it?  Get over yourself. How did you think this was gonna go?", "He is a lazy weasel.\n\nNTA", "NTA! \"Uncle David\" was overdue to get called out on this. He gets the money, you do the work, he's happy. Great arrangement for him, sucks for you.

His family has it right, \"lazy weasel'!  Please, please create an invoice for every week he got paid.", "NTA\n\nHe was getting paid for work he wasn't doing, while already relegating that responsibility to you. It's completely understandable for you to be annoyed at him because not everyone wants to have a dog by their side.\n\nHowever, you should have communicated your issues calmly to both the dog's owner and your BIL before you got to a point where you took your frustration out on everyone.", "nta... truth is truth.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019ve been clear with your BIL that you don\u2019t want the dog in with you.

He fucked around & found out :) You have told him numerous times that you didn't want the dog near you. Yet he keeps dropping it in your lap like the lazy weasel that he is. He was even being Paid to watch the dog & couldn't manage, lol. He rightly deserves any critism that is coming his way. I'll venture to say that the only person whining is BIL ;) He needs to STFU.", "NTA", "NTA.  Annoying dog is annoying, makes you mad - rightfully so. You've voiced your opinion and don't want the dog near you. Assuming you've voiced your concerns / grievances to BIL directly as well as your husband, then I probably would have ended up doing the same thing you did.", "Well uncle david, if the boot fits \u2026!", "NTA", "NTA! It\u2019s crazy he was being paid and dumping that on you!", "I think you let it go too far and then you (not surprisingly) snapped.

David absolutely deserved to be called out publicly.", "NTA\n\nHe wouldn't stop being a lazy weasel, so you had to be a rat and expose him to the whole family.", "NTA\n\nIf your BIL was supposed to be watching the dog and getting paid for it then that's what he should have been doing.\n\nSide note: As an ESA that dog is failing, it seems to need more emotional support than your niece and needs someone to train it properly.  Considering that your BIL is getting paid to look after it, he may as well be the one training it.", "Nta. But someone please find that dog a good home.", "NTA, he is a lazy weasel.", "Info:  Just curious. Have you ever told him. \"Hey can you stop pawning the dog off on me?\"", "NTA.  But, you could/should have probably just said something to David before you burned him.  He really has no business pawning the dog off on you or anyone else when he is being paid to watch it.  In the moment it can be hard to bite your tongue, but it definitely solved your problem.", "YTA, not for having these very reasonable feelings about this situation, but for letting it go on for so long without attempting to remedy it before it going this far.  I know its not easy discussing issues with ppl you live with, but this may have been avoided if you voiced your opinion in a less extreme way.  That all being said, I dont think you are wrong in your assessment of the situation, jsut how you handled it", "ESH. Him for obvious reasons. You for letting it continue and then causing an issue at a family gathering about it. Take the dog back to BIL or tell niece that the dog isn\u2019t allowed back over until it\u2019s trained.", "Yeah YTA - This would be a good conversation to have with your BIL. But ya know... its not that bad. Calling him out at a family even is about the best place to do it. What? You get paid?
