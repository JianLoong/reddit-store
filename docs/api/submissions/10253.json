As far as food goes, don\u2019t buy anything to leave in the kitchen, and lock up whatever you can in your room. And ask to see her money before going out to eat with her, and YOU should \u201cforget\u201d your card and money this time. See how she likes it. Do not continue to let her take advantage of you, and do not continue to feed her. Your family having money does not mean you need to support her. NTA", "It\u2019s funny she blames her issues on being a Virgo. I just looked it up and she\u2019s anything but! Some of the descriptions include: industrious, pays attention to detail, finicky, and puts helping others over their own comfort.\n\nNTA. It isn\u2019t your job to take care of her. You\u2019ve got a LOT on your plate. She isn\u2019t one. As soon as you can find another place to live. Meanwhile, lock up your food, and learn to say no."]}
