My mom has four kids from her first marriage. Josh (28), Ella (26), Poppy (24) and Jax (20). All four of them have the same bio parents. From what I know their father is not a great guy and did some stuff to my mom but my mom and dad always kept me as far from him as possible so I don't know him really. But his kids with my mom continued to live with him half the time until they were each 18. They are still really close to him today as well.\n\nI (16f) have always been the outsider with them. Even with Jax who was closest in age to me and he doesn't remember a time before I was born, is closer to them than he is to me.\n\nI have learned to accept I am not their sister or their family and I am not their friend either. So when Josh got engaged I did not expected to be in his wedding. But my parents, especially my mom, did. So when they found out Josh's future wife's younger siblings (like much younger) were bridesmaids and groomsmen and I was the only sibling included, my mom went to speak to Josh, which in turn meant all four of her other kids told her I was not their sibling and even if she loved me, they did not, and I wasn't wanted anywhere near them. Neither was my dad. But he was invited to keep her happy. I would not be.\n\nMy parents have been oh so stuck on this and then a few days ago I was like, this was no surprise to me, and I'm shocked it is for you guys, none of the four of them talk to me and I have always been the outsider with them. My parents were so upset and told me I should expect it because I am just as much a sibling as they are. I told them my whole life I have known they did not love me. I also told them that at one time I would have cried so hard. But that I'm now at the point where that's just the fact of life. I told them I would have been speechless if I had been asked, so no, I wasn't surprised and they should let it go because I would not want to be in a wedding where nobody wants or even likes me.\n\nMy parents are so mad that I have this attitude about it. They want me to care more and said I was very flippant in saying I was not surprised.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687435458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g1p4c/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_im_not_surprised/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were all just kids. Unless y\u2019all were raised by bears it appears the adults dropped the ball a long time ago on this one.", "You are NTA.\n\nHowever I hate to break this to you but reading between the lines I wonder if part of the problem is that your mum has not been honest with you about the circumstances surrounding the breakdown of her previous marriage. This may have contributed toward your half siblings feelings toward you all your life.", "Your parents want you to \u201ccare more\u201d. WTF, so you can be disappointed and cry? \n\nYou have accepted that your step siblings DNGAF about you. The groom couldn\u2019t even be bothered to invite you to the wedding, much less have you in the wedding party. And your mama is just now noticing the distant relationship you all have? Oblivious much?\n\nGo do something really nice or fun for yourself on the day(s) of the wedding. NTA", "Nta but you parents really failed you here. They were so blind of the other kids treatment of you for your entire life that they are the only ones surprised. When you were younger this had to be so painful for you all the time, but they were so focused on pretending they never did anything to help the situation. Ultimately you cannot force feelings where there are none. \nWhat they need to do is make sure to actually see and celebrate you, and apologize big time. \nAnd make sure the older siblings never have any legal power over you in your parent\u2019s wills, and are never named as executors. You would be immediately screwed out of absolutely everything. Let their dad provide for them.", "NTA - I don\u2019t understand why your mom and dad are so mad on your behalf all of a sudden. Were they living under a rock all these years that your half-siblings disliked you and excluded you?", "NTA --- That you didn't expect to be in the bridal party ok but to not even get an invite is a really shitty thing to do.", "NTA, why would you care if they did or didn't ask you to be a part of the ceremony? Don't even waste your energy on them if that's the way they want to operate.\n\nI don't know what happened between your mom and her ex (their dad) but that's where the friction may be, IMO. They've heard a different side of the story than you did, which is my guess. The fact that they stayed with the Dad, rather than going with your Mom leaves me with so many questions as well.", "NTA\n\nIt's always hard to blend families together, especially whenever there are kids involved. Sometimes it works out amazing and sometimes it doesn't, this situation makes me wonder what happened between your mom and their dad though. Some people hold resentment towards their parents if one of them did something bad like cheating, and that resentment sometimes transfers to the child of their parent and their new partner. There's a chance that their father was feeding them lies about your mom and your dad, or they could know something about your mom and dad that you don't. \n\nIt's definitely not right to say they never loved you, sadly though that happens in blended families. My stepdads two daughters are horrible to me and my brother while our stepbrother is amazing. I'm sorry this happened to you, and they shouldn't be shocked that you said you weren't shocked. They should have seen their behavior towards you as you all grew up together, but it seems like they didn't.\n\nYou have clearly already processed that your step siblings don't like or care for you, your parents especially your mom don't seem to want to acknowledge the fact that this has been happening for years under her nose.", "NTA.  I think you may be more emotionally mature then your parents.  I have 1 bio, 1 half, and a step sibling.  I get it.  I'm not really close to the younger 2, because they really haven't wanted to.  Can't force them to want to be close to me.  I was pleased and surprised when I was invited to my youngest brother's wedding.  Wouldn't even think about being in it.", "NTA\n\nI am sorry you have this kind of relationship with your half siblings. It sounds awful. I have a half sister and I could never imagine my life without her in it.\n\nYou handled this very maturely. What did your parents what you to do? Throw a fit and cry about it? Scream at your sibling until they let you in out of guilt? How did they want you to handle this?\n\nAlso, it's Josh's wedding. He can do what he wants. Are you parents paying for it? If so that would be the only leg they have to stand on. Other than that, Josh can do what he wants for the wedding. \n\nDid your parents not know how your siblings felt about you? \n\nYou are the least problematic person in this story.", "NTA.  Your parents are more upset that your feelings aren\u2019t hurt?  They want you to feel hurt?  How loving of them!", "Your parents are oblivious and you\u2019re siblings are awful for making you pay for your moms mistakes all these years. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with all of these people. You\u2019re def not the asshole here. \n\nIt\u2019s also weird that you aren\u2019t invited but your dad is. I feel like their issue is really with your parents and whatever happened before you were born. But it\u2019s really weird to exclude you when you\u2019re literally just a kid", "NTA you are flippant because it's what you always known your whole life. It is concerning that it took 16 years for your parents to realize that you were excluded from your step-siblings", "NTA. Your parents seem rather oblivious.", "NTA -- your parents are awful.", "NTA.  Your parents want ALL of their children to love and care for one another and always look out for each other.  That has resulted in them not seeing things the same way you do.  Of course you are not the asshole for understanding your place in their lives.  This \"attitude\" you display is an emotional detachment that has taken a lifetime to build.  It isn't your fault.  Perhaps they could have done a better job of ensuring that you guys felt differently about each other and perhaps even a monumental effort would have resulted in the same outcome.  Try to make them understand that this attitude you have isn't something that is new.  It's what you have experienced all of your life and your only way to keep that from crushing you every time it becomes evident is to detach yourself.  This is a direct result of the life all of you were thrust into.  \n\nI'm you in my family.  My parents both had kids from previous marriages and had me and my sister together.  I have virtually no relationship with any of my siblings (the half-sibs) because they could not care less about me.  My sister passed when she was 41 about 15 years ago and NONE of them even came to her funeral.  It's not your fault.  You cannot force someone to have feelings.  Your parents could have fostered a household that encouraged those feelings and they would have them on their own.  It didn't happen, for whatever reason.  You should tell your parents that you are past the pain of not being accepted and they are just goin gto have to accept what relationship you all have.", "Nta. You can tell your parents they (your parents) are the ones hurting you by insisting on this. She can't fight emotions, even if it stems or leads to aweful behavior. She can tell them it's aweful behavior as long she doesn't involve you any more in it.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this.", "Another story of delusional parent(s) not seeing what is clear to everyone else. \n\nNTA", "NTA. For 16 years your parents have been pretty oblivious as to how your half siblings treated you and now they want you to care? The time to try and work on this was 15 years ago. I understand that sometimes children from first marriage see the new family as the reason why their parents are no longer together, but that would\u2019ve been your mothers responsibility to ensure that didn\u2019t happen. It would have been her responsibility to see that her children at least had a relationship where they would\u2019ve all been invited to each others wedding. Unless you truly want to make an effort to establish a relationship, then I would simply go about my life and be happy.", "You are entitled to your opinion, even if it distorts what your parents see as the truth. NTA.\n\nI believe your way if handling it is likely to avoid escalating a family feud too.", "NTA. And it\u2019s pretty awful that it took this for your mother to realize her other children weren\u2019t treating you nicely. Maybe she should take some responsibility for their behavior.", "NTA.\n\nThe situation with your half siblings should have been addressed by mom a LONG time ago, but that\u2019s now water under the bridge.", "What?!? They are mad at YOU?!? They need to be mad at the other kids and themselves for being so oblivious for 16 years!\n\nNTA. But your family is filled with AH. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that OP\u2019s parents have been married for 19 years but her mom has a 20yo son (Jax) with her first husband leads me to suspect that her parents were having an affair that lead to the destruction of that first family. That may also explain why OP\u2019s half-siblings dislike her and her father so much and don\u2019t want anything to do with them. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s no wonder OP hasn\u2019t been told the truth and only knows her parents skewed version of the story.", "They split time equally between mom and their dad.

He doesn't even speak to dad when he sees him. Same for me though.\n\nI'm less than and not important and they can make some (half assed) excuses as why I'm not invited but don't have a lot with dad.", "Those kids were kids. They didn\u2019t how how to manage the situation anymore than you did. Perhaps, they didn\u2019t want their parents to get divorced & start a new family. It appears there is some bitterness & resentment with all of Mom\u2019s kids. \n\nYour parents dropped the ball if they have been completely oblivious to what has been happening in their home. Just because kids are in the same space doesn\u2019t automatically mean they all like each other. That requires involvement & effort from parents.

For one, that is a huge age difference so between you and the next youngest so it would be surprising if you were close, and then compounded by the fact they lived with their father for half the time? \n\nI suspect their annoyance at you is because they had this image in their head of this perfect blended family and that illusion is now shattered. \n\nNTA.", "They never bothered to talk to any of you about how you felt?", "There\u2019s definitely more to this story than OP has been told... sigh... these poor kids. What a mess.", "OK, I see. I'm still wondering if the Dad is telling a different story so it's possible they may be harboring feelings. It could be long overdue, but a family meeting wouldn't be a bad idea. I have a half brother and a step brother, but we weren't even taught that terminology. They were just my *brothers*. My parents and the exs involved didn't want there to be a divide between us.", "I feel like it would make more sense to exclude your dad than you. But you seem like an innocent bystander in all of these. Even if people suspicions are true and your parents had an affair and that\u2019s why they hate your dad that\u2019s such a shot reason for them to treat you so poorly. They seem to be taking their anger out on you instead of just speaking to your mom and actually confronting whatever issue they have. I get that they were kids but not they\u2019re adults and taking it out on another kid", "NTA. Plus now everyone will see how this \u201ehappy happy fam\u2018ly\u201c really works, since the youngest kid is not even invited\u2026 of course they\u2019re upset.", "They would never go for a family meeting. We haven't all been in the same room together in years and I don't see that changing in the near future. I know their dad could have said stuff or maybe they just hated having divorced parents. I'm not sure. But I know I don't think anything will change with it.", "I can see why it would. But including me would mean I exist and because I only share a mom with them, they don't want me to. They wish I had never existed and hate that I do. That's something I have learned to live with and I don't know that anything would change that. Maybe even if things had gone down different with mom and their dad, I'm not sure they would have wanted me.", "I hate to hear that. Whatever happened between your Mom and their Dad has nothing to do with you and shouldn't even affect how they treat you or whether or not they consider you a sibling.\n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with it."]}
