So if she or you got a bail bondsman, it cost 10%. You would pay $100, the bondsman covers the other $900. Then you basically lose the 100 even if she shows up. However, if she doesn\u2019t, the bondsman goes after her, chases her down like an animal, and she gets in trouble with the court, but\u2026 the $100 is basically the fee they charge to provide this service. I have never known a single person who asked for the entire bond from a family member. Only enough to pay a bondsman. Sounds like this is BS. I don\u2019t know you or your cousin so not sure. However, one more thing to remember. Any time anyone has called me from jail, you need to set up a phone account for thier collect calls. You need to give a credit card number.

Bailing someone out also means if they show, you could in theory be responsible for the entire bail to the court.

You might tell yourself that you and your cousin are close, but the truth is she couldn't care less about you.  You're just another easy mark.

They'll find out the charges and cost for you (and then just don't show up to pay it). \n\nYou should be able to Google the phone number she called you on, and it should trace to either the local jail, or something like NCIC which is the inmate phone company where I am. \n\nAlso, you cannot send *her* money, generally speaking to bail someone out, you have to have someone on the outside (either a person or a bonding agency) go and post it.", "You need to stop that right now, do they pay you back, would they do the same for you?

I had a close friend that was always on the verge of having utilities turned off, being evicted, etc. The last time their kitten was ill and they couldn\u2019t afford the vet visit. I paid the vet myself and swore that would be the end of it. The next time they asked for money to pay bills I didn\u2019t respond\u2026 and was later \u201cdefriended\u201d on Facebook.\n\nBy the time everything was said and done they owed me $2,000 which they never paid back\u2026 this was 10 years ago.

And by quickly I mean tens of thousands in debt within a month. \n\nOnly this summer, a friends sister had tried to commit suicide. Turned out she had blown through all her money doing drugs, and couldn't pay the rent. Nobody even knew she was on drugs, she wasn't known as a drinker or as someone who goes out to party, but as a bookworm.", "oh boy!", "I've only seen 2 types of people getting in debt and needing money all the time fast. Business owners with failing businesses, and addicts who just got introduced to drugs, blow through all their savings into debt and ask people money all the time in an arrogant fashion like they are entitled to it.  \nAnd she doesn't sound like a business owner.\n\nI hate to be a snitch, but there are so many red flags here that I would consider talking to her parents, not mentioning drugs immediately, but start with asking if she has money problems."]}
