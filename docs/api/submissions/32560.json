I asked her recently for it and she came up with a excuse then I asked why she didn\u2019t ask her parents and she said it\u2019s easier to get out of me and I told her I\u2019d never give her money again and immediately hung up before I said anything I\u2019d regret. \n\nThat was the last time we spoke until my phone rang last night and i didn\u2019t recognize the number but it was from my city, I answered anyways and it was a jail phone or something and asked if I accept charges and I said yes and it was my cousin asking me to send her 1000$ to cover the bond. I wasn\u2019t sure if she was being serious because it didn\u2019t sound like a robot it sounded like a person asking if I accepted the charges so I thought my own cousin was trying to scam me. She wasn\u2019t crying and didn\u2019t say why she was in so I said \u201cI\u2019m not that easy to get money out of like you think call your rich parents scammer\u201d she called me a cunt and hung up the phone. I\u2019m really not sure if she was in jail and i hope she\u2019s okay but I can\u2019t spare the money or anything and she has already ripped me off multiple times and says I\u2019m easy so I figured I\u2019d stand my ground finally!!
