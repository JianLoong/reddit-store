We both love to cook, so have always had a well-stocked kitchen. \n\nMy partner\u2019s brother (M24) has a fairly severe peanut allergy (potentially fatal if he ingests one and it isn\u2019t treated shortly afterwards).\n\nWe\u2019ve always kept nut products in our kitchen, on the basis that BIL (I\u2019ll call him that for convenience) lives 3 hours away, and has visited our place 3 times in the 5 years that we\u2019ve lived together. We dine out on those occasions, and it\u2019s never been an issue. BIL is very laid back about his allergy, and manages it well. \n\nMy partner went on holiday with her family in December, and since coming back has asked that we make our kitchen nut free, on the basis that she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable if her brother ever came to visit. \n\nI asked if there was a near-miss/issue on holiday, but there wasn\u2019t. I asked if BIL was planning a visit, or to visit more frequently, but he isn\u2019t. I asked if BIL had requested this himself, but he hasn\u2019t. She also wants to get rid of all nuts, not just peanuts/related allergens (he\u2019s fine with tree nuts, for example). \n\nThis would mean disposing of a lot of nuts, oils, spreads, and various other staples at risk of cross contamination. We also cook/bake with these things a lot, so it would mean a big shift in how we prepare food and what recipes we can use. I suggested we could store nut products completely separately in airtight containers and that I would thoroughly deep clean the next time he visits, but that apparently wouldn\u2019t be enough for comfort. \n\nI\u2019m not insensitive to how difficult allergies can be to manage, but I\u2019m not comfortable wasting so much produce and changing cooking habits so much for a hypothetical scenario which may never happen (BIL visiting and eating our cross-contaminated cooking). His home kitchen (he lives with his parents) houses peanuts, but they\u2019re just kept separate and not used around him. \n\nI also pointed out that my best friend has a similarly-severe shellfish allergy, but we make that work without major accommodations, despite him visiting far more frequently. \n\nMy partner is calling me insensitive, and is barely open to discussing the matter. This is unlike us, as we\u2019ve always communicated well and compromised in the past. This is what\u2019s making me doubt myself; am I being too stubborn? It feels like the issue has come out of nowhere, but I want to be as accommodating as I can within reason - I just disagree on where the line is being drawn.", "created_utc": 1673607107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10arme3/aita_for_not_wanting_to_turn_our_kitchen_nut_free/", "score": 1180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your compromises seem very reasonable to me.
