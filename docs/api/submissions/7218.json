We both love to cook, so have always had a well-stocked kitchen. \n\nMy partner\u2019s brother (M24) has a fairly severe peanut allergy (potentially fatal if he ingests one and it isn\u2019t treated shortly afterwards).\n\nWe\u2019ve always kept nut products in our kitchen, on the basis that BIL (I\u2019ll call him that for convenience) lives 3 hours away, and has visited our place 3 times in the 5 years that we\u2019ve lived together. We dine out on those occasions, and it\u2019s never been an issue. BIL is very laid back about his allergy, and manages it well. \n\nMy partner went on holiday with her family in December, and since coming back has asked that we make our kitchen nut free, on the basis that she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable if her brother ever came to visit. \n\nI asked if there was a near-miss/issue on holiday, but there wasn\u2019t. I asked if BIL was planning a visit, or to visit more frequently, but he isn\u2019t. I asked if BIL had requested this himself, but he hasn\u2019t. She also wants to get rid of all nuts, not just peanuts/related allergens (he\u2019s fine with tree nuts, for example). \n\nThis would mean disposing of a lot of nuts, oils, spreads, and various other staples at risk of cross contamination. We also cook/bake with these things a lot, so it would mean a big shift in how we prepare food and what recipes we can use. I suggested we could store nut products completely separately in airtight containers and that I would thoroughly deep clean the next time he visits, but that apparently wouldn\u2019t be enough for comfort. \n\nI\u2019m not insensitive to how difficult allergies can be to manage, but I\u2019m not comfortable wasting so much produce and changing cooking habits so much for a hypothetical scenario which may never happen (BIL visiting and eating our cross-contaminated cooking). His home kitchen (he lives with his parents) houses peanuts, but they\u2019re just kept separate and not used around him. \n\nI also pointed out that my best friend has a similarly-severe shellfish allergy, but we make that work without major accommodations, despite him visiting far more frequently. \n\nMy partner is calling me insensitive, and is barely open to discussing the matter. This is unlike us, as we\u2019ve always communicated well and compromised in the past. This is what\u2019s making me doubt myself; am I being too stubborn?

I think you have bigger problems than a nut free kitchen.", "NTA\n\nSomething is going on that you need to talk to your partner about.

I have many food allergies and I have done accommodations at my home, but I can't ask people to completely change their lifestyle to accommodate my occasional visit.

I feel like someone said something that made her think that she would be a bad sibling if she didn't make this accommodation. However,  it's really on the brother to take precautions about his allergy. People who have severe nut allergies don't eat out of the kitchens of others without a  lot of caution, and expecting you to alter your lives entirely for an occasional visitor is silly.", "NTA, especially with the fact that you cook with a lot of those products.

Its okay to make a compromise but especially since they never come over you shouldn\u2019t have to change your whole living to accommodate.", "NTA. That's beyond crazy talk from your gf.  BIL is an adult and he manages his allergy well himself.", "NTA.

Well .... a seemingly global con is that all cooking oils, whether vegetable, rape seed or even olive oil are diluted with peanut oil. Obviously certain brands, etc don't. However, it's far more common than you realise.", "As always, show this thread to your wife. You're unanimously NTA", "Nah. Your wife is unreasenable. But she's scared he might die so i don't call her TA for that", "Maybe I\u2019ve been on this sub too long bc my first thought was that the wife is moving the BIL in, and hasn\u2019t told OP", "I think OP needs to read between the lines. Her brother might not be coming to visit soon. He might be moving in soon hence the new need for a nut free kitchen.", "Maybe she just misses her brother and thinks this is a way to have him visit more often.", "Peanuts aren't even nuts. They are legumes like beans and peas. \n\nThis is like creating a dairy free kitchen because your brother has a gluten allergy. It makes no sense.", "I mean, if I'm going full AITA conspiracy mode, then its because she's cheating on him and her new BF has a peanut and tree nut allergy, right?", "What happened when your partner were away on holiday?", "Maybe she\u2019s having an affair with someone with a nut allergy\u2026 legit the only reason I can think of", "Yet, BIL situation right now is:\n\n> His home kitchen (he lives with his parents) houses peanuts, but they\u2019re just kept separate and not used around him.", "My boyfriend is allergic to tree nuts, I fucking love pistachios, if I know we\u2019re gonna hang out a certain day I won\u2019t eat any tree nuts. So for BIL just deep clean the kitchen before his visits and not use peanut stuff for a few days before hand. Getting rid of all nuts is a touch much \n\nOPs wife might be anxious about something unrelated and trying to put something in control that she can. \nThe issue is deeper than the Iranian yogurt.", "Damn guess she has to go too.", "Funny, the partner is complaining about nut allergies and you called partner \"nuts\" hahaha", "Yeah, I don't see much else that makes any sense.", "Responses like this make no sense because .. if you read it to comprehend, you\u2019d know that OP hasn\u2019t been stonewalling the convo and hasn\u2019t called his parter irrational .\n\nI just honestly want to know your thought process because babe this reach must be hurtin\u2019", "Thanks for your reply. Would you be happy eating at a close relatives house, if you knew they took the allergy seriously, kept ingredients separate, and did a thorough deep clean before you arrived?\n\nI would never pressure anyone to eat my food, but also want to give my BIL/friends with allergies the option, and make them as comfortable as possible. \n\nI appreciate that you don\u2019t speak for all with allergies, but I\u2019m always interested in opinions on the matter.", "Both fair points which have crossed my mind too. \n\nOn pregnancy, suffice to say that this likely isn\u2019t an issue, and I\u2019m confident my partner would let me know if it was. \n\nOn BIL moving in, I can\u2019t rule out that it was discussed, but would be surprised. I can\u2019t think why my partner wouldn\u2019t discuss it with me, and as far as I know everyone is happy and comfortable as they are. BIL looked at an apartment for himself recently and MIL was upset that he was considering moving out.", "I feel like I'm getting \"can bro move in with us *juuuuuuust* until he gets a job\" vibes", "Yep despite the name, peanuts are actually [legume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume?wprov=sfti1), a family of plants that also includes beans, lentils & alfalfa. While it\u2019s common to see an associated tree nut (aka true nut) allergy, they\u2019re distinct proteins and can occur independently.", ">Is she pregnant and afraid the baby will inherit a nut allergy?\n\nAlternately, is she pregnant and doesn't know it yet?", "Ha this was my thought, but it was a fleeting one until you said it too.", "If I could trust that all precautions were taken then absolutely. My boyfriend's 12 yr old has had to learn how to completely separate his peanut butter from everything else and to be cautious and aware of it.... It's been a years long process cause he is a child but he does a good job of it. If you could assure that there was no possible cross contamination then I absolutely would feel comfortable. The real issue with these allergies is so many people throw \"I'm allergic\" around when they are not and just dislike something so it makes people not take real allergies seriously. \nHowever I do agree that this is not about a possible visit- something shady is going down and I feel like OP is about to be blindsided", "Oooh that could be it! MIL putting worms in her ear.  I hope you guys come to a reasonable resolution. \n\nIf it were my husband I would sit down with him when we are both in a \"chill\" frame of mind and ask what this is about and where they are coming from. She could be stressed about something entirely unrelated and using this as a way to feel some form of control when she doesn't have control somewhere else. \n\nBest of luck you are NTA.", "What happened when your partner were away on holiday? Did she run into her old HS boyfriend or someone else? It sounds like she\u2019s starting a drama, and that rarely happens without a reason. She\u2019s for one reason or another trying to make you the bad guy.", "I know right, it should be introduced early not late, I came from a country where we do not have many peanuts allergies and we have peanuts in food all the time even since little babies. I also read a study in a country, can\u2019t remember which, where baby snacks were made out of peanuts so it was introduced super early in their lives and almost no dr had a patient with peanut allergy. I was quite shocked when I came to study in the US how many ppl are allergic to peanuts.", "Nope because OP states:\n\n> His home kitchen (he lives with his parents) houses peanuts, but they\u2019re just kept separate and not used around him.", "My drs never told me that!!! That's so frustrating. I've been allergic to peanuts my whole life, did not eat nuts, now allergic to nuts too.", "Way more logical than \u201cshe\u2019s cheating on him with someone with a nut allergy\u201d which is where my overactive imagination went lol", "That's what I thought!", "That post was a wild ride. Thank you for sharing that.", "Oh no! That sucks!!!! My kid is allergic to peanuts, so we try to give all the other nuts somewhat regularly. It\u2019s hard though because there so many different nuts!! We are like drowning in nuts over here \ud83d\ude01.", "I thought this too, maybe he told her he\u2019s having money issues or trouble with work while they were on holiday.", "except OP said that the BIL has nuts in his own kitchen, so this is just completely weird...", "Good point.  I edited my comment."]}
