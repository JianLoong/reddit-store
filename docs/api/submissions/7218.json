We both love to cook, so have always had a well-stocked kitchen. \n\nMy partner\u2019s brother (M24) has a fairly severe peanut allergy (potentially fatal if he ingests one and it isn\u2019t treated shortly afterwards).\n\nWe\u2019ve always kept nut products in our kitchen, on the basis that BIL (I\u2019ll call him that for convenience) lives 3 hours away, and has visited our place 3 times in the 5 years that we\u2019ve lived together. We dine out on those occasions, and it\u2019s never been an issue. BIL is very laid back about his allergy, and manages it well. \n\nMy partner went on holiday with her family in December, and since coming back has asked that we make our kitchen nut free, on the basis that she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable if her brother ever came to visit. \n\nI asked if there was a near-miss/issue on holiday, but there wasn\u2019t. I asked if BIL was planning a visit, or to visit more frequently, but he isn\u2019t. I asked if BIL had requested this himself, but he hasn\u2019t. She also wants to get rid of all nuts, not just peanuts/related allergens (he\u2019s fine with tree nuts, for example). \n\nThis would mean disposing of a lot of nuts, oils, spreads, and various other staples at risk of cross contamination. We also cook/bake with these things a lot, so it would mean a big shift in how we prepare food and what recipes we can use. I suggested we could store nut products completely separately in airtight containers and that I would thoroughly deep clean the next time he visits, but that apparently wouldn\u2019t be enough for comfort. \n\nI\u2019m not insensitive to how difficult allergies can be to manage, but I\u2019m not comfortable wasting so much produce and changing cooking habits so much for a hypothetical scenario which may never happen (BIL visiting and eating our cross-contaminated cooking). His home kitchen (he lives with his parents) houses peanuts, but they\u2019re just kept separate and not used around him. \n\nI also pointed out that my best friend has a similarly-severe shellfish allergy, but we make that work without major accommodations, despite him visiting far more frequently. \n\nMy partner is calling me insensitive, and is barely open to discussing the matter. This is unlike us, as we\u2019ve always communicated well and compromised in the past. This is what\u2019s making me doubt myself; am I being too stubborn? It feels like the issue has come out of nowhere, but I want to be as accommodating as I can within reason - I just disagree on where the line is being drawn.", "created_utc": 1673607107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10arme3/aita_for_not_wanting_to_turn_our_kitchen_nut_free/", "score": 246, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It wouldn't be unreasonable to get rid of the nut products and deep clean the kitchen if he was coming to visit. You could even reach out and say \"we'd love to have you visit. Let us know when you'd like to come so we can have the kitchen properly sanitised\". You suggested this, she shot it down.\n\nWhat *is* unreasonable is to force a household to be entirely nut free on the off chance that your BIL *might* visit once a year.\n\nIf this didn't originate with your BIL I'm wondering if another family member has gotten into your wife's ear. Maybe a \"brother would visit more often if you didn't make him allergic to your house\" type comment? Otherwise this is possibly paranoia, and could be a symptom of a bigger issue. I think you have bigger problems than a nut free kitchen.", "NTA\n\nSomething is going on that you need to talk to your partner about.  Something has changed?\n\nYour BIL barely visits and isn't concerned at all.  He sees his parents more and they still have peanuts in the house.  Your BIL isn't the issue but something has changed for your partner - does she have anxiety and it's suddenly worse and this is what she is focussing on?", "NTA, your partner is nuts. I have many food allergies and I have done accommodations at my home, but I can't ask people to completely change their lifestyle to accommodate my occasional visit. Yes when we are going to eat at some friends house I tell beforehand about my worst allergies and ask if it is possible not to serve dishes with those things. But if woud be unreasonable for them to throw out all of their nuts because I'm visiting twice a year.", "nta\n\nyour wife is being unreasonable. unless your bil is around more, there is no reason to remove all the nuts. there has to be a compromise.\n\nbut honestly, her strange behavior makes me wonder if something happened that made her think that way. maybe you should talk to her about that instead. why is she this worried all of a sudden?", "NTA he's not living there so there's no point in having a nut free kitchen", "NTA\n\nThis is unreasonable, and you need to figure out why this is her new perspective. I feel like someone said something that made her think that she would be a bad sibling if she didn't make this accommodation. However,  it's really on the brother to take precautions about his allergy. People who have severe nut allergies don't eat out of the kitchens of others without a  lot of caution, and expecting you to alter your lives entirely for an occasional visitor is silly.", "NTA, especially with the fact that you cook with a lot of those products. I\u2019m a baker myself and I\u2019d hate for someone to just force me to throw away my most important ingredients, just cuz someone who doesn\u2019t even live in our house has an allergy.", "NTA. This is an extreme and unreasonable position that she has taken", "NTA - You\u2019re all grown adults who are very aware of the allergy. I can\u2019t imagine you or your partner suddenly forgetting and serving him anything he\u2019s allergic to with how aware everyone is of it. Then there\u2019s the part where he\u2019s never eaten at your house in 5 years too. What\u2019s her reason for this change after 5 years??", "NTA. I think there is more going on here than this hypothetical BIL nut situation.", "NTA. I'd ask for a chance to think and revisit it in a few weeks. Then, talk to her about why her feelings have changed because this just seems odd.", "NTA. You have provided several work arounds, and it appears that she has decided that this is a hill to die on. Please be aware that you could be right but still destroy your relationship.", "NTA I actually like the idea of air tight sealed containers and heavy cleaning prior. Its okay to make a compromise but especially since they never come over you shouldn\u2019t have to change your whole living to accommodate.", "NTA. That's beyond crazy talk from your gf.  BIL is an adult and he manages his allergy well himself.", "NTA. This is an unreasonable and illogical request", "NTA - Clear the kitchen for someone who might or might not show up once a year max?\n\nHas something happened to make your partner Uber paranoid?", "NTA especially since he rarely visits anyway.", "NTA, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation, I am inclined to think she's testing how far she can force your hand on a relatively non-controversial topic. Do not waver.", "NTA and it's very strange this is coming out of no where. It's not a new allergy for her brother and she's known him forever. \n\nSomething is going on.\n\nI think your suggestion about separate air tight containers was very fair. You could even move them to the basement if he were to visit.", "NTA.\nThat's an outrageous \"precaution\" for someone who isn't even there regularly. Not to mention that peanut allergies are more closely related to legumes (like beans) than tree nuts (like walnuts).", "NTA, He lives 3 hours away, and if he wants to visit, he can just stay out of the kitchen and you all can go eat out. Completely throwing away food and other things for a potential visit is ridiculous.", "NAH\n\nShe seems worried over something, and you haven't been able to get her to say what she is worried about. Stop stonewalling the discussion by claiming that her argument is irrational and ask her why she wants this. Be open to the option of removing the nuts from the kitchen, but take her through what that would mean. Give her the space to make an argument why that effort would be warranted, go through some alternative solutions, and then come to a conclusion together. \n\nIf you are a couple that communicates well, you should be able to figure this out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s allergic to peanuts, which despite the misleading name, aren\u2019t classified as nuts.", "It would be different if it was a request to just remove peanuts, but requesting that you remove *all* nuts is odd. And it does sound like there's something else at play. Is she pregnant and afraid the baby will inherit a nut allergy?", "To me it's simple. If the brother-in-law is able to eat out at restaurants which will never be nut free then he's obviously comfortable with the minor risk that comes with it. If the house the brother-in-law lives in isn't nut free then he's obviously comfortable with the minor risk that comes with that.\n\nThis most definitely didn't originate with the brother-in-law and is some bizarre either power play or attempt to show her progressiveness/consideration when it's not warranted.

This also should be your hill to die on, because it's either controlling behaviour for \"no reason\" which is a giant red flag or (more likely) again, something happened and yes, if it's effecting you and how you should live your life you have a right to know", "Shot in the dark, but aren't a solid set of allergies genetic?

(Despite the name, peanuts aren\u2019t nuts.)", "The only thing that comes to mind is that her mother is very\u2026concerned about the allergy, and is often overly-protective (sometimes irrationally - they keep nuts in the kitchen, but justify it because it\u2019s a big house). \n\nThat said, I\u2019ve asked those questions and we\u2019ve never shied away from discussing her parent\u2019s behaviour.

I obviously asked, but was just told that she was never really happy with having nuts around, but dealt with it for convenience.

More discussion is definitely needed.", "NTA. I have a peanut allergy of the same severity and would never expect someone to do this for me. When I lived with my parents they always had peanut butter in but made sure it was stored away from anything I would need access to, made sure any utensils it was used with and surfaces it was used on were immediately thoroughly cleaned, and let me know not to use the kitchen until these things had happened. The only reactions I've ever had were when eating out. \n\nYour partner's anxiety must be coming from somewhere, maybe talking to her with your BIL present too would be helpful for getting to the source of it, his perspective might help her feel more comfortable with a less nuclear approach. Your compromises seem very reasonable to me. One note though, even if he doesn't have a tree nut allergy, he probably will not be able to eat other nuts either - they tend to process them on the same lines as peanuts so if you have an anaphylactic allergy they're still not suitable.", "NTA", "NTA.
