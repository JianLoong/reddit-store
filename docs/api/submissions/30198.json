They only have one full bathroom in the house since its an older house. My parents asked my if they can shower at my place. I said sure but only when I am there which is quite often except Monday and Wednesdays because I work but I am there on the evenings. I don't trust my family especially my mother to not go through my things or to \"just take a shower and leave\". She called me asking for a key and I said no but said she can come the night before and shower. She became upset and now I feel like an asshole. So am I?\n \nI wanted to add some more information... \nWhen I used to live with my parents, my mother would come to my bedroom and touch my stuff and go through my stuff but not like she was searching for something. My sister would also do the same and I was only allowed to tell my sister to get out only for my mother to say be \"nice to her\" and \"your over reacting\". I currently do not have a good relationship with my mom and sister. I don't trust them for many other issues in the past. I have also never been allowed to set healthy boundaries with my mom from what my therapist has told me.
