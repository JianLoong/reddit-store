I always try to be a good listener and be supportive to her, althouth often I disagree with her too.\n\nShe keeps having these conversations with me sometimes, where she tries to taunt me for not having a girlfriend and having a difficulty in talking to women usually. But a couple of days ago, I felt she said too much. What happened was, that she was consistently asking the same question, \" When are you gonna have a girlfriend, dude?\" And I was consistently telling her I am not in a rush, so she would say, \" You won't be able to dude! Look at how you become so shy around girls\". \n\nAnd while I was already feeling that she is being a bit rude/inconsiderate while speaking like this to me, the next thing she said was, \" Just look at your face already. You look overly cute so none of the girls out there would wanna date you\". \n\nThis kinda hurt me a lot, and I felt so upset, yet the only thing I said was, \" You're so weird, dude!!\". She laughed it off as if she is trying to say, \" It''s just fun games nothing serious lol!\" \n\nI felt pretty upset and felt that she doesnt sound like a friend, and didn't talk to her after that. Today, she texted me telling how she was mad at her ex for not talking to her after they broke up, and how she consistently keeps texting him and he doesn't reply much. \n\nTo this, an already upset me became a bit blunt, and told her, \" Why in the world would he? You both broke up just a week ago, and that too in a bitter way. He might be hurt and trying to move on, and you are not letting him do so, neither trying to move on yourself. Making it impossible for both of you!\" To this, she said that she feels bad that I am mad at her, and that she was already upset but my bluntness made her doubly upset etc etc. I told her that she should try to move on, try to reach out to sources that help her move on in life. I didn't respond to her anymore.\n\nAITA for being blunt to her because I was upset with her remarks on my looks?", "created_utc": 1673527531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109ysxw/aita_for_being_blunt_to_this_this_girl_after_she/", "score": 234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were honest, constructive and actually pretty restrained. She didn\u2019t like it but I don\u2019t think you said anything out of line, and I think it was the right move to stop engaging with her.

I thought good looks are a positive thing when it comes to dating no?", "NTA. Never TA when someone is negging you, which she was. She sounds like she\u2019s looking for attention from you while fixating over her ex.", "NTA sounds like she is taking advantage of you for emotional stimulus and i dont beleive what you said was that bad regardless of the looks comment. Part of me wonders if she wanted you to ask her out but regardless i doubt it would be a good relationship.", "NTA\n\nYou actually said what i would tell a close friend that broke up with his ex, you just move on no point wasting time on something that will probably fall apart again if it works in the first place.", "NTA but she is not and has never been your friend. She is a rando on a forum looking for attention. What you said to her was not too blunt or mean, it was actually really sound advice. What she said to you confirms she's an immature user with a mean streak. Ghost away!", "NTA at all.  What does \"overly cute\" mean??? If I were you, I'd cut ties with this girl ASAP.  It doesn't sound like this \"friendship\" is benefiting you at all", "NTA, sounds like it was pretty much a one sided friendship from the get go. Move on your morals are in the right place. You maybe could have been slightly less blunt about it but you said the right thing even if slightly aggressively. Brush it off and move on.", "NTA. She's passive-aggressive as hell. Stop trying to save her and move on. Why do you want someone like that in your life?", "NTA  \n\nBut why do you stay friends with this person.  It sounds very much like a one-sided \"friendship\".", "NTA. Sounds very much like this person was seeking attention, possibly even trying (in a very backwards way) to indicate she was interested in you.\n\nI think you were completely in the right to attempt to give her a reality check", "NTA\n\nYou gave her what she deserved.  But the stuff about your face being \"too cute\" sounds like she's into you.  If you did date her I imagine it would be pretty stressful for you as she will say provocative things and stir the pot whenever possible, but you might consider it anyway for the experience.  And when you have had enough, it'll be easy to dump her with it not being your fault so you won't have to feel guilty.  Just a thought.", "INFO I'm very strongly under the impression that she is a bit immature, but that she has feelings for you. Maybe temporary feelings because of emotional turbulence from her breakup, but I detected way more \"tsundere\" energy from her comments than malice or passive-aggression. At least the way you presented it, such as continuing to bring up the subject of your love life, implying that *other* girls might not be as into your cute face, etc.\n\nNothing unforgivably horrible was said between you, is it possible that this whole thing is a bad miscommunication of intention between casual friends (possibly involving underdeveloped social skills)?", "NTA. She insults you then gets mad at you when you give her normal advice that most people would have told their friends first day of the breakup?", "NTA\n\nYou don't need that toxic person in your life. Let someone else deal with her bs.", ">consistently asking the same question, \" When are you gonna have a girlfriend, dude?\"\n\nI want you to be available to be my boyfriend, are you available? \n\n>\" You won't be able to dude!

You look overly cute so none of the girls out there would wanna date you\". \n\nYou're gorgeous and out of my league, but I still want to date you, no one else will dare to because you're just so damn handsome. \n\n\n>Today, she texted me telling how she was mad at her ex for not talking to her after they broke up, and how she consistently keeps texting him and he doesn't reply much. \n\nBe jealous, be my white knight, tell me you'd date me so I can leave this chump alone and be with you. \n\nShe likes you my guy..

Don't feel too bad for her, she will be fine eventually.\n\nI am also getting the massive vibe that she broke up and is now hoping to get romantical attention from you, either as a rebound or she was crushing on you in the first place. Making an off-handed insult that lowers someone's esteem is not the way to go about it though.\n\nAlso people that dish out insults under the pretense of teasing but can't take a genuine observation are well, personally not the type of people I have the patience for haha. Though I would still be gentle in letting them know that I am taking some distance and not pursuing future continuation of the friendship.", "NTA imo she is hurting but that isn't an excuse to say things about you. What you said was true but probably came across too mean. She said a mean thing that could sound nice and I'm not even sure why she needed to. \n\nI suggest if you still want to talk to her, apologise for how you made her feel but tell her you meant it but should have been nicer about it. Then talk about how she is making you feel. Make it clear you won't want to be friends with someone who keeps doing the same thing.", "NTA. This girl is way self absorbed. You have to be blunt for many ppl to understand.", "NTA. \n\nShe was both self-centered and constantly putting you down.

Stop talking to her,she isn't worth your time.", "NTA. Even if she hadn't ridiculed your looks first, it is good advice to tell her to let him move on and to move on herself.
