John is a bully, not a jokester. A joke is when everyone laughs. Bullying is when everyone ELSE laughs. Did you go a little overboard? Maybe, but it was a move born out of frustration and regular abusive language, not something that you regularly do. Maybe practice a \"nicer\" response for the future because it's not likely John is going to stop until he starts getting called out repeatedly. In my head, it's something like this:\n\n*\"That's not funny John. That's rude and bullying and I don't appreciate it.\"*\n\nSay that when he tells his joke and repeat it after every excuse he comes up with. Whatever response you come up with, also take the time to practice in front of a mirror a few times so that it's easier to say when it's needed.

Good job OP. Brutal but deserved.", "Sometimes, you just have to be an asshole. This is one of those times. If you hurt his feelings, maybe he will reflect on all the crap he has said to you.
