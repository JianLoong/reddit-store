We are not intending on getting married anytime soon if ever. We met with some friends recently near our former workplace and bumped into a friend of mine that I used to work with at the pub. Let\u2019s call him John. \nFor context, John can be a lovely guy if he wants to but most of the time he is just making rude \u201cjokes\u201d. He would say to me I am fat and that I should get pregnant so\nI have an excuse, that I am a slut for flirting(when I was single), to shut up, no one cares while I\u2019m saying something and most of the time he says those things in front of many many people. I know even if he said it in private it\u2019s not nice but in public it\u2019s even worse. \nSo the other day when we bumped into him, he made a joke in front of everyone that my partner got me pregnant but won\u2019t even marry me, should have used protection and other things. I lost it. He recently got divorced due to his drinking problem and basically never being home. I replied to him by saying \u201cyou are gonna judge me? Where is your wife? Oh that\u2019s right, she divorced you!\u201d. He looked down and said nothing while the rest of his group kinda looked shocked. My partner said he has been asking for it for a while but I shouldn\u2019t have brought up the divorce. Am\nI the asshole?\n\nEdit: I just want to answer some questions\n1. At a time where I would end up homeless John didn\u2019t even think twice, he just said how much and helped me pay for a place. Sadly most of the time he is a d*ck and I am totally aware I should have spoken up sooner. \n2. The reason above is why I still considered him a friend. Since he brought my kid and partner in the conversation I\u2019m done with him. \n3. We haven\u2019t spoken in a long time and we weren\u2019t hanging out, he just happened to be at the same pub as we were near our old workplace so we said hello.\n4. I have told him before that this behaviour upsets me and that he is an asshole and he just kept doing the same thing!", "created_utc": 1692887128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1603fk7/aita_for_using_my_friends_divorce_against_him/", "score": 405, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

John is a bully, not a jokester. A joke is when everyone laughs. Bullying is when everyone ELSE laughs. Did you go a little overboard? Maybe, but it was a move born out of frustration and regular abusive language, not something that you regularly do. Maybe practice a \"nicer\" response for the future because it's not likely John is going to stop until he starts getting called out repeatedly. In my head, it's something like this:\n\n*\"That's not funny John. That's rude and bullying and I don't appreciate it.\"*\n\nSay that when he tells his joke and repeat it after every excuse he comes up with. Whatever response you come up with, also take the time to practice in front of a mirror a few times so that it's easier to say when it's needed. Otherwise, if human habits are any indication, you could freeze up and not say anything at all.", "NTA and he is not your friend", "The question is why do you want to call  a guy like him a friend?

Another line for you to use next time: \"Honestly, John, I don't know your wife puts up with you talking like tha- Oh, wait, nevermind.\"", "NTA \n\nI had a friend like this. Had. He doesn't have many friends anymore and can't figure out why. He's not a lovely person if he chooses to be an asshole", "NTA-You were way nicer to him then he deserved and hopefully he stops being an AH to you because it's nothing more than bullying.", "NTA. Sounds like he fucked around and found out. Stop hanging around this guy!", "NTA. You see a lot of \u201cthey\u2019re a nice person BUT\u201d - nope, they\u2019re an AH.", "NTA", "NTA.  He is not a friend, and your pointed remark was not wrong.", "NTA at all OP. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Man needs to learn to keep his mouth shut if he can't take what he dishes out. Good job OP. Brutal but deserved.", "Sometimes, you just have to be an asshole. This is one of those times. If you hurt his feelings, maybe he will reflect on all the crap he has said to you. Next time you see him just hold your head high and give the look of\u201dgot any shit to say today?\u201d Probably should have confronted him sooner.", "NTA and good for you. I probably would have said worse", "If you can't handle the heat, stay out of glass houses.", "If the shoe fits, won't be nothing.", "Don't dish it out if you can't take it. That's a motto I've taught my own kids. If you're prepared to talk shit, make bad jokes or input your opinion onto others lives be prepared for someone doing the same thing right back to you.

He got what was coming to him.", "No. John deserved to be put in his place. NTA.", "NTA. FAFO.", "John isn't your friend and seriously doubt he can be lovely.", "John is seriously an asshole.  You, not so much.  He pushed you too far, and you finally reacted.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He started it, you finished it. He got a taste of what he's been giving people and everyone has a limit.", "NTA but why are you friends with this jerk?", "So he can bring up the topic of your boyfriend and you having a child but him not wanting to marry you. Thats not offensive but telling him that his wife left is somehow offensive?\n\nDid your boyfriend tell your friend that he shouldn't bring it up when he made a joke about you? \n\nNTA", "Lovely guy??? NTA", "NTA.  You told him in the past that you didn't like his comments and he took it up a notch by bringing up your boyfriend and the fact that you had gotten pregnant.  \n\nDon't start none, don't get none.", "NTA - He made a rude comment that he knew was rude and got called on it.", "NTA\n\nJohn has that \"Asshole with a heart of gold\" but that doesn't take away he is an asshole. He needed to be given a dose of his own medicine. If anything you now have an opening to mend fences. Tell him you treated him like he treats others. And while he has redeeming qualities, (he helped you in your time of need, that is commendable) he has to be made aware his comments are bad and if he didn't like it, how do others feel.", " NTA - everyone was shocked because they expect that behavior from him and don\u2019t expect it from you. I\u2019m sure some of them were shocked and a little bit satisfied that someone finally BBC allied him out with a taste of his own medicine.\n\nIn the long run, it was probably good for him. He needs to know how it feels.", "NTA. People like him love cruel \"jokes\" as long as they aren't on the receiving end of them. I've known many of these people over the years. They never stop until they're knocked down a time or two. Sometimes figuratively, and sometimes literally. They need a dose of their own medicine.", "NTA\n\nJohn is still hurting from his divorce hence his behaviour. The fact he still hasn't got to grips with his drinking issues makes it worse. What he says to you is drink influenced.\n\nHis life probably is in the pub and hasn't much else of a life. I've seen that a few times. It is really sad.", "So, \\*mostly\\* NTA. The generally advisable course of action is to give warning shots and escalate slowly. No one could argue that what you said wasn't a proportionate response to the aggregate aggravation he's given you. You swung back in a way fitting everything he's done up to this point. But usually, a shot across the bow is considered sporting. That said, you didn't start this. You just finished it. NTA.", "Nta and those aren\u2019t jokes he\u2019s bullying you and is not a friend. Seriously, do your self a favour and drop him from your life already.", "NTA.  It may not have been the most classy move, but it was not undeserved.", "John can't be redeemed because he has great hospitality. He's an absolute asshole, I cannot even fathom speaking to a friend this way. \n\nI believe he's projecting his shitty circumstances and wants you to join in on his misery. Good on you for speaking out, hopefully he can sober up a bit and reflect.", "I will stay out of glass", "NTA he shouldn\u2019t dish it out if he can\u2019t take it, if your relationship is fair game then so is his.
