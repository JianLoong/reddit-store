Thank you for your concern though!' \n\nOr\n\n'Oft! Its mind boggling how they figure this stuff out.

On the one side she does not help enough, on the other, she is too overbearing? I think you have to figure out what you want from A MIL and what you want from YOUR MIL? \n\nAlso, do you know why she is asking? It sounds like you were in financial trouble in the past, maybe she is concerned? Maybe this is more the field where she can and wants to be present? And if that is the case, what do you want from her?", "NTA\n\nIt's not jealousy though. She wants to brag. I guarantee if you were to talk to some of her friends and associates, they would tell you that she brags about how much money her son is making.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like she wants to know if she can ask you for money in the future.\n\nIt's time your husband have serious talk with his mom about boundaries.", "I\u2019m not searching for conflict I\u2019m asking why should I explain myself to someone who offers no help or support to our lives, especially while we\u2019ve had to struggle!\n\nThe conflict is she continues to pester about my income SINCE we\u2019ve been doing better financially. When we struggled she had no interest or care.", "I\u2019d have liked my children to have a relationship with their grandmother but they don\u2019t. She sees them very randomly and a handful of times through the year. She lives less than 5 minutes drive away from us.\n\nSo her relationship with me personally, a catch up on life. But certainly not my income because we\u2019re doing better. It\u2019s not that we were in financial concern, but low income job and renting rather than owning made things tight.\n\nSo while working one job I studied to get the new job. So during that time she had no interest in our lives or our income.

Every time she starts in on this subject start asking her personal questions. What you make is none of her business.

Or now that you\u2019re high earners your worth her time.\n\nAlso your husband needs to learn how to be a big boy and keep things private.", "NTA. Immediately when this started you and more so your husband should have nipped it in the bud. Telling her it's none of her business. She's a gossip, being pushy, nosey. There's literally no reason for her to know this information. It's also dangerous for her to be blabbing her mouth off to ppl. What if a friend of someone was around hearing how much you make and they decide to rob you? I know that's kinda far fetched but I honestly don't think it is so much. She's just nosey and jealous.

She is rude for continuing to pry into trying to find out what you don't want to share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep it up! and the more \"uncomfortable\" she gets around you, the better!", "NTA. That is private information and definitely none of her business. Tell your husband to handle his mother because you don\u2019t need this stress with another baby on the way .\n\nAlso tell the husband to stop giving out information from your private life! It\u2019s disrespectful to you! If he can\u2019t, then separate finances and only have a joint account for bills, expenses etc, keep your savings to yourself .", "Obviously NTA!

For all the reasons already said. Damn I relate to this one so much.", "NTA, she sounds like my sister. I still live at home with mom (I help pay bills and do my share of chores), we recently sold the apartment and sis was very curious about what it sold for. The moment she learned then pretty much phone-call after phone-call from her to mom about how much sis claimed to be struggling financially. All but demanding that mom send her about 900$ or more for some loan payment according to sis. (And based on past history she'd demand even more later and claim the first bit had to actually be spent on something else. Oopsie.)\n\nOP, you're absolutely right that MIL has no reason to know how much you make. She's probably looking to fleece you while claiming you owe it to her for her non-existent support. (Another claim my sister would happily wield, no matter how it reeks of bullshit)", "NTA\n\nYeah, I'd say she's jealous and simply nosy.", "NTA by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nYour MIL didn't care about being involved **at all** when you guys needed it, but then got a sudden interest in your lives once you were wealthier, and she's being **very invasive** about your finances. It is **not normal** for her to want to know ***exactly*** how much money is in your bank account, or your exact salaries. You are **NOT** crazy.  Your MIL is waving **so** many \ud83d\udea9 **red flags** \ud83d\udea9.\n\nAlso, she may be jealous, but it's more likely that she wants to take advantage of you, especially considering she wants to know your salaries and how much is in your bank account, the exact number thing is especially concerning. And you're **absolutely right** that if she had actually cared, she would have asked how you were doing financially when you were struggling, and could have used help.", "Absolutely agree. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s jealous, I think she\u2019s planning to ask for money (or even expecting you to pay for stuff for her)", "Disagree. OP is spot on.", "and make sure DH gets on board with this!", "That's what my mother did when I'd reached success at a ridiculously young age. It was absolutely shocking to me. It was \"my job to take care of her\", she was 54!! WTF. Some things then happened and I went no contact, best decision of my life.\n\nOP NTA", "MIL wants to know so she can plan when to move in with her son, and his wife.", "100%. I'm all for wage transparency, but this feels way too much like giving MIL the perfect excuse to demand that OP funds her lifestyle.", "NTA there\u2019s definitely something up with her demanding to know how much you make. Asking once out of curiosity is normal but not pressing it. The fact that she lives so close but doesn\u2019t want a relationship and now wants personal info? I wonder if she\u2019s been asking hubby this the whole time but now that things are changing he\u2019s not sure so she has to come to you for it? Idk but screw her. You set very normal boundaries and she\u2019s being rude and trying to bulldoze her way in. I\u2019d go nc with her and ask your hubby to please not talk about you to her and tell him you don\u2019t want to hear about her either.", "I'm leaning this way too, she's trying to \"prepare\" for her late stage of life.
