On the one side she does not help enough, on the other, she is too overbearing? I think you have to figure out what you want from A MIL and what you want from YOUR MIL? \n\nAlso, do ypu kmow why she is asking? It spunds like you were in financial trouble in the past, maybe she is concerned? Maybe this is more the field where she can and wants to be present? And if that is the case, what do you want from her?", "NTA\n\nIt's not jealousy though. She wants to brag. I guarantee if you were to talk to some of her friends and associates, they would tell you that she brags about how much money her son is making.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like she wants to know if she can ask you for money in the future.\n\nIt's time your husband have serious talk with his mom about boundaries.", "I\u2019m not searching for conflict I\u2019m asking why should I explain myself to someone who offers no help or support to our lives, especially while we\u2019ve had to struggle!\n\nThe conflict is she continues to pester about my income SINCE we\u2019ve been doing better financially. When we struggled she had no interest or care.", "I\u2019d have liked my children to have a relationship with their grandmother but they don\u2019t. She sees them very randomly and a handful of times through the year. She lives less than 5 minutes drive away from us.\n\nSo her relationship with me personally, a catch up on life. But certainly not my income because we\u2019re doing better. It\u2019s not that we were in financial concern, but low income job and renting rather than owning made things tight.\n\nSo while working one job I studied to get the new job. So during that time she had no interest in our lives or our income. It\u2019s only since we\u2019ve been doing better financially she\u2019s in touch more and it\u2019s only to ask about financial information!"]}
