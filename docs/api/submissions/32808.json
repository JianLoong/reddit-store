Immediately when this started you and more so your husband should have nipped it in the bud. Telling her it's none of her business. She's a gossip, being pushy, nosey. There's literally no reason for her to know this information. It's also dangerous for her to be blabbing her mouth off to ppl. What if a friend of someone was around hearing how much you make and they decide to rob you? I know that's kinda far fetched but I honestly don't think it is so much. She's just nosey and jealous.

I still live at home with mom (I help pay bills and do my share of chores), we recently sold the apartment and sis was very curious about what it sold for. The moment she learned then pretty much phone-call after phone-call from her to mom about how much sis claimed to be struggling financially.

(And based on past history she'd demand even more later and claim the first bit had to actually be spent on something else. Oopsie.)\n\nOP, you're absolutely right that MIL has no reason to know how much you make. She's probably looking to fleece you while claiming you owe it to her for her non-existent support.

She may just be checking you're both financially secure as she maybe can't help like she'd like to? But then maybe she is just being nosey. Congrats on the baby though :)", "NTA.  You and hubby need to sit down and have a heart to heart.  And he needs to agree to NEVER, EVER again tell his mother ANYTHING about your finances.  If he does, then go and get separate accounts.  Put the household money into a joint account, and keep the rest of your money separate and secret.", "NTA.  She's out of line, and your husband is not respecting your desires for privacy on this.  That concerns me.\n\nBut understand that you can only set boundaries with consequences.  You cannot make someone else respect them.  You just have to set it, and if they step over it, you implement the consequences.  Calmly.  You have a problem because your husband isn't respecting them.  All I can think of to avoid this is to establish a bank account without him and move half of the money to that, taking your name off the joint account and leaving it in his.  Then she doesn't know and can't know unless you tell her.  But at tax season he finds out, so...", "I\u2019m unaware of any place that it is ok to keep asking personal questions after being told nope.  \n\nPersonal is personal.

None of her beeswax. End of story.", "Completely NTA but I'm curious how your husband feels about this and if he is on your side?", "NTA. But possibly a different reason she asks. My grandparents came up during the Great Depression. My mom was one of 8 kids and the family had many lean years. I love my mom and we have a great relationship but she does ask about my money and spending sometimes. It is not her being jealous. She has plenty of her own now, but about a worry that has been \u201cbred\u201d into her whole life to live frugally and \u201cwaste not, want yet\u201d.  My husband and I both make really good money now but it is hard for my mom to not be concerned that we are wasting money sometimes. My husband has several motorcycles and started buying them before we had a great retirement fund. I get short with my mom sometimes but I take a deep breath and realize it comes from a place of love and I can acknowledge I do spend more frivolously them my parents did or generations before them. \nMaybe this is about her wanting help down the line but with relationships I care about ( my MIL is extremely difficult and we have gone our rounds but that is my husband\u2019s mother and she has not crossed a line that we couldn\u2019t come back from ) I always try to assume positive intent and not get my hackles up right away. That doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t place boundaries or follow through with those but it does mean I try to communicate first with an open mind and realize 99% of the time their reactions and how they handle things are not about me, it is based on their own experiences, histories and anxieties. \nThis could also be about your MIL bragging on you as another commenter suggested. \nMy point is that you can still set your boundaries in a respectful way and hold to them without losing the relationship totally. Many things that bugged me and still bug me about my in-laws I have worked to let go of. It doesn\u2019t mean I agree or let them walk over me but I can control how upset I get by it and that has helped immensely.", "NTA - It's not her business. If you don't want to share some personal information with someone you don't have to do so . . . at all! I do not know her motivation for asking and getting angry when she doesn't get the information she requires. Ask her! Ask her next time WHY she thinks she should know your income. Assure her you're doing fine and you don't need anything from her.", "Did yall live with her in the past? Maybe she feels you owe her something?! Idk I have an odd relationship with my MIL some people are just different,  doesn't have to be negative or positive. She should respect your boundaries even if she don't understand the reasons.  It's call coexisting with each other. She needs to understand that!", "NTA. I don't think your MIL is motivated by jealousy but I don't think she's harmlessly curious. I think she's trying to figure out if she can ask you guys for money, either soon or down the line. As long as you and your husband keep the same line \"WE DON'T DISCUSS OUR FINANCES WITH ANYONE.\" you should be just fine. She can huff and puff and demand to know how much is in each account all she wants, but if her demands are met with a calm, \"MIL, you know we're not going to answer that / MIL like we said, we don't discuss these things.\" etc you'll be just fine. \n\nYou can also calmly ask her why she's so adamant about chasing down this information, even after you've told her to stop asking. It's a violation of your privacy and a boundary you've created yet she continues to do this. Why?", "NTA\n\nI don't think it's jealousy per se. I think she wants to know how much you earn to calculate if starting to suck up to you will be worth it.", "NTA, \n\nAs already said, when you were poor it was your poverty, but now you have a bit she will want you to share it. \n\nYou need to tell hubby that any use of shared finances will have repercussions. And I would (until she dies or she shows her true colours) keep a separate personal savings account that you own and you keep the balance of. \n\nI'm not saying lie to hubby, tell him but it gives him complete plausible deniability and a father reason to tell her to wind her neck in and get back into her box.", "Nta, you need to have a serious conversation with your husband, and your mil needs to mid her business.", "NTA - I love people like this. I ALWAYS tell them how much I make.....of course I LIE!!! Tell your MIL you make $90,000. You find someone you KNOW she told this too, say your SIL, and tell her a week or so later you make $65,000. Maybe your SIL tells you your MIL told her you said to her you told her something different. Then say, \"Yeah, I lied to her.\"\n\nThen go to someone else in their circle and tell them something else. When you husband tells them something else, you can say that he doesn't really know what you make or that he is lying too. Nobody will know what the truth is.\n\nIt is great to do this...and a lot of fun!", "NTA but your husband is. He has no right sharing personal shared financial info either his mother. IF he wants to tell her how much he earns, that\u2019s his right. But shared savings, etc is off limits bc that is your shared money and marital privacy applies. Doesn\u2019t sound like she is necessarily jealous. Sounds more like she wants to wiggle into your lives and reap the benefits of your earnings. It could also be that she \u201cnow has something to brag about\u201d. Some parents think their children\u2019s success is their success. They think nothing of running around bragging to others how successful their offspring are. \n\nNeed marriage counseling to deal with spouse\u2019s loose lips.", "NTA. It is absolutely none of your MILs business knowing anything about what you earn or other financial matters. Your husband needs to stop passing on that information to her.  She may be using it to size up moving in with you and you fully support her in her old age.  What a terrible thought that would be.", "NTA \n\nEven if you give her the benefit of the doubt for the first time, to keep pressing is rude", "I agree that OP is NTA, but I think it's a leap to jump straight to \"handouts\". Some people are just *really* nosy, especially when it comes to their children. Even if their grown, they think that as parents they're entitled to ask whatever they want \"because we care!\"\n\nOP seems really resentful that MIL didn't offer them childcare or money before they were doing well, and is reacting *really* strongly to MIL's nosiness.", "She isn\u2019t jealous. There is nothing OP wrote to indicate the lady is jealous. How she jumped to that train of thought is beyond me. Jealousy would be making underhanded comments, etc. She wants to know bc she wants to brag about her son\u2019s success (bc that is HER success), she wants money from them/lining up her \u201cretirement\u201d plans or both.", "Whoops \u201c waste not, want not\u201d\u2026", "No we\u2019ve never lived with her.
