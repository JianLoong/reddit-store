The hotel, the excursions, the flights, I want to get it all for her. Problem is, I don't have the best job in the world so it won't be until 2025 or 2026 until I can gift them to her. She's wanted to go for such a long time, I'm worried if I wait too long, she'll go before I can save enough. If I don't buy my moms husband a flight, I can gift them to her quicker than if I saved for his as well (an additional $700-$1000) he's s great guy and treats my mother well and it's nothing personal. It's just time and what I can realistically save in two or three years. My sister said I'd be a dick but my boyfriend thinks if it's not feasible, I shouldn't worry about it. So, WIBTA?\n\nEdit: both him and my mom work really good jobs but the main reason I want this trip her is my grandfather passed a year ago and he wanted his ashes spread in Scotland, where his family is from.

Your mother probably won\u2019t want to go to those places by herself. She would want someone there with her.", "I think NAH but only if you include your mom's husband in the plan so that he can save for his own travel expenses to go with her. Think about it, would you want to travel abroad alone or with your partner? \nI understand it's not feasible for you to pay for both of them, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect your mom to be fine with traveling alone", "NAH - You dont have to buy them both tickets but I wouldnt buy her one without talking to her first. For starters, there\u2019s a whole lot more planning and money involved in trips so buying someone just a plane ticket, though nice, can be a problem. Additionally, she may not want to go on this trip alone.", "NTA, it\u2019s a lovely thing you\u2019re trying to do, but give the husband a heads up since he knows his and your mother\u2019s financial situation. If you\u2019re worried she\u2019s going to go on her own then she probably has enough to bring her husband. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll appreciate 50% off the holiday price!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEasy solution: \"I'm paying for half of both of you\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSame as paying for your mother. I think they'd both appreciate the gesture.", "NTA.\n  \nCould you work with him to surprise your mom? He saves for half, you save for half?\n    \nWhat kind of person is your mom? Mine needs a companion to travel and would be miserable going on her own.", "NTA, quite the opposite.\n\nI think it's best to talk to your mom's husband and figure it out with him. Assuming that he can keep a secret.", "if he is such a great guy tell him of your plan to surprise your mom so he can make arrangements for himself in time.\n\nNTA", "Info: if he\u2019s a great guy then why not give him a call and explain the situation? That way he could save for his own ticket if he wants to go with her.", "If you just buy her a ticket without taking to her first. Ywbta.  \n\nYwnbta. If you talk to her about it first. Tell her how much you are willing to spend on her. So that she can plan if she wants to accept it and go alone. Or plan it with her husband so that they have a trip together.", "NTA if you sit down with your mother\u2019s husband and explain your plan for your mother\u2019s gift and your concerns regarding not able to afford his ticket.  If he\u2019s a great guy like you stated then he should understand and might be able to afford his own way.  This actually might work out better because your mother\u2019s husband would be able to purchase his plane ticket, etc. in order to make planning this trip easier.  Good luck!!", "NTA because of the reasons stated, but best if you talk with him (away from your mom's earshot) and explain your idea and ask if he would be able to contribute for his own ticket since you will have to coordinate to buy both together if they are going to go together (if they aren't YWBTA).", "Nta and since he\u2019s a good guy just talk to him about it, he loves your mom and he\u2019ll understand. He\u2019ll likely just buy his own ticket so they can go together but you gifted your moms half for her.", "NTA. I\u2019d consider talking with her husband, explain your plan and why you want to do it for her, and explain the fact that you can\u2019t afford to include him in it at this moment. It would take you much longer to save for the both of them. I think if he\u2019s the great guy your say he is, he\u2019ll completely understand and if he can afford it, he\u2019ll take the time off work or whatever and go with her at his own expense. You don\u2019t know until you communicate with him.", "NTA make it a mothers day gift to her", "Yep, YWBTA.\n\nThat \"gift\" is going to cause a lot of friction, tension, and anger between your mother and her husband. You will have inadvertently given her a gift she cannot accept without repercussions. \n\nI suggest giving your mom something that's not going to sow division of any kind, whether it's a dream necklace, pet, or whatever else. Just not a one-person vacation when she's married.", "NTA why not talk to her husband and explain all this to him, he could very well be on board with paying his own way\n..heck he might even split the hotel cost with you", "Why not combine finances with your mothers hubby and do it as a surprise from both of you. That way you don\u2019t have to feel guilty about not paying for his ticket and your mother gets to go sooner rather than later. Let\u2019s face it, she\u2019s probably not going to want to go without him. If you saved up just for her she\u2019s going to be put in a really awkward position.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're NTA for offering to give what you can. Not sure how entitled your sister is, but that's kind of an odd leap. Just be honest about what you can do but that you'd like to do something. Maybe he covers flights then and you get hotel or something.", "My exact thoughts.", "I'll be saving for the hotel, tickets, rental car, and buying everything at least a year in advance so they can make necessary arrangements", "They both make good money so I don't think paying would be a big deal but I still would give him plenty of heads up", "I plan to tell him once I'm sure I can make it happen. Sometimes my plans fall through so I want to be solid before I start blabbing about it", "My plan was to save up then buy it a year or so out so he would have enough time to buy his own ticket.

Still...I can foresee some kind of friction, despite your good intentions.", "If she talks to him first I highly doubt there will be any friction.", "INFO: If she would rather pay for it herself so her boyfriend can go, I don't see why you are in a rush to pay for it before she does?", "Hi \u201cstep-dad\u201d I wanted to do something nice mom and pay to send her to Scotland to scatter grandpas ashes. As much as I would love to pay for both of you, I can only financially afford her trip. I know she\u2019d love for you to join her, would you be okay with footing the bill for yourself?\u201d Something along those lines could work and let him know you\u2019re still thinking of him in your act of kindness towards your mother. I\u2019d assume they have shared finances if they are married so the money you\u2019re spending on you mom could be looked at as footing half the cost of their trip. NTA and a good son/daughter", "NTA\n\nIt seems pretty reasonable that you would be willing to spend more on a gift for your mother than you would on her husband.\n\nThe trick here is that if he will be expected to cover his own share, then you need to speak to him in advance to make sure this stays as a gift towards your mother, and doesn't end up becoming an unwanted obligation for her husband (or an unwanted cost for her if she ends up paying part of his share). So let him know what you are planning, and that if he would like to join the trip (which your mother would presumably appreciate) he will have to pay his share.\n\nAs a nice gift to him to say thanks, it might be worth including him in a few of the gifts for your mother - for example organising (and paying for) a nice meal out for them both, not just your mother. After all you are putting some obligation on him too to afford this, so it would be a nice gesture.", "NTA. Talk to moms spouse. Let him know your plans. And that as much as you would like to pay for him as well you just can\u2019t afford it. This gives him time to save and join mom. And help deflect her chance of going before you can pay.", "Perhaps it can even be viewed as a common gift from you and him to your mother. Just discuss with him if he is ok and if so, how much he can contribute.", "Is a two or three year span too soon?", "That's a perfect way to say that thank you so much! I'm ngl I'm probably going to take that bar for bar haha", "But if you buy a ticket just for her there is no guarantee they can travel together. It might be better to let them plan their own trip.", "So you would be choosing the dates without discussing it ahead of time with either of them? That sounds VERY risky (especially if any or all of it is non-refundable). A lot can happen in a year. Cancel-for-any-reason insurance is worth the expense.", "I don't know...."]}
