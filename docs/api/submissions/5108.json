{"id": 5108, "submission_id": "zppsks", "title": "AITA for refusing to lie to my niece about why she is not allowed to come skiing with me?", "selftext": "I (F29) have a brother, Hugo (M31). When Hugo was 19 he got his then-girlfriend Amy pregnant. They had their daughter Ashley (now 11) and later got married and had a baby boy (4). \n\nOver the years, I've become close to Ashley. When I'm home (I live abroad) I take her out to shows, shopping, horse riding etc. We also keep in contact via text. She\u2019s bright and thoughtful, just a pleasure to have around. Amy has never liked me but has mostly put this aside for Ashley.\n\nMe and my bf are visiting my family for Christmas and then leaving to go skiing. We arranged for Ashley to come skiing and stay with us for New Years. Amy wasn't keen on this idea but relented because Ashley was excited to learn how to ski, as all her school friends do.\n\nI took my bf's hire car to pick Ashley up from school on Friday, and she was excited because it's a sports car and I let her friends sit in it and take pictures. At dinner, she asked if I would drive her to and chaperone her and her friends going ice skating on Tuesday in town. Hugo said I probably didn't want to look after a bunch of kids, and Amy had already planned to chaperone. Ashley ignored him and begged me to chaperone. I didn't really mind but Amy looked annoyed so I said I wouldn't want to mess with the established plan. Ashley kept pushing, and said she didn't want Amy to come because Amy dressed badly and was never fun and embarrassed her. Hugo told her to apologise, which she did, but she also kept insisting it was true. Amy got teary and Hugo kept telling Ashley she\u2019d upset her mother but this just made Ashley angrier and she dug her heels in. Because of this, she was told she was not allowed to go ice skating and is now not speaking to Amy.\n\nYesterday, Amy and Hugo came to me and said they didn\u2019t want Ashley to come skiing anymore. Amy feels like Ashley needs to spend more time with her family and Hugo is supporting her. They asked if I would tell Ashley that me and bf had changed our plans and wouldn\u2019t be going on the trip anymore. I asked why and they said if they told Ashley the truth that she would blame Amy and that would defeat the point of her trying to build a bridge with Ashley. I said I understand that but I didn\u2019t feel right lying to Ashley and if her parents had made the decision they need to deal with the consequences not push it onto me. Amy said if I cared about Ashley I would realise it\u2019s best for me to fall on my sword rather than alienate her further from her mother. I said no again but Hugo said we should all take until Wednesday to think about it. Ashley is still being very standoffish to her mother, and I know if she finds out her mother cancelled the ski trip it will get worse, so now I\u2019m wondering if I should go along with Amy\u2019s plan. I just want what\u2019s best for Ashley. AITA?\n\nEditing to add the background to Amy and Ashley\u2019s relationship (commented this elsewhere): A lot of it comes from Amy trying very hard to be Ashley\u2019s friend. Amy was young when she had Ashley and she was quite isolated caring for her while Hugo worked and went to uni (he was cut off by our parents at that time). She threw all her efforts into being a mum and being as close to Ashley as humanly possible. Ashley has explained to me that this has become very suffocating to her. She is trying to forge her own circle and she feels like Amy insists on being part of it, while also refusing to engage with her on her level.\n\nThe second part is that my parents pay for Ashley to attend a very prestigious private school. Hugo and Amy are nowhere near as affluent as the other families and Ashley feels a bit left out. It\u2019s part of the reason I have chipped in for some of her extra curricular activities. But the fact is, she doesn\u2019t always feel like she fits in, which is hard for her. Her school is full of non-working \u201cRange Rover/birkin\u201d mothers who are either \u201ccool\u201d or absent, and Amy is neither. She\u2019s involved but Ashley finds her stifling, and doesn\u2019t want her involved in her social life.\n\nit\u2019s also my opinion that Ashley is trying to get some emotional space from her mother only way she knows how - by making her not want to spend time with her. Amy doesn\u2019t respond to her requests so I think she\u2019s just resorting to being mean to her. Which obviously isn\u2019t okay.\n\nEdit 2 since this is being asked a lot: Ashley and I have talked since the dinner and she knows I think she shouldn\u2019t have said what she said, we\u2019ve talked about it. Even she said she shouldn\u2019t have said what she said. Did I go ham and tell her she\u2019s entitled/spoilt/throw the kitchen sink at her? No. But she knows I think she was wrong and she agree.", "created_utc": 1671451530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zppsks/aita_for_refusing_to_lie_to_my_niece_about_why/", "score": 10112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The least they could do is own up to it and live with their daughter's resentment for a few months. Because the problem is NOT the child. The problem is their messed up dynamic.\n\nEdit: I have to add double punishments are clearly messed up, and cancelling a whole trip as a punishment for a rather small argument for a normally well-behaved girl goes way overboard.\nNow it seems that the cancellation of the trip isn't supposed to be a punishment, but I guarantee you, Ashley will take it as one.

I also think she will push when OP tries to feed her BS and will end up mad at everyone.  \n\nIt sounds like Ashley is at a point where she needs boundaries and consequences. You do not speak to or about your mother like  that and there are natural consequences for that. Mom and daughter are not friends, but should be on the same team and communicating needs versus manipulating. Her not getting to do things with friends because she was rude and hurtful is normal, everyone should back mom. Ashley and mom need to learn how to discuss why this is occuring and what needs aren't being met.\n\n Also want to note that if Ashley is feeling out of place at the private school they may want to consider switching schools, these feelings will not fade and the dynamics that arise trying to fit in are not good.", "NTA. Amy needs to be a parent first. If she wants someone else to be the bad guy, it's going to have to be the dad. It's a cop out to put it on you.", "NTA, Amy needs to find common ground with her child and put more effort into her appearances at social events. Sure appearances don't matter and its what's inside that counts but Ashley will be made to feel bad Inside by others belittling her mothers appearance. \n\nRegarding common ground i actually mean she needs to find a way to bond with her daughter in something her daughter likes regardless is Amy likes it. She also needs to learn to be a mother not a friend.\n\nIf she lies, helicopters, attaches and includes herself in things Ashley doesn't want her to be part of then she'll be no contact in 7 years, the first time she's away that suffocating presence she won't look back.", "NTA. It is unfair of them to create a situation and demand others cover for them.\nYou are the \u201ccool aunt\u201d. Amy is the mom. Of course at her age she will choose you given the choice.\nAmy and Hugo need to start listening to her. She\u2019s getting close to teen years. It\u2019s reasonable that she wants some space. Advocating for her is the thing you can do in her best interests.", "NTA. It sounds like you are really trying to help your niece by giving her an outlet to discuss her feelings. I might suggest that you try to convince your brother and his wife that they should all get into family therapy, because it sounds like they could all benefit.", "Lots of issues here.  Yes, you should not lie to Ashley about you wanting to cancel the trip, but you live overseas.  You see her a few times a year whereas Amy is her mother and has to be a parent and take care of Ashley year round.  Come to a middle ground.  Ask Hugo if you can take Ashley on the ski trip and talk to Ashley heart to heart.  It\u2019s OK to have a teenager want to discover themselves and have her own space, but to be feel embarrassed by her own mother and hurt her public by and doubling down is out of line.  At the end of the day, you all care for Ashley and want her to grow up to be a good person.", "NTA for refusing to lie to your niece.. She obviously needs someone she can trust because clearly she\u2019s feeling some big feelings, especially towards her mother & her father is going along with the mom because he already knows what could transpire if he does speak up for his daughter because Amy\u2019s behavior is manipulative - to attempt to have you lie to her- leaving room to potentially vilify you later. \n\nTo touch on another point, it is HARD not to fit in especially when a child is going to a school with the kid of parents you described. If Amy is having a hard time now with her daughter, she\u2019s definitely in for it as your niece becomes an actual teenager. It is normal to be embarrassed by your parents. Is Amy intentionally injecting herself into her daughters social life to be a part of it? Or is she being overbearing? Because if she wanted to be a part of it she\u2019d want to be dressed appropriately for these social outings particularly if she knows about her daughters social struggles. \n\nI would say you should tell her the truth & console her emotions & help her sort through them the best you can because it definitely sounds like you\u2019re gonna be the one she calls when her parents other lies come to light because there\u2019s little chance that there\u2019s not more to come or that don\u2019t already exist. Break her down on it appropriately. There will be other opportunities to take her out & she\u2019s going to need you later on. Amy sounds like she\u2019s jealous/threatened of & by you as well & that\u2019s something you should stay far away from addressing because that an Amy problem.", "NTA. Lying to her is not the way to go, but wording it properly is important. Saying \"Your mom said no because she thinks you are spoiled\" would make you an AH. You are the cool Aunt, but Amy and Hugo have to deal with her when you aren't around.", "YTA. Ashley sounds like she is becoming more entitled and she is embarrassed about her mother not being wealthy to give her the things she wants. You are the cool aunt because you have money and can pick her up in fancy cars and take her on expensive ski trips which Ashley now feels is something she deserves. By not going along with the plan - you are only going to alienate her from her mother and make her even more of a spoiled brat", "You are right, you should not lie to Ashley. If her parents have decided that this a consequence of Ashley actions, they have to explain their reasons and why.\n\nThe relationship between Ashley is quite complex. Ashley is behaving like her age, starting to develop her friendship and connections. Also, given the school situation and normal peer experience and pressure, this is making it harder. \n\nIn time, Ashley will recognise what her mum means to her when she get older, but if this continues it could put a permanent wedge between them which may not repair itself\n\n\nYes, Amy was young when they had her daughter which would be hard around 18-19yrs, so needed a friend and decided to make Ashley, rather than be her mum. \n\nI get the reason why Amy did it but it cant continue, kids grow up and that means parents need to step back, give them space to experience life with them supporting. I know that it\u2019s easy to say and extremely hard to do as it include a lose as they are starting to become teens, young adults and not young kids. Ashley is clear how she feels, how much her mum wants to be involved in life and it\u2019s too much for her. \n\nTo me, Amy is trying to hold on for dear life to daughter but she is hurting herself as well as Ashley. I think Amy need some support from family or therapist, to process her feelings/emotional and look at what she needs to maintain her relationship with Ashley and what her might be missing for herself. No parents are perfect, they are human. If Amy has put her own live into Ashley, she needs support to find herself and build another side to her life\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you should pull back, by giving Ashley someone to talk about her feelings allow her to be heard and you give her a different perspective - which is really important. You tried do the best, just keep communication with your brother and Amy and share what info that Ashley is willing to share unless you are concerned about her wellbeing.", "NTA - Amy needs to go get help/ learn tools from a psychologist on how to get along with her daughter - There is no shame in this, I myself went to a psychologist for other reasons but we also talked about parenting/communication which was really helpful as my eldest was in her teen years (she's 21yrs now) & I feel it made a world of difference. Perhaps talk to Hugo about this, so Amy doesn't feel it's an attack from you, which of course it isn't.", "NTA. Sounds to me like Amy needs to grow up and stop trying to be Ashley\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d and start actually being Ashley\u2019s \u201cparent\u201d. The 2 roles are vastly different. Amy is smothering her trying to be her whole social world and she is relying on Ashley being her entire social network. \n\nMaybe Amy needs to go make some actual friends of her own and leave her daughter and her friends alone.\n\nDo not lie to Ashley for Amy\u2019s and your brother\u2019s sake. Because she will find out the truth at some point, and then she will resent you for lying to her. Tell her the truth now and show her that no matter what she can always trust you. Because further down when she\u2019s a teenager and doesn\u2019t want to ask her mom about things or bring her teenage angst problems to mom, she will think of you, because you are honest with her and she will feel she can tell you those things instead of feeling isolated and alone. As it stands now, she won\u2019t confide those teenage angst problems to her mom.\n\nWish you the best.", "NTA Have you considered mediating for them? I think you should tell the truth. I also think you should fight for her to go skiing with you. Having those experiences with you will likely help her have something in common with the bougie kids.", "NAH. \n\nI agree that it is wrong from them to lie to Ashley, but they are her parents and you should oblige. This thought obviously would not be the same if what they were doing would actually harm or neglect Ashley. They want her to have a chance to patch things up with her mother and it is completely understandable. Just do what they have asked. It\u2019s not up to you how to handle this.", "I'm sorry but Ashley sounds like a little brat who treats her mother like shit and loves spending time with u because you're the cool, rich aunt who spends money on her. You're NTA for wanting to tell her the truth hut you're TA for not telling her she's wrong for being so spoiled and cruel and rude. You have influence over her, you're making things worse by not correcting her very wrong opinions.

Do not lie to this child. Your brother and SIL are trying to force her to be nicer to her mother by taking away the number of safe family members she has.

Unless it's abusive then we step in straight away!\n\nYour niece idolises you, yes that's a huge compliment and this shouldn't be taken for granted. But this also brings the added responsibility for you to ensure that this isn't having a negative impact on her parents relationship!\n\nPlease for the sake of your family its time for you to get the full story from her parents about the difficulties they are having. Your niece is very focused on your materials in life, hiring a smart car, different clothes to her mum, going skiing etc. Have you spoken with her about how hard you work to afford all this?\n\nAlso the knock on effect this is having on your SIL, imagine being put down in front of your SIL by your own daughter, I bet your SIL dreads you coming as your niece is seeing your mum in a very negative light! \n\nPlease look at the wider picture here not just you and your niece!", "Dont lie.

Amy was young when she had Ashley and she was quite isolated caring for her while Hugo worked and went to uni (he was cut off by our parents at that time).

I didn't think this was that bad in the big scheme of things.  I've heard stories from parents about their kids saying things far worse. I'm sure I told my mom the same thing growing up.

What Ashley said wasn\u2019t great, but there\u2019s hardly a preteen on the planet that hasn\u2019t been embarrassed by their parent. She wants some space from Mom, and that\u2019s reasonable. Unfortunately it sounds like Mom isn\u2019t on board with that no matter how politely it\u2019s communicated.

It can help a LOT.

She definitely sounds disrespectful and frankly unpleasant.", "She did not,  the child said she was wrong,  the OP specifically said she didn't think it was her role to put her 2 cents in. It was her role, she didn't want to because then she wouldn't be the cool aunt anymore.", "No, it sounds like a preteen is embarrassed by her mom like most teens are at that age and wants her cool aunt to impress her friends. \n\nI think the mom feels like she\u2019s loosing her connection to her daughter and jealous of the relationship she has with her aunt, especially when she tells her \nprefers her aunt.", "Yeah let's NOT assume. Her mom probably is exhausted but is trying her best!! From the story you can tell the Aunt is trying to play the rich cool aunt and Ashley is being taught that outside appearances and flashly displays is \"important\". Sounds like her mom is a normal good mom but Ashley is comparing and disrespectful of her parent.  Parents parent, this aunt sounds like she spoils her", "Again, I don\u2019t disagree. But no one is in control of the decisions that the parents are going to make except for the parents. OP can try, but if they ultimately stand their ground, that should be respected as Ashley\u2019s parents. Even if it\u2019s not right.", "I'm wondering if Ashley has expressed her frustration with her mother before and her parents aren't listening. These are normal teenage/pre-teen feelings. Forcing her to miss out on something that was pre-planned is going to feel like a punishment to Ashley regardless of the parent's intent. Forcing her to spend time with her family and her mother is not going to improve their relationship when she's already feeling smothered and not heard. They are likely just going to alienate her more. OP certainly should not lie to cover for this as this just risks giving this poor girl no outlet for the frustration she is (legitimately) feeling. I think her being there with advice like this will only be a help during what I suspect are going to be some rough teen years ahead.", "Are you saying is normal a preteen is embarrassed her mother isn't wealthy? I understand feeling embarrassed for moms being clingy, or their actions, or just because, but for clothes brands or cars? That is just kid being disrespectful and a brat.", "It literally says they talked about it.", "You are assuming exactly as much with your point of  view as I am with mine. It's entirely possible either of us is right but we cannot get the information necessary to make that determination.\n\nAnd as callous as this sounds, that sucks for mom but if she feels that way she needs to try harder to relate to her daughter. It is not the child's responsibility to like hanging out with their parents and expecting them to at that age is fucking absurd.", "Yeah so after reading OPs edit, it does appear that Ashley is attending an expense school where clothes and brands are much more likely to determine your popularity and she needs to be taught that is unhealthy and making fun of how her mom dresses isn't acceptable. That said, Ashley is under no obligation to hang out with her mom and if Amy wants that she needs to work harder to relate to Ashley, but not by being a moron and taking away a ski trip and trying to lie about it.", "All OP should say to Ashley is \"I agree your behavior was unacceptable, and I'll respect whatever decision they make about your punishment. They're your parents so it's not my place to interfere.\" \n\nBut she shouldn't lie for them.", "Info. Why does Ashley not like you? As it stands NTA. I could understand your brother and his wife asking you to back them in the reasons for canceling the trip but it's wrong to lie.", "NTA. It's not right for them to tell you to lie.

It\u2019s not up to you what they say but you can be truthful to him. And then you have to back off. Amy and Hugo need to learn how to parent their spoiled daughter.

I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to lie to Ashley (and I don\u2019t think you should) but it sounds like you may be somewhat insensitive to Amy & her relationship with Ashley.", "It\u2019s rare that lying is the best solution.

Your niece loves your sister, but sometimes people aren\u2019t compatible. Living together every day highlights even the smallest conflicts in personality. I love my mom so much, but living with her as a teen was a nightmare. Our relationship dramatically improved when I moved away. You can still love someone you aren\u2019t compatible with. \n\n2. Of course your niece is embarrassed by her mother. She\u2019s an 11 year old girl.

I had aunts and uncles that were better off. My parents were just happy when I bonded with family. So what if they took me to something my parents regularly couldn't afford?

If you want to just cut them off then by all means, tell Ashley the whole truth and nothing but. But if you want to help her relationship with not only you but her mom (there\u2019s space in her heart for both if Amy backs off and you don\u2019t try to fill that hole with money supplements), then you\u2019ve gotta bridge that gap with Amy. \n\nYou currently know her daughter better than she does.

It definitely wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a talk with Ashley about wealth and privilege, and that not everyone has the same advantages.

Not when you\u2019re doing the kid a favor.", "From the edit, she seems like she is being suffocated by the mother. 11 is a perfectly reasonable time for a child to start discovering their independence. Perhaps she is spoiled, but not teaching her that her actions have consequences (no longer allowed to go skiing), they are doing her a diservice as her parents.", "She\u2019s desperately trying to individuate from an enmeshed mother. This is a complicated situation that most people can\u2019t fathom but having grown up with a mom who had similar lack of boundary issues with me, she lost it every time I hit new developmental milestones and would tighten her stranglehold on my life. \nI didn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t allowed to do things without her like my other friends and when I forced the separation for certain activities, I got lied to, manipulated, had major guilt trips thrown my way. She went so far as to sabotage relationships I had with other adults who were caring and kind like music and drama teachers, sports coaches, a lady I babysat for etc.\nDoes it help to understand she isn\u2019t willfully being nasty to her mom but trying desperately to breathe? Enmeshed parenting can be considered a type of abuse when it stunts a child\u2019s growth and development to cater to the parents emotional needs. \nAshley needs parents who put her needs first and get therapy to provide for their own emotional health.", "The mom is insecure and its affecting the daughter.", "Maybe she\u2019s trying to find independence (a normal 11 year old behavior) the only way she knows how?

It is unacceptable to be mean and rude to someone because they aren't rich enough for your tastes, yes, even if you're 11. The mom's behavior needs  some adjusting but the daughter is no peach.", "It seems like both things are happening. Amy is wrong to be smothering her kid and constantly inserting herself. Ashley is wrong for getting caught up in materialistic bullshit. While this behavior might be \u201cnormal\u201d for her school, that doesn\u2019t make it okay. No matter how perfectly she tries to fit in, she will probably be mocked or teased for at some point anyway (I\u2019m not excusing that behavior, simply saying that it\u2019s awfully exhausting to live your life trying to impress bullies). It would be better for her to learn that those things do not truly matter and try to find friends based on common interests who are just decent people.\n\nAs a person who grew up poor in an affluent area, there was no way for me to fit in when it came to clothing/shoes/bags/whatever. So I just had to be my own person and find friends who liked me for who I was. My mom also smothered me, and was embarrassing af. But I wouldn\u2019t be cruel to her about how she looked and had to mentally work through my own embarrassment over superficial things too.", "Yeah tbh I think the whole family caused this problem. The wealthy grandparents cut off funding making it where Amy had to stay home to take care of her then magically funding comes back to send the kid to a prestigious school where wealth is all there is to it, and surprise surprise the kid is now a brat who doesn't like her commoner mother because her dad's rich family is giving her attention. No way in hell they'd actually see this, but Amy and her husband should really look into this school because it seems like it's setting their daughter up for failure. Like it or not she's not wealthy having her in an environment like this in her formulative years could be encouraging her to engage in risky behaviour simply to match her peers. Especially since she's latched on to her aunt who shows up in a sports car for a photo opt and an expensive ski trip. The daughter seems to be picking up some very concerning behaviour.", "Enough with the pearl clutching, honestly.", "Why would I ask her that? That\u2019s for her parents to decide, not either of us. She has apologised but she won\u2019t speak to Amy beyond good morning and answering questions.", "That seems like a wild leap.  Sure sometimes people lose jobs but I doubt most think, \"oh this happened because I said something that hurt my mom's feelings as a teenager.\" \n\nIt's highly unlikely that your kid will go through their entire life never hurting your feelings, if so, consider yourself truly lucky.  My stepkid is still very young and has already said hurtful things to me and my husband.  We try to let it roll off our backs because the kid is just being a kid.  We still love the kiddo and I think we both understand that there are certain actions we can take that will help us bond with the kiddo and certain actions we could take that would be counterproductive to bonding with the kiddo.  \n\nWhat Amy and Hugo are doing is HUGELY counterproductive.", "You seem to be projecting some personal issues here.

It was an invite to my friend NOT her parents as well.  They weren't \"excluded\" but they weren't friends with my parents so it didn't make sense to invite them too.

She was a really nice lady, just not ready to let her kid start preparing to leave the nest. \n\nThe result was that my friend started pushing her away the only way she knew how, by being mean.

Ashley told her mom she thinks she's uncool because of how she dresses, but she told her aunt it's because her mom tries to insert herself into her social circle and act like a friend instead of a mom. And the second reason is completely valid. She could be getting social pushback from her friends, or she could just feel uncomfortable and not supported like she should be as a child with a parent.\n\nI think OP should talk to her brother about this, because Ashley isn't old enough to navigate how she's feeling and communicate it to her mother on her own.

The disconnect between normal life and a privileged environment (with peers from different economic strata) can be quite disorienting for children and lead to feelings of \"embarrassment\" that are quite outside the norm.

Why won't you let me go?\")\n\nIn this instance, OP is absolutely NTA for (a) offering Ashley experiences her parents cannot and (b) not wanting to lie to her, but Amy is equally NTA for not wanting to alienate her daughter further.

Of course an aunt who feels and acts like a jet setter is going to draw all sorts of adoration from an 11 year old girl, much to the chagrin of her own parents - because 11/12 year old girls can be really, really shallow. This is a tween thing, not a \"we had kids too young and need to pull apart the psychology of the situation\" thing.\n\nDid mom and dad manage this properly? Nah, they didn't.

She should still apologize and should know that what she said to her mother isn't okay, but are we seriously placing more blame on a *child* than on the two grown adults that are raising her??", "This was my take too.  This feels like a therapy issue as there are serious issues with Amy and Ashley that this is not really the forum to flesh things out in.  \n\nAshley may be a pre-teen who sees themselves as the center of the world, but sounds like some other stuff going on beyond that.

Shit my mom was a junkie my whole life, from being a crack head to a pill popper with all that comes with it and I never disrespected her in front of people. But OP is NTA idk why the parents just don't let her know that her actions is what made her not be able to go. Maybe that is one of the reasons why she acts like that?", "Agreed.  I actually don't think her parents are AH's for punishing her.  Eleven and twelve are just.....the worst ages, and it's a fine line to find the balance between just rolling your eyes at general tweenage shittiness versus curbing some really bad habits that will only get worse the older she gets.\n\nThat being said, if it's going to be a punishment, then it needs to be a clear punishment.  Having Auntie take the blame with a vague excuse for canceling teaches nothing, and it unfairly brings Auntie into a parenting situation that she, frankly, has no business being in. \n\nSomebody above mentioned some potential \"missing missing reasons\" and some hints of classism, as well as a pre-existing dislike for Amy coming from OP....and I kind of have to agree.  I'll withhold judgment, since we don't really have the full picture IMO, but it feels like there could be more behind this than just \"Amy's trying too hard to be a COOL mom, not a regular mom.\"", "I would agree if she hadn\u2019t already been punished for that. She already had an ice skating trip taken away for that behavior so not letting her go skiing as well would just be piling on even more punishment. While she was in the wrong and shouldn\u2019t have behaved that way it just doesn\u2019t seem proportionate to continue punishing her for that one incident. I think if it\u2019s true they just want her to spend more time with her parents they should start implementing that after the trip because they\u2019re right that if she knows they\u2019re the reason she can\u2019t go she\u2019ll blame her mother and she\u2019ll become even more resistant to the relationship", "The vast majority of girls start to crave distance from their mothers at this age so they can develop some individuality and independence.

Is there a possible olive branch you could extend to begin to repair the relationship and get to the bottom of it?", "It's probably tough on her being in a private school. She needs to be taught that money doesn't define people's worth  for sure \n\nHowever, if it wasn't that, it would be something else.

OP seems to be authentic and respects her and treats her at eye level. The mother is trying to manipulate her into doing her bidding / trying to force her to spend more time with her and even trying to convince other people to lie and be as unauthentic as she is herself. It's no wonder there's no trust base and Ashley's looking for a trustworthy adult elsewhere.\n\nParents who parent \"top-down\" approach will eventually reap what they sow. I feel an odd mix of amusement and pity when I see a teen parent become panicky and more manipulative when they start to realize that their parenting based on dependency and force has formed no emotional bond, and as soon as the kids grow out of the parental influence zone, the parents don't know how to get them back without a leash.", ">instead of sitting down to figure out why she\u2019s feeling this way.\n\nBecause they already know why she's feeling this way but don't want to address it. The mom has made herself emotionally dependent on her daughter and is suffocating her with the demand to be \"best friends\".

Maybe to reword it again - I think you read \"You're not supposed to feel that way\" as \"you're supposed to not feel that way\", as opposed to neutralizing the idea that you are *supposed* to feel that way. Like \"I disagree that's specifically the way you are supposed to feel\" rather than \"you are supposed to feel another way.\" It's more a passive dispute than actively arguing for the opposite.

Ashley\u2019s behavior could be a reasonable response to this an an attempt to establish healthier distance from her mother. \n\nEither way, having a trusted adult in Ashley\u2019s life is vitally important.

It is NORMAL for pre-teens and teenagers to feel embarrassed by their parents, even when it is just as benign as getting dropped off for ice skating.

This is normal and should be carefully encouraged in a safe environment.\n\nSince Ashely is already aware of the financial difference between herself and her cohorts at school, this could be a starting point for understanding bigger concepts as well, like priviledge, socioeconomic differences etc. Obviously, don't discuss them at a college level, but at her own.
