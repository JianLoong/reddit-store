{"id": 5108, "submission_id": "zppsks", "title": "AITA for refusing to lie to my niece about why she is not allowed to come skiing with me?", "selftext": "I (F29) have a brother, Hugo (M31). When Hugo was 19 he got his then-girlfriend Amy pregnant. They had their daughter Ashley (now 11) and later got married and had a baby boy (4). \n\nOver the years, I've become close to Ashley. When I'm home (I live abroad) I take her out to shows, shopping, horse riding etc. We also keep in contact via text. She\u2019s bright and thoughtful, just a pleasure to have around. Amy has never liked me but has mostly put this aside for Ashley.\n\nMe and my bf are visiting my family for Christmas and then leaving to go skiing. We arranged for Ashley to come skiing and stay with us for New Years. Amy wasn't keen on this idea but relented because Ashley was excited to learn how to ski, as all her school friends do.\n\nI took my bf's hire car to pick Ashley up from school on Friday, and she was excited because it's a sports car and I let her friends sit in it and take pictures. At dinner, she asked if I would drive her to and chaperone her and her friends going ice skating on Tuesday in town. Hugo said I probably didn't want to look after a bunch of kids, and Amy had already planned to chaperone. Ashley ignored him and begged me to chaperone. I didn't really mind but Amy looked annoyed so I said I wouldn't want to mess with the established plan. Ashley kept pushing, and said she didn't want Amy to come because Amy dressed badly and was never fun and embarrassed her. Hugo told her to apologise, which she did, but she also kept insisting it was true. Amy got teary and Hugo kept telling Ashley she\u2019d upset her mother but this just made Ashley angrier and she dug her heels in. Because of this, she was told she was not allowed to go ice skating and is now not speaking to Amy.\n\nYesterday, Amy and Hugo came to me and said they didn\u2019t want Ashley to come skiing anymore. Amy feels like Ashley needs to spend more time with her family and Hugo is supporting her. They asked if I would tell Ashley that me and bf had changed our plans and wouldn\u2019t be going on the trip anymore. I asked why and they said if they told Ashley the truth that she would blame Amy and that would defeat the point of her trying to build a bridge with Ashley. I said I understand that but I didn\u2019t feel right lying to Ashley and if her parents had made the decision they need to deal with the consequences not push it onto me. Amy said if I cared about Ashley I would realise it\u2019s best for me to fall on my sword rather than alienate her further from her mother. I said no again but Hugo said we should all take until Wednesday to think about it. Ashley is still being very standoffish to her mother, and I know if she finds out her mother cancelled the ski trip it will get worse, so now I\u2019m wondering if I should go along with Amy\u2019s plan. I just want what\u2019s best for Ashley. AITA?\n\nEditing to add the background to Amy and Ashley\u2019s relationship (commented this elsewhere): A lot of it comes from Amy trying very hard to be Ashley\u2019s friend. Amy was young when she had Ashley and she was quite isolated caring for her while Hugo worked and went to uni (he was cut off by our parents at that time). She threw all her efforts into being a mum and being as close to Ashley as humanly possible. Ashley has explained to me that this has become very suffocating to her. She is trying to forge her own circle and she feels like Amy insists on being part of it, while also refusing to engage with her on her level.\n\nThe second part is that my parents pay for Ashley to attend a very prestigious private school. Hugo and Amy are nowhere near as affluent as the other families and Ashley feels a bit left out. It\u2019s part of the reason I have chipped in for some of her extra curricular activities. But the fact is, she doesn\u2019t always feel like she fits in, which is hard for her. Her school is full of non-working \u201cRange Rover/birkin\u201d mothers who are either \u201ccool\u201d or absent, and Amy is neither. She\u2019s involved but Ashley finds her stifling, and doesn\u2019t want her involved in her social life.\n\nit\u2019s also my opinion that Ashley is trying to get some emotional space from her mother only way she knows how - by making her not want to spend time with her. Amy doesn\u2019t respond to her requests so I think she\u2019s just resorting to being mean to her. Which obviously isn\u2019t okay.", "created_utc": 1671451530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zppsks/aita_for_refusing_to_lie_to_my_niece_about_why/", "score": 745, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There might even be a financial twist. Ashley feels left out at her school cause her parents are not as wealthy as her classmates parents, so being less wealthy makes her feel embarrassed, which amy is obviously aware of (if not before then definitely after ashleys comment). This probably makes amy envy OP even more, since OP is not only fun and has a close bond with ashley, but also has the financial means to provide for activites/outings/trips that make ashley feel less left out.

Prohibiting the ski vacation because Amy feels hurt is a classic knee jerk emotional response to misbehavior that will only make their relationship worse.", "NTA they need to continue to parent and take the good with the bad. But you should tell Amy everything in that last paragraph and tell her to get her own life. Your niece is at that age where them pull away from parents and start working being a tween. Also best to be the parent and let you as the aunt be the friend because in my opinion you can\u2019t be both.", "NTA, and I agree with many of the comments saying this is typical behavior for the age. I also think she will push when OP tries to feed her BS and will end up mad at everyone.  \n\nIt sounds like Ashley is at a point where she needs boundaries and consequences. You do not speak to or about your mother like  that and there are natural consequences for that. Mom and daughter are not friends, but should be on the same team and communicating needs versus manipulating. Her not getting to do things with friends because she was rude and hurtful is normal, everyone should back mom. Ashley and mom need to learn how to discuss why this is occuring and what needs aren't being met.\n\n Also want to note that if Ashley is feeling out of place at the private school they may want to consider switching schools, these feelings will not fade and the dynamics that arise trying to fit in are not good.", "NTA.

Sure appearances don't matter and its what's inside that counts but Ashley will be made to feel bad Inside by others belittling her mothers appearance. \n\nRegarding common ground i actually mean she needs to find a way to bond with her daughter in something her daughter likes regardless is Amy likes it. She also needs to learn to be a mother not a friend.\n\nIf she lies, helicopters, attaches and includes herself in things Ashley doesn't want her to be part of then she'll be no contact in 7 years, the first time she's away that suffocating presence she won't look back.", "NTA. It is unfair of them to create a situation and demand others cover for them.\nYou are the \u201ccool aunt\u201d. Amy is the mom. Of course at her age she will choose you given the choice.\nAmy and Hugo need to start listening to her. She\u2019s getting close to teen years. It\u2019s reasonable that she wants some space. Advocating for her is the thing you can do in her best interests.", "NTA. It sounds like you are really trying to help your niece by giving her an outlet to discuss her feelings. I might suggest that you try to convince your brother and his wife that they should all get into family therapy, because it sounds like they could all benefit.", "Lots of issues here.  Yes, you should not lie to Ashley about you wanting to cancel the trip, but you live overseas.  You see her a few times a year whereas Amy is her mother and has to be a parent and take care of Ashley year round.  Come to a middle ground.  Ask Hugo if you can take Ashley on the ski trip and talk to Ashley heart to heart.  It\u2019s OK to have a teenager want to discover themselves and have her own space, but to be feel embarrassed by her own mother and hurt her public by and doubling down is out of line.  At the end of the day, you all care for Ashley and want her to grow up to be a good person.", "NTA for refusing to lie to your niece.. She obviously needs someone she can trust because clearly she\u2019s feeling some big feelings, especially towards her mother & her father is going along with the mom because he already knows what could transpire if he does speak up for his daughter because Amy\u2019s behavior is manipulative - to attempt to have you lie to her- leaving room to potentially vilify you later. \n\nTo touch on another point, it is HARD not to fit in especially when a child is going to a school with the kid of parents you described. If Amy is having a hard time now with her daughter, she\u2019s definitely in for it as your niece becomes an actual teenager. It is normal to be embarrassed by your parents. Is Amy intentionally injecting herself into her daughters social life to be a part of it? Or is she being overbearing? Because if she wanted to be a part of it she\u2019d want to be dressed appropriately for these social outings particularly if she knows about her daughters social struggles. \n\nI would say you should tell her the truth & console her emotions & help her sort through them the best you can because it definitely sounds like you\u2019re gonna be the one she calls when her parents other lies come to light because there\u2019s little chance that there\u2019s not more to come or that don\u2019t already exist. Break her down on it appropriately. There will be other opportunities to take her out & she\u2019s going to need you later on.

You are the cool aunt because you have money and can pick her up in fancy cars and take her on expensive ski trips which Ashley now feels is something she deserves. By not going along with the plan - you are only going to alienate her from her mother and make her even more of a spoiled brat", "You are right, you should not lie to Ashley. If her parents have decided that this a consequence of Ashley actions, they have to explain their reasons and why.\n\nThe relationship between Ashley is quite complex. Ashley is behaving like her age, starting to develop her friendship and connections. Also, given the school situation and normal peer experience and pressure, this is making it harder. \n\nIn time, Ashley will recognise what her mum means to her when she get older, but if this continues it could put a permanent wedge between them which may not repair itself\n\n\nYes, Amy was young when they had her daughter which would be hard around 18-19yrs, so needed a friend and decided to make Ashley, rather than be her mum. \n\nI get the reason why Amy did it but it cant continue, kids grow up and that means parents need to step back, give them space to experience life with them supporting. I know that it\u2019s easy to say and extremely hard to do as it include a lose as they are starting to become teens, young adults and not young kids. Ashley is clear how she feels, how much her mum wants to be involved in life and it\u2019s too much for her. \n\nTo me, Amy is trying to hold on for dear life to daughter but she is hurting herself as well as Ashley. I think Amy need some support from family or therapist, to process her feelings/emotional and look at what she needs to maintain her relationship with Ashley and what her might be missing for herself. No parents are perfect, they are human. If Amy has put her own live into Ashley, she needs support to find herself and build another side to her life\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you should pull back, by giving Ashley someone to talk about her feelings allow her to be heard and you give her a different perspective - which is really important. You tried do the best, just keep communication with your brother and Amy and share what info that Ashley is willing to share unless you are concerned about her wellbeing.", "NTA - Amy needs to go get help/ learn tools from a psychologist on how to get along with her daughter - There is no shame in this, I myself went to a psychologist for other reasons but we also talked about parenting/communication which was really helpful as my eldest was in her teen years (she's 21yrs now) & I feel it made a world of difference. Perhaps talk to Hugo about this, so Amy doesn't feel it's an attack from you, which of course it isn't.", "NTA.

Amy is smothering her trying to be her whole social world and she is relying on Ashley being her entire social network. \n\nMaybe Amy needs to go make some actual friends of her own and leave her daughter and her friends alone.\n\nDo not lie to Ashley for Amy\u2019s and your brother\u2019s sake.

Because further down when she\u2019s a teenager and doesn\u2019t want to ask her mom about things or bring her teenage angst problems to mom, she will think of you, because you are honest with her and she will feel she can tell you those things instead of feeling isolated and alone.

What Ashley said wasn\u2019t great, but there\u2019s hardly a preteen on the planet that hasn\u2019t been embarrassed by their parent. She wants some space from Mom, and that\u2019s reasonable. Unfortunately it sounds like Mom isn\u2019t on board with that no matter how politely it\u2019s communicated. One thing you can suggest to Ashley is saying \u201cI need some space to calm down, can we talk about this in 10 minutes?\u201d and going to her room, the bathroom, etc for a bit when she realizes she\u2019s getting upset. It can help a LOT. However, only do this if you think the parents will respect it and not yell at her for leaving or try to follow her.", "I think you should have insisted she apologized to her mother. She definitely sounds disrespectful and frankly unpleasant.", "She did not,  the child said she was wrong,  the OP specifically said she didn't think it was her role to put her 2 cents in. It was her role, she didn't want to because then she wouldn't be the cool aunt anymore.", "No, it sounds like a preteen is embarrassed by her mom like most teens are at that age and wants her cool aunt to impress her friends. \n\nI think the mom feels like she\u2019s loosing her connection to her daughter and jealous of the relationship she has with her aunt, especially when she tells her \nprefers her aunt.", "Yeah let's NOT assume. Her mom probably is exhausted but is trying her best!! From the story you can tell the Aunt is trying to play the rich cool aunt and Ashley is being taught that outside appearances and flashly displays is \"important\". Sounds like her mom is a normal good mom but Ashley is comparing and disrespectful of her parent.  Parents parent, this aunt sounds like she spoils her", "Again, I don\u2019t disagree. But no one is in control of the decisions that the parents are going to make except for the parents. OP can try, but if they ultimately stand their ground, that should be respected as Ashley\u2019s parents. Even if it\u2019s not right.", "I'm wondering if Ashley has expressed her frustration with her mother before and her parents aren't listening. These are normal teenage/pre-teen feelings. Forcing her to miss out on something that was pre-planned is going to feel like a punishment to Ashley regardless of the parent's intent. Forcing her to spend time with her family and her mother is not going to improve their relationship when she's already feeling smothered and not heard. They are likely just going to alienate her more. OP certainly should not lie to cover for this as this just risks giving this poor girl no outlet for the frustration she is (legitimately) feeling. I think her being there with advice like this will only be a help during what I suspect are going to be some rough teen years ahead.", "Are you saying is normal a preteen is embarrassed her mother isn't wealthy? I understand feeling embarrassed for moms being clingy, or their actions, or just because, but for clothes brands or cars? That is just kid being disrespectful and a brat.", "It literally says they talked about it.", "You are assuming exactly as much with your point of  view as I am with mine. It's entirely possible either of us is right but we cannot get the information necessary to make that determination.\n\nAnd as callous as this sounds, that sucks for mom but if she feels that way she needs to try harder to relate to her daughter. It is not the child's responsibility to like hanging out with their parents and expecting them to at that age is fucking absurd.", "Yeah so after reading OPs edit, it does appear that Ashley is attending an expense school where clothes and brands are much more likely to determine your popularity and she needs to be taught that is unhealthy and making fun of how her mom dresses isn't acceptable. That said, Ashley is under no obligation to hang out with her mom and if Amy wants that she needs to work harder to relate to Ashley, but not by being a moron and taking away a ski trip and trying to lie about it.", "All OP should say to Ashley is \"I agree your behavior was unacceptable, and I'll respect whatever decision they make about your punishment. They're your parents so it's not my place to interfere.\" \n\nBut she shouldn't lie for them."]}
