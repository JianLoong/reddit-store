When Hugo was 19 he got his then-girlfriend Amy pregnant. They had their daughter Ashley (now 11) and later got married and had a baby boy (4). \n\nOver the years, I've become close to Ashley. When I'm home (I live abroad) I take her out to shows, shopping, horse riding etc. We also keep in contact via text. She\u2019s bright and thoughtful, just a pleasure to have around. Amy has never liked me but has mostly put this aside for Ashley.\n\nMe and my bf are visiting my family for Christmas and then leaving to go skiing. We arranged for Ashley to come skiing and stay with us for New Years. Amy wasn't keen on this idea but relented because Ashley was excited to learn how to ski, as all her school friends do.\n\nI took my bf's hire car to pick Ashley up from school on Friday, and she was excited because it's a sports car and I let her friends sit in it and take pictures. At dinner, she asked if I would drive her to and chaperone her and her friends going ice skating on Tuesday in town. Hugo said I probably didn't want to look after a bunch of kids, and Amy had already planned to chaperone. Ashley ignored him and begged me to chaperone. I didn't really mind but Amy looked annoyed so I said I wouldn't want to mess with the established plan. Ashley kept pushing, and said she didn't want Amy to come because Amy dressed badly and was never fun and embarrassed her. Hugo told her to apologise, which she did, but she also kept insisting it was true. Amy got teary and Hugo kept telling Ashley she\u2019d upset her mother but this just made Ashley angrier and she dug her heels in. Because of this, she was told she was not allowed to go ice skating and is now not speaking to Amy.\n\nYesterday, Amy and Hugo came to me and said they didn\u2019t want Ashley to come skiing anymore. Amy feels like Ashley needs to spend more time with her family and Hugo is supporting her. They asked if I would tell Ashley that me and bf had changed our plans and wouldn\u2019t be going on the trip anymore. I asked why and they said if they told Ashley the truth that she would blame Amy and that would defeat the point of her trying to build a bridge with Ashley. I said I understand that but I didn\u2019t feel right lying to Ashley and if her parents had made the decision they need to deal with the consequences not push it onto me. Amy said if I cared about Ashley I would realise it\u2019s best for me to fall on my sword rather than alienate her further from her mother. I said no again but Hugo said we should all take until Wednesday to think about it. Ashley is still being very standoffish to her mother, and I know if she finds out her mother cancelled the ski trip it will get worse, so now I\u2019m wondering if I should go along with Amy\u2019s plan. I just want what\u2019s best for Ashley.

I think you're doing everything right - yeah, Ashley is acting out and parents need to figure it out but lying is not the way. What she said was very cruel, considering it was her own mother, and if they want her punishment to be no skiing trip then so be it.\n\nBut, if they just want to limit /cancel interactions of the child with their uncle that certainly won't help anyone.

At the minimum, four people will know about their lie\u2014Ashley\u2019s parents, the OP and her bf. Is the OP expected to lie to everyone who asks her why Ashley isn\u2019t going skiing?

They need to work on their communication with Ashley and teach her to keep rude opinions of others to herself and not lash out or make comparisons. They won't be comuncsting with her AT ALL if they don't allow her to go on the trip with you, it would only further hurt their relationship with her and drag you into it. Hold your ground OP!\nPerhaps you and Amy can go somewhere with Ashley all together sometime to help everyone get along better \ud83e\udd17 ideal world of course where everyone's happy and prancing on rainbows.

If she found out that you lied to her, you will be part of the same boat her mom is in and the relationship you have with her will start deteriorating. Tell the truth and ask her to suck up to her mom to be able to go skiing and somehow maintain the peace at home if she wants to do cool things.", "NTA \n\nLike you said, they made the decision, they have to deal with it.\n\nHowever, I think it's absolutely crappy to promise a kid a trip and then backpedal spontaneously because her mother is jealous.

It has nothing to do with not loving their mom.\n\nIf their relationship is strained it's certainly not just because of you.\n\nCancelling the skiing trip the kid was looking forward to because her mother feels insecure is pretty messed up. The least they could do is own up to it and live with their daughter's resentment for a few months. Because the problem is NOT the child. The problem is their messed up dynamic.\n\nEdit: I have to add double punishments are clearly messed up, and cancelling a whole trip as a punishment for a rather small argument for a normally well-behaved girl goes way overboard.\nNow it seems that the cancellation of the trip isn't supposed to be a punishment, but I guarantee you, Ashley will take it as one. And deep inside Amy might act from a place of resentment.", "NTA.\n\nAshley sounds like a little tick, to be honest; Amy and Hugo are not wrong to cancel the trip, if only to teach her a lesson about how to function in a family.  But dishonesty is no way to coerce a child into mother-love.\n\nHugo and Amy need to own up to their own decisions.  They should tell her, \"You're not going because you're being a total asshole to your mother,\" and not put you in the position of pointlessly alienating her.", "NTA, why should you ruin your relationship with your niece just because the mother wants to build up a better  one. She has plenty of opportunities to try and get closer to her daughter, why cancel a ski trip that she has clearly been looking forward to and then force you to take the blame.", "There is bigger problem here then you, you need to ask Hugo Why  Ashley dont like her  mother.    Ashley will still blame her mother  for not going on this trip, this solves nothing.

There\u2019s enough shallow disrespectful adults in this world. Hopefully it\u2019s not too late and Ashley won\u2019t join their ranks IF she learns from this. Actions, in this case verbal abuse, have consequences which should not include a ski vacation! \n\nFrankly, you don\u2019t seem disturbed with her behavior. Rather you report her behavior objectively but take umbrage with your sister-in-law\u2019s desperate plea for you to lie. Although I don\u2019t think you should do so, I think as a beloved aunt, you should have a stern talk with Ashley and tell her she needs to be punished for what she did. \n\nWhat she said is really fucked up! Why aren\u2019t you horrified with her behavior? Is it because Amy never liked you? \nDon\u2019t lie. But don\u2019t act like what she said is a small thing. Amy\u2019s devastated and rightly so. If Ashley\u2019s acting like this at 11, imagine what 13 Will bring if she is allowed to behave in this cruel way without major consequences. \n\nNot going is 100% on Ashley and you should tell her so.", "NTA.\n\nJust bow out of this as best you can.  Don't make it a point to announce the reasoning to your niece, but also let them know that if you're asked specifically by her about it, you won't be lying about it.\n\nTry to distance yourself right now so that they can't make you the scapegoat for the lousy relationship Amy has with her own child.  Because believe me they'll want to blame anyone other than themselves for that, and you're SUCH an easy target since Amy already doesn't like you.\n\nJust send the kid stuff so that she knows she's still on your mind and that you care about her.  Perhaps a gift card where she can purchase things online so that her mother doesn't have to join her for her to use it, or gifts specific to her interests sent to her home and addressed specifically to her. \n\nAmy's bad relationship with her daughter has nothing to do with you.  It's just that Hugo and Amy are too blind to realize that fact.", "NTA\n\nSomeone needs to straighten that girl out. She needs to learn that when she acts inappropriately there are consequences from everyone unanimously in her life. You act like an entitled brat and you don't get to go on special trips, the end.", "NAH - I don't think anyone here has done much wrong yet in this situation (apart from Ashley but she's just a kid). You were just trying to have a fun time with your niece and Amy was just wounded by her daughter rejecting her in favour of you. I can see why they wouldn't want her to go on the trip (maybe you could all go skiing together at some point?)\n\nI think going forward it would be best if you, Amy and Hugo put on a united front, you really should have a word with Ashley about respecting her Mother. You should work together to try and avoid widening the divide between you and Amy. Obviously cancelling the trip and saying it was all her parent's idea will cause more fiction. I think it would be best for everyone involved if it portrayed as a joint decision.", "YTA for ignoring/supporting Ashley's shallow views.

I\u2019ve spoken to her at length about things with her mother and she knows she was wrong to say what she said, but there\u2019s a lot of feelings there, she\u2019s not a mean kid, she is just dealing with the very difficult job of growing up", "No, my parents are paying for Ashley\u2019s schooling. I am not justifying her actions, I am understand why she is acting like that. It doesn\u2019t make it right, but behaviour doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, and she is a *child*.\n\nFair enough if you think I\u2019m an AH in general, or for not lying to her, but I won\u2019t be goaded into passing judgement on a literal child."]}
