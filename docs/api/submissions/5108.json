{"id": 5108, "submission_id": "zppsks", "title": "AITA for refusing to lie to my niece about why she is not allowed to come skiing with me?", "selftext": "I (F29) have a brother, Hugo (M31). When Hugo was 19 he got his then-girlfriend Amy pregnant. They had their daughter Ashley (now 11) and later got married and had a baby boy (4). \n\nOver the years, I've become close to Ashley. When I'm home (I live abroad) I take her out to shows, shopping, horse riding etc. We also keep in contact via text. She\u2019s bright and thoughtful, just a pleasure to have around. Amy has never liked me but has mostly put this aside for Ashley.\n\nMe and my bf are visiting my family for Christmas and then leaving to go skiing. We arranged for Ashley to come skiing and stay with us for New Years. Amy wasn't keen on this idea but relented because Ashley was excited to learn how to ski, as all her school friends do.\n\nI took my bf's hire car to pick Ashley up from school on Friday, and she was excited because it's a sports car and I let her friends sit in it and take pictures. At dinner, she asked if I would drive her to and chaperone her and her friends going ice skating on Tuesday in town. Hugo said I probably didn't want to look after a bunch of kids, and Amy had already planned to chaperone. Ashley ignored him and begged me to chaperone. I didn't really mind but Amy looked annoyed so I said I wouldn't want to mess with the established plan. Ashley kept pushing, and said she didn't want Amy to come because Amy dressed badly and was never fun and embarrassed her. Hugo told her to apologise, which she did, but she also kept insisting it was true. Amy got teary and Hugo kept telling Ashley she\u2019d upset her mother but this just made Ashley angrier and she dug her heels in. Because of this, she was told she was not allowed to go ice skating and is now not speaking to Amy.\n\nYesterday, Amy and Hugo came to me and said they didn\u2019t want Ashley to come skiing anymore. Amy feels like Ashley needs to spend more time with her family and Hugo is supporting her. They asked if I would tell Ashley that me and bf had changed our plans and wouldn\u2019t be going on the trip anymore. I asked why and they said if they told Ashley the truth that she would blame Amy and that would defeat the point of her trying to build a bridge with Ashley. I said I understand that but I didn\u2019t feel right lying to Ashley and if her parents had made the decision they need to deal with the consequences not push it onto me. Amy said if I cared about Ashley I would realise it\u2019s best for me to fall on my sword rather than alienate her further from her mother. I said no again but Hugo said we should all take until Wednesday to think about it. Ashley is still being very standoffish to her mother, and I know if she finds out her mother cancelled the ski trip it will get worse, so now I\u2019m wondering if I should go along with Amy\u2019s plan. I just want what\u2019s best for Ashley. AITA?\n\nEditing to add the background to Amy and Ashley\u2019s relationship (commented this elsewhere): A lot of it comes from Amy trying very hard to be Ashley\u2019s friend. Amy was young when she had Ashley and she was quite isolated caring for her while Hugo worked and went to uni (he was cut off by our parents at that time). She threw all her efforts into being a mum and being as close to Ashley as humanly possible. Ashley has explained to me that this has become very suffocating to her. She is trying to forge her own circle and she feels like Amy insists on being part of it, while also refusing to engage with her on her level.\n\nThe second part is that my parents pay for Ashley to attend a very prestigious private school. Hugo and Amy are nowhere near as affluent as the other families and Ashley feels a bit left out. It\u2019s part of the reason I have chipped in for some of her extra curricular activities. But the fact is, she doesn\u2019t always feel like she fits in, which is hard for her. Her school is full of non-working \u201cRange Rover/birkin\u201d mothers who are either \u201ccool\u201d or absent, and Amy is neither. She\u2019s involved but Ashley finds her stifling, and doesn\u2019t want her involved in her social life.\n\nit\u2019s also my opinion that Ashley is trying to get some emotional space from her mother only way she knows how - by making her not want to spend time with her. Amy doesn\u2019t respond to her requests so I think she\u2019s just resorting to being mean to her. Which obviously isn\u2019t okay.", "created_utc": 1671451530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zppsks/aita_for_refusing_to_lie_to_my_niece_about_why/", "score": 2966, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There might even be a financial twist. Ashley feels left out at her school cause her parents are not as wealthy as her classmates parents, so being less wealthy makes her feel embarrassed, which amy is obviously aware of (if not before then definitely after ashleys comment). This probably makes amy envy OP even more, since OP is not only fun and has a close bond with ashley, but also has the financial means to provide for activites/outings/trips that make ashley feel less left out.

Prohibiting the ski vacation because Amy feels hurt is a classic knee jerk emotional response to misbehavior that will only make their relationship worse.", "NTA they need to continue to parent and take the good with the bad. But you should tell Amy everything in that last paragraph and tell her to get her own life. Your niece is at that age where them pull away from parents and start working being a tween. Also best to be the parent and let you as the aunt be the friend because in my opinion you can\u2019t be both.", "NTA, and I agree with many of the comments saying this is typical behavior for the age. I also think she will push when OP tries to feed her BS and will end up mad at everyone.  \n\nIt sounds like Ashley is at a point where she needs boundaries and consequences. You do not speak to or about your mother like  that and there are natural consequences for that. Mom and daughter are not friends, but should be on the same team and communicating needs versus manipulating. Her not getting to do things with friends because she was rude and hurtful is normal, everyone should back mom. Ashley and mom need to learn how to discuss why this is occuring and what needs aren't being met.\n\n Also want to note that if Ashley is feeling out of place at the private school they may want to consider switching schools, these feelings will not fade and the dynamics that arise trying to fit in are not good.", "NTA. Amy needs to be a parent first. If she wants someone else to be the bad guy, it's going to have to be the dad. It's a cop out to put it on you.", "NTA, Amy needs to find common ground with her child and put more effort into her appearances at social events. Sure appearances don't matter and its what's inside that counts but Ashley will be made to feel bad Inside by others belittling her mothers appearance. \n\nRegarding common ground i actually mean she needs to find a way to bond with her daughter in something her daughter likes regardless is Amy likes it. She also needs to learn to be a mother not a friend.\n\nIf she lies, helicopters, attaches and includes herself in things Ashley doesn't want her to be part of then she'll be no contact in 7 years, the first time she's away that suffocating presence she won't look back.", "NTA. It is unfair of them to create a situation and demand others cover for them.\nYou are the \u201ccool aunt\u201d. Amy is the mom. Of course at her age she will choose you given the choice.\nAmy and Hugo need to start listening to her. She\u2019s getting close to teen years. It\u2019s reasonable that she wants some space. Advocating for her is the thing you can do in her best interests.", "NTA. It sounds like you are really trying to help your niece by giving her an outlet to discuss her feelings. I might suggest that you try to convince your brother and his wife that they should all get into family therapy, because it sounds like they could all benefit.", "Lots of issues here.  Yes, you should not lie to Ashley about you wanting to cancel the trip, but you live overseas.  You see her a few times a year whereas Amy is her mother and has to be a parent and take care of Ashley year round.  Come to a middle ground.  Ask Hugo if you can take Ashley on the ski trip and talk to Ashley heart to heart.  It\u2019s OK to have a teenager want to discover themselves and have her own space, but to be feel embarrassed by her own mother and hurt her public by and doubling down is out of line.  At the end of the day, you all care for Ashley and want her to grow up to be a good person.", "NTA for refusing to lie to your niece.. She obviously needs someone she can trust because clearly she\u2019s feeling some big feelings, especially towards her mother & her father is going along with the mom because he already knows what could transpire if he does speak up for his daughter because Amy\u2019s behavior is manipulative - to attempt to have you lie to her- leaving room to potentially vilify you later. \n\nTo touch on another point, it is HARD not to fit in especially when a child is going to a school with the kid of parents you described. If Amy is having a hard time now with her daughter, she\u2019s definitely in for it as your niece becomes an actual teenager. It is normal to be embarrassed by your parents. Is Amy intentionally injecting herself into her daughters social life to be a part of it? Or is she being overbearing? Because if she wanted to be a part of it she\u2019d want to be dressed appropriately for these social outings particularly if she knows about her daughters social struggles. \n\nI would say you should tell her the truth & console her emotions & help her sort through them the best you can because it definitely sounds like you\u2019re gonna be the one she calls when her parents other lies come to light because there\u2019s little chance that there\u2019s not more to come or that don\u2019t already exist. Break her down on it appropriately. There will be other opportunities to take her out & she\u2019s going to need you later on.

By not going along with the plan - you are only going to alienate her from her mother and make her even more of a spoiled brat", "You are right, you should not lie to Ashley. If her parents have decided that this a consequence of Ashley actions, they have to explain their reasons and why.\n\nThe relationship between Ashley is quite complex. Ashley is behaving like her age, starting to develop her friendship and connections. Also, given the school situation and normal peer experience and pressure, this is making it harder. \n\nIn time, Ashley will recognise what her mum means to her when she get older, but if this continues it could put a permanent wedge between them which may not repair itself\n\n\nYes, Amy was young when they had her daughter which would be hard around 18-19yrs, so needed a friend and decided to make Ashley, rather than be her mum. \n\nI get the reason why Amy did it but it cant continue, kids grow up and that means parents need to step back, give them space to experience life with them supporting. I know that it\u2019s easy to say and extremely hard to do as it include a lose as they are starting to become teens, young adults and not young kids. Ashley is clear how she feels, how much her mum wants to be involved in life and it\u2019s too much for her. \n\nTo me, Amy is trying to hold on for dear life to daughter but she is hurting herself as well as Ashley. I think Amy need some support from family or therapist, to process her feelings/emotional and look at what she needs to maintain her relationship with Ashley and what her might be missing for herself. No parents are perfect, they are human. If Amy has put her own live into Ashley, she needs support to find herself and build another side to her life\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you should pull back, by giving Ashley someone to talk about her feelings allow her to be heard and you give her a different perspective - which is really important. You tried do the best, just keep communication with your brother and Amy and share what info that Ashley is willing to share unless you are concerned about her wellbeing.", "NTA - Amy needs to go get help/ learn tools from a psychologist on how to get along with her daughter - There is no shame in this, I myself went to a psychologist for other reasons but we also talked about parenting/communication which was really helpful as my eldest was in her teen years (she's 21yrs now) & I feel it made a world of difference. Perhaps talk to Hugo about this, so Amy doesn't feel it's an attack from you, which of course it isn't.", "NTA.

Amy is smothering her trying to be her whole social world and she is relying on Ashley being her entire social network. \n\nMaybe Amy needs to go make some actual friends of her own and leave her daughter and her friends alone.\n\nDo not lie to Ashley for Amy\u2019s and your brother\u2019s sake.

It was her role, she didn't want to because then she wouldn't be the cool aunt anymore.", "No, it sounds like a preteen is embarrassed by her mom like most teens are at that age and wants her cool aunt to impress her friends. \n\nI think the mom feels like she\u2019s loosing her connection to her daughter and jealous of the relationship she has with her aunt, especially when she tells her \nprefers her aunt.", "Yeah let's NOT assume. Her mom probably is exhausted but is trying her best!! From the story you can tell the Aunt is trying to play the rich cool aunt and Ashley is being taught that outside appearances and flashly displays is \"important\".

OP can try, but if they ultimately stand their ground, that should be respected as Ashley\u2019s parents. Even if it\u2019s not right.", "I'm wondering if Ashley has expressed her frustration with her mother before and her parents aren't listening. These are normal teenage/pre-teen feelings. Forcing her to miss out on something that was pre-planned is going to feel like a punishment to Ashley regardless of the parent's intent. Forcing her to spend time with her family and her mother is not going to improve their relationship when she's already feeling smothered and not heard. They are likely just going to alienate her more. OP certainly should not lie to cover for this as this just risks giving this poor girl no outlet for the frustration she is (legitimately) feeling. I think her being there with advice like this will only be a help during what I suspect are going to be some rough teen years ahead.", "Are you saying is normal a preteen is embarrassed her mother isn't wealthy? I understand feeling embarrassed for moms being clingy, or their actions, or just because, but for clothes brands or cars? That is just kid being disrespectful and a brat.", "It literally says they talked about it.", "You are assuming exactly as much with your point of  view as I am with mine.

It is not the child's responsibility to like hanging out with their parents and expecting them to at that age is fucking absurd.", "Yeah so after reading OPs edit, it does appear that Ashley is attending an expense school where clothes and brands are much more likely to determine your popularity and she needs to be taught that is unhealthy and making fun of how her mom dresses isn't acceptable. That said, Ashley is under no obligation to hang out with her mom and if Amy wants that she needs to work harder to relate to Ashley, but not by being a moron and taking away a ski trip and trying to lie about it.", "All OP should say to Ashley is \"I agree your behavior was unacceptable, and I'll respect whatever decision they make about your punishment. They're your parents so it's not my place to interfere.\" \n\nBut she shouldn't lie for them.", "Info. Why does Ashley not like you? As it stands NTA. I could understand your brother and his wife asking you to back them in the reasons for canceling the trip but it's wrong to lie.", "NTA. It's not right for them to tell you to lie. Ashley is 11 and can figure out the truth here.\n\nNot sure if you've addressed why Amy and you don't get along. Could there be some jealous around your lifestyle compared to hers (having children young, etc).", "Oof this is difficult. I don\u2019t think Ashley should be lied to. Your brother and Amy aren\u2019t addressing the actual problem here. Ashley is spoiled. That\u2019s their problem.

You aren\u2019t Ashley\u2019s parent so it\u2019s not your place to decide what\u2019s best for her. You\u2019re auntie. Not mom.

Your niece loves your sister, but sometimes people aren\u2019t compatible. Living together every day highlights even the smallest conflicts in personality. I love my mom so much, but living with her as a teen was a nightmare. Our relationship dramatically improved when I moved away. You can still love someone you aren\u2019t compatible with. \n\n2. Of course your niece is embarrassed by her mother. She\u2019s an 11 year old girl.

Meanwhile, she\u2019s trying way too hard to be her daughter\u2019s friend when clearly that\u2019s not going to work and it reinforces her daughter\u2019s distance. \n\nOnce again, don\u2019t listen to the Redditors on here that have never interacted with other humans.

I had aunts and uncles that were better off. My parents were just happy when I bonded with family. So what if they took me to something my parents regularly couldn't afford?

Don\u2019t lie to protect them because then you\u2019re helping them hurt their relationship with Ashley further by lying to her but maybe suggest ways you can think of for Amy and Ashley to bond.

Your neice looks up to you strongly. If you provide an example of a good and empathetic person she might just emulate you a bit more and learn compassion better. Just a thought. If it were me, I'd apologize to her mother and then tell Ashley that wasn't ok.

But if you want to help her relationship with not only you but her mom (there\u2019s space in her heart for both if Amy backs off and you don\u2019t try to fill that hole with money supplements), then you\u2019ve gotta bridge that gap with Amy. \n\nYou currently know her daughter better than she does. That\u2019s gotta be so painful for her. She\u2019s jealous of that bond and wanting to lash out. You don\u2019t have to be the bad guy tho.

She went so far as to sabotage relationships I had with other adults who were caring and kind like music and drama teachers, sports coaches, a lady I babysat for etc.\nDoes it help to understand she isn\u2019t willfully being nasty to her mom but trying desperately to breathe? Enmeshed parenting can be considered a type of abuse when it stunts a child\u2019s growth and development to cater to the parents emotional needs. \nAshley needs parents who put her needs first and get therapy to provide for their own emotional health.", "The mom is insecure and its affecting the daughter.", "Maybe she\u2019s trying to find independence (a normal 11 year old behavior) the only way she knows how?

The mom's behavior needs  some adjusting but the daughter is no peach.", "It seems like both things are happening. Amy is wrong to be smothering her kid and constantly inserting herself. Ashley is wrong for getting caught up in materialistic bullshit. While this behavior might be \u201cnormal\u201d for her school, that doesn\u2019t make it okay. No matter how perfectly she tries to fit in, she will probably be mocked or teased for at some point anyway (I\u2019m not excusing that behavior, simply saying that it\u2019s awfully exhausting to live your life trying to impress bullies). It would be better for her to learn that those things do not truly matter and try to find friends based on common interests who are just decent people.\n\nAs a person who grew up poor in an affluent area, there was no way for me to fit in when it came to clothing/shoes/bags/whatever. So I just had to be my own person and find friends who liked me for who I was. My mom also smothered me, and was embarrassing af. But I wouldn\u2019t be cruel to her about how she looked and had to mentally work through my own embarrassment over superficial things too.", "Yeah tbh I think the whole family caused this problem. The wealthy grandparents cut off funding making it where Amy had to stay home to take care of her then magically funding comes back to send the kid to a prestigious school where wealth is all there is to it, and surprise surprise the kid is now a brat who doesn't like her commoner mother because her dad's rich family is giving her attention. No way in hell they'd actually see this, but Amy and her husband should really look into this school because it seems like it's setting their daughter up for failure. Like it or not she's not wealthy having her in an environment like this in her formulative years could be encouraging her to engage in risky behaviour simply to match her peers. Especially since she's latched on to her aunt who shows up in a sports car for a photo opt and an expensive ski trip. The daughter seems to be picking up some very concerning behaviour.", "Enough with the pearl clutching, honestly.", "Why would I ask her that? That\u2019s for her parents to decide, not either of us. She has apologised but she won\u2019t speak to Amy beyond good morning and answering questions.", "That seems like a wild leap.  Sure sometimes people lose jobs but I doubt most think, \"oh this happened because I said something that hurt my mom's feelings as a teenager.\" \n\nIt's highly unlikely that your kid will go through their entire life never hurting your feelings, if so, consider yourself truly lucky.  My stepkid is still very young and has already said hurtful things to me and my husband.  We try to let it roll off our backs because the kid is just being a kid.  We still love the kiddo and I think we both understand that there are certain actions we can take that will help us bond with the kiddo and certain actions we could take that would be counterproductive to bonding with the kiddo.  \n\nWhat Amy and Hugo are doing is HUGELY counterproductive.", "You seem to be projecting some personal issues here.

It's too bad Amy can't bridge a relationship with you and see you as the Ally you are.", "LMAO, yeah, you're really showing your kindness around here with the way talking about an 11 year old girl.", "Yeah i don't see a single comment about sweatpants?", "I don\u2019t like that Amy likes me more than her mum, that\u2019s childish. I like spending time with her, yes, but I\u2019m not her parent, I don\u2019t have the tools to be a parent, and I don\u2019t want to be yet. \n\nI don\u2019t have a tense relationship with Amy, we are perfectly civil.\n\nHer parents define the consequences to their daughter\u2019s behaviour, not me.", "Do we know that for a fact? Looking like a \"slob\" could mean that she's showing up in Levi jeans and a tank top. If every other mom is showing up with Rolexes and Balenciaga sunglasses, the daughter's gage for what \"slovenly\" is might be off.", "Inviting a niece or nephew to a cool trip is simply that.  Not an attempt to \"exclude\" anyone.  OP made it clear that Amy doesn't like her, so why on earth would she extend the invitation to someone like that?  \n\nWould you invite someone on a trip who didn't like you?\n\nWhen I was a teenager I was allowed to invite a friend to our beach vacation.  It was an invite to my friend NOT her parents as well.  They weren't \"excluded\" but they weren't friends with my parents so it didn't make sense to invite them too.  All they had to do was give permission for my friend to come, and they did.  They gave their daughter a great experience in the process.  We had a great time. \n\nI really don't follow your line of thinking at all.", "The parents are not an innocent party here. Especially the mom.", "That\u2019s fine just make sure you tell her why she\u2019s not going.  She needs to know that her actions are not okay.  Whether the aunt tells her or her parents tell her, a stealth punishment is not going to send that message.", "I tell her when I think she\u2019s wrong, and we talk about it if we have a difference of opinion. For me that\u2019s where it ends, once she knows where and why I stand on an issue, I don\u2019t think I should try and make her agree with me. And that has nothing to do with being cool, I\u2019m like that with every single person in my life. \n\nAs it happens, Ashley agrees she was wrong to say what did to her mother.", "I don\u2019t think you should lie about going on the trip. You could maybe say that you all decided it would be best for her family to spend time together, and then she can be mad at you, too, and not just her mom. That would be the appropriate \u201cfall on your own sword\u201d lie because at least it can\u2019t come back to Ashley that you lied about going on the trip at all (which is inevitable). I\u2019m not saying that is the best idea in what has become a shitty situation, but it is a compromise that at least won\u2019t totally ruin your relationship with Ashley even if she is mad at you for a bit. She\u2019ll be a lot more mad if you tel her you aren\u2019t going and then go without her!", "I kind of understand OP's perspective, only because when I was age 10-14 I had a friend who's mom was absolutely suffocating. Her mom wanted to be her best friend, always involving herself in her social life and not letting her daughter build her own relationships with people her own age. She was a really nice lady, just not ready to let her kid start preparing to leave the nest. \n\nThe result was that my friend started pushing her away the only way she knew how, by being mean. All she really wanted was some autonomy, privacy and personal space. But unfortunately asking nicely wasn't getting the job done.\n\nI see a lot of similarities between OPs post and my childhood friend's situation. I kind of get it.", "Because op didn\u2019t make the choice to leave her niece home", "But OP already stated her bil/sil do not want niece to not go because it's a punishment. This would directly go against what her bil/sil want and likely cause more issues", "Not OPs job to parent", "So punish her twice for one incident? She\u2019s already had the ice skating taken away as a direct consequence of her being rude to her mother", "The way OP words things definitely gives me some kind of vibe regarding how she feels about Amy.\n\nLike, instead of just saying \u201cmy brother and his wife have two kids\u201d she had to make it super clear that her brother \u201cgot his girlfriend pregnant\u201d and that\u2019s the only reason she\u2019s still around. Then the whole parents disowning him thing, which OP is seemingly accepting as normal and okay\u2026 I can see why Amy might be feeling uncomfortable in this family. I can see why she\u2019d worry about in-laws encouraging her child in her rude behavior.", "I think it depends. Ashley told her mom she thinks she's uncool because of how she dresses, but she told her aunt it's because her mom tries to insert herself into her social circle and act like a friend instead of a mom. And the second reason is completely valid. She could be getting social pushback from her friends, or she could just feel uncomfortable and not supported like she should be as a child with a parent.\n\nI think OP should talk to her brother about this, because Ashley isn't old enough to navigate how she's feeling and communicate it to her mother on her own. And her mom's decision to double-down so they can become closer is gonna fail.\n\nIf Ashley was just annoyed because her mom wasn't affluent, I'd agree with you 100%, but I don't think that's all that's going on here. But I do agree OP shouldn't be letting the actual behavior go without comment. Even just saying \"hey, that's an uncool thing to say,\" can be effective.", "In regards to Ashley though, it may not necessarily be that she\u2019s looking down at her mom. If Amy really is suffocating her, I can kind of understand why she\u2019s acting the way she is. Not giving Ashley a pass by any means, but i can see where she\u2019s coming from. It isn\u2019t right to make OP fall on her sword or whatever so Amy can continue to force a bond as a friend instead of a parent. If they want to cancel the ski trip for Ashley, they should be the ones to tell her. If Amy wants to spend time with Ashley, she needs to do something for Ashley, instead of making it about herself.", "Why should she have to act like she doesn't want her to come? This is the parents job because the parents are the ones who don't want to go! It is not OPs job to fix Amy's and Ashleys relationship that's on mom and mom needs to figure it out! OP isn't undermining her they asked the parents they said yes now that they've recanted they need to tell the daughter they did and WHY. However, op could tell them they should punish her for her behavior. It is not OPs job to dish out punishments for bad behavior that is her parents job! So what? Every time Ashley acts up they get someone else to take the blame? Parenting means doing the hard stuff too not push it off on other family", "Why? It\u2019s bad advice. Let the parents be the ones to decide punishments and also be responsible for communicating the punishments.", "This is the kind of relationship my wife and I are shooting for with our kids. Three daughters and two sons, oldest is 11 so still have a while until we know if we did ok.", "My son 100% does not see me as a friend, and same, I don't want him to. I want him to see me as someone who he can come to, as someone who will know what to do of shit happenes he can't handle. It never bothered me as a kid eother when my mom would say it, I would roll my eyes and what not, but damn did I surprose myself when I said it to him.", "Well I'm not her parent now, am I?", "OP mentions brother was cutoff by their parents after knocking up Amy, and Amy raised Ashely alone those first years without even BIL's support really. \n\nOP was still a minor at the time and likely cutoff from SIL/BIL too. \n\nAmy could be resentful of the entire family over this.", "It\u2019s not just a ski trip.  Did everyone skip the part at the top where mentions the sports car, horse back riding, shows, shopping? And did everyone miss the fact it\u2019s a two week ski trip?  Do you know how much a two week ski trip costs?\n\nAnd actually, all of a sudden Ashley goes to a private school and hates Amy because of that - but when OP picked her up at school the classmates were impressed with a sports car?  The lack of brand here makes me realize this is fake now that I think about it and you all fell for it.", "Thanks for replying with more info. I was making an assumption without all the info, sorry about that. I agree that treating children with respect like this is important.", "how can you say 'don't lie' and then in the next line tell OP to lie?  \"you ALL\" didn't decide that \"it would be best for her family to spend time together\".  Her parents decided (as is their right) and told OP that Ashley couldn't go.  I don't see where OP would be obligated to take *any* responsibility for the niece losing out on a ski trip just because mommy wants to bond (and the ski trip dates are the *only* dates that this bonding can happen, evidently)\n\nOP is NTA.  But her Bro and SIL are for asking her to lie to their kid.", "True and I'd understand the post from Ashley's perspective, but OP doesn't seem to understand she's taken on a mentor role to her. Her ignoring her mother, the grandparents punishing them for being stupid while young, the school prioritizing wealth, it just seems like the ripe environment where Ashley could be picking up nasty habits and whereas rn she doesn't mean it, give it a few years with no correctional direction then that could change. OP is trying to be her friend, but is also in a position to undermind her brother and sil to their child.", "I am not so sure. It seems niece doesn't like her mom chaperoning because she doesn't dress like the other moms or have flashy purses or cars. That is being mean ad a superficial brat.", "Fair, but if she's already arguing with brother and sil then why not volunteer to retract the offer herself to help her brother and his wife save face. It's possible the statement was made because they figured OP wouldn't want to do that. Personally rn I don't think she should be talking to Ashley and strictly communicate to the parents only until this situation is resolved", "I'm an uncle, and while I see it as part of my role to allow the kids more when with me and be cool and crazy and what not, it was always reasonable.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'll return the kids and the parents have to deal with the more serious consequences. And that's the boundary as uncle/aunt. Don't try to be the favorite at the expense of their relationship with the parents.\n\nSometimes it also means to step up for the parents.", "It's not her job to parent, but if she wants the niece she loves to grow up to be a well adjusted adult instead of a dick, she'll use teaching opportunities with her when appropriate.", "Relax, the kid has already admitted she knew she was wrong.", "Actions should have consequences... that kid is being disrespectful and money oriented. You don't need to be her mom to express disappointment about such attitude.", "But Ashley shouldn't be shared her mother for dressing \"worse\" than her friend's mom. What Ashley is doing, even If is just for make her mother don't want to spend time with her needs to stop because it's a horrible behavior.", "Sometime you have to do what is best for everyone, even if you don't like someone involved. Parenting is hard, I was a difficult as hell teenager and I had cool adults in my life that I wanted to hang out with way more than my mom at that time. But publically embarrassing her was not acceptable behavior and OP needs to acknowledge that too.", "If it makes you hopeful, my mom and I - despite not being \u201cfriends\u201d to me - are so close that my grandma feels we are too close in that if one \u201cgoes\u201d the other will go too (a La Carrie fisher and Debbie reynolds). Very morbid, im sorry, but my grandma legit told my mom that after their passing. But nah I love my mom even though she gets on my nerves. Nobody rides for me like she does even at my big age \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79", "Oh, right. It's okay for you to be a mean girl (towards pre-teens), but when anyone else does it, they're wrong. Makes sense.", "From OP\u2019s update she doesn\u2019t sound like a normal good mom. She tried to hard to be her daughter\u2019s friend and her daughter feels suffocated by her because she won\u2019t give her the space to have her own friends. She sounds like a bad mom. \n\nAnd aunts are supposed to spoil kids.", "It's possible Amy doesn't know healthy conflict resolution techniques. If you just want to lay down the law but can't have a mature conversation that allows all parties to be heard, that's nigh impossible for a pre-teen just discovering her independence to submit to. You can't force friendship, but giving room for mutual respect goes a long way towards a more civil relationship in general.", "You\u2019ve heard of peer pressure, right? Wanting to fit in, not be made fun of, all that good stuff.", "Yeah this isn't normal preteen shit, this is \"my parents are poor and I hate them for it\" shit.\n\nI'd transfer her to public school.", "Because if OP retracts the offer over kid's behavior, it's still a punishment and still against bil/sil's wants.", "Yeah, because constant punishment and shaming really works when raising children.", "Which is why I said talk to them. Point out, \"Hey I know you want to do this, but I don't think it'll end the way you want to. What about if we do this instead for the situation?\" She may not be the kid's parent, but she is involved in the situation and everyone needs to be on the same page. Once the situation is resolved OP may need to back off a bit so Amy and Ashley's relationship can heal without her presence in the background."]}
