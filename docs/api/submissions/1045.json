Which is gross, but it also means that the \u201cin bed\u201d part isn\u2019t the treat, it\u2019s just the making breakfast part.

Sometimes an item gets missed or I'm unaware of a preference of theirs. When they ask about whatever it is, I do the best I can to resolve it so they will enjoy the meal. I do this because they're my partner and I like them and I want them to be happy. This seems normal to me, and my partner does the same.

Not unless the jam was for her benefit, which it sounded like it was mostly a request by the boyfriend for the boyfriend. If instead she wanted the jam and wanted him to get it for her, then that's a transaction. Doesn't make sense to say she's trading in her effort to do everything else for breakfast to get in return.... him getting his own jam for his own toast. That's not her actually receiving anything in exchange for doing everything else.", "That isn\u2019t a transaction or how it went according to OP.", "i assume at n point in your relation you have asked hi to get you say like a glass of water or something, because you would probably be the first girlfriend in history to do this", "He also could have just gotten it.

Then, he might be jamless. Otherwise, of course I\u2019d go get it. I don\u2019t understand refusing that on principle at all.", "Like it's fine for him to ask. But it's also fine for her to say no.", "She was still doing him a nice thing by making him breakfast and then suddenly decided she'd done enough and didn't want to be nice anymore.

Sometimes one person does more. Boyfriend isn\u2019t lazy for asking op for jam. Op is lame af for making this a bigger deal than it needs to be. As stated in a previous comment, you should be able to ask your partner for things without fear of a fight or some kind of transaction. It\u2019s fucking jam. If op was committed to bringing bf breakfast in bed, just get him the jam. Be nice to your partner because *they\u2019re your partner and you love them*", "I kinda agree that OP is making this transactional. OP didn\u2019t necessarily make breakfast to create an IOU scenario, but when the BF asked for jam, her response was basically, \u201cI did something, now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d", ">and she refused to get it so he would then have to get out of bed after she made a point of bringing him breakfast in bed.\n\nThis. Right. Here. \n\nShe makes a point of saying he was tired so she fixed breakfast but is then surprised when he asks her to grab something? I would be pissed if someone did that to me right after I woke up and was groggy. She also says they live with other people so maybe he wasn't awake enough to put on clothes and interact with other people yet? \n\nI will admit I'm biased because I've been in situations where people weaponize kind gestures (like holding them over your head as if you now owe them for something you didn't ask for or even want) so her \"I did everything else!\" just hits me weird. Like, he didn't ask her to fix breakfast, she chose to.\n\n\nIf the purpose of the gesture was \"be kind to sleepy person\" then...don't make them get up?", "based reddit user", "She already brought everything else and it's not like he doesn't like butter or he only eats it with jam, she already did everything, if he wanted more he could have just done it himself , nothing wrong with him asking and nothing wrong with her saying no but his reaction wasnt it", "Exactly", "She does note that part of the reason she did it is because he was very sleepy and hungry. So there does seem to have been some intention there associated with the bed.", "Eh, I do see where you're coming from, but we're just gonna have to agree to disagree. I've already explained why I think OP is also to blame for this situation, so I'm not gonna rehash most of it here. \n\nI will add, though, that IMO if you're doing something nice for someone like bringing them breakfast in bed, it kinda defeats the purpose (which is, primarily, them not having to get up for breakfast) to then refuse to go grab one more thing for them. It's not like he was asking OP to go make him an extra omelet or something. It would've taken exactly 30 seconds for OP to just go grab the stupid jam, and they were already up, unlike the bf. Of course it's also rude af to demand that they go get something extra for you and refuse to just eat the dang toast without it, so...

She didn't need to get up *again* to get jam when him getting up would take the same amount of effort, especially after she already made the whole meal for them *and* brought it to him.\n\nHonestly he's being churlish and ungrateful. Her only 'wrong' is that she didn't go even *more* above and beyond than she already had. That doesn't make her an asshole.", "Yes, of course, obviously since her intention was to be nice she's obligated to make sure he has everything he wants no matter what", "The benefit to her was that she didn\u2019t have to get the jam\u2026 Her boyfriend isn\u2019t the greatest here either, though", "He doesnt regularly use jam though, he switches between butter, jam and both, she gave him butter which is something hes shown hes fine with", "I favour an ESH ruling on this one, personally. He was definitely being childish and petty about the toast but I think she was too. She brought him breakfast because he was sleepy - that\u2019s what she said. Why would you draw the line at jam? If I bring my partner food I cooked and he asks for the salt I go get it because Im already up and puttering and I want him to enjoy his food. He does the same for me. That seems like normal relationship behaviour to me.", "It\u2019s jam for toast. It\u2019s not \u201ceverything no matter what.\u201d Obviously there\u2019s an upper limit. Jam falls below that.", "But she didn\u2019t want or need the jam, so it isn\u2019t a benefit for her. Her not having to do him a favor isn\u2019t really a benefit for her. \n\nI agree though, the bf isn\u2019t the greatest. Such a tiny issue lol.", "The line is drawn because shed need to get up from her own meal to grab the jam, and at that point the energy to that would be equal for both of them. She already got up on her own and made and delivered the entire meal.", "Was that in a comment? I don\u2019t see where it says that she had to get up for it. That would change things for me - once I\u2019m sat down, I\u2019m way less likely to get up frivolously."]}
