Time for some self-reflection.\n\nTransactional, for sure.  I can't imagine what you except for or after se#", "I'm going with ESH.  You for arguing and dying on the hill, him for doing the arguing as well, but did he have his morning ya know thing (don't know what I can call it on reddit) and didn't want to be in close proximity to your brother? And if he was sleepy you could just leave the food out in the kitchen for when he woke up.", "ESH.   You both sound like insufferable petulant children.", "My husband is so good to me, I would have gotten him his jam! \nPick your battles, life is too short to argue over the small stuff. \nDon\u2019t take each other for granted.", "Not the AH\u2026you did a nice thing for him by cooking breakfast. Him hopping up and grabbing some jam shouldn\u2019t have been an issue.", "YTA\n\nHonestly if you chose to bring him this meal purely from a loving place, getting jam when he wanted it was an easy thing to do for the love of him. If you brought this to him in bed as a kind or loving gesture, expecting him to get out of bed and go get anything after that point completely invalidated any gesture you meant to make.", "I n f o\n\nYour boyfriend has legs right?\n\nNTA. Youre not a waitress, you did the nice thing by preparing it all and bringing it. If he wants anything he can get off his butt and get it and let you have your turn to sit in bed like he had", "YTA. Why couldn\u2019t you get the jam? Isn\u2019t the point of making the breakfast in bed so the person doesn\u2019t have to get out of bed? This is a really stupid argument that could\u2019ve been avoided if you just got the jam. He was well within his rights to ask for jam. If my boyfriend asked for jam I would say \u201cof course!\u201d And grab it immediately. You\u2019re weird.", "YTA for wasting toast.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you just eat his toast?!", "It sounds exactly like he said - you\u2019re probably generally transactional like this.

This was a power play.     \nEither of you could have gotten the jam but three sentences in it's now a pissing contest to see who's going to give in first.  \nWhat's more important?  Making sure everyone understands that you take orders from no one or being a decent human and helping someone when they ask for it?  \nOn the other side, once you decided that you'd been nice enough for one morning, he could have just said \"Okay, I'll get it myself.\"  \nIt can be just as simple as being a decent human if you let it.", "It's a small apartment. He's obviously still in bed.  OP has been up and about, he asks for jam for his toast.  Is it so hard to forgo a bit of convenience for your partner?  It's not like he asked her to go to the store or made an unreasonable request.Get the jam, and have a lovely day.  It wasn't worth having a fight about. TA.", "NTA. \n\nIf it were me, I would\u2019ve gotten the jam.  You decided to cook breakfast and bring it to him in bed; he didn\u2019t ask you to do that.  He thanked you for the gesture, and asked for jam.  I don\u2019t think that was such an unreasonable request.  \n\nHowever, once you said that he should get his own jam, he should have just sucked it up and gotten it if he really wanted it.  He especially shouldn\u2019t have acted like a child and refused to eat his toast because you didn\u2019t get him jam.  \n\nIf his reaction is an indication of how he usually acts, then I understand better why you were annoyed about him asking for jam.  If my bf acted that petty and childish, I would want him to get his own jam too.", "Yta and sound like hard work just get the jam. That he says you make things transactional is concerning. It\u2019s so hard dating someone like that", "esh. thanks for making me appreciate that i have a loving relationship. \n\n\"brought you breakfast!\"\n\"thanks! is there jam here?\"\n\"no, lemme go get it!\"\n\"no its ok, you already did enough\"\n\"you sure? i don't mind\"\n\"of course\"\n\"nah it's ok, imma got it out real fast\"\n\nis how we'd go.", "All OP\u2019s responses sound really defensive, which resonates with me thinking YTA.", "ESH this is so damn petty it\u2019s not even funny.", "NTA. He can get his own jam. You are not his mommy. He tried to take something nice you did for him and turn it into you being a jerk because you didn't do even more. Unless he has two broken legs, he can get up and get it if he wants it.", "ESH. You're in a relationship, you should be free to ask things of each other, and willing to do nice things and help each other out. Earlier today I was on the couch and found a splinter type of thing in my blanket. I asked my husband (who was playing a game) to bring me tweezers. Without questiong or getting mad, he got up and brought me tweezers. I then asked him to put my phone to charge, and again he did. Because he's nice and loves me. Likewise I bring him food and drinks, and will do stuff for him if he asks. And if for some reason we don't, we don't argue about it, because there's probably a good reason and we love each other more than the issue.\n\nYou two need to step up in the way you show love for each other throughout the day, because refusing to do a benign request and arguing is not conducive to a loving relationship", "NTA, he could of gotten his own jam. You did everything else.", "LMAO fuck him and his toast. You need to bounce", "I\u2019ll probably get downvoted if anyone even reads this,  but you can tell who has and hasn\u2019t been in a healthy relationship based on the comments.", "NTA", "I wish this kind of problems \ud83d\ude2d", "ESH. His comment at the end about throwing the toast out was uncalled for, but you're also TA for acting like asking for jam was a big ask. The fact that y'all eat meals in bed doesn't matter. When I make a meal for my partner and myself, I call to him when it's done so he can come make his own plate. You didn't call to your boyfriend. You brought him his meal. I imagine he thought that if you were willing to do that, you would be okay with grabbing the jam for him when he noticed there wasn't any. Y'all are young, but that's what y'all do for those you care about. \"Here, I brought you your breakfast so you could relax, do you need anything else before I sit down?\" My partner and I have been doing that for each other since we were y'all's age. 12 years later and we still do it.", "YTA - you\u2019re being hot and then cold. You chose to make him the breakfast but then got \u2018annoyed\u2019 because he asked for some jam? That was downright childish.

You for just getting the goddamn jam and him if he was not a lazy bum. What a selfless relationship /s", "I feel like ESH. \n\nOn one hand, I feel like it wouldn't have been difficult to just go back and get him some jam for his toast. Even if he doesn't always put jam on his toast. I get things for my spouse all the time that they ask me to grab for them from downstairs, the other room, etc. I did that for them even before we married.\n\nHowever, I also have the right to say no, please go grab it yourself. You should have that right as well, and he should never have tried to be petty and make a point later on by going \"sure throw it away since you won't get me jam\". He was definitely acting like a child there, for sure.", "NTA. You got up and made breakfast for him, he then acted like a spoilt brat. His legs work right? Plus who eats jam on toast with eggs?  If you stay together, Good luck on Fathers Day - when he has to choke down burnt toast his kids are so proud of, I guess he\u2019ll critique that too, right?", "ESH Since it's a small place, either one could have gotten the jam.", "NTA - You made breakfast for yourself because you were hungry, and you made some for him, too.  You even brought it to him.  If he wanted something besides the eggs, toast, and coffee, he was more than welcome to go get it for himself.    \n\n\nYour edit adds that you eat all meals in your bed, so this was not a special occasion breakfast delivery.  Just like in any occasion he might want an addition to his meal, he can go get it!", "ESH... Was it really that big a deal to grab the jam? Not really. When I am the one to prepare a meal, I do all of those server functions as well, oh the salt? Let me.grab that for you. Etc. You already stated you knew he was tired and you wanted what you wanted so you took it upon yourself to serve up the meal, just go ahead and finish what you started.\n\nBut the boyfriend was no better. Initially asking for the jelly, fine. But that passive aggressive BS of I don't want the toast if you aren't getting me the jelly... Well, I already told you I wasn't, so I guess you don't want toast. End of story.\n\nSo, you weren't the A H for throwing out the roast at the end, but you were for the actions that set the whole thing in motion.", "NTA. Maybe the original argument was petty between the both of you but if he said toss it and you did, then that\u2019s on him. He ought to just appreciate the amount you did. Could you have brought jam? Yes. Maybe you had already sat down.", "I just want to say I really like this comment. Very wholesome and I hope OP sees it.", "Bruh lmao what? It\u2019s a nice gesture and he has two functioning legs that can use to get a freaking jar lmao", "I am not sure the edit is true or not, but this sounds like my house rn. We have an 800 sq ft house. We have no room for a table. We switch between eating in the loving room and having a family movie night in our bedroom for dinner. For breakfast and lunch kiddo has a small table for one in the kitchen that folds up. If someone was also living in my living room, most meals would be in our bed. \n\nThis definitely doesn't sound like the traditional 'breakfast in bed' most think of. It sounds like all their meals are eaten in their bedroom. Think of it as serving at the table. If it was me, I know my husband likes butter but no jam, so I make his toast that way. However he likes his biscuits with jam, so I serve them that way. He also know how I like my toast (no biscuits for me \ud83e\udd23 ) \n\nWhole situation seems to be about more than the jam to me.", "My basis on this; my husband wakes up earlier than me and thus likes to cook breakfast some weekend mornings. He knows I am not a morning person, even though he is.  But if he brought me some toast when I was barely awake, he would bring me literally anything I asked for. I usually wouldn't because that's my own hang-up. But he would do it for me because we both know, bringing me breakfast was something he decided to do for me. And similarly, when I bring him night-time snacks or get him extra stuff with the groceries, that is just stuff we do for eachother.\n\n\nUltimately, love each other and have some communication on this", "I get what you\u2019re saying and it seems logical on the surface, but it doesn\u2019t really capture the idea of doing a favor for your significant other.  The whole point is you\u2019re letting them stay in bed because they are tired and don\u2019t want to get out of bed.  Now you\u2019re forcing him to get out of bed at a time he really didn\u2019t want to.  Just complete the favor.  You\u2019re doing something to make them happy. It shouldn\u2019t be about the fact that you\u2019ve already done something for them therefore you don\u2019t have to do anything else.\n\nAnd dry toast .. cmon now", "It's not transactional to say 'no' to a request for a favor, it's transactional to say 'if' to one.", "You wrote here to ask for judgment and yet you keep arguing and then adding lol/lmao. You\u2019re a very young 20.", "Sure but past a certain point it's not worth arguing over. At least _one_ of them should be able to go get the jam and get over it. It's stupid that he didn't but it's also stupid that she didn't.", "She was already in the kitchen after he was basically done eating why not just get him jam?", "Bring breakfast to bed, bring breakfast to the table, it really does not matter, if you know I like jam on the toast bring the jam.....\n\nMy wife likes hot sauce on her eggs, does not matter where I serve her, in the kitchen or on the couch, or in bed, if I bring eggs I bring the hot sauce. Is it that difficult to do something for the one you love?", ">NTA. They eat all their meals in bed, because she lives with her brother, and it's a small apt, and she has no dining room table.\n\nThis makes OP an even bigger asshole. So they have to eat in bed because she also has a relative squatting in their living room.", "They don't have a table to eat at. They eat all meals sitting on the bed.", "That's why, to me, this situation seems to be way more than the jam.", "But she still made him the food. She could have made herself a plate of food and let him get his own breakfast whenever he was less sleepy.", "Yeah which makes OP an even bigger asshole for having a relative squatting in the living room.", "If I surprise my wife with French fries I best have ketchup as well.  It doesn\u2019t matter that I already did something nice.  If she asks for ketchup too I\u2019m getting it.  I was doing it to do her a favor so I\u2019m going to complete the favor.  It\u2019s not a big ask.  Now if she asked me for ketchup and I straight up said no cuz I already got her fries that would come off very weird", "It sounds to me like OP was hungry and whatever was extra, became \u201cbreakfast in bed\u201d.  \n\n Wouldn\u2019t get the jam but took the plates back to the kitchen?  You showed up at the bedside with some food and a chip on your shoulder.   I feel bad for this dude.  YTA", "I think you're arguing against a point I am not making. People were saying it was a super special meal so she needed to get up and get him jam along with making his food. I am just saying that it was an everyday kindness that she did for him, and he was asking for more and being ungrateful.", "I agree with you. She didn\u2019t have to get him jam but his comment was unkind and she\u2019s NTA", "I think you're right that it not being a special occasion is a big consideration here. It wasn't like it was his birthday and she was making a big fuss of it, in which case yeah you wouldn't ask the person to get it for themselves. But it sounds to me like the vibe was much more that she was up earlier and hungry, and she went to the kindness of letting him sleep in and making some extra food for him instead of just cooking for herself. In this scenario he comes across as ungrateful and demanding. I'd tell him to get his own jam too.", "You do not put emphasis on something if it's not something in the realm that you do all the time normally. \n\nYes, they eat in bed all the time because of their situation but that does not mean she cooks all the time, which she puts emphasis on and he could be the one that almost always cooks. \n\nShe was being nice because he was in bed still and very tired. She made it a point to stress that she decided to cook because he was so tired. That usually means it's not something she normally does. \n\nHe was still in bed and she was up and moving It's easier for her to go back to the kitchen really quickly to grab something than it would have been for the person still in bed to have to do. \n\nThat would be like if the bf was out of bed and she decided she wanted a drink or something and she asked him to do it. It would be easier for him to go and do that than it would have been for her to get out of bed and do it so why would he be mad at her for asking him?", "I think we just disagree on this one."]}
