She can literally accomplish anything. Her first semester at college, she's done great, academically. I've told her since she was little that she was going to find a better way to treat cancer or make a better tasting bacon, or something in between those two. She's awesome.\n\nShe is, however, very introverted, which is fine. Being a couple hours away at school has been hard for her. She doesn't make friends easily, so she's felt very isolated. She came home a few times, very upset about the loneliness and challenges. \n\nOne of the times, we tried to come up with solutions, and I suggested that she transfer to the state university right near us, and get an apartment with her best friend that is still in the area. She could get an apartment, which we would chip in the majority of her portion for, seeing as we're not paying the room and board costs. She was all about it, but her best friend said she couldn't do it financially. Then I suggested her cousin, Desi. Desi is awesome. Love Desi.\n\nThen, though, she reaches out to her other cousin, Amanda. I don't care for Amanda as much. She's trouble. Since she was little, Amanda has been heavily involved in bullying. She was awful to her younger brother, she got hauled in for cyber-bullying classmates, and was vicious. She always gets away with it, somehow.\n\nWhen we had first relocated back to the area I am originally from, my daughter struggled. She left her friends group (this was in middle school), but her consolation was that she would be at the same school with Amanda. Amanda, however, instantly made her a pariah, for no reason, and she had no friends for months. We had to get her in therapy over it, and get her on medications. I watched her go from a happy wildflower to someone terrified of the world around her, and it was made worse by the perpetrator being the person we told her she could trust. Amanda was awful through high school. Amanda causes trouble constantly, and then rats out everyone else to save her own skin. It's a constant pattern. School vandalism, underage drinking, fights, all of it. She's a master manipulator.\n\nBut now, my daughter has spoken to Amanda, and said she's going to be in the apartment, too. I want to tell her absolutely not. I know Amanda will flake out, or she'll be a slob, or she'll invite drama and distract my daughter and Desi from their studies and absolutely ruin what should be a great experience for them.\n\nWIBTA if I refuse to allow her to get an apartment with Amanda, or make her pay for her portion if she does it anyways?", "created_utc": 1701890945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cbyvr/wibta_if_i_forbid_my_daughter_to_get_an_apartment/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to sit down and have a very frank discussion with your daughter about 1) why she's entertaining this, 2) why you are so concerned, 3) her current mental health status and 4) finances (because that's just smart at any point). In the end I wouldn't withhold the monetary help, because your daughter will need you as a lifeline if/when this all goes south.

Would you say the same if the  daughter wanted the money for drugs?

And I'm not being dramatic here. Have you ever sat down, and seriously and unironically told her \"We're sorry for ruining your life\"?. Because she deserves to hear those words. She deserves to hear that her socialization issues were your fault, not hers.\n\nBecause you better have had a *damn* good reason for moving back to your hometown and then staying there even after what that did to your daughter. Like, did you not know that Amanda was a troublemaker when you decided that that would be sufficient 'consolation' for losing all her friends? And did you not consider that maybe the move was a mistake to be undone, when she went from wildflower to wallflower?\n\nHas the transfer already gone through? Because you're making the same mistake *again*, by convincing her that the solution is for her to move home. The problem is trauma both from losing all her friends and from being bullied; and long-term, her moving closer to home isn't really a solution, it's just going to reinforce the idea that she isn't capable of making and keeping friends on her own without the help of family. She needs more therapy, and copious apologies from her parents.", "I'm confused, she is introverted and lonely.  The first doesn't need to be fixed, the second does.  Starting over at a new school as a transfer student is hard.  Not living on campus and having easy access to the social scene is hard.  Are her cousins going to cure her loneliness or are they going to have their own social lives that aren't conducive to an introvert?  Does she have a group of friends at the new school that she can pal around with?  Is Desi also in school and does she have time to pal around with your daughter?\n\nIt just isn't clear to me how changing schools and sharing an apartment is going to change things.  I assume she has roommates or can get them at her current school.

Now I'm going to have to jump to $1400 or so,because it wss my daughter's idea to invite Amanda in and I can't screw over Desi. I don't have that money. I can't do it.

Doesn't make sense.", "Being strong and independent has nothing to do with whether you're an introvert or an extrovert. As an introvert let me give you some advice: forcing her into situations to make her socialize more (i.e., joining a club and the road trips) may actually do more harm than good. Instead of making friends during these activities, she may actually be uncomfortable and feel more isolated. It's much worse to feel like you're apart & not feeling part of something in a crowd of people than it is to be apart on your own (by you own volition). It's one thing to encourage her to try to go to activities/clubs, it's a whole other thing to *require* it which could reinforce any insecurities/feelings she doesn't belong or fit in. Introverts find our way in our own time, it sometimes just takes a while to find people who \"get\" us and respect that we don't always want to be on the go or going out a lot", "Coming from the perspective of a very introverted woman who had alot of difficulty socialising in high school and through university, I find the above incredibly uncomfortable and controlling.\n\nYou cannot \"brute force\" your daughter into becoming more social and outgoing. If my parents had done this to me, I would've been so resentful and angry at them. And the fact that you're tying monetary support to it, makes it even worse. \n\nI'm not against you encouraging your daughter to be more social and even suggesting activities for her to go to. But making financial support conditional on this? Just gives me such a \"ick\" feeling. \n\nAt some point your daughter is going to have to learn on her own how to make friends and be more social. Will it be difficult? YES. But that's the nature of being an adult.", "So you'd be springing the new restriction on her. Well I'd just let her know how you feel and maybe restrict your support to one semester or one year. \n\nWould she still transfer if she lived alone? Is it possible on her end she's only transferring to have a roomie she's familiar with?\n\nI think NTA because I understand your perspective. You don't want to be subsidizing a bigger problem that will cause more problems and cost more money (breaking a lease at the very least). \n\nThis isn't unlike a scholarship that has various stipulations. Adulting is like that. Your daughter does need to learn about being careful about the company you keep and understanding there can be serious ramifications. Further, being grown and independent, making your own decisions also means paying all of your own bills. \n\nIt's great you're investing in her happiness. Best of luck.", "How will she afford all of this?  Wouldn\u2019t she make fiends at her job?", "#1 and #3 are overreaching.

I had a lease like that when I was about 22; I ended up  having to leave for a new job, but each of us was responsible for sending our part of the rent to the landlord directly, so it didn't fall on my roommates to pick up my end.\n\nI'm also introverted, and while I found my niche pretty quickly in college, making friends at that age was hard for me, too. I hope your daughter is still getting mental health care.", "Explaining this in the context of what you can afford seems perfectly reasonable. It is a red flag to me that your starting point was all about the backstory for your desire to control your adult daughter.", "I think part of your daughter's \"desperation\" surrounding being around people is from the way you are pushing her to be social.", "You can not finance it then but you dont get to tell your daughter who she can and cant live with.", "If her choice affects how much or if you\u2019re willing to give her, yeah. Really, her roommate flaking could happen with anyone. If you can\u2019t afford the whole rent in the event that were to happen, and there is no other option for your kid to make up the difference herself or find a new roommate, then maybe you should just offer her enough for a solo studio apartment, or a room in a house where she\u2019s can\u2019t be responsible for the whole thing.", "Okay and? No what's unreasonable is controlling who ur adult kid lives with.  \n\nI would let my child make their own choices  just cause I don't like them doesn't mean I'm going to control those choices", "Okay but ur just assuming she's going to leave tho. Leases can be broken. Either let ur kid make their own choices or dont", "Nope. Just cause ur paying doesn't give u control. That's like sayjng they're paying for college so they get to pick ur major. Op doesn't get a say. She's not the one living there.", "Okay, so you did have a good reason. I guess I saw red because I was thinking that you moved just because you wanted to be close to family or something, so I do apologize for that.\n\nHowever, I still think it's important for you to be acknowledging and apologizing for the impact that the move had on her, because as much as you are seeing her as a capable, adult woman, there's still a traumatized inner child. And I'm worried that this inner child feels like she did something wrong and that's why Amanda treated her so poorly, and that she wants to try to 'redo' things with Amanda, and that if she can get Amanda to like her, she'll feel like she's worthy of being loved and having friends.", "I think you\u2019re going to have to find a middle ground for how much you can engineer your daughter\u2019s life. She might have to learn this on her own, but it is reasonable to put some conditions on your funding. Some. Take another crack at a conversation but try to not approach it from a dictating standpoint or I know better than you.", "The way I approached it, at least IMO, was okay, I think? I started off with \"Okay, have we really thought about this with Amanda? Being honest, there's a history there.\" Plus, my two sons see Amanda for what she is, and loathe her. My daughter went immediately to the defensive, constructive criticism has always been tough to take. Her public speaking course in high school, the teacher laughed as he told us he had never seen anyone so passionate about every viewpoint. She gets it honestly from me, but I'm really trying to be flexible in my approach.", "Agreed! Op says in his post \"she's introverted and that's fine\" its not just fine, its who she is, an integral part that can't be changed. Also I know he means well but telling your kid they're going to cure cancer can be super anxiety inducing. She can be brilliant and not cure cancer. She can be brilliant and just do whatever in life and that is 'fine'.\n\nSorry I'm triggered, this one hit home. \n\nOp needs to back way off and let this birdy learn to fly.", "Well, hopefully friends and not fiends, lol. She's getting a part time job, my advice was 20 hours a week or so, nothing too big, but enough income to enjoy a life.", "\u2026why are you yelling?", "#  1 is a good rule nothing wrong with forcing one's self outside the comfort zone especially if she having a hard time and does want to make friends. #  3 is expecting way too much with the cost of living and gas alone. If she would be staying with you that's a great idea but expecting her to move out and all 3 of those things is really not in the realm of reality.\nEdit:idk how to format on the app so I really don't know how that happened", "Well, she cut off the discussion really quickly when I tried to broach the topic. She said \"We talked, and it's all good. We're much better now.\" I've heard it so many times, over and over. That's almost word for word what she said, and she was getting defensive really quickly, so I left it alone. I know she envisions this wonderful world where her and Amanda are as close as her and her other cousins, but I know Amanda, and it just won't work. I see her mother in her, my sister, and her mother is an absolute train wreck. She always has been. She got my mom to cosign for a car for her, and then defaulted on the loans and paid a friend $200 to steal it and set it on fire. Amanda has the same manipulative tendencies in her that I grew up right next to.", "The sum total of what she said,her justification, was that \"We spoke, and it's all good. We're in a better place now.\" That was what I got. And I've heard that a dozen times these past few years, when Amanda wounds her or destroys her, and then lures her back in a couple months later.", "She's not telling her she can't live with her cousin.  She saying if you live with her paying for it will be your responsibility.  \n\nIt makes sense because OP doesn't think Amanda is responsible.  She believes that Amanda will end up not paying rent.  If that happens, who do you think is paying.....not the 18 year old.  But OP.  \n\nSo yea the person who paying should get a say and should be allowed to say no", "Agree so hard. I don\u2019t speak to my mother because of all her \u2018protection\u2019 and \u2018love\u2019 that undermined my independence and my ability to advocate for myself. Let her make her mistakes on her terms. She will grow stronger for it. Be there. Counsel her. Don\u2019t force her to do what you think is best by using your financial threats. It\u2019s shitty honestly. A well meaning but ultimately yta", "I get what you're saying. I just don't know if I can pay for it. My youngest starts college in a year and a half, and if Amanda has screwed my daughter over, and I have to help cover more rent so her credit isn't destroyed right off the bat, then it will impact my ability to pay for his college, too. But I do see where it could be a good learning experience for her. That was a good point about better now than in 3 years.", "Well, I would say Amanda's parents could cosign, but that's my sister, and she's an evil person. Her and her husband opened a lease for a business in his daughter's name (my sister's stepdaughter), and almost immediately defaulted on the lease. My step-niece had her credit ruined, right as she was getting married, and wound up being $7000 in debt overnight. She (sister) opened lines of credit in my older sister's name, who is developmentally disabled, and then defaulted and ruined HER credit. Her and I are NC. And I'm more concerned about what Amanda will do to my daughter as a person. It was less than a year ago, they were in high school, and she told everyone how my daughter lost her virginity, her boyfriend was probably gay and my daughter was his beard, awful things like that. I know my daughter wants desperately to have someone she knows, I just think this is terrible.", "I think the character limit in the thread kind of hindered that. Amanda has come after her time and time again. I've watched her do it to her brother when he was younger, to my own youngest son, where she tried to destroy him at school right as he started high school, which is such a terrible time already for kids. She was involved in vandalizing the school before they graduated, she was the ringleader, she was pushing everyone to go further and further, and when the school discovered the level of vandalism, and police got involved, she ran to the administration and gave everyone else's name, so they didn't cross the stage, but she did. \n\nAs for my daughter, I'm far from controlling her. Lol. If I even tried, she'd wrestle me to the ground. Financially, I can't do it when it inevitably goes south. But mentally, I can't do it, because I know Amanda's cruelty to everyone close to her.", "It's not that, I don't think. She describes it to us as when she's alone in her own head, she'll start to spiral. She starts criticizing herself and really beats herself up. She's very close with her brothers, and not being around them or their girlfriends impacts her. She really only likes a small circle of friends, but she has always needed a little push to get out there a little more.", "Well, in the title and in the paragraph, that was what I was saying. If I'm paying the rent, she can't live with Amanda. If Amanda lives with her, she will have to pay the rent.", "The thing is yes when adults make choices they are the one who faces the consequences.  In this scenario if OP daughter makes the choice of living with her cousin and it doesn't work out her daughter isnt the one affected.  OP is, they are the one who has to pay. \n\nI would 100% agree if OP adult daughter was paying her rent the lease is in her name and OP not involved.  That's not the case here", "There are often financial consequences involved with breaking a lease, and it's not always easy to do.  I'm not saying that OP is right with their ultimatum, I just want to point out that breaking a lease isn't always cut and dry.  Sometimes it depends on the reason for breaking it.", "I haven't really been able to wrap my head around why she keeps Amanda around. Less than a year ago, Amanda told most of her grade how she had lost her virginity, that her boyfriend was probably gay and she was a beard, things like that. Just to be cruel. And they were barely speaking then. She just comes back to this mindset that she should be close with her cousins, because she's so close with her other cousins. I've tried explaining that sometimes, there are just rotten people, from an early age.\n\nWe've really worked hard over the years to let them know that the choice we made to move here wasn't ideal, and definitely wasn't what we wanted. She's very, very close to my father, and she's absolutely loved that part of the move back here. All of the kids have. And she knows that we didn't have a choice. We've apologized tried to find ways for her to see her friends from where we used to live,things like that. It's just a shitty situation that happened.", "> \"Okay, have we really thought about this with Amanda? Being honest, there's a history there.\"\n\nThat was condescending as fuck.", "There's ALOT of red flags in this post. Based on the wording I'd be willing to bet that these parents have either explicitly demanded (or consistently \"nudged\") their daughter towards being exceptionally high performing.\n\nChoosing a career that her parents would approve of, going to school they approve of etc. And then tying financial support these expectations? Honestly it kinda makes me a little physically ill.\n\nSo much pressure to put on a child.\n\nAnd if OP's daughter is anything like me, there will come a point where her parent's expectations for her and her own wants and needs will become so conflicted that she'll completely mentally break down.\n\nI had a mental breakdown in my 3rd year of university and had to take 6 months off. I had no identity of my own. I had completely surrendered myself and my identity to my parent's expectations. It took YEARS of therapy untangle my needs and wants with my parents' expectations.\n\n*Add: For the record my parents weren't push or demanding at all in terms of my career goals. They just wanted me to work hard, earn a good living and stand on my own two feet. I had internalised alot of their goals for me as gospel and convinced myself that that is what I wanted too so I wouldn't disappoint them.* \n\n*I have amazing parents that I love very very much.

Really seems like your bias for your sister is informing your behavior, not your daughter's own agency in decision making. You could be 100% right, but she is an adult. Perhaps it is time for her to either prove Amanda is all good, or that your instincts were right. Either way, I'd value giving my daughter the respect to make this choice and see it fail or succeed by her own hand, than make that choice for her and have her resent me.\n\nMaybe a conversation around \"I really worry about you, and about how she treated you in the past. I never want to see you sad like that again. But I trust you and the woman you are becoming, and won't stop this. I hope it works out for you.\"\n\nBut make sure Amanda is paying her own way for her portion of the rent.", "Honestly I feel like your daughter has some self confidence issues that you can help her with. She may just need to hear that she doesn't deserve to be treated that way and asking why she thinks Amanda has changed her spots, with the focus on your daughter and what she deserves/hasn't had in the past. \n\nI guess I'd want to know why she thinks Amanda is being genuine and if she is not just being pressured into accepting this arrangement because she sees it as better than the alternative. Part of her defensiveness may be her own reservations and fears, maybe you can just focus on asking her more questions and emphasize that you don't want her to be hurt again more that what you will/won't allow. \n\nIf you are not comfortable supporting the arrangement financially that's totally justified, you can point out to your daughter that you don't want to cosign on a lease with a roommate that you are concerned will flake out.

It\u2019s very obvious that Op is trying to push her daughter into the situation she wants by presenting her with this \u201cchoice.\u201d\n\nA choice is two possibilities you pick from without intentional outside pressure.

Not do you want to wear black socks, you can wear blue ones but if you do I\u2019ll slap you upside the head, your choice.", "She is tho that's like the whole point of the post.

Also, have you asked her views on this at all?  Why is she willing to move in with this cousin if she's so bad?  Would the cousin's parents be willing to guarantee her portion of the rent?", ">I\u2019m more concerned about what Amanda will do to my daughter as a person\n\nSorry, that seems to contradict several of your comments, which indicate that your primary concern is the potential cost?\n\nI would also be very concerned about Amanda being around your daughter, but it really depends on how much you want to let her make her own decisions/mistakes and learn from them versus shielding her entirely.

There was a girl in Jr. High who used to push me into lockers and say awful things and grab my hair and... then she would be nice. I sucked up to her so badly in spite of no one liking her, her being in constant trouble, etc. because I was afraid of her, and when she stopped the violence momentarily I wanted to believe that it would last. I thought I could control her behavior by being nice, and that I'd finally convinced her that I was an okay person. (It didn't last, as I'm sure you've guessed).\n\nMaybe you can get a little more context from her on whether she feels some pressure to do this, or is just blindly trusting that things will improve. It's possible that she has some trepidations of her own. If you have any nightmare roommate stories of your own that may help to illustrate the long term implications of a lease.

It's at least possible that this is partially the case with her. \n\nShe's an adult, she can make her own decisions, but you don't have to support bad decisions financially.
