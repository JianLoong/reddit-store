We told her that she could just give us $15k and we would sign an acre over to her, so she could build a little house by the farm and come visit now and then. (She's also mentioned some money troubles and we didn't want her to be in a bad spot, we also felt bad getting so much from her as a gift). She has transferred $6500 to us so far before we told her to hold off on sending any more. \n\nIt turns out that she needed to borrow all the money from my brother, he transferred the full $15k to her, and she told us she could only send us a little at a time due to limits on her bank. (So we thought)\n\nProblem arose when I talked to my brother the other day, turns out she never told him we didn't need $20k, never told him we didn't need it upfront, nor did she mention that she hasn't even sent us the full amount yet.  So my brother loaned out his entire savings, and that money has just disappeared. He is extremely depressed about this, and I'm feeling horrible for putting myself in the middle. If it was me, I would have wanted to know that my mom lied and basically stole my money.\n\nEdit: if we were able to return what was loaned we would.

This isn't the 1st time she has done something like this either.", "That is what my thought was. If it was me, I would want to know. I just feel like I did it for selfish reasons, and I didn't want him to resent me for not being able to buy his own house and thinking it was my fault", "My brother is on the spectrum and isn't the most well versed in confrontation. One of the reasons I felt so bad telling him is I knew he wouldn't say anything about it, and would just stew on it, but I would want to know if I was him.

I just feel horrible because I knew he would take it badly, but I hate seeing my big brother be taken advantage of", "Her plan was for us to sign over her acre after she paid for it, and use the land as collateral for a construction loan", "We are not or we absolutely would. We farm, so we used the $6500 she had sent over for our fencing, paying the house insurance for the year in advance, and other costs for movingall of our livestock and equipment.

Literally just found that out within the last 3 days. Also, where does it say there are no plans to return it?\n\nPretty shitty to say I'm just as bad as the person who lied and stole from their own child just because I didn't know. If I was that shitty I wouldn't have told him in the first place.", "It helps cause he will know better. You can help him learn to say no. You can help him know what his mother did was wrong. You can help him learn you can\u2019t trust someone blindly even if it is a parent.\n\nAnd finally, you can help him get the money back from your mother and if that means suing your mother so her money is garnished or giving that acre to your brother, so be it.", "In that case, I would do a family meeting with her, him and you. \nYou may need to speak for him, or encourage him as moral support there, but it needs to be addressed and you are now in the middle of it. \nShe needs to be called out for this and an accounting of where the money went and a plan to pay it back. No more sneaking.", "You weren't wrong, he deserves to know. IF he didn't know, wouldn't he still be as stressed?", "But if the land is only worth $20K how was she going to get a construction loan of say $100K - $200K?", "Virtual hugs for you and your brother. You can't feel them but they're there. I just picture your brother walking around looking like a puppy that just got kicked. I hope it works out for everyone", "I don't know what the details of her plan were exactly. She was going to build a small house, and she makes very good money on paper, just none of us know how she is so damn bad at managing it. Personally, we would just as rather she not be living there, which is one of the reasons we told her to not give us the rest of the $ just yet. \nMy husband is thinking about calling the entire thing off until she pays my brother back and once she pays for the acre out of her own money we can put the deal back on the table.  \n\nIt also wouldn't have cost her nearly that much. The state we live in is fairly cheap with housing. My husband would have built her house pad for her to cut costs as well", "My dad says he does. My brother just gets taken advantage of so easily, and my mom is a master manipulator/guilt tripper, he's the \"perfect target' for someone like her. I'll be putting my foot down for him. Thank you very much. He's my best friend and it's so shitty what our mom did to him", "This doesn\u2019t really make sense. She \u201cmakes lots of money\u201d but had to borrow $20K from your brother.

I've already said a prayer for you both.", "I mean you are welcome to accuse me of lying, and I wish I was my dude. She makes almost $100k/year, but has refinanced her house to buy/work on another house out of the country, she is building a garage for her other house (which is where I personally believe my brother's $ went), she bought a car for them to keep over there as well, she owns another piece of land in the same country that has nothing on it either, and has tons of credit cards. \nThey like to go out and eat out a lot as well, which isn't a crime but she has multiple cards that she owes thousands on due to how much she likes to travel and spend money", "I don't know where you live, but that really isn't so much money in most of the US.", "Borrowed?

Your mother sucks for what she did.\n\nPerhaps your brother needs a financial POA? (Not your mother).  It might protect him in the future.", "The mom is manipulating her Autistic son out of his money, thousands of dollars and more than once; he needs an advocate because that is just evil.", "She lives WAY above her means. Multiple properties and houses that are still having to be paid on and credit cards", "Her plan was to get a construction loan, using the acre as collateral once it was signed over to her. But we will not sign it over until it is paid for in full. And now we want her to pay my brother back first before we will revisit that deal. My brother gets paid back before we will even think about selling her that land", "So, your brother is on the spectrum, and your mom essentially strong-armed him into giving her his savings? If he were a senior citizen, this would be elder abuse. As it is, this may be another form of abuse, but I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019d call it if it were. \n\nRegardless, YOU need to be protecting your brother from scams and scammers LIKE YOUR MOM. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for telling him. But you should be getting very confrontational on his behalf. If anyone else did this to him, a stranger for instance, how would you act? What would you do to them? What legal remedies would you try?

You SURE?", "This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done something like this but you didn\u2019t investigate where someone so bad with money was getting the cash to give to you?", "INFO\nMaybe I missed this part. Wouldn't it be your responsibility to pay him back the $6500 you got from your mom?\nNow that you know she was just the funnel, why wouldn't you be paying that back to him when you can? She didn't get the land, but you got the down payment  if that is not the plan YTA and so is your mom", "Holy fuck *why* are you still making big financial decisions with her?! Why is your brother anywhere near her, if she feels so free as to harass and manipulate an Autistic man out of his money, once again *multiple times*???? Both of you should be assuming the worst when she comes around with some business proposal or has her hand out!\n\nESH except for your brother; get that man his money and see if there's anything else you can do to prevent your mom taking advantage of him. It's not bad that you told him. He needs to know.", "If she has a 2nd house, she can sell one of them, and pay your brother back. Or your brother can sue her, and make her sell and repay.

I don't think he is angry enough about it, just depressed and no I don't want to be around that sort of person. Through the last few years she has changed in other ways into someone I don't recognize", "Disability abuse I believe is the term and it is heartbreakingly common.", "I am thankfully not. We were only selling her the acre because we know how she is with this stuff and we didn't want her to have a $15k favor to call in. Now we are not even going to think about revisiting the deal until she has paid him back in full. As for with my brother, I live in a different state than the 2 of them, and we are both in our 30s. It's not my business to be policing his interactions with our mother. I had no idea the scope of any of this until a few days ago, we talk but not in depth very often.
