{"id": 26049, "submission_id": "167nkks", "title": "AITA for revealing to my friend's fianc\u00e9 that she has been married twice before?", "selftext": "My [42m] friend [42f] of many years, who I am going to call \"Pam\" here, has been engaged since this spring. Planning on a Christmas wedding. Until recently, I only met the guy (let's call him \"Pete\") fairly briefly at a couple of social events and didn't know him that well.\n\nLast month, Pam invited me and a couple other friends (\"Paul\" and \"Paulina\") out drinking to get to know Pete. There was no discussion of off-limits topics beforehand. No mention that anything at all was being kept secret from Pete. Now, Pam does have a history of being a somewhat private and secretive person, with a VERY compartmentalized life, so this night out with her fianc\u00e9 did come as a surprise to us. Still, there was no briefing on things not to mention.\n\nWe were drinking, we were laughing, we were having a great time. Also, did I mention we were drinking?\n\nAt one point, Pam gets up to go to the bar, and I say to Pete, \"you're so much chiller and funner than Dave!\"\n\nHe just looks confused and says \"Dave?\"\n\nAnd without thinking why he would ask, my drunk ass goes \"her last husband, the dud.\" It never occurred to me he wouldn't already know.\n\nTo which he replies, \"she was married!? What do you mean her **last** husband?\"\n\nThe speakers in the bar were blaring, but you could feel a bubble of silence forming around us. Time slowed down.\n\nAnd then Paulina, ever so helpful, blurts out, \"he didn't matter, they were only married a few months. Her first one lasted eight years!\"\n\nPete looks at me and asks, \"is that true?\"\n\nI say \"yes.\" He gets up, drops some cash on the table, and leaves. Pam comes back and asks what's going on and all I can think to say was \"uh, apparently Pete didn't know about Dave or Michael?\" Her face goes paper white, and she follows Pete outside.\n\nThat was three weeks ago today, and the last I saw of her. She's not answering my calls or texts, and she's also cut off Paul and Paulina (even though Paul was pretty much drunk under the table). Pam doesn't do social media, but the three of us have learned from other friends that invitations have gone out, so they've patched up any disagreement that might have occured from the revelation. \n\nPaulina thinks that in hindsight, we should have know that's *exactly* the sort of thing Pam would hide from a fianc\u00e9. That does have a ring of truth to it knowing Pam. She's always been very judicious about what she reveals about herself, and when and to whom she reveals it. Perhaps I should have considered everything I know about her to be a secret. At the same time, I really don't feel like I did anything wrong, and that she should have mentioned it if she hadn't told him yet. Ex spouses are something you mention before the engagement, not after the honeymoon. She definitely should not have had a group of people who know a secret heavily drinking around the person she's keeping the secret from.", "created_utc": 1693613473, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167nkks/aita_for_revealing_to_my_friends_fianc\u00e9_that_she/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not on you for not reading her mind.", "NTA. She didn't tell you to keep it a secret, and in my opinion that's the kind of thing you shouldn't hide from someone you're planning to *marry*.", "NTA.\nSimple as that.\nIts just bad decisions of your friend biting her in the butt.", "NTA. You did the guy a favor.", "NTA. Her compartmentalization isn\u2019t a personality quirk.  It\u2019s because she is a liar.  She controls the information flow so nobody knows enough to call her bullshit.  \n\nYou aren\u2019t cut off because you committed a grievous faux pas. It\u2019s because you know too much.", "NTA  \nNot only is Pam an AH to her fiance but she's dumb. How she thought this would stay quiet without giving anyone a heads-up is a head-scratcher.  You are not supposed to have to intuit that your friend liking privacy means that she is a liar. There's a big difference.", "NTA.\nIt would have been outed nearer the time as she would have had to provide her divorce papers when doing the legal side of things.\nKinda a big thing to have not told him before they started planning a life together. Don't sweat it OP.", "NTA. This is public knowledge.", "I don't think it makes sense for you to compare boyfriends/fiances/partners, specially not the first time you meet them, even if it's to say something nice about the current one.\n\nHowever you are definitely NTA\n\nEveryone would have assumed two people that are engaged are familiar with the previous serious relationships their partners had.\n\nTBH if she had asked you to keep it a secret, I'd probably would have refused to go as I wouldn't want to be part of such a disrespect.\n\nBut she didn't tell her husband, she didn't tell you to keep a secret and it's something that is public knowledge. It was bound to happen.", "Do you really want to be friends with someone you have to curate the truth for? NTA", "I mean, mentioning the ex in any way is a shitty thing to do, even if it\u2019s a good comparison. Like, if I were Pam, and you brought up my ex to my fianc\u00e9, I\u2019d be annoyed. \n\nBut you had no way of knowing she didn\u2019t tell him. So NTA, but kinda borderline for me.", "NTA", "NTA. She should have told him about her past marriages. However I think it\u2019s kind of tacky to bring up your friend\u2019s past relationships in front of their current partner. A person\u2019s exes are their past so there\u2019s no reason to bring them up. It\u2019s very possible that the reason Paulina is angry is because she doesn\u2019t think you shouldn\u2019t have been discussing her exes at all, even if Paul did know about them.", "ESH.  Pam should have been honest with current fianc\u00e9.  \n\nBut, this was the first time you all were meeting him. You didn\u2019t need to bring up former guys.", "YTA.

(except Pete).   Pam for keeping that secret.  You for bringing up an ex.  Even if Pete had known, it was in very poor taste to compare him in that comment.", "ESH.  Not your place to air your friend's dirty laundry, and that isn't being a very good friend.  At the same time, keeping such important past events from a fiance is completely wrong too.", "NTA but stop using booze as an excuse.  Idea:  Don't get so stupid drunk.\n\nThe excuse is that nobody in their right mind would assume that your friend had hidden her marital history from someone she was going to marry.
