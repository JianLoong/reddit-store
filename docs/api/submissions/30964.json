You are the parent here and you don't have any obligation to continue to fund your sister's lifestyle, especially if she's just going to let it go to waste and does have those alternate arrangements.

It' true the preschool would be valuable to the child but they won't get that benefit if they aren't going, and if the idea was that she would apply for financial aid to cover the costs so it was only a short term thing , and that the plan was for her to be able to get a job to become independent, it sounds as though neither of those things is happening .\n\nIf you are still willing to help, you could tell her you will pay for one day a week but ton condition that she deals with the financial aid paperwork by the end of this month, and that moving forward, you will only pay for each month if nibling has attended every one of the days paid for on the previous month (i.e. your payment for November is dependent on full attendance in October, and so on)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you are perfectly fine to say no more at all because she hasn't kept her word", "Is there a preschool that is closer? Would the other grandparents be willing to take them to preschool if mom isn't? Does the preschool have a bus? You're NTA!
