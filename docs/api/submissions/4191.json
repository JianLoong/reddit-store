{"id": 4191, "submission_id": "zfa4a0", "title": "AITA for inviting my brother's ex to Christmas, even when his current one said she didn't want to?", "selftext": "My brother, John, dated Kiara for 10 years and they broke up 4 years ago (EDITED MY MISTAKE), because my brother didn't want to leave my city and Kiara got a great job opportunity outside the country, he made her choose between the job and him... She moved to another country. \n\nKiara and I became best friends while she dated my brother and we maintained our friendship even after the breakup. My brother always made it clear that he didn't like it, but I don't care. \n\nHe has been dating Pam for 3 years. She is 6 months pregnant and engaged to him for 7. Kiara is also dating a great guy. \n\nThe situation: \n\nThis year, the construction of my house was finally ready and it has a large leisure area and swimming pool, great for parties. Because of that, I decided to do Christmas at home and my parents and brothers agreed. \n\nIn all there will be about 30 guests (friends and family) to the party, including Kiara who is spending the end of the year here and I invited her. \n\nAs usual for my parties, I set up a message group with the adults at the party to discuss the menu and who was getting what. In that group was also Kiara, Pam and John. \n\nJohn called me asking if Kiara was in that group and when I confirmed it, he started saying that it would be weird to have his ex at the party and that it would be better if she didn't go so as not to make the situation difficult.\n\n I asked Kiara if she felt ok with them at the party and she said \"yes, why nota?\" so I just replied \"I want her there so she stays\". \n\nThis caused a stir and even Pam  called me saying that it would be too much awkward for Kiara to go and that she wouldn't want to go through stress even more pregnant, basically begging Kiara not to go\". \n\nI was already fed up and he replied \"Look, grow up, the relationship ended years ago and she is MY best friend, who unfortunately is John's ex, but it's my party and I won't stop inviting my friends because you don't want to. If you don't want to go, that's fine, I won't be upset, feel free.\"\n\n It didn't help the situation much, because now they are accusing me of choosing to make an awkward situation instead of family.\n\n My parents asked me to give up this idea to have peace on that day, but no one offered the house for this event. \n\nI understand being an ex and being annoying but it's still my party and Kiara came to the country to see friends.\n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for the english, fake names.\n\nSome points to clarify: \n\n1. Yes, I am much closer to Kiara than I am to my brother and Pam. He didn't introduce me to her, because we went to the same school, but it was because of him that I APPROACHED her. \n\n2. The party would take place at my house and it was always made clear that it would not be something so familiar, but something with family and friends, I invited my parents and extended my invitation to brothers,, making it very clear that there would be 20 more people in addition to the family . I left it open if they wanted to celebrate something more personal and I wouldn't be upset if I did, but they agreed to go to my party because it's more spacious for everyone. \n\n3. It was a peaceful break up, John just didn't like me keeping in touch with her because family must forget ex in his head", "created_utc": 1670439574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfa4a0/aita_for_inviting_my_brothers_ex_to_christmas/", "score": 3386, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand your side of it, but telling the family that you\u2019re taking over Christmas hosting duties and then not discussing the plan to invite the ex with your brother and his fianc\u00e9 in advance was a poor way to handle it. You could have at least prevented them from finding out on a group text about side dishes and appetizers.\n\nI get that it\u2019s your house, but as the host, it\u2019s your job to make sure everyone is comfortable and feels welcome.

You're not really wrong for wanting to invite them all but you are telling them that this friend is more important than your future niece/nephew and his/her parents feelings. It's too late to uninvite your friend now but not too late to apologize for not properly giving a heads up prior to doing so. For that YTA", "They were all on a group chat. She didn't hide it from him. Why should it be awkward. They have been apart for a really long time. Brother has moved on and has a pregnant gf. Does this mean they can never be in the same room forever? \n\nAnd OP is \"pushing\" her brother to be with his ex, they are invited to the same big party", "It maybe his GF who is uncomfortable. Knowing that if Kiara hadn't left,  the love of her life would have been with Kiara", "I'm not sure where you got \"high school girlfriend\" from. OP states this was a decade-long relationship. I can't imagine a single soul who would be comfortable with this, unless it was the most amicable breakup, like, of *all* time. If OP doesn't care then so be it, but most people would be considerate of that.", "Yeah my family usually does the friend party on the 23rd.", "He's the one who gave the ultimatum that ended their relationship in the first place", "I agree. He has the right to put an ultimatum down but you better do so realizing that both presented options are viable ones. It sounds more like he wanted to control her answer than anything. She didn't pick him and he's upset about it even though he's the one that forced the decision.", "But she is also entitled to choose the job opportunity over a a bf not a husband.\n\nThey both made their choice years ago time to move on and worry bout his pregnant wife.", "It sounds like OP was already changing family Christmas by having a big party full of non-family members. I do wonder if the compromise would actually be a second event just for family.", "Then if they don't want a party they can host a family gathering thenselves?? You can't be like, \"oh yeah I'm okay with a generalized party with people I don't know\" then bitch because one person is being too far in his emotions over a person he dumped. \nHe literally has no obligation to acknowledge the ex, and its not like out of a dozen or more of unknown friends the wife would know who the ex is, or that there even was an ex there to begin with, without him making a big deal over it. OP is NTA", "But it might be nice to feel comfortable at a family Christmas party.", "I kept my mil and half the siblings. They're still in contact with my ex but they like me more and will state that. The ex and I have been around each other, not in years by his choice due to his new wife, but we can hang out together and be cordial with each other.", "Bingo", "Sounds like OP didn't move on.. From a relationship that wasn't hers.", ">Exactly, what if they attended the same church? Would Ex have to find a new church because it would be too awkward?", "Yes, she invited her best friend of nearly 15 years along with 19 others. And she said she\u2019s much closer with her best friend then she\u2019s with her brother or his fianc\u00e9. And she said it\u2019s absolutely fine if they don\u2019t want to come, especially when they feel uncomfortable.", "\"decided to take over\".\n\nShe purposefully left open that they could have Christmas in a more family setting elsewhere.\n\nThere's no hostile takeover here. \n\nOf course break ups can leave scars. They probably did. Seems there's plenty of time to make a smaller gathering elsewhere without the need of drama.\n\nNTA", "They were together for 10 and have been broken up for 4, so closer to a friend of 15 years!", "Why should Kiara be defined only through her past relationship with the brother? She's OP's best friend.", "OP invited her best friend to to the party SHE is hosting.\n\nI suspect the the brother doesn't want his pregnant fiancee to see that he hasn't moved on as much as he claims.", "Per the edits it does.", "Ok, but adults are able to spend an evening in a house with 30 people, which include one person they hate. Most people have one or two relatives they hate at every family gathering anyway. Adults just deal.", "She did say in her notes that she is closer to Kiara than to her brother. And it's a holiday party, but not a family party, where inviting to ex as a former family member would definitely be in your face, current gf.", "I would probably like the ex better than the brother too.  After all, the brother was trying to stop their friendship even when Kiara hadn't done anything wrong.", "Yeah I can see that. I think it\u2019s really nice that you are close to your brother. I could never live with my brother, and I wish things were different. There is no shame in prioritizing chosen family over biological family. Every family dynamic is different and not all can be lucky enough to have a \u201cfamily comes first\u201d outlook.", "Yes. Funny how \u201cI decided to stay home and told them I wanted to do Christmas\u201d turned into \u201cI took on this major burden because nobody else wanted to\u201d once the critical comments started \ud83d\ude02", "Its a little different when its an ex than just a family member, i dont know about you but i dont sleep with my family \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "Had you not included the /s, you might have had a point", "I don't know. Unless there was abuse, I don't give a second thought to exes and am completely unbothered by their existence. Maybe in the immediate aftermath of the break up, it makes sense to avoid them, but once you've moved on, it's really disrespectful to your current partner to get so flustered about an ex. I don't know what past sex has to do with it. I guess some people are really weird and hung up on sex or on exes being a thing. At this point, OP's brother should just see her as his sister's friend.", "I'm loving all the misandry here. \n/s", "Not being comfortable and not being capable of acting like an adult are not the same. Please don\u2019t be obtuse here and conflate the two. Not wanting to celebrate Christmas at your sibling\u2019s with your ex of 10 years and your pregnant fianc\u00e9 is a perfectly normal way to feel.", "Are you being purposefully obtuse or is multi variable analysis outside of your skill set? 2 things can be true. This can be functioning as the family Christmas party and it can also be a non exclusively familial engagement. OP has already made it clear that if the family wants to make other arrangements they are more than welcome to and it\u2019s no skin off her back. Sounds like everyone other than OPs brother and fianc\u00e9 have decided they prefer to take advantage of the nice space and freedom from responsibility of hosting by COMBINING their family Christmas party with OPs general Christmas party. They are not entitled to dictate the guest list.", "Well OP is the sister but i get what youre saying. Also i dont think being hurt by someone is disrespectful to your current partner. Humans are fragile, to feel betrayed by your partner of 10 years would be unbearable i would think.", "Lol, the person you think is agreeing with you was being sarcastic", "Are you OPs brother?", "It\u2019s not misandry to expect your brother, who is FULLY invested in a new relationship to grow up. It\u2019s not hating your brother to want you best friend, who is visiting from another country, to attend the huge party you are throwing. If he is that uncomfortable around the ex, he shouldn\u2019t go. Why should his sister have to suffer bc he married someone else while still being attached to his ex?", "Except if it\u2019s functioning as the family Christmas party then the family should be comfortable and not be made to feel unwelcome. This shouldn\u2019t be hard to understand.", "People who start dating young need to get permanence out of their head. They should just be happy they got to spend their early adulthood with a stable partner by their side. It should be positive memories, not painful ones. I'm sure he thinks his wife is a much better match for his adult self.", "YTA for the simple fact that when your brother said he\u2019d be uncomfortable you dismissed it, but instead asked kiara if she would be comfortable. I can see why you and your brother aren\u2019t close. Him and Pam are better off somewhere else for the holidays.", "YTA cmon", "YTA\nMaybe you and your brother don\u2019t have a good relationship because you chose his ex over him years ago. You knew this would cause a problem and you just didn\u2019t care. No normal human thinks this isn\u2019t going to be uncomfortable for someone. You just want to rub it in that you\u2019re still friends with his ex, like a he made a poor decision or something. Just don\u2019t get offended if you aren\u2019t invited by family moving forward.", "Plus there's going to be a lot of other people there. They literally won't have to interact with her at all. They're making a big deal over nothing.", "NAH. OP has the right to invite who she chooses to her house and her brother has the right to be uncomfortable about her guest list and choose not to attend.\n\nOPs only issue is who she values more, the friend or her brother. She's going to alienate one because of this. That's no-one's fault, its just what happens when rifts happen in groups. \n\nI won't judge. OP knows who is more important in their lives. The only thing I can say is that you can't always have everything be the way you want. If your brother considers this a serious boundary for him, then you'll have to deal with the fallout of that.\n\nEveryone is entitled to their own feelings and boundaries - and unfortunately they won't always align. You just need to consider the consequences of all your choices and decide which is the one you'd be most willing to live with.", "okay but his ex is her bestfriend of many years\u2026 different situations", "Yeah that\u2019s clearly not the case with them and her friend is visiting from another country, I would be willing to let my brother miss my party in order to see my friend who lived abroad. After all he\u2019s the one with the problem,", "Tell me your completely insecure without telling me your insecure.", "She\u2019s ok with them not coming though. If my friend who lives abroad is in town for the holidays they would 1000% take a priority in the invite hierarchy. Kira has no issue with them being there so the people with the issue should be the people who don\u2019t come.", "Nothing wrong with that.", "The thing is that if he doesn\u2019t go he probably won\u2019t have much family to be with this year. That\u2019s pretty shitty and does put him in a tough spot. Maybe they can celebrate with her family?", "Yeah, I'm not really clear on why OP decided to take over the family day and turn it into a friends and family day, and it all smells a bit off to me. She could have talked to brother before, she could have arranged a different set of dates with ex, she could have hosted a friends party specifically... she instead breezed past all of those and went for the \"don't discuss this potentially awkward invite conflict that never came up in part Christmases and which, ex being out of the country everyone else would reasonably still never expect would come up.\" Family or not, that's just being a bad host. Not every friends in one's friends list is compatible and it would always make sense to consider things like exes. Instead she made it a bigger problem than it needed to be then blamed ex, who brought it up as soon as he noticed what she'd done,and she dropped the problem on his head. Come and be uncomfortable for Christmas, or stay away and risk being blamed for family fractures that appear when he doesn't. I'm getting vibes like the stories on the JN sub groups, where family members just casually invite an ex and complain \"well *I* like her so she's part of the family now!\" while new partner is quietly but firmly iced out.", "Lol this group. On the one hand \"they looked at me funny is plenty of reason for NC\". On the other hand \"Why can't people just get over any left over shit from their EXs and hang out\". \n\nAfter 10 years with someone there will ALWAYS be left over shit. Maybe nostalgia, maybe sadness, maybe who knows what because the only people who know the quiet unspoken parts are the people who were in it. \n\nWanting not have to be reminded of that previous done part of your life during an occasion about being with family and you're focusing on your new relationship and upcoming baby is 10000% understandable. \n\nIt's the OPshousr, so sure her party her rules. But other people are still alllowed to have their feelings and make their own choice. It's unclear if this was meant to be a THE family Xmas party which she extended the scope, or just some other party. \n\nIf this was gonna be the Family party, OP is YTA. By pushing the friend issue she's changing the point of the party for the rest of the family. Her prioritization of her friend over the brother makes this no longer the family party. Drama is a natural consequence. \n\nIf it's just another party, NAH. She can invite her friend and her brother can decide not to come.", "Then you lack empathy. Most people don't wan to see their Ex on Christmas. It's not a totally crazy idea.", "I disagree here. 10 years, is a really long time to be with someone. It\u2019s implied that they only broke up over a job. So no one like fell out of love or something like that. I mean, all of OP\u2019s family probably thought, yeah, kiara is brother\u2019s person for life. Feelings like that don\u2019t just go away, and even when you move on and love someone else just as much, it\u2019s kind of absurd to pretend like there\u2019s not a part of your heart that wonders what it would have been like if things went differently, and probably a part of him still loves her, considering she took up 1/8th of his life. That\u2019s not an invalid reason to feel uncomfortable.", "Well then she won't mind, when she will not be a part of her brother's family in the future.", "It's also pretty normal to like a friend because you share interests and have compatible personalities more than a sibling you're just obliged to be loyal to through an accident of birth.", "\"The only reason they split up because of a job\" misses it.  They broke up because the job opportunity was more important to her than her relationship with him, and living in the city was more important to him good relationship with her.  Ten years together, they were not one another's priorities, and went their separate ways.", "Why? Because he still isnt over her and is afraid Pam will find out", "I would understand if he wasn\u2019t engaged with a baby on the way. Him dating Kira for 10 years means that Kira was also in the sisters life for that long too. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for having a relationship with her and inviting her to an event SHE is throwing.", "I wouldnt say nothing wrong with it, but shes certainly entitled to who she chooses to like or not", "OP mentions that she met her in high school. For all we know, those 10 years are from 15 to 25.", "She probably won\u2019t", "This is a good point- its ok to be a little uncomfortable sometimes! A mature adult could say \"well this is awkward\" and laugh it off, or gravitate to a different part of the party as that person, or something. The world doesn't need to cater to his discomfort. If he and his wife decide that the situation would be more discomfort than they are willing to withstand, and the joy to be found with the other party guests isn't worth it, then they're welcome to sit this one out. It's not like OP is surprising anyone with the ex's presence.", "That \"not right\" could still just as easily rest with him, though.", "Not necessarily, I've known people who just don't think you should have anything to do with a friend or relatives ex, no matter if the break up was amicable & if they have a friendly relationship with that person.", "She's closer to Kiara... she said that", "Even in that situation, it would still be 7 years of an actual adult relationship.", "If anything, that makes it\u2019s even harder to deal with. SO much development happens from 15 to 25, and if (as we technically don\u2019t know if those were the ages) they stayed together throughout that whole time, I mean, those are the times you tell your kids about. A huge chunk of his life had Kiara as a priority, and that\u2019s not something that just goes away", "So I'm speaking with the info we've been given and you're making assumptions, you know what they say about those who ASSume.", "I think Jon should invite OP's ex to the party too.  I am guessing that would not go over to well.", "I'm still friends with my ex's mom; she has met my long-term partner a few times. I have no idea how her son feels about it and don't care. \n\nI think if I were to run into my ex at Christmas, I'd be pretty happy, though - I always feel like, if I liked someone enough to date them, they are probably still cool people, just not for me.", "He clearly expected in a \"work or me\" ultimatum she'd give up the job for him", "Bingo! This is the real issue. He gave her an ultimatum 4 years ago probably thinking she'd choose him and she didn't. New wife I'm sure knows the situation and is why she feels a certain way. This sounds like a \"them\" problem regardless. NTA, OP.", "I don't know about you, but i have friends that are very far-flung, and it actually CAN be really difficult to make time to see them. Although they're in the country or on the same coast or in the same state for several days or weeks, theyre also trying to do a circut to fit as many visits with as many people as they can while they're in the area. So this party may well be the only window OP has to get a good visit in with Kiara before she heads off to the next visit, or out of the country.", "It's totally ok to like a friend more than a relative; we make friends over shared interests, compatible personalities, congruent values, etc. A sibling, you just happen to be born into the same household. This sub derides \"bUt FaMiLy!!!\" attitudes all the time, why not here?", "My ex wasn't a great guy, and he's a horrible father to his kids. I can put up with him and I can be friendly for my son and his family but his new wife doesn't like him around them either, unless they need something. My mil has babysat for me so I can go on dates and we've had girls night when my son was with my ex. She also came and saw me off for deployments. I won in the mil department, she was even the one who started telling everyone that I won custody of her in the divorce lol.", "In this situation, someone has taken a family tradition, and turned it into a christening.", "Sorry about your lame ex, I'm so glad you got to keep his mom.", "At some point, you have to realize that an ex from YEARS ago wasn't meant to be.  Or you WOULD be.  It's not healthy to keep wallowing over something like this, 4 years later and expect his family and friends to cut their ties.  That's selfish.  Especially if they had been together for 10 years?\n\nI say this as someone who was with my ex fiancee for 11.5 years.  I will always have some kind of, you know, nostalgia over \"what if\".   But I absolutely can acknowledge that I have to move on.  \n\nIts not the same for everyone, true.  But to hold on to that hurt, for years?  Seems unhealthy.  How can he be giving his all to his current wife, and future child, if he can't even exist in a space for a few hours civilly with someone who HE broke up with after HE gave HER an ultimatum?  \n\nTo me, it reads that he was trying to strong arm his ex into staying and abandoning her career, he failed and is upset about it.   If he had succeeded he would have had an unhappy girlfriend, and he wouldn't be with his current wife, so idk why he's so upset and can't exist in the same space as his ex unless he secretly regrets his decision to break up with her.", "Right and its hard to judge a whole family dynamic off of a single reddit post. I wouldnt say theres no shame, but i would understand if a family is dysfunctional you wouldnt have issue having deeper bonds with people you choose. It would be really difficult i think to have a family situation like that", "It's disrespectful to be hindered on a ex to the point where your wife knows and is uncomfortable imo. She'd just have to know her my sister's friend. I dint give a fuck about the chick anymore, why am I gonna highlight to my partner \"oh yeah HERES the one I was fucking for 10 years and dumped because she wanted to further her carrer\"", "Why would there be same? That\u2019s so judgmental! You don\u2019t need to shame people who don\u2019t have the same family life as you.", "Because it's important information for your partner to have. Especially if it's an ex that is still in your life or the life of your family one way or the other", "Thats not what i mean, i mean im sure that you would feel some shame coming from a dysfunctional family. Not that you arent worth as much or anything like that, but that it would produce a miltitude of negative emotions. Feeling shame isnt inherently a bad thing either, our emotions exist to guide us, too much of one emotion is the problem", "You're right, I'm absolutely taking a step back from this conversation \ud83d\ude0a", "Nothing more than a passing comment if it's even needed. High chance they might not even realize the ex would be there in that type of party. And even that comment wouldn't be fixating in her. \"Ugh God that's my sisters best friend I dated a while ago.

Seems like they may have been in a relationship of convenience that ultimately lacked staying power and commitment, feelings were lukewarm and they both walked away to do something else.  Ten years and you leave for a job / don't follow your partner when they leave for a job?

He's inadvertently made Kiara a *bigger* deal by literally centering her in the entire conversation, rather than reassuring his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nAs for the fianc\u00e9e, I can appreciate she's probably really nervous about meeting the \"one that got away\" and who's still connected so closely with the overall family. Fwiw, the best way to see she has nothing to worry about is to see that they are truly, amicably over.

I was only with my ex for ~4 years (compared to this guy's 10) and it's been ~3.5 years since we broke up (on good terms). I don't still have feelings for them, but for 4 years we were two halves of a whole. We were in love. That has a lasting impact beyond labels. I wouldn't want to be around them at any point in the future because of the mental impact it all had on me, the thought of it gives me 'collywobbles' (as you so maturely put it) even though I've moved on, am in a great relationship, and have done a great deal of processing those emotions. We don't get to dictate how other people feel about things, especially things that caused them pain (which their breakup obviously did).\n\nWith emotional situations, it's important to understand that everyone feels and processes things differently, and so something one person wouldn't get too upset over might have a much more significant effect on someone else.
