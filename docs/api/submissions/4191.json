She moved to another country. \n\nKiara and I became best friends while she dated my brother and we maintained our friendship even after the breakup. My brother always made it clear that he didn't like it, but I don't care. \n\nHe has been dating Pam for 3 years. She is 6 months pregnant and engaged to him for 7. Kiara is also dating a great guy. \n\nThe situation: \n\nThis year, the construction of my house was finally ready and it has a large leisure area and swimming pool, great for parties. Because of that, I decided to do Christmas at home and my parents and brothers agreed. \n\nIn all there will be about 30 guests (friends and family) to the party, including Kiara who is spending the end of the year here and I invited her. \n\nAs usual for my parties, I set up a message group with the adults at the party to discuss the menu and who was getting what. In that group was also Kiara, Pam and John. \n\nJohn called me asking if Kiara was in that group and when I confirmed it, he started saying that it would be weird to have his ex at the party and that it would be better if she didn't go so as not to make the situation difficult.\n\n I asked Kiara if she felt ok with them at the party and she said \"yes, why nota?\" so I just replied \"I want her there so she stays\". \n\nThis caused a stir and even Pam  called me saying that it would be too much awkward for Kiara to go and that she wouldn't want to go through stress even more pregnant, basically begging Kiara not to go\". \n\nI was already fed up and he replied \"Look, grow up, the relationship ended years ago and she is MY best friend, who unfortunately is John's ex, but it's my party and I won't stop inviting my friends because you don't want to. If you don't want to go, that's fine, I won't be upset, feel free.\"\n\n It didn't help the situation much, because now they are accusing me of choosing to make an awkward situation instead of family.\n\n My parents asked me to give up this idea to have peace on that day, but no one offered the house for this event. \n\nI understand being an ex and being annoying but it's still my party and Kiara came to the country to see friends.\n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for the english, fake names.", "created_utc": 1670439574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfa4a0/aita_for_inviting_my_brothers_ex_to_christmas/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand your side of it, but telling the family that you\u2019re taking over Christmas hosting duties and then not discussing the plan to invite the ex with your brother and his fianc\u00e9 in advance was a poor way to handle it. You could have at least prevented them from finding out on a group text about side dishes and appetizers.\n\nI get that it\u2019s your house, but as the host, it\u2019s your job to make sure everyone is comfortable and feels welcome. I\u2019m a pretty level headed person, and waddling into family Christmas 7 months pregnant and having to spend the evening with my husband\u2019s ex would not be high on the list of things that would make for an enjoyable holiday.

He is still being a selfish ah."]}
