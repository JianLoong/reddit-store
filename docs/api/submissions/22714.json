If you aren't going to follow his advice, why hire him?", "LOL dudes doing his job and trying to push you towards the goal you told him so you get frustrated that you backslid and gave up good luck improving", "ESH but I can see his frustration with you", "YTA, its kinda obvious that most people in Reddit dont work out. Personal Trainers should push you towards your goal, but it looks like you dont give a fuck about your weight gain. I understand that he doesnt want to work with you since your not following his advise anyways and then even argue with him.", "Going against the grain here\u2026.\n\nESH\n\nYou are being laissez faire about your lack of effort and commitment.  Look, a healthy weight isn't achieved or maintained by not following through with the work required. That means keeping up on your movement and calories. I can see why he\u2019s frustrated when you dont care and he feels he's wasting his time. Ya he should have let it go because at the end of the day its all on you and he did his part. However, do you even want to get healthy? Youre wasting your time and his and the poor attitude of \u201cwhatever\u201d isnt one I would want to work with personally.", "NTA\n\nThing is, it's not likely you gained 18lbs of fat in 4 weeks. You would have needed a 63,000 calorie surplus to do that - in other words an extra 2250 calories per day on average.\n\nWhat has probably happened is that you gained some weight but are also retaining water, either from salty food or from hormones. And you trainer should have known that. So aside from being unpleasant, I don't think your trainer was very knowledgable and I wouldn't trust his expertise.", "Yta.\n\nYour trainer should make you accountable for your actions, literally what you are paying them for.\n\nHe did not want to move on because you showed no remorse for the decisions you made.  You failing will directly effect his ratings (if he were to put ratings out)", "Yes you absolutely are. You don\u2019t like being held accountable.\n\nYou can\u2019t hold yourself accountable and you\u2019re arguing with the person you pay to hold you accountable. You need Goggins.", "Why are you using pt If you dont give a shit what they teach?", "NTA\n\nPTs should never make their clients feel bad about themselves, or their bodies. Ever. Obviously he wants you to lose weight and reach your goal, but making you feel guilty for gaining a bit of weight on vacation is ridiculous. If I were you, I'd find a new trainer.", "YTA.  Why have a personal trainer that you're just going to blow off and do what you want anyway?", "NTA.  Whilst some people might prefer a drill sargent approach, you do not and made that pretty clear.\n\n20lbs in 4 weeks... fair chance in a week or two that would level out.\n\nHe gets paid to help you reach your goals... you were very clear that you were aware that the weight wasn't good and wanted to move on.  Him being an AH about it doesn't do you any favours and possibly lost him a client.", "ESH 1 find someone more supportive and 2 there is no breaks you didn\u2019t listen to him because you gained 20 points not 2 or 5 or 10\u2026. If you want to loose weight then do it. You can\u2019t half ass it and expect it to work. Feel shitty about yourself and use it to push you forward so you don\u2019t feel that shitty again", "Nta but you need a better trainer who won\u2019t bully and shame you, and who will safely and steadily encourage and support you and your goals. It\u2019s okay that you haven\u2019t established sustainable habit yet. You will, one day at a time, setbacks happen but the overall trend will improve. This time next year is always the goal. If he\u2019s frustrated he shouldn\u2019t show that to you. He doesn\u2019t sound like much of an expert in his field tbh.", "NTA. \n\nSo many personal trainers are just naturally active people. Which means they will never understand that it\u2019s just harder for other people who don\u2019t find that stuff easy. \n\nWhich makes them really bad PTs for most people (I\u2019m sure they are great for Naturally Active people who just had a temporary hiccup, like breaking an ankle = a few months of low activity.)\n\nThere are some awesome trainers out there though, who struggled with stuff themselves, or are just naturally kind & non-judgemental. \n\nI spent about 3 years doing rehab stuff with an awesome Pilates guy. My mobility was terrible, and my adhd meant I didn\u2019t do anything between sessions. \n\nBut he was endlessly patient, and encouraging, and it\u2019s made a life-changing amount of difference.\n\nI think that it helped that he\u2019d been so active (dancer) he had injuries that needed recovery work. Maybe that\u2019s why he was so patient.", "gaining 20 pounds in two weeks is really unlikely that\u2019s probably mostly water weight. NTA it seems like his approach is really insensitive", "NTA\n\nYou are not paying him to judge you. He should be supporting and encouraging you. \n\nThe things he said would DIScourage me and make me feel despondent about my situation - and eat more for comfort.\n\nYou need to start from where you are now.  'Diets' are renowned for causing people to lose and then put on more weight in the longer term. \n\nIt's your responsibility but it's not your fault. There will be reasons why you overeat. And once you are overweight, exercise becomes more of a challenge.\n\nYou CAN change your habits but admonishment from the trainer will not help.  Neither will losing your self respect.", "NAH - Hey, just not the trainer for you. But he was just doing his job so im mot going to call him an AH for that.", "I see both sides to the issue. On and off fitness junkie myself; I've had my share of breaks.  Some were me being lazy, akin to \"extended Father's Day\", or injuries (i.e. bending your back while doing a deadlift or going too heavy).\n\nRegardless, breaks hinder your progress.  Your taking it as you did likely told the trainer that you don't care and that he feels like he's wasting your time and his, maybe he even feels morally like you're cheating yourself and he's angry at and for you.  You don't seem to mind, even if you're paying him/you took the break of your own accord, you know you dropped the ball and are ready to try again (which is the best attitude to have tbh).\n\nNAH", "NTA his attitude is awful! Way to shame the client. He might rationalise it as \u201ctough love\u201d or some similar bs (and that might work with some clients) but you clearly aren\u2019t one of those. You set a boundary and he disrespected it and you. Punishing you with extra reps, (again) might work for others, but seems like it just missed the mark with you.\n\nDitch the grouch and find a trainer that understands how to work with your personality and how to motivate you without resorting to shaming you. It sounds like you would do well with someone who will approach these issues with compassion and curiosity rather than judgement and punishment. \n\nGood luck with the new trainer!", "[deleted]", "NTA but I do kinda get his frustration. It's not ok to take it out on you, but he may have had clients that pull this kinda thing and then act like it's his fault so now he's automatically defensive. I have a SIL who works as a nutritionist and the amount of times she's had clients that blame her when they don't follow her plans boggles the mind.", "NTA\n\nYou're paying them, so why do they care? Their attitude sucks and I can see why you'd be frustrated.", "Nta, his attitude is very discouraging and makes him a bad trainer. That kind of set back and treatment could prevent you from reaching your goal. \n\nFind a new trainer OP. You took some steps back, but you clearly want to improve. Find a trainer and a regiment that you can work with and stay committed to. I'm all of tough love but you also need encouragement and something realistic", "NTA - your method of same reps & accepting unforeseen setbacks is more sustainable than punishing yourself when things don\u2019t work out. he sucks honestly.", "Nta. Your trainer sounds wack.", "Nta", "NTA. You pay him to motivate you, and he\u2019s bad at motivation. \n\nI feel it would be better if you reviewed your goals: not just \u2018drop weight\u2019 but \u2018build healthy exercise habits\u2019. (The irony is that one way of gaining weight is to build muscle). \n\nYou know to exercise and get back on the wagon. One thing a good fitness coach should help you with is to review what went wrong and how you can avoid gaining the same level of weight next time you\u2019re going to a calorie-rich, exercise-poor environment. \nThis is likely to be a combination of better eating habits (indulge without going overboard) and exercise habits (have a home routine, go for walks, play pokemon). \n\nI hope you can find a trainer who is more aligned with your goals.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If its a bad match, its a bad match.  Trainer not really the ahole either, just doesnt understand that weight gain isnt immediate, but to be fair, they are supposed to motivate you.

You research, you make adjustments, you get approval and everything is going well because everyone on your team is following your plan. Then you take a month vacation and come back and the plan is behind schedule, nobody listened or followed your instructions (that you most likely put in place to adjust for your absence) and not only do you have to start over, you are further behind than you were before you started. \n\nThat\u2019s how he feels. It is definitely your body! But good and professional personal trainers put a lot of time and effort into helping you meet *your* goals. And to see you sort of brush it off can be upsetting.

That is dangerous.", "It's a results based industry someone who doesn't stick to a plan and who isn't getting results isn't worth the time investment.

The other client was going to listen and work hard. Yeah, you can absolutely waste someone's time despite them being paid. People can have personal goals, they want to achieve things at work, they want to be successful, they want to do better. In this case a personal trainer will measure their success by how well their clients do, wasting time on clients is entirely possible.", "He could be spending time with a client who actually sticks to the plan.  OP has laid out a history of inconsistency even in the time she's been with this trainer, and he was right that she has a laissez faire attitude.  She admits herself that she is taking 1 step forward and two back, then took off for a month.  She's made downhill progress this whole time and then argues with him when he tries to get her back on track.  To him, that could absolutely be a waste of his time.  Maybe he doesn't want to just be a talking head to someone who doesn't want to get the work done.  He can't help someone who isn't helping themselves."]}
