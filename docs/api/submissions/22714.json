Your taking it as you did likely told the trainer that you don't care and that he feels like he's wasting your time and his, maybe he even feels morally like you're cheating yourself and he's angry at and for you.

Punishing you with extra reps, (again) might work for others, but seems like it just missed the mark with you.\n\nDitch the grouch and find a trainer that understands how to work with your personality and how to motivate you without resorting to shaming you.

Her issues aren\u2019t likely going to be solved with just a trainer, and a good trainer understands if someone gains that much in such a short time, there is likely more at play than he is equipped to handle.", "Distorted is dead on. Life long eating disorder holder here. I\u2019ve had to weight restore several times in my life, usually the gain goal being 40-50 pounds. Even when it is medically necessary to gain a large amount of weight, 18 pounds in a month without medical supervision and weekly blood tests is DANGEROUS. Just as dangerous as losing 18 pounds in a month with no Dietary professional to help. The true goal of body positivity and loving your body, is to prioritize giving it what it needs to function. It has turned into a very slippery slope of no one being able to show concern or encouragement for people who want to be healthy(no matter if that\u2019s losing/gaining weight or simply being more active). If you took the weight gain out of this particular situation, I could still see a dedicated personal trainer being concerned about the clients attitude towards their training. At the least the client and trainer don\u2019t seem to be on the same page, I think him expressing his frustration was understandable.", "Well if we are going to that direction; how do we even know, in what manner and tone did this trainer speak? OP is asking if she is AF, because she HERSELF feels uncomfortable with the situation. How do we know that she is not projecting, thinking that her trainer judge her weight gain, when it's pretty obvious SHE is unhappy with it too, but now OP wants someone to say 'it's alright'. Well trainer said it's not alright to put on that much weight in a month, so now she wants these words from Reddit. \n\nI agree with you with something else being at play. Maybe the original plan was too strict; however, loosing 8 pounds in 6months (even with muscle gain) is definitely not extreme.", "Impossible? Idk I think some people could easily eat that much in extra calories for a month. All it takes is to eat out for 2 meals a day. Or consume a bunch of empty calories in drinks. 5 lbs or maybe even 10 lbs tops is going to come off in 2 weeks if she sticks to the diet again. But she definitely fell off the wagon and gained 18 lbs over that month. Hey shit happens, but OP took no accountability and sounds like she just doesn't want to hear the harsh truth of the consequences of her actions. PT is wasting his time and she is wasting her money and time if she doesn't want to listen to the expert she hired. Judgemental prick is a bit harsh. 18 lbs in a month IS concerning. People die from being overweight. If she continues this way in 10 months she could theoretically be 180 lbs heavier. PTs are known to be pushers because losing weight takes a lot of willpower and he did not put her down and call her names or anything. Just pointed out that 18 lbs in a month is no fucking joke even though you seem to think it's nothing. Ask any doctor and they'd agree.", "18 pounds? 18 pounds! Wake up", "It is wasting his time. His job is to help op lose weight and become fitter and healthier, he is unable to fulfill his job requirements if op isn't willing to put the effort in to better themselves. The whole point of hiring a personal trainer is that they have knowledge you don't which will help you and they push you harder than you would ordinarily push yourself. What's the point in hiring one of you're going to ignore them?"]}
