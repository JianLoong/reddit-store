She's a freshman in college. Isabella has always been a bit on the chunkier side weight-wise, and during her senior year of high school, especially that 2nd half of the year, she put on a noticeable amount of weight.\n\nAt any rate, we get on campus and get to her dorm building. She comes out and she looks noticeably heavier than when we last saw her in August. I was just happy to see her, and, I think unlike my wife, I already factored in that there'd be the Freshman 15.\n\nWe chat a little bit and then we go back to the hotel. We no more than get in the room before my wife goes, \" Did you see her? My god, she must just be binging. Did you see her stomach? It's huge. Her butt, I dont know how she squeezed into those jeans. We have to say something.\"\n\nI told my wife to calm down, told her we won't going to say anything. My wife called that lazy parenting. I asked her if she was suggesting we take our daughter to dinner and say, \" Honey, we noticed you have a huge butt\"\n\nI tried to explain that this is just the Freshman 15. My wife rolls her eyes and goes, \" Well, she looks like she packed on 15 pounds in August, September, and October.\"\n\nI'd had it, told my wife she was being really shallow, sitting her ranting about her daughter's body.\n\nMy wife got upset and refused to come to dinner.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697122394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1768v0a/aita_for_calling_my_wife_shallow/", "score": 610, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because if your daughter is at an unhealthy weight, and if she put on a lot of extra weight in a short period of time, it wouldn't be unreasonable to talk to her about it.

I'm a 20-year-old college student who values the gym for its positive impact on well-being. I understand this topic can be sensitive because your wife's own self-criticism might influence her perspective on your daughter. Instead of focusing on aesthetic concerns, it's important to encourage positive motivation and reinforcement for change. Your protective stance can create a safe environment for your daughter, as low self-esteem can be debilitating.

This is undeniably terrible for her health, and also often a sign of underlying mental health concerns. \n\nFood addiction isn\u2019t talked about enough and binging is usually a tactic that has the same underlying justifications as alcohol or drugs. Temporary hits of serotonin to cover up underlying anxiety or depression. \n\nTelling your daughter \u201cyou\u2019ve gained weight\u201d will do nothing but cause insecurity and increase those underlying causes.

She needs your parenting, which at her age is much more like mentorship. \n\nYour wife probably has intuitive signals going off that something is obviously wrong, but she\u2019s only focusing on the effects and will most likely only address the effects. You should have a conversation with her first to make sure she understands your concerns.

She's a freshman in college. Isabella has always been a bit on the chunkier side weight-wise, and during her senior year of high school, especially that 2nd half of the year, she put on a noticeable amount of weight.\n\nAt any rate, we get on campus and get to her dorm building. She comes out and she looks noticeably heavier than when we last saw her in August. I was just happy to see her, and, I think unlike my wife, I already factored in that there'd be the Freshman 15.\n\nWe chat a little bit and then we go back to the hotel. We no more than get in the room before my wife goes, \" Did you see her? My god, she must just be binging. Did you see her stomach? It's huge. Her butt, I dont know how she squeezed into those jeans. We have to say something.\"\n\nI told my wife to calm down, told her we won't going to say anything. My wife called that lazy parenting. I asked her if she was suggesting we take our daughter to dinner and say, \" Honey, we noticed you have a huge butt\"\n\nI tried to explain that this is just the Freshman 15. My wife rolls her eyes and goes, \" Well, she looks like she packed on 15 pounds in August, September, and October.\"\n\nI'd had it, told my wife she was being really shallow, sitting her ranting about her daughter's body.\n\nMy wife got upset and refused to come to dinner.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. You're a good dad.  \nAs someone who has struggled with body issues, fluctuating weight, and obsessing about what others might think about me, I sympathize with your daughter. She may be going through a lot. What she needs is love & support from her parents, not to be fat-shamed. Guarantee, she's doing that to herself already.  \nKeep being a good dad!", "NTA\n\nHonestly hope your daughter doesn't go on reddit or sees this and put 2 n 2 together bc tbh MY self esteem took a hit at \n\"Well she must have added 15 August, September, October and November\" like fucking *ouch*. So mean, how would she feel if her daughter or you said that about her?", "NTA. As you said, your wife was not concerned about your daughter's health, she was only shocked by her repulsive (in her mind)  weight gain.", "NTA.  \n\nI think you are right to leave your daughter alone.  Love her, support her, but no need to criticize or point out that she's gained weight.  I'm not sure how far away school is from home, but not really a whole lot to do that is constructive.  If she's home over the summer, you could offer to do hikes or healthy activities with her.  Suggest taking a cooking class together to learn how to cook healthier foods... but I wouldn't frame any of those things because she needs them, but rather you want to do it and see if she'll do it with you.", "I mean I would\u2019ve responded with \u201cyeah I have a huge butt but at least I don\u2019t need to get surgery for one\u201d but that\u2019s just me. NTA btw", "NTA, but your wife has a valid point, just a crappy way of stating it. If your daughter really has put on 15 more lbs on top of her already being overweight, why?  Could something have happened to her? Is it simply stress from classes? If so, she needs to find a better outlet and this is something you all should be speaking about.", "NTA, no way. My mum did this to me after my first year of university, and our relationship / my self-esteem has never been the same.", "NTA, and I\u2019m so sorry your daughter has to grow up with that shit. I was criticized by my mom and all it gave me was a horrific eating disorder and a lifelong hatred of my body.", "NTA but this didn't just start and I guarantee part of your daughter's weight gain to be mental health issues and more specifically shitty things your wife has already said to her. The only thing you can do is be there for your daughter now, because the world will treat her like shit unless she gets sick and loses a lot of weight quickly or develops an ED. I'm speaking from experience at the very same age as your daughter. I'm healthy now thankfully but I spent many years unhealthy. Just ask some of the idiots on here, they'll tell you skinny is healthy no matter what. Your wife is probably of that stupid mentality and if you can't change her mind please choose your daughter so someone can help her mental state before it's too late.", "NTA For the most part but a big weight gain may indicate shes struggling a bit and thats coming from a bigger person. Maybe just make sure too ask how everythings going and if shes having trouble with anything. Might want too keep your wife away from that convo though if she can't keep her mouth shut.", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if all this time your wife\u2019s disdain for your daughter\u2019s size and beauty standards have affected your daughter. (Whether consciously or subconsciously). Healthy eating habits aren\u2019t born from being shamed and if your daughter actually is binge eating your wife ironically could\u2019ve instilled this in her.", "Nah fuck that your wife is totally being the asshole, why make your daughter feel worse about herself, I am sure your daughter has already noticed and knows about the weight gain.\n\nSounds like wifey needs to get over her own insecurities and not put them on your daughter.", "NTA\n\nShaming her will do NOTHING but make things worse. Your wife needs to lay off, and you were right for calling her shallow. You\u2019re a wonderful dad for standing up for your daughter.", "Hmmm...interesting one here. I'm not getting the shallow vibe truthfully. Unless she said something like, she will never find a boy looking like that or something similar. If your daughter has gain a significant amount of weight, your wife can definitely be concerned about her health or why she is gaining weight. Don't get me wrong, she could have voiced her concern differently. She was definitely being inconsiderate, but possibly her heart is in the right place...?", "My mother always made comments like that to me and then claimed it was \u2018for my health\u2019. You\u2019re in the right. Her weight will fluctuate her whole life esp in 19-30 as her body matures fully, don\u2019t let your wife breed resentment in her", "I'm going with ESH on this one (apart from your daughter). Unless there is some kind of underlying health issue (in which case tell me to STFU), her \"always\" being on the chunkier side seems to land squarely on the shoulders of the parents. The US (I'm assuming this is the US) is notorious for its incredibly unhealthy food supply and lack of education for youths. Therefore it's incredibly important for parents to teach their kids the importance of healthy diet and exercise and try to help keep them active. If she's always struggled with weight it sounds like maybe this was not happening. \n\nTo your point though your wife is being shallow but the conversation should be had and should center around her health, IMO. Freshman 15 is totally normal and plenty of people are saying it's easy to drop the weight later, which is accurate. But for some people, especially if they've never had much education or experience with it, it could start a really negative trend that sticks with her and affects her health in the long term. Especially if this already started in high school. Best of luck, I respect you for not trying to fat shame your daughter, but there is a balance between body positivity and completely disregarding basic dietary health.", "NTA in fact being a daughter that has a mother that's also very critical made me hate my boobs because I thought they weren't good enough and shame on my own mom. I never had a weight problem in my life until I got a bit older and had a hormonal imbalance and I noticed she would kind of get excited to pinch my fat or say something about my arms. My mom has been overweight her whole life and I just realize that she's very insecure with herself and will always be and that the shit she was doing to me is just because she doesn't like what she sees when she looks in the mirror. One time she was making fun of my boobs for no reason and my fiance said \"Well I fucking love how they look and her body.\" \n\nFunny thing is I've lost a considerable amount of weight now that I don't have my hormone problem and I have been enjoying going to the gym and always invite her to go but she never goes. All I know is your wife needs to take a good look at herself and think about her priorities because making fun of your daughter while she's trying to just make her way in the world isn't going to help.", "It\u2019s those type of comments from loved ones that spark a eating disorder. I mean imagine going up to you adult daughter. \u201c oh your bum is really big,look at your tummy \u201c\n\nAs a former fat kid those type of comments from close ones fucked me over . \n\nNTA you my good sir are a Fuckn legend", "NTA. The concern about one\u2019s child, I understand.

How is everything going?  Sleeping well? Staying hydrated?  Need a couple of new clothes?  Vitamins?  Healthy snacks for your room?  Do you have friends who support you? Any active hobbies?  I liked to walk / run / lift / swim as well as sing / journal / paint / whatever.\n\nAs your parent who loves you, I hope you have appropriate coping skills for stress. It is a big change being in charge of yourself. Managing your own schedule, sleep, nutrition, fitness etc. It\u2019s tempting to eat and drink and nap and neglect your health, but this choice is really hard to reverse.\u201d\n\nAlso, I see your wife used the word binging. If it\u2019s a case of BED, that\u2019s a mental health concern that needs support. Campus should have people who can help.

Whether she's happy, or if she's suffering any kind of depression. \nRegarding the weight. It's a slippery slope at college but a lot of people tend to go up and down depending on lifestyle and money. It's her first time away from home, so she's going to be eating a lot more rubbish than usual and that's normal.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who has considered cutting off my mother for her constant comments about my weight, your wife sounds like she is in danger of alienating your daughter.", "Nooooo", "NAH. She knows she's fat, but maybe she can change her diet if you guys talk to her now.", "ESH!\n\nYTA because you are just as shallow as your wife, you are just trying to hide it. You literally described your daughter as chunkier, putting on noticeable weight, and looking noticeably heavier even before you started talking about your wife.\n\nYes, your wife is an asshole as well. But you both need to sit down and have a talk with her about your concerns as adults. Calling names and belittling her on the internet isn't helping her. Perhaps she is having some depression? Perhaps you guys are thinking she is heavier than she actually is. \n\nWith parents like you two I can see why she might have depression -- and all those times you secretly talked about her weight in senior year of high school when you thought she wasn't around, she probably heard a lot of them.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who gained the less-popular \"freshman 50\", I can tell you at no point was I unaware of my weight gain. Your daughter knows she's gained weight, she doesn't need anyone to treat her like a dummy and point it out to her. Lazy parenting is saying all the dumb shit you're thinking because it'll make *you* feel better to get it off your chest. Your kid will come to you or your wife IF she ever wants to talk to you about it.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to he concerned over her weight because of health reasons.

Nothing needs or should be said about her weight or eating habits, just get a feel for if she\u2019s enjoying school, making friends, doing well in classes, or if she\u2019s feeling isolated, depressed, etc.  The first year of university can be a hard transition, and major weight changes can be a manifestation of depression and/or disordered eating. It\u2019s also entirely possible that your daughter is just learning how to balance life on her own with access to unlimited dining hall food and more stress than she\u2019s used to. Just keep lines of communication open and keep being a great dad!", "Nah. If she was gaining weight before she even left and she\u2019s heavier now, that\u2019s a problem. Between not eating well and not sleeping well as a freshman some is understandable. But this is where she needs to start learning to take care of herself completely.

That is crappy behavior as a mother, as is focusing on your daughter's stomach/butt instead of how she's adjusting to living on her own for the first time or dealing with school, etc. She doubled down when her husband tried to redirect her, do you honestly think she would have done a 180 and had a super health focused, concerned, polite convo with the daughter about it after? Discussing it with her husband was step one of the plan to harp, when she didn't get the ally she wanted she threw a hissy fit and refused to go to dinner at all. I guess if you can't berate your kid for gaining weight during dinner, why bother to go at all.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "I mean someone's health absolutely matters and college is where you begin to build habits that follow you through adulthood.", "Yes, you should.

Maybe someone's obesity is a side effect of another health issue they could not control. My point is that weight is one of the few visible health issues that people feel they have the ability to comment on with impunity.  Do you walk up to people in a bar and lecture them on the health issues that alcohol can cause? Or go up to people on the beach and lecture them on skin cancer? People do things all the time that have health consequences, for some reason overweight people are the only ones that society feels they have the right to lecture and concern themselves with. That is the point of the wheelchair analogy, not that it is a one to one comparison to being obese (which OP never said his daughter was, he used chunky and freshman 15, which leans more towards slightly overweight then obesity imo).\n\nPeople seem to think that being overweight is a moral failing instead of an issue that can have legitimate foundations in a variety of health issues, like thyroid issues or PCOS. Having underlying medical conditions can make it very hard, slow and frustrating to lose weight, and it can be a life long issue. So while it isn't something that people would classify as permanently disabled, it is a health issue that a lot of people deal with throughout the entire course of their life. Regardless, people's bodies are not your business to just give your opinion on, no one wants it. People know the body they are living in, so what gives someone else a right to comment on that body? \n\nObesity can definitely cause health issues, but the fact that OP refers to it as the freshman 15 makes me think that it is not obesity or a significant amount of weight gain that would cause those kinds of health issues and as you pointed out the mother is not concerned with her health, but her appearance.", "How often does telling a smoker they shouldn\u2019t smoke make them stop smoking?

I thought we were talking about a young woman who gained some weight? \n\nFirst of all, there is no cure for fatness. Some people are just fat. And I personally have no problem with that. But I think as a society the least we can do is not stigmatize fatness and treat fat people like shit. It\u2019s just one way that bodies are. So it is something we need to accept. Instead of treating an entire demographic of people like second class citizens.\n\nAnd body shaming isn\u2019t something that hurts people\u2019s feelings, though I love how you minimize the impact. It creates deep and long lasting trauma that results in fat people being less likely to seek medical help for health problems to accept being paid less than thin counterparts and to just generally buy into the narrative that you seem to be peddling that their bodies are unacceptable.", "Yeah she clearly needs to cool off before addressing that.

Everyone is different so for you, others confronting you in any shape might be a bad thing. Im just saying that for alot of people thats not really true. With obesity, we are often times talking about a behavioural issue. Its a bad habit thats very hard to change. You are obviously aware of these behvaiours but that doesnt mean you are able to change them without support. Drugs are an extreme example and arent 1 to 1 anaglogous but they are also habits that are hard to change. So they are the easiest thing to use here. People who use them are also obviously aware that they should not be doing it. But often times, that awareness alone is not enough. Because you on your own can come up with all kinds of excuses and justifications to continue the habit for a little longer before starting therapy or... you know, starting a diet.\n\nYOull probably still jump at my throat for this but i would die on this hill.
