And actually doing something he was enjoying?\n\nLike, I get it when people do \"nice\" things because they want to seem super awesome and it's just an exercise in narcissism. It's ok to ignore their efforts, if it's clearly manipulation.

The two are not not mutually exclusive and it\u2019s ridiculous to insist that they are. \n\nNo matter how you try and justify yourself not showing gratitude **is** ah behavior. Not showing an a ounce of gratitude for unexpected, unknown, acts of care, love and kindness, particularly from your SO, is a fantastic way to make sure nobody ever does anything for your or with you ever again.

I'll never understand why why women insist on dating men who have so much disdain for them.", "No you have no self respect. Because if you did you would have told him off in front of his \"friends\". You let him disrespect you and you DID NOTHING ABOUT IT!!! You just told him and showed him and his friends that you are a door mate.", "He treated you the way nobody should treat their partner.

Although, as much as I despised him for what he said and did, I didn\u2019t want to make a scene and ruin all of the guests\u2019 night. We were about 75 people.

I don't know how this is confusing. Like I get what you mean, sort of. He wouldn't have to, say, pay her back for the party.

It was very clear that the bf did in fact like what OP did for him. So it isn't a stretch to believe that he does in fact that owe her a big fucking thank you. He does like surprises. He did enjoy the party and stayed out all night. She knows this man better than you. So this insistent ranting on your part is just weird. He was also incredibly rude to her when he dismissed her in front of everyone. The only reason why he is embarrassed is because he knows he's an ah. \n\nOP dump that douchbag. You deserve better.", " I don't want to accuse him of cheating just because he's an asshole.", "No, you are not a doormat. You spoke up for yourself and when he ignored the completely reasonable request, you left. You didn\u2019t need to make a scene to have self respect. I do think you should break up with him over this, because pushing you and talking to you like that is way too much.", "NTA.  He was ungrateful, treated you like trash, and embarrassed himself.  What were you supposed to do, just stand there and take his abuse?  Why would you want to be around him when he's treating you like that?", "NTA, OP. At all. Him putting hands on you in *any* situation is a red flag but it takes a certain level of audacity to do it in front of other people. Get away.", "That's even worse that he put hands on you. Been done with this guy, please. He's not a safe person.", "Ok. Now I get it. Your not the ahole", "Not at all. Doing things because you know you should and not for the praise is actually a very calming thing. You don\u2019t get bent out of shape when someone doesn\u2019t give you the reaction you want.", "It\u2019s not, you want acknowledgement of the effort you put forward for own gratification.", "No you do nice things without expecting a thank you. I hold the door because it\u2019s polite not because I expect every person that comes in to tell me thanks. And I\u2019ll get the door on the way out for the same people that didn\u2019t say thanks the first time. It\u2019s not about doing it and getting celebrated it\u2019s about doing it because it\u2019s the polite thing to do.", "No but if you do something for me don\u2019t do it under the condition I have to be grateful, especially if you don\u2019t know if I want a party or not. I personally never want a surprise party, so if my GF threw one for me I would be upset not thankful.", "They should run it by me because I would never want a surprise party so if my GF throws one I know she didn\u2019t do it for me.", "I never said I was in the scenario. Through conversations and being called the OP\u2019s BF I made it known I wouldn\u2019t want a surprise party.", "It's the push that makes him the AH.", "Bold of you to think I need your belief", "I\u2019m not looking for that, I replied to another comment not the OP.  Im also not looking for anyone to validate anything, you were triggered by my take and felt like you had to say something to either change my mind or make sure I understood that you don\u2019t agree with me. And neither of those things matter to me. I\u2019m on the clock replying to y\u2019all so I have all the time in the world to go back and forth.", "This is all moot because my comment was a reply to another comment not the OP.", ">Doing things because you know you should and not for the praise is actually a very calming thing\n\nOP never did it for the praise.\n\nAnyone can do something **not** for the praise. But the moment they are completely blindsided, spoken to like shit in front of that persons friends, then argued with and disrespected invalidates the feelings you'd have, it would make you feel unwanted and not loved.\n\nSure you don't have to do it for the praise, but it doesn't take a lot to be thankful for someone going out of their way for you. Works both ways, both can be true!", "But- thats literally what a thank u does. It shows someone gratitude lol. Ur not forced to say thank you but it shows that you are grateful for whatever", "Yeah dude, no one is disagreeing with that. I do the same. But when it's done for me, I cannot imagine not saying thanks. Or if a friend gets me a surprise gift or something; why would you not express gratitude in their thoughtfulness? Like are you a robot? No one is entitled to a thank you, but like....it's so bewilderingly odd that you draw that line in the sand", "From what the OP has said, he was very excited once the party was in swing and he was evidently enjoying himself. So he\u2019s not like you in that regard.\nI wouldn\u2019t like a surprise party myself, but if someone did some manner of surprise that was thoughtful and that they worked hard on, I would thank them because it doesn\u2019t cost me anything to be baseline polite.", "No one was around to give you house training. Just say that.", "You're a sad excuse for a human", "..... You're far too invested in this scenario. Unless you're OP's boyfriend, I don't see how this line of commenting is relevant.", "Fair enough.\n\nBut I do have to ask, what the fuck does your personal feelings have to do with this post?\n\nLike sure, we all share our opinions, but yours is literally irrelevant as the point you're stuck on isn't even the point of the post. It's the cherry on top, who hurt you?", "Wasn't this Don's reaction during the plot of a Mad Men episode? Lol.", "LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL", "Yeah but you're here in the comments of a post about a specific scenario. You brought up a whole scenario that had nothing to do with the post or even truly the comment you were responding to. Just right off the rails with unrelated beef you have with, I dunno, the world?\n\nNow I know for sure you have no home training because, if you had some, you'd know that jumping to an off-topic personal issue in the middle of a discussion about something else entirely is rude. There is nothing in the comment you first responded to that reasonably gets us to you and your refusal to tell people \"thank you\", a thing most 4 year olds successfully do.", "Their remark was in regard to THIS post.", "My comment wasn\u2019t toward the OP it was a reply to someone else comment. I mean it\u2019s also polite to not walk into the middle of a conversation and expect your BF to stop talking to his friends and immediately see what you want.", "So let\u2019s use your friend buying you a gift as an example. If your friend buys you a shirt but it\u2019s something you\u2019d never wear you can say thanks but if your friend notices you never wear it and they start saying how much it cost and how big of a hassle it was to get, that\u2019s where I draw the line. On that same note, I would never be upset if I got someone something and they didn\u2019t care for it. I wouldn\u2019t remind them of the cost or tell them how many hoops I went through to get it.", "But if you\u2019re doing it with the expectation of being thanked and celebrated for doing it, your not doing it for the other person, you\u2019re doing it to feel good about yourself.", "Your mom was", "So why are you still here?", "Well you see is was replying to a comment Someone else made about him being ungrateful not the OP. So that answers that.", "Idk I\u2019ve never seen mad men.", "How did I do it in the middle of a discussion when\nMy first reply is me personally believing that you don\u2019t owe someone a thank you for doing something you didn\u2019t ask for?", "And mine was in regards to their post.", ">expect your BF to stop talking to his friends and immediately see what you want.\n\n Now now, lets not make up lies for self-validation. Lets tone that down a little shall we?\n\nOP said this:\n\n***After a while, I went to see him while he was with some college friends and asked him if he was having a good time.*** \n\nNow I gotta ask, where tf is that expectation for him to **stop** talking to his friends?\n\nAsking \"You having a good time\" is now expecting someone to stop talking. You heard it first here folks.\n\nNot sure what post you're reading but I can promise you it's not the same fecking one", "You saying thanks doesn't mean that it's ok for your friend to guilt trip you for not wearing it. They would be the asshole in that situation", "Bro your running in circles to explain that you're just a rude prick. Everyone gets it \" your edgy and ungrateful and like people just need to get over themselves looking for my thanks\" as if you're someone anyone wants to do anything for. SMH edgy redditors", "I thought the whole reason that the OP left the party in the first place was that he was rude to her in front of his friends, and that the not being thanked part was just the icing on the cake, no pun intended.", "You have poor reading comprehension as well.", "Lol, what a sad life you must have", "She would have done a much better job. Cheers!", "Found the boyfriends burner account", "I'm in a waiting room with nothing else to entertain me.", "Well you're wrong anyway.\n\nOriginal comment starts with this:\n\n**Any party you go to, it's customary to thank the host.**\n\nDefinition of Customary:\n\n***according to the customs or usual practices associated with a particular society, place, or set of circumstances.***\n\nYou piped up with this:\n\n***I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t owe anyone a thanks for a party I didn\u2019t ask for.

The comment you were replying to is right, it IS customary. It's also respectful in a relationship to appreciate things your partner does for you. It's normal, it's part of **loving** relationships.
