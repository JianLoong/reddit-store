I work closely with this colleague on a daily basis as our jobs are heavily intertwined, so to me being asked to grab a bite as a send off did not seem that notable. \n\nWe went out and grabbed a sandwich. She drove. The usual (so I thought)\n\nMy wife when I mentioned it believed it was highly inappropriate. Called it a date. Asked why I\u2019m spending time with another women. Says no matter what one of you wants to sleep with the other, and she hopes it\u2019s not me and that I am in denial. \n\nI said to her I think it is perfectly normal that I was asked to grab a bite as a send off and it is perfectly normal practice. She says it is not the social norm and inappropriate for married people. \n\nI brought up that at my future job that I will begin shortly I was already told by my future colleague she will be taking me out to lunch on the first day (also a female around my age) and asked my wife if that\u2019s also inappropriate, which she says yes if you are by yourselves, drive together, eat alone. I made it clear I believe it is completely normal practice and she doesn\u2019t understand what professional relationships are. To which she told me I clearly don\u2019t understand marriage. \n\nAITA: for thinking grabbing lunch with a colleague of the opposite sex is professional and normal?\n\nAdded info after post:\n- No previous infidelity \n- It came up after the fact, the request happened quick so it was a sure let\u2019s go, it was mentioned after when it came up in text.
