I work closely with this colleague on a daily basis as our jobs are heavily intertwined, so to me being asked to grab a bite as a send off did not seem that notable. \n\nWe went out and grabbed a sandwich. She drove. The usual (so I thought)\n\nMy wife when I mentioned it believed it was highly inappropriate. Called it a date. Asked why I\u2019m spending time with another women. Says no matter what one of you wants to sleep with the other, and she hopes it\u2019s not me and that I am in denial. \n\nI said to her I think it is perfectly normal that I was asked to grab a bite as a send off and it is perfectly normal practice. She says it is not the social norm and inappropriate for married people. \n\nI brought up that at my future job that I will begin shortly I was already told by my future colleague she will be taking me out to lunch on the first day (also a female around my age) and asked my wife if that\u2019s also inappropriate, which she says yes if you are by yourselves, drive together, eat alone. I made it clear I believe it is completely normal practice and she doesn\u2019t understand what professional relationships are. To which she told me I clearly don\u2019t understand marriage. \n\nAITA: for thinking grabbing lunch with a colleague of the opposite sex is professional and normal?\n\nAdded info after post:\n- No previous infidelity \n- It came up after the fact, the request happened quick so it was a sure let\u2019s go, it was mentioned after when it came up in text.

It just lessens your risk of being accused of something down the road. The better you know someone the less risk there is usually in this area of course but just some food for thought.

Both my husband & I got a good laugh from it. My husband said, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you have a work husband. You should definitely have a work husband if he brings you records!\u201d", "Don\u2019t forget the afternoon Turkish delight", "If one spouse says the other cannot interact with colleagues of one gender the same way they act with colleagues of another gender, that is a workplace discrimination problem. Professional lunches are part of workplace development, and when women are excluded from those activities they lose opportunities. \n\nAnd what if the OP\u2019s wife decides he shouldn\u2019t have meetings with female colleagues? Especially if he is a senior employee or is in a supervisory role, that becomes a huge problem for the women he works with. Or if he is junior and cannot work with senior women in his office, he may also suffer professionally. \n\nI know marriage counselors bring different philosophies to their work but the fact that you say the OP is the AH from here on out if he goes to another lunch with a female colleague seems deeply problematic to me.", "Thank you for this well explained answer! Really appreciate it!", "Literally the only time my husband has ever shown even a SCRAP of jealousy was at a medieval fair when a knight in the joust came over to flirt with me in character as part of his act. I laughed and told him I was married and hubs came up and playfully challenged him to a duel \ud83e\udd23"]}
