My mom told me when she saw they kissing one time that he drove her home after a party. To say that I was sad is an understatement. I was heartbroken. I couldn't look at his face or my sister's. I didn't said to my mother-in-law why we separated because I thought that this was his responsibility, but I've been receiving tons of calls from her asking if I'm ok and saying that she misses me.

Hopefully doing these new things you'll meet girls who will become such good friends you'll have a proper sister relationship with them, one you deserve.

You ccan date someone's past fling without automatically assuming that both will be garbage people that cheat behind your back", "I can not parse where you think I said they were garage people. \n\nMy point was you should never marry anyone your sister slept with and she called it a fling what exactly does that mean were they just friends with benefits or dating. She never explained. \n\nAnd I feel that once you sleep with someone there is a possibility you may do it again due to familiarity. And under the right circumstances any thing can happen AND IT DID. \n\nAnd let\u2019s do some math here  \n\nOP Has know him for 3 years Sister is 22 hubby is 31. \n\nSo let\u2019s say 3 years ago sister was 19 and hubby was 29.  So why is a 29 year old dating a 19 year old \n\nSo OP Dated him right after their fling. \nOr Was it a year before the fling when sister was only 18. \n\nEither way the whole thing was a bunch of red flags \ud83d\udea9"]}
