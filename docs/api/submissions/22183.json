Did they expect you to lie to her?  Why shouldn't she know what an AH her son is?  You've done nothing wrong.  MIL wanted to know your reasons & you told her the truth.  Lying here to save her from hurting would've been wrong.  I hope you are still able to have some relationship with your MIL as it seems you truly care about eachother.  I'm sorry your sister is such an AH.  I wish you well.", "NTA and kudos to your mom for watching your back", "NTA\nSorry you\u2019re going through this, has your sister offered any type of apology, or regret?

He doesn't tell his mother why. You do, before she hears it from others not immediately involved, and it's all your fault.\n\nThat's some next level gaslighting of his mother by your ex & his brothers & friends.", "NTA- She was going to find out eventually and it's better that you told her rather than your mom.", "NTA 10000%.

What they did was horrible and they need to face the consequence for their actions. Its time to move on. You are not responsible for the familial fallout concerning your sister and ex.

You deserve better - please keep that in mind.", "NTA\n\nAdults can be held accountable to their own actions and if there are repercussions -- THOSE ARE THEIR OWN DOING. And nobody else's fault at ALL.", "NTA. With that age gap and her having been 18 when she met him, I think he was possibly grooming her. Regardless, it's disgusting. He's a creep. I don't necessarily blame her for this though, not without knowing more about the situation with them.\n\nWhen I was a freshman in college, I also got involved with a guy that much older than me. I didn't see how much of a creep he was until later. When you're in the situation that I was in, you aren't given room to see clearly. It's confusing. So I will withhold my judgement on the sister without knowing if she was in a similar boat or not.", "NTA I hope you go NC with your sister. She cheated with your ex husband.\n\nShe deserves all treatment she gets.", "You are not the a-hole", "That's assuming the sister even wants to date him.

Her son/ OP\u2019s husband is just as much at fault.", "I hesitate to call the sister an AH because of the age gap.

Your sister deserve each other\u2026 and YOU deserve so much better!", "I thought the same thing. Sis & ex probably won't keep dating now.  She was their cover so people didn't call him out for being a creep.

It IS now mine to tell because of the position the liars have put me in.", "Never understand siblings that do this. Incest by proxy.", "So it is MIL\"s fault.  I don't think so.

Men have always been going for younger women because they're easy to manipulate and there will always be cheaters. \n\nPersonally, my single mom raised me and my 4 brothers to be extremely respectful to women and yet one of them is in jail for fucking a 16 year old and one is a homophobic, transphobic asshole despite me being trans and gay.  These were things she was vehemently against our entire lives and yet they're doing it anyway. \n\nMy mom isn't at fault for that. That grown man made a choice as an adult and his mom had no idea what he was doing. If these were choices he made as a child and continued to do throughout that childhood, sure. You could say she raised him like that.
