None of you are obligated to make any significant changes in lifestyle to accommodate him. It's enough they get a rent free place to live - they should be grateful, not feel entitled to demand you change things to suit them. Jay doesn't like the hospitality? Jay is welcome to go rent a dog-free place and do as they like.
