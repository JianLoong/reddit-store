Jay is welcome to go rent a dog-free place and do as they like.

The stress of losing their families and homes is insane! It is like moving to another country where you don\u2019t know the language! Thank you for not even considering it!", "NTA, you are already doing Jay a favor. They don't get to make demands or make an existing resident homeless just because.", "It\u2019s not enough we cater to their \u201cpreferred pronouns\u201d? This world is too woke and the herd needs thinning.", "NTA. It might be time to drop Jay off at mil's house.", "NTA Jay is a temporary guest toto lives there if Jay isn't comfortable they can go elsewhere", "Fuck Jay.\n\nNTA.  I wouldn't get rid of my pets for anyone.", "NTA, and it sounds like it's time to revoke Jay's house guest status. Someone who wants you to get rid of your dog for bizarre reasons is not a safe person to have alone with your dog in your house.", "NTA and it sounds like Jay needs to go stay with MIL. Your dog will not be safe otherwise. I can't imagine the gall of trying to dictate that sort of thing, or backing it up, in the case of the MIL.", "NTA. Jay should go be comfortable at MILs if she feels that strongly. You've been very generous in welcoming them to your home, but it is still your home, and your dog lives there.", "NTA. Jay needs therapy", "NTA. You would be TA is you got rid of your dog. You\u2019re the dog\u2019s family and he has bonded with you. You have an obligation to keep your dog. Jay is your guest and an adult, supposedly able to care for themself. If they aren\u2019t happy in your home, they can go live elsewhere.", "NTA. Dog was their first and he\u2019s your companion. You are doing Jay a favor and they should be grateful. I\u2019m not huge on dogs but if I\u2019m staying somewhere rent I\u2019d get over it and also I hang out with some peoples dogs when I go to their house. If MIL is worried she can take them in.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t see how coming out as trans and what they\u2019re going through has anything to do with a dog.", "NTA someone needs to go and that someone\u2019s name is Jay.", "> society producing\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN\n\nNTA, btw", "NTA. If a guest came into MY house and told me to get rid of my dog, cat, goldfish, whatever- I'd show them where the door is.", "They, not he", "How do you know?", "Yeah. Then how is it misgendering? The gender isn't mentioned. So everyone's just using the generic forms as per the rules of grammar. What's wrong with that?", "I don't, just as we don't know if they identify as he or she. Therefore I'll use they such as used in the post.", "In what world staying in other people's houses and telling them \"Hey thank you for taking me in btw could you get rid of your dog so my temporal staying is more pleasurable?\" \nNTA", "there's not a person in the world i wouldn't drop if they wanted me to get rid of my pets", "Nope nope nope. When someone moves into your already established household (children/pets/roommates/etc) they already know the situation and agreed to stay there. When they decide it doesn't work for them,  they are the ones who need to make new arrangements and gtfo!! Do not change shit just for them. Why???", "NTA, Jay is. You really have to ask? If a guest in my home said such a thing they would be out on their ass right quick.", "I\u2019m suspicious of the reality of this story.  Apologies to OP if it is real, reality can be stranger than fiction, but this reads very much like something a certain sort of troll would put together just to see what happens when \u2018the libs\u2019 have to choose between two situations that, on their own, would usually result in overwhelming support for one side of the argument.", "NTA\n\nYour husband told him the exact same thing that was going through my mind.\n\nYou do not ask to stay with someone and then start demanding they get rid of their pets. The sheer vanity and entitlement of Jay is laughable. Tell MIL Jay can come live with her and she can give into their demands.", "Nta...doesn't matter how Jay identifies; they are a jerk for insisting that the dog has to go. They sound like a serious pain in the posterior. Keep a close eye on your dog until Jay is out; I would not put it past them to arrange for a way for the dog to be out of the picture.", "NTA. You don\u2019t go crash on someone\u2019s couch then insult their kindness by insisting they get rid of their pet. Not sure what world he lives in-but it\u2019s not reality.", "NTA: HE (JAY) - is the a-hole here.  HE can go live wherever HE feels HE is comfortable.  Vote me down - but the \"trans\" entitlement card is bullshit.", "NTA.  I\u2019d be worried Jay being around the poor dog after that.  Jay needs to leave.  They\u2019ve blown it, and don\u2019t deserve any more chances.", "NTA. This is so obvious I don\u2019t even think it needs an explanation", "NTA. My house, My dog, and My rules. Jay can go stay with MIL since she wants to get involved. Make sure the doors stay closed till he's gone. Pets tend to get lost when people have an issue. NOT Jay's forever home.  Furry and four-legged rule.", "NTA being trans doesnt stop people from being selfish entitled ah's", "Tell Jay/he/they/whateverhewantstobecalled to go back to mommy\u2019s place because the dog is family and not going anywhere", "NTA.  The dog was there before Jay and Jay can go find another place to live.", "Nta\n\nJay's an dult on their bike if they don't t like the free accommodation.  'Get rid of your dog'.  Jay would have been down the pound within an hour of saying that in my house. Cheeky fekker", "NTA. The audacity \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, Jay needs therapy", "NTA\n\nMiL can rehouse Jay if she's so upset over this. Your dog does not want or need rehousing.", "NTA\n\nI dont know what having a dog has anything to do with their life as Trans and why their views are something that you have to enforce in your home that you are graciously allowing them to stay in.\n\nHate to break it to them too but we all live in a society whether they like it or not.\n\nSounds pretty immature to me and I'm glad you refused to get rid of your dog.  They live there, your guest does not.  They can simply get up and walk out the door if they don't like it.", "He can be whatever he/she/they don't care.. But he doesn't have a say IN YOUR HOUSE. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.  I would have to be incapable of caring for my dog before I would even consider rehoming her.  I'd happily lose my house, my car, pretty much everything if that is what I had to do to keep my dog.  A dog is a lifelong commitment unless extreme circumstances exist, such as an owner being diagnosed with a terminal illness or an owner losing mobility or some other extreme circumstance.  A guest living in your home is not one of those circumstances.  \n\nAnd aside from the commitment you made in adopting Toto, I'm assuming you love him dearly.  I believe the gain this person may feel by you rehoming Toto is not greater than the pain and loss you will feel from losing him.  If you're getting rid of any family members, it should be the person and not Toto.  This person knows a life without you, Toto does not and Toto relies on you for every single one of his needs and desires.", "Why is it that \u201cguest\u201d feel like they can tell you how to govern your house! So what are you to do with Toto? How long does Jay plan on staying would be the bigger question? When you don\u2019t agree with Jay you are now transphobic and will be enemy #1 and all your husband\u2019s family will dislike you\u2026..", "NTA Jay should go regardless.", "Agree NTA - but are you reading the same post?  Jay came out trans and everything fell to pieces leading to this dog post.  Trans declaration has everything to do with Jay falling apart.  Jay can leave if it make HIM anxious.", "I usual think that human needs suppress animals/pets; But this is just ridiculous.\n\nA house guest that wants to get rid of a dog that not even at the house most of the day, that just bald  \n\nNTA", "The trans thing is more of an identity factor than anything financially disrupting (quitting your job, divorcing). I really don\u2019t give a single shit what pronouns people want to use to refer to themselves. With that said, it\u2019s not OPs responsibility to accommodate Jay for Jays mental state just because Jay is feeling a type of way over transitioning. Going trans is a personal choice, and it should not become OPs burden, ESPECIALLY if it means giving up an adorable little yorki which is family.", "Did op say somewhere that Jay is him? I'm looking at the post and it never uses any pronouns, I was trying to figure that out", "Devils advocate, but does it? Jay had the audacity to demand OP get rid of their dog for him and his *temporary* living situation.  Thats not from his life falling apart, thats from being selfish. Also, the way it is written we dont know if Jay voluntarily left their job or not since it just says \"left\". So potentially had the means to support themselves for a while and chose not too. Or at least attempt to save up money to support themselves.", "And I would warn Jay that if ANYTHING happens to this dog, you will adopt a pair of needy, anxious rescues, perhaps a pit or a Doberman or a Great Dane or a Belgian malamute.  Make sure he knows you\u2019re serious AF.  NTA.  Frankly I\u2019d make it known that you fear for the dog with his attitude and want them out\u2026they\u2019re 34, time to be a grownup.", "I agree. Trans or non trans Jay just sounds like high maintenance from the getgo.", "Because they want proof they are the most important person in the house. I have always had pets, usually several cats and a dog or two,  and the number of relatives who will tell me of their dislike of animals is amazing. Even more amazing, is their announcement that they are coming to stay for a couple  of days/weeks and the expectation that the pets will just disappear.", "YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THEY ARE GOING THROUGH!!!!", "if someone \"comes out\" as trans, 90% of cases will just be someone with some mental health issue screaming for help.\n\nthey come with an emotional baggage. dont expect logic to work against them.", "NTA - Jay needs to go.", "NTA.

Tell Jay to fuck right off.", "NTA \n\nSounds like he needs a lot of growing up to do.

No, your dog was there before him. The dog is family. He can stay with the dog or leave.", "Pack his bags for him. He can find an animal free place to live.", "NTA. The guy named Jay can move.", "Whoa. NTA at all.", "NTA.  Kick him out of your home, this is stupid and awful.", "What does \"society producing\" even mean?
