My little brother has always been a spoiled brat. My parents have always went easy on him, and they always say \u201cboys will be boys\u201d to excuse his bad behavior. He has a record of getting in trouble at school, throwing frequent tantrums (even at the age of 16), and completely trashing the house. Once, my mom tried to show him what it\u2019s like to live in filth with no one picking up after him, and he seemed perfectly fine with the mess. Since then, neither my mom or my dad have tried much with him, but they still dote on him.\n\nNow for the story. I\u2019ve never been able to date much since everyone in school knew my brother, and they didn\u2019t want to get caught in crossfire. I have finally found the sweetest boyfriend in my senior year, but I never brought him up with my family until graduation. They met him briefly at the ceremony, but they demanded I bring him home for a proper introduction at dinner. I brought up the idea with my boyfriend, and he was fine with it.\n\nWhen he got over, immediately, my little brother started being nasty to him. My boyfriend usually brushed it off as jokes, but I could tell he was getting more and more  uncomfortable. The final straw was when my little brother commented on his weight and said we were \u201cperfect for each other.\u201d I looked to my parents to do something, but they just grimaced. I stormed out of the house with my boyfriend, and apologized for my little brother. He left.\n\nWhen I came back inside, my brother couldn\u2019t stop laughing. Neither of my parents were doing anything. They apologized to me, but they didn\u2019t reprimand my little brother. I was so sick of his behavior, and of my parents\u2019 behavior too. I think I went on a thirty-minute screaming tangent, calling him all sorts of things. My family is very religious, so I definitely crossed a line when I called him the \u201cantichrist.\u201d He didn\u2019t throw a tantrum like usual. He just sat there in stunned silence and went into his room.\n\nThen, my dad started yelling at me, saying I couldn\u2019t be so awful to my little brother, and that it was \u201cevil\u201d of me to call him the names that I called him (other things along the lines of \u201cantichrist.\u201d) My mom stayed quiet. Dad went on to say that it \u201cwasn\u2019t my job to parent him.\u201d So am I in the wrong here? Should I have just let it go? My boyfriend is fine after the whole thing, but we can both agree I won\u2019t invite him over for dinner after that fiasco.

And keep calling him the antichrist.", "NTA - get out asap friend", "NTA - While you may have been reactive, you sat there and watched your parents do nothing as your little brother, who is old enough to know when he's behaving poorly, berate your bf for his appearance. Definitely understandable that you would stand up for your bf and also let the floodgates open a bit. You've also had to watch your brother get special treatment and no reprimands for his whole life, which is highly unfair.  I would have had a hard time not unloading on my parents if I were in your shoes. They need to be parents to BOTH of their kids.", "NTA Just keep calling him the antichrist in front of their  friends till they address the issue", "NTA You have the right to defend yourself and inform your brother of how his actions are affecting you. It was probably a much needed awakening for him and he obviously wasn't going to get it from your parents. If you went a bit overboard with your language while expressing yourself, you can apologize, but it's understandable because it seems you haven't been allowed to practice that skill. Does your family's religion exclude basic respect and decency toward all family members? It sounds like the religion is very strong about supporting traditional gender roles. Within that construct, respect and appreciation for the other genders part in family life and society is also supposed to be important. If that aspect is being glossed over, it's time for a more thought out frequent reminder to the rest of the family.", "Wait, so your parents think that corrections only come from parents?

Get the hell outta there and go NC with them. He's gonna be a real PITA to anyone he encounters, and better make sure to tell any mutual people who are potentially gonna have contact with your brother to not associate you with him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
