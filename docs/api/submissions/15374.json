She is not someone I'd want in my life. I mean who behaves this way? Also a friend doesn't flirt with their freind's partner.", "NTA. This is the definition play stupid games win stupid prizes. She played a game, now she gets to deal with the prize.", "Adults play spin the bottle?", "NTA. She embarrassed herself. \n\nAlso, same question as another comment but... What the actual fuck was her end-game here? What did she think would happen? Did she think that *magically* she would actually end up engaged to Josh?

That is exactly what happened.", "Uh. Hm. NAH in my opinion. \n\nI'm pretty sure Luna and her friend were joking. Like even when the posted it on SM, I can see how that would be kind of funny. In a joking haha way. \n\nAt the same time, I don't think you did anything wrong? You may e came off stern and kinda rude with how you phrased it, but it wasn't like a social faux pas to clarify that it was just for a dare. \n\nI mean at the end of the day, you, your friends, and your bf know that Luna didn't get engaged to Josh.
