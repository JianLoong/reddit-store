He'd be singing a different tune if he was the one who just gave birth.  You're at a critical time in your life where you're both healing and trying to care for a newborn.  You can't pile anything else on there.  It wouldn't be unreasonable for you to ask the in-laws to wait, especially since it's not like they'll lose out on hotel fees.\n\nI hope you heal quickly and thrive in the future. It's hard now, but it'll get better. The future for you is really bright.", "NTA. It honestly blows my mind when families think it's appropriate to stay immediately after their kids have given birth. Unless they have any intention of putting themselves to work whilst they visit they really should stay away. Your husband needs to start listening to you and if you're unable to persuade him then he needs to understand that there will be expectations made of them. They're not guests. They will be pitching in with the housework whilst they're staying.\n\nETA: it is true that OP extended the invitation and not necessarily that the in-laws are overstepping. Regardless, the invitation was extended prior to the circumstances changing and, in light of OP's difficulties, I still think it's fair to expect the in-laws to help out if they do wind up staying. With the husband taking on any and all 'hosting' duties. To be honest, I'd expect this of anyone staying overnight immediately after their family had just had a baby.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYou are recovering from birth and trying to take care of a newborn.  This is not the time to have to host visitors of any kind.  And as much as they can pretend that they won't be a problem - the possibility of you having them expect you to cater to them in some way is too great.\n\nThey stay at a hotel or no visit.", "NTA. Call them yourself and let them know you are in NO CONDITION to host. Let them know upfront that your home is not going to be ready for guests. Also tell them your husband will be responsible for all meals, transportation and entertainment. You have extremely limited mobility and will not be out of bed long enough to be a good hostess. Make sure you are firm with your tone and none of what you\u2019re saying is negotiable. Then follow through with this plan. DO NOT COOK, CLEAN OR ATTEMPT TO HELP YOUR HUSBAND WITH ANYTHING EXCEPT YOUR BABY.", "NTA \n\nIf you are not up to visitors, prepare the bedroom with water and snacks. You and baby can and should be resting as much as possible anyways. DH can host his parents and do all the chores. \n\nDo not be afraid to demand baby back.", "NTA. When your husband is only 1 week out from a traumatic birth and emergency c section, he can decide who is allowed to visit and stay overnight.", "NTA, it\u2019s very reasonable and fair request after a major surgery. If your husband doesn\u2019t relent, stay in your room with your baby to recuperate and get your husband to run errands around the house for you. You need to rest and recover.", "NTA. I wonder if your husband wants them there so they can take over some of the responsibilities I assume he's doing at the moment (like cooking, cleaning, shopping, some baby care). Option 2 is you say nothing and the visit goes as planned: they come all happy and you're crying, bleeding and shuffling with your boob out around the house. That's real parenthood for ya.", "NTA \n\nAfter you invited them, you realized that you were in no state to have houseguests. You did not cancel the whole thing (which would also have been acceptable, you are recovering from major surgery and you have a newborn!!) and offered to arrange a hotel. \n\nHusband is an Ass. HOOOOOOLLLLLEEEEE for not supporting you", "Definitely NTA.\n\nIs your husband reluctant to recant the invite to stay with you because he\u2019s afraid of their reaction perhaps?", "NTA. This is a vulnerable time for you right now and holding your self together for visitors for a few hours will be hard enough doing it for a whole week is impossible. Be clear with your husband how vulnerable you feel right now that you need his help doing X Y Z you cannot help him with any hosting duties. Perhaps have a similar conversation with your in-laws too.", "NTA. \n\nIf it was him recovering from a major surgery (which a C section is), he wouldn\u2019t want to be entertaining your parents in his home either. \n\nLet your husband know it\u2019s either hotel now or no visit until you\u2019re ready to entertain again.", "NTA. You didn't know how difficult the birth will be and you are still recovering from the surgery. You are entirely correct to want to have your space and I am surprised your husband doesn't have your back on this. Maybe talk to your MIL to make sure they won't be offended, she should be able to relate, right?", "NTA. You're literally offering to pay. It's not like they'd be out of pocket. \n\nPostpartum hormones are crazy, even without the trauma you've just experienced. Your husband doesn't understand how much trouble you're in right now. If he does intend to die on this hill (and I hope he doesn't) he needs to understand that 100% of the hosting responsibilities will fall to him. No exceptions.", "NTA. You know what you are capable of right now- and not knowing this beforehand is entirely reasonable- especially when you made the arrangement before going through actual, honest to god, life threatening trauma. \n\nThis is a hill worth (figuratively only, please) dying on.\n\nYour SO needs to shine his spine and back you up.", "Offer to kick your husband in the balls every hour for the entire visit so he understands the pain you are in and you get to suffer together.", "NTA. Your husband should definitely be listening to your needs right now more than ever- Slightly concerning that he isn't. I guess the only other alternative is you staying in a hotel? You definitely shouldn't have to, but it's an alternative to putting up with your inlaws 24hrs a day", "Absolutely NTA\n\nHubby needs to understand you just had the baby, and need to have a safe and comfortable feeling to recover in your own home.", "NTA, you're recovering from a C-section and still offering to pay for their hotel, there's nothing at all unreasonable about what you're asking.", "NTA and tell your husband that until his abdomen is sliced open and something the size of a watermelon is removed that he doesn\u2019t get an opinion on what the needs are to heal from that. Tell your in laws yourself, if they\u2019re reasonable people I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll understand. Your husband needs to get it together and start supporting you", "NTA. Ask your husband if he would like to have people staying over when he is bleeding, crying and in constant pain and agony. Ask him what the advantages are for him to die on this hill and if they outweigh the disadvantages for you. \n\nGuests in your house are a two yes situation even without a newborn baby and an exhausted postpartum mother. Ask him why his yes trumps your no and ask yourself if this is a pattern.", "NTA. You just grew and delivered a baby, with surgery. Your comfort absolutely trumps that of his parents. Also, regardless of where they sleep at night, don\u2019t feel like you need to host them or do any chores. If you want to be alone in your room with your baby, you do that. Your husband should be doing all the work here.", "OP it's a shame more public education is not done on postpartum care, i.e. recommendations on how long parents need to take before hosting outside visitors, wellness care for mothers immediately following birth and several months afterwards, learning to deal with the change in lifestyle instead of just sending them out the door.  Try to find some type of support to help you through this because you're definitely not alone and don't feel you have to do this on your own.  Keep yourself first because otherwise you're not going to be able to take care of your child if you're not 100%.", "Nooo your not at all, they should 1000% stay in a hotel. Just for future kids if you have them give yourself a break after you have had a child it\u2019s a lot on your body.. take time to look after you and bond with you baby", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA \n\nTell him if he insists on them staying you will be doing nothing, you are not hosting them, either he will have to take care of them or they will have to fend for themselves, the emergency c section changes things, if they aren\u2019t happy with this they can stay in a hotel or not come. If you have a good relationship with mil could you call her.", "NTA. This is your first baby, right? I understand wanting to share the excitement of a newborn with family, but it's difficult to anticipate how you might feel afterwards, especially when it's your first. You are DEFINITELY not in a position to host right now, even if you had to do nothing but care for baby. It can be a vulnerable time and a lack of compassion now from your husband can have a lasting effect. He needs to fully understand how you feel, and then ask them to go to a hotel or postpone for a few weeks. \nAlso, an emergency CS is a traumatic experience, so when you're ready, I'd recommend you see a psychologist for EMDR therapy. The first few weeks pf parenting are disorientating, but soon enough, a routine settles in and you gradually feel more human in time.", "NTA. In-laws aren\u2019t TA either because they were invited. I think a hotel is a good idea.", "NTA it\u2019s all fine your husband telling them they can stay when he isn\u2019t the one recovering. You can have as much time as you need without people staying in your house. If you can maybe get in touch with them and explain to them how you feel that you are in no condition for people to be staying at your house and how you will pay for a hotel", "NTA. He can get a say in how to host visitors when he is one week out from major abdominal surgery where his intestines have been pulled apart in order to bring a human being into this world. He can get a say when he is the one to experience extreme hormonal fluctations due to pregnancy and childbirth. \n\nPlease have him explain why he thinks you are \"unreasonable\" and \"unfair\". Ask him whose needs are more important? The needs of the people who didn't go through childbirth and surgery or the needs of the one person who did?", "NTA. You're in our survival mode AND you're recovering from major surgery and a traumatic event. Do what you need to do to feel comfortable. \n\nI remember around 4 weeks my MIL came to stay and I nervously asked if FIL could not come because my boobs were out all the time and I didn't want to have to relegate myself to a room in my house. They totally understood!\n\nAt 4 weeks having her there was helpful. The only person I felt comfortable with in my own home directly PP was my own mother. \n\nYour life just changed overnight, in the hardest way possible for the change to occur. Everyone should be understanding of that.", "NTA. You obviously were willing to have them stay originally so it\u2019s not about them or hosting. The circumstances have changed and you are physically not ready to have others in your home. You are recovering from a serious medical injury and trauma. That you got a precious baby from the experience does not change the physical damage to you. Ask your husband if he had his gut cut open, was oozing from multiple orifices, in pain and  his drugs weren\u2019t yet regulated (analogy for hormones) whether he thinks he could have guests staying with them. Any answer other than \u201cno\u201d means he has no empathy or clue what you\u2019re going through. Feel better soon!", "Based on the title: absolutely NTA\n\nAfter reading: absolutely NTA\n\nAfter seeing your comment in justnomil: DO NOT BUDGE! Can you leave to stay somewhere else with the baby if your husband continues to be TA?", "NAH. I can see both sides. It\u2019s rude to change plans last minute and not allow his parents to stay with you after saying yes, especially if they have to travel. On the other hand, I\u2019m assuming this is your first and you were unaware of the postpartum pain or possibly weren\u2019t expecting a c section so the plans have changed. Considering (assuming) his mother has gone through childbirth, she should have been more realistic with actually visiting one week postpartum. If you and your husband are covering the hotel costs, then it absolutely wouldn\u2019t be rude to insist they stay there, especially 1 week postpartum.", "NTA\n\nThis really fucking pisses me off. Your husband should be bending over backwards to make you comfortable after what you just went through. I would call off the visit altogether and have them try again in a few weeks. All you need to worry about is taking care of your baby and recovering.", "NTA.\n\nThis one is tricky as I can see where you are coming from... But at the same time, this is very last minute notice to change plans. I have no experience with this as I have never had a baby, but if it were hypothetically to happen, I would not want to put my mother up in a hotel. It would not sit well with me.\n\nI do not feel you are being an asshole, however. It is just some poor planning, I assume. Not that I blame you. I would not have realized there was a grace period to such a thing intrinsically.", "NTA. It\u2019s difficult when you have your first child. However, think about whether, if you do this, it will affect your future relationship with your in laws adversely.  Also, even if they\u2019re in a hotel, they will be spending the bulk of the day with you, and I assume you don\u2019t want to entertain them daily. The reality is, you should be sleeping during the day when your baby is sleeping.  I had trouble even finding time to shower the first few weeks with my first, but she wasn\u2019t an easy baby.   I hope your husband is home when they visit. Perhaps your MIL will be a \u201chands on\u201d help. \n\nYou\u2019re a new mother. You shouldn\u2019t be \u201centertaining\u201d anyone. I think in your shoes, I would ask them if they\u2019d be more comfortable in a hotel. Being woken a few times in the night by a crying baby probably isn\u2019t ideal for them, either.", "NTA book the hotel and go yourself.", "YTA you have invited your in-laws to stay to meet the baby not some random people or distant relatives. This could just be the help you need. Do you think your Mil is coming expecting you to wait on them? I'm sure she will be a great help during your recovery.  Relax and enjoy their help and don't hesitate to ask when you need something.", "NTA \n\nI feel a week is way too soon for any new mom. I think everyone meant well but you\u2019re not feeling well and I\u2019m hoping that they understand that things can change. Hubby should be more sensitive to your feelings and ask parents to either go to a hotel or not come until you\u2019re ready.

Here\u2019s the text:\n\n\"The Lemon Clot Essay\u201d (by Sharon1964)\n\nYou will be leaking out of places you don't want to leak out of. Do you really want to stand up from the couch and have your father's parents see that not only have you bled through your pad, but the blood is now running down your leg. Do you really want to say, \"honey, can you come with me to the bathroom, I am bleeding all over and I feel a huge bloodclot coming out\"... in front of them? Contrast that to \"mom, I need your help please, now, I'm bleeding all over!\" Does your husband really understand the volume of stuff that will be coming out of you, the possibility of lemon-sized clots of blood? Not 2-dimensional lemon-sized, but huge, round, 3-dimensional lemon-sized?\n\nHow many bathrooms do you have? If only one, do you REALLY want to have to make it \"guest-level clean\" every time you leave it? Do you really want this gang of people ogling your diaper-sized pads, peribottle, tucks pads, and all the other supplies that will be in the bathroom? Even if you have two bathrooms, that means you can't use the main bathroom, because you still have to leave it \"guest-level clean\" every time you use it.\nDo they really plan to do something other than hold the baby, pass the baby around, and sit around expecting you guys to wait on them? Are they going to sit and stare at you? Thirty minutes after they arrive, and baby wants to breastfeed, are they going to quickly and willingly LEAVE your home so that you can breastfeed in the privacy and comfort of your space? Or are they going to hang around outside, waiting for you to be done, and knocking every so often wanting to know if they can come back in? Yeah, that's great for breastfeeding.\n\nOr better yet, are they going to blow you off, saying \"it's no big deal\", and expect you to breastfeed in front of them? Even experienced moms need several weeks of practice to get good at it, so to speak, so that they can breastfeed wherever they want. Learning to breastfeed is not a time for people to ogle and stare at you.\nWhen your breasts are engorged and painful and you want NOTHING to touch them, what then? Does your dh think it will be okay for his dad to stare at your huge naked breasts as you walk around topless?\n\nWhat if your birth is smack in the middle of their trip? So what are they going to do the first few days, before baby? Are they going to sit and stare at you, waiting for the big moment? Then what? Are they going to camp out in your hospital room every day, all day? Yeah, that's great for resting. What happens when you leave the hospital and they beat you to your own home, and all you want to do is lay down in your own bed? Are they going to leave graciously, or are they going to sit in your living room, eating your food, messing up your house, and making noise, so you can't nap?\nDoes your DH normally allow people to invite themselves over to visit you guys without even ASKING? You guys are setting yourselves up for a lifetime of this. Then you will be blamed when you try to tell them that it is not a good time for you.\nDoes your DH understand ANY of these things?? Does he not understand that it is NOT about entertaining guests, but about recovery from a major medical procedure (either vaginal or c-section)? Does he not understand that you just grew another human being in your body, and will have just gone through the process of getting it out??

The tricky bit is, mum and MIL haven\u2019t necessarily formed the relationship for that to work.\n\nI did send my MIL home after a week when she\u2019d planned to come for two, she wasn\u2019t confident cooking in our kitchen so asked a lot of questions and she vacuumed far too much.

No vacuuming, no overwhelming questions, but on later visits if baby so much as whimpered whilst I was in the bath, my mum would be at the door, with the baby.

Even the next week or two I\u2019d have probably been tempted to overdo things had family been around, also we seemed to have oodles of appointments. My c-section recovery was ridiculously straight forward and I wonder if that was to do with me being very strict with myself. However helpful family might be, I\u2019d have joined them for meals, used the stairs more.

I was just responding to the other poster who was putting the MIL down for supposedly inviting herself, I was telling him that the MIL did NOT invite herself, OP invited them out to stay.", "People can be so unreasonable.\n\nOp had a major surgery and had 12+ lbs removed from her abdomen.\n\nUnder any other circumstances feeling unable to host two people a week after a major operation, because her recovery was more difficult than expected, would be respected.", "Okay but they could help her recover by taking on the chores and baby care. For all we know they cared for atleast one baby in the past and must be willing to help the new mother. Where I come from, no mother is left to fend for herself in those initial days. The moment a baby is born there are extended family members always in the house making sure new mother doesn't have to do anything other than feeding the baby. Everything else is taken care off by everyone including the diaper duty. Mother just lays in bed for a month and don't have to lift a finger for anything. This gives ample time to recuperate.\n\nBut I guess it's not case there. My bad for that.\n\n\nBTW I also see posts where DIL is furious because ILs don't want to babysit. Making them to stay in a hotel when they were invited guests might be the reason.", "This. Absolutely the right approach.", "That doesn\u2019t mean they have to stay the night in the same house.", "This DIL isn\u2019t saying she wants a babysitter.  She\u2019s saying she isn\u2019t ready for people outside her immediate family to be in the house all the time.  It\u2019s a completely reasonable request.", "It varies. Sometimes you get a better rate paying upfront, but it\u2019s quite common to just pay the first night. It\u2019s pretty rare (in my experience) to only give card details and then not to take anything straight away."]}
