My husband and I both work full time jobs and spend time with the kids. My husband additionally has a hobby that demands a great deal of his time for about 6 months of the year. 5 hours twice per week, and weekends or full weeks away 4-5 times per year. \n\nMy husband has had this hobby his whole life and is very good at it, and I like seeing how fulfilled it makes him. But my feelings got complicated when we had kids. \n\nWith our first born, Covid descended on our lives and prevented the hobby from happening at all. So we enjoyed (/s) the first year of lockdown huddled together with our little family of three. Then restrictions were lifted and the hobby was back on. I was pregnant again and my due date was in the middle of the hobby season. Despite being very big and uncomfortable and having a toddler to take care of, I was very often left at home by my husband when he went to go do his hobby. Indeed, when I was having contractions, husband went out to do his hobby and we went to the hospital when he got home. \n\nHe was back at the hobby 1 week after the birth, gone for 4-5 hours. Soon my mom arrived to stay with us for three weeks. It helped to have her while I was left by my husband. The new baby was very fussy, so I was sleep deprived and cranky and, increasingly, lonely. I realized that what I needed was my husband to be with me. When my mother left, my MIL visited. My husband left me alone with her. I don't really get along with his mother (and neither does he), so this was an especially awful imposition on me. It's tough breastfeeding and being vulnerable in front of a person that you don't really like.\n\nAt 8 weeks I went back to work and my husband started paternal leave. He persisted with the hobby, so I now had work and milk pumping as well as time when I had to take care of 2 children by myself. He also scheduled the longer trips. He took the children with him because he was on leave; left them with his mother while he hobbied. \n\nMy husband knew that taking care of the kids on my own was too hard for me. Too much stress. Once after I put them down for the night and was cleaning up the house, I threw my phone and it shattered. When he finally came home that night, I cried to him that I couldn't keep doing this by myself, that I needed his help, and that I was afraid of myself around the kids. He responded: \"I have taken care of the kids by myself and it's really not that hard\". From there he would ask me if he could go do his hobby, posing the question with a lot of pressure (\"it's important that I have an outlet\", etc). I would say \"yes\" and suffer again. \n\nWe went through a year of therapy that resulted in absolutely no change. I said that I will no longer be married to the hobby. \n\nHe reports that his friends and family have told him it is \"unfair\" for him to have to give up the hobby. Is that true? AITA?\n\nEdit: There are many who are saying he needs to do more as a father. I disagree. I think he does a lot with the kids. He gets up with them in the morning and makes breakfast for them. He takes them to the park, aquarium, zoo, and whatever fun thing they come up with. He is a good dad to them. The issue is that he is a terrible spouse. I don't think it would occur to him to include me in a short list of his priorities. He expects me to have sex with him but treats me like a mere coparent.\n\nSecond edit: My husband deems this all unfair on the grounds that I have misrepresented the amount of sailing he did after baby\u2019s birth. So the correction: he sailed only once per week after the birth and did the first away trip (taking baby with him) in October after her July birth. He resumed a busier schedule again last year during the year when we were working with a therapist.", "created_utc": 1675293573, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r9lve/aita_for_wanting_my_spouse_to_give_up_their_hobby/", "score": 291, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, everyone needs an outlet.  But you are drowning while he\u2019s out having fun.  He needs to find another hobby that is less time consuming.", "\"I have taken care of the kids by myself and it's really not that hard\"\n\nHe gets an outlet and you don't well that's one for him being the AH right there.\n\nHe looks after the kids for a bit and thinks continued care is easy emotionally and physically and doesn't understand the mental load of a full time parent.

It sounds like he hasn't accepted that. He's a husband and a father to two very young children, leaving you do all the work alone essentially. That hobby isn't sustainable anymore and it's completely understandable that you have voiced your frustrations on numerous occasions. \n\n\"My husband knew that taking care of the kids on my own was too hard for me.\"\n\nRight, but then why does he say something so dismissive like \"I have taken care of the kids by myself and it's really not that hard\".

I'm so sorry you are dealing with this carry on and honestly, I'd reevaluate your situation entirely.", "NTA.\n\nBoats are a black hole in the water that you throw money into.

Spending hours and hours and then days and days away from the children he helped create is incredibly selfish of him. He has responsibilities now as your husband and the father of two children. Time for him to behave responsibly.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with wanting him to stop a hobby because priorities have changed. While he might be very good at his hobby, his family has to come first and there should hopefully be a way for him to scale back instead of dropping out all together. \n\nThe real question here is what is the hobby? Knowing that will really help people with judgment.", "I know everyone keeps asking what hobby, but it doesn't matter. The amount of time he is spending on something that is purely for his own enjoyment is entirely too much. He isn't even offering to scale back, which he could do if he wasn't so selfish.

So he works full time and has his hobby on week days, during weekends plus full weeks (just gone) and parents around both?  His true kid/spouse is his hobby.

That includes your need to not be a married single parent half of the year.\n\nIf he wants to continue is hobby, he needs to find a proper balance between the amount of time he spends on the hobby and how that amount of time is making him neglect his family's needs.", "NTA. Yes, it's important for everyone to have an outlet, especially parents, but his hobby means YOU don't get to have a hobby. how is that in any way fair? and what about the kids? he's essentially an absent father at that point. what's his plan for when the kids want to start playing sports, go to school, join after school activities? will his hobby continue to supersede his children's natural desire to have their father's time and attention?\n\nalso, his comment that watching the kids \"isn't that hard\" begs the question: what is he doing while watching them? because you are clearly being very involved. is it not hard for him maybe because he pays them little attention?\n\ni would recommend finding another therapist and discussing a compromise. it shouldn't be necessary for him to commit that amount of time to his hobby. asking him to pare his time down and be home more isn't a big ask and it doesn't make you an AH. if this doesn't work, ultimatum time. either his hobby or his family, he gets to pick.", "NTA but let's be real here. He clearly loves this hobby. Asking him to give it up is going to cause a lot of resentment, even if it's not fair. Can he take a break from the hobby for a year or so while the kids are still young and need more supervision and so much of your energy? Maybe a break would go down better.\n\nAll that said, he has not been kind to you about this. Breastfeeding and pumping is a huge outlay of time and energy and has a huge emotional component. If he continues to be unkind about your very real need for support at home, he is not a good husband for you.", "It's never good to tell your spouse what to do. The only thing i feel after reading this is that he is a very selfish guy and an even worse dad. When you have kids and a wife, they should always be priority number 1. I agree that he should have an outlet but you can easily only sail 2 or 3 times a month and still have enough of an outlet. Btw, you should both have such outlets and he should facilitate it so that you can have it and he actually watches the kids, and not just brings them to his mom.", "NTA. Outlets work both ways. Do you get time to spend away from your kids on a hobby/outlet?", "NTA. Either he needs to dedicate less time to this or give you equivalent time away from the household and all responsibilities for your own \u201coutlet.\u201d It\u2019s entirely unfair for him to be able go continue life as if he hadn\u2019t become a father, except when being one doesn\u2019t interfere with what\u2019s fun for him.", "I don't think it's fair to ask him to give it up altogether, forever, but the balance is obviously off here and it sounds like he's unwilling to sail significantly less and/or give it up until the kids are older, both of which I think are reasonable asks. NTA.\n\nSidebar - just because caring for the kids alone doesn't stress him out doesn't mean you should be fine with it. We all have different limits. I also don't love the idea that he's been pushing you to go to the gym. Those things together suggest to me that he cannot accept that you have different needs and that he undervalues the physical toll of birth and breastfeeding.", "NTA I was confused about what could be so time consuming, but sailing kinda makes sense, I don't sail though, so I fail to see WHY it demands that much time. He could absolutely cut his time spent down and 100% should have when you were giving birth and recovering. Not for a couple days, for several months, if not a year. He can switch to literally anything else in the meantime. \n\nYou need to have a serious talk with him about why his hobby is more important to him than supporting you. You sacrificed your free time and body for your kids, the least he can do is be there to support you. \n\nYou should set a schedule for him that blocks out time for you, and time for him, he can do whatever hobby he wants in his time, but you get the same, even if all you do is lock yourself in your room and binge watch TV. \n\nYou should not suffer for his hobby.", "NTA. \n\nThat aside, what can you do to change the situation about your being afraid to be at home alone with the children all the time because you are exhausted and out of patience? THIS is the fire to put out first. You can't make your husband do anything he's not willing to do. You have a responsibility, yourself, to try to get some help with the kids and some breaks.\n\nHow's the money, if you're both working FT? Can you move the budget around and hire some babysitting help? \n\nA lot of parents can manage two children on their own just fine. It's probably the default. And of course, fathers should prioritize their children and husbands should be partners with their wives. But the expectations and \"shoulds\" are not the point, and not what keep your family going. It's the actual decisions and actions to make YOUR situation work so that you and your children are safe.\n\nI think he's telling you that if you push hard enough, you know he's already chosen the boat.", "NTA, hardcore. \n\nI\u2019ve gone through all your comments, but one stuck out to me in particular. It\u2019s buried under a downvoted thread, so I\u2019m going to post it below:\n\n> Thank you for this (eventual) kindness. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that he already has chosen sailing. We wouldn\u2019t be at this point if he had chosen me. I wouldn\u2019t be living in the guest room if he had chosen me.\n\nDude WHAT?? He maroons you for half of the year with most of the household/childcare duties, expects you to still have sex with him without him ever bothering to meet you on your own level, he broke a huge promise to you to work on your marriage because he loves sailing more, but *he* gets to keep the master bedroom? If that was my fianc\u00e9, he\u2019d be out on the street before the day\u2019s end. \n\nYou\u2019ve already said you\u2019d be happy coparenting with him and all of your comments are dripping with exhaustion and resentment.

Consider this your permission. \n\nBy the way, I write this as someone who also has some lifelong passions that are very important to me. I even turned one of them into my career. I understand what is driving your spouse, but that doesn\u2019t mean he gets to be selfish and neglectful to his chosen partner. In order to reap the benefits of a thing like marriage or life-partnership, *both* people have to modify their priorities, think about someone besides themselves from time to time, and put as much work into it as they expect to get out of it. (And not leave each other alone all day with the nasty MIL!) Yeah, saying no to an event/opportunity or not buying a thing you want sucks, but it's what you sign up for when you say \"I Do.\" If he\u2019s chosen sailing over you, give him what he wants.

Good fathers don't let the mother of their children struggle alone while he goes off to have a good time.  Good fathers don't just dismiss the concerns of their children's mother and say \"lmao, caring for the kids can't possibly be that hard.\". A man who does not treat the mother of his kids well can never call himself a good father.

It was no longer about him having a hobby, or her starting a hobby, it was all about her feeling lonely because he doesn't spend time doing activities WITH her.

Totally the opposite of the picture that OP painted in her original post.\n\nNot to mention that the hobby name was not mentioned, it was only described by the huge time he spends away doing it, which OP later admits were actually exaggerated. Surely this plants huge biases in the reader.\n\nI dunno, this whole thing smells like attention seeking to me, or just totally made up, not someone who actually wants to know if they're an asshole or not, or wants any way to try and improve their own situation.\n\nIf it is real, I wish OP the best, but I have my suspicions.", "NTA\n\n> He expects me to have sex with him but treats me like a mere coparent.\n\nTell him there's no sex, and he has to properly take you on dates be it at home or out of the home.

Once I decided I was fine with that it was very freeing.  I no longer had to seethe resentfully that he wasn't taking me out and we went to things I wanted.

Can you all make a plan to do more together? Will he even compromise? If your paying a professional and he still won't budge, maybe it's time to look at what would make your life better. Look kids should have somewhat happy parents and if this relationship is no longer fulfilling your needs, maybe it's time to let it go.
