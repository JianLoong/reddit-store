She also might be able to negotiate that amount down with the hospital. Not *all* hospitals will play ball, but some will. Worst they can say is no.", "Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on the situation, many hospital systems automatically consider an infant born with severe disability at high risk for abuse. And there is data to support that. \n\nThis is especially true in the US where the stress of medical bills compounds the stress of caring for a child with special needs. \n\nAnd if the condition is not well understood in modern medicine, its even harder. \n\nOne of my close friends, who was pregnant at the sane time as me and whose son was born with spinabifida after all prenatal tests were clear. Spinabifida usually is picked up in the prenatal tests, and because it typically results in severe disabilities on almost every level. Many times, parents elect for an abortion. (No judgement, it's a heartbreaking situation) \n\nBecause of this many regular pediatricians and pediatric nurses have absolutely no idea how to screen for abuse and even the difference between abuse and the results of the disorder. \n\nIn my friends situation, her husband was a RN on a critical care floor. She was college educated and gave up her career when they decided to have kids. No drugs, financially secure, plenty of family support. But they flagged as high risk due to their sons disability. \n\nAt around a year old, her son had a broken femur. Because they were already flagged and on a healthy child a broken femur is a big deal, the hospital called CPS and did full body x-rays. They determined there was signs of \"cranial trauma\" (he had a shunt in place) My friend was beside herself. She wasn't allowed to see her child for two weeks. He was held at that hospital till they could get him transferred to the children's hospital where his doctors were. \n\nBottom line, the doctors at the first hospital were unaware of how the disability could manifest both in the development of bone density and scaring from a failed shunt replacement. \n\nMy point in this long ass story is that a combination of ignorance/inexperience with whatever the child's disabilities are could easily get her flagged, especially if she made what the clinic considered \"excessive\" visits.", "And I was told numerous times growing up I would be plagued with fertility issues.

You don't tell people to fuck off and never ask for your help raising your kid if you have the child's best interests at heart instead of just deciding they were a burden you don't want to deal with.

You made an agonising choice, and you did the right thing.\n\nWhat concerns me more is that the cousin clearly knew about the medical bills. She at least had some idea of how much his condition was likely to cost her, she knew her own finances, and she had literally just seen your family give no help whatsoever. She knew about your debt, too. She knew she wasn't getting any financial support from anyone in her family. What was she thinking??\n\nI get not wanting to lose him, but she did not have his best interests in mind. Adoption isn't random, the agencies try to pair children with suitable families. In the case of a seriously ill child, they would look for a family both willing and able to take care of him and pay those bills. Your cousin stopped that from happening. She needs to consider his future, it doesn't sound like she can afford his medical bills any more than you could.", "Even if you were a billionaire, NTA.
