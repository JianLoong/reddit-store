I was put in foster care at the age of 8 and aged out. I call my birth mom by her name and I call my foster mom mom. Go to your foster family\u2019s house for Christmas. Everyone is entitled to love and peace especially at Christmas. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong. Your grandma sounds insufferable.", "Your family doesn't have to be those who are blood related. It sounds like your true family is your foster family. I understand why you want to salvage something with your mother and grandmother, but is it worth it? They make you feel bad about yourself. I'm sure they will do that to Elliot, and if they don't, they'll do it to you in front of Elliot. It's time to tell them that if they can treat you in a civil manner and stop acting judgmental, then you are perfectly willing to cut ties. I also suggest talking to your foster parents about making them Elliot's god parents (in legal terms, so they will have the care of Elliot if anything happens to you). \n\nYou mother and grandma did nothing to help you as a child. They did not support you in your grief. They have not apologized for allowing you to be abused. They do not deserve to be in your life and you don't deserve to suffer at their hands any more. \n\nSpend the holidays with your family of the heart. Spend your time and effort on those who care about you. NTA", "NTA by any stretch; spend time with the people you love and don't let your family guilt you into further suffering. If they try, tell them why.", "You are not wrong to want to spend Christmas with the people who are kind and loving to you. I spend every Christmas with my Foster Parents. \n\nDon't let your mom guilt trip you into spending Christmas with them. \n\nYour comment about spending Christmas with the people who were paid to care for you is not accurate. Our foster families were given about 300-1050 a month (pending where you lived) to take care of us.Most likely your foster parents spent far more on you and Elliot than the state would ever pay. \n\nI see it as spending time with the parents who care the most about you and Elliot. Being with the people who love you both as you are. \n\nHave a Happy Christmas.  NTA", "Nta  not at all go to ur ex foster parents and have an amazing time", "Also foster parents don\u2019t get paid that much money. It\u2019s just enough to cover basics. I know foster parents who go over the amount they are given monthly. And if your foster family still wants a relationship with you it\u2019s safe to say they built an emotional bind with you", "I have actually considered making my foster carers Elliot\u2019s godparents but I think you need to be baptised for that? I\u2019m not sure. We\u2019re not religious so I have no I idea. We live in the uk so I\u2019m not really sure how to officially go about it. If anything happened to me, social services would never let Elliot go with my family because of everything they\u2019ve put me through and they\u2019ve realised the pattern of police being called only when I\u2019m with my family and never when I\u2019ve been in foster placements.", "Yes, EXACTLY this! I hate that old saying \"You can't choose your family\". Having the same blood coursing through your veins does not make them \"family\", only a \"relative\". I know this all too well.", "Also like the, you love your family, but that doesn't mean you like them.  Always resonated with me because I choose to spend my time with people I like spending time with not only people I love.", "OP, between housing you past where the state supports you and buying you half the furniture for your new home, it sounds like your foster carers spent way more money on you than they ever received from the state to support you. Also, keep in mind, where this might vary while you live, the money a foster parent receives is often not legally considered a \"wage\" but money meant to help with the expenses incurred by the child. Considering how caring you describe your foster carers as, I expect they absolutely spent that money on you in the first place regardless.", "NTA- *people who got paid to look after me\u201d (grandmothers words)*\n\nThey aren\u2019t being paid anymore and it sounds like it was never about that for them. What a disgusting thing for your Grandmother to say. They have you in their life because they love you and your son. You have two choices, generational trauma or a new healthy path for you and your son. Spend the holiday with your foster care family, it sounds like they are the family that truly loves you for YOU.", "Your bio family have quite the cheek insulting the \u201cpaid\u201d foster carers who were only necessary because they couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t meet your needs and had to rely on someone else to do it for them. \n\nYou feel safe with your foster family. Whenever bio family come at you, I\u2019d say that you have chosen the people who chose to help you rather then the people who watched a child get abused and only want to *act* perfect rather then be even half way decent human beings.\n\nIf you have the ability, I\u2019d suggest LC with the bio relatives.\n\nNTA. You are never wrong to put your well being above those who don\u2019t even pretend to care", ">I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m somehow in the wrong for choosing to spend Christmas with \u201cpeople who got paid to look after me\u201d (grandmothers words) instead of my actual family.\n\nBlood doesn't make \"actual family\".  Actual family is the people you choose, the people you love, the people who have your back.\n\nNTA", "Your foster parents may have been 'paid to look after you' but they did so with love, patience, kindness, understanding and compassion.\n\nMiserably, foster parents also exist, at least in the UK, who are far too much like your mother and grandmother. They also get paid.\n\nYour foster parents have revealed to you all the qualities that good parents show to their children. They have shown you who they are. Believe them.\n\nYou have been away from your bio family for a long time and during that time, they have, unfortunately, not changed one bit. They too have shown you who they are and continue to be. Believe them.\n\nAs hard as it may be for you, it would seem that your bio family can never show you the same level of love and kindness as your foster family. You may never have the kind of relationship you desire, and deserve, with them.\n\nWhatever love you have to spare, spare it for the people who love you and have a wonderful Christmas with your son and foster family.\n\nIf your bio family want a relationship with your son, make sure you set strict, unbreakable, 'one strike and you're out of his life forever' boundaries. It might be worth asking for help with this set up.\n\nAnd by the way, you are NTA. Far from it.\n\nMerry Christmas", "The apple didn\u2019t fall far from the tree in regards to your mother and grandmother. NTA. RUN, run like the wind to your foster family!  Keep as far away from the toxic bullshit of the bio-family. I had different circumstances, but had to separate myself from a sister that never took responsibility for her actions and ALWAYS passive aggressive. Too toxic, life is too short. Enjoy your Christmas and all the other special days ahead.", "NTA. Be with the family that CHOSE you and makes you happy and sounds as if they love you more than the DNA relatives!!!", "NTA. Family are the people who love and support you and bring your heart peace. It doesn\u2019t matter whether there is a biological relation. Spend Christmas with the people who bring your heart peace.", "NTA. Family is who you choose, blood just makes you related. Go where you and your son will be happy and enjoy the day.", "We live in the uk, and they absolutely go above and beyond for their placements. Care leavers are given resources and some money when they move to live independently but it\u2019s not an awful lot. They\u2019ve always spoiled us at Christmas and birthdays. \nOne of the foster carers works while the other stays home, so they\u2019re only really getting enough to cover our basic expenses.", "PS: You might want to ask your Carers if it's ok to invite your Aunt as well. Sounds like she might enjoy it more too!!", "It sounds like her mother\u2019s family are all emotionally abusive.  Just because they are related by blood does not mean she should subject her and her child to these people.", "Yeah, your fosters absolutely did not \"get paid to look after you\", then. They sound like lovely, wonderful people, and you're so lucky to have them! Spend Christmas with the people who actually care about you, not your bio relatives."]}
