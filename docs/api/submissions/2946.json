My grandmother is very judgemental if things don\u2019t fit into her \u201cperfect picture\u201d and I feel like I have to preform anytime I\u2019m around family. I have recently moved into my own house with my 2yr old Elliot after living with my foster carers for 3 yrs. They\u2019ve been there everyday since Elliot was born and are honorary grandparents.

However when Christmas came around at my foster placement, there were no issues. Everyone was happy. Everyone was relaxed. Whereas things are always tense with my family. Everything has to be perfect. Everyone has to act perfect. And more often than not, I fall out with my sister (10f) and my mother always defends her. Favourite child stuff. I just want a peaceful Christmas, that\u2019s all I want. \n\nSo I made the decision that I\u2019ll be going back to my foster carers for Christmas. When I told my mother this, she immediately turned cold as she usually is and started guilt tripping me about how the family haven\u2019t spent a single Christmas with Elliot yet.
