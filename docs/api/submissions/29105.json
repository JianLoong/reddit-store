My husband is with me for appearances  and we are happy with our arrangement .\n\nMy husband and I married because I have all the \"qualifications\" to please his family and he takes financial care of me. We are very fond of each other and even love each other. But not in the classical  marriage sense. We are like amazing roommates with some benefits. He and I are free to live our life's  independently and without stresses. He is not worried about being cut off from his family and I am finally financially stable and am free to work my job that simply is not as economically beneficial. \n\nTo the problem: My sisters have never approved  of my decision. They say i sold myself. Which... fair. But still we (used) to be civil with each other.  \nLast week we hd a family BBQ. I went without my husband. Everything was going great until my oldest niece (21) sat down next to me and we started talking. And then she asked be me straight up, if I was with my husband for money. I explained to her how we met, our agreement and so on. She then asked me if i think it would be okay for her to pretend to be her gay best friends GF. I told her it was up to her to decide and if there was no negatives to it (like her having actual feelings for him, someone getting hurt like a romantic partner etc etc). It was a lovely  talk. \n\nStrike two was apparently when my other nieces asked me where my husband was and I told them, that he was on vacation. They asked me why I didn't go with him and I said that we only sometimes go together to vacations. We usually take little trips together but go on longer vacations with friends or family. My niece(16) asked me if it was true what her mom and aunt said about me being a gold digger and i just said\" i guess so\". Like, that doesn\u2019t  face me. I know my sisters constantly talk about me behind my back and I am not ashamed about my marriage at all. so i see no need to lie.\n\nLater that night my sisters cornered me and we had a fight about my words with my nieces. They said it was completely  inappropriate  what i told them. That I am free to live my fucked up life but to not let my niece think, that it is okay what  I do. I called them small minded and that I was only answering my nieces questions and I was even honest. They are free to do their own decisions. My sisters kept cornering me, calling me all sorts of names and saying i was basically influencing  their daughters negatively  because I was miserable.\n\nI said some words back and left, not talking  to them the whole week.\n\nNow there is a huge fallout because I pulled out of the family vacation because of this fight. But the vacation would be at my husbands summer House. And as I am not going, my husband doesn\u2019t  feel comfortable  lending my family the house.\n\nMy family has been calling me a huge AH and my sisters said that i was blowing things out of proportion. \n\nAITA? SHOULD i STILL GO?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1697552163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179zdme/aita_for_being_the_rason_why_the_family_vacation/", "score": 4145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That works for you.\n\nHowever, your family judges you for it, UNTIL they don't get to stay at HIS beach house because they disrespected you.\n\n\"You can't have your cake and eat it, too.\"", "Your sisters are hypocrites - if they so disagree with your life choices and find them so abhorrent, then they should not be accepting a family vacation at your summer house. \n\nRather than berating you about being a 'fucked-up' role model, they should look deep at themselves, at what values (money grubbing, hypocrisy, nastiness towards family members) THEY are showing their own children. \n\nNTA.\n\nDon't feel guilty - your marriage is your own business ('your' = yourself and husband), and definitely DO NOT HOST THOSE HORRID PEOPLE. I might reach out independently to the 21 year old to let her know the door is open, if you have a good separate relationship. But keep on living your life.", "NTA. You are the gold digger, yet they expect to reap the benefits of the gold even when they judge you for you. Entirely proportionate responce, OP. Also your nieces are old enough to start thinking for themselves and these are very good conversational topics which are better handled without parental scowl around. \n\nCongratulations on your marriage. People forget that \"marry for love\" is quite a recent thing and in not that distant past it was most like a business deal and if you could find a spouse that treats you with respect and you grow fond and friends together it was considered a successful marriage. It seems to me that's what you have, even if it is not the fairytale dream or the religious ideal.", "NTA\n\nThe only reason your nieces brought up you being a \"gold digger\" is that your family described you that way to them.

If your sisters don\u2019t like it, then they shouldn\u2019t try to use that relationship to benefit themselves.\n\nNot everybody wants to find the typical archetype of love and marriage.

If anyone's taking advantage it's your sisters, as they seem perfectly okay with benefitting from your husband's money when it means they get a vacation in his house.\n\nThere are so many posts on Reddit where the person says \"I am the reason X, Y and Z happened\" when they're not the reason at all.

First of all I find it hilarious that your sisters sit there and talk shit on you to their kids and expect them not to ask questions. Second, given your personal state of mind around the whole lifestyle I'm surprised they expect something less than honesty when their kids ask you those questions.

That, to me, says everything.\n\nYour sisters are fine with reaping all the benefits of your fucked up life, so long as they can lord their moral superiority over you and in so doing feel higher than you.  It sounds to me like your very passive personality has allowed them to treat you horribly in the past (possibly even before this marriage) and tell themselves that you deserve it... and even you know that you deserve it.  Further, they build themselves up in the eyes of their children by running you down.  The moment you make a statement that contradicts your lower gold digger status and in any way redeems you in the eyes of their children they are threatened by it.  That's not a you problem.  That's a them problem.\n\nThere may even be a little tiny piece of their conscience that is telling them they are treating you horribly... and their anger is because they are embarrassed at being tattled on by their daughters.  Also not a you problem.  \n\nThey are nowhere near as satisfied with their lives as they'd have you believe or it wouldn't be so important for you to be lower than them.\n\nI'd lay odds that you were always the pretty sister... and that they have always been very backstabby and jealous.  And for some reason you accepted that.\n\nFor you and your husband... people get married for a lot of reasons.  It is socially acceptable for a girl to get knocked up and the couple marry for the kid and spend the entire marriage miserable and fighting because he ruined her life and she trapped him... all while the kid lays awake in bed listening to his parents fight about how he ruined his parents lives (an actual argument I overheard walking down my apartment hallway 30 years ago).  Somehow that's better than a couple choosing, with eyes open, to marry for anything other than love or kids.\n\nThere is part of me that believes you knew what your husband's response to your sister's treating you this way and you backing out of the vacation for it would be.  There is no part of me that thinks this is inappropriate and applauds your husband for doing exactly what a husband is supposed to do... supporting his wife.  Sounds to me like you have a better marriage than many who marry for the right reasons.\n\nIn case it's not clear... NTA.

My husband is with me for appearances  and we are happy with our arrangement .\n\nMy husband and I married because I have all the \"qualifications\" to please his family and he takes financial care of me. We are very fond of each other and even love each other. But not in the classical  marriage sense. We are like amazing roommates with some benefits. He and I are free to live our life's  independently and without stresses. He is not worried about being cut off from his family and I am finally financially stable and am free to work my job that simply is not as economically beneficial. \n\nTo the problem: My sisters have never approved  of my decision. They say i sold myself. Which... fair. But still we (used) to be civil with each other.  \nLast week we hd a family BBQ. I went without my husband. Everything was going great until my oldest niece (21) sat down next to me and we started talking. And then she asked be me straight up, if I was with my husband for money. I explained to her how we met, our agreement and so on. She then asked me if i think it would be okay for her to pretend to be her gay best friends GF. I told her it was up to her to decide and if there was no negatives to it (like her having actual feelings for him, someone getting hurt like a romantic partner etc etc). It was a lovely  talk. \n\nStrike two was apparently when my other nieces asked me where my husband was and I told them, that he was on vacation. They asked me why I didn't go with him and I said that we only sometimes go together to vacations. We usually take little trips together but go on longer vacations with friends or family. My niece(16) asked me if it was true what her mom and aunt said about me being a gold digger and i just said\" i guess so\". Like, that doesn\u2019t  face me. I know my sisters constantly talk about me behind my back and I am not ashamed about my marriage at all. so i see no need to lie.\n\nLater that night my sisters cornered me and we had a fight about my words with my nieces. They said it was completely  inappropriate  what i told them. That I am free to live my fucked up life but to not let my niece think, that it is okay what  I do. I called them small minded and that I was only answering my nieces questions and I was even honest. They are free to do their own decisions. My sisters kept cornering me, calling me all sorts of names and saying i was basically influencing  their daughters negatively  because I was miserable.\n\nI said some words back and left, not talking  to them the whole week.\n\nNow there is a huge fallout because I pulled out of the family vacation because of this fight. But the vacation would be at my husbands summer House. And as I am not going, my husband doesn\u2019t  feel comfortable  lending my family the house.\n\nMy family has been calling me a huge AH and my sisters said that i was blowing things out of proportion. \n\nAITA? SHOULD i STILL GO?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Lol.", "Calling her a gold digger is like calling someone a cheater for having sex with the third member of a happy thruple who each walked into the relationship knowing that they and the other(s) were poly, and whose initial members fully agreed on the rules for when and how sex outside the currently established group was appropriate and what conditions allowed new entries into the core relationship. \n\nI know that I am Aro/Ace and to me all methods of pairing (or grouping) off are equally theoretical and if everyone is an adult, mentally sound, and of roughly equal power when the things the individuals want and need from each other is balanced out and all that arranged marriages (with everyone on same page on having one), marriages of convenience (with everyone on same page), love stories (everyone agreeing on relationship\u2019s basic definitions and goals) etc are all valid. My History degree has seen all work (and all fail and all function with maintenance)", "Agree. People can have any type of marriage as long as both ppl consent. I have 2 friends who married platonically to support each other in every way, except romantically. Would these sisters say they're \"fake lesbians\"?! \nI can also see why OP wanted to get away from her family,they sound awful. I wouldn't spend time with anyone from my family unless they earn it by treating me fairly.", "Agree. OP and her husband even have enough affection for one another that they're both fine with this. The only problem here is the sisters.\n\nThey ruined their own vacation. Maybe they'll learn not to talk shit.", "Jup. As someone whose family and childhood was destroyed by a gold-digger - that ain't it. Both have an open agreement where no emotions are faked for financial benefits, no third party is hurt to get money out of the situation, it is a good cooperation based on a probably oppressive family of the husband's side.", "Nah a gold digger is someone that married for money", "The best part is OP is so nice and rational talking about it to nieces that it's 100% back-fired and now nieces think their parents are mean and nasty!  \ud83d\ude02", "Anyone else get a whiff of jealousy?", "If they feel comfortable saying all the things they've said to her face, just imagine what they're saying around her nieces when OP's not around.", "The kids can tell their moms are unhappy and describe OP as bad, unhappy. When they ask OP, she's happy. This is what their moms are mad about: they want their daughters to think OP is the unhappy one and she is projecting the opposite.", "Yeah I don't get the logic. \n\nOP don't discuss your marriage situation with our children because we're badmouthing you behind your back about it", "And I bet they are jealous! I bet OP has a rockin' life/body/life balance and they are suffering through middle class frumpiness. \n\nOP, screw them. Live your life. \n\nI hope you do stay in touch with your nieces though. My parents are useless but my relationships with my aunties and uncles has been crucial to my life.", "First thing I thought, as well. The only reason the conversations took place was because the children had heard their mothers speaking poorly of the situation.", "The niece is 16. While they PROBABLY talk about OP behind her back, the nieces are old enough to make their own observations.", "Exactly correct.\n\nIt proves the OP's family are the real assholes", "I mean, isn\u2019t that kinda what her sisters are doing expecting their BIL will pay for their vacation home? Faking care and love enough for their sis and her husband to be able to have luxuries they otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to afford.", "Not the person you're replying to but I think they're likely making the distinction because Gold Digger often implies manipulation and deceit. She's not pretending she fell in love with her husband or that her affections are anything more than they are to get her hands on his money. They decided on a mutually beneficial relationship openly and honestly. It's more transactional than most people approve of in many modern cultures. I don't think I'd like it for myself. I can't quite put her in the same category as a typical gold digger, though, because she isn't lying to him.", "She's not trying to deceive him, and they have an agreed arrangement. She's bringing something he finds useful to the table--a stable cover story for his lifestyle choices or maybe sexual orientation. She still works and lives her life with a positive outlook of him and their arrangement. \n\nGold-digger always had a parasitic vibe, in my mind; this is more of a mutualistic relationship.", "Gold-digger who won't get their own hands dirty,  but always have hands out for the gold..", "^THIS^ OMFG YES.", "I was with my husband for 10 years when I suddenly realized *I can still love him & NOT WANT TO GO TO ANOTHER CHICK FLICK*. He went to see \"Titanic\" on his own & we're still married! \ud83e\udd23", "With a shovel emoji", "Right?! And I honestly think they are very jealous of OP. If they had the same opportunity, I bet they would have taken it.", "Same, I read this and the whole time I was like \"How does it feel to be living my dream?\" My law school debt isn't going to pay itself (and I wish I didn't have to be the one paying it :\\).", "Again, hence the esh.", "> It's unconventional \n\nIt's probably more conventional for a certain long period of history than marriages for love are!", "When the expectations are clear, and behavior is consistent, then respect forms. Sometimes it's a more meaningful relationship when it's based on mutual respect.", "People get married for all kinds of reasons, and stay married for even more varied reasons. Nothing is wrong with this. Sisters are judgey and jealous.", "It's hard to stay happy and in love under the constant stress poor finances tend to cause.", "Even people who marry for love think about earning potential when they are dating.", "It sounds like your mom needs a dog lol", "I never knew those definitions\u2026 Thank you for posting and explaining them.", "i want this life so badly lmao", "right that\u2019s literally the only way i would choose to get married", "And he respects her enough to have her back against her envious sisters.", "Exactly! They set the ball in motion by telling their kids that OP is a gold digger, they don't have the right to complain when the girls ask their aunt about. But they are not outraged enough to get a free holiday to stay at his holiday home! Ridiculous! They reap what the sow! Enjoy staying at a motel 6 sisters! NTA", "A big ol' snootful!", "Yes, they are pissed they couldn't hook that deal up for themselves.", "Yep, my wife is as poor as me and has no beach house.\n\nWhere do people find these awesome rich husbands?", "Your comment gave me hope. I hope my niblings know how much I love them and they can count on me.", "Sounds like the nieces were smart enough to be less judgemental about it, though!", "And its not one sided. She is bringing certain attributes and qualifications to the marriage that he seeks to appease his family.", "I sometimes travel with my husband and sometimes alone, because I like to travel more than he does and to more adventurous places than he wants to go most of the time. We went to the Netherlands together this year and had a lovely time. A year earlier, I went to Africa on my own and had just as wonderful a time. You know who was the happiest for me? My husband. \n\nAny form of relationship is okay so long as everyone involved 1) has chosen it willingly and with full knowledge, and 2) is thriving within its terms. That sure looks like a picture of OP's marriage to me.", "Ok but who do you think should explain this if not OP?", "Answer the question. Who is the appropriate person to explain it?", "Oh, definitely! Through most of history, a woman typically hoped for (since she didn't get a choice; her father decided) a man who could support her financially and whom she could like and respect because he treated her well. Romantic love was a thing for storybooks, not for *marriage.* In fact, even in the storybooks, romantic love rarely ended in marriage... the two just weren't seen as having anything to do with each other.", "Charlotte Lucas enters the chat.", "Love marriages are new fangled things like diamond rings and white wedding dresses", "Most Jane Austen novels revolve around this point", "Yup. \u201cLavender marriages\u201d and many other arrangements exist for a reason. As long as both parties are upfront with each other, no harm no foul.", "I one time heard someone say \u201ca happy marriage means something different to different people\u201d. Where you are from, your background, personal preferences, trauma, fears, culture, and so much more shapes how you view love and marriage. So many marriages are unhappy ones, if OP is happy why shit on that. As someone else brought up, probably jealousy.", "As we used to say: Romance without Finance is a Nuisance.", "Yep, you'll always be the most important person to your dog.", "Harry Truman famously said, \"If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\"", "Right. Sounded like she was more curious and not judgmental. I hope she keeps that quality.", "Prolly her parents. She could have said \u201ci understand your curiosity, now go ask your mom.\u201d Instead of going into the details of how they met and the arrangement. Pretty simple. Also, relax.", "It\u2019s what Juliet means when she tells Romeo \u2018you kiss by the book\u2019 - that he is like a romantic hero in a story", "Yep, which is why I have a sapphire ring and wore a ruby red wedding dress.\n\n\n(Though I did marry for love)", "Lol so their parents can talk even more shit? Nevermind the fact that the only reason the daughters asked anything was because their mom's were already talking shit."]}
