My husband is with me for appearances  and we are happy with our arrangement .\n\nMy husband and I married because I have all the \"qualifications\" to please his family and he takes financial care of me. We are very fond of each other and even love each other. But not in the classical  marriage sense. We are like amazing roommates with some benefits. He and I are free to live our life's  independently and without stresses. He is not worried about being cut off from his family and I am finally financially stable and am free to work my job that simply is not as economically beneficial. \n\nTo the problem: My sisters have never approved  of my decision. They say i sold myself. Which... fair. But still we (used) to be civil with each other.  \nLast week we hd a family BBQ. I went without my husband. Everything was going great until my oldest niece (21) sat down next to me and we started talking. And then she asked be me straight up, if I was with my husband for money. I explained to her how we met, our agreement and so on. She then asked me if i think it would be okay for her to pretend to be her gay best friends GF. I told her it was up to her to decide and if there was no negatives to it (like her having actual feelings for him, someone getting hurt like a romantic partner etc etc). It was a lovely  talk. \n\nStrike two was apparently when my other nieces asked me where my husband was and I told them, that he was on vacation. They asked me why I didn't go with him and I said that we only sometimes go together to vacations. We usually take little trips together but go on longer vacations with friends or family. My niece(16) asked me if it was true what her mom and aunt said about me being a gold digger and i just said\" i guess so\". Like, that doesn\u2019t  face me. I know my sisters constantly talk about me behind my back and I am not ashamed about my marriage at all. so i see no need to lie.\n\nLater that night my sisters cornered me and we had a fight about my words with my nieces. They said it was completely  inappropriate  what i told them. That I am free to live my fucked up life but to not let my niece think, that it is okay what  I do. I called them small minded and that I was only answering my nieces questions and I was even honest. They are free to do their own decisions. My sisters kept cornering me, calling me all sorts of names and saying i was basically influencing  their daughters negatively  because I was miserable.\n\nI said some words back and left, not talking  to them the whole week.\n\nNow there is a huge fallout because I pulled out of the family vacation because of this fight. But the vacation would be at my husbands summer House. And as I am not going, my husband doesn\u2019t  feel comfortable  lending my family the house.\n\nMy family has been calling me a huge AH and my sisters said that i was blowing things out of proportion. \n\nAITA? SHOULD i STILL GO?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1697552163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179zdme/aita_for_being_the_rason_why_the_family_vacation/", "score": 11354, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That works for you.\n\nHowever, your family judges you for it, UNTIL they don't get to stay at HIS beach house because they disrespected you.\n\n\"You can't have your cake and eat it, too.\"", "Your sisters are hypocrites - if they so disagree with your life choices and find them so abhorrent, then they should not be accepting a family vacation at your summer house. \n\nRather than berating you about being a 'fucked-up' role model, they should look deep at themselves, at what values (money grubbing, hypocrisy, nastiness towards family members) THEY are showing their own children. \n\nNTA.\n\nDon't feel guilty - your marriage is your own business ('your' = yourself and husband), and definitely DO NOT HOST THOSE HORRID PEOPLE. I might reach out independently to the 21 year old to let her know the door is open, if you have a good separate relationship. But keep on living your life.", "NTA. You are the gold digger, yet they expect to reap the benefits of the gold even when they judge you for you. Entirely proportionate responce, OP. Also your nieces are old enough to start thinking for themselves and these are very good conversational topics which are better handled without parental scowl around.\n\nCongratulations on your marriage. People forget that \"marry for love\" is quite a recent thing and in not that distant past it was most like a business deal and if you could find a spouse that treats you with respect and you grow fond and friends together it was considered a successful marriage. It seems to me that's what you have, even if it is not the fairytale dream or the religious ideal.  \n\n\nP.S. Since so many replies to me seem to lack at least some level of reading comprehension - here I stated \"you are **the** gold digger, yet they expect\" - because her sisters call her that.

If your sisters don\u2019t like it, then they shouldn\u2019t try to use that relationship to benefit themselves.\n\nNot everybody wants to find the typical archetype of love and marriage.

If anyone's taking advantage it's your sisters, as they seem perfectly okay with benefitting from your husband's money when it means they get a vacation in his house.\n\nThere are so many posts on Reddit where the person says \"I am the reason X, Y and Z happened\" when they're not the reason at all.  The reason is that someone treated you like crap and there are consequences to behaving that way.

It all sounds very sensible and mature.", "HAHAHAHA the irony of them being pissed off at not getting to use your husbands summer house, which they wouldn't have access to if you didn't marry for money, because they judged you and cornered you and complained about your life choices.

First of all I find it hilarious that your sisters sit there and talk shit on you to their kids and expect them not to ask questions. Second, given your personal state of mind around the whole lifestyle I'm surprised they expect something less than honesty when their kids ask you those questions.

That, to me, says everything.\n\nYour sisters are fine with reaping all the benefits of your fucked up life, so long as they can lord their moral superiority over you and in so doing feel higher than you.  It sounds to me like your very passive personality has allowed them to treat you horribly in the past (possibly even before this marriage) and tell themselves that you deserve it... and even you know that you deserve it.  Further, they build themselves up in the eyes of their children by running you down.  The moment you make a statement that contradicts your lower gold digger status and in any way redeems you in the eyes of their children they are threatened by it.  That's not a you problem.  That's a them problem.\n\nThere may even be a little tiny piece of their conscience that is telling them they are treating you horribly... and their anger is because they are embarrassed at being tattled on by their daughters.  Also not a you problem.  \n\nThey are nowhere near as satisfied with their lives as they'd have you believe or it wouldn't be so important for you to be lower than them.\n\nI'd lay odds that you were always the pretty sister... and that they have always been very backstabby and jealous.  And for some reason you accepted that.\n\nFor you and your husband... people get married for a lot of reasons.  It is socially acceptable for a girl to get knocked up and the couple marry for the kid and spend the entire marriage miserable and fighting because he ruined her life and she trapped him... all while the kid lays awake in bed listening to his parents fight about how he ruined his parents lives (an actual argument I overheard walking down my apartment hallway 30 years ago).  Somehow that's better than a couple choosing, with eyes open, to marry for anything other than love or kids.\n\nThere is part of me that believes you knew what your husband's response to your sister's treating you this way and you backing out of the vacation for it would be.  There is no part of me that thinks this is inappropriate and applauds your husband for doing exactly what a husband is supposed to do... supporting his wife.  Sounds to me like you have a better marriage than many who marry for the right reasons.\n\nIn case it's not clear... NTA.

My husband is with me for appearances  and we are happy with our arrangement .\n\nMy husband and I married because I have all the \"qualifications\" to please his family and he takes financial care of me. We are very fond of each other and even love each other. But not in the classical  marriage sense. We are like amazing roommates with some benefits. He and I are free to live our life's  independently and without stresses. He is not worried about being cut off from his family and I am finally financially stable and am free to work my job that simply is not as economically beneficial. \n\nTo the problem: My sisters have never approved  of my decision. They say i sold myself. Which... fair. But still we (used) to be civil with each other.  \nLast week we hd a family BBQ. I went without my husband. Everything was going great until my oldest niece (21) sat down next to me and we started talking. And then she asked be me straight up, if I was with my husband for money. I explained to her how we met, our agreement and so on. She then asked me if i think it would be okay for her to pretend to be her gay best friends GF. I told her it was up to her to decide and if there was no negatives to it (like her having actual feelings for him, someone getting hurt like a romantic partner etc etc). It was a lovely  talk. \n\nStrike two was apparently when my other nieces asked me where my husband was and I told them, that he was on vacation. They asked me why I didn't go with him and I said that we only sometimes go together to vacations. We usually take little trips together but go on longer vacations with friends or family. My niece(16) asked me if it was true what her mom and aunt said about me being a gold digger and i just said\" i guess so\". Like, that doesn\u2019t  face me. I know my sisters constantly talk about me behind my back and I am not ashamed about my marriage at all. so i see no need to lie.\n\nLater that night my sisters cornered me and we had a fight about my words with my nieces. They said it was completely  inappropriate  what i told them. That I am free to live my fucked up life but to not let my niece think, that it is okay what  I do. I called them small minded and that I was only answering my nieces questions and I was even honest. They are free to do their own decisions. My sisters kept cornering me, calling me all sorts of names and saying i was basically influencing  their daughters negatively  because I was miserable.\n\nI said some words back and left, not talking  to them the whole week.\n\nNow there is a huge fallout because I pulled out of the family vacation because of this fight. But the vacation would be at my husbands summer House. And as I am not going, my husband doesn\u2019t  feel comfortable  lending my family the house.\n\nMy family has been calling me a huge AH and my sisters said that i was blowing things out of proportion. \n\nAITA? SHOULD i STILL GO?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Fuck them.", "NTA\n\nSince OP is happy with the marriage the sisters should keep opinions to themselves.\n\nThe sisters caused the problem by sharing their condescending thoughts with their kids.\n\nThey are hypocrites for looking down on OP and at the same time taking advantage of her and husband's generosity.", "NTA. Why should they get to criticise you the way they do and also expect all the rewards you get?", "NTA. Your sisters disapprove of your lifestyle, run you down to other family members, and then want to benefit from that lifestyle? I would simply say that they made their feelings clear on how they do not approve of your choices so you know they wouldn't feel comfortable staying at the house as you sold yourself for it. Choose other locations for future family vacations that don't belong to anyone else. And why would you go to be humiliated by them? You made an adult choice with your husband that you both are in agreement with. I would stress to your nieces that there are different types of love. The love you have for your husband is more of a best friend love and you have chosen to live life together.", "NTA - there is NOTHING wrong going on here because you and your husband are honest with each other. You probably have a better relationship than anyone else you know and your sisters CANNOT STAND IT.\n\nAnd yes, they can't have the vacation house if they are so ANGRY at your arrangement. Spoils go to the victor, and they are not it.", "It sounds like you have an honest and open arrangement with your husband and aren\u2019t hiding anything so gold digger doesn\u2019t really fit.  Your sisters opened the door for these questions by shit talking you in front of your nieces and you did the responsible thing of answering their questions honestly.  Your family are happy to profit off of your relationship but want the right to criticize you openly for it also?  Hell no! NTA", "NTA.  Your sisters probably wished they had your looks or your courage to marry rich.  So, instead they talk behind your back and gold dig vicariously through you.  They feel entitled to use your summer house.", "NTA- what you have sounds amazing and it sounds like they are extremely jealous of your freedoms and happiness not to mention your bank account. They are the AH for thinking they can judge you, talk shit about you to your impressionable nieces, talk shit about your husband and still get the benefit of his fortune. You are being an amazing example to them and not filling their heads with Disney bullshit lies on how romance works. This sounds like an amazing partnership and I\u2019m so glad you are not letting their jealousy impact your life", "**NTA** People marry and stay married for different reasons.  As long as you both are happy that is all that counts, and it is none of your sisters business. \n\nYour sisters on the other hand are complete hypocrites for not wanting *you* to benefit from your husband\u2019s  wealth \u2014 but want to benefit from it themselves by free access to his beach house.", "NTA. You honestly answered questions from them, and rightfully so. 16 is plenty old enough to get an honest answer. Remember, your nieces only asked because their mothers were talking to them about you behind your back. Treating you with respect even when you're not around should be a baseline expectation.", "LMFAO!!!\n\nTHEY HAVE THE NERVE TO JUDGE YOU BUT WANT TO ENJOY THE PERKS.\n\nOP don\u2019t fold. How nobody had your back is wild. \n\nYou should cut them off from anything that they benefit from your marriage. Doesn\u2019t mean you have to cut them off but I don\u2019t think any of us would be surprised", "I mean if they don\u2019t like your marriage they don\u2019t like your summer house \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "100% my reaction!!! Priceless. Also OP, you aren\u2019t a gold digger. You are just in an unconventional relationship. Many people are. Your marriage sounds healthier than most tbh, you are respectful of each other, help each other out and are enjoying life. What more could you ask?", "No better way to put it than that quote \ud83d\ude02", "My grandmother was young and beautiful and very poor. The wealthiest guy in town noticed her one day. And her life changed. (The fortunes of her entire itinerant farming family changed too. My grandmother's husband provided for all of them and gave them land and work and other property.) \n\nSo, the idea that someone trades up for a better life does not offend me. It can be noble or ignoble - doesn't matter. Its that person's business. My old grandmother told me she couldn't even remember exactly when she realized she was in love with her husband and her marriage wasn't really about any a duty to her family.", "Whooo let me just catch my breath because I friggin SPRINTED to the comments to point this out\u2026\n\nLike you\u2019re a gold digger but they are angry that they cannot enjoy the spoils of your relationship?", "Exactly what I was going to say!!!!!! They had the absolute audacity to do that.", "Sounds like they are confused and angry that they can\u2019t cross the bridge they just burned. Good time to put some distance between you and your sisters OP.", "Aw hell! I thought it was Kate and Edith.", "\u201cSisters, I hear you loud and clear that you do not want your children to think what I do is ok.  I understand and respect that; as a result, I cannot in good conscience let them see the glorious home we were previously going to use as a family vacation.  I\u2019m sure you would not want to even have the appearance of agreeing with or benefitting from my *checks notes* Gold Digging ways, so I am sure you are relieved that you don\u2019t have to think of a way to back out.\u201d", "Even the traditional fictional fairytale dream was the poor common girl marrying the prince she met the day before.", "They tell their kids she is a gold digger and other stuff behind her back and then they say she's the one who is inappropriate when she is honest and owns up to how she lives her life. Then gets mad when the benefits (extended to them) that comes with what they claim was inappropriate gets taken away from them. I'd just say, \"Just looking out for you and your kids' moral compass. I don't want you to be associated with my gold digging.\"", "My husband and I almost never travel together. It's not uncommon. I travel for experiences, he travels for relaxation.", "Ooh nice", "Also just take your nieces on vacation. Leave the sisters at home", "You know what, good for you, and good for OP!", "Yas! Get itttt", "Or gold digger implies you are going to take his gold and leave. As OP has not said anything to that effect either way we don\u2019t know. But by staying married I don\u2019t see them as gold digging exactly.", "But the sisters accused her of being miserable \ud83d\ude06", "Exactly! A gold digger to me is digging on someone who\u2019s unaware of it. They made a mutually beneficial deal. Honestly good for her, not everyone cares about finding a long romantic relationship.", "OP is living my dream", ">Well yeah but she loves her beard, they are well suited companions and they are enjoying the life they share together.  What's not to like?  At least she likes her husband!  That's more than I can say about many \"happily married women\"", "Oh my gosh-- I totally didn't get that, but you're probably right! That makes sense. I don't think it really changes anything morally in terms of OP's position, but interesting (and sad)", "That's the part that frigging pissed me off the most. The fact that they OBVIOUSLY called her a gold digger enough times that the nieces actually asked about it and they had the nerve to get angry when she said \"I guess so.\" Hypocritical much? Like you can badmouth your own sister but she has to pretend everything is OK and not even comment? Screw that NTA", "As if their parents would let them go?", "But \u201cgold digging\u201d is ok when family wants a free vacation!", "They won't have a choice with the 21yo.", ">Instead, she brings him the stuff that got his family off his case, and she got access to his wealth.\n\nBeing Asexual for the past 20+ years, I would \u2764 to be in a relationship like this.  Someone to care and love as family while he takes care of me financially and also care & love me as family too.  PERFECT\u2763  I agree with everyone else, the sisters are jealous.", "Yep, absolutely no honest answers until you can rent a car, young adult woman! /s", "There's ways, I think. The 21 year old is theoretically a grown adult who can see whomever she pleases, but I do understand if her situation isn't that simple - if she's still dependent on her mother for housing or help with paying for college. The 16 year old is obviously still under her mother's roof and subject to more rules. My thought is a groupchat with them - on phones that Cool Aunt pays for. Rules around usage are fine for 16 (times she can use it, doesn't take it to school, etc), but otherwise they are not to be touched by her sisters. I know there's always going to be wrinkles I haven't thought of, but it's a place to start, at least.", "I have a set of friends like this from when I was in high school. Back in \"our\" day, you could be fired for just appearing gay. They wanted to have careers and kids and a family. All the things a gay person just couldn't have back then. So they got married. They loved each other dearly and stayed married even when the laws and society had changed. Because they had a wonderful, loving, relationship.", "You're so disgusting for selling your body for the beach house, you're such an asshole for not letting me use the beach house for which you sold your body to earn."]}
