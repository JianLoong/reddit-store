Two bathrooms between six people, one of which has to be shared between four people, another one should have been priority and was on the cards. You didn't do it because it was expensive, but managed to renovate the garage and when you came into money decided newer projects were more important. That you converted part of the garage into a laundry space indicates the space you were already using for laundry before then was open for another bathroom, a project that would have served a far more practical value than work on the backyard.", "YTA for nothing more than lying to your children. All you have done is said that your wants and desires are much more important than your children's.

Not an effing gym. I can work out anywhere, in very little space.\n\nYTA for having your priorities mixed up.", "Yeah YTA. You\u2019re literally re-doing every inch of your property except the one thing that would improve the lives of your children.", "Info: Why is the third bathroom lower priority than existing bathroom/kitchen reno and outdoor work?", "YTA for lying. It wouldn\u2019t be AH behaviour to not put in a new bathroom if you were upfront about it, but instead you lied.", "YTA \n\nSeems everything got an overhaul except what was actually needed. The backyard, really? Did you build an outhouse and an outdoor shower?", "YTA. the kids have every right to be upset because YOU said you\u2019re going to do it and keep pushing it down the list. If you don\u2019t want to do it, just say that so that they know the truth.", "YTA. Improving the lives of your children should have been first on the list when you came into money, not fifth. Your kids are old enough that they will remember how selfish you were.", "YTA, a gym is more important that a room for your daughter or a bathroom so all of your chip live more comfortably. I won\u2019t be surprised if all your children stop talking to you and your husband when they move out of your home", "YTA. You have two kids sharing a room, but though a gym and an office was more important? I\u2019d be absolutely livid if I was your children.", "YTA renovating the existing bathrooms and kitchen those are understandable and acceptable.  Moving the laundry room to the garage that\u2019s normal and not much of a renovation.  Putting gym equipment in the garage really isn\u2019t a renovation just deciding how much of the garage is the gym.  The home office in the garage is putting up a few walls which isn\u2019t a hard DIY project. \n\nSo the expense went to the bathrooms and kitchen.  Now the real issue is why the backyard is more important than renovating the old laundry room now that it no longer has a purpose.  Even the smallest of laundry rooms could fit a shower stall, toilet and sink with a cabinet maybe even a linen closet.  The biggest expense would be the plumbing.  Keep in mind a third bathroom will up the value of the house and add to the livable space that moving the laundry room afforded.\n\nThe backyard renovation could be a work in progress that is depending on the renovations.  Are they planning on a pool with a waterfall, hot tub and an outdoor kitchen?  Now that would take quite a bit of funds.\nSo renovating the garage is a budget friendly renovation done with little knowledge and an electrician.", "YTA. \n\nLots of people live in much smaller accommodations then you and your children, so sharing a bathroom and/or a bedroom isn't a big deal. \n\nHowever, you promised them another bathroom for \"awhile\" and yet you got around to doing something just for your husband and something just for you, then more stuff around the house, and maybe now you will do what you have been promising. \n\nWhen you tell your children you will do something, they rely on you to do that. When they see that you aren't keeping your promise, it hurts them. In this case, you could have told them no, but instead you said \"yes, later\" and said it was because it was expensive. You didn't say,  \"later, after X, Y, Z\" and your children see you prioritizing you and your husband over them. Now you have a room and a bathroom just for the parents, you each have an extra room for your own personal use (office and gym) and didn't even bother to talk to your kids about the order of things and can't imagine why they are upset when there are 4 of them sharing 1 bathroom and 2 sharing a room. \n\nIt is clear to your kids that you don't keep your word, and you will put you and your husband's wants over theirs. So this isn't about them being entitled kids, this about you being selfish and your kids calling you out for it.", "Why do they not just use your bathroom? Let me guess y\u2019all don\u2019t want to share with them?? YTA", "YTA\n\nEven if that\u2019s an unpopular opinion. You promised them you\u2019d build a 3rd bathroom, but then said you couldn\u2019t get to it because it costs too much. But in that time you\u2019ve built/renovated a bunch of other things.

Would another bathroom be a luxury, yes, but one that would significantly improve everyone\u2019s days\u2026", "Yes, but after renovating the garage and having the space for the third bathroom, they decided to renovate the other two bathrroms, the kitchen, and do the yard instead. That makes OP TA.", "They also said they chose to work on the backyard before adding the bathroom. \n\nRegardless a home office and a home gym is not more important than giving your children their own independent rooms. The twins shouldn\u2019t be sharing a room.", "Right, but, they went ahead and updated the kitchen and the 2 already existing bathrooms and now wanting to do the backyard before even touching that now empty room/former laundry room that should be the 3rd bathroom.\nYTA! (Edit: typo)", "Exactly the girls need keep getting pushed back for the parents wants", "OP says it\u2019s next on her list, not that they aren\u2019t going to do it. You can\u2019t just tear an entire house down and renovate the whole thing at the same time. They haven\u2019t told her kids \u201ceh, we don\u2019t want to do it anymore so we\u2019re doing this for ourselves instead.\u201d Maybe they got a sweet deal on concrete for the garage so it made more sense to do it first. Maybe the time of year for landscaping the yard is more ideal to do right now. Maybe dad has had poor mental health and a separate gym is essential for him to keep running his household. Maybe mom needs to quit being interrupted while she\u2019s working and an office will give her that. \n\n Teenagers don\u2019t have that kind of information when it comes to certain decisions, and honestly they probably don\u2019t care. \nThen they grow up and have their own places, they can do whatever they want.", "And they promised the girls a bathroom. Now OP and her husband are just liars.", "They\u2019re going to do it, it\u2019s getting there. The kids don\u2019t run the house. They can work out a bathroom schedule.", "Also, it\u2019s likely a smaller bathroom too. If it\u2019s anything like the second bathroom in every home I\u2019ve lived in there is room for one person in it and almost no storage space. I get it\u2019s a first world complaint, but damn, do it before the yard.", "I mean it sucks but seems very first world problems to me.", "Even adding a half bath with a good vanity would have made a big difference!", "exactly!! i agree an extra bathroom is not a necessity, but the issue is that they told their kids that they would do this project for a while and went back on their word", "I've lived with 9 people and one bathroom.  Different people, different perspectives.", "Ya. It\u2019s so entitled to want something that they\u2019ve been told repeatedly said they would get. How is that entitled. They ask for it, parents said they will do it, then proceed to do everything else except what they said they would.", "No they don\u2019t, they sound disappointed in their parents for lying to them repeatedly about putting in a bathroom.", "Still NTA because you're getting to it eventually.", "It really wasn't bad at all and if I was in a family of 6 again then yeah I could do it. It's not that bad and it seems to me that people don't understand how lucky they are to live in nice homes even if it's only 2 bathrooms, though the bedroom thing I do agree with. Hated sharing a room with my younger brother.", "I was responding the to above poster\u2019s \u201cgotcha\u201d phrase. All of the renovations are luxuries. \n\nAlso if they are going to turn the old laundry room into a bathroom then it sounds like they did need the second laundry room, since that will replace the old one when it is turned into a bathroom.", "In every house I\u2019ve lived in and visited the main bathroom has been the bigger bathroom, with the parents bathroom being an en-suite that\u2019s much smaller.\n\nDifferent parts of the world I guess. But funny how it\u2019s so different.", "A third bathroom at least serves a practical purpose. What practical purpose does remodelling the kitchen, getting in a home gym or doing work on the backyard have that's more important?", "And you wouldn\u2019t prefer to have another bathroom before a home gym and a renovated backyard?", "Living with 9 people - must be rich af!", "The kitchen provides food for 6, a new bathroom means there\u2019s now two people per bathroom to fight over it. \n\nBackyard work can be just as much about maintaining the integrity of the foundation/home. \n\nI just turned my garage into a gym, it\u2019s around $500 if you aren\u2019t including the equipment and where I\u2019m at it won\u2019t even take 6 months to be in the black on that investment. \n\nAdditionally, there are ways to mitigate the bathroom issues. Using the toilet shouldn\u2019t take much more than 10 minutes, showering is what 30 minutes? If they are blowing their hair dry, or doing their makeup, or otherwise taking up bathroom space for things that don\u2019t require the bathroom then that\u2019s an issue that\u2019s easy to address. \n\nI\u2019d sit the kids down and lay out the costs for a new bathroom, can be 10-30k depending on plumbing. This isn\u2019t a piddly expense. And then I\u2019d ask the family stepping in what their donation is going to be.", "It\u2019s on the list. Geez. Reddit is either full of teenagers or full of people that think children should run their families.", "No, I would absolutely love either of thos things.", "Sadly no.  Maybe someday.", "I\u2019m gonna be real with you. As someone who shared a bathroom with 8 other people, I cannot believe this. Maybe I drink too much water or have regular bowel movements. Because I cannot imagine 10 people having to pee, poop, shower, and brush their teeth in one place everyday, without very different personal schedules and an extremely detailed bathroom schedule would like to have a renovated backyard before another bathroom. And I live in South Florida, backyards are very important here.", "The one thing that was funny in the place with 9 people was that one roommate and I were the only ones that ever worked early hours and it was like spy vs spy in the mornings with both of us trying to get the bathroom first to get ready."]}
