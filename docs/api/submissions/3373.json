Why did you have kids if you prefer keeping the comforts for yourself?", "\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying we\u2019ll convert the laundry room into a bathroom for a while.\u201d\n\nINFO: how long is \u2018a while\u2019 and how transparent were you with your plans while you undertook work on SEVEN different rooms/spaces instead of the promised bathroom?\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand that now the laundry is done we have the space for the bathroom.\u201d Why do they not understand this?

Don\u2019t make promises you won\u2019t care to keep.

If so, explain that to them.\n\nYou didn\u2019t ask this, but you\u2019re also the AH for making your twins share a room simply because they\u2019re twins.

Two bathrooms between six people, one of which has to be shared between four people, another one should have been priority and was on the cards. You didn't do it because it was expensive, but managed to renovate the garage and when you came into money decided newer projects were more important. That you converted part of the garage into a laundry space indicates the space you were already using for laundry before then was open for another bathroom, a project that would have served a far more practical value than work on the backyard.", "YTA for nothing more than lying to your children. All you have done is said that your wants and desires are much more important than your children's.

Not an effing gym. I can work out anywhere, in very little space.\n\nYTA for having your priorities mixed up.", "Yeah YTA. You\u2019re literally re-doing every inch of your property except the one thing that would improve the lives of your children.", "Info: Why is the third bathroom lower priority than existing bathroom/kitchen reno and outdoor work?", "YTA for lying. It wouldn\u2019t be AH behaviour to not put in a new bathroom if you were upfront about it, but instead you lied.", "YTA \n\nSeems everything got an overhaul except what was actually needed. The backyard, really? Did you build an outhouse and an outdoor shower?", "YTA. the kids have every right to be upset because YOU said you\u2019re going to do it and keep pushing it down the list. If you don\u2019t want to do it, just say that so that they know the truth.", "YTA. Improving the lives of your children should have been first on the list when you came into money, not fifth. Your kids are old enough that they will remember how selfish you were.", "YTA, a gym is more important that a room for your daughter or a bathroom so all of your chip live more comfortably. I won\u2019t be surprised if all your children stop talking to you and your husband when they move out of your home", "YTA. You have two kids sharing a room, but though a gym and an office was more important? I\u2019d be absolutely livid if I was your children.", "YTA renovating the existing bathrooms and kitchen those are understandable and acceptable.  Moving the laundry room to the garage that\u2019s normal and not much of a renovation.  Putting gym equipment in the garage really isn\u2019t a renovation just deciding how much of the garage is the gym.  The home office in the garage is putting up a few walls which isn\u2019t a hard DIY project. \n\nSo the expense went to the bathrooms and kitchen.  Now the real issue is why the backyard is more important than renovating the old laundry room now that it no longer has a purpose.  Even the smallest of laundry rooms could fit a shower stall, toilet and sink with a cabinet maybe even a linen closet.  The biggest expense would be the plumbing.  Keep in mind a third bathroom will up the value of the house and add to the livable space that moving the laundry room afforded.\n\nThe backyard renovation could be a work in progress that is depending on the renovations.  Are they planning on a pool with a waterfall, hot tub and an outdoor kitchen?  Now that would take quite a bit of funds.\nSo renovating the garage is a budget friendly renovation done with little knowledge and an electrician.", "YTA. \n\nLots of people live in much smaller accommodations then you and your children, so sharing a bathroom and/or a bedroom isn't a big deal. \n\nHowever, you promised them another bathroom for \"awhile\" and yet you got around to doing something just for your husband and something just for you, then more stuff around the house, and maybe now you will do what you have been promising. \n\nWhen you tell your children you will do something, they rely on you to do that. When they see that you aren't keeping your promise, it hurts them. In this case, you could have told them no, but instead you said \"yes, later\" and said it was because it was expensive. You didn't say,  \"later, after X, Y, Z\" and your children see you prioritizing you and your husband over them. Now you have a room and a bathroom just for the parents, you each have an extra room for your own personal use (office and gym) and didn't even bother to talk to your kids about the order of things and can't imagine why they are upset when there are 4 of them sharing 1 bathroom and 2 sharing a room. \n\nIt is clear to your kids that you don't keep your word, and you will put you and your husband's wants over theirs. So this isn't about them being entitled kids, this about you being selfish and your kids calling you out for it.", "Why do they not just use your bathroom?

Surely the $$$ spent on gym/office/ laundry room/backyard should have been prioritized for the entirely reasonable , long requested third bathroom for your children.  \n\n\nI can't imagine the difficulty 4 ppl, let alone four teenagers face, sharing one bathroom. How do they manage getting ready for school? You said you would convert the laundry room, and flat out lied to them! Didn't you have the ability to do laundry Before? Here's an idea, have the twins share the bathroom with you and husband for six months, see how you like it. Or give your bathroom to three daughters on a rotation of several months, you and your husband troop down the hall and share with the third child, rotating fairly every four months.

Since then, I have spent well over $5,000 just in drainage improvements, soil berms, and below-grade water detention to keep water away from my house and my foundation but also to not erode my yard away and damage my foundation that way.

About 3 months after the roof repair was done that I found out that there was some \\*serious\\* pre-existing damage to my pier-and-beam foundation, and turns out I was *incredibly fucking lucky* that when the tree fell it only punched a whole in my roof and didn't cause my house to collapse and kill people....and that tree fell on a clear night without a hurricane to help it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I saw in another reply what the backyard stuff is....and OP is TA.
