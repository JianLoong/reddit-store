I\u2019m getting married in a month and I\u2019ve had some drama with my cousin and cannot figure out if I messed up or not. \n\nMy cousin Kelly is 44, 10 years older than me, and she had a daughter, Eva, late 2019 who just turned 3. For the last 2+ years Kelly has been really flaky and rude when I come to town, and I\u2019ve bent over backwards to make sure I get to see her and Eva. Also worth noting is that Kelly has some serious mental health issues that are most likely untreated at this time. I always thought Kelly would be a bridesmaid for me, but given how she\u2019s treated me for the last few years, I decided I didn\u2019t want her standing with me on my big day. \n\nMy best friend has a 5-year old daughter who is like a niece to me, so I chose her to be my flower girl. It never even occurred to me to make Eva a flower girl, as I\u2019ve only met her three times and she doesn\u2019t know me. \n\nWell, this caused Kelly to absolutely lose her mind to the point where we couldn\u2019t even rationally talk it out because she approached it by texting and telling me how awful I am and not only ending my relationship with me, but with my entire family. There is a lot more to this story, but I think I was an easy thing to direct her anger at and ended up being the scapegoat for a lot of perceived wrongdoings by my family (for example, my mom not being willing to risk getting covid to come fawn over Eva in person throughout 2020).\n\nEveryone has assured me I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and I\u2019ve believed it until a week ago when my aunt (Kelly\u2019s mom) said she won\u2019t be coming to my wedding. She said it\u2019s because of money so I offered to pay for her flight. I accidentally got emotional and told her I was afraid that it was because she was mad about Kelly and Eva not being in the wedding. She told me she is really hurt that her granddaughter Eva is not my flower girl but that she understands that I have my reasons for deciding against Eva. I tried to discuss it but she shut me down (she and my mom were raised to sweep everything under the rug). \n\nMy aunt is a perfectly normal, rational person unlike Kelly, and since she\u2019s upset with me, I\u2019m afraid that I did mess up and that I am TA. I need outside opinions.

But she\u2019s not *acting* on them by getting mad or angry at you or trying to change/manipulate the situation, because she is, like you said, a rational person that understands the couple gets to choose who participates in and who is invited to their wedding.

You did nothing wrong. She is just behaving badly. Make sure that if and when you see Eva, you are extra nice to her. That way if your cousin ever said anything bad about you, Eva might start questioning her judgment. Eva eventually needs to know her mom is not to be trusted completely. Eva will probably have a tough life for a while so being nice to her will help her see what normalcy should look like. But that really has nothing to do with the wedding. She's three, she won't care.\n\nYour aunt is probably just upset about the entire situation and upset about her daughter, and maybe isn't handling it very well. Sometimes people who are really stressed out will enable other people in order to try to keep the peace. It sounds like she's doing that with her own daughter because she's realized that her own daughter will make life worse for her than you will. So you should do the same thing with your aunt. Be extra nice to her to really highlight how awful Kelly is being. It's a little bit manipulative, but it's a good strategy.", "Nta, you aren't close to Eva.
