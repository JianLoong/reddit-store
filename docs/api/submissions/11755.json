She was released about a week later and put on probation. She broke her probation because she was caught with more marijuana. She was put back in jail for a couple of months. Throughout the whole time I called her and sent her money for the commissary. After a couple of months, she was released and put on parole. Eventually she started smoking again and found ways around passing her drug tests. I think her PO just didn\u2019t care. \n\nShe ended up meeting a guy and they both decided they wanted to have a baby. She got pregnant and ended up telling everyone that the pregnancy was an accident, including her mom and stepdad. (Sidenote: we share the same biological father, different mothers. We\u2019ve never met him, he has no interest. We\u2019ve never met each other in person. We just found out about each other in 2017.) \n\nAbout six months into the pregnancy she got a new PO and the first thing they did was drug test her and she came up positive and a warrant went out for her arrest. She was arrested and put into a county jail while she waited to be transferred to a prison. The jail started to get overcrowded and Covid was spreading quickly so the judge let her out but made the terms of her parol harsher than before. She was eight months pregnant at this point. She started smoking again. Her PO wasn\u2019t drug testing her.\n\nShe gave birth a few weeks early to a baby boy and the staff at the hospital tested.. I believe the urine, blood and feces. His poop came back with traces of Marijuana. CPS got involved in the case. My sister wasn\u2019t arrested immediately. I was angry with her at this point. She was risking everything. She got pregnant on purpose. Without a job, no financial stability. She was putting her child at risk. \n\nWhen my nephew was about two months old my sister was arrested and sent to prison. She was there eleven months. I talked to her at first but eventually I stopped answering her calls. She kept asking for money because she wanted to buy new makeup because she didn\u2019t feel pretty. She was suffering from postpartum depression. I didn\u2019t have a job or any money. She wanted me to video chat guys that were in the same prison as her and show them the hottest pictures I could find of her off her Facebook profile. I think she wanted to feel wanted again. I told her I felt uncomfortable video chatting guys in prison I didn\u2019t know and it felt like she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\n\nMy mom says I\u2019m being a stuck up bitch because I abandoned her when she needed me most and that I\u2019m acting like our biological father. She says that she missed out on seeing her sons first steps, first birthday, first words. I understand where she\u2019s coming from but I still feel so angry with the whole situation and it\u2019s hard to let go of. I feel like I\u2019m still being stand offish when she calls.

At a certain point, you have to stop enabling someone who keeps making the same bad choices over and over again. And to be clear, they\u2019re not mistakes anymore. They\u2019re flat out poor choices. \n\nYour sister has no one but herself to blame for missing her kid\u2019s milestones. Hopefully this turns into a wake up call soon and she stops blaming you. I\u2019m sorry you and your family are going through this, OP.", "NTA. Your mom and sister are though. Your sister missed out on those things because she fucked around and found out. She had plenty of opportunities to put the weed down long enough to get through the legal issues, but decided not to. She is her own enemy and you OWE HER NOTHING.", "NTA \n\nYou can't make your sister get her life together. She is still not putting her child first. It honestly sounds like she needs therapy. You need to do what's best for yourself. You can't fix her.", "NTA. Your sister sounds very irresponsible for having a child when she was in no way prepared to be a mother. She is still being selfish and only seems to care about her appearance. It\u2019s certainly not your responsibility to help her get dates with prison guys.", "NTA by any means. Tell your mother that SHE can video chat guys in prison to show off hot pictures of your sister. Your sister has made her own bed, many times over, and now she needs to sleep in it, that is deal with the consequences for herself. \n\nIt's not your job to \"make her feel pretty\" (nor was it the job of the illegal drugs she took).", "She didn't \"miss out\" on seeing her son's firsts. That implies that she had no choice. She chose to prioritize her own whims over seeing those firsts.\n\nYou don't know this woman. You met her, what? 6 years ago? And she would have been 18? \n\n2 years later she was in jail. She lied and used you for money for months. \n\nThen she chose to have a baby and lie about it to do what? \n\nShe then used recreational (illegal) drugs while pregnant *while* on probation for the same thing.\n\nNow she's not asking you for help with... idk... a friend to talk to, or mementos from her child's firsts... she's asking you for money for non-essentials and to... video chat male prisoners to... pimp her out?\n\nSomeone's priorities are messed up... and that someone isn't you.\n\nI'm not sure why your mom is involved at all, but her priorities are screwed too.\n\nAlso... I'm not a doctor but... this doesn't sound like PPD to me. \n\nAnyway, NTA but good luck navigating this. And I hope your little nephew is safe.", "NTA but damn it\u2019s kind of crazy that she\u2019s not getting sent to court ordered rehab and instead gets sent to jail each time for smoking marijuana. Like how is this cost effective for the state? It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s committed any violent crimes or anything. No wonder the jails are overcrowded if you can get sent there for the consumption and possession of the drug in question.", "NTA. It's completely fine for your sister to have asked for help initially, but she should also have done her part to help herself out of her situation - which she clearly didn't do and don't plan on doing anytime soon. Don't feel guilty for slowly cutting her off, you've done your part.", "NTA-\n\nOne you don't have the money to give. So no guilt there. Next she has made poor decision after poor decision and this is the life she has chosen. The fact she wants you to video chat with felons to get her some source of desire is bizarre. \n\nAlso your mom, why doesn't she help her? Family or not nobody should sacrifice their own happiness and well-being for another person.", "NTA. It\u2019s creepy she wants you to video chat other prisoners. Not your job to take care of her. Not your job to send her money. She didn\u2019t make one bad decision. She kept making them. She choose to make one bad decision after another. It\u2019s not your job to fix those mad mistakes for her.", "NTA.  You need to take care of yourself before you can help anyone else.  I hope you are working now.  Remove yourself from toxic people, including your sister.  Your mom is not giving you good advice, but I think you know that.\n\nDon't feel guilty.  You did not put your sister into the position she is in.  She had plenty of opportunities to do better but she put marijuana before the health of her baby and her freedom.  This is a consequence of her actions.", "NTA. You are entitled to set your own boundaries and decide whom you accept phone calls from as well as how you spend your money. It isn\u2019t like she is calling just to talk and see how you are doing. From what you have described, it is all one-sided and the reason for her calls is all about what you can do for her. IMHO you didn\u2019t abandon her, you are establishing boundaries on how you expect to be treated. Good for you!", "NTA. Your sister knew that continuing to use could have consequences, but she chose to keep doing it. Your mom is just trying to guilt-trip you, but she shouldn\u2019t. Your sister wasn\u2019t looking for emotional support from you, she was looking to use you to get things she wanted.", "NTA.\n\nSome people just have to learn things the hard way.", "NTA and you should go no contact with her for good", "Sounds like Alabama.  With the chemical endangerment  testing. However, NTA your sister made choices. The only innocent person is the child. Stand your ground. She will keep doing this until she is in for a long time or she wakes up and decides to get help. I hope the baby is safe.", "NTA You\u2019ve never met her, and she only keeps in touch with you because she wants things from you. She\u2019s a total user, and you\u2019re way better off without her. Your mom\u2019s take is baffling.", "NTA. Your sister and mom are being abusive towards you. The fact that she\u2019s asking you to video chat with men in prison that you do not know, to serve a purpose for her? Disgusting.", "NTA.    \n\nBut why doesn\u2019t your sister move to a State where weed is legal, or at least decriminalized?!   \n\nWtf she is destroying any chance at a life for herself.    She needed to move three arrests ago.", "NTA - for Pete's sake.", "Your sister missed out on her son\u2019s milestones because she was abusing drugs and it affected the damn baby. Tell your mother that you aren\u2019t your sister\u2019s keeper and that she only had herself to blame. You said that the father is taking care of the baby and he is doing a good job\u2014I hope that he has full custody even when your sister gets out. \n\nAlso if anything if your dad is a deadbeat (I\u2019m not sure if he is but assuming from your mom\u2019s response I think he is) so is your sister.

Your mom can send money if she wants.", "Why are you speaking to someone you hate so much ?", "NTA but I don't agreed with people here saying you sister made her choice. The state failed her in the first time they arrested her and everything that came after that is a consequence of that, the moment you get in the system, there is not going back, your life is change forever and take an amount of support and will to tourn around. \n\nNo one should be arrested because smoke marijuana.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It would probably help more", "The baby is safe. He is actually very healthy. And I think they only did the testing because of my sisters last drug usage. She\u2019s actually not in Alabama", "After the first arrest, I tried to convince her that she should just make it through her probation and move somewhere where it is legal. She wanted to go to school for cosmetology and I believe she could have gotten loans, but then she became a felon when she started breaking the terms of her parole and probation.

It is not just the fact that she was smoking it, but the fact that she violated her probation and parole terms repeatedly", "Because back in 2017 when we first met we made a connection because we were both abandoned and threw away like trash by our biological father. It was a commonality between us. I guess I wasn\u2019t ready to let that go. And I don\u2019t hate her. I don\u2019t hate anyone.", "The father takes care of the baby mostly.
