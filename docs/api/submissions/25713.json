{"id": 25713, "submission_id": "163ncwa", "title": "AITA for not wanting to give up my man cave?", "selftext": "My wife and I have a 4 month old and will be trying for a second baby soon. We have a 3 bedroom house and one of the rooms is my \"man cave\" (aka all the crap my wife doesn't want strewn about).\n\nLast night she said when the second baby is born we'll need to have the man cave converted into baby room #2, and my things will need to be put in storage until we can buy a bigger home (which realistically won't be for another 5+ years). I told her I don't think that's necessary and fully expected our babies would share a bedroom, and once they're a little older we would be ready to move to a bigger home where they could have their own rooms. She thinks I'm being unrealistic and selfish.\n\nBabies/kids share bedrooms all the time, but I do see her point. My family is my #1 priority, but at the end of the day I also need a space for myself. My wife doesn't want my collection of records, tapes, books and video games in the living room or our bedroom, so the only alternative is to put everything away in storage elsewhere. Am I being a selfish asshole for expecting that our babies/toddlers would share a bedroom for a few years just so I can keep my room?\n\nEdit: No, my wife does not necassarily have her own room, but has the whole house to do with as she pleases, while I try to keep all of my things contained to this one space.\n\nEdit#2: In defence of my wife not wanting all my stuff around the house, I totally understand and respect it. It's both our house, and she prefers things to be tidy and sparse, while I like clutter and have a lot of shit. As some commenters have pointed out, she doesn't want my records/books etc displayed in the living room or bedroom and would prefer these things go in storage, hence the issue.\n\nAs for the babies, our 4 month old sleeps peacefully through the night (and has done so since she was about 6 weeks old), and a newborn would sleep in our bedroom with us until they're also sleeping through the night before we would have them sharing a room together. I agree that an infanct waking up a toddler isn't fair, and envisioned this ony beginning once both children are sleeping through the night.\n\nI'd like to also add that this wasn't an argument between my wife and I. This was a calm conversation between the two of us, and at no point did I ever say I refused to give up my man cave. Relationships are about honest and open communication, and if you can't do so without it devolving into an argument you don't have a very healthy relationship. \n\nUltimately I admit to being selfish here and would like to find a compromise that everyone can be happy with, whether it be my records and such being stored neatly on shelves in a shared living space, or our children comfortably sleeping in the same room. If ever our toddler or my wife found the situation to be unbearable, I would give up the room in a heartbeat.", "created_utc": 1693232326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163ncwa/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_up_my_man_cave/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wanted to keep his office as family space. And he deals with classified information. So he got a locked cabinet and locked briefcase. When he needed to have things out my parents used the \u201ccone of silence\u201d rule where my sister and I where just taught to ignore what was on the desk and not go snooping. \n\nHe only closed the door when he was on a call. \n\nThere are ways for private space to still be open to the family and not fall into the \u201cman cave\u201d situation. \n\nMy dad let my mom decorate since she has an eye for it. But she never bought anything he hated. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard people. It\u2019s literally all about communication, compromising and wanting to be active parents. My dad wanted my sister and I doing our homework in his office while he read contracts at night. He wanted that time with us. \n\nThe man cave stereotype feels like a relic of an era from the show Bewitched.", "The thing is decorating a space, and the space being 'for you' are two entirely different things.  I can decorate the kitchen, but I don't want the kitchen to be 'for me'  the kitchen is a place for domestic labor.  I can't shut myself up in the kitchen and chill.  And if I decorate the living room that doesn't mean I get total control over the TV forever or I can ask my husband to leave when I need to introvert.  The living room is for all of us, but mostly the kid because it is 75% his toys.  We do have a room in the house for my husband's collection - but it is also the guest bedroom and the office and the wrapping paper room and the spare closet. No one gets dibs on that room, it is for everyone.  Getting a special all for me alone place is not the same as having a space you decorated.", "This is actually an interesting point and I think implies something your unaware of. For a bit of history. Often the public realm was considered only for men whereas the private realm was considered for women, at least as it pertains to \u201cwestern\u201d development. This goes back all the way to BCE times. In fact the development of coffee houses was done to further exclude women from the public realm starting in the 1700\u2019s and as a result women began to make salons as there weren\u2019t spaces for them to have intellectual and artistic spaces that they could participate. \n\nSo moving into post WWII modernism we see this rise in suburbia as the solution to urban problems. Thinkers like Corbusier, Ebeonezer Howard (a bit pre this time period but his manifesto on garden city movement was often referenced) CIAM, Robert Moses (particularly in his opposition to Jane Jacobs) etc. advocated not only for separation of public and private spheres but encouraged the development of commuter culture where men would go down town when their family would remain in the suburbs. So tossing over gender dynamics meant men get to leave the private sphere for the public sphere and women controlled the private sphere meant that women where relegated to have their lives be built around taking care of the home. Men as a result not only got to have an escape but then would come back where their wives and spaces would serve to let them \u201cwind down\u201d have some bucolic experiences with their families while their wife (who had done the decorating and done the work for the home) didn\u2019t get to have a break or respite and needed her whole life to revolve around making the home function. \n\nWe also in this time period see a lot of open concept homes that still section off the kitchen from the rest of the house so that women are further separated from the living space within the home. \n\nSo in society today we still have vestiges of this. And partly this comes through in spaces like the man cave. Is a more modern iteration of this concept where men are entitled to privacy and separation. Whereas women \u201cget the rest of the house\u201d which is a space they typically have to mold around the needs of the family and that represents more physical, emotional and mental labor for them. \n\nMan caves aren\u2019t harmless. And until we can within personal relationships and society at a large get rid of these systemic structures/framework it will continue to have a connotation outside of just \u201cI want a private space since you decorated\u201d \n\nAs a man you haven\u2019t had to deal with the implication. We have. It\u2019s still a problem and still exists. Your gf doesn\u2019t have personal space. It\u2019s shared. OP\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t \u201chave the rest of the house\u201d it\u2019s the family space and she has to maintain it to function for young kids. It\u2019s not a safe and fun space for her, it represents domestic labor for her. Whereas she may share those responsibilities with OP, his \u201cman cave\u201d gets to remain his escape from the family and from the domestic labor. \n\nIt\u2019s not me tossing this out Willy nilly. We literally have designed Americana suburbia after this concept. Look at the houses and the spaces we have made for this institutional ideology. It\u2019s literally baked into our system. This is why it\u2019s important we combat these narratives. Maybe someday man cave can just be a space. But it can\u2019t be that now. \n\nhttps://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100353296#:~:text=The%20public%20sphere%20is%20that,that%20of%20women%20and%20children.\n\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/95/5/052007/pdf\n\nhttps://amp.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/28/story-cities-32-new-york-jane-jacobs-robert-moses\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens_Charter#:~:text=He%20also%20presented%20supporting%20information,set%20of%20notation%20was%20agreed. \n\n(Look up the Athens Charter for CIAM their idea was to separate work from home, domestic from public) \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/254602059_Shaping_the_Public_Sphere_English_Coffeehouses_and_French_Salons_and_the_Age_of_the_Enlightenment", "Haha.

But spaces like the master bedroom for a mom where you have a baby and toddler is a key area for managing your day and potentially if she is layed up after childbirth, then the living room would be used for toys, playtime, naps, play dates, and essentially becomes a space needing to be a decluttered as possible.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he should have to put everything in storage. But I\u2019m questioning his accusation that she gets all the rest of the space may not be accurate. If they need the space for family use then it\u2019s not her space and frankly it\u2019s not his either.", "If it\u2019s in a room it could be massive. If he has an entire bookshelf or two of records and a large video game collection it could easily just be too bug, breakable or heavy to be in common areas.

And if wife is trying to keep the bedroom and living room clear to make child rearing easier (as in less cluttered and with more space for kid stuff to grow) then it\u2019s not really \u201cher\u201d space either.

It might be a sparser style (which makes sense with children), but I'm going to guess that most of the stuff in the house isn't hers, or if it's \"hers\" it actually benefits the whole family. Like the kitchen might be \"her\" space except she needs the stuff in it to cook to feed her family every day. Or the living room might be \"her\" space except that it has to be child-safe and maintained in a way where everyone can spend time there everyday, because everyone spends time there everyday. Same for their shared bedroom.\n\nThe OP is fine to push for more of his style to be incorporated into the whole home but it sounds like he is the primary and probably only user of the \"man cave\". So she gets a whole house full of stuff that is in her taste but primarily intended for the whole family to use and/or benefit from. That's not actually her space or her stuff.", "But is her stuff all over the house, or is he referring to her decorating? Does the wife have a CD collection that is in the living room?

But there is an immense amount of literature on this topic. I had to study it for my degree as an architect.

Literally the idea that \u201cwomen are in charge of the home\u201d was made to keep women in the home like property. The whole \u201cwomen design the home and all I want is one room\u201d is a misnomer because the implication is that the home somehow represents rest for everyone. It just doesn\u2019t.

That's not how humans who cohabit well  together behave. We behave in ways by following the social contract we agree on.   I say forbid in regards to the gym because we use it to workout in - and if there's stuff on the mats in front of the TV I then have to move it which annoys the person who put it there because they then can't find it. So we mutually agree - I don't mess the garage or workshop up because he's the one who uses his tools and gets upset if he can't find his nails/drilll/etc and I don't like having to spend 30 minutes cleaning the gym area.
