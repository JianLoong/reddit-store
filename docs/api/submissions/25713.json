{"id": 25713, "submission_id": "163ncwa", "title": "AITA for not wanting to give up my man cave?", "selftext": "My wife and I have a 4 month old and will be trying for a second baby soon. We have a 3 bedroom house and one of the rooms is my \"man cave\" (aka all the crap my wife doesn't want strewn about).\n\nLast night she said when the second baby is born we'll need to have the man cave converted into baby room #2, and my things will need to be put in storage until we can buy a bigger home (which realistically won't be for another 5+ years). I told her I don't think that's necessary and fully expected our babies would share a bedroom, and once they're a little older we would be ready to move to a bigger home where they could have their own rooms. She thinks I'm being unrealistic and selfish.\n\nBabies/kids share bedrooms all the time, but I do see her point. My family is my #1 priority, but at the end of the day I also need a space for myself. My wife doesn't want my collection of records, tapes, books and video games in the living room or our bedroom, so the only alternative is to put everything away in storage elsewhere. Am I being a selfish asshole for expecting that our babies/toddlers would share a bedroom for a few years just so I can keep my room?\n\nEdit: No, my wife does not necassarily have her own room, but has the whole house to do with as she pleases, while I try to keep all of my things contained to this one space.\n\nEdit#2: In defence of my wife not wanting all my stuff around the house, I totally understand and respect it. It's both our house, and she prefers things to be tidy and sparse, while I like clutter and have a lot of shit. As some commenters have pointed out, she doesn't want my records/books etc displayed in the living room or bedroom and would prefer these things go in storage, hence the issue.\n\nAs for the babies, our 4 month old sleeps peacefully through the night (and has done so since she was about 6 weeks old), and a newborn would sleep in our bedroom with us until they're also sleeping through the night before we would have them sharing a room together. I agree that an infanct waking up a toddler isn't fair, and envisioned this ony beginning once both children are sleeping through the night.\n\nI'd like to also add that this wasn't an argument between my wife and I. This was a calm conversation between the two of us, and at no point did I ever say I refused to give up my man cave. Relationships are about honest and open communication, and if you can't do so without it devolving into an argument you don't have a very healthy relationship. \n\nUltimately I admit to being selfish here and would like to find a compromise that everyone can be happy with, whether it be my records and such being stored neatly on shelves in a shared living space, or our children comfortably sleeping in the same room. If ever our toddler or my wife found the situation to be unbearable, I would give up the room in a heartbeat.", "created_utc": 1693232326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163ncwa/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_up_my_man_cave/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And if you get a man cave your wife gets a woman cave.", ">My wife doesn't want my collection of records, tapes, books and video games in the living room or our bedroom\n\nThis.  This is how my house operates too, my wife pretty much gets the entire home, decorates, makes things in their place, and enjoys her shows on the tv and I use the office, it seems OP has a similar setup.  She doesn't want me playing video games on the living room TV, she wants to watch her shows and sit on the couch.  I think that is pretty normal.", "It sounds like it's the entire house except the man cave.", "The only reason he has a private space to begin with is because his wife will not allow him to use their shared space. That's obviously the only possible compromise you can arrive at when your SO will not allow you to share space with them.", "This right here.", "yeah. i agree it's reasonable to go- some of my stuff should be able to go in common areas of the house. i get that my style isn't your style but it isn't your space, it's our space. (though they do have small kids. it's really the kids space.)\n\nbut the key there is some. and realistically, in this imaginary world were this is necessary- they're going to have 2 under 3. how much use OP would get out of any of those things until they get the new house is really questionable. \n\nand that's before we get into can they store them in their current space in a way that is child safe because OP isn't going to want the kids getting into and destroying those items. they may just be safer stored away for now.", "He said in the post that he see's the point about vacating the bedroom but the issue is obviously that his wife wants him to put his stuff into storage and he'd rather keep it around in a shared living space. She's the one with the \"I won't give up my space\" attitude.", "Then his wife can give up some space in the rest of the house for his stuff.", "Niether are willing to give up thier space", ">Does your wife have an area for her to have space and put her things\n\nYes, per the OP she has the entire house except for one room.", "This is the crux of it man.", "Newborns sleep in the parents' room, you're not supposed to put babies in their own room for at least a few months.", "Post literally says man cave exists because wife doesn\u2019t want his shit elsewhere. She literally wants him to put it all in storage instead of make room for it in the common areas.", "Doesn't matter. She's saying \"Take your personal belongings and put them in storage\" that's an AH move. Maybe she doesn't have as much hobby items because her hobby is running or something. This 1 for 1 \"wHaT AbOuT HeR sPaCe?\" is such a dumb response.", "the problem is baby crying and waking up the toddler, resulting in 2 sleep deprived, crying kids.", "Sounds like the wife doesn't want his stuff in the house at all, how is that on OP?\n\nAlso, OP isn't denying the kids space entirely; kids don't need separate bedrooms to survive.", ">man the fuck up\n\nToxic masculinity remains...", "A new baby should be sleeping in a crib in the same room as the parents.", "\"it will help them bond.\" is in fact not a fact.", "I think it depends. I shared a room with my sister (2 years younger) until I was about 12, and I don't have 1 single f to give about her. None. 0. My other sister, however, I care greatly for, and she is 11 years older. We never room shared.", "The problem with babies/toddler in the same room is that a baby wakes up a lot. And when you go to care for them, you wake up your toddler and then have to care for them too. \n\nAnd if by miracle the toddler didn't wake up, then you have to do everything in low light and on tiptoes so you don't wake him up. \n\nAnd you get a cranky sleep deprived toddler. \n\nIt just makes it way harder for everyone.", "Lol. Two siblings can share a room if needed but it is far more difficult at night and for nap time as they have different rythms. So clearly his family is not his priority here.", "My husband and I have different interests. My video game setup is in one room  and our DvDs are in a case. All our books are on book shelves. The garage is his domain for tools and he has a tool workshop which is like a garage attached shed. The basement is our gym and I forbid anyone from putting crap in the space that inhibits workouts. That said we agree together on where our stuff [is](https://is.You) You have to talk to each other and agree on where things go if you plan on having another child", "Yep my wife gets the entire house to do whatever she wants. I just want one corner of one room. She tried too take that too. But I told her that would be a massive deal breaker for me.\n\nGenerally this is how it is in all my friends relationships also.\n\nI have a feeling the wife is not at all interested in compromising on how the rest of the house is set up if her first assumption is to throw all his stuff into storage, and not just another part of the house.", "Really? Sounds like she doesn\u2019t have one at all.", "Not really private then is it?", "Who said she forced him? Maybe he just wanted a man cave? Maybe they mutually agreed when they first bought the house?", "Hahaha you are right,  op will probably quickly discover that he does not actually want his stuff stored on any shelf the kids can reach. Nothing funner to a baby than pulling shit off shelves.", "Is she though? I mean from how this is written it comes off that way. But I think I\u2019ll reserve judgment until we get an idea of what kind of collection we are talking about. \n\nI know a lot of people who love music particularly who have extensive record collections that are delicate and take up a bunch of space. \n\nI also know that babies take up a lot of living space. So in a living room there\u2019s likely toys, items that contribute to baby care. \n\nSo I would be interested to know what kind of amount of stuff we are talking about. I mean if it would take up a shelf or two then that\u2019s ridiculous to not make the space. If it would mean getting a media cabinet then what\u2019s the problem. But if it\u2019s a massive amount of stuff that would take over and that just will make the living room and bedroom completely cluttered and unusable then I kind of see her point. Also how much hobby stuff does she get to have around. Is the house filled with her things or is \u201cher space\u201d really family space that includes spaces for baby and husband and it\u2019s therefore not really hers. \n\nBoth my parents have things in storage. It\u2019s in their basement but my dad has a bin of trophies and baseball cards and my mom has a bunch of keepsakes in a big bin too. People put things in storage all the time.", "It is not her space exclusively, it is family space. She doesn\u2019t have a room to herself for her personal things. If she had a crafting room it would be different, but she doesn\u2019t.", "It is not her space exclusively, it is family space. She doesn\u2019t have a room to herself for her personal things.

It's not a guarantee, unfortunately.  I never specified exactly when they would be in the same room, though.", "This was my thought. My kids had separate rooms. I couldn't imagine having them in the same room hoping they didn't wake each other up all night.", "100%.  We never put youngest in with oldest", "If his wife doesn't let him decorate with anything, then it's her house. Again, that's his side of the story. I'm just going with what's written.", "If you dominate the rest of the house then you can give up one room.", "She's the one who wouldn't compromise, though, and per his story, wouldn't allow his things around the house. She sacrificed private by consuming the entire home and not allowing him anything but the one room.\nLOL you're all really trying to act like he demanded the man cave when all he wanted was to keep his things.", "Yes a man cave is a great compromise when you're in a situation like this. Also, by definition she forced him by \"not allowing him to use the shared space\". Even if he actually did want it and volunteered to have a man cave, by definition he has no other choice if he wants to actually keep his stuff.", "Is she willing to compromise on how the rest of the house is set up?\n\nHer forcing all of his things into storage suggests no.", "I agree if we're talking about a significant collection obviously OP would have to probably put some of it in storage and then rotate it around every so often. But if his entire collection is confined to a single bedroom right now it's probably not that massive.", "A lot of people don't heed that advice! Lol! A woman's body needs that time to recover!", "The room isn't being given up for her, it would be for their future child.", "She dominates the rest of the house because she doesn't have her own room. Obviously it's around the house. If she had her own room it would be there and not everywhere else.\n\nSaying that I don't agree with the storage part. She has to make space around the house now.", "Well his title literally says \"not wanting to give up my man cave.\" So..", "This reads like \"putting 2 rooms worth of stuff in one room is no big deal\".", "I would think the collection was massive because it has its own room.", "A hypothetical child that doesn't exist that they haven't even got pregnant with. You're reaching a bit.", "This is one reason I hate the term \"man cave\" -- if this was a \"game room\" or a \"library\" or even a den or office we'd need more of a reason than \"I have stuff\" for him to hang on to it. Ditto if they he had a crafting or sewing room. It would obviously become a room for the new kid.\n\nThe rest of the house that is \"her space\"? That she's supposedly dominating? What are we talking about? A place to eat, a place to cook, a place to wash up and a space where you invite people in or sit and watch tv/read/whatever in. Those spaces don't \"belong\" to her just because she's resisted making them homes to a bunch of stuff that's not for universal use. But \"Man Cave\" has all these connotations that lead to these \"I have a right to have this space because it's for my MAN-NESS!\" that really feeds into the idea that the rest of the house is \"hers\" and not shared space.", "Okay then she should have a conversation about having her own space then.", "And the conversation reads that the wife is consuming the entire home and now wants to shove his stuff in storage for an imaginary child that doesn't exist. That's what reading is for, to get the context of the story. Really taking this personal, I see.", "Its not wrong to have these conversations in advance though. Wife said \"**when** the second child is born..\" She is just starting the conversation early so they have a plan set, it's actually responsible that she brought it up now rather than wait til the kid arrives.\n\nI also agree though that she should compromise and allow him to have more of his things in the communal space though.", "Do you think if they had enough room for that they would be having this issue now?", "I think the only butthurt one here is you..", "You got all that context from that? Okay, well, it reads to me that the wife is demanding not conversing. Since you wanted to manipulate it in your favor, I will, too. In what world does a person who's living in a home, paying for it, sharing in all of its responsibility, not have a place for his things that he enjoys?", "I already agreed that he should be able to bring his items into the communal space."]}
