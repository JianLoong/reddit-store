This is my third year renting, and her first time leaving home, where she lived in a small apartment with her mom, where she didn\u2019t have wifi or modern tv or most modern technology. \n\nWe have been living in the house for a month, and my roommate\u2019s mom has been coming over almost every night. Sometimes she will stay for an hour; sometimes six. She helps herself to using all of our things such as our Wifi, our smart tv, our air fryer, all our dishes and leaving them in a mess for us to clean, etc. She has also been frequently bringing her boyfriend, and sometimes even his friends. My roommate never tells me if they are coming over and I often come home from work to find them in my living room. What\u2019s even more frustrating for me is I\u2019d say about eighty percent of the things we have are actually mine too; things I gathered over the first two years I was renting, but I barely find time to use them as her mom and her boyfriend are using them at times when I would want to myself. \n\n\nI get trapped in conversation with her mom when I don\u2019t feel like talking to anyone and just want to chill every night I come home and they\u2019re there. I work long shifts, 10-12 hour days, and it is very frustrating when I have been looking forward to chilling and watching tv but my roommate\u2019s mom and her boyfriend have their feet up on the coffee table watching tv with a plate full of food they cooked in the air fryer. Sometimes my roommate isn\u2019t even with them and is just in her room. \n\nAITA if I ask my roommate if she came over less? I\u2019m not sure how to ask her without seeming insensitive; her and her mom are very close as it has just been them most of their lives. I have been thinking about asking her if they could just come over once or twice a week and spend the other nights at their place.

Reassure her you're not banning her mother, but she needs to lay off with daily visits and using your things. A once per week visit should suffice - obviously it's harder for her having never lived apart from her mother, but it doesn't sound like she does now ... \n\nNTA", "'This a shared space and you, your mother and her friends are taking up too much of it and for too long. You need to curtail her visits to 1/2 a week maximum and let me know before hand when she is coming. If she plans on bringing friends then you run it past me first'\n\nThis is how you get what you want. No explanations, no apology, no justifications. Just state your boundary.\n\nIt's up to your room mate how she takes it. That's how boundaries work. If she can't deal or if she argue against it, then she has to go.\n\nYour peace and your well being is as important as her entertaining.\n\nI have NO idea how you've been putting up with this. It's my idea of a living hell.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Establish boundaries or expectations for your roommate when they have ANY guests over. A decent human will not argue with being asked to act decently.", "Nta\u2026set boundaries.   Your roommate is letting mom basically live with you on your dime.  If she needs to see mom so much, she can go over there. Is she home all the time?  If not, you can tell them they need to leave.  They can only be there when daughter is there.  And let her clean up their mess.  Tell roomie if this does not change, when lease is up, you will be seeking a new roommate.", "NTA, and you need to nip this in the bud now! Tell your roommate point blank that visitors need to be limited in how often they visit how long they stay, they may never be there if she's not and they are not to touch any of your things. Normally, I wouldn't be so militant right off the bat, but if you don't stop this now, they will take over. They clearly have no concept of boundaries.", "NTA. Stand up for yourself and tell her everything you wrote on this post. If she doesn't like it find a new flatmate.", "As someone who works 10 hour shifts I cannot imagine how frustrating this would be for me! You are absolutely not the a-hole! Please say something!", "Mom should NOT be at YOUR apt. She should NOT be bringing HER bf over either. You need to be firm and fast about this. She should NOT have a key. This is serious sh\\*t.", "Don\u2019t do this, there\u2019s a small chance she\u2019d agree and then her mom feels she has a right to the space. She needs to be firm and tell her that her mom can\u2019t come over unannounced and definitely can\u2019t bring her boyfriend and friends", "Yeah, I have no issue with her coming over once or twice a week, but at the moment it is like six. And she\u2019s using our dishes and not washing them every night, watching tv for hours every night so I can\u2019t use it, and talking loudly sometimes until midnight or 1am.", "Yeah it has been pretty awful for me. I\u2019m quite an introverted person, and I actually chose this friend to live with because we had talked prior about how we wouldn\u2019t have people over too often and when we did we would let the other know. So I\u2019m feeling pretty let down by her. And when her mom isn\u2019t here she often has a guy over anyway.", "Yeah\u2026 I mean my roommate does invite her often but I think sometimes even my roommate doesn\u2019t want her there\u2026 I think her mom is just coming over to use our things that she doesn\u2019t have herself.", "Asking her if you can talk about / write out expectations around guests together so you're on the same page, might be a good way to approach it. Asking her how often she'd like to have people over could give her a lightbulb moment about how suggesting 6 out loud might be a little ridiculous. Or maybe it's the mother who has been pushing to come over, and she ciuld use an opportnity to talk to you about polite ways to deflect her: either by going out sometimes, or how to say no / suggest a rain check.\n\nIf she's fairly set on having the mother over more than half the days of the week, then talking about expectations around cleaning up might be the discussion to have. Maybe mum can clean up right before she goes, especially if she has a little help (supervision), especially from your roommate, to prompt her or put the clean dishes where they need to go.\n\nFor the things that are things that are yours, can you move any of them into your room? I know moving the air fryer could cause a fuss, but I'm unsure what the other items are. Maybe you could ask they clean the air fryer if they use it, especially if they're resistant to cleaning dishes, as a compromise.\n\nOverall, NTA, your needs are important. I sincerely wish you luck in navigating the conversation, because ghat situation would have me burnt out!", "Sad that she doesn\u2019t hold to her word. I would try to talk to her again and be strict without being rude, let her know that this is not what you agreed upon. Is very possible this will ruin your friendship down the line if you don\u2019t talk to her now.", "That sure sounds right. Mom seems entitled."]}
