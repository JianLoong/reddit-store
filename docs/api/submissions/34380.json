Sometimes she will stay for an hour; sometimes six. She helps herself to using all of our things such as our Wifi, our smart tv, our air fryer, all our dishes and leaving them in a mess for us to clean, etc. She has also been frequently bringing her boyfriend, and sometimes even his friends. My roommate never tells me if they are coming over and I often come home from work to find them in my living room. What\u2019s even more frustrating for me is I\u2019d say about eighty percent of the things we have are actually mine too; things I gathered over the first two years I was renting, but I barely find time to use them as her mom and her boyfriend are using them at times when I would want to myself. \n\n\nI get trapped in conversation with her mom when I don\u2019t feel like talking to anyone and just want to chill every night I come home and they\u2019re there. I work long shifts, 10-12 hour days, and it is very frustrating when I have been looking forward to chilling and watching tv but my roommate\u2019s mom and her boyfriend have their feet up on the coffee table watching tv with a plate full of food they cooked in the air fryer. Sometimes my roommate isn\u2019t even with them and is just in her room. \n\nAITA if I ask my roommate if she came over less? I\u2019m not sure how to ask her without seeming insensitive; her and her mom are very close as it has just been them most of their lives.

Reassure her you're not banning her mother, but she needs to lay off with daily visits and using your things. A once per week visit should suffice - obviously it's harder for her having never lived apart from her mother, but it doesn't sound like she does now ... \n\nNTA", "'This a shared space and you, your mother and her friends are taking up too much of it and for too long.

Just state your boundary.\n\nIt's up to your room mate how she takes it. That's how boundaries work. If she can't deal or if she argue against it, then she has to go.\n\nYour peace and your well being is as important as her entertaining.\n\nI have NO idea how you've been putting up with this.

If she needs to see mom so much, she can go over there. Is she home all the time?  If not, you can tell them they need to leave.  They can only be there when daughter is there.  And let her clean up their mess.  Tell roomie if this does not change, when lease is up, you will be seeking a new roommate.", "NTA, and you need to nip this in the bud now! Tell your roommate point blank that visitors need to be limited in how often they visit how long they stay, they may never be there if she's not and they are not to touch any of your things.

And she\u2019s using our dishes and not washing them every night, watching tv for hours every night so I can\u2019t use it, and talking loudly sometimes until midnight or 1am.", "Yeah it has been pretty awful for me. I\u2019m quite an introverted person, and I actually chose this friend to live with because we had talked prior about how we wouldn\u2019t have people over too often and when we did we would let the other know. So I\u2019m feeling pretty let down by her. And when her mom isn\u2019t here she often has a guy over anyway.", "Yeah\u2026 I mean my roommate does invite her often but I think sometimes even my roommate doesn\u2019t want her there\u2026 I think her mom is just coming over to use our things that she doesn\u2019t have herself.", "Asking her if you can talk about / write out expectations around guests together so you're on the same page, might be a good way to approach it. Asking her how often she'd like to have people over could give her a lightbulb moment about how suggesting 6 out loud might be a little ridiculous. Or maybe it's the mother who has been pushing to come over, and she ciuld use an opportnity to talk to you about polite ways to deflect her: either by going out sometimes, or how to say no / suggest a rain check.\n\nIf she's fairly set on having the mother over more than half the days of the week, then talking about expectations around cleaning up might be the discussion to have. Maybe mum can clean up right before she goes, especially if she has a little help (supervision), especially from your roommate, to prompt her or put the clean dishes where they need to go.\n\nFor the things that are things that are yours, can you move any of them into your room? I know moving the air fryer could cause a fuss, but I'm unsure what the other items are. Maybe you could ask they clean the air fryer if they use it, especially if they're resistant to cleaning dishes, as a compromise.\n\nOverall, NTA, your needs are important. I sincerely wish you luck in navigating the conversation, because ghat situation would have me burnt out!", "Sad that she doesn\u2019t hold to her word. I would try to talk to her again and be strict without being rude, let her know that this is not what you agreed upon. Is very possible this will ruin your friendship down the line if you don\u2019t talk to her now.", "That sure sounds right. Mom seems entitled.", "NTA.  Invite your own mother over much more often.  Also (and I say this gently), look into assertiveness classes for yourself.  You know this isn't decent behaviour, you know her mum & BF are overstepping big time\u2014you're the one who needs the courage to say, \"move off the sofa, it's my sofa, my tv, my coffee table, I pay to live here, get the f out.\"", "Talk to your room mate, explain that one or two nights a week is suitable for her mum to visit otherwise she can go and visit her mum for the extra nights.\n\nI would also start making comments to her mum as well and make it clear thats its your house, not hers and she has outstayed her welcome. Mum has become WAY too comfortable.  For example, if you come home and they have their feet on the coffee table. Ask them to remove their feet.  If your housemate is not in the living room with her mum and boyfriend, change the TV to a program you want to watch and settle down on the couch asking them to move over.  If mum doesn't do the dishes, ask your housemate to clean up after her mum or comment to her mum \"looks like a lovely dinner, could you please make sure the air fryer is clean as it wasn't yesterday\"", "NTA at all. This is a totally reasonable request. Let her know that you understand that this is her first time out on her own so she isn\u2019t familiar with what\u2019s expected of a roommate. That there\u2019s an expectation of quiet enjoyment of personal space, and it is polite to ASK if you can have multiple guests over, and you would prefer she not have a guest over almost every night, or to use your things, and leaving dirty dishes in the sink is a no-no.\n\nI realize sticking up for yourself can be uncomfortable, but just be kind, like you\u2019re giving sisterly advice. It\u2019s the best you can do, then go from there. If you have to become stern, so be it. The ultimate action, of course, is finding a new roommate.", "Nta but it sounds like your roommate is just letting her mom + boyfriend take advantage of your stuff. I\u2019d be friendly but blunt- tell her you didn\u2019t sign up to live with 3 people and if they don\u2019t stop coming over one of you is going to have to move out. \n\nIn addition, I\u2019d probably start locking your items that they use (air fryer etc) in your room before leaving for work and let your roommate know exactly why- because they are YOUR items.", "You are being taken advantage of. Her mom doesnt have a tv so uses yours without consideration for you. Doesnt clean her dishes and is there every day. I doubt moms getting invited over. They probably appear to get along but your roommate goes to her room to get away from her mom when shes upset. Your roommate probably agrees with you but is too timid to stand up to her trash mom. Even if you loved having her mom over and your roommate got balls and said stop coming round so often you would get the blame, making a few assumptions here.. So might as well be the bad guy. Tell your roommate to get rid of her so you can enjoy your downtime rather than spend it cleaning up after (another assumption) a junkie or ex-junkie.", "Tell her straight that her mother\u2019s visits are becoming an issue. NTA.", "If the roommate misses her mom, tell her to visit her at HER house or move back home. Otherwise put the TV in your room and lock your room and change the wifi password", "NTA. \n\nI went through something similar and felt trapped because I didn't want to damage our friendship by setting boundaries. The boundaries being to tell me when she was having people over. My mum warned me about rooming with friends as well, as they're more likely to take advantage as your \"close\" compared to a regular one.\n\nI would come home from 12-hour night shifts, fall asleep because I was exhausted; only to wake up an hour later to most of her entire immediate family in the house (mum, dad and two brothers) with no heads up or prior warning they were coming over. She would justify it as they were dropping her/some stuff off or picking her up, but they would stay for 4+ hours talking extremely loudly and blaring our (read: my) TV. It was horrible. \n\nI would definitely talk to your friend and set hard boundaries in place, as I guarantee that resentment will build and the relationship you have with her will eventually be unsalvageable.", "No you won\u2019t be it sounds like her mom is a mooch", "NTA\n\nYou should set up a Calander and schedule what days are NO VISITOR days. You rotate weekends.. and suggest that your roommate go visit her mother if she misses her,", "This is so f-ed up. If I came home and wanted to relax in front of my tv in my living room and 2 people were there, I'd ask them to leave. I'd also tell them that they aren't allowed to make a mess. \r  \n\r  \nUnder no circumstances ask for compensation - in many places, that gives them rights.\r  \n\r  \nTell your roommate you're at the end of your rope and you need to come to an agreement about guests or not live together.

And apologize for not bringing it up sooner, because you damned well should have.\r  \n\r  \nDecide for yourself what's reasonable - what you would be comfortable with. If you're not comfortable with mom & bf twice a week, you aren't. If the roommate thinks that's too much, new roommate.\r  \n\r  \nConsider that the two of you may not be of like minds. Your roommate may not consider her mother a guest. \r  \n\r  \nIn any case - it's time to assert yourself. \r  \n\r  \nAre they bringing their own food, or are they eating yours, using your appliances and dishes, and leaving the mess for you? That's shitty behavior and your roommate shouldn't be allowing it. \r  \n\r  \nIs your roommate at least cleaning up after them? \r  \n\r  \nSorry - this just doesn't fly. Her mom and her mom's entourage do not live there and need to gtfo.\r  \n\r  \nIf you can't put your foot down, then you need to move into your own place or find a roommate who isn't going to walk all over you.\r  \n\r  \nI'm going to say NTA - but you're an AH for putting up with this.", "NTA.  You have got to have the dreaded conversation with your roommate.   \"It's fine to have your mom come over & visit, but it's like she lives here.  She's here all of the time with her bf & friends & I feel like I can't have any privacy in my own home. I live here too & I would like to come home & be able to sit in the living room & watch tv, but I can't do that bc she's always here with ppl.\"  You don't need to sugar coat it.  Be direct, but tactful.  You need to let her know exactly what the issue is so she can't make excuses.  If she can't stand up to her mom, maybe you'd be better off with a new roommate.", "She's taking advantage of your unwillingness to confront her. You need to not live with her.", "NTA. You need to remind her of this conversation and also highlight the other issues with her mom & co being in your place, using your stuff and trashing it - by not cleaning up. \nIt is possible Mom is just steamrolling her daughter, especially since you say she\u2019s not always hanging out with them but you\u2019ll still need to address it.", "Anything you can put in your room do so. Password protector things you can and don't give out the password.", "Agree with Substantial-Gap-1529. If Mom pays rent she\u2019ll end up SPENDING THE NIGHT including her boyfriend.
