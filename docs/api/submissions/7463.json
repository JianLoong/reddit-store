Over the course of the class we met 3 times a week and every week we painted or drew a new model. In the latter half of the semester my friends girlfriend came in to be a model. She of course was nude when this happened and my friend was not happy about it.\n\nHer decision to do this caused some stress in their relationship. He was mad at me also because it meant I got to see his girl naked. I old him that if I wanted an A I couldn\u2019t miss more than 3 classes and I wasn\u2019t willing to use those three classes just to avoid seeing her nude.\n\nHe was very unhappy with this and gave me a hard time about it. So after the week is up, I hand in my assignment and the professors isn\u2019t able to get me it back until before finals. So after break I come back and get my work for my portfolio.\n\nWhen I get my portraits back, I decided that they were all so good that I could put them up in my room. I choose 5 of the best and hung them up. For these particular portraits, I decided to not include the face as I wanted to give the appearance of anonymity.\n\nI hung them up and one happened to be his girlfriend. I\u2019ll be honest, im sure if I had put more than 30 seconds of thought into it, I would\u2019ve realized but I I didn\u2019t at a glance recognize her naked body as hers. I just simply did not remember what her body looked like.\n\nNext time I invite my group of friends over she come with him and they clock it. Her body is on my wall and they are not happy about it. Our other friends start teasing him a little because well now we\u2019ve all seen his gfs body.\n\nI was going to take it down but he lost his fucking shit and made a huge deal about it. Like he acted like it I was beating to her picture. We got into a huge fight. I offered to sell him the picture for $40 but he wasn\u2019t happy with that and demanded I destroy it, which obviously im not doing.\n\nWe havent spoken about it since.", "created_utc": 1673833274, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10d1jrz/aita_for_putting_up_a_painting_of_one_of_my/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You shouldn't have avoided the class for him, I agree on that. Do the project and get the grade. Buy who the fuck hangs a naked picture of their friends girlfriend up at their place. Art or not.

That was inconsiderate, even if you say it was a mistake. \n\nI would tell him that you understand why he would be upset and it was an honest mistake on your part. But also tell him if her modelling bothers him that much they\u2019d better figure it out.

Just 40? That's a weirdly specific and low price for a piece of art.\n\nHe also sucks for being such an insecure jerk that he tried to control his girlfriend and his friend- there's zero sexuality to nude modeling. As I've heard it quoted \"You're cold, naked, and trying to stay still while 30-40 strangers are glaring at the way your stomach rolls because they're fucking up the shading\"\n\n\nLastly, your friends suck for mocking them both. Absolutely gross behavior by everyone except the girlfriend.", "Yta. Your friend is an asshole too.\n\nYour friends issue is his insecurity attempting to dictate your life. Your issue was choosing his gf body to show on display knowing damn well he would have an issue about it while also embarrassing her. \n\nThe cherry on top of your asshole behavior was selling it to him just to remove it from your wall. Either you knew exactly what you were doing or your just extremely naive", "NTA. Being a nude model is usually one of the best paying campus jobs and women are better at it because they can hold still longer and are used to being ogled. \n\nAnyone who isn\u2019t paying your tuition has no input in your classes or academic output. Your friend needs to stop treating his girlfriend as property.", "YTA-  (Content Producer in here) OP missed a small detail  when it comes to ethics.  When you bring onboard a talent to perform in any shape on form, you as an artist, have the responsibility to lay out the purpose of  your vision, and ultimately make sure that you have the talent\u2019s consent. Mostly when it involves nudity and/or intimacy.  Regardless the size of the project, it\u2019s important to have said agreement written down (If you can abide to the local laws in a coercible document, all the better).\n\nThis kind of transparency, will avoid you to face big bullets down the road. It also will help you in building a great rep in your industry. \n\nBF\u2019s feels is not really your business. As far as your talent knows beforehand what are you intending to do, and you  follow your word exactly as you stated, then you are good.\n\nSounds like all this comes after lack of experience. But by doing and asking that\u2019s how you learn. And if anyone tells you that \u201cNaaah, it ain\u2019t big of a deal, just go and do it\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t trust their word.

That's 13 different models painted just body's no faces. I can see how he could get them mixed up. The girlfriend chose to be a nude model it's her that the friend needs to be mad at.

Also YTA for thinking anybody would believe you.", "Apparently I'm in the minority, but NTA.  It's her decision to model, and by agreeing to model she consented for a bunch of people she will never see again to draw or paint her naked body, and the a whole class full of people will presumably keep those renditions.  Whether or not you knew it was her when you hung up the portrait, you own the art.  Not her, definitely not her boyfriend, and not a bunch of rando friends.  consent to be a subject of a portrait can't be withdrawn long after it's done.  There's also nothing wrong with being proud of your work, and if your friends aren't mature enough to handle it, that's their problem.", "ESH, boyfriend sucks for possessiveness and expecting you to miss classes for a choice you didn\u2019t make, girlfriend and boyfriend for not respecting the others feelings or boundaries and having an actual discussion about it till they found a solution, you for putting up the pictures knowing full well there\u2019s a chance one was her and how upset your best friend was about", "My man, you did that shit on purpose and are trying to hide behind a fig leaf of art.\n\nPretty clear YTA.", "YTA i wonder if she could go to someone in the school and let them know that you dont respect their models?

Especially the part about selling it to him instead of taking it down.\n\nDo you feel like you've won some imaginary battle OP?  Because you haven't.  You've just shown people what kind of slimeball you are.", "yta\nfor hanging those drawings on the wall before your group of friends came over who you had to of known would all be seeing them and then for the fact that you tried to sell him the picture and not just give it to him or throw it away, it is one or a couple drawings of a random person who happens to be your friend\u2019s gf, weird hill to die on here and continue to flaunt in front of others.", "As a figure artist myself I have 2 questions: did the model tell you, the teacher, her bf or anyone else she was uncomfortable with you in the class? And when you saw the model was someone you knew did you ask her if it was ok if you were in the class? If someone I knew personally showed up to model I would 100% ask them how they felt. I have had personal friends model and I was excused from class despite them being ok with my attendance.  Your teacher definitely would have made a concession for you. This situation requires consent from you and the model. The bf\u2019s opinion is moot.", "NTA. She signed up to do this, her boyfriend can\u2019t handle it, that\u2019s not your fault. Is he going to go to everyone who took the class and demand they destroy their copies? Ridiculous", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA here. It\u2019s an art piece, her face isn\u2019t in it, the two of them didn\u2019t need to bring it up. They basically brought the drama on themselves. He could\u2019ve come in private and asked nicely for you to not post it up and you probably would\u2019ve replaced it.\n\nAlso he\u2019s very controlling of his girlfriends body which is a red flag when it\u2019s just art and she wanted to do it", "YTA.\n\nI took a figure drawing class in college. It's a class you take while pursuing an art degree. Figure drawing is begining art school, you have to take a LOT of other classes in fact, that cover a WIDE verity of subjects and art.\n\n**Unless your the type of artist that will eventually specialize in nude art, this class is SO NOT A BIG DEAL. It is literally to teach you the human body, proportions, etc.** It's a pre-req. And not even the funnest one. \n\nAlso, most figure drawing models are old or on the bigger side, and male. I'm guessing you didn't put a bunch of nude guys on your walls. So either your not telling the truth, or you put up just her drawing and maybe one other person. \n\nIn my time at CCS, we had mostly men, some older or obese ladies, and one young woman. This, at one of the best art schools in the US. \n\nAs an artist, if this story is true, you 100% did think about who the subjects of your drawings were.", "ESH\n\nThe thing with nude art is it's not just your property to do whatever the bleep you want with, an actual human being is in that art and what you do with that art matters.\n\nThere's likely some kind of contractual agreement made by the nude model in the first place about that as well. If there's not, there should be. What that art is going to be used for, matters to the model. It doesn't become yours to do whatever you want with and I'm tired of artists with that attitude, especially as they very frequently don't make that attitude known to the model until after the fact, so they fail to provide the model the opportunity to consent.\n\nIt doesn't even matter that it was the gf: *Any* woman posing nude and you just display the art without any knowledge or consent from the model and show it off to other people whenever you feel like, is wrong. Having *any* nudes up while you invite people over is wrong unless every single one of those models consented to having their art displayed and seen in that way.\n\nThe fact that it's the gf, just makes it worse. And the fact that she was there and making it clear it made her uncomfortable shows that it's not something she considered or consented to.\n\nThat said, the bf is a jerk for trying to make it *your* fault that his gf is modeling nude. If he has a problem he should take it up with her, not the artist. So he was an AH for the earlier part of the story.\n\nIt's possible the gf muddied the waters by not being clear about her consent, too. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt, though.\n\nUltimately it should be up to the gf what is done with the art. It's her body. Bf gets no say, and frankly you get no say either. She gets final (and only) say. I don't like how the gf's thoughts and feelings on this are largely missing from your story and barely touched on.\n\nYou need to have a talk with your teachers about the ethics of nude art and when and how to display it and show it to people.", "NTA, if he has a problem with her posing nude, he can take that up with her. \n\nFrom what your post says, I don't think he has, and instead is going after you - that's a him problem, not a you problem. \n\nYou anonymized your work, you offered to sell him the work, you've done nothing wrong here.", "NTA.    \n\n\nShe did the modeling.  This is between the two of them.  This is his insecurity and his issue.  You were going to take it down but he went ballistic instead of behaving like an adult.  At this point it's not really about the picture.  Strike that, it never really was.", "It's understandable why you'd be proud of your portfolio.\n\nAlso understandable why he'd be upset.\n\nMaybe file it away for now. At some point, that may break up or he'll otherwise forget about it.\n\nNAH", "NTA he doesn't respect or trust you or his GF. He sounds uber insecure and if you're as genuine as you sound you're not doing it out of malice. I hope the gf realizes it's not her it's him lol \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA for going to the classes and drawing the model from life, that was your assignment and you completed it. It's not your problem the model's bf flipped out at her choice (this makes your friend - or whatever he is now - an insecure, misogynistic AH to think he has some kind of veto power over her autonomy).\n\nYTA for the rest of it. I'm no art major but I used to do life drawing classes and even 20 years later I can still vaguely remember most of the models we drew. We've already established he's an AH so his overreaction is no surprise. But you really could have avoided putting her on your wall. How does SHE feel about that?", "YTA. You really weren\u2019t willing to use that as one of the 3 classes you were able to miss? Or you could have even asked your teacher beforehand if you could miss that class and make it up somehow due to being uncomfortable seeing/painting your friends girlfriend nude. I\u2019m sure they would have understood unless they\u2019re just unreasonable. \n\nThen to hang it up on your wall on have them over basically rubbing it right in his face knowing the stress it caused in their relationship and for anyone that enters your room to see? Yeah you really suck.", "[deleted]", "NTA, if the subject didn't care, and you kept it anonymous, there's nothing wrong with displaying it. BF made it a problem when no one else would've known if he hadn't said anything.", "NAH.\n\nYou know what art majors do in painting classes? They paint.\n\nYou know what they do with their paintings afterward? Anything they want.\n\nYour paintings. Your room. Your prerogative to decide which ones (if any) to hang.\n\nThat said, your friend gets to decide for himself whether or not to hate you forever.", "Im leaning NTA tbh.\n\nThis seems like a communication issue that the two of them need to work out between them.\n\nI would have said E S H if you had included faces on the portraits, but you didn't.  You're an artist.  This is art.  \n\nAnd honestly, it's nudity that was consented to, with the intention of being drawn and being taken in. \n\nIf your friend should be mad at anyone (which, by the way, he shouldn't be) it should be his gf for agreeing to model without talking to him first.", "NTA. His gf image isn\u2019t worth $40 to him? He sounds like a crap bf. Did you ask her if she possibly wanted to buy it for herself? Otherwise it can stay where it is.", "NTA.  It is your art.  Hang it where you stay.", "NTA.  You are an artist, she chose to model, you did your schoolwork, now you have a nude portrait you are proud of.  It's not a photo.  Your friend does not own his girlfriend.  He needs to wise up, he's being a baby.", "NTA. You offered to sell it to him but he refused.", "Wait, you didnt get punched in the face, especially after having the audacity trying to sell it to them after the exposure? You are hell of a lucky guy and YTA for sure.", "I wouldn't want my boyfriends friend to have a picture of my nude body at all, let alone on his wall. YTA.", "YTa because you\u2019re clearly full of shit about your intentions.", "YTA and a creep. Bro, you didn't realize it was your friend's girlfriend? Cmon now. And her being nude absolutely couldn't be the day you missed class. You just had to make that one. I'm surprised he's still friends with you cuz that's weird AF", "ESH. Your friend overreacted, but given how you knew he felt about the painting, it should\u2019ve been a pretty simple thing to recall before hanging his naked girlfriend on your wall. To have not even thought about it at all before hanging it up shows some lack of awareness.", "ESH, more on the NTA side, but he needs to take a chill pill and your last comment wasn\u2019t helpful", "I would say nobodys the asshole. I think your gender might have a big part to play if you're also a man (I didn't notice you mention this anywhere) Just give them the picture so they can do what they want with it. Honestly you probably should have gotten permission to display these pictures considering it's real peoples bodies, but if they didn't tell everyone it was her then nobody would have known. Just seems gross to display people's bodies openly without their knowledge or consent, especially if they thought they were just being nice and helping you pass your class\n\neta: if you want to display more of these types of work, maybe get online references or models who know you're going to display them openly", "NTA \n\nI genuinely don't understand why he was upset about the class.

She of course was nude when this happened and my friend was not happy about it.\n\nHer decision to do this caused some stress in their relationship. He was mad at me also because it meant I got to see his girl naked.

And if I would go to hang up my best art pieces, I would surely remember which models they came from.", ">Our other friends start teasing him a little because well now we\u2019ve all seen his gfs body.\n\nYeah, totally sounds like it's no big deal, and no mature person would have any problem with it.\n\nAnd neither you nor your friends are mature.\n\nYTA.", "He didn\u2019t even ask for her consent. Definitely the AH", "100% correct!", "Well his uncomfortableness really does nothing for me, if he was uncomfortable thats between him and his girlfriend.\n\nI was just going to class and doing my assignments. What should I have done?", "By do what I want do you mean do my work in a class", "tbh why you putting up nudes anyway", "But it\u2019s not his friend\u2019s body. It\u2019s the girlfriend\u2019s body that she chose to show to artists. For them to produce art. Of her nude body. Which she knew would happen. The insecure friend doesn\u2019t own her.", "It's a fair assumption to make that this was indeed covered by the art school as part of their process when they bring models in to pose. Therefore it's his work to do with what he pleases. NTA but the GF is for stirring this shitpot in the first place. She could have sat this one session out and it would have avoided this whole mess. I don't think the BF is necessarily a controlling dick for not wanting his mate to see his partner naked, that's a pretty normal reaction. He may not have any issue with her appearing nude to other men who he doesn't know personally.", "Why is everyone so worried about the insecure boyfriend\u2019s feelings? He doesn\u2019t own her, and she chose to model. And if the boyfriend didn\u2019t want anyone else to have the picture, he should\u2019ve bought it.", "I was honestly surprised to scroll down this far to find a NTA, because I agree. NTA. I draw a lot of nudes and sketches, of myself, random women and men I make up, off of models, whatever. I have unintentionally displayed a nude self portrait of myself from years ago (I didn't include a face) before realizing sometime later I was displaying my own body Lol. I just saw the pencil drawing and was like \"wow, I'm actually pretty proud of this older work of mine.\" If you didn't have faces in the portraits and were more focused on how the lighting was portrayed or how you captured the shadows or flow of the body, I could totally understand just looking over the model of the painting. \n\nIf they weren't there, nobody would have known the difference. and, it sounds like they announced it to the rest of their friends when they realized it? Your friend could have pulled you aside and asked that you take it down or buy it after the get-together. If anything, he probably embarrassed his girlfriend.", "Thank you! I feel like I had to scroll way too far to find anyone else who didn't just gloss over the insane boyfriend thing", "Coming from the OP that he doesn't know if the gf would be cool or not putting it up in his room......but he thinks she might. Red flags belong hanging on the OP's head.", "When I took figure drawing in college all the models were other college students and were pretty much all female.", "Ah yes, your ever so special and superior school did things a certain way, so obviously that means that every single other school does things the exact same way.\n\nMany of the stories I\u2019ve heard about nude modelling in college involve other students volunteering for it, often because they get paid.", ">It doesn't become yours to do whatever you want with \n\nActually, legally, ethically, and morally it does.  Art school models signed release forms and are aware that the student/artist owns the finished piece.  Once they agree to model and sign that release they have no say in what becomes of the finished artwork--seriously none whatsoever.  They are not forced to model; it's a choice and they are compensated.    \n\n\nThe problem here is that the boyfriend has issues with his girlfriend's choice to model and the OP intentionally hung up the picture with her to upset the boyfriend.  Maybe OP is an incel type who can't actually get a girlfriend and he's jealous of his \"friend\"?", "Yeah nah that's not how it works. It might be her body but he owns the art, that's the deal with these sorts of professional arrangements.", "Agreed. There are a lot of people taking pictures all about without considering basic foundation of art and photography: ethics. Many people say this is open to debate, when it isn\u2019t. I think this is due lack of education.", "Or even better, if he has a problem with her posing nude he can take that up with himself", "Are you really asking me why I chose to attend class instead of skipping class and dropping an entire letter grade just to make him happy?", "I'm sorry what? Haven't you ever had a class or job that you had consequences for missing too many days of? Besides the fact that the friends demands are totally controlling/possessive of his girlfriend who chose to do it, it's simply not practical to expect op to use all up his absences.", "Why would he need permission? It's his work to do with as he pleases, he can display it on a 15ft billboard at the top end of town if he so chooses. When models participate they get paid and sign to the effect that they don't lay any claim to the finished product and have been made aware of its possible future uses. It's the artist's intellectual property, the model is just the subject. Politics around bodily autonomy and consent don't come into it at all, it's a professional arrangement.\n\nIf anything it's a good argument for why the GF shouldn't have gotten involved in this scenario in the first place, she could have avoided all this awkwardness and angst by just sitting this session out in the best interests of all involved.", "I am pretty sure the models are paid. At least they are at the art school near me. The models aren't doing it \"to be nice and help people pass\". \n\nI mean I wouldn't display it. But once the girlfriend made the decision to model, she lost the rights to tell anyone what to do with the art.", "He didn't need her consent. She already did that when she signed up to be a model", "You doubt? You didn\u2019t even attempt to ask her if it was okay and if she would be uncomfortable with it?? YTA", "You weren\u2019t an AH for drawing her in class. Her boyfriend getting angry about that is 100% his problem.

You knew it would. You didn\u2019t give a shit about her either. \n\nYTA for that part.", "You need to find out if she cares. While that is your artwork it\u2019s of her body. If she\u2019s uncomfortable with it hanging up then you should take it down or even give it to her as a peace offering.", "Umm you said when you invited them over she came with her boyfriend when they clock it. Her body is on the wall and they are not happy about it. So I\u2019m guessing both weren\u2019t happy. \n\nYou\u2019re not the AH for drawing but are for hanging it up. Kinda weird to hang them up in your room.", "How are you supposed to remember the models? You would need a photo of them. Or a drawing. Or something. Not sure how you would get one of those.", "Butttt if OP truly didn't recognize the model, NTA. If the girlfriend didnt mind then no problem, boyfriend should have kept the argument between them. It's an art piece, not meant to be sexual in any way.", "Mmm.. she did consent \u2014 to model for art students, and doesn\u2019t get to control what happens to that image afterward. But I totally agree that OP is an AH and knew what he was doing.", "not hung up his naked girlfriend in your house would have been a good start", "> him **and his chick**\n\nI love it when you can tell who's the AH just by their choice of language.", "You\u2019re such an AH", "Lol that's not the issue here. You rubbed it in his face by hanging the painting. You made him uncomfortable either intentionally or negligently. Doing your coursework was fine.

You are either completely oblivious or intentionally malicious.", "No, it is the photographer\u2019s  responsibility to make sure that said agreement has been previously settled. Mostly bc by the sound of it, OP was producing it (or partially. Even so if the project end of things was appropriately cleared up, it sounds like the idea of hanging the pictures in OP\u2019s place was not discussed. Even the fact that he edited them (removing their faces) was not verbalized either (even if that was in sake of protecting the talent identity). And not only this specific model, but also the others that were hanged there. Just because OP took the pictures, it does not mean that he owns the image of the people who posed for the project. No, there is a lack of ethics in here. Like I said before, it seems that OP wasn\u2019t taught any of these.\n\nHe could have serious lawsuits and two issues if OP doesn\u2019t think through  every single detail of the photography production that he puts  together. Even  if he gets hired for a gig, it\u2019s his responsibility to make sure everything is in order. For OP\u2019s own sake. \n\nALL IN WRITTEN FORM. ALWAYS.", ">Once they agree to model and sign that release\n\nExactly. That's the consent.\n\nOP wasn't exactly very clear on when and how the gf ever provided that consent. Didn't seem to be of concern to him.\n\nIf you want to go ahead and assume that there was a release form of such kind, then sure. Whatever's on that signed release form, goes, and thus no question to AITA is even needed, the form already answers that question.\n\nWhen the form exists, that is the model's 'say.' In lack of such a form, though, the model gets the say more directly.", "Only if consent was given, typically through a signed form of some kind.\n\nOP didn't feel like details regarding the model's consent was pertinent to their post, though.\n\nI have also encountered plenty of 'photographers' and 'artists' outside of this post, outside of a school-based situation, that seem to forget about things like consent forms. Hence my general 'done with it' attitude.\n\nIf OP actually did get consent, then he's fine. Like I said in my post: each and every nude he posts, he needs the consent from that model. If he got it, then that requirement is met.\n\nThe fact that the model seemed uncomfortable with it, though, implies that even if he got that consent, he was kind of abusing it, or maybe she wasn't fully made aware of what she was consenting to, which should have been done before she gave that consent.\n\nEither way, the gf's feelings on the subject matter much, much more than the bf's feelings on the subject. That the OP was all about how the bf feels and barely mentioned how the gf feels doesn't sit right with me.", "[deleted]", "I came here to say this. He should of gave it to the girl after he got his grade.", "To be fair.  He might not be a good artist.", "I don't do portraits, but I draw and sketch.

I usually remember my mood, my thoughts about it, and the situation surrounding it. \n\n\n\nI still remember reference pictures that I used from 6+ years ago, when I was still learning shaping. \n\n\n\nThere's NO WAY I would ever forget having a friend be part of that process, especially if it was their nude.

She was not happy it was up there. OP is a creep and knows he is for this.", "They did one model a week. So it's not like there were hundreds or even dozens of models. He absolutely recognized the piece. \n\nHe already knew it would bother the guy, he had been asked to not even go to class when she was modeling.", "Thank you for quoting this. He has since changed it, but because of your comment we can all see that OP is clearly an AH.", "Can we talk about how it made the friend feel? The one actually in the drawing? I don\u2019t think it really matters if the bf was uncomfortable", "On this occasion the OP didn't manage the production at all. It was organised by the institution he's studying at so it's safe to assume they'd have all the appropriate consent and intellectual property stuff covered. And assuming everything was signed off in the correct manner then yes, he absolutely does own the images as that's what constitutes the artwork. It's his own intellectual property to do with what he chooses.", "Of course she signed a release.  Do you honestly think a major university is going to ask a woman to strip nude and be viewed by a classroom of strangers without one? This isn't a case of someone doing a friend a favor by volunteering to let him draw her nude.", ">OP didn't feel like details regarding the model's consent was pertinent to their post, though.\n\nFortunately for OP, he did this drawing as part of an elective he took. The model would have been contracted by the art school so all the legalities were definitely observed. OP did have consent to use the art he created from the model as he sees fit - he can sell it, hang it up, put it in his portfolio, etc.\n\nWhile she probably couldn't sue him for hanging up art based on her body and then inviting her friends/bf to see it, ethically he's TA. But consent wasn't the issue (not due to OP's foresight, it's just lucky the legal element was covered by the school).", "How the GF feels isn't relevant. She objectified herself by entering into the modelling arrangement, that's kinda the deal. It would have been easy for her to avoid this scenario by dipping out of the session as soon as she realised the OP was going to be party to it. That's on her so whatever feelings she may have on the outcome of this situation are well deserved.", "If i got sick, if i had an emergency, or any other valid reason that is out of my control", "OP has 3 classes a week. He can miss 3 total. I imagine that there are several weeks in a semester (16 class weeks when I was in school). So there are likely 48 classes or so total and if he used all 3 of his absences for that one week, what does he do for the rest of the semester?", "Why? All the models for this class were nude. She chose to be a nude model for an art class! The boyfriend is the one who views her as his property not to be seen by anyone. \n\nShe chose to be a nude model. She was naked for hours with people painting/drawing her. She doesn\u2019t have a problem with nudity. \n\nShould every student get rid of all their art from the class? No? That\u2019s ridiculous!? The boyfriend is insecure, but it\u2019s his issue.", "I saw OP replying to a comment that said that she didnt really care, but that would not really make sense because OP did use plural pronouns in the original post.", "To be fair I think the boyfriend is demanding a much larger say in the whole thing then he deserves. Like is nobody going to talk about how bonkers it is that he 1)got upset at his gf for modeling, (a very normal thing to do on college) and 2) asked op not to go to class for a week just to avoid seeing his gf naked?", "well then there you go.", "I think the woman in the painting absolutely matters more. OP has given little info about or, apparently, thought to her feelings. If she were proud of the painting and wanted it shown, or conversely if she did not want it shown, I would go with her feelings over the bfs for sure. That said, assuming she feels basically neutral about the whole thing, I still think hanging the painting is unnecessarily antagonistic to OPs friend.", "In that case, it would be also plausible to assume that the piece is owned by the school, not by OP. And even so, said agreement should had been shown to OP as well. If this did not happen, this ethic negligence also comes from the school\u2019s end, since the artist should had been also requested to sign it off as well.\n\nIn any case, that\u2019s up to OP to clarify. Regardless, again, there still exist a lack of ethics on checkin in before hand with the talent. It\u2019s a practice I would strongly advice to anyone. This is the image of the model at the end of the day. You can\u2019t simply go ahead and do whatever you want with it. Because these kind of issues arises afterwards. And as you move forward, it only gets worse. In this small industry everyone knows everyone. You wanna do the right thing.", "But what exactly was on the release?\n\nI could easily see one in a school system being \"for educational purposes only\" and to be destroyed once the lesson was over, or plenty of other limitations that may or may not exist on what can be done with the art afterwards and what can't be.\n\nAutomatically leaping to \"the artist can literally do anything and everything they want with it\" seems like a bold assumption to make...*especially* for an educational environment.\n\nAnd as I said in other comments, I honestly don't even care what the consent form says, I still say ignoring the model's discomfort because you have a signed piece of paper is an AH move and I'm never going to stop having that opinion.\n\nThere are plenty of other women in the world that are willing to model and not be uncomfortable about it. Getting stuck on this one and ignoring her discomfort is AH-ish. I don't care what the laws say.", ">The model would have been contracted by the art school so all the legalities were definitely observed. OP did have consent to use the art he created from the model as he sees fit - he can sell it, hang it up, put it in his portfolio, etc.\n\nI feel like this is a huge assumption to make.\n\nIt is very likely there was *a* consent form, but the exact details of what would or would not be allowed could be anything, couldn't it?\n\nIf for instance the consent was just for the purposes of learning and after review and grading, the art is expected to be destroyed, or only used for private and portfolio purposes, is not to be sold, or if it is sold the model gets a cut, etc etc. Like that consent form could have said anything.\n\nAlso, as I say in another comment, in most cases consent is both prior and ongoing, and I dislike how in this case 'ongoing' consent is not part of the picture (no pun intended). That may be legal but we don't always agree with laws 100% of the time, and this is one I think is lacking and doesn't provide enough protection for models.\n\nSo again, \"your nude art is now mine to do whatever I want with, no matter how you feel about it\" is always going to be an AH take from my pov. Only if the model truly does not care and is fine with this, in perpetuity, does it not be an AH take, in my opinion.", "How the gf feels is 100% relevant.\n\nHow she felt may have taken the form of her signing a consent form... but that form is 'how she feels' and she proved it by signing it, if that's the case.\n\nHer feelings don't just get removed from being relevant to the picture, they just take the form of that consent form, in that case. Her feelings are still there and they still matter.\n\nAnd, frankly, the \"I don't care how you feel about what I do with your nude picture\" is an AH take in my book, and always will be, consent form or not.\n\nIn most cases, consent is two-part: Prior and ongoing. I strongly dislike that 'ongoing' consent is lacking from nude modeling. I understand why that must be, but situations like this show the problems with it.\n\nThat's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "He said in the comment that he doubts she really cared and never said she didn't.

He should have asked her", "It's 100% owned by the OP as he's the artist, the school just facilitates the process. Where in the original post does it say he didn't sign anything? It's his work, he can hang it where he likes, sell it or whatever.

It may include limitations on commercial use, but is very unlikely to require that students destroy the works when they are done.\n\nBut this isn't a sub about what's legal or not. OP is an asshole for displaying the work where he knew she'd be likely to see it and it could make her uncomfortable without talking to her first.

If the bf has issues with the modeling that is between him and his gf, not OP.

Def didn't know or care whether or not the gf minds.", "Oh definitely.", "[deleted]", "And yet afterwards you HUNG her picture on YOUR wall...I'm an artist as well and you saying that you didn't realize that it was her body doesn't hold water.

Any sensible student would do everything in their power to attend all available classes to make the most of their course. Why else pay for it? The available absences were to manage unexpected situations, like a car breaking down or getting sick. OP might be TA for how he handled that picture on his wall, but taking attendance at class seriously is certainly not part of the problem."]}
