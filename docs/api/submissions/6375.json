Happy you can forgive her for what has already happened. Nothing you said indicates that she has cut off those horrible people. You could never relax in your own home because you would never know when she might bring them over.\n2. You forgive her for her bringing those people into your life; you even forgive her for joining in with their bullying to some degree. You never considered it her responsibility to protect you from the negative impact of her own personal life choices. SO WHY???? do you think it is your responsibility to protect her, that you would be an ahole for not saving her from the natural (maybe not great, but certainly not traumatizing) situation she is in and not caused by you. Why do you think you must actually put yourself at real risk to save her from her normal life?\n3. That housing shortage is true for everyone in your community looking for a place. Whoever you choose as a roommate will also be uplifted from the opportunity to rent a nice place for a nice price. You are not inflicting hurt on Jane (as she did to you); you are giving an opportunity to someone while protecting yourself from likely harm.\n4. Forgiveness is a nice thing. It's one thing to give Jane grace for being slow to see the harm she was bringing into your life. But she did more than that. She kept bringing the harm and still has not seen a problem with that. She joined in the harm. Autism is not a carte blanche to be unkind and uncaring.\n5. You don't have to explain yourself to Jane. You are not the sole decider of who will join the apartment. Just say the group decision was to go with someone else. No need to lie either. Jane was considered, but your roommates and you (will) have found someone you all agree on.

Jane can choose her friends and she keeps choosing them. You are not responsible for her and you should not sacrifice your health for her.   \n\n\nFrankly, I don't think staying friends with her is a great idea either, but that's for you to decide. While I can't claim I have super close experience with autism, I do have a friend who is autistic and while there are some things I have to take as \"that's just how \\[friend name\\] is and I need to consider he has difficulty understanding he hurt my feelings\" I wouldn't forgive him if he acted like a bully or enabled bullies. He knows better. Obviously everyone has different lives and challenges whether on the spectrum or not, and I know each case of autism is unique, but if Jane really can't understand why your former flatmates need to not even be mentioned after all your attempts to set boundaries, I don't think she is healthy for you to be around, and if she does understand but doesn't care, that's also not healthy for you to be around. Take care of yourself, OP.   \n\n\nI say this from experience: do NOT sacrifice your own health and/or happiness just because someone you know could benefit from it. There are times for sacrifice and this is not it. That said, good on you for having sympathy for her situation (but again, just because you can sympathize or empathize does not mean it is time to sacrifice) and for doing therapy.
