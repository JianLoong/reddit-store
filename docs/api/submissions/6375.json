It genuinely infuriates me when people do that because it makes us look bad.\n\nSecond, she probably isn't your friend. I've learned from experience that people like this tend to pretend to be your friend, but they will often talk badly about you behind your back.

It's completely reasonable to cut ties with someone when they do something like this, even if it is their first offense. Also I guarantee Jane living with her parents will be in no way as bad for her mental health as it would be for you if you lived together again.
