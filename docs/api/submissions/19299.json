I had enough to purchase the game however regarding I spent over \u00a330 in the last two days I didn't want to buy anything else. When I said this to them they just carried on saying it only \u00a35 and that your rich you can buy it. After that went on for a bit they went and bought the game then carried on telling me to buy it. \n\nI then decided to tell them I was saving for a new phone which was true and I didn't want to buy the game. After I told them this they decided to mute their mic on the call we were on then stopped responding to me. \n\nThe next day I decided to remove them from the meal I was planning for my birthday. So i did then they responded to me like I'm in the wrong. This is because they were looking forward to it and then they said that I ruined their plan after the exams finshed.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686237945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144c8i7/aita_for_removing_somebody_from_a_meal_after_they/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good on you for removing them now take it a step further and block their numbers lmao", "NTA They seem to try to take advantage of you by guiltrip. They aren't entitled to your money and you are the only one who can decide with whom you want to be at your party. If you thought that it was better without them, there you go. They tried to guiltrip you and didn't try to understand why you desinvite them.", "NTA. You don't owe anyone an explanation. No, I don't want to buy a game today. If they keep pressuring you it shows a lack of respect for your decision. Telling you that you can afford it? They are trying to manipulate you into doing what they want. Someone who acts this way isn't really a good friend.", "NTA: you need better friends", "NtA. They were rude to you. Seems they are using you. A free meal and game . Maybe you need new sets of friends.", "NTA. you don\u2019t owe them anything and they were trying to take advantage of you. you shouldn\u2019t have to keep people around who make you uncomfortable and try manipulate you when they don\u2019t get their way. they aren\u2019t entitled to being at your dinner, they can make their own plans if they\u2019re that bothered. also it\u2019s shocking to me that they seemed more concerned about op ruining their after exam plans instead of not being there for op\u2019s birthday. you made the right decision op, good luck with your other friends and i hope you enjoy the dinner!", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to spend time with 'friends' that make you uncomfortable.", "NTA.  They don't seem to be nice friends, so I'd say you are better off without them.", "NTA\n\nHard times go both ways, your buddy just found this out.  Want to play cute with the mic and play games acting spoiled?  OP took it quite literal and muted him but in a different way.  Good for you.", "Post makes no sense. Guessing nta.", "ESH\n\nOkay your friends were pressuring you into buying a game. They want to join the game with them which is not malicious. I'm uncertain why they muted their mic but a lack of response could mean any number of things.\n\nYou then decided to uninvite them. I'm sorry I just don't understand the logic here. It doesnt seem like they were an AH to you maybe a tad rude but your response is out of proportion.", "[deleted]", "ESH. They were wrong to continue to badger you after you said you didn't want to, but basically disinviting someone from an event without even telling them or attempting to have a conversation about it is also wrong.", "ESH. They shouldn't continue nagging you after you gave a clear \"no,\" and it's AH-level petty to uninvite them to a dinner over it. That's how you lose a friend: a minor disagreement leads to less time together and a lost companion. Be the one who's big enough to get over it and enjoy dinner.", "ESH\n\nI get being annoyed by people pestering you, but this was a petty thing to do to your friends. They were just giving you a hard time. Friends do that. No need to get butthurt about it.", "this! they only seemed mad that it ruined their post-exam plans which makes me think they only care about the meal being covered and not about how their actions hurt op.", "I suspect that this is the singular form of \"they,\" so only one friend has been removed. Other nouns in the narrative are singular and there's one \"he\" in there.", "OP friends hung up on them just because OP decided to buy a phone instead of a game! :\n\n''I then decided to tell them I was saving for a new phone which was true and I didn't want to buy the game. After I told them this they decided to mute their mic on the call we were on then stopped responding to me.''.\n\n I'd say that OP's friends uninvited themselves at that moment.", "you know what\u2019s an easy way to get uninvited from an event? badgering your friend about their spending and getting mad when they don\u2019t buy something you want bc \u201cthey can afford it\u201d. not to mention ignoring them and only getting mad bc it ruined their after exam plans. the friend clearly doesn\u2019t care about op and op isn\u2019t ta for not wanting them at their dinner.", "I doubt a one sided conversation would have accomplished much", "Nice use of the verb badger.", "It's not petty to uninvite someone who is disrespectful to you.", "OP's friends asked them to buy the game since they are \"rich\" and can \"afford it\". When OP tells their friend that they are saving for a phone they proceed to but the game and ignore OP throughout the call. So OP's friends were forcing them to buy the game, and when they failed, they neglected OP. How is this not petty?", "Grade A recap. I didn't get it all the first time. /s\n\nFirst off, this whole post is hearsay. I wouldn't say they were forcing him to buy the game, nor would I say that they neglected the OP. Ignored? Maybe. But neglected? Come on.\u00a0\n\nI also didn't say that what they did wasn't petty. I only mentioned that the OP was being petty. Hence the ESH.", "how was op being petty? it\u2019s not petty to not want someone at your dinner who makes you uncomfortable and doesn\u2019t respect your wishes. also they clearly don\u2019t care about op and are more mad about missing a meal and possibly the game.", "OP was being petty in response, while what OP's friend did was uncalled for.", "If you can't see how this is petty, then me explaining it to you won't change anything.", "I'm glad we came to the same conclusion. I don't see how what you're saying is any different from what I'm saying.", "i just want to understand better, what do you see that indicates op is petty? because from what i see, op isn\u2019t petty for dropping a friend that treats them poorly, that\u2019s pretty reasonable imo. also there\u2019s a difference between giving your friends a \u201chard time\u201d and blatantly disrespecting their wishes.", "To preface\u2014 and this could just be a difference in generations\u2014my friends and I give each other a hard time pretty regularly, but it's in jest. No lines are ever really crossed.\n\nTo me, insisting someone buy a video game for $5 \"because they're rich\" is just giving someone a hard time. They're not \"forcing\" the OP to buy the game. Then, when they bought the game and OP didn't, they went silent. Maybe because they were all playing together without OP, or maybe because they wanted to be petty. We don't know. From my experience with my friends, this is just how playing games works. We've gone hours in a party without saying anything if we're playing different games. We just like to hang out at parties together.\n\nOn how the OP was being petty. OP removed them from their birthday party as a direct result of them muting their mics the day prior. They made something small into something much larger. This is how you lose friends. By making mountains out of molehills. \n\nGranted my justification comes from anecdotal evidence, but this is also Reddit and not a courtroom lol.", "i guess that\u2019s where we disagree, i think them not accepting op\u2019s answers to the point they had to start giving other reasons as to why they didn\u2019t want to buy the game. \n\ni also think them pushing and saying they can afford it is crossing boundaries, they don\u2019t know everything about op\u2019s finances and op\u2019s answer of no should\u2019ve been enough. and then muting on the call and ignoring them shows immaturity and lack of respect for op\u2019s decisions which is why i don\u2019t think op was being petty.\n\nit feels fair to me that op wouldn\u2019t want a friend at her dinner who can\u2019t respect their choices and proceeds to ignore them for seemingly no reason. it seems to me that this was a final straw for op and even if it seems petty, the actions of op\u2019s friend were unkind and not of a real friend. it\u2019s fair that op doesn\u2019t want that person at their dinner and i think it\u2019s safe to assume the friendship may be over.", "Understandable, and we can agree to disagree. In the end, we are just speculating about what happened in someone else's life over the internet. \n\nHave a good one, bud."]}
