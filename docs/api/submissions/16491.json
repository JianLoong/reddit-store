So for context we have a roommate who's been with us for I believe at 6 months. Well I've been able to keep laundry detergent for longer than a month between me (26), my boyfriend (28) and my kids (6) clothes.\nAnyways our roommate (24f) has been washing her clothes at least 3 times a week so our laundry detergent is gone within a month. Thing is I've asked her to get more when she uses it all but she always has some kind of excuse for not getting it. Same with any other necessities like toilet paper, hand soap, and soap for the dishwasher or to wash dishes with at all.\nSo I ordered more laundry detergent and hid it in our gaming room under my desk.\nAm I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "No. You're not the asshole.  \n\nThe roommate is exhibiting a clear freeloader pattern.  If she's gone six months without buying laundry detergent, dishwashing soap or toilet paper she'll probably never buy her own stuff as long as she can use yours.   \n\nYou've asked her to buy some to cover her use and she's so far refused.  While hiding your stuff works, having to bring a roll of toilet paper with you to the bathroom every time you go will get old quick. Same with soap, etc.  Also, if you don't hide the stuff in your bedroom (and even if you do) she may just find it and use it anyway and pretend nothing is weird. My suggestion is that if it's financially doable, you kick her out and look for a new roommate who will help out with supplies.", "NTA - either she can pay more per month to cover all the necessities y\u2019all share or she can start pulling her weight.", "Nope, NTA. Everyone should contribute and you have tried to communicate that to her.", "op=NTA\n\nBut I wouldn't be Keeping this roommate.  I'm not much on theft and at this point(since she refuses to buy more but keeps using Detergent) it is stealing.  Among other essentials(TP, soap etc).  \n\nHow does she do on food?", "What about a trade off of communal things? Like you buy the detergent and she buys the toilet paper.", "It's my boyfriend's house. He bought it off his parents so she's technically the who would have to move", "I guess I could've worded that better \ud83d\ude02", "She works in a restaurant and apparently only has two uniforms for it", "I worked a job where I had 3 chef's coats--So I get the twice a week washing(or 3 in her case, I guess) but you pay for your own darn laundry supplies--she annoys me just reading about her.", "The only reason we agreed was because of how her parents were treating her for being MTF.", "I'm pretty much the only one who buys food because I use the child support for it. So every two weeks me and my boyfriend will go food shopping. I pay most of it with the child support and the rest with my own money. The only reason I don't mind that my boyfriend doesn't buy the food is because he's already paying the mortgage and most of the bills. He does make her pay rent as well.", "oh even better if you can afford to not have the extra money maybe no more roommates but definitely don't feel bad not renewing her lease or whatever you need to do to get someone who steals out. Congrats on the house though!", "That does make a difference but she should still be contributing.  She's 24. I had assumed she was paying rent at least. \n\nIf she's paying rent, maybe tell her costs are going up and you're going to have to tack on an extra $10 or $20 a month. Use that to cover her lack of contributing supplies.    \n\nIf she has a job or money to support herself, she's not paying rent and she's still not contributing then you're for sure not the asshole. In that case tell her that she has to at least contribute something to the household expenses.  Then if she still refuses, you'll have to consider how far your charity extends. \n\nIf she's not paying rent, is in a mentally bad place and you've taken her in to help her out because she has no resources or other place to go, then you have to consider the possibility you've just gained another child.  She is 24 and if she's not getting better and putting in the work to be independent she's basically another kid, but one who may never quite grow up and out of it.  Sometimes people are in the situation they're in because they're incapable or refuse to push themselves to get their shit together. Again, NTA, but you have to decide what the limits of your charity will be.\n\nOnce you decide, you need to communicate that to her with care and compassion.  If you refuse to do that, then yes, you may be the asshole.", "If she\u2019s otherwise OK, you also could increase her rent to account for those extra expenses (including all the water that uses!).", "Great post! I would slightly counter that we only hear one side. But, this is all still very true!\n\nI had a roommate that once admonished me for breaking a $5 plate that I wouldn't pay for and leaving a plate covered in crumbs on the counter.\n\nThe crumb plate sat for 15 minutes while I took a work call outside and was then addressed by me. The roommate also put tin foil in a $1,200 microwave and fried it. So my $5 oops was applied to that owed cost imo. (Never was reimbursed for that) The other side sometimes offers more context. \n\nRegardless, if consensus cannot be reached, time to move on.", "Yes my boyfriend makes her pay rent. She has a job at a restaurant and says she's been trying to find a new one.\nI'm not sure about how she is mentally because it's something she doesn't like to talk about. I do know she goes to a therapist (I also know that that doesn't always help).\nI know I should say something it's just I'm super empathetic and it's hard for me. Yes I know not the best excuse. I have talked to her about the toilet paper so she did buy that last week I think it was.", "NTA", "NTA", "Just evict her.  Why do you put up with someone like this?", "I worked in Food once and I get this, stuff gets oily and dirty really quickly. My work only gave us two sets of uniforms because they were cheap. But you're still NTA in any way, I hide stuff in my room sometimes I don't want anyone to have. It's your stuff, you can do whatever you want with it.", "\u201cHey, we enjoy having you as a roommate but between the additional laundry and household goods, we\u2019ve need to increase the rent to cover these costs.\u201d\n\nAnd then tally the additional materials she uses, as well as extra utilities for water + electricity (because no one anticipates a roommate washing their clothes 3x\u2019s a week? Like, that is a lot).  Suggest that she buy additional uniforms as well - because while her work might only supply her with two, I don\u2019t know of a single place that doesn\u2019t allow you to purchase additional uniforms if need be.", "She's eating food you provide with your child support? I can't be okay with this, sorry. NTA.", "She rarely eats at home honestly. She always goes and spends her money on fast food \ud83d\ude44 \nEdit: spelled it's instead of eats", "Okay. I mean that's is less upsetting but if she can do that she needs to stop using all your disposable goods.", "NTA. Sometimes you have to force someone's hand. I did something similar in college when sharing a bathroom with 3 roommates, but with toilet paper. I bought some for myself that I kept in my bedroom and literally brought a roll in with me when I used the bathroom. It worked pretty quickly lol. \n\nAlso if I were doing that much laundry (or using any resource clearly more than the other housemates) I'd get my own supply for myself and use that, it's much simpler. Your roomie is just inconsiderate.", "NTA. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to keep those kind of items hidden but the fact she hasn\u2019t bought them at all, is enough to keep them ALL hidden. Don\u2019t stop at the laundry detergent, put away all of the items that hasn\u2019t contributed to at all. Especially if she\u2019s using them.", "NTA. She can buy her own laundrey detergent.", "NTA. I also live with a roommate, also with my husband. When I was pregnant, around 2 trimester I told my roommate/bff that I would be buying specific laundry detergent like the free and clear ones, the reason is I'm about to have a baby and also she uses more detergent than usual which is fine I do the same but idk how much she uses each load. We were very specific with our detergent before because we also have to like the smell of the detergent. Plus her brother is also going to live with us to save money to go on our separate ways. \n\nHaving our own detergent was one of the best thing I did, plus the food. I didn't have to buy any detergent for 4 months, given that I also use a different one for dark colors. And they buy every month and a half. For some reason the brother does laundry on a Saturday, all day. The sister does the laundry on a Sunday, all day. Lol", "NTA", "Nta, does her rent cover necessities? She should either be buying her own or if she refuses, include it in her rent. Her entitlement is ridiculous"]}
