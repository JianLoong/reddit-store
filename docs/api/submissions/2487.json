There's a group of about 12 of us.\n\nWe're all early 30s so I understand that it was immature of us to even play truth or dare but at the end of a drunken night last wknd somebody jokingly suggested playing and we did.\n\nBackstory, one of the women in the group (S) has a crush on me for years. S is cute but not a great match personality wise. We had a conversation a while back and I told her I'm not interested but she is still flirting with me almost constantly.\n\nMy best friend (M) has been dating his girlfriend (B) for about 6 months. They're perfect for eachother, I seriously am so happy he found her, they're really perfect matches, I've never seen my friend so happy. It's soon but I'd be shocked if she isn't \"the one\". Relevant to the story, B is absolutely stunningly gorgeous, but truly in a \"does she even know how gorgeous she is?\" way. She doesn't wear make-up and her hair is always messy or thrown up in a bun, so it's not like she's trying to get attention (very much not her personality), but she turns heads everywhere she goes. I don't fixate on this but it's not something that people don't notice, so of course when we met I noticed it. Until this point I've never commented on it and I've enjoyed getting to know her as a person and I cannot stress enough how happy it makes me to see how good she is to M and how happy they are together. \n\nS doesn't like B. We've sensed it from the start, nobody else really knows why. The rest of the group has welcomed B with open arms but S has always been strangely cold and standoff-ish with her. B handles it gracefully.\n\nTruth or dare: S asked me who I thought was the most attractive person in the room and I said \"everybody here knows B is absolutely gorgeous\". I was a little too drunk and I know now that S wanted me to say her. In retrospect I should have said M and made a joke about us being soulmates (which is a running joke about our friendship), but I didn't, so.\n\nS stalked out of the room and yesterday she sent me a long text about how she can no longer be in the same room as me and that we'll have to work out which events each of us are going to go to going forward. She said I embarrassed her in front of everybody and that it was shady of me to \"hit on\" B in front of her boyfriend. Called me a bunch of nasty names and Saif \"everybody agrees with\" her, even though the three or four I've asked said they didn't see an issue with it. They are however upset that I've blown up the friend group right before holiday events. I called M to make sure we were good, he said it was just a game no hard feelings. I don't know how to respond to S because I do feel really bad but I don't know if I was wrong.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTl;dr: Played a childish game of truth or dare with friends. Female friend asked who I thought was the most attractive person in the room and I said my best friend's girlfriend.
