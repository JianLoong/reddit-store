The last year or so when visiting, me and my gf have been talking about moving back there, as while it is not as good for our careers it its much better quality of life.\n\nLast month we're back for a family thing and start looking for houses. One in particular near my folks house stood out and we were very excited about it. There are not a lot of houses of that standard available in that village. On the last night of our stay we had a big family dinner and talked about it and how nice it was.\n\nIt's worth saying that we don't have jobs there yet but after we flew back out, we were talking to the estate agent about doing a long takeover for that reason. And that fit the owners well. But there were still a few things for us to iron out when moving countries before we could make an offer.\n\nThat's when I hear that my sisters bf who lives a bit away from my family (they all live in that village) went to look at it too. I'm a bit annoyed because he only planed a viewing after hearing how nice we thought it was. So I call up my dad and asks what is going on. I know that while my sister could never afford it, my parents bought the house she is currently living in and might be able to, and my sisters BF does well but also has wealthy parents. So I ask my dad directly if they were going to move their investment into this house for my sister, and they say no, never. I also make it clear that I am working on making an offer and would not be happy if my sister and her bf makes one.\n\n2 days later while I've been talking to banks etc, I get at text from my mum saying she's sorry to tell me but my sisters BF have made an offer. I text back that I am disappointed, but I hold back because I don't really want to involve them as it's between me+gf and my sister+bf. \n\nPisses me off though has now I either have to let it go or enter a bidding war \u2026 which is ridicules, so I end up dropping it.\n\nTwo days later my 2nd sister texts me and and says she is sorry as well, and to her I don't hold back  I say between me and hear how angry I am that my 1st sisters BF who knew I was actively working on purchasing it and just swooped in and did that. I know that I have some hurdles to jump and that I can't prevent him from offering, but the fact that he knew the situation and hurried to get a bid in without even calling me and asking me or letting me know is just pretty bad form.\n\nMy 1st sister then text me to say \"oh we didn't know you were really interested\".. I haven't replied yet.\n\nTo top it off... Today my dad calls me and says \"Oh we didn't think the house is that great actually... and by the way, we bought part the house with your sisters BF so that, your sister can be on the deed.\"\n\nI explode on the phone. Saying I think my sis's BF is a douche for swooping in and not letting me know, and that they suck for buying in as well after saying they wouldn't. After much debate I hang up.

I would be hurt if it was family that bought a house I was interested in. That's the emotional part of me. Realistically, there is no guarantee you would have gotten this home. You weren't ready to make an offer. Had no financing secured. No jobs in this area. How long would all of this take? You could have presented an offer contingent on financing, before BF swooped in.

Don't move back there. Your parents and your whole family don't consider you as much as you think about them.

Your parents have clearly chosen their favorite.", "What I am about to say may not be some thing you dont want to hear but...\n\nNTA by the way\n\n1. Your family just showed that you should not trust them\n2. Your family has indirectly told you that they do not want you back in your home country\n3. I think you just found out who the favored child between you and your sister. I say this because after reading your post and comments, your parents could have helped you pay part of the house payment to make things easier for you, since they did it for your sister, why couldnt they do the same for you to make things easier if you already made your plans on the house extremely obvious.\n\nMy petty ass suggest that you do not tell them when you are going back to visit/vacation and just post on social media that your back home enjoying the sights and then fly back without seeing them", "NTA\n\nTo be honest I wonder if your parents want your sister closer and they all had discussions about your sister and her bf moving in? Thats why no one was honest with you. Even if they thought you wouldn't be able to make an offer...they would have been open and honest with their involvement prior to taking action.\n\nIf you like it put your offer in, even if its a bidding war. Everyone expects you to rollover and let them have it. Then your sister will know you really want it...and see what she does. Backoff or digs her heals in.\n\nAnd I don't understand why your parents helped your sister and not you. Thats confusing.", "NTA but on the upside, now you can look at houses in a much bigger range..

Also moving back there will 100% be the single biggest regret you'll ever have.", "NTA. Damn, that's fcked up on so many levels. Hell, just look at this situation as a blessing in disguise. They just showed you and your gf where you stand within the family before you wasted more time and resources on finding a home local to them. \n\nPersonally, that level of disrespect would be enough to erase whatever delusions I had for \"better quality of life\" with them and have me reconsider even moving at all. I'd never be able to look them in the eye the same way again, sheesh. \n\nYou two should just no contact those liars for now (forever sounds better if I'm being really honest). If you move near them or speak to them again, fully expect that everyone will resweep it under the rug like no big deal when it really is and they're gonna make you two the bad guys for still being upset.\n\nSorry you two went through this, good luck and choose wisely.", "NTA.  You are fully entitled to be thoroughly angry with the lot of them.  Personally I\u2019d now go no contact with the lot of them.
