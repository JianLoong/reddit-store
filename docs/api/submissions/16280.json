Molly and I have been friends for about four years now so as I feel bad for the situation I agreed with her to help her out. I told her she could count on my as her child's dad, that means I can take her to appointments, buy stuff from her, helping her around her apartment and whatever else she needs since I guess that she will need a lot of help now. I know that my older sister had a hard time when she had my nephew and she had my BIL around so I'm guessing it will be much nore harder to do everything alone. \n\nMy girlfriend \"ash\" (f23) is not happy with my agreement with Molly. She's basically jealous because I help molly out. For example the other day she got angry because I went to a doctor's appointment with her (I don't go in, I wait outside). Sometimes I also buy snacks and stuff that I know she likes or medicine if she needs it. \n\nMy girlfriend thinks that I'm overstepping and that I shouldn't get myself into this or people will think it's my baby. I told her that's a dumb reason to not help a friend. She also thinks I'm spending too much time with Molly now which is not ok because I always spend time with her, I don't think I'm spending more time with her now than I did before. \n\nMolly and I were talking and she said it'll be nice if I'm with her in the delivery room since I have been a lot of support for her and she'll need support while giving birth too, I told her I'd love to support her as best as I can and if she wants that then I can do it. Later me and Ash were talking and I told her this. We had an argument and she tried to get me to tell molly that I won't be helping her anymore or that I'll be helping her just a little bit during emergencies. I told her I won't do that, I already compromised to helped her and her baby once it's born, I won't take back my word now. She got upset and left, now she's not wanting to talk to me. Am I the asshole for trying to help?", "created_utc": 1683113710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136hyba/aita_for_helping_my_friend_while_shes_pregnant/", "score": 236, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seriously OP. There must be other people that can be in the delivery room with her. I get you want to help, and helping a little is fine, but you\u2019ve literally taken over as the dad. That\u2019s really hurtful and Molly sounds as if she\u2019s loving this. It\u2019ll come between you and Ash.\n\nEdit to add YTA", "Info: How long have you been together with Ash? \n\nIt probably seems to her that you now have two girlfriends, since you're doing everything that a father of a child would be expected to do. So you have a family and a girlfriend. You really don't get why she's upset?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. As much as I hate to say it, you just became a baby daddy. Your girl had every right to be jealous/upset in this situation. \n\nI'm curious, would you afford your gf the same sort of care/help/adoration?", "YTA you aren\u2019t \u201chelping\u201d your friend, you committed to being her baby\u2019s father. Of course people are going to think her baby is yours! You\u2019re basically acting like her partner. You chose her over your girlfriend so don\u2019t be surprised when your girlfriend sees no reason to stay.", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you say, \u201cwe\u2019ll help out\u201d? You\u2019re not the father, so it makes sense your girlfriend is a little annoyed. She\u2019s also realizing this is just going to get worse once the baby is born.", "YTA\n\nI was prepared to be on your side due to the title of this post but signing up to be this kid's dad is too much to ask if you genuinely want to continue your relationship with your gf. I'm guessing that at some point your gf will have your kids and she will (reasonably) expect you to make your own children a priority over your friend's kids.", "YTA and what you're doing is plain weird\n\nAlso have you considered that \"being a dad\" is not something casual and that it's a lifetime commitment? Think about it carefully, there's no going back once the child gets attached to you (unless you're a monster that likes hurting kid's feelings)", "YTA. This is plain weird. Your gf has every right to be pissed.", "YTA, you sound as if you want to be acting the dad with Molly than wanting to spend time with your gf. Noone can fault her for wanting her bf to behave differently as you seems to be in too deep. Where does it stop for you? With all the attachment you are showing, Molly would want you around until the child grows up and it could go on for years. Why should your gf live through this where shes a second or third priority at 23 when she can find someone who treats her the way she expects at her age. All the best to her.", "Did you agree to be a childs Dad without asking your girlfriend? Gee I wonder why shes annoyed. YTA. That level of commitment to another human will affect your relationship.\n\nI'd be ok with you being very supportive and spending lots of time with your friend but that crosses a line.", "There's a difference between helping someone when possible and volunteering to be a child's father which is a huge and long term responsibility. It doesn't seem possible someone thinks becoming a father to a child is the same as just helping someone. YTA for assuming your girlfriend is jealous you've volunteered to be a parent. If that's what you want, it's fine to expect the relationship to end.", "YTA. \nYou are prioritizing your friend's life to your girlfriend. \nNow you spend a lot of time babysitting her, what when her son will born? Will you act like his/her dad? There is no reason for you to act like that, you can help sure but you can't act like her partner. So yes, YTA ,also for saying that you gf is jelous even tho she is 100% in the right to be.", "There\u2019s being a friend and there\u2019s overstepping. You\u2019ve jumped into over stepping and I don\u2019t blame your girlfriend for being angry. How would you feel if your girlfriend was pregnant and she told some dude they were welcome in the delivery room? (It\u2019s the same principle) \n\nI think you can safely say bye to your girlfriend\n\nYeah YTA, are u gonna offer to be on the birth certificate as well?", "YTA. You seem to be more than just helping. While it is a good thing to be there for friends in time of need. You are emotionally invested, way too invested.\nYour gf is right. You are overstepping. It seems that her pregnancy is just the beginning.  What would you do when ilthe baby is here ?\n\nWhat would you do when your friend will be in a serious relationship or married, and her SO will act as a legitimate father figure.\n\n I bet that OP will post here something like : stepfather of baby that I helped raise is way too involved with them.", "YTA. Helping out a single mother friend looks like: \n- offering to babysit\n- offering to do store runs\n- sending over the occasional meal \n- throwing a baby shower\n- at a push, offering to go over and help out with feed/overnights WITH your girlfriend (if she is comfortable with it) on a rare occasion. \n\nHelping out a friend does not look like making a unilateral decision in your relationship where you agree to father someone else's child and go be a birth partner without discussing it with your partner first. \n\nYou want to father your friend's kid? Go be in a relationship with Molly since its what you both clearly want and let your girlfriend be free to find someone who will love and prioritise her.", "YTA. It sounds like you\u2019re having an emotional affair and neglecting your girlfriends boundaries and feelings.", "YTA.\n\nLook, it's not a horrible thing for you to do - but it's also not correct. The 'I'll act as your child's Dad' is not right. You are in a committed relationship and essentially saying you're going to father a child whilst in said relationship.\n\nIf you're gonna play house with another woman - have the decency to end your current relationship and fully commit to this new family you've just committed yourself to.", "YTA. \n\nBeing a part of the village to help raise a child is a wonderful thing, but that isn't what you're doing here. You have said, verbatim in your post, that you are stepping up as this child's father and that goes beyond being a part of the village supporting mom and child; you are actively becoming a part of the nuclear family. \n\nI completely understand where Ash is coming from and I think if you're really honest with yourself, you've likely pushed Ash to the side in favour of Molly. She is understandably hurt and needs you to draw some clearer boundaries.", "YTA\n\n\"Molly and I were talking and she said it'll be nice if I'm with her in the delivery room since I have been a lot of support for her and she'll need support while giving birth too, I told her I'd love to support her as best as I can and if she wants that then I can do it. \"\n\nYou might think you are being friendly, but from an outside perspective, this very much reads as Molly seeking you out as a parent for her child, and also asking you to come to literially EVERYTHING concerning the baby is driving away your girlfriend, though I think that ship sailed a while ago when you did not take her concerns aboard and instead \"were there for your friend\"\n\nIt is one thing to drivee your friend to her appointments, it is very different to agree and even be asked to be in the delivery room, which is a place some women would not even allow their MILs inside of, much less their male friend.", "YTA and you\u2019ll probably be single soon so you can really throw yourself into being the baby\u2019s father, love that for you.", "YTA - you've way overstepped the friend boundary and you even said you'll be the babies father? So you're basically in 2 relationships just without the physical stuff?\n\nIf you helped out a little (gave the odd lift, bought birthday presents etc) then it wouldn't be so bad.", "You told your friend she could count on you as being the child\u2019s father and all of that stuff\u2026and you don\u2019t understand why your actual gf is jealous or thinks you overcommitted? Seriously?", "YTA, you have stepped way over friend level. Their is being nice and helpful then there is this.", "YTA.  That is a lot of commitment to just a friend, I don't blame your girlfriend for being upset, it is only a matter of time before she is gone.\n\nYour friend is taking advantage of you because she knows that level of commitment will interfere with whatever relationship you are in.   Baby daddy dipped so she knows she is over a barrel unless someone steps in, and that is you.  I promise you, if baby daddy shows back up and acts right, you would be replaced before you even knew what happened.  If not, you will be babysitting her kid while she looks for a suitable replacement.", "YTA.  You basically decided to become a father without even discussing it with your girlfriend. This has implications for your relationship with Ash that you are refusing to acknowledge because it\u2019s inconvenient to you.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re going to go all-in on being this baby\u2019s dad, you better be prepared for a lifelong commitment to that child.  Letting Molly\u2019s child develop an attachment to you as a father figure and then deciding to peace out after a few years when you meet someone you want to have a \u201creal\u201d family with would be cruel.", "YTA 100%, just break up with your girlfriend already if you are going to be like this. You seem you want to be in a relationship with this Molly but your brain hasn't caught up yet. \nWhat you are doing to your gf is actually extremely hurtful. You either take it down. like waaaaaaaay down with this Molly, or you break up with your gf and save her from being hurt by you, and your stupid actions. Going into the delivery room with her ? What the hell are you thinking! That is way to much\n\nYou ignore every concern she has and only care about what Molly feels or goes through. You can't even be bothered to understand what your girlfriend feels. That says enough", "YTA. Wow", "YTA for not discussing this with your partner.\n\nOffering to become a  'dad' or 'uncle' to someone else's baby is a big commitment. It involves your time, effort, money, emotions, that you would otherwise have spent on your partner. Also if you live together then it effects her too because she will essentially be like a step mother or aunt. \n\nPlus it looks like you are romantically interested in your friend. Whether you deny this is irrelevant, your choices and actions show you'd rather act like a partner to your friend rather than your actual girlfriend.\n\nYou are in a relationship so this isn't your decision alone. It needs to be discussed and agreed on. Or you can break-up.", "How long have you been in love with Molly? YTA", "A large part of being friends with someone is establishing healthy boundaries.\n\nIt is commendable that you are eager to help a friend in need. But, in the delivery room? Aren\u2019t you going too far? Doesn\u2019t she have family, siblings, someone who could be there for her in the long run?", "Yta. There\u2019s helping and then there\u2019s overstepping a boundary. \n\u201cI told her you can count on me as her child\u2019s dad\u201d.     But you\u2019re not and your have a gf. Your gf is in her right to be suspicious because now Molly wants you in the delivery room? \nAre you naive or just clueless? Maybe you\u2019re trying to be a good friend and a nice guy but it seems here like Molly knows what she\u2019s doing.", "This one's tricky, I think you're being a nice guy but it sounds like you really want to be with this pregnant girl and not your current gf. You're basically her boyfriend except you're not having sex with her. I really can't decide where the judgement goes on this but I think your gf is right to a degree. YTA for the emotional adultery I think.", "You need to let Ashley go and be with Molly. It's clear she sees you as more than a friend--she plans on you being her baby's dad. If this isn't what you want (though by all indications it is), back off and let her begin to figure things out for herself.", "YTA. Ash must really love you to be putting up with you playing dad with another woman.", "Wow dude \ud83d\ude33 how can you be this dense. Of course YTA!! And the worst boyfriend too. \nYou basically started a relationship with Molly and if she had any respect for your girlfriend she wouldn\u2019t let you or even ask of you to do all that you guys are doing. And If you are doing all this because you have feelings for Molly then you need to quit stringing along your girlfriend. She has every right to be mad and jealous you complete moron!!", "YTA\n\nLook, it's not like anything you've done is straight up wrong, but it's... troubling. It shows a lack of concern for your partner's feelings, and a willingness to step into an intimate space with someone else, whether that's sexual or otherwise. \n\nIf you were single, it'd be creepy. You're in a relationship, and it's careless. \n\nYour partner isn't jealous, they're insecure. Show care and affirmation, I think your heart is mostly in the right place", "NTA.   \nBut clueless. Completely idiotic level clueless here.   \nSee \u2026 Molly is suddenly alone in the world, pregnant, and needing help. That\u2019s \u2026 understandable. Along comes Knight in Shining Armour Full\\_Move to help on every front.   \n\n\nNO WOMAN wants a male \u2018mate\u2019 friend/bro/dude/guy in the delivery room when she\u2019s pushing a watermelon out a lemon sized hole.   \n\n\nSo\u2026 Molly is (either via the psychological term \u2019transference\u2019 or maybe more intentionally\u2026) latching onto you as a good bet going forward.   \n\n\nThat\u2019s how this reads. It really does. You\u2019ve even offered be a defacto dad to the kid\u2026 that\u2019s a lifetime commitment!   \n\n\nSo your girlfriend is reading this situation and thinking \u201cOh crap, my boyfriend is getting sucked into the vortex/completely naive and this is going to get bad/falling for her/has no idea what he\u2019s getting into/doesn\u2019t know how to set boundaries with her\u2026.\u201d And asking you to set \u2026 boundaries.

No. You are being unfair to Molly if you make promises you won\u2019t keep.

By all means be there for the kid but cop onto yourself when it comes to the child's mother, she is not your responsibility and it sounds like she is milking it to get you to be her sugar daddy!

I mean, you do you, but you've made a huge commitment and you have to accept the reality that this is a huge dealbreaker for most people.", "You are a dingus. You have no clue what you're doing or saying. You've crossed a lot of boundaries and put yourself in an idiotic position. You can be there for your friend but you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT call yourself the dad. Your gf probably isn't going to be your gf much longer. YTA.", "YTA. You literally told your friend you'll be the dad of her child.

Have some common sense dude\u2026", "YTA - So..... are you in love with Molly? \n\nSo you are not an ah for offering to help your friend however when I read you had a gf I was surprised and that is when you became an ah. What you are doing is very sweet and kind but you are in love with Molly. Why do I think this, because even husbands and fathers to be aren't doing the things you are doing. No wonder your gf is upset. You are made yourself a 'parent' to someone else's baby and it sounds very much like you have a relationship on the side. Your gf should be jealous tbh and has every right to be upset.", "YTA / sounds like you are in love with molly", "No, not for trying to help.\n\nYTA, a bit, for how you're treating Ash.", "Help your friend by building  a support system for her. Forcing family interaction. Maybe look for this guy . Keep tabs on him. So when she needs to go to court, you know where he is. Getting her connected to services going forward.

It\u2019d be one thing if you had taken this commitment prior to the relationship with your girlfriend but you unilaterally made this decision without a thought of her. You\u2019ve tied yourself to Molly and her kid for life and I don\u2019t blame your girlfriend if she decides to walk away. You have no consideration for her in this whole life changing situation you\u2019ve inserted yourself into.", "YTA. If you\u2019re in a serious relationship, a commitment this big needs to be agreed on together.", "YTA... tbh I dont think the core issue is about Molly or a potential relationship with her but its about the baby.... agreeing to step in as the childs \"dad\" - even \"like an uncle\" as you described in a  comment - is a major life decision you've just taken without consulting her at all. You say yourself that you've always spent time with Molly, so you must see that this is different. You're not hanging out with her as a mate, you're stepping into a partnership with her. \n\nI also think you've made a big commitment to Molly without really thinking it through, given that you dont seem to grasp the weight of your offer, and seem surprised that it affected your long term partner at all.", "You definitely have a \"white knight\" complex and I think that it's all you see. I'm not sure I agree with everyone that you're in love with Molly....but this definitely isn't the relationship Ash signed up for. \n\n\nBut it sounds like you just want to feel special and like a savior.

You're obviously doing a wonderful thing helping, but I don't think you can discount your girlfriend's feelings here. No matter how honourable or platonic your intentions, you're essentially doting on another woman.

Your behavior is a little unusual. I don't think most friends would go as far as you have. Ash has a right to be upset. (BTW, she's not your girlfriend anymore.) People may think it is your baby.\n\nIs it too far though? No, I don't think so. Good friends help each other out when they're in trouble. I hope Molly is not taking advantage of a decent guy.", "This is a tough one. You don't really indicate if Molly has any other support system in place. Is she truly on her own, like if you didn't go to the delivery, would she be alone?\n\nI absolutely would stand by my friends side, but not at the expense of my partner. Ash is jealous, with no reason to be. I think you need to sit down and communicate more effectively. Ask her what her concerns are, tell her how awful it would be if your friend had nobody by her side for support.\n\nI'm going to say NTA, but you do need to decide if the friendship is more important than the relationship. Ash is already showing you that any future friendships with women will be an issue, you need to consider this long-term. Jealousy is an evil, nasty infection that will harm the relationship eventually.", "Wtf is wrong with you guys? NAH\nWhile Ash is right to be upset about you not being there for you, that does not mean she can dictate how you help your friend. If your story would have been about your sister, everyone would be on your side. How can no one see that OPs friend need help and OP want to help her out. It doenst mean they want her as a gf. Just check in with your gf if you are able to help your friend out without her being jealous.", "NTA\n\nThis is just a strong platonic friendship.

Molly and I have been friends for about four years now so as I feel bad for the situation I agreed with her to help her out. I told her she could count on my as her child's dad, that means I can take her to appointments, buy stuff from her, helping her around her apartment and whatever else she needs since I guess that she will need a lot of help now. I know that my older sister had a hard time when she had my nephew and she had my BIL around so I'm guessing it will be much nore harder to do everything alone. \n\nMy girlfriend \"ash\" (f23) is not happy with my agreement with Molly. She's basically jealous because I help molly out. For example the other day she got angry because I went to a doctor's appointment with her (I don't go in, I wait outside). Sometimes I also buy snacks and stuff that I know she likes or medicine if she needs it. \n\nMy girlfriend thinks that I'm overstepping and that I shouldn't get myself into this or people will think it's my baby. I told her that's a dumb reason to not help a friend. She also thinks I'm spending too much time with Molly now which is not ok because I always spend time with her, I don't think I'm spending more time with her now than I did before. \n\nMolly and I were talking and she said it'll be nice if I'm with her in the delivery room since I have been a lot of support for her and she'll need support while giving birth too, I told her I'd love to support her as best as I can and if she wants that then I can do it. Later me and Ash were talking and I told her this. We had an argument and she tried to get me to tell molly that I won't be helping her anymore or that I'll be helping her just a little bit during emergencies. I told her I won't do that, I already compromised to helped her and her baby once it's born, I won't take back my word now. She got upset and left, now she's not wanting to talk to me.

And well, its comprehensible that your girlfriend might not be comfortable with the idea of sharing your time and attention with another woman/family, even if it's completely platonic. Also, think of the future: What will be a priority for you?

It\u2019s a beautiful experience to witness your child being brought into the world.\n\nBut\u2026there are some awkward things about childbirth too.  For example, you prepared for the possibility that you\u2019ll see her poop on the delivery table?  Or if she has complications? \n\nMaybe you\u2019re fully aware of what\u2019s in store and totally cool seeing whatever you might see and it won\u2019t change your friendship a bit.  Who knows?\n\nBut my vote still goes for doula, if Molly doesn\u2019t have a mom or sister who has given birth to support her in the room.", "My actual husband doesn\u2019t even go to all my ob appointments with me because there is no reason for him to go.

What does putting her first mean if she is only hurt because of her jealousy? Being in a relationship doesn't mean none of your other relationships matter. \n\nIt would be a different situation if the OP was seriously neglecting his relationship with Ash, or if Molly was cruel to Ash but that doesn't seem to be the case.", "An uncle could definitely act like this if the father wasn\u2019t in the picture.

It's what's in the best interests of the child going forward with the situation at hand.", "She's like a sister to me, I feel that way towards her so it's not different than my blood related sister. \n\nYes of course I like my girlfriend, I love her", "I'm often surprised at what folks can't seem to find intuitively as off-base. I find this situation to be intuitively wrong. OP tells his woman friend he'll play baby father, and his girlfriend is naturally WTFing. I'm kind of surprised it got here.", "This. All of it.", "No, its her fault she choose him.

It\u2019s very easy to say you would since you\u2019ve never been unfortunate enough to be in that position.\n\nAlso, ETA: she\u2019s not just helping her friend in this case, she\u2019s agreeing to being counted on \u201cas a mom\u201d. That means she\u2019ll play mom. She\u2019ll prioritise the dad and the kid. She\u2019ll agree to babysit the kid at the expense of hanging out with you or take care of the child when they are sick. She\u2019ll accompany dad to the first parent-teacher conference since dad might feel nervous going on his own. But she\u2019ll try to include you of course.

I mean bro -  I told her she could count on my as her child's dad, that means I can take her to appointments, buy stuff from her, helping her around her apartment and whatever else she needs\n\nYou think you're just helping, I understand that and it's admirable to help out a friend sometimes. But that's not what you're saying, you're going too far beyond what a friend should be doing, quite frankly, and your girlfriend may not be quite sure how to verbalize this, but she feels it 100% as strange, weird, and maybe even wrong.\n\nJust don't sign the birth certificate.", "You guess.

If you love your GF as you claim and want to be with her,then you NEED to listen to her and actually hear what she is saying(if it isn't over already.) \n\nAlso,if you want to help your friend,then be there like a brother and uncle,not like a BF/husband and baby dad. Pregnant women can drive and go to doctor appointments on their own, even married women have to do this(unless there's a medical reason.) Before baby: look into Doula's and see about pulling finances together to pay for one(they'll be involved in the before, during,and after labor),look into giving a baby shower,and help with setting up baby's room(moving heavy stuff). After baby: go over a few times a week and help watch baby while mom showers/sleeps, maybe some light housekeeping,take over meals/or gift cards for food and delivery,be involved,but not as much as a dad would be.Also,you can help her take the actual father to court for support.  And, DON'T SIGN THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. Your friend is unfortunately a single mother,and she'll need to deal with this like a single mother.", "Well, you got a point here. And his actions are proving that he meant it, so... I wonder why not just be with Molly, as they are acting like a family, might as well be a real one.

Since you're on the fast track to lose her right now.", "You would not be considered your sisters baby daddy ever so why say your friend is like a sister and then also say you are being the friends baby daddy.", "I don't know how any of that works so you're most likely right, and I swear I'm not trying to be dense because if I was certain I am not doing anything wrong then I wouldn't have posted here but I don't understand why a uncle can't be like a fatherly figure? My own uncles are fatherly figures to me so I don't get why it would be different with me?", "Wild thought, women don\u2019t usually think the person they\u2019re choosing are a deadbeat outside of the weird incel fantasy you concocted.", "And he's known his gf for a bit over a year... \n\nFour years of close interaction is more than enough time to form a strong bond.", "You\u2019ve said really clearly that you intend to be a father to this baby.

That\u2019s \u2018I will put all other life plans on hold and prioritise your baby above anything else in my life\u2019.

You can\u2019t have it both ways! No woman will ever want a man to do what you are doing with your \u201cfriend\u201d \n\nAnd tbh I\u2019m sure most of us at this point are rooting for your girlfriend to dump you because even with all the answers leading to you being TA here you are just not listening.

To discipline and teach you? Did he prepare soup, spend the day taking care of you on at least half your sick days? Did he change your diapers, wake up at night to bottle and burp you? Did your uncle commit his entire life for 18 years to you? Did you spend as much time with your uncle as you did your mom?\n\nBecause that is what a father is. If you want to be a father to this kid, you are signing up for all day every day. You can be a fatherly figure, a family friend, without being a father. You are signing up, being a 'father', to putting the child and the childs mother above everything else in your life. Including your girlfriend.", "Being a father figure and being a dad are two different things. You are getting yourself into a whole mess of trouble. Wake up.", "Your uncles acted as uncles.
