I'm sorry you're being bullied. 14 is a hard enough age without that. However, I wouldn't be trying to get them to be friends with you again because they've shown you who they really are.", "NTA. You'll be thankful you aren't friends with them 10 years from now. Ask your head of year to tell them off and kick these bullies out of your life. Your worst-case scenario is becoming friends with them again after they've literally shown you their true faces.", "nta, these aren\u2019t friends of yours. if you feel as if you\u2019re being bullied and it\u2019s not just friendly back and forth or teasing, these aren\u2019t your friends. most of the time, bullying victims stay quiet about it because they feel embarrassed, which unbeknownst to them, their bullies might not just be bullying them. i would talk to your head of year about it. i\u2019m sorry man, 14 is a rough year."]}
