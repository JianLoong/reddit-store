I\u2019m also planning to start receiving my college funding for next year so I can start getting it after my last year of high school. \n\nI will say, it\u2019s not hard when you also have to do a lot of chores around the house. I can understand my dad not doing many things around the house as he works almost 50 hours a week and is really tired when he gets home, but my mum doesn\u2019t really do much except for washing clothes and maybe hoovering the carpets. \n\nI on the other hand, have to cook all the meals, clean all of the dishes they use at the end of the day (around 10-11 at night but most nights recently have gone past midnight), take care of my little sister (10, and who is NOT a nice person at all because she was spoiled rotten all her life), take care of the cats and the fish, make trips to the shop basically every day, make mum and dad coffees most of the time, plus doing my schoolwork, homework, studying, my own hobbies and actually take care of myself.\n\n(That list is longer than I thought)\n\nNow, I get that I\u2019m not paying rent, and it\u2019s really nice that they still provide for me instead of kicking me to the curb, but I honestly believe that all of this is too much to lay on top of one person, let alone someone still in high school. This has been happening for years, and on Sunday just past I ended up snapping at my mum when she asked me to go down to the shop because we didn\u2019t have much milk left.\n\nI ended up screaming at her for a good 10 minutes about all of the stress I was feeling and that I just wanted a day to myself before I went up to my room and I haven\u2019t talked much to her since except for yesterday,when I gave her my report card which showed that I was failing two of my five classes. Then she called me an asshole for not being grateful that I\u2019m not on the streets, that she wanted me to pass all of my classes even though I may feel stressed, and she told me that if I wasn\u2019t paying to live there then I was going to help around the house, but I still believe that her and my sister can do more to help instead of leaving it all to me.

You're a child and that's their responsibility.

This sounds like a tough situation to be in, but you're definitely NTA.", "From the information you\u2019re giving it seems like your mother isn\u2019t helpful, maybe you can sit down, and try to talk things out with her, maybe get your father on your side too.", "Do yourself a favor, don't sell through etsy. They take so much of the money.", "Studies come first.  Get that out of the way and THEN have time for extras.", "Well, I live in Scotland so we don\u2019t really \u201cgraduate\u201d.

Etsy will be around after you complete school.  Prioritizing etsy, which is not something that's going to start paying good money right away if it \\*ever\\* does, is counterproductive.
