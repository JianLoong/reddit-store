But giving birth is not that. It is something only you do, with your body, and it is a BIG DEAL. He does not get to have input on that . . . and you need to be really aware that his attitude towards the father-daughter relationship - and the fact that you feel safe and supported by your dad, which is a really beautiful thing and exactly as it should be - is very wrong, and not a great start to HIS fatherhood journey.

I personally wouldn't want my dad in the room with me. I had hubby and my mum and even then mum wasn't particularly interested in being there until I asked.  Have you even checked if your dad wants to be in the room? He might not want to, in which case this whole argument was pointless.", "Exactly this. If he is pathetic enough to bitch and wine about who is going to be in the delivery room then he isn\u2019t probably won\u2019t be much support as he will just be sulking", "which proves the point of OPs husband sexualizing his wife giving birth because of her genitals could be seen by a male (her dad though!!!)", "I wouldn't either, sounds kinda weird to me. And I don't blame her for saying that", "Exactly!", "They were trying to have a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment and it didn\u2019t work out lol"]}
