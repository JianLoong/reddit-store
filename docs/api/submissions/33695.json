He has several grandchildren and occasionally has one over , so \u201che looks like the good guy\u201d his words.

I cook daily meals and do interact with them however I don\u2019t want to be called grandma and he says I\u2019m an ass for not letting them and not taking primary care of them all day. He is retired I work full time albeit from home but I do work. I dont have grandchildren, my kids have elected to remain childless and I don\u2019t want that title. I said they could call me by my name. They did meet their grandma and their moms remind them of her memory. His kids only visit to drop them off. No holidays here together,no drop in visits. Their choice as they are always welcome but I feel just feel they want a free babysitter. If I\u2019m going to be out of town they\u2019ll wait till I come back to bring them over. So am I the asshole for not wanting the role or the title. Btw our relationship is on rocky ground so yes that also contributes to my position.

Doesn't sound like a man that wants to commit but rather use you. \n\nI think it's time you assert firm boundaries, If he doesn't like it he can leave. NTA", "nta - you made your position clear. also, as you said, they are 1. his grandkids, and 2. you are working (from home or not doesnt matter). If he wants to see them, then hes gotta take care of him. His behavior here leaves little to wonder why his kids don't stay to visit.", "NTA. I'm a firm believer that no one should have a nickname they don't want forced on them.", "NTA and don't budge from your position! Your bf is flat-out using you. He moved away from his kids 20yrs ago and has not worked on building a relationship with them since. You have no relationship with them. They drop their young children off at your shared home only when you are there, which proves they know HE is not doing the caregiving. He allows them to to this because it makes HIM look good, while you have to do the work of looking after them. You made it clear how you feel about this from the get go but he is pushing you to accept the role and other than the name, you ARE taking on the role. So if this is your hill to die on, dig in your heels and ensure you have a manicure scheduled the next time a kid needs caring for. Or if you are working from home, lock yourself in your office (with lots of provisions!) for really important meetings, vital deadlines etc and don't come out until the kids are gone. They cry and he doesn't know what to do? \"Call their mom, I'm unavailable!\" Time to draw the line in the sand, even if it means loosing your BF, if you are serious about not becoming a permanent babysitter.", "NTA- why do you actually do any of the caretaking? I would seriously book a massage, go to the gym, anything but take on kiddos you don\u2019t want to take on. ( I have a young child I know how hard it is)", "NTA. He's a duplicitous user now with the gall trying to push you into the name Grandma. Oh, that's rich. 20 years. Naw. Are any single one of your needs being met in this situation with him? Stick to your guns. Good luck", "INFO: \n\n* When did you find out he was still married, and why did you stay with him after learning he was married?\n* Did you not find out he was still married until \\*after\\* his wife died?\n* How do his kids feel about you, their father's mistress for over 20 years?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
