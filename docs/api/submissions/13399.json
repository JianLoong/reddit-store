They're both 6 years old.\n\nMy wife (35F) and I (36F) have him over for the day very often and our daughter goes to see him during the day as well. Overall, they're both great kids and very good friends. \n\nWe have an acquarium in the house, with 8 fish in it. Nick and Ava have named off of the fish and enjoy feeding them and spending time with them while they play in our house. \n\nNick was in our house (his parents were out and sent him over) when unfortunately, one of the fish passed away. His name was mr.bubbles. Ava and Nick were very sad and cried over him. After they calmed down, my wife and I prepared a memorial, with a grave in the backyard and a formal ceremony.\n\nNick and Ava drew pictures of mr.bubbles and they wrote a sentence from each of the other fish (mr.bubbles' friends) to read at the ceremony. We buried the pictures and the notes with him. At the very end, Nick asked if he was asleep. \n\nI already had this conversation with Ava when my wife's father passed away, so she would sometimes join me in my answers but overall, the conversation was something like this:\n\nI said he wasn't asleep, and that sleep is not the same as death. He asked how are they different. I said sleep is another way of existing for the living while death, is simply absence of life and everything that keeps someone alive. \n\nWe talked a little bit more about this, he asked if mr.bubbles would come back and I said he wouldn't but he would always exist in Nick's mind and that is very meaningful. He asked if he was in heaven and I said I don't know.\n\nThe next day, my wife got a call from Nick's mom, saying we shouldn't have talked to him about this and that we were not his parents and we were overstepping boundaries especially because they wanted Nick to believe in the concept of heaven and hell.\n\nNow I had the conversation only because he was desperate for some answers and he was comfortable, but I still wonder if I overstepped a boundary.", "created_utc": 1680013863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124qk94/aita_for_talking_to_my_neighbours_kid_about_death/", "score": 425, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If his parents don't want things said to their kid they can not use you as child care.", "I say NTA. You answered in a way that a 6 year old can understand. Also, you didn't say that Heaven didn't exist. You gave a neutral ansswer", "NTA and you didn\u2019t even go against the parent\u2019s belief system in the first place, you gave a neutral and appropriate explanation.", "NTA.  It's natural for a kid his age to ask questions, and with the situation you were dealt, you handled everything just fine.  Nick's mom can elaborate on the existence of heaven/hell with Nick.", "NTA. You gave a compassionate, factual age-appropriate explanation to his age-driven questions. Saying the fish is asleep might inspire terror.", "NTA. We\u2019re atheists and when our kids or their friends ask about it we talk about the rainbow bridge, but that we\u2019re not sure what happens. It\u2019s good for them to know it\u2019s ok to not know IMO. Sounds like you did the thing and spoke to the child at their level. \n\nI hate that we inherit religion & religiosity.", "NTA\n\nNothing like a life lesson by learning in the moment. What were the parents going to do, wait until somebody they know dies?", "NTA. At six a child should start learning about this and pet death is a common way for them to learn (as are Disney movies).  My husband died when our daughter was 5. Can you imagine how hard things are when kids deal with a parent dying as their first exposure to death?", "INFO: What kind of religion believes that fish go to heaven or hell? Oh no, you've blasphemed against the Church of Crispy Fish Fingers.\n\nThe kid's gotta learn sometime, and what you did was better than leaving a kid sad, crying and confused. Surely his parents can tell him fish aren't people and the religion doesn't apply to fish.", "By your title, I was leaning towards replying in the affirmative, but I think you dealt with an unexpected situation in an age-appropriate manner. The one thing I might have changed was, instead of answering the question about heaven, I might have asked him what he thought and encouraged him to discuss it with his parents. You might have also held the little memorial service after he left, but I think what you did was pretty benign. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI do somewhat agree this should have been a conversation his own parents had with him, but I wouldn't say you crossed any sort of line. You handled it pretty well all things considered.", "NTA. It's a fish, not a person. I would say, if a kid asks about certain topics, you should say, \"You should talk to your parents about it.\" However, he was probably asking you just to see what YOU thought about it. He might already know what his parents would say... that the fish ran away. \n\nIt's both beautiful and sad the kid had no understanding of death. My 5 yr old has been to more funerals than me because people on her dad's side are very elderly. \n\nWhen she asks me about heaven (her dad is moderately religious ever since I got pregnant with her, I am not. co parenting is fun) I just ask what she believes. At the end of the day, it's more important they make their own thoughts and beliefs rather than being told what to believe.", "NTA \"wanted Nick to believe in the concept of heaven and hell\" what the fuck?", "NTA. In no way did your response contradict their religious beliefs, you explained everything in a very rational and age appropriate way. I mean what did they expect you to do in this situation? It's not like you intended for the fish to die.", "NTA. The fish dies in front of the kid. There was no pretending. And you handles it as diplomatically as you could to allow for his family beliefs by saying you don't know where he went. You did not say, \"there is no heaven and God, kid, bwahaha. And Santa...\"", "Not an asshole.  This is a tough one, you had no ill intent.  His parents could simply explain to him that not everyone has the same values as they do.  God forbid we teach our children to value each others differences.\n\nMaybe you should have kept the conversion a bit more generic and told him to ask his parents.  You could have also given the parents a heads up, texted them, so they could have been more prepared to talk to him when he got home.", "NTA\n\nI will say you did overstep boundaries but I don't think you really had much of a choice. The one thing I would have done differently would be calling Nick's parents and explain to them what happened before the memorial.\n\nAs it stands I think you did what you could.", "NTA for explaining death to the kid, especially when he was looking for answers after your fish had died.\n\nAlso you didn't say anything that would make the kid not believe in concept of heaven/hell. They're overreacting.", "NTA. Your kids friend witnessed death for what sounds like the first time in his life, from the info you\u2019ve posted. It would have been wrong to tell him the fish was asleep and would come back later. I learned about death the same was as this poor kid, my goldfish died. I cried and cried, but I understood. Death is part of life and there is absolutely no way to avoid it. If you\u2019re lucky you won\u2019t have to experience it at a young age, but most people are not that lucky. You did a kind thing by teaching your daughters friend about death, and you did it in the most age appropriate way possible. Kudos to you!", "NTA\n\nYou gave age appropriate answers to his questions and were careful to not give an opinion on the heaven question.", "INFO - Did you say that you don't know if there is a heaven or did you say that you don't know if Bubbles was there?", "Nta at all, something happened and you explained it to him in a way he\u2019d understand and a in a way that it doesn\u2019t stop his parents from teaching about heaven and hell if they\u2019re really that into it. You\u2019re fine", "NTA.  It sounds like you handled it as best you could under the circumstances.  After all, all you said is that you didn\u2019t know what happened to Mr Bubbles after he died, you didn\u2019t tell Nick there is no heaven. \n\nIf Nick\u2019s parents do not want you answering natural questions when they arise, perhaps they shouldn\u2019t keep sending him over while they go out.", "NTA. If you had gone into a speech about your beliefs on heaven and hell it would be different. Although the parent's comment does make me wonder what a fish would do that would get it condemned to hell for eternity....", "NAH.  I don\u2019t think you said anything wrong but death is a hard topic for a 6 year old and as a parent I\u2019d want to be part of that chat with my child. I also think kids need answers to their questions.    Personally, I would have texted mom \u201cour fish just died. We want to do a memorial and bury it. Is that ok? Is child familiar with the concept of death?\u201d Or something like that.  Keep her in the loop as soon as you can. \n\nAnd, heads up, if they keep being friends, the topic of sex or body parts might come up too under your care. Same approach, keep parents as involved as you can. Maybe talk with parents on how to respond to child in the moment. Maybe a \u201cthose are really great questions and great things to want to understand but I know your mom and dad want to be able to explain it to you too so let\u2019s talk to them when they get home\u201d or something.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t give him your opinion or beliefs in heaven and hell. You said you didn\u2019t know.", "NTA- Sounds like you handled it in a kind and respectful way.\n\nSaying you \"dont know\" if the fish has gone to heaven or not is absolutely fine too.\n\nWhen i started reading i thought yes YTA because the first time a child has a conversation about death ideally it should be with their own parents but i think you handled this perfectly- besides im guessing that if you hadnt explained it to him he would have felt worse about it all - and probably just asked your daughter.", "NTA. As far as age appropriate explanations for death it sounds like you nailed it. I guess I can understand how his mother might be upset that she missed the moment or might be worried about what you told him... But as far as an intro to death for a young kid, it sounds like a pretty perfect scenario. And personally even if you're a devout Christian I think \"I don't know\" is the only appropriate response to \"what happens after we die?\"", "NTA- you didn't lie to him about death, you told it to him in words he could understand, You didn't go into detail about heaven or hell with him so his parents still can cover that aspect with him.  His mom is over reacting, as a parent i would have asked what you told him so that i could fill in the missing details and if he had more questions to ask me.", "NTA, wrong place wrong time. You did what you had to do", "NAH \n\nThe moment called for you having to step in and explain death to a child that is not your own. There was no better option. However, it would have been ideal if the parents of the child had been able to do this themselves. (No one can control when a fish dies, and sometimes things just don't go as well as we would like.)", "NTA- not really sure what the parents wanted you to do cause it\u2019s basically impossible to just brush off a 6 year old and not answer their questions.", ">He asked if he was in heaven and I said I don't know.  \nNTA - You didn't really confirm or deny anything religious, you just said you didn't know. No idea why they think a boundary was overstepped because it clearly wasn't...", "You did nothing wrong. You answered his questions. You didn't say there is no heaven or hell. You said you don't know if pet fish go to heaven. NTA.", "Gentle YTA. You were in a difficult spot, but as the mom to a kid around that age, I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with your response. Death is a big thing and families handle it differently. Ultimately they know their kid best and how their kid would best respond. For example, my kid is sensitive and scared and we\u2019ve decided to take the heaven approach. That doesn\u2019t make anyone else\u2019s choice wrong, it\u2019s just what\u2019s best for our family. They should be able to make that decision for their family.", "NTA. He asked, you answered. Their concern that you're messing with their religious beliefs (aka the concept of heaven and hell) doesn't make sense, because when he asked you simply said you didn't know. You didn't introduce this kid to an entirely different philosophy of life without his parent's consent, you just answered his question as best as you were able. You should be proud that he felt comfortable coming to you about this.", "NTA - I mean, yes, i understanding wanting, as a parent, to be able to start that conversation, but... Being snarky about you answering questions pertinent to the moment, if they are leaving you with their kid while they're out is... unacceptable. \n\nWhat did they prefer you to do?  Ignore the dead fish that they were GOING to notice??", "NTA. This was a fantastic learning experience for Nick, one handled with compassion and honesty. His parents should be thankful.", "NTA.\n\nNick saw the fish dying ... saw the burial too... how would you explain it otherwise...\nSome mumbo jumbo story would have made him go crazy..\nYou did it well...", "NTA lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Unfortunately, however the other parents may decide not to send their kid again, which truly sucks for Ava and Nick if they do that.\n\nI think your response was excellent, and the whole funeral situation and discussion sounds quite beautiful to me. You also didn't dismiss the idea of heaven and hell, so I'm not sure I understand the beef.", "NTA! You explained everything in a non-biased, rational way. It was not your fault the fish happened to leave this world at the time nick showed up, but everything happens for a reason. Maybe the universe thought nick deserved your explanation, instead of what his parents had planned.", "NTA you answered those questions really well and dealt with a difficult moment better than I would well done", "NTA, what did they want you to say? I know nothing about children so correct me if I'm wrong, but I think a 6-year-old is old enough to learn about a very basic concept of death. You explained it in a way he could understand without going too into detail. If they want him to know specific things about death, they should've told him sooner or they can tell him now.", "I don't get why they're so mad; clearly by asking about Heaven and if the fish was there, Nick already has a grasp of the concept and believes it enough to ask.  depending on their religion it's questionable if animals are even believed to go to Heaven or Hell.  certainly in Christianity it's not mentioned in the Bible though Pope John Paul II \"recently\" reversed Pius' edict that animals had no consciousness or souls, and that animals were as close to God as man.  some christians believe animals do have an afterlife, some don't.   but none of what OP said to Nick negated the fish being in Heaven, only that OP didn't know, which is *fair.*  end of the day, it's up to God, if believed in.  a person, an adult, a *parent,* should be able to say \"you know buddy, I just don't know, and that's okay.  but I know that I was happy to have had that person/pet/being in my life and I'm sad they're not now and it's alright if you're sad too\"", "NTA. Nick\u2019s parents are idiots. A fish dying is a very good way to help young kids understand death. You (correctly) didn\u2019t weigh in on Nick\u2019s theological question, so there\u2019s nothing stopping them from teaching Nick that the fish is in fish heaven. (???)\n\nWhat the hell did they expect you to say?? \u201cHe\u2019s uhhhh asleep. Also you can never see him again.\u201d Headass.", "NTA, and I would have told his parents it's called \"All dogs go to Heaven\" not all fish", "NTA at all. In fact, this is such a lovely way of explaining death to children that I\u2019m planning on using it at work (I\u2019m a therapist). \n\nPlus, by explaining this to Nick (instead of shying away from the topic as his parents wanted you to do), you implicitly taught him that death doesn\u2019t have to be a big, scary topic - it\u2019s a natural part of life and it\u2019s okay to ask questions about it. I wish more kids were being taught that.", "NTA. Do they want their kid to believe in goldfish heaven? NTA.", "The only thing I\u2019d do differently - and this is with the benefit of distance and hindsight & knowing the parents want to teach certain views - is maybe add a bit, \u201cI don\u2019t know, ask your parents, they probably do.\u201d\n\nOP is definitely NTA.\n\nETA: \u201cask your parents\u201d is my former-educator go-to lol. Gets you out of SO MANY hard conversations. Like \u201cwhat are those penguins doing?\u201d *child points to penguins that are CLEARLY FUCKING.*", "My mom is Very Catholic, and she handled the death talk similarly when my grandpa died when I was 5. \"I believe he's in heaven now, but nobody knows for sure.\" She told me some other common beliefs about the afterlife or lack thereof, and asked me what I thought. I was hoping he'd become a friendly ghost like Casper, but that didn't pan out.", "Sounds like that\u2019s exactly what the parents planned on doing. It would be easier to drive their \u201cheaven and hell\u201d agenda if they used the death of a loved family member for it.", "My mother died when I was 6. I had 1 pet die when I was 3 but I don\u2019t remember much about it. \n\nI remember Child protective services trying to explain to me what death was. All I really remember is that my brother was crying and I just wanted to comfort him. I didn\u2019t FULLY understand until I was a few years older.", "My betta fish went to hell for sure. What a jerk.", "Agree with NTA. \n\nYou kept it simple yet factual and remained neutral on the Heaven/Hell topic, as you didn\u2019t know his family\u2019s preference for this. Let his parents have the Heaven and Hell conversation if they want to, but I don\u2019t know what else you could have done better. \n\nI have a 6 year old daughter and we were discussing last night how or why people die, which was based on facts and science. I feel that it\u2019s very important for kids to understand death at a base level, without any spirituality or religious overtones.", "When I was younger, I was told in church once that only people go to heaven, not animals, because only people could earn it. I was fucking distraught. Was my dog going to hell just for being a dog? Would my dog just disappear completely? And how is heaven really heaven without my dog there?\n\nLittle did they know they were beginning the questioning that would lead me to agnostic at best lol", "I don\u2019t think you were being an asshole because of course you were consoling the kid when his fish died. Although, I do see the other parent\u2019s side that perhaps they wanted to teach their kid about certain things at certain points in the kid\u2019s life. \n\nAll families are different, and parents are different too. So maybe just be aware of that moving forward. I think there were good intentions but perhaps if something comes up like this again, redirect the kid by saying \u201coh you can talk to your parents about that\u201d and then distract the kid with something else like \u201chow about we get ice cream\u201d or something.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't sit him down and say, \"Hey kid, do you know what death is?\" You answered questions that came up within a situation you had no control over. \n\nInstead of being angry at you, his parents should use this as an opportunity to continue the discussion with him, according to whatever beliefs and customs they have.", "I've found that religious people are really weird about talking about death and in ways that are not easy to predict. I found this confusing even when I was religious or spiritual or whatever phase I was going through. NTA- your response was very neutral and even respectful.", "YTA. You might have meant well, but you should not have explained something as important as death to another parent's child. You should simply have said to ask their parents about it.\n\nI was about the same age as these kids when my father explained to me what death was. It terrified me. I screamed and ran out of the room, into my bedroom, and cried and cried and cried. Imagine if that had been the boy's reaction! You'd have had a lot to explain then.\n\nDon't explain, death, religion, or sex to someone else's kid.", "NTA R.I.P mr.bubbles. You gave him a wonderful sendoff.", "Can you imagine their reactions if you'd called them and said \"come get your son, our fish died and he's asking questions I'm not supposed to answer\"?\n\nNTA, they expected you to brush him off when he trusts you. You answered age-appropriately and put his mind at ease.", "NTA \nWe also have a fish tank but we has a mass system collapse and well lots of dead fish, our son was 3 at the time and we explained it almost exactly the same.\n\nYou didnt outright declare any religion does or doesnt exist which is honestly as neutral as you can be, especially as you dont know what his parents have told him and he was left in your care.", "NTA. This was a very mature and frank way to teach him about death, and you left it open to his parents to tell him about the afterlife. You had no way of knowing what they wanted to teach him about it (who thinks of that conversation ahead of time??). You could have told him to ask his mom but, like, did they want to get a crying toddler back when they came back home? Then they'd just be mad that you let him stay upset the whole time.", "NAH. You did a great job giving thoughtful answers for a situation that presented itself to you without the ability to prepare ahead of time. Kudos for the way you handled it. That said, concepts of death and mortality range from matter-of-fact to deeply personal and central to people's beliefs. What's more, a child grappling with those concepts can be something of a milestone for parents. It's not unfair for his parents to have wanted the first crack at it. A heads-up to his parents and briefing them on what was said to give them an opportunity to re-contextualize it would have been a courtesy.", "This reminds me of that Simpsons episode where Homer tries to protect Lisa from feeling bad and says something like \"Now she won't have to hear about death until it strikes someone she loves.\"\n\nAnyhow, NTA, you dealt with the situation that arose. They can still talk to him about all the heaven and hell stuff if they want.", "NTA. I was so ready to say \"noooo, death is a topic for parents to cover\" but given that he witnessed the departure and experienced the upset that went with it while at your house and the parents had gone out I don't think you had much choice. You gave an answer about heaven that left the way for them to instil their belief system - if someone asks me how many miles it is to the sun I can honestly say \"I don't know\" but that doesn't mean the next person they ask can't volunteer the information. Your way of explaining it was sensitive, made the important point that sleeping and death are unrelated (seen a lot of sleep issues arise thanks to not making that clear) and you also gave him the opportunity to say goodbye with your family to a pet that meant something to him. If this is his first experience of death he will probably remember it a very long time if not forever (I still remember my first experience of it at about the same age - RIP Dorothy the Guinea Pig - and I am now 41) so this explanation was important and I personally think, as a mum of 4 and with children who suffer anxiety, that you nailed it.", "You can't win ..if you mentioned heaven, you'd have a parent who would get offended ..I think you handled it brilliantly.. what did they want you to do, boot little timmy out of the house the moment it happened, leaving him crying and confused  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  some people are never happy NTA", "NTA...basically you said no comment to heaven question...the kids just happened to have his first experience with death at your house...you explained as best you could...not sure what the parents wanted from you...", "NTA. I also feel like if the parents' roles were reversed (i.e. Ava witnessed death while under the supervision of Nick's parents), they would have taken that opportunity to push religion/heaven and hell conversation onto her", "nta. you can't always be there the moment your kids will experience something new, but you can help them process it and you can show them that every one handles things differently and has different opinions. you did a great job at taking care of the situation so he would understand and hopefully speak to his parents further.", "NTA - but it would have been wise to give the parents a heads up that you had a significant conversation with Nick about death, so they could follow up.", "And if he had said, \"Yes, Mr. Bubbles is in heaven,\" there would have been some kind of rant about animals not having souls.\n\nRIP Mr. Bubbles.", "I don't think it's wrong to impart something you find comforting to your kids. It's freaky to make them constantly think they're gonna go to hell for little mistakes, but we don't have enough context to assume that's what they're doing. The kid can decide when he's older that he thinks it's bunk or not, but there's nothing wrong in telling a kid what you think about the afterlife. It's not ~ruining kids~ to tell them these things just because you personally think it's bunk. I don't believe in hell, but I'm not overrunning my nephew's mom telling him hell isn't real just because they're Catholic and I'm Jewish, HE can decide if it's real or not. Part of letting a kid form their beliefs is not dunking on the cultures they inherit, that's not antithetical to reaching them other stuff.", "I agree with you on most of that, but wonder if your NTA opinion would change if the neighbor told the kid about heaven and hell. I think I would be unhappy if the neighbor had imparted their religious beliefs about the afterlife on my child.", "I don't get the implications here, since that's exactly what OP did too. That's the easiest way to do it, even if it means kids get the talk at different ages.", "Fish probably have their own gods. They might have a story or two about Noah or Moses, but I don't think they believe in hell. \n\nI like to believe salmon have a sense of gd.

I believe in telling children the truth in an age appropriate way, which you certainly did. Nick clearly had questions and you had answers. Now if you explained sex, that\u2019s overstepping.
