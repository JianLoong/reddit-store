{"id": 611, "submission_id": "yhq1y6", "title": "AITA for getting upset at my mom?", "selftext": "For context, I am autistic and I love collecting CDs. My friends have all ditched me for other parties this weekend and my boyfriend is sick, so I was alone. I was upset about this, so my mom offered to take me to the record shop today to make me feel better. I said yes and got excited. After that, I gave her and her boyfriend the costumes I made for them and did their makeup. They went to their party with these costumes and ended up winning 4 competitions: best costumer overall, most detailed costume, most creative costume, and most accurate costume. These did involve a cash prize, a total of $150. Over text she promised to give me the money to use at the record store. When she came home, she was beyond drunk. Her boyfriend said she did shots of tequila with vodka. I helped her get out of the costume and into bed. Today, I wake up to her cleaning the yard and ask her about the record store. She said she\u2019s too hungover to do that and we can do it next week. I then asked about the money and she says she used it to buy new chair covers for the yard. I got upset and asked why if she promised I would be getting it and she called me ungrateful. She is now saying she won\u2019t take me to the record store at all and is taking away my CDs for 2 weeks. I can\u2019t take myself because my vision is too low to get a license. I may sound like an ungrateful brat but, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667164245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhq1y6/aita_for_getting_upset_at_my_mom/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
