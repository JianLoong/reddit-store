I have seen this so many times, both in my friends' families and when I did family law work. Parent A buys child clothes, Parent B keeps them and sends child back with beat up clothes. Sometimes Parent B deliberately keeps the nicest stuff so child looks good when Parent B takes them places, and Parent A has to buy more or be one-upped. Parent B never buys clothes for child, despite an equal obligation, and relies on Parent A to supply everything. This particularly happens when child outgrows winter outerwear and needs boots/coats/snowpants.\n\nYou are under no obligation to send your child in \"nice\" clothes, or contribute to the wardrobe of his step brother.  A lot of not great coparenting situations tend to end up with kids having separate wardrobes for each house because one mooches or is untrustworthy.", "\"My son is happier.\" -- That's the golden outcome - NTA\n\nUsing the clothes you buy for his brother was not limited to one tshirt w/a graphic the brother liked; it was several items over time which is entitlement: Obtaining and keeping something the parents did not buy.

You've done nothing wrong", "NTA. We have this issue with my wife's ex. The way we work it is that the clothes that we drop off the kids in, is what we pick them up in.

The same works in reverse.", "NTA- you are not there to subsidise the step kid", "NTA. Your responsibility is to clothe your child, not provide a sharing closet for your exs step child.", "Nope NTA.... My ex does this same thing with my kid...I stopped sending her in her good clothes and actually make it a point to make her change after school into something else before I drop her off....\n\nEx SHOULD provide her clothing, toiletries, and all her needs while she is there.\n\nNot sure what state you're in but you can challenge the child support in certain states. Our custody is 50/50 legally but because of the physical split my ex still had to pay CS. Tho I agreed to half what the court would have ordered.", "NTA - fight fire with fire.  Good going Mom, you have your son's back and he knows it.", "Lol definitely nta! This is the way!", "NTA. My mom did the same after my dad pulled that stunt.

Money doesn't grow on trees", "NTA \n\nAnd this is a good rationale while even when sharing custody 50/50, there needs to be a firm agreement on how school expenses, extracurriculars, medical bills, and clothes are to be handled. I've heard too many cases where this situation happened exactly as described with one coparent taking no responsibility for all the expenses that come with having child other than housing and utilities.", "NTA. \n\nShare okay. Steal? Nah. \n\nThey were stealing his clothes and giving them to the other child. Your not goodwill.", ">> I was being an asshole because they are brothers and it is normal to share clothes\n\nNope, NTA. Sharing clothes may be normal - *with consent* - but what they were doing wasn\u2019t sharing.

It was terrible for me, terrible for my sister and despite having a great deal of love for both my parents to this day, I still remember it. 35 years later, and I still remember how goddamn awkward it was to be stuck in the middle of two adults acting like children.\n\nPlease just do better, your kid doesn't deserve this.", "Had a similar situation growing up, and honestly ESH. Yeah, of course your ex shouldn't be keeping clothes you bought and lending them to the younger kid, but you're just as bad for turning your kids clothing during visits into some kind of battle with your ex instead of the two of you just discussing it like adults. \n\nAt the end of the day, your kid might be claiming he's happier, but you've successfully turned your kids clothes into a fight between you two instead of just finding a god damn solution like adults. How do you think your kid _actually_ feels about one parent dressing him in ratty clothes because the other won't stop stealing them? \n\nI can give you a hint. They feel like shit and they're telling you it's fine because they don't want to cause tension between the two most important people in their life. \n\nSource? Had the exact same shit happen to me for years with everything from clothes to toys to bloody birthday gifts, and it tore me up. I no longer speak to either parent in part because they couldn't ever be bothered to put aside their differences and do what was best for me or my siblings. \n\nSeriously, you both need to put aside you shit and stop putting your kid in the middle conflicts they have literally zero control over. Your adults, act like it. Otherwise your gonna end up with a kid that resents you both for not making the effort and instead choosing to prioritise petty conflicts.", "YTA.

I wouldn't believe they didn't know neither of them bought those particular clothing items since you would recognize what you had bought and when you asked them to return his clothes they knew exactly what to grab.
