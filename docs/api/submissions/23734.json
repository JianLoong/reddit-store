I have seen this so many times, both in my friends' families and when I did family law work. Parent A buys child clothes, Parent B keeps them and sends child back with beat up clothes. Sometimes Parent B deliberately keeps the nicest stuff so child looks good when Parent B takes them places, and Parent A has to buy more or be one-upped. Parent B never buys clothes for child, despite an equal obligation, and relies on Parent A to supply everything. This particularly happens when child outgrows winter outerwear and needs boots/coats/snowpants.\n\nYou are under no obligation to send your child in \"nice\" clothes, or contribute to the wardrobe of his step brother.  A lot of not great coparenting situations tend to end up with kids having separate wardrobes for each house because one mooches or is untrustworthy.", "\"My son is happier.\" -- That's the golden outcome - NTA\n\nUsing the clothes you buy for his brother was not limited to one tshirt w/a graphic the brother liked; it was several items over time which is entitlement: Obtaining and keeping something the parents did not buy. Don't cave to their guilt trip. Best to you!", "NTA\n\nMe and my ex share 50/50 custody of our child and I don't send the newest or nicest clothes to his house as I want them for at mine and he does the same.\n\nWe both buy clothes and keep the ones we like most at our respective homes. You've done nothing wrong", "NTA. We have this issue with my wife's ex. The way we work it is that the clothes that we drop off the kids in, is what we pick them up in. They go over there wearing Outfit A, he washes outfit A when they are at his house and they come to our house in Outfit A. The same works in reverse.", "NTA- you are not there to subsidise the step kid", "NTA. Your responsibility is to clothe your child, not provide a sharing closet for your exs step child.", "Nope NTA.... My ex does this same thing with my kid...I stopped sending her in her good clothes and actually make it a point to make her change after school into something else before I drop her off....\n\nEx SHOULD provide her clothing, toiletries, and all her needs while she is there.\n\nNot sure what state you're in but you can challenge the child support in certain states. Our custody is 50/50 legally but because of the physical split my ex still had to pay CS. Tho I agreed to half what the court would have ordered.", "NTA - fight fire with fire.  Good going Mom, you have your son's back and he knows it.", "Lol definitely nta! This is the way!", "NTA. My mom did the same after my dad pulled that stunt. Sometimes you just have to get creative", "NTA...If your son is happy with the situation, it means it had been going too far.  Nobody who hasn't been in this situation will quite understand how unnerving it is.", "NTA they are keeping things you paid for for their other son. Money doesn't grow on trees", "NTA \n\nAnd this is a good rationale while even when sharing custody 50/50, there needs to be a firm agreement on how school expenses, extracurriculars, medical bills, and clothes are to be handled. I've heard too many cases where this situation happened exactly as described with one coparent taking no responsibility for all the expenses that come with having child other than housing and utilities.", "NTA. \n\nShare okay. Steal? Nah. \n\nThey were stealing his clothes and giving them to the other child. Your not goodwill.", ">> I was being an asshole because they are brothers and it is normal to share clothes\n\nNope, NTA. Sharing clothes may be normal - *with consent* - but what they were doing wasn\u2019t sharing. They were stealing your son\u2019s nice clothing to outfit the stepson, and you were subsidizing said stepson\u2019s wardrobe. \n\n>> Now they are mad because \u201cit looks like they are poor\u201d and they are having to buy him clothes\n\n>> Since he has 50% custody he is supposed to be doing that anyway\n\nNah, they\u2019re mad because you caught on and put a stop to their theft.\n\n>> My son is happier\n\nThat\u2019s all that matters. Good job!", "Nta he didn't want to 'share' his clothes they just stole it from him.", "NTA\n\nAnother option would be to simply have him change as soon as he comes to your house, and when you send him back to dads, have him put the same clothes back on", "NTA - My ex does the same thing. My child is never sent back in what he wears there and is sent back in clothing several sizes too small. I\u2019ve started thrifting cheap things to send him back in.", "NTA.\n\nYou're never the asshole for standing up for your son.", "Why didn\u2019t you send him back in the clothes he came in? My ex would pull stuff like this, wanting his clothes back, when I bought the clothes at my house and her house, it\u2019s just silly. I think ESH because it\u2019s really simple to send him back in the clothes he came over in.", "\\>My son is happier because he has nice clothes here and there now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is all that matters.\n\nNTA", "I swear this exact post happened a few month ago.\n\nAnyway, in case you aren't a BOT or trying to create content for your TikToks, NTA", "I understand it was a means to an end, but YTA for making your son wear ratty clothes to teach your ex a lesson.", "Try talking to your ex about it again instead of sending your son over there in ratty clothing. Seems petty", "ESH except for the kid.\n\nDon't use your child to pick fights with the ex.\n\nI was placed in this exact situation many moons ago as a child. It was terrible for me, terrible for my sister and despite having a great deal of love for both my parents to this day, I still remember it. 35 years later, and I still remember how goddamn awkward it was to be stuck in the middle of two adults acting like children.\n\nPlease just do better, your kid doesn't deserve this.", "Had a similar situation growing up, and honestly ESH. Yeah, of course your ex shouldn't be keeping clothes you bought and lending them to the younger kid, but you're just as bad for turning your kids clothing during visits into some kind of battle with your ex instead of the two of you just discussing it like adults. \n\nAt the end of the day, your kid might be claiming he's happier, but you've successfully turned your kids clothes into a fight between you two instead of just finding a god damn solution like adults. How do you think your kid _actually_ feels about one parent dressing him in ratty clothes because the other won't stop stealing them? \n\nI can give you a hint. They feel like shit and they're telling you it's fine because they don't want to cause tension between the two most important people in their life. \n\nSource? Had the exact same shit happen to me for years with everything from clothes to toys to bloody birthday gifts, and it tore me up. I no longer speak to either parent in part because they couldn't ever be bothered to put aside their differences and do what was best for me or my siblings. \n\nSeriously, you both need to put aside you shit and stop putting your kid in the middle conflicts they have literally zero control over. Your adults, act like it. Otherwise your gonna end up with a kid that resents you both for not making the effort and instead choosing to prioritise petty conflicts.", "YTA. You're dressing your son in substandard clothing to get back at your ex in a petty war you're waging.\n\nI mean, your son looks homeless, but who cares as long as you stick it to ex, right?", "YTA and so is your ex, you know how traumatizing it is for kids when you use them to play your shitty little games?

For fuck sake all y\u2019all need to grow up and stop being so petty with your child.

I married my hubby (this was many years ago), he had a 6 yo daughter. I loved taking her out shopping. She would go home in her new outfit- and we never saw it again. Her mother sent her in clothes that were I'll fitting, and never sent Sunday clothes. Just other crappy clothes. Finally her Dad asked what happened to the new dress she went home in. She told us her Mom got rid of any clothes that we bought. Because she didn't like me. So.....we never sent anything back with her again. She had several nice outfits at our house, which she would wear on the weekend, if she wanted. But she would always go home with what she had brought, nothing more.

Dad refuses to return clothes and sends the child home in clothes that don\u2019t fit - leaving OP without appropriate clothing for her child. Dad is responsible for providing appropriate clothing for the child when he is there, doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s willing to do that.
