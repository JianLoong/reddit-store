I have seen this so many times, both in my friends' families and when I did family law work. Parent A buys child clothes, Parent B keeps them and sends child back with beat up clothes. Sometimes Parent B deliberately keeps the nicest stuff so child looks good when Parent B takes them places, and Parent A has to buy more or be one-upped. Parent B never buys clothes for child, despite an equal obligation, and relies on Parent A to supply everything. This particularly happens when child outgrows winter outerwear and needs boots/coats/snowpants.\n\nYou are under no obligation to send your child in \"nice\" clothes, or contribute to the wardrobe of his step brother.  A lot of not great coparenting situations tend to end up with kids having separate wardrobes for each house because one mooches or is untrustworthy.", "\"My son is happier.\" -- That's the golden outcome - NTA\n\nUsing the clothes you buy for his brother was not limited to one tshirt w/a graphic the brother liked; it was several items over time which is entitlement: Obtaining and keeping something the parents did not buy.

They feel like shit and they're telling you it's fine because they don't want to cause tension between the two most important people in their life. \n\nSource? Had the exact same shit happen to me for years with everything from clothes to toys to bloody birthday gifts, and it tore me up. I no longer speak to either parent in part because they couldn't ever be bothered to put aside their differences and do what was best for me or my siblings. \n\nSeriously, you both need to put aside you shit and stop putting your kid in the middle conflicts they have literally zero control over.

If he preferred his own clothes to his stepbrother's, then you elicited the desired result.  \n\nA bit passive-aggresively, but hey, I'm going through a separation and I *wish* passive-aggression was all I had to deal with.", "Well, if nothing else, the thread has helped me appreciate that sometimes shame and worrying about what others think can have their purposes.", "This is what was happening in my situation... the mediator sided with my ex because \"who cares what the child wears or if clothes dont stay at the original house they came from\". Too bad its in the property settlement agreement.. and also I CARE WHEN HES SENT HOME IN CLOTHES THAT HAVE HOLES IN THEM. lol", ">A lot of not great coparenting situations tend to end up with kids having separate wardrobes for each house because one mooches or is untrustworthy.\n\nI mean... the child should have separate wardrobes at both houses if it's a 50/50 split anyway? He spends half his time there. Each parent should be supplying the clothes the child will wear while they have custody", "That is hilarious and genius!", "I said the same! I went through this as a kid. It was fucking awful to be in the middle. \u2764\ufe0f", "Because then all that clothing will stay there too. Did you even read the post? The issue is all the good clothing is ending up at the ex's house causing OP to have to buy more clothing and the ex to never have to buy any.", "This reminds me of a post where the ex was selling the child's clothes. Very smart of OP here.", "My BIL\u2019s ex pulled this stunt so much it became a rule that the kid has to go to mom in the exact outfit he came to dad in.", "SM here, I keep track of all of my stepsons clothes because they disappear at BM\u2019s house. Whatever he comes to our house in, he goes back to her house in (clean, of course). We spend enough money on nice clothes for him that I would like them to be enjoyed at our house (50/50 custody).", "sexist much? \n\nMy ex wife did this shit all the time until I sent my child back to her in the same clothes he had on when I picked him up.", "This is not true what so ever, women are definitely capable of this, and I know some in my life that do this shit. Keep your sexist remarks to yourself.", "Yeah, I\u2019ve seen the mom pull this bs on her kids. Shitty parents are shitty parents regardless of sex.", "Be the bigger person and put her child first by not putting him in the middle a fair way to solve the problem is just sending him back in what he arrived in.", "Or just a child who went through shitty divorced parent wars. This problem should be solved with the adults without putting the kid in the middle.", "If it was this exact situation. . . Was your dad not letting you dress in your nicer clothes he had taken from you? \n\nBecause in reality there is no reason you should\u2019ve had to stay in the weird clothes for more than the trip to his house if your better clothes were in your step sibling\u2019s closet. \n\nWas your dad refusing to give them back? Or actually like selling or tossing them? Could your mom afford to keep buying you nicer clothes for them to not come back from dad\u2019s?", "I immediately thought of that one too. I think the best suggestions then were to send the kids over in thrift store finds they had puffy painted their names all over and tie dyed themselves.", "Is that the same one where the OP tie-dyed all the clothes the kid took to the Ex?  \n\nWas a fun kiddo project that totally ticked off the Ex.  That cracked me up!", "I remember that! Some people are really shitty.", "I put labels in allll my kids clothes. I trust no one.", "Who buys the clothes, you or your husband?", "Did you buy him clothes?\n\nYou\n\nPersonally", "The amount of bullying kids of divorce in this thread that seem to be the only one putting the kid first is absolutely absurd.\n\nThe folks that are trying to advocate for the kids emotional well being because we\u2019ve been there are being downvoted to hell. \n\nEveryone in this sub is shit today!", "I know a story of someone who put double labels in their kid's clothes.  The child had a blazer and she put one in the neck line and one below the elbow.  The blazer got stolen at school and she arranged a meeting with the thief's parent and head teacher.   The thief's parent said the blazer was their's because their name tag was in it (at the neck line) but the the original owner took the blazer and showed the name tag inside the sleeve and got it back.  The original one at the neck line had been removed and a new one sewn in by the theif's parent.", "We share. I love buying clothes for my stepson because I love to shop, so anything above and beyond is on me, but my husband always makes sure he has lots of what he needs, especially lately because he\u2019s been growing like a weed!", "fuck yes I do. I personally hand my money to the person behind the counter to put clothes on my child.", "\u201cThe dad kept them for his step son\u201d.  The dad ITAH, no question.\n\nMy point is simply that the son was used as a pawn in the game of \u201cmy divorced parents are fighting again\u201d chess.\n\nWhat\u2019s next, send the kid hungry so the other parent needs to feed him?    One parent doesn\u2019t bathe the kid, so send him back and forth until one of them relents?\n\nOr my favorite:  \u201cyour dad is a horrible person, and you should join me in hating him for stealing your clothes\u201d.\n\nKids of divorced parents have enough to deal with without being weaponized.", "Yep! I am a lawyer. One of my law partners does divorces almost exclusively. The terrible parent is pretty evenly distributed across men and women.", "Classy.\n\n\"Probably get some help\"\n\nHey guys! This random Internet asshole thinks I should get some help because..... I'm finally doing what the fuck I want? And not in a miserable marriage where I pull all the emotional weight?  I guess? \ud83d\ude05\n\nStay frosty (and a bit jealous, I imagine)", "Do you though. What does he buy for him", "Excellent. Good for you. You're not the norm, not by far, that's why you're mad about what I'm saying. 1000% that's not the normal experience. Just hang around here for a while or ask your female friends. Don't even take my word for it", "Then what do you suggest she have done?\n\nGive some solutions. Let us judge them. \n\nShe tried talking to dad and stepmom. Nothing changed. What should she have done next oh wise one?\n\nETA ALSO this would\u2019ve only been for the trip from mom\u2019 house to dad\u2019s. He had better clothes there at dad\u2019s. So he ONLY had to be in the ratty clothes for part of one day. The nicer clothes existed still, just in step brother\u2019s closet and if dad actually cared his son was in a stained t shirt all he had to do was get that Minecraft shirt out of the wrong closet.", "Fair enough, but it does explain her \"all men are garbage\" view, which is pretty shitty since plenty of single fathers out there deal with society shitting on them because of assholes like her who would rather blame all guys that accept that they had shit taste in men. She can do what she wants, but she can't act like her opinion on guys is unbiased.", "Not jealous, I'd rather not spend my forties fucking people half my age instead of dealing with my problems like a normal person, just mildly concerned. Running wild is not a healthy way to cope with a messy divorce. Therapy would help.", "Not sure I understand your first question, but he buys shoes, underwear, socks, pants, shirts, hoodies, pjs. Enough to last the week that he is here, with some extra options thrown in. He normally comes to us either in his school clothes, which I wash and send him back in, or ratty pjs.", "Good for you! You're not me, and you don't get to judge what is or is not healthy for me. It doesn't affect you, and your \"concern\" \ud83d\ude44 can fuck right off into the sunset! What sanctimonious drivel haha. Take therapy and shove it up your tight little asshole, darling. I'm the happiest I've been in years \ud83d\ude1a", "That's good and good for him. I can tell you most husbands don't know how and where clothes manifest themselves from, that they just happen", "Good for you. That blanket \"men ain't shit\" statement really screams \"I'm happy\". Denial is a bitch.", "Totally agree. We are both fortunate, that\u2019s for sure.", "More sexist nonsense"]}
