I have seen this so many times, both in my friends' families and when I did family law work. Parent A buys child clothes, Parent B keeps them and sends child back with beat up clothes. Sometimes Parent B deliberately keeps the nicest stuff so child looks good when Parent B takes them places, and Parent A has to buy more or be one-upped. Parent B never buys clothes for child, despite an equal obligation, and relies on Parent A to supply everything. This particularly happens when child outgrows winter outerwear and needs boots/coats/snowpants.\n\nYou are under no obligation to send your child in \"nice\" clothes, or contribute to the wardrobe of his step brother.  A lot of not great coparenting situations tend to end up with kids having separate wardrobes for each house because one mooches or is untrustworthy.", "\"My son is happier.\" -- That's the golden outcome - NTA\n\nUsing the clothes you buy for his brother was not limited to one tshirt w/a graphic the brother liked; it was several items over time which is entitlement: Obtaining and keeping something the parents did not buy.

They feel like shit and they're telling you it's fine because they don't want to cause tension between the two most important people in their life. \n\nSource? Had the exact same shit happen to me for years with everything from clothes to toys to bloody birthday gifts, and it tore me up. I no longer speak to either parent in part because they couldn't ever be bothered to put aside their differences and do what was best for me or my siblings. \n\nSeriously, you both need to put aside you shit and stop putting your kid in the middle conflicts they have literally zero control over. Your adults, act like it. Otherwise your gonna end up with a kid that resents you both for not making the effort and instead choosing to prioritise petty conflicts.", "YTA.

If he wants you to provide everything, he needs to be paying support. NTA", "My ex did this crap with our daughter.

Judge ripped him a new arsehole on the custody arrangement after that.", "I\u2019m so amazed that people can be so petty about clothes.

Your son is happy that's all that matters.\n\nAlso surprised his dad even bought clothes cuz every story I read the dad just complains. My favorite story was how a mom bought her kids a bunch of white clothes and did a tye dye craft and only sent the kids with that outfit. The good part was that the kids were overjoyed to do the craft so much they would choose to wear the outfit \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 so the dad should be glad you didn't resort to that", "NTA\n\nlol completely NTA", "NTA. My former daughter-in-law used to pull this shit. Then she'd claim the kids' clothes were disappearing from her house. Meanwhile, she kept sending them in clothes that were a size or two too small. So, I bought several sets of identical outfits for each of them, and my son sent them back in those outfits every time. None of those outfits ever came back. She never said a word about it, but the kids began coming in clothes that fit. I guess 12 sets of the same outfit for each kid wasn't doing it for her.", "NTA", "NTA", "Honestly it\u2019s the summer and going to the park and playing outside I wouldn\u2019t even think ratty clothes were about that but more to protect the nicer clothes. Your ex has issues. In fact I would pick up son with the clothes you bring ratty or not, not bc the brother can\u2019t wear it but because you\u2019re gonna run out of clothes.", "NTA. I had to do this. They kept keeping all the \"nice\" clothes and sending them home in clothes that were too small, stained, etc.  So I started sending them in their worst clothes.

And not having to buy clothes for his stepson.

Good job!", "NTA", "NTA, good for you.  Your ex and his wife are TA.", "NTA Clearly this worked and your child is happier because of it. Shame on father.", "NTA that's not just 'sharing', lol what is that behavior", "NTA. As you said, he should have been buying him clothes already.

Brothers, even twin brothers, should be allowed to have their own clothes.", "YTA. Why does your kid even have ratty clothes if you cam afford to buy more? His brother's  lathes aren't rattt7, you're just letting your ego get in the way here. Brother's share clothes. I agree with not sending anything that you're worried about bit getting back but you're going out of your way to be shitty and using your kid as a pawn. \n\nI have the WORST relationship with my coparent(they have a personality disorder) and I still don't send my kid in raggy ass clothes.", "NTA. If he wants 50% custody he needs to do 50% of the parenting - not rely on you to subsidize his other child.

My ex did this all the time and they don't have a child who would fit those clothes. Would seems my kiddo to school in shoes and clothes so small the teachers regularly called me because they knew I would bring proper fitting items straight away. Even had to go up to school to brush hair and teeth if it wasn't my week. \nI kept all the messages about this, so when it was possible, I got full custody with out having to do much but show the receipts.", "NTA. I used to have this same problem but it was always PJs that my son would return from his mothers house in. It went on way to long cuz as a dad I always felt like I was walking on eggshells with my ex-wife. As most can imagine there was other concerning behavior and I ended up taking her before a court ordered mediator. They told her in no uncertain terms to send him In proper clothing (also that she still had to feed him at appropriate times even if he was coming back to my home later in the day).", "NTA. My nephew will come home wearing his mom's jeans, shirts that are too small, etc. My brother stopped sending him to his mom's in anything nice or new because he would leave them at her house.", "NTA, they are! Keep doing it your way and they'll get a freaking clue!", "NTA. Seems like your ex was just trying to get out of taking care of your son, which doesn't surprise me since he took half custody so he wouldn't have to pay child support. \n\nThe first time? Whatever. Maybe they assumed that clothes would just end up getting swapped back and forth and he would have some of his step brother's clothes at your house. That is fine and is just oh hey brothers share. \n\nBut when you made sure that their kid got back his clothes, but your kid didn't get his back, that's malicious. Especially if you send him in clothes he likes, and then he has to say goodbye to them??? That sucks. At that point it seems more like they're not just stockpiling your son's clothes, but giving them to his step brother. Why would his step brother need to have your son's clothes? It's one thing to be like hey since your son only has half a wardrobe here, we had to borrow his step brother's because your son's clothes were dirty or w/e. \n\nIt's another thing for the step kid who has a full wardrobe there since that's his main home, to borrow clothes from your son, who doesn't. If he needs to borrow one outfit, fine. It should get washed and sent back. \n\nTldr they were either giving your son's nice things to his step brother, or they were keeping your son's nice things so that they did not have to get him any. \n\nEither way, it's shitty and your son deserves better. \n\nYour son is happy and has nice clothes in both places now, so that's all that matters. If he was stressed by wearing the ratty clothes, then it would be different, but it seems like he understands and is just happy that he doesn't have to leave his nice things at his dad's anymore.", "NTA - it\u2019s not your responsibility to cloth his kid", "NTA\n\nHis dad needs to step up and take care of his child. Your son deserves his OWN clothes, not to have his stepbrother getting all his favorite clothes.", "NTA", "NTA you read about this toxic stuff & this is how you handle it.", "NTA. Who are these people? Im a dad and I love buying clothes for daughter. shes not old enough to pick out what she needs but she gets so happy over simple things", "Way to go, Mom! NTA", "My daughter had to do this for almost exactly the same reason. There wasn\u2019t even a second child involved they would just keep all the nice clothes and send her home in shit. \n\nThey ended up with a routine where she had drop off clothes and she wore them to their house and she was required to wear them back home and whatever else she wore while she was there was completely financially on them.", "NTA - What happened to\n\n>they are brothers and it is normal to share clothes\n\nLooks like it only works that way if your son shares, theirs doesn't have to", "NTA. I'd have done the same if my ex and his gf had done that to our kids back when we were sharing custody (same deal, 50/50 no CS). She had girls about the same ages/sizes as our kids but they all had decent clothes. We hit some bumps but that was never one of them.\n\nWe also shared kid specific expenses. When it came time for school shopping, for example, we both threw in half the money and one of us took the kids and got everything at once. They had stuff here, they had stuff there, as long as they had the stuff they needed where and when they needed it, all was well.", "NTA. As others have pointed out, if your son is happier, that's all that matters.\n\nI'm an only child but even still, after my parents divorced I had different wardrobes at mom's and dad's. They weren't particularly different and I don't even know how much of an active choice it was. When I was a teenager it was a choice on my part, some shirts had designs my mom wouldn't like, so they stayed at my dad's. \n\nBack on track - if your ex wanted 50% custody so he wouldn't have to pay child support, then he should be contributing around 50% to care for your child, and that means buying him clothes. And if he's sharing clothes with his step-brother then they should at least buy the other boy decent clothes, it almost sounds like they're not buying any clothes for either kid.", "NTA - providing suitable clothes is part of his responsibility as a parent, especially when he wanted 50% custody.", "NTA\n\nApplause.\n\nYour son is happier. You're happier.\n\nThe only people who aren't happier are the people who were stealing your son's clothes to give to his stepbrother.\n\nOf course, 50-50 custody means his dad also buys clothes. And his stepbrother can share the nice clothes that the father is now buying.\n\nI thoroughly approve. They were trying to take advantage of your son and you.", "Your an AH.\n\nWay to punish your son, for nothing.\n\nBe honest, your just pissed, he was wearing his brother's clothes. You never said they dress him in ratty clothes.\n\nHow is a plain white t-shirt something too young?\n\nGet over your fucking self.\n\nMy brother and I went thru this bs when we were growing up.\n\nAnd now I'm watching my ex do it to out kids.", "It's convenient for OP and a win-win to her son. Plus, as stated, it's his obligation to buy clothes for his son anyway. NTA.", "100%", "This is how my ex handled things. He had his family buy clothes for birthday/Christmas,  and rest were from my house that he kept. If I insisted he buy or replace, it was with the cheapest possible option. He lost a pair of stride rite sneakers, and \"replaced\" them with Walmart flip flops....", "My stepdad use to do the exact same thing to my brother. My mum would send him over in nice, new-newer clothes and somehow they'd never manage to make it home despite my brother only being there for a day or two. She'd always remind him to pack his clothes and bring them back, if you asked him he'd swear up and down that he did pack the clothes. \n\nTurns out my step dad would go through his bag just before he left and would take an outfit a time out so my brother had nice clothes over there. Despite only having my brother for 1-2 days a week and paying diddly squat child support wise, spending $30 on a basic but new outfit for my brother was waaaaaay too much.\n\nInstead he just wore old or ill fitting clothes, which unsurprisingly made it back home everytime without fail. Unfortunately though, he never took my brother out anywhere after that because \"how can I let people see my child looking like that?\" I don't know Terry, maybe buy him some fuckin clothes.", "I had to do the same thing OP does when my ex husband was taking his visits years ago.", "None of my kid's nice clothes went with him to his dad's house. I would never get them back. There were a couple times he even brought him back in only a diaper and a tattered blanket. I ended up getting some clothes from the thrift store for his bag for dad's house ( his \"runaway bag\"). I got complaints because they were dated or thin. I told him to buy our son new clothes at his house then.", "Dealt with this! I would get so frustrated bc I couldn\u2019t afford to buy two houses worth of clothes. Or if his jacket was forgotten I\u2019d have to buy a new winter jacket- I couldn\u2019t wait the two weeks with him freezing.\n\n NTA. You found a solution to a problem that you shouldn\u2019t have needed to solve :)", "Oh gosh, an award? Thank you!", "Yes. My sister and I are only one year apart and we never shared any clothes. Kids want their own clothes.", "Maybe buy one specific colour for \"hand over\" clothes, something like neon orange or bright green or something and kid will turn up in that colour.

I have permanent guardianship of my niece and her mom NEVER buys her anything or sends her back with her items. Her dad contributes and forget once in awhile but always sends back the next visit.\n\nI would say we should call out lazy parents in general. And honestly I see more and more ain\u2019t shit mamas then dads nowadays.", "Nope my husbands ex pulled this trick so they had a wardrobe here and wore the too small stuff home.", "Nope. BM has basically held on to all sk's clothed that fit until this year, then sent him back in bad fitting or straight up filthy clothes.

She's eowe, so now whatever clothes she sends him back in, are the clothes we send him in as well. Washed and weather permitting of course", "Well, that's not always the case. I have sons, elder ones are 3.5 years apart.

I judge you more harshly than her. What she does is her business even if she shared the story on here. You actually checked on her profile and then went puritan shame on her.", "Your personal experience is great, but it is overwhelmingly not the norm, unfortunately. Projecting shoulds onto a situation where there is clearly one party taking advantage of the other is pointless. Should he be a good and responsible parent? Yes. Is he? Seems not to be.
