She didn't address the necklaces any further until we were literally walking out of the bridal salon to go down the aisle; she told my mom and I that we had to take off our necklaces and put them on the bouquets. I told my sister that I didn't want to take it off, and she told me that the tag is \"ugly\" and that I needed to put the necklace on the bouquet.\n\nThe wedding coordinator stepped in and told me that I needed to take my necklace off now, and I responded with \"It's my brother's ashes, I'm not taking it off.\" My mom immediately jumped in on my side and said that I wouldn't be taking it off, but that I could turn it around and hide it under my hair. We were pushed out the door so it ended at that. I left the tag and bead hidden behind my hair for the pictures as well and only flipped it back when we sat down for dinner.\n\nMy sister didn't interact with me at all for the rest of the day, and hasn't spoken with either of us since the wedding.

I think it\u2019s generous for you to say you\u2019d hide the tag part in your hair so it doesn\u2019t draw focus in photos (which is actually probably would? The smallest stuff can look really odd and out of place in photos). That should be the end of it. \n\nSide note, I know someone who had a custom charm made for her mom who had passed away to use on her wedding bouquet. She meant to get the charm back, but unfortunately things at the venue got mixed up and her bouquet got misplaced and she never got the charm back.

Your sister was pretty heartless about the whole thing and didn't offer any reason good enough to make such a huge ask of you and your Mom.

Just had a wedding myself and paid for it myself and I still would never have felt so entitled to ask someone in the wedding party to remove something so dear to them and use it in such a reckless way that is could endanger the safety of the item itself.
