The person paying for the apartment should know who is living in the apartment. You admitted you purposely kept this information from your father, which is a form of a lying. That\u2019s extra crappy considering he lets you live there for free.", "YTA. It's your dad's property, if you want to do whatever you want then you should get your own property where no one can tell you what to do. His house, his rules.", "YTA. Did you really threaten to leave a place you live rent free if he doesn't let someone he doesn't like live there rent free? Sounds like a win for him. He could rent it out to paying people. You are the one who will lose with that ultimatum.", "YTA, you purposely hid your friend knowing how your family felt and now you are surprise they are behaving how you expected. You asshole for hiding your friend. Your father has his reasons to dislike your friend and I'm incline to side with your father.", "YTA yeah. I want to be on your side, but lies and deceit are never good things. You knew better, but did it anyway. I hope everything works out for the best.", "YTA. You tricked your dad into paying to house someone he didn't agree to support. If you're not paying the bills, you don't get to decide who lives there. Either live by his rules or move out.", "YTA.  The home you are living in doesnt belong to you, it belongs to your parents, therefore it is their decision, not yours, to decide who stays .  Just from a liability perspective, if anything happens to your friend at the apt, she could sue your parents.  Rather than be grateful you are not having to pay rent you choose to disrespect your parents by allowing someone to live there without discussion with your parents.  You didnt discuss with then because you knew what their answer would be, which makes your decision even worse", "Soft YTA. Its great that you and your friend are there for each other. Having said that, that apartment you and your friend are living in RENT FREE is your dad's and he gets to say who stays there. You deliberately moved your friend in in secret knowing your dad wouldnt approve. It was deceitful and underhanded. Go ahead and see if you both can get a place together that is yours, then youll be able to do whatever you want there and your dad wont have a say.", "~~N AH. You made an honest mistake, and didn't think it was a big deal. It doesn't seem like you hid the fact she lived there to piss off your dad.~~\n\n~~He has the right to be mad tho. You are lucky to live rent-free, and in most places, it's mandatory to inform the landlord when someone new live in the apartment. Your dad has the right to want her gone. And you have the right to go too. No one is an asshole because of it.~~\n\nWait. Just saw you didn't tell them on purpose. YTA. It's your dad's place. You are not entitled to do whatever you want with it. That was disrespectful. I hope he kicks you out.", "the whole situation sound messed up and its clear we are only getting part of the story, but the main things are:\n\nyou should have been honest and told you dad that she was living there and then explained as logically as you can why (she helped you when no one else would, and now she needs your help for a little while)\n\ni suggest not moving out of the place you are living at rent free if it's a safe place for you.\n\nbut i do suggest opening a savings account at the bank, take the money each month that you would be paying for rent (if you had to pay rent) and put it into that bank acct.\n\nthat dollar amount varies from town to town based off allot of different factors. but at a minimum this should be $300+, you can figure out what 1-bedroom appt costs in your area and put at the minimum half of that amount into the savings acct each month and not spend it or tell anyone about it.(just let it slowly build up)\n\nif you cannot afford to save half of the rent for a 1-bedroom appt costs, then you surely cannot afford to move out of a place you live in for free. figure out a way to make more money. (Better paying job, more hours, second job etc..)", "So let me get this right:\n\nYour family hates your brother's ex-girlfriend because she gave you a place to live when you were 19. Her providing shelter to you ended her relationship with your brother. \n\nDoing that meant they lost their leverage over you, because you had an option to not live with them. \n\nYou're now living in an apartment that your family owns but doesn't use. You're letting her live with you and didn't tell them.\n\nTechnically what you're doing is wrong, but I'm not going to call you TA because your family sounds toxic AF.", "YTA for not telling your landlord you have someone living with you.\n\nNTA for who it is.\n\nNTA for telling your dad you would leave.  Frankly, your family sound horrible....you should leave and go low contact.", "ummm are the people here insane, i understand americans are obsessed with ownership and property rights or whatever but it sounds like your family isnt that great to you anyway considering you had to leave them at 19 and luckily had someone to take you in. Now, youre just returning the favor. I\u2019m not seeing the issue here its not like any of them live there or want to live there so who cares. NTA.", "Okay, so leave. Bye. Is that really going to hurt your dad's feelings to have his ungrateful, lying daughter no longer mooching off him along with her lousy friend? YTA, grow up.", "ESH. You less than Dad and Brother.  You and friend will be much happier living somewhere else.", "NAH \u2026 it sounds like your family has some issues (no offense).

You live there rent free and let someone else live there and purposefully didn't tell your dad. If  your dad wasn't your landlord you'd probably be getting evicted too.\nHe has every right to be upset and kick her out.", "YTA. Even if you were paying rent you still wouldn't be allowed to move someone else in without the owner's knowledge and consent. That you yourself are freeloading only makes what you're doing worse.", "YTA. Deceit is almost always wrong; maybe write that down.", "YTA. \n\nI don't know or need to know all the details.  But you are living rent free in your dad's place and housing someone you know he hates.  That is pretty bad.  \n\nYou know its a problem, which is why you tried to hide it.", "YTA for refusing to honor a reasonable request that you get permission to add people to an apt that you do not own or pay rent for. And you better be really sure that this is the hill you want to die on. You cannot be any help to your friend if you are both homeless.", "YTA. You withheld information for free housing for both you and someone else. If you want free choice of roommate, then you should find an apartment and sign a real lease and pay rent like an adult. If you want to be a child whose father gives you a free place to live, then you have to follow his rules. That's just how it goes.", "Yta", "YTA\n\n\nMove with her.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your appartment, you have no say on who gets to live it it. You're incredibly priviledged to live in it for free, and yet you spit on the ones who gave you this opportunity.\n\nYou want to do what you want, house whoever you want? Do like everyone else and live by yourself, pay a rent, then it will be your home and your rules.\n\nSo either kick her out and keep your lifestyle, or leave like you threatened your dad, but it looks more like a pathetic attempt to keep her in than a decision where you would have grown a spine (and honestly why would your father care if you move out too? The toll will be on you, not on him).", "YTA and I see a lot of attacks on your family and mentions of you being kicked out once in their post, did we even read the same post people? Like y\u2019all are making leaps and assumptions. OP never says they got kicked out and I doubt if the parents had kicked OP out they would then turn around and give them an apartment rent free. Seems more plausible they left bc they weren\u2019t happy at home but we won\u2019t know unless OP tells us. YTA bc it\u2019s not your place to let anyone let alone someone your parents hate live their home rent free.", "YTA point blank period. That is your father\u2019s apt and you had no right to have someone live there without him knowing and you saying you will leave if he evicts her is the biggest joke.", "YTA\n\nIt seems like theres some background since you said she took you in at somepoint, however you don't own the apartment. Your father does and he allowed you to live there rent free, not your friend.", ">I live rent free in an **apartment my dad owns**  \n>  \n>**I didn\u2019t tell them on purpose** as my dad and brother hate her\n\nsorry to say but **YTA** because **HE** owns the property, he **OWNS** it. its **HIS**. you snuck in a person to live with you and take advantage of him allowing **YOU** to live there **RENT FREE**. its **HIS** right on who **HE** allows to live in **HIS** apartment.\n\nclearly spelling it out for you. You took advantage of your father. **the apartment is not yours and thus you are not entitled to let ANYONE else live there.**", "Yta, sorry. At the end of the day it just wasn\u2019t your apartment to rent space out to anyone, let alone someone you know he wouldn\u2019t want there and for free. You can move out if you want, but having a place to live rent free is an immense privilege not to be taken advantage of. \nIf you\u2019re set on moving out, maybe you and the roommate can go in on an apartment together.", "You wish to help,your friend out as she did for you. Nothing wrong with that. How old is everyone now? You know that allowing her to live there is going to go over like a lead balloon. Be prepared to leave. Also your friend might see the writing on the wall and fall on her sword and leave. You have to know this situation won\u2019t continue much longer. It\u2019s just a matter of time. I might add as a last thought that their hatred comes from you being taken in by her? That\u2019s a funny reason for them to hate her. The fact that you were not homeless and living on the street disturbed them so much they hate the person who helped you. Some facts are missing. I see no crime in repaying the favor but you have to live with the consequences of your actions.", "NTA but you have no real recourse here and you aren't going to argue your way out of the conflict with your family. You should try to get your shit together and move out so they don't get to dictate who stays with you.", "Yeah that part puzzled me as well. They lose and dad wins. Alrighty then.", "The fact that OP feels this entitled to her dad's apartment rent free, and her dad is fine with this, tells me that there's gotta be more to this story. Parents kick OP out, get mad at someone housing her, and then give her a rent free apartment?", "Why are you assuming that the issues that led to OP leaving are due to OP\u2019s family, rather than OP themselves?\n\nOP is not paying a dime for the apartment, she is a massive asshole for just moving someone in without their parents\u2019 knowledge, let alone permission. That has nothing to do with any \u201cobsession with ownership and property rights\u201d. If you want to be charitable, you can do it with your own money and things.", "the people this post has attracted are driving me insane, why is this getting downvoted its the only logical response \ud83d\ude2d everyone else just wants to strip the issue down to property ownership/landlord rights like\u2026.", "I don't know if I'd use the word entitled. There's not enough information in her post.", "Thanks!! Super confused why this is getting downvoted lol", "She's living there. And feels she has the right to move someone else in. She's definitely acting like she can make all the decisions about it.", "YTA - it's not your place.  You took advantage of your dad's good nature.  You don't get to decide who lives in his apartment.  Also, you left out what issues you were having that caused the divide and also caused your brother to break up with her.  This is a huge piece of info.   \n Why would he break up with her for helping you?  That doesn't sound too brotherly.  Is it because the help you were looking for was because you did something to cause the issues and just ran away?  Similar to what's going on now?", "YTA. That\u2019s your dad\u2019s place.", "YTA. You know that you\u2019re in the wrong. Otherwise, you would\u2019ve been open about it. And lol feel free to kick yourself out of free housing.

You let her live there anyway.  This was going to happen at some point.", "YTA", "INFO Why did you leave their house at 19 and why did it ruin your brothers relationship?", "I don't blame  your intentions, but YTA.\n\nImagine it like this, let's say you live with your parents in the family home, and you invite this person THAT THEY ALL HATE to stay with you in your room. Would that be ok? Don't you think your parents would object and kick her out?\n\nIt's the same thing here. It's not your apartment, it's your dad's. It's not even a landlord-tenant situation, because he owns the place and you live there RENT FREE. He's simply letting his kid live in his property.\n\nYou didn't tell him because you knew he wouldn't allow it, so you sneaked around and moved her in anyway. It's his apartment, you are living there at his pleasure. You're quite lucky he doesn't choose to evict YOU as well.", "YTA. at the end of the day it is his apartment,  not yours. It\u2019s a basic courtesy to not let in a person that the homeowner doesn\u2019t like and you essentially let this person mooch off of your dad.
