Most of the parents avoided her due to her being a little rough around the edges but she didn't have the best of upbringings so has a tough exterior when shes actually a nice person. Our children are adults now. I'm married where as she is single. She doesn't work but I do so obviously I have more of a  disposable income so ive often helped her out with furniture etc when we have bought new. We are both bigger ladies however she is considerably bigger than me but keeps trying to lose weight so when I sort my wardrobe out instead of sending the clothes to charity or selling on vinted I have given them to her. Obviously at her request so when she loses weight she has nice clothes to wear. This has been happening for over 20 years and unfortunately she has only ever gained more weight. So my brother got married in April and I'd bought a beautiful designer dress to wear. Since then I've lost more weight and I'm adamant I won't be putting it back on so I put the dress up for sale on my fb. She private messaged me saying she would really like the dress. I said I don't mean to be rude but I'd like to sell it because it cost a fortune and im never going to wear it again. Ive given her thousands of pounds worth of clothing that she has never worn because they are still too small and I didn't want the dress stuck in some back bedroom.  She told me I have no faith in her weight loss and I'm being really selfish not gifting her the dress. I stuck to my guns and sold it on fb. Now she's blowing up my phone telling me she needed the dress for her granddaughters 18th birthday party which is 7 months away. When I reminded her it's impossible to lose about 6 dress sizes in that amount of time she said I'm fat shaming her. I don't feel I was I was just pointing out the obvious. Now she either ignores me or starts  berating me on fb at every chance. I'm really upset as I've tried to help her so much over the years. Last night she texted my husband and told him a secret I'd told her from my past which I'm deeply ashamed about. I'd already told my husband many years ago but now I'm worried who else she is going to tell. I don't want everyone knowing I suffered abuse particularly my children.", "created_utc": 1703871237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18tsikk/aita_for_selling_my_beautiful_dress/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

THE issue is the amount of the dress.  You sold it because you needed to recoup some of that expense.  Full Stop.  Her not fitting in it is irrelevant here.  It's about $$$ not weight.  If she comes at you again about the weight, remind her it isn't about that it's about the $$$.  WHEN she counters with \"but you already have money, why do you need more/to recoup?\"  Kindly remind her of the generosity you have shown in the past and that your finances are absolutely none of her business and if she continues to use it AGAINST you,(because of 1 dress) then you will have no choice but to cut contact with her.", "Block her on phones andxFB.
