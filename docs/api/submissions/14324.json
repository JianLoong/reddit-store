Sure. \n\nDoes it matter if you're bitter? No. \n\nThe bottom line is that she owes you money and she's showing how little intent she has on paying you back. I'm guessing she's hoping she can breadcrumb you and eventually you'll just forgive the rest of the loan. Sadly, this is why I wouldn't loan family money without discussing repayment before handing the money over to them.

Call the loan due within 60 days. It is not your concern who else she owes or for what reason. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t matter if she thinks you\u2019re an AH. Her opinion of you is not something you need to worry about because she\u2019s a selfish person who has taken advantage of you.

If I owed someone money and was going on a vaca, maybe it\u2019s a once in a lifetime chance, then I would have messaged the person I owe money to and ask if it was ok for me to take slightly longer to pay them back. I think she\u2019s taking advantage because you are family.", "NTA for wanting your money back. Don't lend her money again. She is obviously not to be trusted to pay back in a timely fashion.

She is 4000 in dept with family and goes on a holiday like that? \n\n\nSomething more reasonable would be totally fine but without this holiday she probably would be dept free AND could've made a smaller vacation", "NTA. Hopefully you told her not having the $3200 she owes you is killing your daily vibe too. She knew she owed you and your brother money before the vacation. If she had a conscience she would have thought about paying you back before the vacation. \n\nYou and your brother need to sit your sister down and demand a payment plan in writing. Remind your sister when she was at her lowest you helped her out. You're not even asking her to do that. You are simply asking her to fulfill her obligation on the loan you gave her. If you appear bitter it is from having to beg for the loan to be repaid and the hurt of your sister choosing to pamper herself in luxury over paying back her debts.", "NTA.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. If you called her out publicly you *still* wouldn't be the AH. \n\nTake screenshots of everything. When you agreed to lend the money, when you had this conversation, any time you spoke about money. You essentially have proof that she can pay, but won't. I'm not from a litigious country, so when I say that it might be worth suing her for the money, I mean it. I know you love your sister, I know you don't want to think the worst of her, but you go out of your way to help her, and she won't do the bare minimum to help you. Stop setting yourself on fire to keep her warm when the only way she would help is to hand you the match.", "NTA.
