I (32F) am currently pregnant with my first child (a girl) with my husband \u201cTaylor\u201d (31M). We are very excited about this baby as she will most likely be our one and only. She\u2019s also the first grandchild for our parents. Since I was a teen I have always wanted to name my daughter Marjorie. It is my only choice for a girls name and Taylor was fully on board with it until a week ago. \n\n\rA week ago we announced the baby\u2019s gender and name to Taylor\u2019s family. We were expecting excitement but instead his parents and sister looked pretty confused and asked if picking Marjorie was a joke. We told them no this is the named I\u2019d picked out since I was 14 and asked why it would be a joke? My in-laws turned to my husband and said \u201cMarjorie Hayworth\u2026?\u201d Taylor\u2019s face immediately changed to understanding but I was still confused so I asked who \u201cMarjorie Hayworth\u201d was. My FIL explained she was an old colleague of his who made his life a living hell for 15 years. Talking about Marjorie and her shenanigans was a common topic in their family growing up and they would refer to entitled rude people as \u201cMarjories\u201d. After he was done speaking I asked how that had anything to do with their granddaughter being called Marjorie. My SIL said that for them it would be like if I were to name my child \u201cKaren\u201d which they would never support because to them it\u2019s a name of someone who is not a good person. MIL said the name only invokes a bad feeling for them and seriously hoped we would consider a new name.\n\nI asked Taylor why he never said anything about the name before this. Apparently he genuinely forgot about Marjorie as he had moved out so long ago and hadn\u2019t heard stories about her since then but it\u2019s still a common topic of discussion for my inlaws who all live together. I told them I\u2019m sorry but this is the name we\u2019ve chosen and they\u2019re going to have to get over their weird aversion to the name. FIL asked me if I really wanted him to be reminded of someone so horrible to him every time he was around his granddaughter or had to hear her name. Taylor was not backing me up and quickly said we would pick a new name as he was no longer on board with it and was vetoing it. I am devastated. This is the name I\u2019ve wanted to use for my daughter for almost 20 years. And now I\u2019m being told I can\u2019t use it because of someone I\u2019ve never even met before? I\u2019ve been pretty cold with Taylor since then and he said I need to get over it and pick a new name because there\u2019s thousands of names to choose from. He said I have to talk to him sooner or later and we need to figure out a new name but I don\u2019t want to figure out a new name. We already chose a name and now he\u2019s only going back on it because of his family. I told him all this but he keeps saying that\u2019s too bad and he\u2019s vetoed Marjorie so we have to pick something else. So AITA for being upset my husband\u2019s family is trying to veto my baby name choice?", "created_utc": 1684860028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ptpol/aita_for_being_upset_my_inlaws_have_vetoed_my/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Done and over. \n\nYour In Laws are AH's and your husband is too for siding with them. Clearly HE didn't even remember the old \"Marjorie\" spat from years ago and wasn't the least bit bothered by it until your in laws brought it up. I don't blame you for being upset. \n\nI would maybe consider using it as a middle name. I would also WAY cool off my relationship with the in laws. They don't need to be getting any more updates about the baby's name, or anything else they can elbow in and \"veto\" if this is how they're going to act.", "Forget the in-laws.

I literally don\u2019t understand if this name was so pervasive and influential and traumatizing, how in the world could your husband have never tumbled to the correlation before? He had to be manually prodded by his family\u2026 Which tells me it isn\u2019t the emotional torment they\u2019re making it out to be.

Your husband is such an AH here. He doesn't even have the backbone to have his own opinion on the name. He loved it when you loved it. Then when his family hated it he decided he hated it. You just got bumped on the priority totem pole. You need to stand your ground here. It is just a name, but in the end if you can't even control the name of your own child because of your ILs, then why did you marry into this family? You can tell your ILs that you value their opinion, but you weren't asking for permission. If your husband can't get on your side, then to hell with him. He clearly doesn't have a strong opinion on the name and is only trying to keep the peace. This outcome will say a lot about your marriage going forward.

Also it\u2019s shitty for them to not like your name choice.", "NTA. But this is why you DON'T announce the name you plan on using. You wait till the baby is born and birth certificate is filled out to let others know. That way it's too late. (That's what we did for our kids.)", "NAH\n\nLook, you are fair to be upset. But do you really want such a traumatic and BAD association going on for your poor daughter in her grandparents' minds? Would you really feel that way if it were your parents? \n\nLike it's disappointing but I would not do that to my parents and I don't think you can expect your husband to. \n\nYour daughter will be her own person and she can rock another name that doesn't cause hurt to ppl you should value. It's tough to let go but it would be epic selfish to insist on it and really a curse to your poor daughter to have to battle against that her whole life.", "Everyone is NTA in this situation. \n\n\nOP has every right to pick the name. \n\n\nHusband has every right to change his mind about the name. \n\n\nFIL and MIL have every right to their trigger on the name. \n\n\nNo one has to be the bad guy here.

Feelings are personal and different for everyone. You were just told you'd be losing out on a name you wanted since you were a child. It's ok to be upset. Yes, it would have been easier from the outset if your husband remembered the name thing earlier, but it also doesn't mean his feelings now towards the name aren't valid either. Everyone's feelings are valid.\n\nAs for how to move forward, it can go either way. You can pick a new name and you'll get over it in time. Or you can stick with the name and your IL's will get over it in time. It's just another compromise that's part of any relationship or marriage. It looks like your husband isn't on board with the name now though, and you should both be on board for the name of your child. There's nothing wrong with comprising and discussing alternate names that you each like or dislike. This is actually probably the norm for picking names, especially for second or third born children. Maybe you can use Marjorie as a middle name, if you end up not using it as a first name.", "NTA\n\n\"Oh no, we'll have to stop talking sht about a woman that we haven't had contact with in 15 years!\"\n\nYour inlaws are being ridiculous, and your husband is blindly following because they're his parents and that makes it hard to take a firm stand with them. That being said, your husband's primary loyalties should honestly be to you, since he picked you, married you, and chose to have a baby with you. \n\nName the kid Marjorie, and if hubs wants to argue about it, you can remind him you're the one that carries the baby, and the person that is expected to take care of her, no matter the circumstances. Remind him that this baby is NOT his sister, and therefore you don't give a flying anything what his parents think about. Remind him he was totally fine with it. Remind him that his parents are still talking sht about someone they haven't seen in 15 years, and maybe it's time to retire the jokes. It's a lovely name, and if it bothers the inlaws so much, they can give her a nickname. My nephew is named Moon. I call him Rusty because he's got copper hair. I hate his name, and I would be lying if I said I didn't try to talk my sister out of it... but she named him how she wanted, and I found a workaround. I don't even call my stepkids by their names... I have \"Girl Child\" and \"Craft Kid.\" Your inlaws can do the same.", "NTA for being upset. But it\u2019s okay to explore a way to compromise if your husband truly isn\u2019t on board. \n\nThey reacted very inappropriately. It\u2019s really easy for people to put down a name when it\u2019s abstract. No one ever looks at an actual baby and shit talks their name.  Your in laws need to get over something that happened half a lifetime ago. I would say to be mindful of catering to your in laws on matters concerning your child. Right now it\u2019s the name, later it might be a different issue or boundary.", "NAH.", "nta\n\nsincerely, what the fuck. this is a hill i would absolutely die on. the only ones who need to get over something that happened like 50 years ago or so are your inlaws. utterly ridiculous.", "You are NTA for being upset, it is upsetting. However a baby name does require two yes\u2019 from both parents. You would be an ass to ignore your husband now he has said he doesn\u2019t want to. Would you be happy with Marjorie as a middle name?", "INFO: what did Marjorie do? How bad was it?\n\nI think also you should be concerned about Taylor caving to his parents, assuming Marjorie was just kind of an AH and not that seriously terrible.", "NTA...It's time for your in-laws to let this name have a new positive meaning for them.  It's also time for your husband to be a partner who has your back.", "NTA Your husband has changed his opinion and the reason why doesn\u2019t matter! You both have to approve of a baby name.

Please don\u2019t bring baby into this world with conflict.", "NTA It\u2019s yours and your husband\u2019s child, the two of you are the only one\u2019s who have any say in the name.

Proceed with your beloved name, NTA", "NTA\n\nAs people say quite frequently on here, this is a husband problem and not an in-law problem. Your in-laws don\u2019t get a say in what you name your kid.", "NTA. This is why you don\u2019t reveal the baby\u2019s name before they\u2019re born. Everyone is going to give their unsolicited opinions on the name you pick, and you\u2019re not going to please everyone with your choice. While Marjorie isn\u2019t a name I\u2019d pick, there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with it, and his family are being jerks.

Also, your in-laws didn't veto the name. Your husband did. If he backed you up, I'd be on your side. But he's not on board anymore. Doesn't make a difference that *you* wanted the name for 20 years, because *you* aren't the only one whose child it is. And now that he's remembered all his previous associations with the name, he doesn't want it anymore. Yeah, that's because of what his parents said, but it seems like he actually no longer likes the name, rather than simply trying to acquiesce to his parents' demands. Which like, I could be wrong about, and if he *is* only doing it to keep the peace with them, I'll change my view, but as it stands it really seems like he's just been reminded of reasons he doesn't want the name, rather than liking the name but not liking his parents' aversion to it. Like, he's got years worth of memories of his parents using this name to deride and make fun of people, he's allowed to change his mind for that reason. \n\nUltimately, you can be upset as much as you want, but you will still need to find a new name. NAH.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your in laws vetoing it, it\u2019s your husband. The baby isn\u2019t here and named yet, so he still has every right to change his mind. You both need to agree on the name. It sucks that he had forgotten that Marjorie has a negative connotation in his family but how that he knows he doesn\u2019t want to move forward and you need to respect that. Consider using it as a middle name or pick something new.\n\nIt\u2019s always extremely silly when people insist they get their way on a name because they\u2019ve wanted to use it for decades. If you\u2019re having a child with someone else they get an equal say on the name, and you don\u2019t get to override them because of your childhood fantasy.", "NTA like\u2026 its unfortunate for them in the moment but its gonna be a nothing burger. They\u2019ll almost surely get over it with time. If its what you want to name your baby, an inside joke from one of the families that clearly didn\u2019t stick with your hubby obviously ranks lower on the totem pole than the expecting mothers desire to name their child.", "NTA - but I personally think that's a terrible name.

I (32F) am currently pregnant with my first child (a girl) with my husband \u201cTaylor\u201d (31M). We are very excited about this baby as she will most likely be our one and only. She\u2019s also the first grandchild for our parents. Since I was a teen I have always wanted to name my daughter Marjorie. It is my only choice for a girls name and Taylor was fully on board with it until a week ago. \n\n\rA week ago we announced the baby\u2019s gender and name to Taylor\u2019s family. We were expecting excitement but instead his parents and sister looked pretty confused and asked if picking Marjorie was a joke. We told them no this is the named I\u2019d picked out since I was 14 and asked why it would be a joke? My in-laws turned to my husband and said \u201cMarjorie Hayworth\u2026?\u201d Taylor\u2019s face immediately changed to understanding but I was still confused so I asked who \u201cMarjorie Hayworth\u201d was. My FIL explained she was an old colleague of his who made his life a living hell for 15 years. Talking about Marjorie and her shenanigans was a common topic in their family growing up and they would refer to entitled rude people as \u201cMarjories\u201d. After he was done speaking I asked how that had anything to do with their granddaughter being called Marjorie. My SIL said that for them it would be like if I were to name my child \u201cKaren\u201d which they would never support because to them it\u2019s a name of someone who is not a good person. MIL said the name only invokes a bad feeling for them and seriously hoped we would consider a new name.\n\nI asked Taylor why he never said anything about the name before this. Apparently he genuinely forgot about Marjorie as he had moved out so long ago and hadn\u2019t heard stories about her since then but it\u2019s still a common topic of discussion for my inlaws who all live together. I told them I\u2019m sorry but this is the name we\u2019ve chosen and they\u2019re going to have to get over their weird aversion to the name. FIL asked me if I really wanted him to be reminded of someone so horrible to him every time he was around his granddaughter or had to hear her name. Taylor was not backing me up and quickly said we would pick a new name as he was no longer on board with it and was vetoing it. I am devastated. This is the name I\u2019ve wanted to use for my daughter for almost 20 years. And now I\u2019m being told I can\u2019t use it because of someone I\u2019ve never even met before? I\u2019ve been pretty cold with Taylor since then and he said I need to get over it and pick a new name because there\u2019s thousands of names to choose from. He said I have to talk to him sooner or later and we need to figure out a new name but I don\u2019t want to figure out a new name. We already chose a name and now he\u2019s only going back on it because of his family. I told him all this but he keeps saying that\u2019s too bad and he\u2019s vetoed Marjorie so we have to pick something else.

For good reason.", "Yeah, just letting you know since some people are getting upset at you for some reason\n\nEdit: NTA imo, that\u2019s such a weird hang up for your FIL to have, you shouldn\u2019t have to work around his baggage", "Ah, well there's a particularly detestable (IMO) politician from the deep south whose first name is Marjorie and whose middle name is Taylor (or maybe it's a second last name?)", "the one that carries the child from \\~9 months and goes thru labor and delivery for it?\n\nyeah, i'm cool with it", "I\u2019m gonna be honest, your average Canadian is not following US politics that closely, at least not enough to think of MTG immediately on hearing that name (even if they know who she is). \n\nI may eat my words in case she becomes President or something, but as things stands now, a Canadian baby can absolutely get away with that name.\n\n(I say this as someone who really does like to follow US politics and absolutely knows how vile she is.)"]}
