A lot of the activities are child friendly because of her younger brother which she finds boring\n\n3. It was a 13 hours drive which she finds really tiring\n\n4.

I talked to her mom and decided that I will also go to that city and spend some time with my daughter, for example whenever they want to do a child friendly activity I take my daughter somewhere else and she agreed\n\nMy daughter and I decided to go by plane because we both hate being on the road for a long time, then when we were there I got a room for her so she didn't have to share with anyone. We would eat breakfast together in a really nice nearby restaurant then she would spend time with her mom's family until lunch time, then I would take her out and bring her back after dinner.\n\nNow my ex is saying I'm an asshole for \"ruining\" their trip and apparently this was not what she agreed to and I made her other kids jealous because they had to watch their sister get a room for herself and eat better food and come back from shopping with her hand full of new stuff. \n\nI wonder if I was actually the asshole.

You really shouldn't have been involved in the trip and it sounds like you spend TOO much time with your daughter, but your ex needs to be more cognizant of everyone on the trip and not always cater to the youngest.  It also sounds like your daughter's \"dislike\" for \"low quality food\" needs to be addressed, either by understanding why and addressing that, or just a bit of \"suck it up\" (I know that sounds mean, but I'm not sure how else to word that) and understand that that's part of what makes the trip feasible.", "Sounds like your daughter is the asshole, and you\u2019ve taught her that it\u2019s ok to be one.", "Yeah, I\u2019m gonna have to go YTA here. 14 year olds rarely *want* to do anything with their families\u2026it\u2019s part of being a teenager\u2026but that doesn\u2019t mean you should go \u201crescue\u201d her from (what sounds like) a normal family vacation with her mom. It doesn\u2019t sound like you communicated all of your intentions (i.e. her staying with you rather that with them) and went way beyond what she was expecting as far as your involvement.", "Who has the custody for that time? If the trip was planned during your time then no. If it was planned on your ex wife\u2019s time clearly y t a. \n\nWhat is considered \u201clow quality restaurant\u201d? If it\u2019s fast food than fair but if she refuses to eat anywhere but a fancy brunch place for breakfast you\u2019re raising and enabling a brat. \n\nYou have a lot of important missing info which is usually withheld bc it makes the op look bad. So YTA", "YTA for inserting yourself into what seems like a pretty normal family vacation, and possibly turning your daughter into an entitled brat. None of the vaca stuff was going to harm her. So she's bored? Kids that age are usually bored easily. Soon your daughter will be grown and these opportunities to bond with family won't be there.", "ESH - but I think more you and daughter. You didn\u2019t really take into account the fact that y\u2019all are a blended family and created more animosity between her and her siblings. Mom shouldn\u2019t have made daughter go since she had the option to stay at home with you. Also, Mom probably took a lot of time to plan the vacation, including meals and activities that everyone can enjoy and be a part of to ensure that family had an enjoyable vacation that worked with their budget and you completely threw all that work away. Daughter doesn\u2019t enjoy \u201ccheap foods\u201d? Pretentious much?", "YTA, sounds like you are really interfering in your ex\u2019s time and raising a brat who expects to be catered to 24/7. Doubt your ex will allow this again, rightly so. Her complaints were normal things kids deal with on family vacations, nothing egregious or dangerous.", "YTA \u2013 your ex and her husband agreeing that you could join was a very nice gesture on her part. You on the other hand showed no grace whatsoever throughout this ordeal. You have not once tried to empathize with your ex, instead probably only made her life harder by making her look bad.  \n\n\nYou could have been a bigger person and used this opportunity to teach some good life lessons to your daughter, and show her how to make the best of a crappy situation but instead, you wanted to make sure that your daughter loves you more than your ex aka so you drove a wedge between your daughter and her mother on purpose.  \n\n\nYou're acting like a spoilt child which in turn sets a shitty example for your daughter.", "YTA. I mean yeah, 13 hours of driving and eating \u201clow quality food\u201d for a few days isn\u2019t the best time but it\u2019s obviously a matter of cost for your ex rather than her just wanting to make things unpleasant for your daughter. It\u2019s not a big deal to put up with these things for a few days though\u2026 your daughter could have sucked it up. \n\nOf course it isn\u2019t nice to take your daughter out shopping and have her come back to your ex\u2019s family with her hands full of new stuff (why was this even necessary? Couldn\u2019t she have just stashed it in her private hotel room without anyone seeing?). I think you wanted to come off like the super dad here but it really wasn\u2019t necessary. Eating \u201clow quality\u201d food at 14 certainly will not kill her and you\u2019re teaching her to turn her nose up at things like sharing a hotel room with her half siblings and lower-cost food, things that are done out of budget-driven necessity, and I don\u2019t think that is a good or necessary lesson to be teaching her.", "YTA and your daughter needs to stop complaining about everything and grownup. She\u2019s probably complaining so you can continue to spoil her and make the other siblings feel bad.", "ESH also you do realize you're creating a snotty monster of a child, right?", "I have one child. IF her father ever remarried, there would be no way she'd want to go on a 13hr road trip with a young kid, much less share a hotel room with 2 other kids. AND- She would rather not eat than eat random food she doesn't like just because it is someone else's norm. Not necessarily spoiled, but blended families aren't all of the Brady Bunch variety, and 14 is a really tough age- also instant 'middle kid' syndrome with which to contend.\n\nYeah, maybe OP shouldn't have 'flaunted' things like the 'international bank of Dad'- but I actually commend both parents on at least being communicative enough to attempt a work around.", "NTA, you considered your daughter's feelings and brought forth a great compromise which the ex agreed to. She can't be upset now, because her daughter is finally enjoying herself on a trip instead of being miserable. And anyone calling the daughter a brat needs to reevaluate themselves, because these are things adults complain about all the time and they're adults. You guys deal with it but don't make a child deal with it.", "Sounds like a \"dad tells her what she doesn't like\" kind of thing. I'm gonna hang up and listen", "YTA. Kids can do things they don\u2019t enjoy sometimes. I think you shouldn\u2019t have gone at all and let her do the trip her moms way. She sounds pretty spoiled.", "I'm so torn between NAH and a very light YTA.\n\nI actually don't think YTA for the activities you did with your daughter, just that you and your ex didn't talk about what the plans would be. I think it's totally fine for your daughter to spend half the day with you, and half the day with your ex, but I don't think she should be flaunting her time with you to her step-siblings, and you shouldn't pull her out any time she doesn't enjoy an activity. A fair split would be half day with mom, and half day with dad, and each side can figure out how to use their time.", "I\u2019m going with NTA! Just because you were trying to make things better and you didn\u2019t say just not go!", "NTA!! I hated sharing rooms with anyone and it\u2019s not fair that we have to all be uncomfortable but the parents get their own space. Your a good dad!! Your ex however seems to be living above her needs if she can\u2019t spare money for more accommodation and better food.. that\u2019s on her!", "YTA\nWhat you\u2019re describing is NOT what she agreed to, and it sounds like you hijacked their trip. Your daughter received preferential treatment every step of the way, which would understandably cause a rift with the other siblings. Most of what your daughter was complaining about was normal teenage girl stuff anyway, and she could have dealt with it. You\u2019re teaching her bad, spoiled behavior that she may come to expect for the rest of her life.", "NTA . If it was really a problem for your ex she should have thought about it before telling you yes, your ex's children are not your problem, you are a good father for your daughter", "YTA. The why's have been covered. Just casting my vote.", "wow... yes dude, YTA", "NTA", "YTA You ruined the vibe of a classic American family roadtrip, lol.", "YTA and you're raising your daughter to be entitled to spite your ex.", "NAH. Sounds like you guys should have had a better talk about what each of your expectations were for this arrangement.", "I'm leaning on NTA because the ex-wife agreed to you going and she wasn't mad about getting to spend less time with your daughter, but she was mad that you took your daughter out shopping and eating, so it made her other kids jealous. Unless there is more to the agreement that is being left out, then she can't be mad at how you spend time with your daughter.\n\nBut next time, clearer communication is needed for sure.", "[removed]", "You are such the AH and have now probably ruined any chance of hacing her trust you in any future negotiations. \n\nAnd you mentioned upstream that vacations are meant to be enjoyable, but that's only a part of it. They're also meant to reinforce family bonding and create memories. You stole that from your daugher which has likely limoted her relationship with her siblings, making you an AH on two fronts (to your ex and your daughter).", "YTA.\n\nWhat you did was cool.  But the fact that you didn't communicate all of your intentions to your ex is totally un-cool.   This is the sort of bait-and-switch that makes working with partners really unhappy.    Adding the plane-ride and breakfasts, which took your daughter away from their family, wasn't agreed upon.", "ESH: This so looks like a petty level of both one upping AND helicopter parenting. Then on the Moms side they don't seem to understand what age their daughter is. This is not healthy for your kid. Everyone here needs a clinician to help communicate and to respect each others boundaries.", "ESH including your daughter, and you all secretly know it.", "I\u2019m inclined to say NTA - that actually sounds like a rough trip. 13 hours in a day (with an 8 year old??) is almost abusive.", "ESH. Mom shouldn\u2019t force her kid to go somewhere that\u2019s supposed to be fun. Mom should realize it\u2019s not fun for her daughter. Family trips should make everyone happy.  OP shouldn\u2019t have tagged along on the trip and created problems for everyone.", "This is a tough one. Daughter was clearly dreading this and you made it bearable for her. On the other hand, you kind of showed them up. Daughter got a completely different trip than the rest of the blended family who was clearly on a tight budget. I guess Mom could have let the daughter pass on the trip but it doesn\u2019t sound like she could afford plane trips and higher costs restaurants. I\u2019ll say NAH- I think everyone meant well.", "Im in the minority, but NTA. Treat your daughter however you want. Time is precious.", "NTA my dad used to take each of us on a short trip or whatever separately with my sisters.  Best memories.\n\nEdit:  I am just saying if you were married to someone and invite them on a trip she would know how he was going to act - which sounds like making her more comfortable spoiling her more but I cannot see in any world that she wouldn\u2019t be aware of that", "Does your ex\u2019s family go on several holidays a year? Or is this just an annual special event?  Yes, a 13 hour car trip is excessive, but if that\u2019s what the family can afford to otherwise provide a holiday for the kids Op should respect that. \n\nYou tried to make things easier for your daughter but you absolutely sabotaged your ex\u2019s family trip. You should have discussed your involvement and been more moderate. Your actions seem deliberate. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nGoing on crappy boring vacations is a part of the childhood experience.  Your daughter would have been FINE\n\nYOU...wanted to show up your ex\n\nNothing more...nothing less", "YTA. Sounds like you still hold resentment towards your ex and using your money to make sure your daughter prefers spending time (and money) with daddy, instead of mommy. You knew EXACTLY what you were doing and you are acting coy here.", "i see a lot of people who disagree with me on this, but your daughter didn't want to go as it was, would have been miserable the whole way down, whole way back, whole time she was there and... you made it pleasant. pleasanter.  You are not responsible to provide for the other kids, thats on your ex, you made things better for your daughter, rather than your ex FORCING her to suffer the indignities of the trip, so in my book NTA.  Maybe your ex needs to upgrade her game for these family vacations, or not force your daughter to go too if she doesn't want to go.", "YTA, of course it would create animosity between siblings to have such different experiences, and why would 17yo like stuff for the 8yo any more than 14yo would? You're creating a self-centered monster who won't cope well in the real world if she's too good for \"low quality food\" at 14 and can't handle a family vacation. How will she handle work experiences? College?", "YTA- And your raising a spoiled brat. You hijacked their family vacation. Are you going to do that every time they try to have fun doing something that cost less money than something you could afford? Lots of teenagers hate going on road trips with their family, that doesn\u2019t mean someone just gets a drop in and ruin the family trip. They obviously have less funds than you, and instead of being understanding of that, you decided to show off. And your AH status and how spoiled your daughter is clearly shows in that \u201clow quality food\u201dcomment.", "This looks like a miscommunication here.  Your ex heard something else than what you were trying to portray.  Whether that's because you didn't explain it right, she wasn't listening carefully enough, or you or her changed what was really going on during the trip, we don't know.  I'm going to say NAH based on that.", "YTA. \n\nYour ex agreed that you could spend time with your child. Your ex did not agree to only having a couple of hours per day on her family vacation with said child or to the rest of it. If you wanted to take a vacation with your child then do so. The agreement was that you got the child when there was a family or child-friendly activity she didn't want to attend. That was it. There was no agreement on the rest and you monopolized the trip. \n\nAnd really? Your kid believes she is too good for homemade food and fast food?

You commandeered the whole trip. That is a major AH move.", "YTA. I think the bigger problem here is that your daughter is a spoiled brat and you're encouraging it. You obviously have more money than your ex-wife has and instead of teaching your daughter to be humble and to understand that not everybody can afford to give her all these little luxuries, you are feeding in to turning your daughter into a Kardashian. Maybe you should teach your daughter to be humble and to appreciate time with family instead of eating filet mignon versus McDonald's", "ESH I can see why you want to please your child, but she needs to learn that you can\u2019t come and rescue her every time she doesn\u2019t want to do something with your ex. That\u2019s not how it goes in real life, sometimes we need to do things we\u2019re not entirely happy with. It\u2019s not really fair on the ex either as she\u2019s probably trying to get quality time with all the kids together, and it\u2019s tough pleasing different ages.", "YTA. I feel like you know YTA, and just don\u2019t care.

It\u2019s actually all sad.", "YTA here. \n\nFamily trips are a time to bond with the family, it\u2019s normal for kids to share a room with their siblings on trips. There\u2019s nothing wrong with making your own food on a vacation to save money. \n\nA lot of teens don\u2019t like to participate in family trips but assuming your ex\u2019s family isn\u2019t toxic (which I\u2019m sure you would have mentioned), there is no harm with your shared daughter spending time with her siblings even if she\u2019s rather be doing something else. She might have even found herself having fun or bonding with her siblings, which are part of her family. \n\nIf you want a vacation with her, why didn\u2019t you just take one with the just the two of you? It really sounds like she only spent a couple of hours each day with her mom\u2019s family. \n\nA lot of parents who split custody or have visitation try to buy their child\u2019s affection. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what going on here, but you should think about that and what that teaches your child. Of course you should buy things your child needs and shopping trips are fun but if spending time with her is always shopping and eating at expensive restaurants are you really spending quality time or just spending money?", "NTA. \n\nYou weren't \\[I presume\\] trying to make anyone's trip worse, you were trying to ensure your daughter had the best experience possible. \n\nIf the other kids started to complain because you set the bar high, well, that's something for your ex and her husband to address.\n\nThat said, the reasons you listed are elements of living in a mixed family, and things that are good to become tolerant of.\n\n If you start to reinforce that she doesn't have to learn to adjust to that, you are potentially setting up a zero-sum relationship between your daughter and your ex. If your daughter starts to think of time with her mother as, like, \"having to share space with people and be grateful for 'low quality' food,\" then it's super possible she starts to project that dissatisfaction onto her mother. \n\nSince her mom has a responsibility to 3 children, she necessarily won't be able to spoil them all as much as you can spoil your daughter \\[assuming vaguely relative income levels\\].\n\nNone of that is any reason not to give your daughter every joy and advantage you can, but just be mindful of how you affect her relationship to that very real other half of her family.", "YTA. You're kid sounds like an entitled brat and you're just enabling her. Vacations aren't  always going to be super awesome fun time, especially for a 14 YO teen girl, but it's not just about your kid.

And it sounds like you are doing your best to raise another little asshole. Kids don't need comfort and luxury 24/7. A normal part of a kid's life is being part of a family, and sometimes...\\*sometimes\\*, you are not the only person that matters.

I cannot look at the feelings of an 8 year old as \"collateral damage\" to his daughter having  better, fancier food.", "I mean, there's a difference between being a pretentious snob and not wanting to eat greasy fast food all the time, the latter of which seems to be a better description of the daughter. \nAnd I agree with OP (from comments) that, while traveling when money is tight is going to look different than when you have a larger budget, the point of a family trip is for everyone to have fun. If OP made the trip better for the daughter, great. Yeah it sucks that the other kids didnt have an equivalent experience, but that's not on OP.\n\nETA: if OP was rubbing others' noses in how they provided the daughter with a better trip, then yeah def an AH move. But I hesitate to assume that.", "She wanted to use them. I know I'd look gorgeous with those new earings but they were hers to use so she took them woth herself", "I used to think I was above certain kinds of food and accommodations at 14, too, and we weren't rich. It's definitely an upbringing thing.", "They mean that you are very influential in what she doesn't like.  That maybe the reason she hates \"low-quality food\" is because you turn your nose up at it.\n\nAlso what is low-quality food?\n\nWhat are the family activities she didn't want to do?\n\nAnd was there anything you did with her that wasn't shopping?\n\nThese are important questions and I really would like to know cause my judgement depends on them.", "She would not have been miserable the entire time. You and she are dramatic children. \nThe point of a family trip is everyone gets to do stuff together. Sometimes it's not exactly what you want because it's what someone else wants. And you SUCK IT UP for family time. \nYou and your daughter need to learn that she's not the center of existence. She can be bored occasionally. She won't DIE from it. You are creating an entitled shit.\nOne day she'll ditch you for being boring or not spending enough on her and your will be so shocked. But we won't.", "My parents weren\u2019t divorced but even when my mom was on our trip we always had seperate dad time.  Dads and their daughters?", "Well kind of is - the ex wife agreed and it seems like they had a lot of their own quality time so?\n\nEdit: from OP other comments of making her comfortable etc I am sure the ex wife knew damn well that he would be probably taking her to nicer places etc", "How much of that is because you are already spending extra on her than her mom can spend on her and her step-siblings? - flight, hotel room, shopping in this case?", "Yep, and I am sure her college suite mates (cause you know she's getting a single) will just love her.", "She's 14 and old enough to know that not everything revolves around her. She being a bit over the top and that's normal at 14 but what's not normal is how much you are enabling her. Eating homemade and \"low quality\" food and sharing a room on vacation is not something you need to save her from.", "She likes to be comfortable. I bet her half siblings like to be comfortable too. I've read posts on here about bringing food and treats for children but not for the half siblings and thought, \"Wow, what an asshole!\" This post gave me the same vibe. \"You guys go to McDonalds. My dad is taking me to a great restaurant.\" \"Look at my new clothes and stuff!\" \n\nIt sounds from your own post that the siblings were well aware of the differential treatment. Not surprisingly, that created problems for mom. If you were really trying to be kind to your ex and build your daughter to be a better person, you might try raising her with an awareness that everything is not all about her and her preferences. You could even have given the ex's family a gift card to a restaurant they could not afford if you wanted to be the hero. You, instead, flaunted that you were better off and your daughter gets better stuff than her siblings. YTA.", "Everyone likes to be comfortable. The difference is that most people don't have someone who will enable our desire to be comfortable 100% of the time. And that is a good thing. \n\nYour child would not have been harmed by not having a high-quality restaurant meal three times a day. She would not have been harmed by having to attend one or two things she didn't prefer. She does not need a constant life of luxury. \n\nYou can bet this is the last time your ex allows this type of arrangement.", "Nothing is wrong with it actually!", "She isn't a mind reader and this is a dick response.", "So the burden for knowing OP's intention is on the person hosting the trip? Is that narcissism in action?\n\nDaughter went shopping separately and got NOTHING for the siblings?  And the fault for being jealous o the generous gifts is on the siblings, right,not on the daughter for flaunting this in the siblings' faces?  Entitled much?\n\nOP YTA - completely sabotaged ex-wife's family trip, CREATING a much worse situation than daughter being 'bored'. \n\nA GOOD parent would help the daughter find the value in the time with family, learn to be generous about and have fun with siblings older and younger, at MOST offer to pay for separate room for ALL THREE teenagers, and have a separate trip with daughter, if OP wants to spend special time together.\n\nYTA and creating a real brat with these choices.", "I respectfully disagree. I think communication is critical. From your ex's perspective, she might have thought you were trying to \"show her up\" or buy brownie points with your daughter. Now, were you doing this? Probably not - you sound like a good dad and not the type to do something like that. But I really think all the special things you were going to do for your daughter should have been discussed. \n\nI'm inclined to say NAH, but in the future I would definitely try to be more communicative, or YWBTA.", "I can see why she is your ex.  Also, you are raising your daughter to be spoiled and entitled.  Good job.", "I would put money on the young one being a picky eater and going to McDonald's a lot.", "Cheap fast food. She is pretty picky about her food and likes to cook her own food. Her cooking is pretty good for a kid her age.\n\nYes we did a lot of other activites", "Somebody never sat on there ass for 13 hours and then had a room with siblings and it shows", "Yeah no, being family doesn\u2019t mean you put yourself in an uncomfortable situation for them. It\u2019s very unfortunate that you think so", "I mean that is totally different though. It was a family trip and parents got individual time.", "Yeah not the same at all then", "sounds like she didn't", "Ugh so what? I can't give her anything because her half siblings can't have them? Am I supposed to not buy a car for her when she turns 18? Should I stop putting money in her college fund? If they want to be comfortable their parents should make them comfortable", "Why would he do that when one of the things she hates about the trips are that tickets have to stay in the room together?", "Clearly not but again The OP has said she knows how he is,  I just sounds like if the wife want her to sleep on the floor and eat with everyone else you do not bring your ex have him fly her down to start with.   I find it hard to believe married to someone and having a 14 year old that she would have been so caught off guard by this.  \n\nSimple solution don\u2019t bring your ex to make it more comfortable for her if you want all kids treated the same.", "Does she live with them full time and how old was your daughter when you for divorced?", "keep digging.", "Exactly.", "Her stepsister and half brother are old enough to learn that they won\u2019t get everything their step/half sister get. If your ex wants them to be equal, then they can put the effort into it!", "No we have 50/50\n\n2", "Well then no If you can send your daughter to college and get her a car at 18 your her dad.   Yes I understand the half siblings are not going to get the same but they aren\u2019t your kids.   \n\nIt\u2019s just a fact with divorce especially her living with you 50% she is going to have more advantages because it is one child but also not your responsibility to control your ex wife\u2019s finances with her husband and how they choose to spend their money on their kids. \n\nI know unpopular opinion but she is your daughter and If you choose to treat her to nice things that is your choice.  I mean as long as you aren\u2019t creating a total spoiled monster."]}
