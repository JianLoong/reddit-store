A lot of the activities are child friendly because of her younger brother which she finds boring\n\n3. It was a 13 hours drive which she finds really tiring\n\n4.

You really shouldn't have been involved in the trip and it sounds like you spend TOO much time with your daughter, but your ex needs to be more cognizant of everyone on the trip and not always cater to the youngest.  It also sounds like your daughter's \"dislike\" for \"low quality food\" needs to be addressed, either by understanding why and addressing that, or just a bit of \"suck it up\" (I know that sounds mean, but I'm not sure how else to word that) and understand that that's part of what makes the trip feasible.", "Sounds like your daughter is the asshole, and you\u2019ve taught her that it\u2019s ok to be one.", "Yeah, I\u2019m gonna have to go YTA here. 14 year olds rarely *want* to do anything with their families\u2026it\u2019s part of being a teenager\u2026but that doesn\u2019t mean you should go \u201crescue\u201d her from (what sounds like) a normal family vacation with her mom. It doesn\u2019t sound like you communicated all of your intentions (i.e. her staying with you rather that with them) and went way beyond what she was expecting as far as your involvement.", "Who has the custody for that time? If the trip was planned during your time then no. If it was planned on your ex wife\u2019s time clearly y t a. \n\nWhat is considered \u201clow quality restaurant\u201d? If it\u2019s fast food than fair but if she refuses to eat anywhere but a fancy brunch place for breakfast you\u2019re raising and enabling a brat. \n\nYou have a lot of important missing info which is usually withheld bc it makes the op look bad. So YTA", "YTA for inserting yourself into what seems like a pretty normal family vacation, and possibly turning your daughter into an entitled brat. None of the vaca stuff was going to harm her. So she's bored? Kids that age are usually bored easily. Soon your daughter will be grown and these opportunities to bond with family won't be there.", "ESH - but I think more you and daughter. You didn\u2019t really take into account the fact that y\u2019all are a blended family and created more animosity between her and her siblings. Mom shouldn\u2019t have made daughter go since she had the option to stay at home with you. Also, Mom probably took a lot of time to plan the vacation, including meals and activities that everyone can enjoy and be a part of to ensure that family had an enjoyable vacation that worked with their budget and you completely threw all that work away. Daughter doesn\u2019t enjoy \u201ccheap foods\u201d? Pretentious much?", "YTA, sounds like you are really interfering in your ex\u2019s time and raising a brat who expects to be catered to 24/7. Doubt your ex will allow this again, rightly so. Her complaints were normal things kids deal with on family vacations, nothing egregious or dangerous.", "YTA \u2013 your ex and her husband agreeing that you could join was a very nice gesture on her part. You on the other hand showed no grace whatsoever throughout this ordeal. You have not once tried to empathize with your ex, instead probably only made her life harder by making her look bad.  \n\n\nYou could have been a bigger person and used this opportunity to teach some good life lessons to your daughter, and show her how to make the best of a crappy situation but instead, you wanted to make sure that your daughter loves you more than your ex aka so you drove a wedge between your daughter and her mother on purpose.  \n\n\nYou're acting like a spoilt child which in turn sets a shitty example for your daughter.", "YTA. I mean yeah, 13 hours of driving and eating \u201clow quality food\u201d for a few days isn\u2019t the best time but it\u2019s obviously a matter of cost for your ex rather than her just wanting to make things unpleasant for your daughter. It\u2019s not a big deal to put up with these things for a few days though\u2026 your daughter could have sucked it up. \n\nOf course it isn\u2019t nice to take your daughter out shopping and have her come back to your ex\u2019s family with her hands full of new stuff (why was this even necessary? Couldn\u2019t she have just stashed it in her private hotel room without anyone seeing?). I think you wanted to come off like the super dad here but it really wasn\u2019t necessary. Eating \u201clow quality\u201d food at 14 certainly will not kill her and you\u2019re teaching her to turn her nose up at things like sharing a hotel room with her half siblings and lower-cost food, things that are done out of budget-driven necessity, and I don\u2019t think that is a good or necessary lesson to be teaching her.", "YTA and your daughter needs to stop complaining about everything and grownup. She\u2019s probably complaining so you can continue to spoil her and make the other siblings feel bad.", "ESH also you do realize you're creating a snotty monster of a child, right?", "I have one child. IF her father ever remarried, there would be no way she'd want to go on a 13hr road trip with a young kid, much less share a hotel room with 2 other kids. AND- She would rather not eat than eat random food she doesn't like just because it is someone else's norm. Not necessarily spoiled, but blended families aren't all of the Brady Bunch variety, and 14 is a really tough age- also instant 'middle kid' syndrome with which to contend.\n\nYeah, maybe OP shouldn't have 'flaunted' things like the 'international bank of Dad'- but I actually commend both parents on at least being communicative enough to attempt a work around.", "NTA, you considered your daughter's feelings and brought forth a great compromise which the ex agreed to. She can't be upset now, because her daughter is finally enjoying herself on a trip instead of being miserable. And anyone calling the daughter a brat needs to reevaluate themselves, because these are things adults complain about all the time and they're adults. You guys deal with it but don't make a child deal with it.", "Sounds like a \"dad tells her what she doesn't like\" kind of thing. I'm gonna hang up and listen", "YTA. Kids can do things they don\u2019t enjoy sometimes. I think you shouldn\u2019t have gone at all and let her do the trip her moms way. She sounds pretty spoiled.", "I'm so torn between NAH and a very light YTA.\n\nI actually don't think YTA for the activities you did with your daughter, just that you and your ex didn't talk about what the plans would be. I think it's totally fine for your daughter to spend half the day with you, and half the day with your ex, but I don't think she should be flaunting her time with you to her step-siblings, and you shouldn't pull her out any time she doesn't enjoy an activity. A fair split would be half day with mom, and half day with dad, and each side can figure out how to use their time.", "I\u2019m going with NTA! Just because you were trying to make things better and you didn\u2019t say just not go!", "NTA!! I hated sharing rooms with anyone and it\u2019s not fair that we have to all be uncomfortable but the parents get their own space. Your a good dad!! Your ex however seems to be living above her needs if she can\u2019t spare money for more accommodation and better food.. that\u2019s on her!", "YTA\nWhat you\u2019re describing is NOT what she agreed to, and it sounds like you hijacked their trip. Your daughter received preferential treatment every step of the way, which would understandably cause a rift with the other siblings. Most of what your daughter was complaining about was normal teenage girl stuff anyway, and she could have dealt with it. You\u2019re teaching her bad, spoiled behavior that she may come to expect for the rest of her life.", "NTA . If it was really a problem for your ex she should have thought about it before telling you yes, your ex's children are not your problem, you are a good father for your daughter", "YTA. The why's have been covered. Just casting my vote.", "wow... yes dude, YTA", "NTA", "YTA You ruined the vibe of a classic American family roadtrip, lol.", "YTA and you're raising your daughter to be entitled to spite your ex.", "NAH. Sounds like you guys should have had a better talk about what each of your expectations were for this arrangement.", "I'm leaning on NTA because the ex-wife agreed to you going and she wasn't mad about getting to spend less time with your daughter, but she was mad that you took your daughter out shopping and eating, so it made her other kids jealous. Unless there is more to the agreement that is being left out, then she can't be mad at how you spend time with your daughter.\n\nBut next time, clearer communication is needed for sure.", "[removed]", "You are such the AH and have now probably ruined any chance of hacing her trust you in any future negotiations. \n\nAnd you mentioned upstream that vacations are meant to be enjoyable, but that's only a part of it. They're also meant to reinforce family bonding and create memories. You stole that from your daugher which has likely limoted her relationship with her siblings, making you an AH on two fronts (to your ex and your daughter).", "YTA.\n\nWhat you did was cool.  But the fact that you didn't communicate all of your intentions to your ex is totally un-cool.   This is the sort of bait-and-switch that makes working with partners really unhappy.    Adding the plane-ride and breakfasts, which took your daughter away from their family, wasn't agreed upon.", "ESH: This so looks like a petty level of both one upping AND helicopter parenting. Then on the Moms side they don't seem to understand what age their daughter is. This is not healthy for your kid. Everyone here needs a clinician to help communicate and to respect each others boundaries.", "ESH including your daughter, and you all secretly know it.", "I\u2019m inclined to say NTA - that actually sounds like a rough trip. 13 hours in a day (with an 8 year old??) is almost abusive.", "ESH. Mom shouldn\u2019t force her kid to go somewhere that\u2019s supposed to be fun. Mom should realize it\u2019s not fun for her daughter. Family trips should make everyone happy.  OP shouldn\u2019t have tagged along on the trip and created problems for everyone.", "This is a tough one. Daughter was clearly dreading this and you made it bearable for her. On the other hand, you kind of showed them up. Daughter got a completely different trip than the rest of the blended family who was clearly on a tight budget. I guess Mom could have let the daughter pass on the trip but it doesn\u2019t sound like she could afford plane trips and higher costs restaurants. I\u2019ll say NAH- I think everyone meant well.", "Im in the minority, but NTA. Treat your daughter however you want. Time is precious.", "NTA my dad used to take each of us on a short trip or whatever separately with my sisters.  Best memories.\n\nEdit:  I am just saying if you were married to someone and invite them on a trip she would know how he was going to act - which sounds like making her more comfortable spoiling her more but I cannot see in any world that she wouldn\u2019t be aware of that", "Does your ex\u2019s family go on several holidays a year? Or is this just an annual special event?  Yes, a 13 hour car trip is excessive, but if that\u2019s what the family can afford to otherwise provide a holiday for the kids Op should respect that. \n\nYou tried to make things easier for your daughter but you absolutely sabotaged your ex\u2019s family trip. You should have discussed your involvement and been more moderate. Your actions seem deliberate. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nGoing on crappy boring vacations is a part of the childhood experience.  Your daughter would have been FINE\n\nYOU...wanted to show up your ex\n\nNothing more...nothing less", "YTA. Sounds like you still hold resentment towards your ex and using your money to make sure your daughter prefers spending time (and money) with daddy, instead of mommy. You knew EXACTLY what you were doing and you are acting coy here.", "i see a lot of people who disagree with me on this, but your daughter didn't want to go as it was, would have been miserable the whole way down, whole way back, whole time she was there and... you made it pleasant. pleasanter.  You are not responsible to provide for the other kids, thats on your ex, you made things better for your daughter, rather than your ex FORCING her to suffer the indignities of the trip, so in my book NTA.  Maybe your ex needs to upgrade her game for these family vacations, or not force your daughter to go too if she doesn't want to go.", "YTA, of course it would create animosity between siblings to have such different experiences, and why would 17yo like stuff for the 8yo any more than 14yo would? You're creating a self-centered monster who won't cope well in the real world if she's too good for \"low quality food\" at 14 and can't handle a family vacation. How will she handle work experiences? College?", "YTA- And your raising a spoiled brat. You hijacked their family vacation. Are you going to do that every time they try to have fun doing something that cost less money than something you could afford? Lots of teenagers hate going on road trips with their family, that doesn\u2019t mean someone just gets a drop in and ruin the family trip. They obviously have less funds than you, and instead of being understanding of that, you decided to show off. And your AH status and how spoiled your daughter is clearly shows in that \u201clow quality food\u201dcomment.", "This looks like a miscommunication here.  Your ex heard something else than what you were trying to portray.  Whether that's because you didn't explain it right, she wasn't listening carefully enough, or you or her changed what was really going on during the trip, we don't know.  I'm going to say NAH based on that.", "YTA. \n\nYour ex agreed that you could spend time with your child. Your ex did not agree to only having a couple of hours per day on her family vacation with said child or to the rest of it. If you wanted to take a vacation with your child then do so. The agreement was that you got the child when there was a family or child-friendly activity she didn't want to attend. That was it. There was no agreement on the rest and you monopolized the trip. \n\nAnd really? Your kid believes she is too good for homemade food and fast food?

You commandeered the whole trip. That is a major AH move.", "YTA. I think the bigger problem here is that your daughter is a spoiled brat and you're encouraging it. You obviously have more money than your ex-wife has and instead of teaching your daughter to be humble and to understand that not everybody can afford to give her all these little luxuries, you are feeding in to turning your daughter into a Kardashian.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with making your own food on a vacation to save money. \n\nA lot of teens don\u2019t like to participate in family trips but assuming your ex\u2019s family isn\u2019t toxic (which I\u2019m sure you would have mentioned), there is no harm with your shared daughter spending time with her siblings even if she\u2019s rather be doing something else. She might have even found herself having fun or bonding with her siblings, which are part of her family. \n\nIf you want a vacation with her, why didn\u2019t you just take one with the just the two of you? It really sounds like she only spent a couple of hours each day with her mom\u2019s family. \n\nA lot of parents who split custody or have visitation try to buy their child\u2019s affection. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what going on here, but you should think about that and what that teaches your child. Of course you should buy things your child needs and shopping trips are fun but if spending time with her is always shopping and eating at expensive restaurants are you really spending quality time or just spending money?", "NTA. \n\nYou weren't \\[I presume\\] trying to make anyone's trip worse, you were trying to ensure your daughter had the best experience possible. \n\nIf the other kids started to complain because you set the bar high, well, that's something for your ex and her husband to address.\n\nThat said, the reasons you listed are elements of living in a mixed family, and things that are good to become tolerant of.\n\n If you start to reinforce that she doesn't have to learn to adjust to that, you are potentially setting up a zero-sum relationship between your daughter and your ex. If your daughter starts to think of time with her mother as, like, \"having to share space with people and be grateful for 'low quality' food,\" then it's super possible she starts to project that dissatisfaction onto her mother. \n\nSince her mom has a responsibility to 3 children, she necessarily won't be able to spoil them all as much as you can spoil your daughter \\[assuming vaguely relative income levels\\].\n\nNone of that is any reason not to give your daughter every joy and advantage you can, but just be mindful of how you affect her relationship to that very real other half of her family.", "[deleted]", "I mean I see it both ways.\n\nBut tbh I don't think you're the asshole for sparing your daughter a forced family bonding trip.\n\nThe ex should have said no to you coming if she didn't want to share the kids attention with you.", "INFO.

A 13 hour road trip is rough but doable and sharing a room with family memebers happens. Here are the issues I think are the most egregious:\n\n1. You seem to have taken your daughter for most of the vacation. You claim to a) have bought her a room b) have breakfast with her c)spend lunch and afternoon with her d) bring her back for dinner. Sounds like her mom and their family only really got to see her for 4-6 hours a day. Not to mention you took her away during child-friendly activities.

You encroached on their vacation by doing what you did. Your ex agreed to having you in the same vacation, but not on you taking your daughter away from the family. Could you not let your child go for one vacation? Sure, she might not like the circumstances (sharing a room, less than perfect food, kid activities) but as a co-parent you should never try to make yourself better than the other parent.

But little Princess felt that she\u2019s too good for that. Instead of helping her vote this as a great way to bond with her family and spend time with them, you hijacked it. Go you. You\u2019re so cool. You didn\u2019t go along and make her more comfortable. Stop telling yourself that fairy tale.

You are doing your daughter a disservice by this behavior. I do, however, hope you will live forever because as soon as daddy isn\u2019t able to find this type of lifestyle, daughter will be loving a lonely life. The only people who will want to be friends with someone who complains nonstop about their being less than (their taste in food isn\u2019t good enough, they don\u2019t fly first class, they didn\u2019t get such nice things from dad) and intentionally wave brand new stuff in their face are people equally as shallow, narcissistic, and awful as she is.

Sharing a separate room from our snoring parents would have been an absolute dream.", "My family used to all room together in one room. Sometimes when I/my sister brought a friend somebody slept on a cot. We made do because we weren\u2019t completely spoiled rotten.", "What is this even supposed to mean? \n\nLike. Legit. As a response to the comment above, what does this mean?\n\nWhat was said that wasn't true?", "An adult isn\u2019t forced to do things they don\u2019t want to do? C\u2019mon, most of us spend at least 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, doing something we\u2019d rather not be doing for a paycheck. Even if you like your job, most people would prefer to spend time with their family or on their hobbies instead of making money for other people.", "No, almost everything she complained about was a result of not having a lot of money.  He already raised a spoiled kid and is just enforcing that.  \n\nHe should have let her not go because the mother was too poor to cater to her whims I guess.\n\nA 14 year old can have fun at a place an 8 year old can", "Daughter legitimately hates the trips. Why force it?", "Fair enough. Thanks for clearing that up", "Okay so the 17, 8 year old have different dad's?", "So the 17 year old was actually your stepdaughter for quite a while?? Wow. SMH.", "Definitely not. It is pretty shitty to be rude about it to the people who are bringing you there, though. My family loves chain restaurants and when I was growing up that\u2019s all they could afford. I\u2019m not a fan of that kind of food but never said anything bad about it, they were just trying their best to give us nice experiences. I got a job when I turned 14 and explored good restaurants with my friends on the weekends. She gets to eat the way she prefers on her dad\u2019s time, she should be able to cope with Chili\u2019s or whatever on her mom\u2019s time.", "It's one thing to not like it as an everyday meal. It's quite another to look down on it as a 14 year old child who isn't the one footing the bill when your parent is trying to do something nice for you. If that's what the parent can afford for a vacation, the kid should be grateful instead of running to the wealthier parent to complain.", "Chain restaurants are fine. Like OPs wife, not everyone is blessed to consistently afford nice restaurants and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nOP interfering robs the daughter of being taught that not everyone has the capability to afford nice things.", "Ooh, classism.", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, I\u2019m not even remotely trying to defend him, just that I don\u2019t blame the daughter for being picky in this scenario depending upon what is causing her to be picky", "So instead of getting her to a nice restaurant he could have bought the ingredients and made a nice meal for everyone, but as his replies stand I just think that the daughter thinks she is better than the rest of the family (but also this behavior was nurtured by the father.)", "I recall sharing a motel room with all my family...I had to sleep on the floor and woke up covered in flea bites. It's not one of my favorite family travel memories.", "Same, except it was all 5 of us.", "I never went on a family vacation full stop. And when the state paid i was 15, we stayed in a caravan (trailer).\nI'm from the UK", "You weren't spoiled rotten, but grew up to be a bitter adult", "They can get a different job. I know plenty of adults that don't take abuse in the workplace so they've been through a lot of jobs. Adults settle. Also who doesn't want money. Most want money more than they hate their jobs. So their wants outweigh it. It's still an active choice. The difference is an adult can quit, a teenager can't just leave. They are FORCED to stay with absolutely no say in the matter, the same can't be said for adults. I mean technically you can choose to be homeless and not have a job. Adults have a choice.", "She didn't want to share a room with an 8 year old boy or anyone for that matter as a 14 year old girl. And other than the homemade food the cheap greasy fast food they get will almost 100% cause stomach pains/problems. Also a custody agreement is a custody agreement, you don't just get to change it. It seems it was the mother's time. So they talked about the vacation and came to a compromise. In some places both biological parents have to consent for one to take the kid out of state/country. From the reaction here he would've been in more \"trouble\" if he refused to let her go.\n\n>A 14 year old can have fun at a place an 8 year old can\nI guess we were VERY different at 14.", "because she has two step siblings that she should try to get to know and have a relationship with", "I figured the 17 year old belonged to the new husband", "So because the child is only 14, they should just suck up eating food that probably makes them feel sick? The child probably would have preferred not go on the vacation at all given a choice. Sounds like you endorse using money to demand respect and control from your children, which is an ineffective parenting technique in my mind.", "Ah sorry, I was not trying to say you were defending the father...  \n\n\nBut I do not know because I grow up poor..so always I read this posts I can not for the life of me understand this \"pick eating\" stuff, there were times that I all i had for lunch and dinner was \"potato soup\" (my mother really did know how to make a meal with the means we had) and I never thought of saying \"I will not eat this\".  \n\n\nI know people have different tastes but for 14 year old be this demanding I just think it is wrong.", "No, I grew up to be an adult who thinks there\u2019s nothing wrong with sharing a hotel room for one week.", "I\u2019m not talking about abuse in the workplace, I\u2019m talking about how much of our finite existences we are required to spend doing labor so that we can have things like a house and electricity. \n\nYou can\u2019t tell me you would still prefer to spend most of your earthly life working if you could put food on the table and a roof over your head without doing that. It\u2019s not \u201cwanting money\u201d it\u2019s needing to eat so you don\u2019t die and having to pay to eat and sit on a plot of land.\n\nSaying \u201cyou can choose to be homeless\u201d is kind of disingenuous, don\u2019t you think? The kid could choose to run away and live on their own on the streets. Same vibe.", "From what OP has said it's not about the step siblings it's the trip itself she doesn't like.", "right, she doesn't like being with the parent who makes less money because she has to eat on a budget and share with siblings on a vacation - it's entitled behavior, she's not sacrificing anything"]}
