I am assuming that your cousins coming into town on their anniversary will never be allowed to happen because it will happen too close to their child\u2019s birthday you know, forever.", "NTA, you're not the baby's parent, have your own life, you yourself said you're estranged...\n\nKind of entitled of her to think that the lives of all her birth family must revolve around her birth. A soft AH for her, as she's probably overwhelmed with all the changes.", "NTA. Why care about someone you don't keep in touch with having a sulk because not everything is about her. Enjoy the wedding.", "NTA. The cousins wedding is important. It\u2019s a one time thing. There\u2019s no need to see the baby the second they\u2019re born. \n\nWe had a situation like this where my family was in one city and my cousin was getting married in another. My grandfather became very sick and was maybe going to die on the wedding day or around that time. We all agreed that we can\u2019t just ALL not go to my cousins wedding. He can\u2019t skip his wedding and he needed family support. \n\nIn the end grandpa passed right after my cousin returned from his honeymoon so nobody missed his final days.", "Nope, NTA unless you're her midwife/doctor which I'm  guessing you aren't. Why exactly she wants you to stay home? Is this some sort of competition with the cousin or something? She wants to be the most important person?", "NTA - Youre missing a family event to go to another also important family event. Being pregnant can do weird things to you hormonally and make you not the most rational person at times. She probably doesn't realize she's being a bit extra, but maybe she's hurt / feels like you don't care about her major life event. She will get over it, I wouldn't stress it.", "NTA. I mean, it seems unreasonable to expect you to miss a vacationish trip just because it is her due date.  Babies don't always come on that date anyway.  I mean, mine came 6 weeks early.  (That is of course, not the norm) but how would you feel missing this trip and then the child arrived 3 days later?  Is she expecting you to be there every moment?  Based on your level of closeness, I would think that was unreasonable.  I lived 3 plus hours away when my sister had her first baby.  I think I made it by the weekend, though I am not positive, as I didn't want to push on her either.  I would be willing to bet this is hormonal and she has no idea how crazy life will be adjusting to a new little person.  She might welcome not having you there right away.", "NTA   the only person who needs to stay home is her husband.   And there is o guarantee  baby will  arrive same weekend as wedding. \n\nGo have a good time", "NTA. She\u2019ll come crawling back a couple days after the baby is born, wanting help, eventually a babysitter etc. \nIts great that she is having a baby, but the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her because of it.", "Info \u2014 did your sister ever ask you to be there when she goes in to labor?", "NTA. Unless you are the one who is supposed to deliver the baby, then your presence is neither required or needed at that moment. This may be an 'important event' in your sister's eyes; but the world does not revolve around her, and there are other Real Life obligations going on simultaneously. Expecting anyone besides her SO to drop everything and come running just to hold her hand and witness her shining moment is a bit entitled.", "NTA.  I missed my niece getting born to take my friends to see the first Harry Potter movie. I didn\u2019t even meet her till a few days later when the parents were ready. There was never a plan for me to be there.  What was I going to do at a maternity award that both grandmoms and the father couldn\u2019t do?\n\nMy niece adores that story and thinks it is hilarious.", "NTA -  she may be emotional, let it ride.   Stop texting her.", "NTA. This is not your child and actually in the first few days the baby and momma are supposed to meet less people to avoid spreading of diseases to them while the immune system is weak. Give her some space to think about it, make sure you prepare a gift/card/flowers to be delivered when she is in the hospital on your behalf (at least this way she will know you did think of her ahead of time, you haven't forgotten, etc).", "NTA just because she's having a kid doesn't mean you have to put your life on hold and ait around for it. You'll see the kid when you get back. Go enjoy the wedding", "NTA at all. Your sister has a support system and you will visit later on. Enjoy the wedding.", "NTA, it's a tentative date unless she is having a planned c section or something. The baby could very well be a few days late or early and you would be there.

But she is allowed to be disappointed.  Obviously she can't go to this destination wedding.  *(Pet theory:  She may be secretly mad at your cousin for not rescheduling the wedding and wants your whole family to boycott it.)*\n\nRegardless I think your parents are right.  It is good that you are going to represent the family, so your parents can stay and be there with your sister.\n\nAlso, first babies never come on the due date.  She may deliver before you leave or 2 weeks after you come home.\n\nI suggest that you keep your plans and stop trying to apologize or make your sister understand.  She will come around when she comes around.", "NTA if you are lucky you might see the baby from a distance but you aren\u2019t going to be doing much else - they will be totally distracted and she will be tired - they will barely notice if you are there or not.  Better to wait until they are settled.  She is being ridiculous.", "Nah, for one she won't be giving birth right on due date, almost no one does. And second I just don't get it how could you help being there?", "NTA. It's really hard to plan around a due date. Your sister's baby easily could be born two weeks before the wedding and you would have cancelled for nothing. Being gone for a couple  of days for a major event should not be a big deal, especially if you'll still be able to see her and baby in the first week of life.\n\nHonestly, my wife never wanted anyone else in the delivery room anyways. I'm surprised she wants you there so much.", "NTA\n\nBaby could come early, late or anywhere in between, also, it\u2019s good to limit the number of visitors in the first couple of weeks to reduce the risk of bub and/or mum picking up a bug.\n\nGo to the wedding to represent your family, come back and when you have quarantined yourself, go visit your sister and offer to watch bub whilst she showers, has a cuppa or a nap etc to make up for not being there sooner; I\u2019m sure she would appreciate that far more when the time comes than having you there sooner just to see the baby.", "NTA. Sounds like she wants to be the centre of attention and how can that be so if you\u2019re not waiting on her? You don\u2019t need to be there just to see the freshly born child, unless you\u2019re part of her medical team.", "Giving birth is not a team sport. NTA.\nEnjoy the wedding!", "NTA\n\nUnless you\u2019ll be in the delivery room, a few days won\u2019t make a difference. You\u2019re close to your cousin and want to be part of her wedding. That\u2019s how it goes sometimes. Your niece/nephew will hopefully have years of your time together.", "NTA. Wedding is a planned event. Your sister has no idea when she is going to give birth. As well, you are not her doctor to be there with her. What does she expects you to do? Not going anywhere around a month around the due date? \n\nYou said you are not even close so you are not going to be with her during delivery or helping her settle during first days at home. It is ridiculous to think you should miss the wedding because she might or might not have a baby then and she thinks you should visit her immidiately.", "NTA \n\nYou can\u2019t please everyone bc it\u2019s not physically possible.

It\u2019s honestly more thoughtful of you to wait until you aren\u2019t a health risk after flying to come see her and the baby, not every woman is so lucky to have family that prioritize baby\u2019s health over their own selfish need to see baby ASAP.", "NTA\nAm...

If you're just a not super close sibling who understands that babies rarely arrive on their due date who wants to live an enjoyable life, NTA.", "NTA, your sister is due not you. She wants your attention not your presence. Go enjoy the wedding and see the baby when a natural occasion presents itself.", "NTA.  Who keeps their calendar open for other people's births?

How free does she expect people's calendars?", "NTA. You have to live your life. What if the baby comes a little early? Now you miss the wedding. What if the baby comes a little late?

Have a blast. When your sister gets over her emotional butt hurt feelings go meet your new nephew. Pregnancy/post-pregnancy hormones are real but she should eventually level out.", "NTA Go to the wedding and celebrate your cousin's marriage. Later, celebrate your niece/nephew's birth.

Obviously her sister feels like she's missing the day her baby is born. A baby being born is still a family event, so is a wedding. She doesn't need to be there when the baby is born.", "I think your sister is just jealous that you get to attend the destination wedding & she is stuck waiting around for this baby to show up.
