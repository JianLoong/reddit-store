However,  it'd be rude to basically tell her you're not attracted to her by encouraging her to diet and exercise.

And before y\u2019all kill me just hear me out. I completely agree. If you demand it OP or try to force it YTA. HOWEVER I don\u2019t think your intentions are malicious based off of reading this. I may be wrong but that\u2019s not the impression I\u2019m getting. I (25m) am overweight as well and am in a relationship with someone (30f) who isn\u2019t. My amazing gf has always made me feel comfortable and confident with myself. Im very bear-ish and she has expressed that she likes it very much. We have however had open discussions and communications about having a more \u201cfit\u201d lifestyle together. Let me make it clear she has never demanded it from me. And that\u2019s something I have always appreciated and valued. I agreed to make the changes because I love her and want to be the best possible man I can be for her. Now in your situation I\u2019m happy you made a life choice that has affected you in such a positive way however moving forward your actions will speak to the kind of person you are. I believe open discourse and discussion in a relationship is necessary and healthy and your case is no different but there is a right way and wrong way to do it. And if you end up finding you don\u2019t share the same values anymore then that\u2019s perfectly fine. It just means you\u2019re not compatible anymore.", "Soft YWBTA. I don\u2019t think there is any harm or disrespect in trying to involve your partner in healthy activities that can contribute to weight loss (gym, outdoor activities, meal planning/cooking together etc). What crosses into YTA territory is if you come across as demanding or word things in such a way that it makes her feel insecure or bad about herself. Ultimately it\u2019s her choice what she does with her body and lifestyle. She is aware of the fact she\u2019s overweight so she doesn\u2019t need a sit down condescending \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d type conversation about it. If she doesn\u2019t have the desire to make significant changes to her lifestyle then you might just need to accept you aren\u2019t as compatible as you once were and move on.", "YWBTA.  If she expresses to you that she wants to lose weight and asks for advice, then go ahead. Until then, don't say anything to her about it. The other option would be to leave the relationship, and honestly sounds like she may be better off without you.", "YWBTA. \n\nShe was this size when you met her, so there's no reason to bring up her weight in terms of attraction/her changing. \n\nShe has seen you lose weight, so if she wanted your advice to lose weight herself, she would ask about it. \n\nIf because you have changed, you are no longer interested in a relationship with her, then break up with her. As an overweight person myself who lost a significant amount of weight I get that if your lifestyles are no longer compatible (aka you are very active and she isn't interested/able to do the same things as you) you don't want to stay with her. \n\nAnd also as an overweight person, knowing you were as well, I have to say - come on dude. Fat people know we are fat. We try and fail at multiple diets, some things help, a lot doesn't. If your girlfriend was interested in replicating your success, she would ASK for your help. It would be remarkably cruel for you to now tell your partner, who is the same person she was a \"few months ago\" when you started dating that she should lose weight. And you know that, but you can't help yourself because now you see yourself in a new way and think she would just be better too, and that's not how life works. \n\nThe only thing you can do is if SHE raises something about wanting to lose weight, you could then offer your help and advice. If she says \"the doctor said X, I really need to lose weight\" then you can say \"well you know my journey, and I'd be happy to go to the gym with you/meal prep/support\" but any unsolicited conversation about how you can help her is an AH move.", "Obviously YWBTA .\n\nIf you don't like her as she is you're under no duress to stay with her.", "You mentioned the word look before feel which leads me to believe that this is simply a physical attraction thing?\nAm I right?\n\nBut yes YWBTA, if she asks you then you are good. But any conversation you start makes you definitely TA", "You would probably push her away from you if you push this too hard.  You first need to find out how she feels about her weight.  No one wants to be overweight, but for many this is a lifelong pursuit to lose weight and many just don't know how to attack it.   Let her come to the  conclusion and then you can offer suggestions but it's a tricky conversation to have.", "YTA she looked like that when you started dating and now you want to change her", "YWBTA. The only way you lost that much weight is if you were taking Ozempic or a doctor prescribed weightless drug. OR it was water weight. Alot of obese people have hard time losing weight for various reasons but one is that the fat holds too much insulin (why they are sometimes diabetic) {my Doctor told me that btw}\n\nBefore you tell her anything, remind yourself how you would feel if someone told YOU what YOU needed to do with your health. You aren't her doctor, don't know her diagnosis etc. You sound like a shallow AH\n\n>I (23M) have been dating this woman (27F) for a few months.

From the start, both of you were overweight, and you knew exactly that she was overweight as well. Within the 4 months, you lose over 60 lbs which is incredibly fast (and imo unmaintainable once you go off your current diet) and your opinion of your gf changes because you changed. Your gf is still the same person. Your weight loss and ego changed you. You now say that if your gf doesn\u2019t try to lose the weight, you\u2019ll consider breaking up with her? I\u2019m sure there were other reasons why you liked her besides her weight/size. \n\nI would be upset if I had a SO tell me that I was too overweight for them and that I either had to lose weight to keep them or they\u2019ll leave and I stay the same. \n\nI think you should decide whether or not you want to stay with her asap to not waste her time. \n\nIf you choose to stay with her, you can see what activities she\u2019s interested in that you may be as well and plan dates around that ex. walk/talk in the park, hiking/sightseeing, kayaking/swimming, visiting a museum, etc with a picnic/lunch with healthy foods and a special treat you both enjoy. These are fun ways for ppl to be active as well as enjoy each others company (for most ppl \u2026I think). \n\nDo NOT sit her down and tell her she should go to the gym with you and start dieting.", "YWBTA. She knows she's overweight. She doesn't need you to tell her. You'll just be letting her know that you don't love her unconditionally.", "YTA. Unless you are her doctor (which would be unethical, since you are dating), you have no business telling someone to lose weight.", "YTA.

You made a rather drastic change to your lifestyle and want to be healthier. But now you want that in other aspects of your life, including your partner. I'd just make sure you are being honest with your intentions here. I don't really buy into the \"big is beautiful\" crap. Yah, it's healthy to have a lil bit of chonk, but excess weight is unattractive and detrimental to health. And there are a LOT of factors that go into weight gain and it can be extremely difficult, mentally and physically, for people to lose that weight.\n\nWhy do you want her to lose weight, really? And does she WANT to? Is she even capable of it?\n\nMaybe it's just because you're a lot physically healthier now, and you want a physically healthier partner that's more physically attractive.\n\nMaybe you are healthier and want her to be healthy too because there are more benefits to health if you are in a healthy weight range.\n\nMaybe you are just not attracted to her anymore or think you can do better. Maybe you want this for you. \n\nWhatever the intentions, if you need her to lose weight to be happy, approach the conversation humbly and cautiously, without any kind of judgement. You were just obese yourself, after all. If it's because you aren't attracted to her anymore, tell her that. Be honest. It's better than lying and breaking up later down the road. If it's because you want to do more healthy activities and you want her to be a part of that, tell her that. Be honest. Tell her you want a long and happy life with her and you want to help her get her weight down.\n\nBut if she doesn't want to lose weight, will you still be happy with her? Or will you resent her for it? Better to just end it then, but DO NOT degrade her or make her feel like she's at fault here.

B.S. I\u2019ve only seen that on my 600 lb life.", "YTA. \n\nFirst of all, if she wants your help she will ask for it. There is nothing more frustrating than unsolicited commentary. \n\nSecondly, you claim you only care about her health but what you have done is far from healthy. By your own account you lost 60lb in four months, eating mostly lean meat and veggies. Let\u2019s crunch some numbers. A recommended healthy weight loss target is a maximum of 1-2lb per week. There\u2019s about 17-18 weeks in four months, meaning a healthy rate of weight loss would have been around 20-30lb, 40 at the absolute maximum. So you\u2019ve doubled the rate vs what is considered healthy. You did so through a highly restrictive diet, which has been shown over and over to be unsustainable for the majority of people. Those who lose weight rapidly through highly restricted eating habits and very low calorie diets are very likely to gain it back and more besides. Slow adjustments to diet and lifestyle are far more sustainable in the long term. \n\nMaybe what you did works for you. Maybe you\u2019ll be an outlier and keep the weight off. But four months of personal journey does NOT qualify you to be giving weight loss advice to anyone else. \n\nWhether your girlfriend continues to make weight loss progress slowly and steadily, or decides to can the whole thing altogether, is none of your business.
