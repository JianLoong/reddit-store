However,  it'd be rude to basically tell her you're not attracted to her by encouraging her to diet and exercise.

And before y\u2019all kill me just hear me out. I completely agree. If you demand it OP or try to force it YTA. HOWEVER I don\u2019t think your intentions are malicious based off of reading this. I may be wrong but that\u2019s not the impression I\u2019m getting. I (25m) am overweight as well and am in a relationship with someone (30f) who isn\u2019t. My amazing gf has always made me feel comfortable and confident with myself. Im very bear-ish and she has expressed that she likes it very much. We have however had open discussions and communications about having a more \u201cfit\u201d lifestyle together. Let me make it clear she has never demanded it from me. And that\u2019s something I have always appreciated and valued. I agreed to make the changes because I love her and want to be the best possible man I can be for her. Now in your situation I\u2019m happy you made a life choice that has affected you in such a positive way however moving forward your actions will speak to the kind of person you are. I believe open discourse and discussion in a relationship is necessary and healthy and your case is no different but there is a right way and wrong way to do it. And if you end up finding you don\u2019t share the same values anymore then that\u2019s perfectly fine. It just means you\u2019re not compatible anymore.", "Soft YWBTA. I don\u2019t think there is any harm or disrespect in trying to involve your partner in healthy activities that can contribute to weight loss (gym, outdoor activities, meal planning/cooking together etc). What crosses into YTA territory is if you come across as demanding or word things in such a way that it makes her feel insecure or bad about herself. Ultimately it\u2019s her choice what she does with her body and lifestyle. She is aware of the fact she\u2019s overweight so she doesn\u2019t need a sit down condescending \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d type conversation about it. If she doesn\u2019t have the desire to make significant changes to her lifestyle then you might just need to accept you aren\u2019t as compatible as you once were and move on.", "YWBTA.  If she expresses to you that she wants to lose weight and asks for advice, then go ahead. Until then, don't say anything to her about it. The other option would be to leave the relationship, and honestly sounds like she may be better off without you.", "YWBTA. \n\nShe was this size when you met her, so there's no reason to bring up her weight in terms of attraction/her changing. \n\nShe has seen you lose weight, so if she wanted your advice to lose weight herself, she would ask about it. \n\nIf because you have changed, you are no longer interested in a relationship with her, then break up with her. As an overweight person myself who lost a significant amount of weight I get that if your lifestyles are no longer compatible (aka you are very active and she isn't interested/able to do the same things as you) you don't want to stay with her. \n\nAnd also as an overweight person, knowing you were as well, I have to say - come on dude. Fat people know we are fat. We try and fail at multiple diets, some things help, a lot doesn't. If your girlfriend was interested in replicating your success, she would ASK for your help. It would be remarkably cruel for you to now tell your partner, who is the same person she was a \"few months ago\" when you started dating that she should lose weight. And you know that, but you can't help yourself because now you see yourself in a new way and think she would just be better too, and that's not how life works. \n\nThe only thing you can do is if SHE raises something about wanting to lose weight, you could then offer your help and advice. If she says \"the doctor said X, I really need to lose weight\" then you can say \"well you know my journey, and I'd be happy to go to the gym with you/meal prep/support\" but any unsolicited conversation about how you can help her is an AH move.", "Obviously YWBTA .\n\nIf you don't like her as she is you're under no duress to stay with her.", "You mentioned the word look before feel which leads me to believe that this is simply a physical attraction thing?\nAm I right?\n\nBut yes YWBTA, if she asks you then you are good. But any conversation you start makes you definitely TA", "You would probably push her away from you if you push this too hard.  You first need to find out how she feels about her weight.  No one wants to be overweight, but for many this is a lifelong pursuit to lose weight and many just don't know how to attack it.   Let her come to the  conclusion and then you can offer suggestions but it's a tricky conversation to have.", "YTA she looked like that when you started dating and now you want to change her", "YWBTA. The only way you lost that much weight is if you were taking Ozempic or a doctor prescribed weightless drug. OR it was water weight. Alot of obese people have hard time losing weight for various reasons but one is that the fat holds too much insulin (why they are sometimes diabetic) {my Doctor told me that btw}\n\nBefore you tell her anything, remind yourself how you would feel if someone told YOU what YOU needed to do with your health. You aren't her doctor, don't know her diagnosis etc. You sound like a shallow AH\n\n>I (23M) have been dating this woman (27F) for a few months.

From the start, both of you were overweight, and you knew exactly that she was overweight as well. Within the 4 months, you lose over 60 lbs which is incredibly fast (and imo unmaintainable once you go off your current diet) and your opinion of your gf changes because you changed. Your gf is still the same person. Your weight loss and ego changed you. You now say that if your gf doesn\u2019t try to lose the weight, you\u2019ll consider breaking up with her? I\u2019m sure there were other reasons why you liked her besides her weight/size. \n\nI would be upset if I had a SO tell me that I was too overweight for them and that I either had to lose weight to keep them or they\u2019ll leave and I stay the same. \n\nI think you should decide whether or not you want to stay with her asap to not waste her time. \n\nIf you choose to stay with her, you can see what activities she\u2019s interested in that you may be as well and plan dates around that ex. walk/talk in the park, hiking/sightseeing, kayaking/swimming, visiting a museum, etc with a picnic/lunch with healthy foods and a special treat you both enjoy. These are fun ways for ppl to be active as well as enjoy each others company (for most ppl \u2026I think). \n\nDo NOT sit her down and tell her she should go to the gym with you and start dieting.", "YWBTA. She knows she's overweight. She doesn't need you to tell her. You'll just be letting her know that you don't love her unconditionally.", "YTA. Unless you are her doctor (which would be unethical, since you are dating), you have no business telling someone to lose weight.", "YTA.

You made a rather drastic change to your lifestyle and want to be healthier. But now you want that in other aspects of your life, including your partner. I'd just make sure you are being honest with your intentions here. I don't really buy into the \"big is beautiful\" crap. Yah, it's healthy to have a lil bit of chonk, but excess weight is unattractive and detrimental to health. And there are a LOT of factors that go into weight gain and it can be extremely difficult, mentally and physically, for people to lose that weight.\n\nWhy do you want her to lose weight, really? And does she WANT to? Is she even capable of it?\n\nMaybe it's just because you're a lot physically healthier now, and you want a physically healthier partner that's more physically attractive.\n\nMaybe you are healthier and want her to be healthy too because there are more benefits to health if you are in a healthy weight range.\n\nMaybe you are just not attracted to her anymore or think you can do better. Maybe you want this for you. \n\nWhatever the intentions, if you need her to lose weight to be happy, approach the conversation humbly and cautiously, without any kind of judgement. You were just obese yourself, after all. If it's because you aren't attracted to her anymore, tell her that. Be honest. It's better than lying and breaking up later down the road. If it's because you want to do more healthy activities and you want her to be a part of that, tell her that. Be honest. Tell her you want a long and happy life with her and you want to help her get her weight down.\n\nBut if she doesn't want to lose weight, will you still be happy with her? Or will you resent her for it? Better to just end it then, but DO NOT degrade her or make her feel like she's at fault here.

B.S. I\u2019ve only seen that on my 600 lb life.", "YTA. \n\nFirst of all, if she wants your help she will ask for it. There is nothing more frustrating than unsolicited commentary. \n\nSecondly, you claim you only care about her health but what you have done is far from healthy. By your own account you lost 60lb in four months, eating mostly lean meat and veggies. Let\u2019s crunch some numbers. A recommended healthy weight loss target is a maximum of 1-2lb per week. There\u2019s about 17-18 weeks in four months, meaning a healthy rate of weight loss would have been around 20-30lb, 40 at the absolute maximum. So you\u2019ve doubled the rate vs what is considered healthy. You did so through a highly restrictive diet, which has been shown over and over to be unsustainable for the majority of people. Those who lose weight rapidly through highly restricted eating habits and very low calorie diets are very likely to gain it back and more besides. Slow adjustments to diet and lifestyle are far more sustainable in the long term. \n\nMaybe what you did works for you. Maybe you\u2019ll be an outlier and keep the weight off. But four months of personal journey does NOT qualify you to be giving weight loss advice to anyone else. \n\nWhether your girlfriend continues to make weight loss progress slowly and steadily, or decides to can the whole thing altogether, is none of your business.

YWBTA she only needs to lose weight if she wants to.", "YWBTA - I think most people here have covered why you are the AH. But I would like to also point out the women and men have very different hormones and as a result it will always be easier for you to loose weight with just some basic exercise and healthy eating. For her it may well end up being a struggle that will never end and will destroy her confidence trying to obtain standards you wish should could reach.", "YWBTA.  You say that she recognises that she is overweight, but is she complaining about it?  Has she raised the issue and said that she really wants to lose weight?  Because if she hasn\u2019t then you would be an asshole. \n\nYou say that she is a great person and that you have similar interests, and yet that isn\u2019t good enough for you?  She was good enough for you before you lost weight, but now not so much.  So it looks a lot like you don\u2019t want her to lose weight for the benefit of her health, but because you now feel embarrassed or uncomfortable being seen with her and don\u2019t find her as attractive anymore.\n\nYou are 23 years old, but in a decade or two you may realise that being with \u201ca great person who has similar interests with you and who you really like and get along well with\u201d, is an absolute blessing.

None of those things are bad, but would you like someone to make a relationship contingent on you fixing those things?

She knows full well how much she weighs, and that you weigh less, and that you go to the gym and eat differently than she does. If she wanted to do those things with you, she would. Telling her to do those things with you is not going to make her want to do them. \n\nIf her size is now a dealbreaker for you because you\u2019re a different size than when you met, just break up with her so she can date someone who likes her body.

This will be beyond humiliating and hurtful for her and can create body image issues. I understand wanting her to have a healthy lifestyle but this is not the approach to take.  I think you can certainly invite her to do active things like going for a walk or hike as opposed to inviting her to pizza parties. Or you can invite her over for dinner and cook something healthy and delicious for you both like salmon and a salad.  You can encourage a healthy lifestyle by inviting her to do healthy and fun things but you cannot patrol what she is eating/doing and you cannot shame her for her choices.", "YWBTA.\n\nI'm glad you lost weight in the way you wanted to.

Each person has to decide for themselves if they want change, and if they want help with it.", "YWBTA. \n\nYou think she doesn't know she's overweight? You think she's unaware that if she made some changes, she might be able to lose weight? If she wants your \"push and motivation\", she'll ask for it.", "Absolutely.  YWBTA    You can\u2019t change other people.  She has to be the one to make the decision to lose weight.\n\nYour words will be hurtful and will more than likely cause emotional eating.

You obviously found something worthwhile about your gf when you started dating her. Remember that and forget about whatever her number on the scale is.

Let her be.  Offer her to come with you to the gym or a hike, but don't force it.

YWBTA if you pushed her to do something she didn\u2019t wanna do.", "NAH\n\nA part of being in a relationship is attraction. Another part of a relationship is communication. If you feel you are losing attraction to your partner, you are allowed to discuss it RESPECTFULLY and honestly. If you bring it up and she has no plans to lose weight or doesn\u2019t feel her weight is an issue, be respectful of her answer. Don\u2019t try to convince her to change her mind or do something she doesn\u2019t want to do. That leaves you with the option to date her and deal with it or leave. She doesn\u2019t have to change for you. But part of being an adult in a relationship is communication and being able to have conversations about all parts of that relationship.", "You\u2019re already an asshole for even thinking this may be a good idea", "I'm going with YWBTAH\n\nThe title says, \"ask her to lose weight,\" but the body of the text says, \"invite and encourage.\"  The way you talk about her tells me that you care about her image and not her health or lifestyle. \n\nYou can absolutely invite someone to join you on your path to health. Eat well together, be more active, etc. But with that comes the opportunity to come off as shallow, so be careful. If your desire for her to maintain her health is genuine, great. Cholesterol, blood sugar, bone health, pain levels... they're all decent reasons to eat healthy and be more active. Plus, at a certain point, body type could prevent someone from living a certain lifestyle. If you want to hike and she can't, will you two still have enough other things in common? \n\nThink over your reasons for wanting her to lose weight and be honest with yourself, and with her. Does she have to lose weight just because you did? If she's happy and a good person, Does her physical appearance matter? But if her doctor has said she needs to watch her cholesterol or something, you can help her with that. \n\nWeight and nutrition are important, but you can still care for someone even if they aren't perfect. You can help and guide, but don't make it into a chore, or judgment, or an obsession.", "NTA NTA NTA!\n\nSome people need more motivation, and she's lucky if you feel capable and in the position to do so. Weight gain is important to avoid and if you can make this a bonding experience then all the best for the relationship! \n\nIf it's not conditional for you to love her, which I don't believe it is, it sounds great to me. If it's a deal breaker for the relationship, that's still ok. \n\nI like that you're taking initiative and you truly care about this woman. I'm rooting for you.", "Encouraging people to be healthy and want them to work out doesn't make YTA.\n\nDating someone exclusively and then wanting them to change makes YTA. \n\nLike someone else said, that's a fantastic way to become single.", "Could be an unpopular opinion but NTA. If my partner was overweight I would raise the topic too. Atleast so that they know that being overweight can carry health issues. I am married since 5 years both me and my husband are skinny, I work out everyday and I push my husband every single day to workout as well. I prepare his bowl of fruits and nuts and his vitamins if ever he forgets. I want him to be healthy and fit and there is nothing wrong in asking the people you love to make a beneficial change", "YTA: What you are saying is that you want your partner to fit your image now that you achieved your goal. It\u2019s great you made that choice but if you do talk to your partner about to, it will be like telling her that she isn\u2019t pretty enough for you anymore.", "It's like when someone who used to smoke 3 packs a day quits and starts wrinkling their nose at smokers and launches into a lecture about how unhealthy and disgusting it is every chance they get \ud83d\ude44", "This is the clincher for me on YWBTA. She didn\u2019t ask for help. I\u2019m happy you feel good about your weight loss OP but that\u2019s you.", "Great suggestions! Also nobody should embark upon a major weight loss program without seeing a doctor first.", "He\u2019s not her fitness coach though, and she didn\u2019t ask him anything. It would be different if she was the one willingly starting this conversation and asking him for help.", "Unsolicited advice is generally not welcome. We don\u2019t even know how overweight she is, or if that\u2019s due to medical reasons. What\u2019s for sure, a 23yo male is not in a position to give constructive advice to a 27yo female, considering hormones and metabolism play a huge role in weight loss and he\u2019s not a medical professional.", "This is such an immature outlook.. really. Granted - we are missing some context here, but it is not unreasonable or unfathomable to want your partner to do better for themselves. \nThe way I see it, \nIf he was a shallow AH like ya'll are pegging him for - he's perfectly capable of dumping her and move on to his shallow choice, but that's not what's going on here. He's asking how to help essentially, that makes him an asshole? \n\nIf she flat out refused, and it was an issue pushed - yes. Asshole.\n\nBut - \n\nop has put in legwork to take better care of himself, now it's kinda naive to think your other half is just gonna hop on whatever bandwagon your on all willy nilly like - But seeing the health benefits of said legwork he sees in himself - you think it is wrong to want that for someone you love & want to invest your life in? \n\nI had a very overweight cousin who had this same issue. He picked up running & lifting, shed the lifelong weight & did great. \nAlso dating his first and only girlfriend (now fiance) who did not have any interest in his new hobbies - but he was terrified if they married, at her rate - she would not live to see their future. It wasn't a vain concept. When you care and love for someone, you want the best for them - period. You can't force it on them by any means. But you can ask\n And that does not make you an asshole.", "100%", "This. I lost 7 stones (I'm English so I don't know what that is in pounds) through grief and anxiety when my partner died during the pandemic. I was eating only once a day and walking 5 miles. 7 stones in 7 months. As soon as my appetite returned so did the weight. I'm now losing it at a much healthier pace to make sure it stays off. But yeah. This guy is very much an asshole.", "It doesnt depend on how big they are - the bigger the person, the more weight they lose especially in the beginning", "You are 0% qualified to give anyone advice about weight loss.", "So in four months you haven't had fruits, dairy, grains, or nuts? How many vitamins and other nutrients are you missing? How is your digestive system still functioning? It's great that you have improved your cardiovascular health, but it sounds like you had to cut out a lot of vital nutrients to lose that weight, and trying to convince someone else to do that would be wrong.\n\nBut I'm not a nutritionist so if anyone can correct me, go ahead.", "For this alone, she needs to break up with you. You are wasting her time, she can find someone who hasn't already decided he gets to decide for her what her life will be like.", "Not just that, he\u2019s wrongly assuming weight loss works in the same way for a 23yo male and a 27yo female. Spoiler, it doesn\u2019t, so he\u2019s not in a position to give her constructive advice, and he\u2019s likely to make things worse for her if she\u2019s actually trying to lose weight.", "He has lost weight himself, so he can give her at least some advice. If that doesnt work, then he could tell her to start going to the gym, eating healthier, etc. Also, just because he isn't a medical professional, doesn't mean he cant give advice. I can give you relationship advice without being a relationship-ist (idk where I was going with that one tbh).", "Exactly, it needs to be sustainable above all else \n\nBtw, 7 stones is 98 pounds for anyone wondering", "Exactly, if he was morbidly obese and super tall, maybe 60 pounds in 3 months wouldn't be extravagant, but if that were the case, he'd still be overweight.", "Or he\u2019s on the crystal", "It feels like this post could turn into an MLM pitch real quick\n  \n\nYou won't believe how quick, easy, and delicious these shakes are!", "He\u2019s not female, and he\u2019s younger, so what works for him may not work for her at all. Weight loss is a lot more complicated than what people think. Also, we don\u2019t even know her current BMI, or medical conditions she might have and which could make her situation completely different.\n\nAt the end of the day, if she wanted advice from him, she would ask directly, especially if he\u2019s lost a lot of weight since they first met. He shouldn\u2019t be the one initiating this conversation as it\u2019s very unlikely to be what she wants if she hasn\u2019t brought up that topic herself.", "are you the GF's doctor? or a doctor in general?", "[deleted]", "If you can find me case studies or doctors that can corroborate your apparent claim that obesity will lead to a longer life span, I will send you $100 \ud83e\udd23", "Are you like 4'11? 100 lbs is already a pretty low weight...", "You should never tell her what to lose weight.  If she asks you for help give it.
