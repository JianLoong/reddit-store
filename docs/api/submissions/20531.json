It\u2019s way easier to explain this concept NOW than when he gets in trouble at school for harassing a girl who has a bra strap showing. He should be seeing this as an opportunity to point out how his son needs to be responsible and respectful- and explaining that he is sexualizing his step mother is a great place to start!!! \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your seriously unfortunate husband problem.

As far as the \"stop sexualising me\" quote, she was telling her husband that the way she dresses is not about sex.

Otherwise they lose vigour.", "Hopefully, you're not responsible for kids. The only way to break this sort of toxic thinking is to actually teach kids differently.  Hormones or not boys are capable of controlling themselves. Girls/women and their clothes are not responsible for boys' feelings.

Dad should work with him on addressing his issues and not Step-Mom's clothes.", "On that note, we should also release caged lions at the zoo to train them not to eat people. Boys are hardly able to control themselves, even with recent times' the decline in \\[their \"toxic\" hormone\\] testosterone. You may as well feed him soy, because with those hormone levels, he's definitely feeling it.\n\nOr you could get him to lower his gaze, but at that point the woman might as well wear proper clothes.

And in both situations I'm expected to have self restraint and be a decent human being.\nIt may interest you to know also that there isn't a magical single level of hormone intensity, it varies wildly from person to person even for cis people.\nLots of women do actually have an excess of testosterone, it's why Olympic athletes are tested and sometimes forced to take blockers...", "you are disgustingly misogynistic"]}
