They have despised each other since and would be cold to/or about each other, though he never explained the details of why they broke up and has been extremely hurt by this. \n\nA couple of days back, a number was calling me several times in the middle of the night and i answered. It was his ex girlfriend, she was crying and mumbling. She was going on about her mother and it was all incoherent. She was clearly inebriated and i calmed her down, she was asking me if she could stay in the guest bedroom for the rest of the night and i told her that she can stay however long she saw fit. Me and my wife included her into breakfast the next morning even though she felt embarrassed and my son joined us, but was clearly flabbergasted by seeing her and was about to leave, though i encouraged him to sit with us. It was quite awkward to say the least, though it is evident they clearly still like each other as i have seen her at our house. She cut her stay short as she said her parents would be worried and it was better if she started heading home. My son offered to drive her home, she just said \u201dno, thank you\u201d and left. \n\nAs soon as she left, he got upset at both of us and was wondering \u201cwhy she was here for breakfast?\u201d and he told us that we were immensely invasive of a space in his life that is fragile and that i don\u2019t respect his boundaries by letting her stay without his knowledge.

And you shouldn\u2019t be offering to let her stay indefinitely! I get giving her a safe place for that night, but offering to let her stay as long as she needs without even talking to your son first shows no regard at all for his feelings, or comfort in his own home.\n\nDid you date anybody before your wife? Ever had an ex? How can you not get where he\u2019s coming from here? \n\nI realize that your intentions in helping her were good, but you went about this all wrong and in a way that was a betrayal to your son.

Wow.\n\nAs for the rest, you are the hero, but I'm concerned how she got to your house?  If she was inebriated, you should have transported her.  Also, you should have contacted her parents to let them know their daughter was safe.  You can make it anonymous by dialing \\*67 before their number, if she didn't want them to know where she was for some reason.  Or use her phone, since she's there.", "YTA\n\nYou could have (at the very least) gave him a heads up. That's a super awkward position to be in when no one gives you a clue it's gonna happen. Whether they like each other still or not, you can't be blindsiding your kid like that. Just like you, he deserves to feel comfortable in his own home.\n\nYou for sure did the right thing in regard to letting her stay.

Leave him a note.", "YTA Why would you not take 60 seconds to at the very least, send him a text or pop in his room.", "For not telling him? Yea, you sure are.

Generally though, most parents have the common courtesy of checking with their child first to make sure they wouldn't be uncomfortable before offering your home for them to stay.\n\nHowever,  the LEAST you could have done is forewarned him, even if you weren't going to give him a say.  To blindside him like that first thing in the morning is very much an AH move.  You made him uncomfortable in his own house, that is a lousy thing to do.", "YTA.  \n\nFrankly, it sounds like your motivation for taking her in was wanting the kids back together, not her well-being.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t confirm it was safe for her to go home, or what prompted her excessive drinking.  Or how an 18-year-old had access to large amounts of liquor in the first place.\n\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you address the cause of the excessive drinking?  She\u2019s 18; how is she getting large amounts of alcohol?  How frequently is she drinking and why?  \n\nDid you ask her for details about her issues with her mother once she was sober?  \n\nIf you cared for her well-being you would have done more than just allowed an intoxicated 18 year old to stay over: you would have tried to address the problem and assess whether it was safe for her to return home or if intervention was appropriate.  \n\n\nAlso, definitely the AH for not telling your son and especially for forcing (\u201cencouraging \u201c) him to be in a situation that clearly made him uncomfortable.\n\n\nI would like to hear your son\u2019s version of the story.  \n\nI hope that girl is okay.

She chose to burn that bridge by breaking up with him.

Your son and his ex broke up. That\u2019s it. They didn\u2019t give you grandkids or anything like that so you shouldn\u2019t be having any type of relationship with her. The fact she called you is a bit troubling. She doesn\u2019t think your son is worth her time but his parents are for some reason.

I was the mom all the kids felt comfortable talking to. I never judged them and only gave them advice if they asked. I picked up more than one kid from a party because they were too drunk to drive or in a situation they needed to get out of. No questions, no judgement. I was just glad they would get help, if not from me, from someone. Luckily their parents were mostly the same, one saved my kid because they didn't want to call me LOL.\n\nIt sounds like you are this person to the ex-girlfriend. It's REALLY not easy. I went through this twice. Something happened with a kid and their dad and they called me bawling.

I did tell her beforehand and she wasn't thrilled, but when the visitor left, she spiraled. Next time I knew to tell her and give her the option of staying in her room or leaving before they came out for breakfast or otherwise helping my kid too. It's a tough balance.\n\nYTA because you didn't warn your son. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that you can't help a kid in need because it will upset your child because I know you probably aren't able to do that. I could never walk away from a teen in trouble. They trust so few people and when they are willing to talk, you better be ready to listen because who knows when they will again.  being a teen or young adult is SO hard, between the emotions, drama, hormones, it's all just a shitshow. I think you owe your son an apology for not warning him. You should probably also apologize to her for putting her in that awkward situation by not telling him she was there.\n\nI hope everything is okay with the young lady. She's lucky to have someone she trusts to call when she needs help.", "YTA\n\nAt the very least you should have warned your son.

I wouldn't abandon a drunk teenager that is reaching out for a place to stay in the middle of the night - you did the right thing there. Ideally, you would have gave your son a heads up before he arrived at the breakfast table but that seems like a minor error after a chaotic evening rather than an asshole move. I would still give your son an apology because that just seems appropriate in the circumstances. He also showed maturity by still offering her a lift home despite the awkwardness. I hope she is OK though and it was just alcohol induced drama and not something more serious.", "From the looks of other comments, I\u2019m gonna get hate for this, but I\u2019m going to say NTA asshole ONLY because it happened in the middle of the night.\n\nI\u2019m assuming the son was asleep. There was no way to warn him without waking him up, and he probably still would have been upset about it if you had. Whatever his ex has going on, I\u2019m glad you helped her and I hope he was more understanding of the situation after learning the specifics of how it happened.\n\nIf something like this had happened in the middle of the day when everyone was awake or it was something you had planned ahead of time to try to \u201cParent Trap\u201d then back together, it\u2019d be a different situation for me.

Once you finish alienating your son and disregarding his feelings, it\u2019ll be good that you have a replacement child lined up and ready to go. \n\nI\u2019m guessing that you\u2019d punish your son for doing something thoughtless and hurtful towards you or your wife. So what do you think your punishment should be? Just because you\u2019re an adult doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean you get to avoid the consequences of your actions. \n\nAnd if your son does something rude, or thoughtless, or uncaring in the future, how are you going to react, considering that you are teaching him that this is acceptable behavior? \n\nNever forget: you only saw what this girl and your son showed you. And you saw what you wanted to see. The fact your son doesn\u2019t feel he can trust you with the reason for the breakup should tell you something. If it turned out this girl has a substance abuse problem, and her personality changed drastically when she\u2019s under the influence, what then? What if you found out she was manipulative? Cruel? Or just a regular bully to others. Would you accept the truth, or defend her? \n\nYTA", "Your kid needs to come first. Not his ex. You could have told him by text or call or email or going to his room, which is presumably in the same house and not blocked off by a sinkhole. Honestly. \n\nLet them figure their own shit out. If anything you\u2019ve set them way back. YTA", "A parent should never choose anyone over their child unless their child is harming someone. \n\nYTA", "YTA", "YTA. Why would you do that? He was completely right.", "YTA. Not for helping the girlfriend in a moment of crisis but for not even attempting to warn your son she was there. At the very least, you could have told him before he walked into the kitchen.", "Mostly NTA fort helping a clearly intoxicated young person get to a safe place to sober up. \nKinda YTA for not giving him a heads up bc he's still a kid (legally an adult) and that can take a toll on his mental and change his perception of his parents from loving and supportive to back stabbing and betraying. \n\nEither way it's a shitty situation for sure but getting her to a safe place takes priority imo as a father.", "YTA.  He\u2019s your son, she\u2019s a girl who broke up with him for whatever reason.  I can see having her for the night for safety purposes.  But not informing your son was asinine.  On top of that you offered to allow her to stay as long as she wanted.  WTH is wrong with you?  Everything about this screams WRONG", "I am amazed at your child\u2019s ability to express his emotions so coherently! Everything he said sounds extremely reasonable and reflected\u2026 he\u2019s a teenager and that\u2019s the response you got - you should be grateful! \n\nObviously YTA", "You did what was right the night before.  You probably should have warned him before breakfast.  I refuse to call you an A though.", "Wow.. YTA to the 9th. level. I don't even wanna say anymore so I don't get banned.", "NTA. It sounded like a potential situation. You didn\u2019t invite to Christmas.", "soft YTA. \n\nI\u2019m glad this girl felt that you were enough of a trusted adult to ring in a time of crisis for help, and that you\u2019re mature enough to still take her in and help regardless of the situation. \n\nBut you should\u2019ve given your son a quick message or heads up of the situation so it wasn\u2019t awkward in the morning and he could choose to avoid her.", "YTA.\n\nThis is such a betrayal to your son. You haven't given us enough information to suggest she actually did need a place to stay (and had nowhere else to stay). I don't care how close you were with her while she was with your son. They are no longer together, you should do right by your son and cut her off.", "YTA, but not because you let your son\u00b4s ex inside the house (from your story, it seems it was a safety measure), but because you didn\u00b4t give your son a heads-up, specially when you don\u00b4t know what happened between then and why the relationship ended, in what I assume aren\u00b4t the best of terms.", "YTA. You are prioritizing this girl over your kid. You have no idea what happened between them and you\u2019re not showing him respect as an adult.", "YTA.\n\nI get giving the girl a place to safely crash for the night. But a heads up to your son is the least you could do. \n\nRight now you come across as meddling. If she came over after the break up, then that was your son's business. It may have been for a final talk, or whatever. It may have been to try and hang out as friends. You don't know.\n\nBut here's what really makes you the AH. You're supposed to be a safe place for your children, first and foremost. Right now he needs a safe place to heal his heart, and figure things out. You aren't that for him, and your home isn't that for him.", "Is it me, or asking if he's the asshole makes him more of an asshole?  \nYou should not keep a relationship with your sons ex, regardless of how much you adore her, second if you're letting her stay, the least you could do is tell your son, you didnt know how they felt for each other since you didnt know the full details of the breakup.", "YTA for a number of reasons.\n\nFirstly, you're still in contact with her. She broke your child's heart. Your lack of loyalty to your son is astounding. The fact that she felt comfortable enough to contact you is weird.\n\nSecondly, when she called, you made a decision to bring someone who hurt your son into his home, his safe space. You never once spoke to him to ask if he minded her coming over, nor did you warn him that she would be there. You took away his consent and comfort in his own home.\n\nIf the ex girlfriend was distressed and needed a place to stay that evening and you felt compelled to help her, you could've booked her into a hotel to give her a place to stay.\n\nPlease have some respect and loyalty to your son and tell her to back off.", "YTA\u2026 you should have poked your head into his room and warned him so he could have pretended to sleep in or something to avoid her. You\u2019re not an AH for helping her out in a time of need though.", "YTA for not informing your son. He will survive but it would have cost you nothing to give him a heads up. It\u2019s just basic courtesy.", "Coming soon: Update. My son left and wouldn\u2019t tell me where he is going. What did I do wrong?", "YTA.", "NAH. A teen called a trusted adult for help. You helped. Maybe you should've given him a heads up but in no way does this seem intentional. But the are some deeply hurt there that you need you talk to your son and", "YTA. My parents did this same thing to me. My ex was abusive. There was a reason we broke up. I shouldn't have needed to spill my trauma in order to get them to stop inviting him to stuff.", "YTA, all you had to do was text your son that \"[ex gf] came over last night for some personal reason, and she's here for breakfast, just a heads up\" before he came out of his room. Let him get in the right headspace. Home is his stable safe place, and while it's great that you want to offer that stability to the ex gf, your son's safety and stability has to come first. You didn't have to turn her away, but you DID need to inform him. Talk to him about how to navigate things if you must, but remember your son is the priority for you.", "I can\u2019t say if YTA\u2026. But the way people are today, I think you are descent people.", "YTA. How would ypu like it if your son invited over the last dude your wife smashed before she married you? It's all good huh? Just sit down and eat pancakes? That is your son's ex. She doesn't belong anywhere around him unless HE invites her.", "Yta", "YTA, I understand she needed help but you should have respected your sons boundaries. Also you don\u2019t know the whole story and know if she abused him or hurt him in anyway.", "Yta... maybe she cheated and thats why they broke up?\nMaybe she was the problem and he chose to go on with his life. This is u bringing  her back into the mix bc u and your wife liked her not considering the hurt or pain he may have been in.... its wrong.", "YTA", "YTA. He should have been made aware she was in his home. It should be his safe space.", "YTA. your house should be a safe place for you kids. A simple conversation with him before he was surprised was the least you could have done.\n\nHer being si drunk, she can't talk or think clearly is probably one of  the many things your kid has decided not to  discuss with you.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to do the right thing in terms of an inebriated upset vulnerable teen ... your mistake was not telling him before breakfast but that's not such a big deal, you can just apologize.\n\nHe could have opted not to join for breakfast if he really didn't want to see her. \n\nBut don't worry about it too hard.", "NAH. I would have done the same thing if a friend of my daughter\u2019s needed help. I would not be happy if I was your son.", "Nta for letting her stay that was very kind of you as she was obviously in some state! BUT NTA for not giving your son the heads up that\u2019s quite a thing to be blindsided by!!! Put yourself in his position/mental space\u2026\u2026.apologise to your son and take him out for breakfast if there\u2019s a next time", "NTA for helping her out when she needed it. Clearly she was a mess and felt safe enough to call you.\n\nHowever\u2026YTA for not warning your son. You could have grabbed him as soon as he woke up to let him know the situation.", "Soft YTA \n\nAll you had to do was warn him that the girl that broke his heart would be in his home. You\u2019re not TA for helping her and being a safe place for her, but you should have warned him after allowing her to stay. You also shouldn\u2019t have made him sit with her..she broke his damn heart! Allow him to have boundaries!", "My mother did this to me with my ex. While I understand this is a tough situation, and my ex was in a tough situation as well, to an 18 year old (I was the same age at the time) living with my ex put a big stain on my relationship with my mom. It made me feel like he was more important to her than I was. Especially cause I was made to feel like an AH for not wanting him there. After he left he ended up stalking me, so the close proximity clearly wasn\u2019t healthy for him. Not that that\u2019s what would come of this situation but I would hope that OP and the girlfriend would discuss if there were more options and it\u2019s shitty to offer your home to someone without consulting everyone who lives there, including the son.", "Awesome question", "Agree. He should have woken his son as soon as he got the call. \"Hey, friend is very upset and sounds drunk. We're going to let her sleep here because we're worried about her safety but she'll leave in the morning.\" \n\nOP shouldn't be playing matchmaker for sure.", "Perfectly said", "Yes, I have seen her at our house on many occasions, that is why I am perplexed.", "Further:  she chose her son's ex girlfriend over her son.", "Precisely this.", "FYI many places around the world, eg Europe allow alcohol sales starting at 16 (beer, wine) everything at 18", "She may be 18, but she's still a teenager. A teenager who called a trusted adult for help when they needed it. \n\nI do think that OP should have warned the son what was going on. Especially as he doesn't know the details of what happened with the relationship. \n\nI don't think this is a set of parents who is overly invested in the kid's relationship. I think it's an adult who did their best to help a vulnerable teenager in what was a potential emergency. Do I think they handled it badly and fumbled the situation? I definitely do! I don't think it's quite 'maintaining a relationship' with the ex though.. OP didn't even recognize the number when the ex called. He didn't reach out or go looking for her. He extended a helping hand ( TEMPORARILY) to a distressed teenager who called for help.", "Disagree 100% with your first assertion. They are adults and can have a relationship with whomever they want, even a child's ex. \n\nBut for part two, YTA.  They should have warned the son that she was coming over and staying the night so he could act accordingly and avoid her.", "Oh, she doesn\u2019t have a bad bone in her.", "Yes, I caught that too. Offering a ride despite being annoyed by it all shows empathy. And I agree that OP should apologize to his son, but also explain he would want the ex\u2019s family to offer the same care is the son needed it. Their physical safety comes first, but understanding the awareness is important too.", "A text message warning the son, catching him before he reached the kitchen, a note on the door... Nope, no way to communicate this info without waking him up.", "He\u2019s not an AH for helping her out he\u2019s an AH for not warning the son then forcing him to be around her when he tried to skip out.", "That makes sense, but surprises in the early morning are never pleasant. Should've stopped him before he left his room in the morning...or even texted (assuming he's a stereotypical teen who checks his phone often).", "She probably cheated on Halloween but wants him to forgive her. YTA. Your son needs a safe space & your home is no longer it, you could have texted him a heads up.", "Outside your house? Or youve seen her in your house? Like they still hang out?", "Yeah, imo the issue here isn't that OP still has a relationship with the ex, the issue here is that he didn't tell his son.", "I disagree. Letting her crash in a potentially dangerous situation? Fine. No issues there. But this isn't just an oopsies about not warning him. Aside from that:\n\n\\- They actively encouraged a breakfast with her.  Pretty clearly intent on having them interact. Not just sheltering and feeding her for safety reasons.\n\n\\- \"it was evident they still clearly like each other.\" In the context of her safety, why the fuck is this relevant?\n\n\\-  \"She cut her stay.\" Huh? This wasn't a planned vacation. She spontaneously called at night. They kept her safe for the night and fed her in the morning. She was now sober. The situation was successfully dealt with. Why would he be under the impression that she'd need to stay longer?\n\nThere is very obviously more to this than, \"we prioritized her immediate safety and misjudged how he'd feel about seeing her sitting in the kitchen.\" They very clearly want her presence around the house and, specifically, their son. I'd bet they're hoping they get back together. It is a major violation of boundaries and a complete disregard for his feelings.", ">A teenager who called a trusted adult for help when they needed it.\n\nI get what you're saying, but the adult is betraying their own child's trust and potentially putting them in danger, or at the very least massive discomfort.\n\nTalk to the girl and work out a solution or find her another place to sleep (a motel?).  Don't risk your own son, especially without even letting him know.", "I think it was right for OP to go and help her. Even letting her spend the night (maaaaaaybe), but he definitely should have warned his son and not encouraged him to sit and eat when both were clearly uncomfortable. Best case scenario he should have taken ex-gf home or given her a ride home before breakfast", "They can, it is still weird. I don't understand why they would want to retain a relationship with someone who they likely have very little in common with and who has clearly distressed their son. It would be different were it an ex-wife or the mother of their grandchildren but it isn't. It's an ex from a childhood relationship who has caused trauma to their child.\n\nThese are the kind of things that lead to estrangement and parents saying \"why won't my kids talk to me\"", "You should edit your post and let everyone here know you're psychic.\n\nIt brings back memories.  My parents thought my first GF was an angel too, despite me telling them that she really was not.  She was very sweet and innocent looking, and she knew how to play it up like a pro.\n\nIt lasted right up to the point where she stole their car.", "I don\u2019t know how you could be certain of that - but also, even if it\u2019s true it\u2019s irrelevant. A breakup can be quite painful even when (perhaps especially when) it\u2019s due to something other than one person just being \u201cbad.\u201d She could be a great person and it\u2019s still very reasonable for your son to not want to be ambushed with her presence at breakfast!", "Said every person ever about serial killers, abusers, and toxic people in general", "This is such a tone deaf and brain dead response.", "Everyone says the EXACT same thing about my ex! \n\nWell,.everyone except people who have dated him but that's mainly because, at this point in his life, he has 3 restraining orders from 3 different woman and countless charges for breaking said restraining orders and then all the battery charges from over the years.  \n\nBut,.everyone who hasn't dated him will tell you that he is the kindest person they have ever met.", "You don't know that. You saw a person who was trying to make a positive impression on the parents of her partner. Most abusers are well regarded by those other than their victims \n\nHowever, I'm not saying that she is an abuser, but rather pointing out that you have no idea about the situation which has seriously affected your son, but have still chosen to retain this relationship in a position of ignorance and then on top of that, ambushed him with this person in his safe space. It's completely unacceptable and I think you already knew you were the asshole before posting this. Your son actually seems to have handled it incredibly well, I would have been far worse.", "YTA. You can\u2019t possibly know that with 100% certainty.", "I have met a lot of \u201csweet girls\u201d that are actually toxic AF when the right ppl aren\u2019t looking.", "My mom says the same about my ex\u2026.who backed me into the corner in our kitchen with his hand on my throat. Who, on more than one occasion, twisted my arm behind my back to stop me from walking away from him. Who coerced me into sex multiple times when I wasn\u2019t interested. Who told me there\u2019s nothing about me to appreciate aside from my physical attractiveness. Who repeatedly threatened harm to myself and/or himself if I ever tried to leave him.\n\nMy mom still talks to him and wishes him happy birthdays and merry Christmases and she\u2019s so proud of his military service. She still wants me to be with him because \u201che\u2019s such a good guy\u201d.", "No one is perfect. Don't put people up on pedestals, especially at the expense of your own child! This is so disturbing.", "People said that about Ted Bundy", "Does your son?  If not, then how do you think he felt when he saw her?  Hint:  it involves betrayal and ***your*** bones.", "YTA, you have no idea what happened truly.  You totally disregarded your son and his feelings.  What awesome parents you are to your son.", "WTF could you possibly know about it if she or your son didn't tell you?", "Every abuser in the world has someone who says this about them. Not saying that\u2019s the case here, but no one knows what happens in a relationship but the people in it.", "People say that about my ex all the time - he was abusive as hell to me. And he broke up with me in the end. You have no idea what goes on in the minutiae of other peoples relationships from the outside", "Assuming that he would see any of that in time. Given the circumstances, and the fact that OP and his wife may have been woken up themselves in the process and not had that much foresight at the time, I\u2019m still saying NTA. You\u2019re expecting people to behave perfectly on a lack of sleep and in an emergency situation where a teenage girl needed a safe place to stay. Things will be overlooked.", "I know what the question was about. I\u2019m saying NTA for not warning the son, which was the question asked, given the context of the situation.", "I would assume the other way around if she broke up with him.", "Well, in the house. I would bumped into her in the hallway, whilst my son was home.", "The problem is that it was the middle of the night, so he would have had to wake up son to give him a heads up so that he wouldn't be blindsided.\n\nI can see why they didn't turn her away.  I'm assuming she got in over her head and didn't feel like she could call her parents.  You don't turn away a vulnerable 18 year old when you get a call like that.\n\nOP doesn't say if she had Grandparents, Aunts or Uncles who she could have called instead.  I'm assuming not, if she resorted to her ex's home.", "I realise now my original comment doesn't make clear that's why I think they are the AH.\n\nIt's just my personal opinion that retaining the relationship is weird, it's not the reasoning for my judgement.", "Understandable, though she was the one who broke up with him after this Halloween party and he was distressed by this.", "It was obviously no longer an emergency that morning. You are telling me the parents had time to make fucking breakfast and have her sitting down there before son knew? That's just incredibly dumb.", "I don\u2019t know any teenager that wouldn\u2019t check their phone between waking up and breakfast. A text is all the kid would have needed, just a heads up.", "Texting exists.", "It can go either way. Pre-emptive breakup after cheating is a thing.", "If this is true, then why did she call you in the middle of the night asking for a place to stay, instead of calling him?", "Ahhh ok, cool! That makes sense.", "So he has his heart broken by this chick and you invite her into your home after that? Way to have your kids back! YTA I can't say it enough", "Yes, he was distressed and you just slapped him in the face.  You care more for her then your child.", "I don't quite understand why you think that makes this any better other than the fact that you are uterly delusional.\n\nThe likelihood is this girl cheated on your son at the party, dumped him for the new person, then regretted it and tried to make amends by turning up at your house.\n\nHonestly just try engaging even like 1% of your brain and you would realise you don't need to be on AITA to know YTA.", "> Oh, she doesn\u2019t have a bad bone in her\n\nAccording to /u/Infinite-Poetry-659, Jeffrey Dahmer also did not have a \u201cbad bone\u201d in his body because he would always spit out the bone fragments when chewing his meals", "So why does that make it okay for you to disregard your own son's comfort to cater to a girl that broke up with him? You make it very obvious that you really don't care about how he feels and I guarantee he'll remember this for a long time.", "Sounds like you like her more than you like your own son..", "That makes it worse.", "What do you mean \u201cthough\u201d? Is that supposed to make it better? That makes it worse, if anything.", "That makes it worse.  YTA", "Did you ever find out what the reason for her needing to stay overnight was?", "That makes this way worse", "I\u2019m sayin given the circumstances I understand that it may not have occurred to them to even send a text message. Even in the morning, yes.", "Do you know his son personally to know that he checks his text messages every morning?", "That is what I am confused by and why they put on the facade of despising each other.", "Do you know his son personally and know that he doesn\u2019t? I know plenty of teenagers, lmfao.", "So, to be clear - since breaking up, the (ex) gf has been in your house multiple times to visit your son, aside from this instance? Surely there are many reasons for that, that doesn't automatically mean that your son wouldn't still be surprised and upset at seeing her when he wasn't expecting it, and doesn't mean your son has got over his heartbreak either. You absolutely cannot magically detect if they both have feelings for each other either, it sounds like you want them to get back together, and partly did this/didn't warn son so you could have a surprise romantic reunion between them\n\nEdit - also, since they broke up, how often has she been at your house invited by your son? How long has she visited for each time. Does she just spent that time in his room, or for example having dinner with you all", "There's probably more at play here than what you're witnessing.\n\nIt'd be best to respect your son's wishes in this -- it's likely a sensitive situation. Let him handle it."]}
