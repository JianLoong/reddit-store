It was quite awkward to say the least, though it is evident they clearly still like each other as i have seen her at our house.

I get giving her a safe place for that night, but offering to let her stay as long as she needs without even talking to your son first shows no regard at all for his feelings, or comfort in his own home.\n\nDid you date anybody before your wife?

Wow.\n\nAs for the rest, you are the hero, but I'm concerned how she got to your house?  If she was inebriated, you should have transported her.  Also, you should have contacted her parents to let them know their daughter was safe.  You can make it anonymous by dialing \\*67 before their number, if she didn't want them to know where she was for some reason.  Or use her phone, since she's there.", "YTA\n\nYou could have (at the very least) gave him a heads up. That's a super awkward position to be in when no one gives you a clue it's gonna happen. Whether they like each other still or not, you can't be blindsiding your kid like that. Just like you, he deserves to feel comfortable in his own home.\n\nYou for sure did the right thing in regard to letting her stay.

Leave him a note.", "YTA Why would you not take 60 seconds to at the very least, send him a text or pop in his room.", "For not telling him? Yea, you sure are.

Generally though, most parents have the common courtesy of checking with their child first to make sure they wouldn't be uncomfortable before offering your home for them to stay.\n\nHowever,  the LEAST you could have done is forewarned him, even if you weren't going to give him a say.  To blindside him like that first thing in the morning is very much an AH move.  You made him uncomfortable in his own house, that is a lousy thing to do.", "YTA.  \n\nFrankly, it sounds like your motivation for taking her in was wanting the kids back together, not her well-being.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t confirm it was safe for her to go home, or what prompted her excessive drinking.  Or how an 18-year-old had access to large amounts of liquor in the first place.\n\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you address the cause of the excessive drinking?  She\u2019s 18; how is she getting large amounts of alcohol?  How frequently is she drinking and why?  \n\nDid you ask her for details about her issues with her mother once she was sober?  \n\nIf you cared for her well-being you would have done more than just allowed an intoxicated 18 year old to stay over: you would have tried to address the problem and assess whether it was safe for her to return home or if intervention was appropriate.  \n\n\nAlso, definitely the AH for not telling your son and especially for forcing (\u201cencouraging \u201c) him to be in a situation that clearly made him uncomfortable.\n\n\nI would like to hear your son\u2019s version of the story.  \n\nI hope that girl is okay.

She chose to burn that bridge by breaking up with him.

Your son and his ex broke up. That\u2019s it. They didn\u2019t give you grandkids or anything like that so you shouldn\u2019t be having any type of relationship with her. The fact she called you is a bit troubling. She doesn\u2019t think your son is worth her time but his parents are for some reason.

I was the mom all the kids felt comfortable talking to. I never judged them and only gave them advice if they asked. I picked up more than one kid from a party because they were too drunk to drive or in a situation they needed to get out of. No questions, no judgement. I was just glad they would get help, if not from me, from someone. Luckily their parents were mostly the same, one saved my kid because they didn't want to call me LOL.\n\nIt sounds like you are this person to the ex-girlfriend. It's REALLY not easy. I went through this twice. Something happened with a kid and their dad and they called me bawling.

I did tell her beforehand and she wasn't thrilled, but when the visitor left, she spiraled. Next time I knew to tell her and give her the option of staying in her room or leaving before they came out for breakfast or otherwise helping my kid too. It's a tough balance.\n\nYTA because you didn't warn your son. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that you can't help a kid in need because it will upset your child because I know you probably aren't able to do that. I could never walk away from a teen in trouble. They trust so few people and when they are willing to talk, you better be ready to listen because who knows when they will again.  being a teen or young adult is SO hard, between the emotions, drama, hormones, it's all just a shitshow. I think you owe your son an apology for not warning him. You should probably also apologize to her for putting her in that awkward situation by not telling him she was there.\n\nI hope everything is okay with the young lady. She's lucky to have someone she trusts to call when she needs help.", "YTA\n\nAt the very least you should have warned your son.

I wouldn't abandon a drunk teenager that is reaching out for a place to stay in the middle of the night - you did the right thing there. Ideally, you would have gave your son a heads up before he arrived at the breakfast table but that seems like a minor error after a chaotic evening rather than an asshole move. I would still give your son an apology because that just seems appropriate in the circumstances. He also showed maturity by still offering her a lift home despite the awkwardness. I hope she is OK though and it was just alcohol induced drama and not something more serious.", "From the looks of other comments, I\u2019m gonna get hate for this, but I\u2019m going to say NTA asshole ONLY because it happened in the middle of the night.\n\nI\u2019m assuming the son was asleep. There was no way to warn him without waking him up, and he probably still would have been upset about it if you had. Whatever his ex has going on, I\u2019m glad you helped her and I hope he was more understanding of the situation after learning the specifics of how it happened.\n\nIf something like this had happened in the middle of the day when everyone was awake or it was something you had planned ahead of time to try to \u201cParent Trap\u201d then back together, it\u2019d be a different situation for me.

Once you finish alienating your son and disregarding his feelings, it\u2019ll be good that you have a replacement child lined up and ready to go. \n\nI\u2019m guessing that you\u2019d punish your son for doing something thoughtless and hurtful towards you or your wife. So what do you think your punishment should be? Just because you\u2019re an adult doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean you get to avoid the consequences of your actions. \n\nAnd if your son does something rude, or thoughtless, or uncaring in the future, how are you going to react, considering that you are teaching him that this is acceptable behavior? \n\nNever forget: you only saw what this girl and your son showed you. And you saw what you wanted to see. The fact your son doesn\u2019t feel he can trust you with the reason for the breakup should tell you something. If it turned out this girl has a substance abuse problem, and her personality changed drastically when she\u2019s under the influence, what then? What if you found out she was manipulative? Cruel? Or just a regular bully to others. Would you accept the truth, or defend her? \n\nYTA", "Your kid needs to come first. Not his ex.

At the very least, you could have told him before he walked into the kitchen.", "Mostly NTA fort helping a clearly intoxicated young person get to a safe place to sober up. \nKinda YTA for not giving him a heads up bc he's still a kid (legally an adult) and that can take a toll on his mental and change his perception of his parents from loving and supportive to back stabbing and betraying. \n\nEither way it's a shitty situation for sure but getting her to a safe place takes priority imo as a father.", "YTA.  He\u2019s your son, she\u2019s a girl who broke up with him for whatever reason.  I can see having her for the night for safety purposes.  But not informing your son was asinine.

You haven't given us enough information to suggest she actually did need a place to stay (and had nowhere else to stay). I don't care how close you were with her while she was with your son.

You are prioritizing this girl over your kid. You have no idea what happened between them and you\u2019re not showing him respect as an adult.", "YTA.\n\nI get giving the girl a place to safely crash for the night.

It may have been for a final talk, or whatever. It may have been to try and hang out as friends. You don't know.\n\nBut here's what really makes you the AH. You're supposed to be a safe place for your children, first and foremost. Right now he needs a safe place to heal his heart, and figure things out.

She broke your child's heart. Your lack of loyalty to your son is astounding. The fact that she felt comfortable enough to contact you is weird.\n\nSecondly, when she called, you made a decision to bring someone who hurt your son into his home, his safe space. You never once spoke to him to ask if he minded her coming over, nor did you warn him that she would be there. You took away his consent and comfort in his own home.\n\nIf the ex girlfriend was distressed and needed a place to stay that evening and you felt compelled to help her, you could've booked her into a hotel to give her a place to stay.\n\nPlease have some respect and loyalty to your son and tell her to back off.", "YTA\u2026 you should have poked your head into his room and warned him so he could have pretended to sleep in or something to avoid her.

While I understand this is a tough situation, and my ex was in a tough situation as well, to an 18 year old (I was the same age at the time) living with my ex put a big stain on my relationship with my mom. It made me feel like he was more important to her than I was. Especially cause I was made to feel like an AH for not wanting him there. After he left he ended up stalking me, so the close proximity clearly wasn\u2019t healthy for him. Not that that\u2019s what would come of this situation but I would hope that OP and the girlfriend would discuss if there were more options and it\u2019s shitty to offer your home to someone without consulting everyone who lives there, including the son.", "Awesome question", "Agree.

I think it's an adult who did their best to help a vulnerable teenager in what was a potential emergency. Do I think they handled it badly and fumbled the situation? I definitely do! I don't think it's quite 'maintaining a relationship' with the ex though.. OP didn't even recognize the number when the ex called. He didn't reach out or go looking for her. He extended a helping hand ( TEMPORARILY) to a distressed teenager who called for help.", "Disagree 100% with your first assertion. They are adults and can have a relationship with whomever they want, even a child's ex. \n\nBut for part two, YTA.  They should have warned the son that she was coming over and staying the night so he could act accordingly and avoid her.", "Oh, she doesn\u2019t have a bad bone in her.", "Yes, I caught that too. Offering a ride despite being annoyed by it all shows empathy.

Their physical safety comes first, but understanding the awareness is important too.", "A text message warning the son, catching him before he reached the kitchen, a note on the door... Nope, no way to communicate this info without waking him up.", "He\u2019s not an AH for helping her out he\u2019s an AH for not warning the son then forcing him to be around her when he tried to skip out.", "That makes sense, but surprises in the early morning are never pleasant. Should've stopped him before he left his room in the morning...or even texted (assuming he's a stereotypical teen who checks his phone often).", "She probably cheated on Halloween but wants him to forgive her. YTA. Your son needs a safe space & your home is no longer it, you could have texted him a heads up.", "Outside your house? Or youve seen her in your house? Like they still hang out?", "Yeah, imo the issue here isn't that OP still has a relationship with the ex, the issue here is that he didn't tell his son.", "I disagree. Letting her crash in a potentially dangerous situation? Fine. No issues there. But this isn't just an oopsies about not warning him. Aside from that:\n\n\\- They actively encouraged a breakfast with her.  Pretty clearly intent on having them interact. Not just sheltering and feeding her for safety reasons.\n\n\\- \"it was evident they still clearly like each other.\" In the context of her safety, why the fuck is this relevant? If anything, the clear observation that emotions are still heavily involved would be an obvious signal to the parents of why this would be a distressing situation for the son.\n\n\\-  \"She cut her stay short.\" Huh? This wasn't a planned vacation. She spontaneously called at night. They kept her safe for the night and fed her in the morning. She was now sober. The situation was successfully dealt with. Why would he be under the impression that she'd need to stay longer?\n\nThere is very obviously more to this than, \"we prioritized her immediate safety and misjudged how he'd feel about seeing her sitting in the kitchen.\" They very clearly want her presence around the house and, specifically, their son. I'd bet they're hoping they get back together. It is a major violation of boundaries and a complete disregard for his feelings.", ">A teenager who called a trusted adult for help when they needed it.\n\nI get what you're saying, but the adult is betraying their own child's trust and potentially putting them in danger, or at the very least massive discomfort.\n\nTalk to the girl and work out a solution or find her another place to sleep (a motel?).  Don't risk your own son, especially without even letting him know.", "I think it was right for OP to go and help her. Even letting her spend the night (maaaaaaybe), but he definitely should have warned his son and not encouraged him to sit and eat when both were clearly uncomfortable. Best case scenario he should have taken ex-gf home or given her a ride home before breakfast", "They can, it is still weird. I don't understand why they would want to retain a relationship with someone who they likely have very little in common with and who has clearly distressed their son. It would be different were it an ex-wife or the mother of their grandchildren but it isn't.

Surely there are many reasons for that, that doesn't automatically mean that your son wouldn't still be surprised and upset at seeing her when he wasn't expecting it, and doesn't mean your son has got over his heartbreak either. You absolutely cannot magically detect if they both have feelings for each other either, it sounds like you want them to get back together, and partly did this/didn't warn son so you could have a surprise romantic reunion between them\n\nEdit - also, since they broke up, how often has she been at your house invited by your son?

So when I finally had enough and ended the relationship, my parents took HIS side, saying I was making a big mistake, I was being immature, yada yada... it didn't matter if I tried to explain my point of view, it was swiftly dismissed.\nYou know what they got after all this? Me, being 38 now, and never letting them to know ANY of my partners after that one, nothing more than a \"yes, this is [whoever I'm seeing at the moment], bye\". No visits, no meetings, no lunches, dinners or get togethers. Which obviously has caused innumerable complaints from my parents, saying I'm \"cold\", \"detached\" and \"a stranger\".\nThey broke my trust by choosing someone else other than me, their actual daughter.

I can't imagine being half awake and trying to navigate that situation.  OP could at least have sent him a text.", "Did you not think to ask why there was this unexpected person in your home?", "Easy to say after the fact reading it on the internet while sipping coffee what you would do. Like in reality you got woken up still dumbfounded in the middle of the night by a crying teenager it's normal to not first think what would my son say.", "I don't. Unless my work left a message or I have a few missed calls from the same person I don't check my text/ WhatsApp/ voicemail messages until I am having my coffee break at work.", ">Abusive partners exist, fact.\n>\n>OP hasn't the foggiest clue why their son and the gf broke up, also fact.\n\n #4 on FBI most wanted list exists, fact.\n\nOP doesn't know who #4 on FBI most wanted list is, also fact.\n\nWhy are any of these facts relevant?", "The vast majority of abusers are male, the odds of a an 18 year old abusing her bf are so, so astronomically low.", "I was about to say this. Haha and if he didn\u2019t see that you can at least explain you tried to let him know. Also, they shouldn\u2019t have made him sit down for breakfast too and make things more awkward.\n\nWhat makes the parents the AH, is how their son simply explained his feelings and what went wrong pretty maturely and they still don\u2019t get it. The son laid it out pretty clearly. He should have at least been given a heads up in some way. Which is totally understandable. He didn\u2019t say they shouldn\u2019t have done it at all and left her to be in danger. He just wanted to know that due to something happening his ex had to spend the night in the guest bedroom. \n\nI don\u2019t know if she abused him like someone else said. But at the very least, my ex and I are on amicable terms and still friends. However if I woke up one morning and he was just there without any warning. I\u2019d be just as upset as this kid. It\u2019s 2023. You can text your son at the very least.\n\nEdit: OP maybe not an AH if they here this feedback and make things right. AH is pretty strong. But I do think the son was right and the mistake was not telling him. And they will be an AH if they dismiss his feelings after hearing all this feedback.", "This is not the silver bullet argument that you think it is.", "No?
