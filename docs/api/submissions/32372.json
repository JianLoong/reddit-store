Tell her she has 2 weeks to leave.", "NTA. If she can afford a vacation she can afford a security deposit. It's your home and she's taking advantage of you", "NTA - ask yourself if it\u2019s wrong to kick a leech out. She doesn\u2019t help in any way shape or form, she don\u2019t contribute even when she\u2019s able but creates messes and run up bills. She\u2019s a full grown adult so she should be ashamed of herself in the first place. Kick her out and let her keep to her words living in her car.", "Yikes!  NTA!  Your kindness has been taken advantage of to the detriment of your new marriage!  \n\nYou have a fiscally irresponsible freeloader who is an adult, but throws tantrums like a teenager.\n\nI second the idea of looking into the laws of your state and serve her with eviction papers, a final date when she should be moved out and take care that she isn\u2019t trashing your house and her living area where she stays in your house in the meantime (take photos in case she damages things in your house) because putting your foot down and shutting off the gravy train may make her vindictive and vengeful.

Stick with it. Yes, that means being ready to evict her ass.  Since apartment living is beneath her, let her live in her car if she chooses, but be clear, *your* home is no longer an option.", "No, you WNBTA. \n\nEnough is enough, you are not required to subsidize your cousin forever. She's way - WAY - overstayed her welcome.", "NTA", "A month or two means a month or two, perhaps 3 months at most.  You should have kicked her out after 3 months, 9 months is being more than generous.\n\nIf I needed help, I'd be cleaning and cooking and helping as much as possible.  My first year out of college, I lived with my uncle for free (he was a widow).  I cleaned his entire 3-bedroom house except his bedroom & bathroom (his choice) and did my best to cook (I was learning).  That's what she should have done but chose not to.  I was 22, not 37.  You're NTA.", "\u201cbeing able to fly around on vacations\u201d\n\nWTF?\n\nDefinitely evict her, but find out how to do it legally.", "NTA... EVICT HER IMMEDIATELY \n\nSave your relationship.\n\nShe has the ability to pay and she chooses not to. This makes her an egocentric user. She will never be greatful so there is no point in prolonging the inevitable.", "YTA for not evicting her sooner! If he presence is having a negative impact on your marriage then you should have asked her to move out months ago. This agreement was meant to be for a couple of months and now it\u2019s been 9 months and she doesn\u2019t contribute to any household bills or even helps clean up like she promised she would? No wonder your husband is frustrated because you are a door mat all in the name of \u201cfamily\u201d. \n\nHow to deal with this situation is to give her the legal notice period to leave the property which depending on where you are could be 14-30 days notice. Maybe even have a free consultation with a lawyer about the correct steps to take and have her legally served so she can\u2019t deny it at a later day. Expect some backlash for other lazy and entitled family members but just draw up a list of their names and then hand it to your cousin as a list of family who are willing to help her and then block them. If you feel like your financial situation isn\u2019t great then look at renting a room out but get a proper contract next time and be willing to evict at the first sign of trouble.", "I will definitely look at some news stories, I did not think about that, thank you. She moved in 5 months after I got married to my husband and this has been a large learning curve in our relationship", "Just make sure you consult with a housing/eviction attorney, even if it is a one time/hourly conversation just to make sure you follow proper procedures. \n\nYou could end up spending a lot more money if you don't do things properly.", "dont do that. After 9 months they're likely considered a tenant and you have to actually legally evict them and serve them proper legal notice.", "Great answer!  The cousin may be vindictive and try to cause damage as her \"parting gift\" to you for kicking her out. \n\nYes, take photos of your home before she potentially causes physical damage. That way you'll have the documentation if she does retaliate.\n\nAlso as you prepare to serve her with an eviction notice, lock up your jewelry, any emergency money you keep on hand, extra car keys, etc. Just in case.\n\nBTW: If the cousin sees that you are serious about evicting her, and she offers to pay a few bucks rent from now on, *no--it's too late.* She doesn't respect your husband's rules or privacy. If she doesn't go, chance are your husband will.", "It sounds like the cousin is more of a roommate than a tenant, and the laws pertaing to roommates are a lot less strict thsn they are with tenants.\n\nOP talk to a lawyer, or to the landlord/tenant board, or the equivalent to what there is where you are, before you kick her out. Find out what your legal rights and obligations are.\nNTA for wanting to kick out an ungrateful, lazy parasite.", "Legally she's probably a 'lodger' since she's living in an owner-occupied home. Rules for getting her out are probably a lot less restrictive than they would be for a tenant."]}
