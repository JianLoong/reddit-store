After some back and forth, they say that it isn\u2019t fair that I get to do absolutely no work during my time off, while they will still have to work from home when it comes to their holidays.

Thankfully the other 2 team members said that they are capable of doing the work, and that was that.\n\nLast week, I was arranging with my 2 teammates on how to manage the workload for their week off for Christmas, since it was the work of 2 people, I told them I could swing it without bothering them for the whole week. The new coworkers overheard and were like \u201c2 people? What about us?\u201d, I told them straight away that I will not be taking on any of their work, that they did not help me for the last 3 holidays, and I was not helping them now. I also asked why they were surprised, considering I did not do any of their work previously. All they could come up with was \u201cBut this is Christmas.\u201d\n\nThey went to our manager, and he told them exactly what he told me.

First things of the year matter like the being up to see the first sunrise of the year, the first shrine visit, etc.  There are traditional foods and decorations, kids get money from grandparents and other adults, so I guess it checks pretty much the same boxes as Christmas.", "Either way OP is NTA so I'm not sure what your point is.", "The Problem is that the two new coworkers could escalete it higher up and Ruin it for everyone.", "Maybe.  They were dumb enough to screw themselves out of a pretty sweet work deal. Perhaps they are dumb enough to screw their coworkers out of it too.  But I guarantee, just like this, it will bite them in the butt.  \n\nAlienating some of your coworkers is a nuisance.  Alienating ALL of your coworkers is a fast ride to work hell.  At that point, it's literally just a matter of how long they last when everyone else wants them gone.", "I'm not getting confused, I think you're missing the point being argued though.\n\nThere's no requirement for them to be obligated to honor any person's religious holidays, which is the specific claim that I'm talking about. And if there was, specific text in law could be pointed to to back that up (which hasn't happened. You say \"to stick to law\" without quoting any law backing up the rest of that). And if they were actually obligated to honor someone's religious holidays, then you couldn't write this: \"and the employer wont/can't let everyone off for all of them, they must share\". You have a \"won't\" in here, but if this was a legal obligation, this wouldn't be optional.\n\nOf more note, there's no guarantee that all employees have to get \"equal time off\" (that's an overly broad statement, and employees frequently don't so that shouldn't be viewed as a standard starting point), and if they just gave one person a religious holiday off every time, but never let anyone else take it off, that would also not be religious discrimination if that group was all the same religion because there was no discrimination based on religion there (it would reflect favoritism though, so this isn't saying it's good, just that as described would be legal). I think there would be quite a good argument, though, that it was religious discrimination if, in that example, one employee got 9 days off in 9 years because of their religion and the other employees only got 1 day off in 9 years because of their religion.\n\nWhat actually happens, in practice, is that employers will often have two sorts of policies, they will have days/times where they close because it's not worth it to staff and they may also have time off that individuals can apply for (be it for holidays or vacation or whatever). None of that reflects them being \"obligated to honor your religious holidays\". They're making decisions based on when they can staff and when they can't. Businesses that, say, are closed for Christmas aren't still making the non-Christian employees show up and just sit there. They're just closed the same as they would be on any other closed day generally. It's not making decisions based on religion, and either doesn't really allow anyone to try to request time off, or leaves it to employees to go through some consistent system (without regard for religion) to get their time off.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in this case, OP has basically said this was an informal arrangement so that everyone could get some extra time off and not official days off, so if the employer isn't actually giving anyone time off for holidays, then they are behaving consistently so there would be zero grounding to say that it's favoring one religion at that point. The Christians are also supposed to work their religious days, they just cut a deal with OP to get around that. So the person I responded to is arguing that those religious holidays (in general) must be honored as opposed to not being honored (in general). It's a consistent employer policy.\n\n\nMore broadly, I also think what you're saying is actually advocating for direct religious discrimination, specifically because it's linked to a claim about religious holidays, because it is also saying that those who do not believe in holidays can't get time off because they don't have them. There's also no weird quota system where you identify religious holidays and the religions of your employees and then divvy up religious holidays to them, and it certainly would be religious discrimination if they did that because it would mean that people would be getting paid/treated differently explicitly based on their religion.", "If you could read it and it said what you claimed, you could quote the text where it says that about religious holidays specifically.\n\nThrowing aside burden of proof for a moment, I could just as easily say that your claim is disproven by the Code of Laws of the United States of America. And then if you questioned where it actually said that, I could say \"if you can't read, sorry\".\n\nYou're confusing substantiating an argument with magic spells, and acting like \"Tittle VII of the civil rights act of 1964\" works the same way that \"abra cadabra\" works where just saying it does something. Backing up your argument would actually involve demonstrating what part of that is applicable to the claim that \"obligated to honor your religious holidays\"", "In all technicality you are right, an employer does not have to honor any holiday at all. However, to put that in to practice they will have to say, everyone is either working (or not) for every holiday for every religion (at least every religion that's represented). That's not going to work in practice. \n\n1. No one is going to work a job where they are required to work every holiday, no exceptions.\n\n2. No employer is going to give everyone off on every holiday. They won't do this because it wouldn't be feasible for them. They cannot refuse to hire someone based on religion. So even if by chance, all their employees celebrate the same holidays, that would mean in order to keep up with their way of employment they would have to only hire people who celebrate the same holidays as everyone else. Otherwise they would have to start giving everyone off on more days in order to avoid discrimination issues. \n\nYes, employers do divvy up holidays quite often. If you take off this holiday, you have to work that holiday. If you work that holiday, you get off this holiday. That is a very, very common practice. Especially when talking about things like Christmas as the majority of people celebrate, regardless of their actual religious views. It can end up being tricky to make sure the laws are followed. Again though, the only way to completely avoid it is to say everyone gets off, or everyone works every holiday. The former would probably end up putting them under because of lost revenue. The latter would put them.under because they wouldn't have employees.\n\nJust like everything, it's not black and white and it's complex. That's why most places have employees sign up for what holidays they won't work, and which they will. A lot of the time they will go by senority for who gets first choice, and then they will rotate so everyone gets equal chance. \n\nYou are correct that the OP and coworkers had an informal arrangement (which is another way employers handle the holidays), but the boss just turned a blind eye because that was the easiest way to cover his ass. Its can be extremely complicated. That's also why when lawsuits come up regarding discrimination, the whole is looked at, not just the individual. No two cases are alike either. So we could sit here for years debating it. It wouldn't matter bc it's not really something you can pin down without it actually happening in practice. Again, the only way to truly do it like that would be everyone works, or everyone is off. But thaynwould have to encompass all holidays that are represented in the company. Which means everything would have to be reevaluated everytime someone is hired or fired, which wouldn't actually allow a company to function.", "Where does it \"literally\" state that employers have to allow time off?

Yes that would include for them to actually manage people, and put on them big boys pants and tell the newcomer to stop being stupid. But I'm probably thinking as an awfull socialist communist European.", "NTA\n\nThat's kind of special actually. That they actually expected help when they didn't help. The best is that the manager gave them the exact same response you got!  LMFAO!!!", "INFO: Don't people just get time off during holidays? Why is it your responsibility to figure out who does your work in the meantime? US is so weird man....", "And [your holiday] is more important than [my holiday] because...? NTA", "Chile pls. Them ppl know better. NTA", "*** Surprised pikachu face***\n\nhahahaha love your story.\n\n\nmy first line is all you need to send them as a reply. NTA wahahahahahahahaomg can't stop laughing at their ineptitude. read tf room lol", "NTA. I'm happy you did so, like really happy for theirs' selfish ass misery \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA they are reaping what they sowed.", "NTA.  You can't expect someone to do favors for you and you do nothing in return for them.  If you're willing let them know that they can have the same deal that you have with your other coworkers, after Christmas that is.", "nta. and it's weird u even have to ask", "\"But it's Christmas!\"\n\"Yes, that's how I feel and my Holy Days... get the point now??\"\n\nNTA", "NTA they went back on the deal they joined in on. They refused to help you so now they have to deal with the consequences of their actions.", "NTA.  Covering for co-workers was a two-way street.  You covered for them and they covered for you, although the difference in numbers meant they had to do some work from home. Your new co-workers chose not to participate and cover for you.  There is no reason on earth for you to cover for them.  Not even if it's Christmas.  Not even if it were the Second Coming.  If they continue to moan about this on religious grounds , send them to Galatians 6:7. The part about reaping what you sow.  Maybe next time they'll sow.", "no you are not the asshole\n\nwhere are my free updoots, reddit bros?!!!!", "NTA but can't people book holidays off?", "This guy is a legend not an asshole", "ok i am sorry but what kind of company is this ??? \nYou are not allowed to take time off ?? seriously ? \n\ni can understand that you all need to coordinate your vacations so some of the team continue the work but seriously if everyone is working, you can\u2019t take one week off without their permission ??", "Ah, natural justice in action. NTA, and good for you, OP!", "NTA. They backed out of the deal first. I can\u2019t believe they would expect the time when they treated you this way.", "Not just a fundamental truism but a tenet of Christianity (Matthew 7:12), so kinda ironic for these people who seem so devoted to Christmas. OP is totally NTA.", "Selfish people have to learn the hard way.", "Whenever I\u2019m reminded that KFC is huge in Japan for Christmas I have to marvel at their marketing. It\u2019s really not that good.  Not that bad, but not *good*.", "That literally goes both ways. The new hires refused to build an alliance with him, so why should he do the same? They made their decision and reacted accordingly. What you are suggesting is that he allow these people to walk all over him for the sake of diplomacy and that\u2019s ridiculous.", "Why is OP the asshole?\n\nThis worked for everyone else and they were all happy with it\n\nOP is forcing them to join in, just refusing to do their work over the holidays when they didn\u2019t help him out\n\nThey didn\u2019t do his work but still expected him to do theirs, how is OP the asshole?", "I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.", "The OP states that the agreement includes Thanksgiving and that they weren't just hired recently. OP also states that \"When it was time for the first religious holiday that I was going to be off on, they refuse to do their share of my work\" which strongly implies they had no problem not going in on Thanksgiving. So yeah they would have reneged on the deal.", ">It's like the UK saying that the EU applying third country rules is \"punishing the UK for leaving the EU\".\n\nFunny you chose this as the example... I have seen this exact claim a *lot*.", "Say whaaat?!", "*Because it\u2019s CHRISTMAS!!!*/s\ud83d\ude44\n\nLet\u2019s be real; they wanted their holidays because they think those are\nThe only ones that matter. \n\nNTA- if someone doesn\u2019t Hold up their end of a bargain you\u2019re under no obligation to hold up yours. They backed out of the deal- let them deal with what their selfishness brought them. Anyone with half a brain could see how this was gonna go. There\u2019s no surprise to what op was going to do. Thinking these two are about the only people who couldn\u2019t figure it out.\n\nMaybe if they wish really hard and truly believe Santa will bring them the gift of common sense.", "They are certainly not the sharpest knives in the drawer. What did they expect?", "I'd guess it wasn't stupidity so much as an erroneous assumption that if they pitched a big enough fit they'd get their way.", "I think an important point is that they're religious and the lady and her son aren't religious at all.", "Nope @sportsnco is right, let it go", "That whole thing is a large non sequitur because the whole premise has been the claim that employers were \"obligated to honor your religious holidays\", which they aren't.\n\nAnd a whole lot of baseless attempts at axiomatic claims. For example (to focus on just one part of that), an employer can decide to simply not be open a particular day. That is absolutely putting into practice not \"honoring\" anyone's religious holidays, it reflects them choosing to be open based on if it's worth it to the business to do so.\n\nThere's no basis on law for the vast majority of what you said, or a basis in general for claims of how businesses work. There's absolutely people who have jobs that don't really account for holidays, for example (my wife's working Christmas, and has heard that no one who had Christmas on their normal weekly availability of working Sundays is getting the day off, even if they requested it. It's a major employer that doesn't have to care if people want the holiday off, and as they expect to be busy that day, aren't giving people that day off. And I've worked for employers that did the same thing. In contrast, I now work for an employer that is entirely closed for Christmas, and I've worked for other employers in the past that closed for Christmas and no one outside of maintenance worked that day, no matter their religious views)\n\n\"So we could sit here for years debating it. It wouldn't matter bc it's not really something you can pin down without it actually happening in practice.\"\n\nThe initial claim about the employer having an obligation is more than a hypothetical. Were that actually true, there would be something to point to that specifies said obligation. Instead people are just making up things and pretending that the law backs them up without anything to substantiate that. There remains nothing backing up the claim that an employer is \"obligated to honor your religious holidays\" in the US", "I do not have a lot of knowledge when it comes to discrimination issues around religion. My experience has been around disability issues. I for sure did not lay out what I know very well, I do see that now. Most of my on the religion aspect comes from trying to follow a very convoluted problem that happened to my SIL from years ago. The only religious discrimination issue I had ended before it really started, and that was a clear cut discrimination issue.\n\n My ex boss tried to deny a day off due to him thinking that my belief system is \"evil and wrong, and there is no way that someone who has a single brain cell would even think it would qualify as religious beliefs.... i needed to pull my head out of my ass and go to church and pray harder than anyone has ever prayed that I don't end up burning in hell for eternity.\" Guess that's what someone can expect from a disgusting old fat southern Christian man who would remotely take over work comps and watch porn. I really wish I was making this up too, I know how unreal it sounds. Sadly, he existed (or does idk if he is still alive or not), he was used to being able to walk over his employees bc he hired young girls who didn't know their rights and/or were to afraid to stand up for themselves. This was the only place I ever dealt with issues on religion first hand, and that was the extent of it. That wasn't hard at all to show him how much trouble he had just got himself in with those words. Disability discrimination is it's own demon which affects me so much more, so thats where I put my time and effort into in order to protect myself.", "I never once said they were obligated to. You keep getting stuck on that. But again, think what you want. I have no reason or need to delete my comments nor do I really care to rewrite them. I wasn't very clear in what I said, I do understand that. Shit happens, especially when you really don't pay attention to how something is said. Which, again, I have already said was my mistake. You can keep saying the same thing over and over all day if you want, it doesn't change that I never once claimed employers are obligated to give holidays off because \"religion\"", ">\tI do not have a lot of knowledge when it comes to discrimination issues around religion. \n\nObviously, because \u201cyou have to give me this day off work because of my religion\u201d isn\u2019t a legal requirement of employers. They can\u2019t have a policy that says \u201conly Christians get their holidays off,\u201d but a neutral policy like \u201cyou have to put in your time off requests X days in advance and we can deny them if other people will already be out\u201d isn\u2019t discrimination."]}
