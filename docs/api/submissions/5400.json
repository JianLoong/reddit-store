But at least they will not have to come to the office. BTW there are 5 people in my team.\n\nIn exchange they handle **all** my work for me during my holidays. Our managers were ok with this arrangement, and they would turn a blind eye to some of us not coming to the office for days on end. For Christmas I would usually take on their work from the 20th to the 28th. \n\nFast foreward to earlier this year, two of my older coworkers retired, but they trained their replacements before leaving. They brought up the deal with them and they seemed on board. When it was time for the first religious holiday that I was going to be off on, they refuse to do their share of my work. After some back and forth, they say that it isn\u2019t fair that I get to do absolutely no work during my time off, while they will still have to work from home when it comes to their holidays. We tried to explain that it is easier for 4 people to cover a single person\u2019s work, while it is impossible for a single person to take on 5 peoples\u2019 work. They still said it wasn\u2019t fair.\n\nI tried talking with my manager, but he said he couldn\u2019t do anything, since this was a very informal arrangement, and he couldn\u2019t force them to participate. That was fair, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I wasn\u2019t frustrated. Thankfully the other 2 team members said that they are capable of doing the work, and that was that.\n\nLast week, I was arranging with my 2 teammates on how to manage the workload for their week off for Christmas, since it was the work of 2 people, I told them I could swing it without bothering them for the whole week. The new coworkers overheard and were like \u201c2 people? What about us?\u201d, I told them straight away that I will not be taking on any of their work, that they did not help me for the last 3 holidays, and I was not helping them now. I also asked why they were surprised, considering I did not do any of their work previously. All they could come up with was \u201cBut this is Christmas.\u201d\n\nThey went to our manager, and he told them exactly what he told me.

The employer cannot say \"I'm sorry you cannot have off for all of your holidays because, despite you being the only one that celebrates them, and even though when they are does not overlap anyone else's holidays, I can't give you all of them.off because it's not fair to the other employees who share the same beliefs system/holidays.\" That would be discrimination. \n\nIt's rare that things like that do happen because most holidays, regardless of religion (or even reason of celebrating them) happen around the same time of year. So, even if people celebrate different holidays, they will have to share time off because they fall around the same time.", "Title 7 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. \n\nNone of that has to do with giving someone a holiday off of work.", "It literally does. It states that if a reasonable accommodation can be made by an employer to allow a religious holiday off they must allow the time off", "Private employers do not have to give employees time off on holidays or provide premium pay to those who work under federal law.", "If you have more than 15 employees you are in fact subject to the law", "Federal holidays are public holidays declared by the country\u2019s federal government and recognized by law (Federal Law \u2013 5 U.S.C. 6103). These holidays are paid holidays for many employees, and many non-essential offices remain closed. However, legally, employers are not required to give their employees time off during federal holidays. Furthermore, employers are not required to pay their employees if they grant them the day off. \n\nSadly, the law views holidays as just another business day, so whether or not you have to work is entirely up to your employer\u2019s discretion if you work for a private company."]}
