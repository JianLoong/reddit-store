So I will be very vague. Sorry.\n\nI(M) have been working in this company for a number of years, I am not Christian, nor am I American. That is to say that I do not mind working on Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter or the 4th of July. On the other hand, I come from a religion that has 3 major holidays, and those I prefer to not work on.\n\nWhen I first started working here we came to an arrangement: I would handle the office work during their holidays, but since I can\u2019t do it all on my own, they will have to still do some stuff from home. But at least they will not have to come to the office. BTW there are 5 people in my team.\n\nIn exchange they handle **all** my work for me during my holidays. Our managers were ok with this arrangement, and they would turn a blind eye to some of us not coming to the office for days on end. For Christmas I would usually take on their work from the 20th to the 28th. \n\nFast foreward to earlier this year, two of my older coworkers retired, but they trained their replacements before leaving. They brought up the deal with them and they seemed on board. When it was time for the first religious holiday that I was going to be off on, they refuse to do their share of my work. After some back and forth, they say that it isn\u2019t fair that I get to do absolutely no work during my time off, while they will still have to work from home when it comes to their holidays. We tried to explain that it is easier for 4 people to cover a single person\u2019s work, while it is impossible for a single person to take on 5 peoples\u2019 work. They still said it wasn\u2019t fair.\n\nI tried talking with my manager, but he said he couldn\u2019t do anything, since this was a very informal arrangement, and he couldn\u2019t force them to participate. That was fair, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I wasn\u2019t frustrated. Thankfully the other 2 team members said that they are capable of doing the work, and that was that.\n\nLast week, I was arranging with my 2 teammates on how to manage the workload for their week off for Christmas, since it was the work of 2 people, I told them I could swing it without bothering them for the whole week. The new coworkers overheard and were like \u201c2 people? What about us?\u201d, I told them straight away that I will not be taking on any of their work, that they did not help me for the last 3 holidays, and I was not helping them now. I also asked why they were surprised, considering I did not do any of their work previously. All they could come up with was \u201cBut this is Christmas.\u201d\n\nThey went to our manager, and he told them exactly what he told me. Now they are angry, apparently they promised their families a week of free time, and one of them even booked tickets to spend Christmas with his family in another state.

You should just ignore them let them be mad about having to their work.", "NTA\n\nTurnabout is FairPlay. If you want to be part of team, gaining favors, then you have to be willing to sacrifice, too. You gave them a fair deal so you all could have some time off, and they rejected their half of the bargain.\n\nJust don\u2019t expect any favors from these guys in the future.", "NTA.\n\nEverything is a give and take and they aren't doing that.

You are giving them the same treatment they gave you", "NTA- what goes around comes around. What did they expect? That they could screw you over and you would do their work with a smile?

On the other hand, it is more than possible to cover a single person work during for the same 4 people. It would probably add up to something like 1-2h per these days maximum (most likely even less if splited correctly). \n\nAnd I love their argument \"But it's Christmas\" like it is an universal celebration for whole planet and then not thinking the same about your holidays.", "Nope nope nope, NTA .\n\nWho are these AH work colleagues??

You and the older colleagues suck for being complicit in this culture.

Too bad for them.", "Which means there wasn\u2019t an agreement for OP to do their work either", "This isn't their vacation time this is them covering each other when they're supposed to be at work! When they work from home, I can tell you they are still getting paid, you can bet on that? This isn't a normal vacation time, this is co-workers helping each other so they can spend time with friends and family!
