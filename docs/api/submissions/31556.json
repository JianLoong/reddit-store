Background: My stepdaughter has always been daddy's little princess. Her wedding is approaching, and she's turned into a bridezilla, expecting everyone to cater to her whims. She insisted on a lavish affair, and I'm expected to play the role of the loving stepmom. Here's the kicker \u2013 she never accepted me into the family and always treated me like an outsider.\n\nSo, after years of enduring her subtle jabs and snide comments, I've had enough. I told my husband that I won't be attending the wedding. Why should I pretend to be happy for her when she never showed me any respect? Now, my husband and his entire family are furious with me, claiming I'm ruining her special day. Am I the asshole for standing up for myself and refusing to play the role of the supportive stepmom after years of being treated like an afterthought?\n\nEdit: Wow, I've been reading through the comments, and I realize many of you think I'm the asshole. It's given me some perspective, and I appreciate the different viewpoints. I want to provide more details on how my stepdaughter has treated me over the years.\n\nHer disrespectful behavior wasn't always overt but manifested in subtle yet hurtful ways. She consistently excluded me from family discussions and events, making it clear I wasn't considered an integral part of the family. Rare acknowledgments were often accompanied by dismissive comments or condescending tones. On various occasions, she compared me unfavorably to her biological mother, emphasizing that my husband was happier when he was with her. These accumulated instances of disrespect made it challenging to connect and contributed to my decision not to attend her wedding.\n\nMy husband, who invited me to the wedding, hasn't been the best at managing the dynamic between his daughter and me. He often downplayed her disrespectful behavior, urging me to \"let it slide\" for the sake of family harmony. This lack of acknowledgment and support added to the strain on our relationship. The wedding became a breaking point, as he expected me to play the supportive stepmother despite the years of disrespect. It's a complex situation, and I'm grappling with how poorly it's been handled on multiple fronts.", "created_utc": 1700745164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1820x3j/aita_for_skipping_my_stepdaughters_wedding_after/", "score": 1965, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe I'm not the asshole for standing up for myself and refusing to play a role that I've never been truly accepted in. The constant disrespect has taken its toll, and attending the wedding would feel like an insincere act.\n2.Some might see me as the asshole because, despite the strained relationship, attending my stepdaughter's wedding could be viewed as a gesture of support and goodwill. They may argue that family events are about putting differences aside for the sake of the occasion and that my absence could be seen as unnecessarily causing drama or hurt feelings. Additionally, they might feel that my decision adds stress and negativity to what should be a joyous event for my stepdaughter.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My dad remarried by the time I was 5 and my (now ex) stepmother felt that she was in competition with my sisters and I. We were made to feel like Cinderella, constantly cleaning and doing things for her yet not being able to be kids. If we needed or wanted to go somewhere on a weekend we were at their house, we only got a ride one way and had to figure out transportation for the other direction. She would make underhanded comments that were clearly directly at our mother. Of course our dad was complicit in this, but she also made sure that she got what she wanted and usually it was at the expense of us kids. I hit a breaking point where I finally had enough, broke down and shared all of my feelings to both her and my dad, and she ended up telling me that it was all in my head. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that the above is your or your stepdaughter\u2019s experience, but I hope it helps provide context to how kids can feel neglected when a parent remarries.\n\nCan you provide context around her parents\u2019 divorce? How did you and your husband come to get married? Having divorced parents is hard and then also additional marriages can be overwhelming for kids. She may have said hurtful things as a child, but have you acknowledged that she was A CHILD and simply processing the change in family dynamics? I think you need to stop making assumptions about your stepdaughter\u2019s apparent malicious intent and instead come to the table with open ears considering you\u2019ve been the adult during this whole relationship.\n\nGo to the wedding.

The kid just hates me!\" \n\nNow you want to skip her wedding entirely. In my opinion, there's nothing that matters more in relationships than just showing up. Saying the right thing, getting the right present, everything else, maybe you manage to do that, maybe you don't. But to not even show up?

OP to reddit: Husband invited me.\n\nIf she was literally not named on her husband's invite, she would have said something about her husband getting a +1 invite, not \"my husband invited me\"", "And sending an invite to her father with a +1 is a huge hint towards her father. \n\nI get why OP doesn't want to go, but I have a feeling that this never has been a one way street.", "\u201cOP owes the stepdaughter absolutely nothing,\u201d is ironic considering this is all about OP thinking they are owed things by the stepdaughter.", ">and a wedding is more than just a normal event\n\nBut ultimately it isn't a mother - daughter relationship. The person getting married is just the daughter of the OP's husband. There is zero connection or relationship, there is no legitimate need for her to attend.", "I don\u2019t know maybe concrete examples instead of something that could be the first thing that popped into her mind when people said she didn\u2019t provide any info. Also \u201cexcluding her from family discussions\u201d is extremely broad it could be as simple as I\u2019m talking to my cousin rn so please give us some privacy or actually disrespectful and the whole my dad was happier with mom than with you is literally par for the course for young children of divorce who now have to process the whole step-parent issue.", "The word \"need\" is misplaced.  This is not a matter of necessity.  Rather, it is a matter of making an appearance on one day for a very special occasion because it is the right thing to do.  From the information in the post, the OP is wanted at this wedding.  If there is play pretend, it is that she puts on a good face that she wants to be there.  It's one day.  It means a lot to her husband and his family.  It is a small ask.", "Ok, but it's also just as easy to assume the info we're given is true, the invites went out, she wasn't named, and husband did indeed invite her.  It's just too easy to assume all sorts of things if you also assume OP is an unreliable narrator.  I mean you're assuming she *didn't* say one thing, and then assuming she *would have* said another.", "Right.  I'm guessing the bride couldn't care less if stepmom attends or not.", "I don't know.  We can only work with the info given, but it sounds like OP tried at first, and then gave up in the face of ongoing insults and criticism from the stepdaughter.  The \"daddy's little princess\" comment from OP is, on the surface, questionable, but when it's backed up by the husband's standard \"just let it go\" response, it points toward the husband willfully overlooking his daughter's bad behaviour and ignoring his wife's feelings.", "Even if it isn't one was street, how does it make her an asshole if she doesn't go to a wedding of someone who she mutually doesn't like? Isn't it better to not come and let bride to not see unliked face on her day?", "Right, so why bother?  Like I said, if it's her husband who's salty over her not attending, maybe he should stop and think about how dismissive his standard 'let it go\" response is to his wife's feelings.  That's just condoning his daughter's behaviour to his wife.", "There is absolutely a relationship and connection between a step parent and step child and it\u2019s insane to think otherwise", "This entire sub is one sided stories, nothing is concrete.\n\nOP literally gave examples where her step daughter was disrespectful and how her husband handled it. More information might help, but it doesn't suddenly make the already explained examples acceptable.", "Why? I would think the stepdaughter would be relieved to not have the stepmother whom she dislikes attend.", "How is refusing an invitation disrespectful. It's an invitation, not a subpoena.", "Without a doubt.", "I haven't given any verdict about this, I just have a feeling there's something more here.\n\nBut I agree. It's clear they don't like eachother. Why push it?", "Agree 100%.", "She really didn\u2019t she just gave the broadest examples of things people generally consider to be disrespectful not any one specific example. And while you are right that we only hear one side of the story in this sub people can usually tell when someone is at least trying to be objective over their and other people\u2019s actions or trying to farm sympathy points which is what OP is, intentionally or not, coming off as, notice how all her \u201cexamples\u201d are just things her SD has \u201cdone\u201d and her husband\u2019s reaction never mentioning what she did or said prior to that.", "While I can see where that would often be the case, the original post, even with the edits, seems to indicate otherwise.", "And even subpoenas are optional these days!", "A close relative refusing to attend a wedding is a slap in the face.  A person may not be legally required to go, but that person is very much socially expected to go.", "Yes, the husband is mentally weak, he should just grow a pair and stop worrying about what others think.   \nWhy does the husband need the OPs support? It\u2019s a wedding, what is there to be done that requires her to even be there?   \nHopefully OP stays strong and doesn\u2019t go. If people ask her why she isn\u2019t attending, she can always tell the truth.\n\nIf the step daughter wanted OP there, she should have thought about that in the past."]}
