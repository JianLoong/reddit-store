She\u2019s not planning on using the money for a house, fun money, ect. It was put away for her education and she plans on using it to further her education. You should have talked to her before offering it up and I\u2019m glad her brother was sensible enough to understand that she hadn\u2019t given permission and wanted it given back to her.", "YTA- a massive asshole. And you and your son should be paying that money back to her directly. \n\n1- Just because her life is hectic **right now** doesn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t be ready for that money in 5 or 10 years. \n\n2- Just because she was a good student and got a full ride for her undergrad doesn\u2019t mean she will for her masters or PhD. \n\n3- You just gave away the last thing her father did for her to secure her future. Yes, you contributed, but it is his memory that is stamped on this. \n\n4- Permission to take a class is not permission to give the bulk of it to her brother, \n\n5- You are favoring your son who did not achieve academically to the same extent as your daughter because you believe \u201cshe didn\u2019t need it\u201d.\n\n6- You didn\u2019t fucking ask her. So I think you absolutely knew she would be heartbroken to lose that money especially as she has talked about going back to school someday. \n\nIf you were my mother- and yes- I know what it is like to lose a parent- I think I would be so angry and so hurt I would cut you out of my life.", "YTA. You should have asked. Her telling you you could use a little here and there was not a full blown go ahead to steal from her for your son.
