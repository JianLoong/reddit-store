Our friendship never involved much drama. I agreed to babysit her daughter during the summer because Emily wanted to go abroad for 3 months to take part in some research project important to her career. I wouldn\u2019t babysit all the time but help out in the moments when her husband has longer shifts (sometimes he is gone for 2/3 days). They have no one else to help them out and her daughter is my goddaughter also.\n\nSo another story is when we were in high school I had the biggest crush on Liam. The problem was I was a bit more shy at that time and Emily was very outgoing. She wanted to \u201chelp\u201d me by befriending him but ended up dating him for a long time. I was sour about it but never spoke up. Liam and I talked a bit and I just always felt such a strong connection, we liked similar things, had the same home situation, had the same plans and hopes. Emily was always extremely jealous of Liam so I wasn\u2019t really allowed to talk to him, although she was taking him to every one of our parties. Then they broke up, life moved on, but I honestly never felt such a connection with any other person as I did with Liam. So a few days ago I met Liam at a party and we got drunk and decided on being honest. I told him that I had the biggest feelings towards him back in a day and he said he had a crush on me but Emily told him I\u2019m gay and to not even try with me. She also said not to talk to me about it because it was a secret and I wouldn\u2019t want him to know. She basically lied to make sure I won\u2019t date him.\n\nI was so upset and I confronted her the next day. She told me she did it because she felt I was fixated on him and we just \u201cwouldn\u2019t be good together\u201d. I felt betrayed, manipulated and lied to. I told her it was absolutely wrong of her to lie to him that I\u2019m gay and then date him but she said \u201cwe were teenagers at a time\u201d so I can\u2019t hold it against her. I told her I have to think about it and keep some distance and she told me to not be ridiculous because of some guy. And she said it\u2019s so wrong of me to talk about feelings with her ex. So in the heat of a moment I told her I\u2019m not gonna help her out this summer and I just don\u2019t want to see her. Emily says I can\u2019t be serious as her career is on the line, she can\u2019t say no now. She said I can\u2019t mix something so superficial with a real life job. I said I don\u2019t care and basically left her at that.\n\nShe made a long Facebook post blasting me online for being a bad person. Her husband also contacted me to plead with me, saying I can be mad at Emily but shouldn\u2019t take it out on him and their daughter. I don\u2019t know what to think about it.

Would you be able to maintain contact with the child via her father, without her mother being involved? Again, that will depend on the child\u2019s age & how close you actually are.\n\nI would cut off your pal though, unless she does a massive U-turn & makes a very genuine & deep apology. She lied about your sexuality to get what she wanted, & didn\u2019t (still doesn\u2019t) give a shit about how that would impact you. It may have happened years ago but what other \u201csmall lies\u201d has she told over the years? What other positive things has she stopped you from experiencing? I doubt this situation is the only time she\u2019s ever manipulated you/your feelings or those of others to her advantage.

Tell the husband you\u2019re sorry but they are going to have to figure their babysitting issue out themselves because you can\u2019t be around someone as manipulative as his wife wish him a good life and request they never contact you again.", "NTA as other people have said she is very manipulative. And I notice she didn't say \"I'm sorry, I was jealous and stupid but I never should have done that.\" which still doesn't fix much but She didn't express any remorse at all!\n\nAnd this isn't some small affront like she borrowed a shirt and lost it, or let a personal piece of information slip out. She actively squashed any chance of a relationship with a guy you liked that liked you back by telling a massive, and quite frankly offensive, lie about who you were as a person so he would date her instead. Dating a guy you know your friend likes is already kind of a dick move and could be forgiven in later years as you can't claim someone as yours or dictate who someone can or can't date, she used the pretense of helping you in order to get close to him. She KNOWINGLY did something that would hurt you and has zero remorse. This is a MASSIVE betrayal and breach of trust and BECAUSE she expresses no remorse you can't trust this isn't the first time she has pulled shit like this.\n\n(BTW just to clarify I am NOT saying telling people you are gay when aren't is offensive from a homophobic place. Telling people you are gay when you aren't is offensive because people's sexuality is very personal and important. Casually using it to further your own agenda, essentially weaponizing it seems disrespectful to queer people.)", "NTA. Just based on her reaction and lack of remorse, Emily is not someone you want to have anything to do with. Her husband has a point though.

Best of luck to  you with Liam, I hope it works out.", "She is an ace manipulator and cruel at that. NTA. Her lies took place during your \u201c real life\u201d.

You don't lie and manipulate someone and then, when found out, tell the victim \"it happened when we were teenagers so it doesn't count\". That doesn't fly.

Her Facebook post blasting you proved that she is not the kind of person you want to have in your life.", "I would walk away from her manipulative lying azz and never look back.

I'm pretty sure she's never been a real friend to anyone except herself.

But the girl is your goddaughter and there's some meaning to that. Plus it's kind of uncool to back out of such a large commitment last minute.\n\nSo, I say to use it to your advantage,  combined with a little bit of revenge and justice as well. \n\nTell her you'll agree to babysit, but you want to be paid. That's the least she could do after how shitty she's treated you. Get it in writing, like via email or on paper or something.

You are delusional if you think otherwise, but if you were really upset Liam dated Emily, you should've ended the friendship then.\n\nThis sounds like it was a decade + ago.\n\nLike, here is the deal... you sound like a big pushover, and Emily sounds like someone who always gets their way, so you are sort of TA here b/c this is NOT a good reason for bailing on baby-sitting. You just don't like her, you don't like your role w/ her, you don't like your friendship.  And you found the perfect moment to exact your revenge.\n\nI doubt this was every a healthy, drama-free relationship, but it does suck that you waited for the moment when it really effects her life.

Crushes are not relationships, but if my \"best friend\" was obsessing over my boyfriend, I would feel a bit something about it.  I don't know that calling her gay is the right move, but I could see why Emily was weirded out by this.  (I ditched a friend who once said she wanted to be with my now ex of 6 years, b/c it creeped me the hell out).", "But\u2026OP was into Liam before Emily and him started dating. Are you sure you read the post? You\u2019re making a bunch of assumptions that weren\u2019t in the text at all. You even got the timeline wrong (you said a decade but OP is only 22- per a comment) Plus calling OP delusional based on less than 3k words? What\u2019s going on?\n\nI think you\u2019re identifying with Emily and projecting your own experience onto the post."]}
