Our friendship never involved much drama. I agreed to babysit her daughter during the summer because Emily wanted to go abroad for 3 months to take part in some research project important to her career. I wouldn\u2019t babysit all the time but help out in the moments when her husband has longer shifts (sometimes he is gone for 2/3 days). They have no one else to help them out and her daughter is my goddaughter also.\n\nSo another story is when we were in high school I had the biggest crush on Liam. The problem was I was a bit more shy at that time and Emily was very outgoing. She wanted to \u201chelp\u201d me by befriending him but ended up dating him for a long time. I was sour about it but never spoke up. Liam and I talked a bit and I just always felt such a strong connection, we liked similar things, had the same home situation, had the same plans and hopes. Emily was always extremely jealous of Liam so I wasn\u2019t really allowed to talk to him, although she was taking him to every one of our parties. Then they broke up, life moved on, but I honestly never felt such a connection with any other person as I did with Liam. So a few days ago I met Liam at a party and we got drunk and decided on being honest. I told him that I had the biggest feelings towards him back in a day and he said he had a crush on me but Emily told him I\u2019m gay and to not even try with me. She also said not to talk to me about it because it was a secret and I wouldn\u2019t want him to know. She basically lied to make sure I won\u2019t date him.\n\nI was so upset and I confronted her the next day. She told me she did it because she felt I was fixated on him and we just \u201cwouldn\u2019t be good together\u201d. I felt betrayed, manipulated and lied to. I told her it was absolutely wrong of her to lie to him that I\u2019m gay and then date him but she said \u201cwe were teenagers at a time\u201d so I can\u2019t hold it against her. I told her I have to think about it and keep some distance and she told me to not be ridiculous because of some guy. And she said it\u2019s so wrong of me to talk about feelings with her ex. So in the heat of a moment I told her I\u2019m not gonna help her out this summer and I just don\u2019t want to see her. Emily says I can\u2019t be serious as her career is on the line, she can\u2019t say no now. She said I can\u2019t mix something so superficial with a real life job. I said I don\u2019t care and basically left her at that.\n\nShe made a long Facebook post blasting me online for being a bad person. Her husband also contacted me to plead with me, saying I can be mad at Emily but shouldn\u2019t take it out on him and their daughter. I don\u2019t know what to think about it.

Would you be able to maintain contact with the child via her father, without her mother being involved? Again, that will depend on the child\u2019s age & how close you actually are.\n\nI would cut off your pal though, unless she does a massive U-turn & makes a very genuine & deep apology. She lied about your sexuality to get what she wanted, & didn\u2019t (still doesn\u2019t) give a shit about how that would impact you. It may have happened years ago but what other \u201csmall lies\u201d has she told over the years? What other positive things has she stopped you from experiencing? I doubt this situation is the only time she\u2019s ever manipulated you/your feelings or those of others to her advantage.

Tell the husband you\u2019re sorry but they are going to have to figure their babysitting issue out themselves because you can\u2019t be around someone as manipulative as his wife wish him a good life and request they never contact you again.", "NTA as other people have said she is very manipulative. And I notice she didn't say \"I'm sorry, I was jealous and stupid but I never should have done that.\" which still doesn't fix much but She didn't express any remorse at all!\n\nAnd this isn't some small affront like she borrowed a shirt and lost it, or let a personal piece of information slip out. She actively squashed any chance of a relationship with a guy you liked that liked you back by telling a massive, and quite frankly offensive, lie about who you were as a person so he would date her instead. Dating a guy you know your friend likes is already kind of a dick move and could be forgiven in later years as you can't claim someone as yours or dictate who someone can or can't date, but she used the pretense of helping you in order to get close to him. She KNOWINGLY did something that would hurt you and has zero remorse. This is a MASSIVE betrayal and breach of trust and BECAUSE she expresses no remorse you can't trust this isn't the first time she has pulled shit like this.\n\n(BTW just to clarify I am NOT saying telling people you are gay when aren't is offensive from a homophobic place. Telling people you are gay when you aren't is offensive because people's sexuality is very personal and important. Casually using it to further your own agenda, essentially weaponizing it seems disrespectful to queer people.)", "NTA. Just based on her reaction and lack of remorse, Emily is not someone you want to have anything to do with. Her husband has a point though.

Best of luck to  you with Liam, I hope it works out.", "She is an ace manipulator and cruel at that. NTA. Her lies took place during your \u201c real life\u201d.

You don't lie and manipulate someone and then, when found out, tell the victim \"it happened when we were teenagers so it doesn't count\". That doesn't fly.

Her Facebook post blasting you proved that she is not the kind of person you want to have in your life.", "I would walk away from her manipulative lying azz and never look back. Her child is not your problem anymore, use public social media to let her know that she needs a new Godmother.", "She is not your friend and never was.", "I mean, I'm tempted to say E-S-H because the way you write makes you sound like you're still about 14 years old and writing a Dear Diary entry or a really bad teen romance (\"we decided on being honest\"), and this whole thing was just painful to read. \n\nBut in the interest of fairness and objectivity . . .\n\nNTA\n\nEmily was never your friend. I'm pretty sure she's never been a real friend to anyone except herself.

To her those things happened years ago . . . to you, who just found out about them, the pain is fresh and new, and very real. She also hasn't apologised for doing genuinely horrific shit to you when she was supposed to be your friend; she's only managed to tell you off for her being an awful friend. \n\nYou owe her absolutely nothing, except the delayed consequences for her own behaviour that she is now experiencing.", "I think it doesn\u2019t really matter who the AH is, but if you are willing to end this friendship permanently over this.

Then you might wanna think twice about throwing it away.", "NTA and I completely understand why you'd want to back out of baby sitting. But the girl is your goddaughter and there's some meaning to that. Plus it's kind of uncool to back out of such a large commitment last minute.\n\nSo, I say to use it to your advantage,  combined with a little bit of revenge and justice as well. \n\nTell her you'll agree to babysit, but you want to be paid. That's the least she could do after how shitty she's treated you. Get it in writing, like via email or on paper or something. Make sure you're paid at least half up front. \n\nAnd then when she gets home and pays you the other half, you can cut her out of your life completely and never have to see her again. \n\nBonus points if you call Liam and start dating.

You were never going to date Liam. That is not Emily's fault, even if it was shitty at the time.  You are delusional if you think otherwise, but if you were really upset Liam dated Emily, you should've ended the friendship then.\n\nThis sounds like it was a decade + ago.\n\nLike, here is the deal... you sound like a big pushover, and Emily sounds like someone who always gets their way, so you are sort of TA here b/c this is NOT a good reason for bailing on baby-sitting. You just don't like her, you don't like your role w/ her, you don't like your friendship.  And you found the perfect moment to exact your revenge.\n\nI doubt this was every a healthy, drama-free relationship, but it does suck that you waited for the moment when it really effects her life.

How are you arguing she is pretending to be Emily\u2019s friend while hating her? She\u2019s being very upfront about how she feels.

You do not need a 'friend' like that, and the longer you are in contact with her and her circle, the more drama and abuse you'll likely have to deal with. And definitely reconnect with Liam.

Just a garbage person really.", "Agreed. The only reason to be upset OP talked to her ex was cause she knew she would get caught in a lie and she'd have to suffer the consequences.  She didn't hide it cause she was a teenager,  she hid it  to cover her own butt.", "Finding someone you truly connect with is also sometimes a once in a lifetime opportunity.  Not to mention...  You offered support (physical, emotional, mental, and let's face it monetary support) to her based on how she had previously presented herself and how she influenced your life.  New evidence suggests that this influence has been deceptive and that as a result she isn't trustworthy.  It's not wrong to trust your gut when presented with new information.  This woman sounds toxic, narcissistic, and extremely resentful of you.  Why would you want to surround yourself with someone who seems to hate you so much and has obviously taught the people in her life to disregard you in the same way?\n\nThis isn't about a man.  This is about a woman who claimed to be your friend and wasn't.  She isn't.  She will never be.\n\nIt's okay to stop being her friend when she was never yours.", "She wouldn't feel guilty about taking any opportunities away from you.... Just some food for thought", "Actually, she lied to you once for her benefit.  Not a small, superficial lie, but a gigantic one in the context of your life at that point in time. How do you ***know*** this is really a career opportunity?  At this point, you cannot distinguish lies from the truth from her.\n\nMaybe she just wants a 3-month vacation from her responsibilities.\n\nIf she leaves that facebook post up, I suggest you respond to it and tell everyone the lie she told for her own benefit.

Wow, she has some kind of gall when it's literally you who has realized you can't trust HER!\n\nNTA\n\nPeople sometimes marry their hs relationship - she could have interfered with the course of your life - with a self-serving lie.\n\nThis would be a friendship dealbreaker for me.", "It's you who found out she betrayed you!

Emily is not your friend. She has been manipulating you and treating you like crap.\n\nThe only reason she is mad is because she doesn\u2019t have free child care now. It is probably best you block her and go no contact with her family, yes it will suck since you are close with her kid, but do you really think she will let you around her kid if you are no longer making her life easier? \n\nHer and her husband can pay for child care. \n\nGo out with Liam because it seems you two are into each other. He is only her ex because she betrayed you.", "So practically yesterday and she pretends like it was 20 years ago and she is a completely different person now.

We're all rooting for you!! NTA Emily is not your friend, it's time you had some distance from her.

Cut her completely off, spend some time getting to know him again.  You both deserve it.", "Go make candy and make your own memories. You both are victims of her lying, she used both of you. Losing a friend is hard but I hope all these comments are opening your eyes. It\u2019s hard to see when you are in the situation.

But I teach high school and middle school and teenagers are egoistical AH and most of them do grow out of it. Perhaps it was a teenage mistake. Perhaps it is a character trait. We only know a tiny snippet of a decades long friendship. If this really was the only issue in those decades, I stand by what I said. Why is it that everyone in AITA always wants people to break up friendships and relationships and get people divorced over single instances? We only ever get one side of the story and know nothing else about either of the parties involved.", "Did Liam say he would have asked you out if not for Emily's interference?  I don't know, when 2 shy teens are interested in each other, a lot of times, nothing happens because neither will make the first move.  I agree with Away\\_Refuse8493 about the dynamics of your relationship with Emily.  I understand you are upset with how two-faced she was in high school but you already knew she pursued the one guy you liked in high school and dated him knowing how that made you feel.  So now you know the details.  What's really changed?  The outcome was the same.  \n\nIf you love Emily's daughter (you are her godmother), then help take care of her for her sake, not Emily's.  The good thing is Emily won't be around which will give you plenty of time to consider whether or not you want to continue this friendship.", "And accusing her of doing something wrong talking to Liam. Wow", "This\u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206Needs to be upvoted!", "The DARVO is strong within Emily.", "Well like I said, I can only speculate what would have happened. When we talked (while being drunk) somehow we ended up discussing actors and actresses and he commented about some of them being pretty and I said \u201csounds like you have a type\u201d, he said \u201cyeah, it you\u201d, I teased him \u201coh, that\u2019s why you dated Emily\u201d and he said \u201cwell you weren\u2019t really an option, were you?\u201d. Then I was shocked, asked him what did he mean and he told me about the gay thing. Then I cried a bit (well I was drunk), we both got mad and ended up talking about how much better the high school would have been if we got together. Then he said if he could go back in time he would change it all, but we only have present time so we can only change it now but\u2026 I just don\u2019t know what would have happened. In later years of high school after I started attending gym and got better sense of style I became much more self confident but\u2026 I just can\u2019t know, can I?\n\nMy pointed out fantasy is a one thing, but the other thing is betrayal. \n\nI am close with Emily\u2019s daughter and her husband, this is why I feel so bad for changing my mind. But on the other hand I feel Emily will just give up on the research and it makes me so sad for her too, since she fought so hard for archiving this dream. I just wish I got some closure and now I would feel weird about backtracking. I talked with Emily\u2019s husband some more and he said Emily is very sorry but she is also bit stubborn and hurt about me talking with Liam, because she feels it\u2019s be who betrayed her. So he thinks it\u2019s best if I apologize for my part first and then we can reconcile. He said it\u2019s weak of me to even talk about love life with Emily\u2019s ex and I\u2019m egoistic if I can\u2019t see her side in it. I do feel guilty but I also don\u2019t want to be the first one who reached out, because I\u2019m just so deeply mad at her. And so sad about it all.", "And Emily can find her own childcare now.", "[removed]", "She is a user and a manipulator and don\u2019t let yourself be taken advantage of by her.", "Exactly - it's the behavior of a person who thinks you exist to serve their whims, and cannot imagine a world where you won't do what they say.", "Please reconsider your friendship with Emily and her husband. His comments are manipulative and only trying to get you to reconsider providing them with free childcare. There isn\u2019t a rational person out there who thinks YOU should be the one apologizing.", "Oh, that is some ridiculous bull. Emily worked by pushing other people down and climbing up on their backs.\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for. She should be groveling on her knees to you. \n\nAny chance you and Liam can give it a go?", "NTA! \n\nIt makes so much sense how Emily and her husband got together. They are both just as selfish and egotistical as eachother. \n\nPlease for your own sanity stay FAR AWAY from these people. You\u2019re lucky you have found out just how little they value you as a person and just how much they use you and manipulate you. This is disgusting behaviour from that family.", "Yo, this is bat shit. Lol. She is married with a kid and a whole family. Why does she care about an ex? If she's really moved on and feels bad about being manipulative and this being iN hIghScHOol, then she should apologize and be happy for you. A good friend can set aside her own ego and be happy for others. \n\nAlso isn't it funny how this went from her doing something wrong to you now betraying her by seeing Liam? This is gaslighting. Rather than owning up to what she did, so you can both work on rebuilding trust, she's turned this around on you. Where's your apology? \n\nAlso her husband calling you egotistical? YOU should apologize? I no longer feel bad for him. Again, the girl with an entire family hanging onto an ex from high school? It's immature. They both seem like they deserve each other.\n\nNo one talks about friendships ending and how hurtful that can be. It's honestly just like relationships. Someone you have loved and been so close to just suddenly being out of your life sucks. However, just because it's always been there doesn't mean that it's good for you. I'd decide if this friendship gives you more than it takes. It's OK to walk away from situations that no longer serve you.", ">. He said it\u2019s weak of me to even talk about love life with Emily\u2019s ex and I\u2019m egoistic if I can\u2019t see her side in it. I do feel guilty\n\nNTA OP.  I downvoted your comment because of the above statement.  Do you get that Emily only dated Liam because she didn't want you to date him?  She wanted her friend (you) on call whenever she wanted and if you dated, then you wouldn't be at her beck and call.  By her dating Liam, she was assuring that you wouldn't break the Bestfriend code of not dating an Ex.  I also downvoted you because you have nothing to feel guilty for.  They still have time to arrange something.  **YOU** need the time to reflect on your friendship and her betrayal.  She and her husband are manipulating you and I can guarantee, as soon as your friend comes back from job assignment, she and husband will ghost you.", "You are NTA \n\nmaybe you would not have dated, maybe you could have dated. The problem is that Emily took that chance away by lying and being manipulative. Even though you were in high school, Emily would have known that she was crossing a line.  This is more about the lying and betrayal than \u201cstealing\u201d some crush.\n\nBe honest with yourself, is this likely to be something you can forgive and put behind you?  You alone can decide if your friendship is worth saving.  If you can\u2019t get past this, then it\u2019s best to cut this quickly and be done .  If you think there is a chance to save the friendship, it doesn\u2019t mean you are not due a sincere apology and a lot of making up.  Emily has to realise she treated you terribly and actually be sorry.\n\nLastly, maybe you can start a relationship with Liam but you would be wise to put that off until you have dealt with the issues with Emily, otherwise there will always be some bad history between you.", "that's what I thought", "I\u2019m Emily. But not this Emily. \ud83d\ude09\n\nOP, you are NTA. Emily is. I\u2019ve had friends like this (and been the painfully shy girl who stayed in the friend zone with all her crushes and found out later that that could have been different), you don\u2019t need them. Date Liam.", "Yup, the fb post was an attempt to get OP to fold to social pressure and to keep control the narrative. I bet this wasn't the only time this false friend has sabotaged OP's life. Working that hard to be the center of attention is just ugly.", "He says it\u2019s bit of betrayal for meeting Emily\u2019s ex behind her back and I do feel bad but at the same time I didn\u2019t plan it, it just happened.  But also I feel like I\u2019m taking Emily\u2019s dreams away and while I\u2019m so mad at her I still have so much love for her, I\u2019m just very hurt since she was the last person from who I expected such a backstabbing", "I mean, I just feel bad in general so the feeling of guilt comes easy. Liam and I have been taking, he wants to take me on a date but I told him I need a time to think it through. On one hand I really want it but on the other I can just imagine how scrutinized I will get for dating my friend\u2019s ex. It\u2019s lose-lose situation I\u2019m afraid. But Liam is very supportive and actually lets me vent about this whole situation like no one else.", "There is absolutely nothing \u201ccreepy and pathetic\u201d about OP\u2019s behavior.  She had a crush on someone.  While it seems some people were born adults and never had a teenage crush, it\u2019s not creepy and pathetic to have one.  Instead, it\u2019s perfectly normal.  \n\nMoreover, while she had this crush, she didn\u2019t act on it while her supposed friend friend dated her crush.  That also isn\u2019t \u201ccreepy and pathetic.\u201d  Instead, that is exemplary behavior.  Unlike her supposed friend, OP remained loyal and true.  \n\nIt\u2019s also perfectly normal to realize that someone who you always thought was a close friend really isn\u2019t when you discover, that when you confide in them that you have a crush on someone, they lied to the object of your crush about your sexual orientation in order to prevent you from having a romantic relationship and starting one themself. \n\nTo me, that behavior indicates that the person who you mistakenly thought was a friend had been mistreating and manipulating you for her own benefit.  That alone is enough to end the relationship over.  In sum, there is nothing creepy and pathetic about OP.", ">It\u2019s also perfectly normal to realize that someone who you always thought was a close friend really isn\u2019t when you discover, that when you confide in them that you have a crush on someone, they lied to the object of your crush about your sexual orientation in order to prevent you from having a romantic relationship and starting one themself.\n\nThis is where we disagree.  That version of reality makes no sense.\n\nMost people have a \"crush\" but this is an unrequited obsession, and it is not helpful for OP to be upset about her \"missed chance\" and not healthy for OP to have this much emotion about it. (This is how incel's think - OP may be a lady incel, idk).\n\nPeople also regularly confess high school crushes in their 20s. This Liam scenario is not weird, but it's not anchored in reality.  At the end of the day, he dated Emily. Emily probably dumped him. Someone else probably dumped him. No one knows what is going on w/ Liam, right now.\n\nOP & Emily should not be friends. Emily is probably the one who should've ended it b/c it is difficult to be best friends w/ someone obsessed with your bf.  \n\nI'm not sure how old you are, or if you've ever been in a relationship, but no one cares about (nor should care about) a teenage crush.", "You are making up many things in order to portray OP in a bad light.  Really, it\u2019s you who looks bad."]}
