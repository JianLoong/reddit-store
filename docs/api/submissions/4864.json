I haven't dated since me and her mother split up 17 years ago. \n\nTo still live with me and be financially supported by me at the age of 20 Isabella has to follow a number of rules. I know this sounds harsh but most kids move out at 18 I know I certainly did and young adults her age are usually at university by now but Isabella is very resistant to move out. She has a job but I've limited her to only working 3 days a week. If she wants to work more hours she can move out and pay rent in her own place. I don't make her pay rent or pay for groceries but she must help around tje house when she's not working. I used to hire a cleaner for when I was at work and Isabella was at school and the cleaner would come twice a week but since Isabella left school I require her to replace the tasks of the cleaner instead of just sitting around. She's not allowed to drink under my roof or be in my home drunk or hungover as her mother had alcohol problems and she's not allowed boys over. If she disagrees with or disobeys any of these rules she's very welcome to move out.\n\nDespite these rules I have for my daughter we get on very well. Up until recently. Isabella has been pushing against the rules, not completing chores and I found some bottles of beer under her bed which was the final straw. I asked her to please leave and she shouted at me, I thought she might be drunk and, as that is a trigger for me, I left the room. The next day I firmly reminded her again no alcohol in the house. She told me all her friends drink and that I was babying her and I said that wasn't the reason and I just didn't want to and she had to trust me. She told me that me being closed off and secretive about my reasons for things was ruining our relationship and she never wanted to talk to me again. I told her she couldn't give me the silent treatment in my own house and I gave her \u00a3200 and let her pack her bags and sent her on her way. Not caring where she went because she is 20 and old enough to know better.\n\nIt's been 5 days since Isabella left and we haven't spoken even once. I miss her and it is very reminiscent of when isabellas mother left me, in a drunken rage. And I'm starting to thing I may be an asshole for kicking my daughter out like that.

You\u2019ve created a toxic environment.", "YTA. You've basically forced her to stay with you by limiting the amount of days she can work. When you moved out 27 years ago it was easy for anyone with a full time job to support themselves with little prior money, today that is basically impossible without a university degree/high paying job and huge amount of savings to get started. By limiting the amount of days she can work you trapped her in a home where she is treated like a child when she is a grown women. You have not taught her how to be an adult, you haven't taught her how to safely handle alcohol or have safe consensual relationships with an adult to fall back on for help, you've left her alone to figure that all out with no where to go to for help. If you treated her mother anything like this then it's no wonder she ran.\n\nWhat you've just done now is kick her onto the streets with no where to go. That never ever should have been a potential consequence at this age. Maybe if she was on hard drugs or refusing to work this would be fair, but this was horific.

University, whilst right for some, comes with a crippling debt and no guarantee of better job expectations. In addition, an awful lot of these young adults require parental support because of the shitty higher education model in the UK. \n\n>She has a job but I've limited her to only working 3 days a week.\n\n>I require her to replace the tasks of the cleaner instead of just sitting around.\n\nYou're delusional if you think this is a fair way to treat her. It's incredibly controlling. She's your daughter not your slave. This goes far beyond parental \"my house, my rules\" territory. \n\n>Not caring where she went because she is 20 and old enough to know better.\n\nI hope she's found someone more mature to stay with as this is childish. No wonder she's not contacted you. You can't suddenly turn on the worried parent act because she's finally stood up for herself. \n\n>I miss her and it is very reminiscent of when isabellas mother left me, in a drunken rage.\n\nNo, you miss your live-in cleaner. You didn't try to understand her position in the slightest and are dumping her mother's sins on her unfairly and unjustifiably. \n\nIf you actually want a relationship with your daughter try reaching out yourself, but don't be surprised if she doesn't respond.

You state that she could work more when she moves out but before that happens she needs to be able to save up AT LEAST enough for first, last and security deposit not to mention savings for groceries, utilities and future rent so she doesn\u2019t screw herself for the first few months.

It\u2019s fair for kids to have to contribute, yes, but you need to keep the goal in mind which is preparing her to lead a life on her own.

You wonder why you're financially supporting her? because YOU WONT LET HER WORK! if she works 8 hours at $15/hour thats 360 before tax each week, you were greatly hindering her ability to save up. also YTA because you were trying to control every aspect of her life it sounds like...", "Yta please go to therapy you have some major control issues. You do realize she's not her mother right? The way you treat her and these rules you are trying to keep her dependent on you and you clearly have some abandonment issues. Also she is 20 why were you checking under her bed?", "YTA, definitely you are the problem in the storie. She's just 20  , this ideia of moving out whit only 18 is a fantasy created by people with no notion of real life. It's 2022, inflation and crisis growing rapidly, and a part time job doesn't pay shit.\nSpecially without a notice ahead of time or growing her teaching financial planning to prepare her to move", "So wait, you make it so your daughter can\u2019t work enough to even move out, you set silly rules, you use her as a maid, you don\u2019t want her to drink because her mom had alcohol issues but how would she know that\u2019s the reason when you don\u2019t talk about her mom? You\u2019ve given her a rule that, to her, doesn\u2019t make any sense and your excuse is \u201cbecause I said so\u201d that works for 5 year olds, not 20 year olds. You kinda suck. \n\nYTA", "YTA.  OMG, where to begin. You tell her she can't work outside the house, because you want her to be a slave in your own house.  No, that's not the words you used.  But you are limiting her hours at work so she can be your maid, because you thought it would be convenient to fire the maid.  WTF", "YTA I bet when you were \u201callowed\u201d to work three days a week on her salary you wouldn\u2019t be able to move out. You sound very controlling. Your way or high way.", "YTA - You kicked your daughter out on the spot, not even leaving her a couple weeks to find a place, because she broke a rule. Breaking a rule is not cool but she wasn't a danger to herself or anyone, she didn't break anything... I get that you're traumatized but if you do love her, explain to her why you are the way you are. She can hear it. Then if you wanted her to move out, the right way was to help her find a place. You basically pushed her into the deep end of the pool before she learned to swim.", "INFO: why don't you let her work more than 3 days a week? I can understand some (not all) of your rules, but you should have an honest conversation with her about them. She's an adult woman now, she won't accept \"Because I told you so\" as an answer.", "YTA- First, who gives you the right to limit someone\u2019s job when you want to them to move out? Please make it make sense, the dumbest rule I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cHey I want you to move out so work less hours and make less money so you can fully support yourself when you move out\u201d \n\nSecondly, hiding bottles in her room? I\u2019m sure being a parent is hard, but why not placing your trauma aside and stepping up as a father and talking to her about what\u2019s making her feel this way. Don\u2019t let history repeat itself, sounds like you\u2019re the problem.", "YTA. You only let her work 3 days a week which means she likely has little to no savings. The cost of living crisis in the UK (assuming you\u2019re from there since you used the \u00a3 symbol) is brutal right now. Housing is ridiculously expensive. In the EU, the average age a child leaves their parents house is now over 26. It\u2019s not like previous times when an 18 year old could get a union job with a living wage. \n\nNevermind your silly rules about alcohol and boys. You lost your ex and now you\u2019ve likely lost your daughter. I can see why your ex left in a drunken rage.", "YTA. \n\nIt feels like emotional incest in a sense. You never dated but you kept your daughter controlled and dependent so she could never leave you. But when you were unhappy with her you tossed her out like trash.", "YTA - Less and less people are moving out at 18. And how the hell is she supposed to save up to move out if you limit her working.", "YTA.\n\nFirst off, these days most kids DON'T move out at 18. It's insanely expensive out there. This whole only working 3 days a week thing is bas\\*\\*t insane. Instead she has to clean the house? This is madness and ultra controlling. \n\nThis is nothing like when her mother left you \"in a drunken rage\", unless you were super controlling of her as well. You kicked your daughter out because she had had enough of your controlling ways and the fact that you were keeping her from being able to have any sort of normal, adult life. I wouldn't come back if I were her.", "YTA. \n\nMost kids *don\u2019t* move out at 18 nowadays.  \nAnd it sounds like because of your 17+ year old insecurities, you\u2019re sabotaging every chance your daughter has at *becoming* independent. \n\nI can see why she left \u201cin a drunken rage\u201d just like her mother\u2026", "YTA im 21f straight of uni and finding a job that pays enough to move out is really difficult. You need experience for the career jobs but you can't get experience cos no one will hire someone without experience. Now how is your daughter supposed to move out when youre restricting her to part time? I'm working 35 hours a week which is considered full time in the UK and im not earning enough to move out. Youre setting your daughter up for failure and seem to want her to be miserable.", "You sound controlling. YTA. Most people DO NOT move out when they turn 18, and the fact you don't see this shows how out of touch with reality you are.", "YTA\n\nIf only for restricting your daughter's ability to earn money to therefore move out. Why can they only work 3 days a week? That is basically hamstring them from ever getting a real career and being able to earn money. You can't have a live-in housekeeper and a functional human adult. You need to choose one and let them go", "What is it with ppl insisting their kids move out basically condemning them to debt & poverty!??? These ppl are just so out of tune with what's going on in reality when it comes to wages & rent. Obviously a son or daughter needs to move out eventually,  but give them a chance to save up money, or get a degree without having to work two/three jobs. You're going to work your whole life anyway, this is a time in your life when you should be focused on studying and social skills.\n\nYTA OP, you created those situation in the first play by not allowing her to work. Go out and look at rent & wages, do the maths yourself", "YTA. Ppl don\u2019t just move out at 18 now days, especially with the disruption of the virus. It\u2019s wrong that you are restricting how much she can work. Of course she should help you out, but that doesn\u2019t mean she should be your live in maid. An alternative would be her to pay rent of some kind to you and you treat her more like a roommate, rather than someone you impose fairly strict restrictions on. She is not a child, but you are treating her like one, potentially hindering her ability to grow up. It may be good for her to get away from you because that living situation sounds awful", "Control freak!!!!!", "YTA. Mr Puppet Master here. Your relationship isn't good. You keeping secrets isn't good. You justify it by, \"We don't speak about her.\" Then when you couldn't have it your way with your strict, overbearing rules, you pushed your own child away. As a dad of 3, I could NEVER.", "\u201cShe has a job but I've limited her to only working 3 days a week. If she wants to work more hours she can move out and pay rent in her own place.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re demonstrating cruel leverage over your daughter here.

She can\u2019t even have her own life without you forcing her into financial jeopardy. YTA.", "YTA - You restricted her work hours therefore financially controlling her to some degree with is ABUSE. If she was your partner it would be considered domestic violence. You then expect her \u2018replace the tasks of a cleaner\u2019 which cost money yet you have the view she should do this for no money or recognition. Doubt you\u2019d be this way if you had a son.

I hope she is OK.", "She could work and save and get excited to move out and buy her own things and even help pay for a cleaner but he chooses to use her like a house slave?? Mind blown. \n\nRules are fine. Manipulation is not. YTA OP.", "What???? Are you ok?", "You just perfectly explained what I couldn\u2019t in my response. This is exactly what he was doing.", "Imagine if he didn\u2019t love her\u2026.", "Indeed she can legally drink at 18 in the UK. I understand her mother had an issue with alcohol but his reluctance in allowing her freedoms (like working full time, drinking with her friends having a boyfriend SHES AN ADULT) is going to make her to want to do it more.

She makes less than \u00a3400 a week. Can YOU survive off of that? How is she ever supposed to move out? Almost like you don\u2019t want her to move out, and know she CAN\u2019T on that amount.", "No. She is financially crippled because you stopped her from having a full time job. She has no experience because YOU didn't let her have it.", "That makes her your live in maid 4 days a week. You don't see how inappropriate that is?", "You do realise that living expenses don\u2019t differ depending on age? Saying \u00a313 is great for her age doesn\u2019t help. \n\nYou limit how much she can work and now you treat her like a cleaner for the other hours she has. \n\nI am so shocked at your attitude, it\u2019s awful.", "Oh you\u2019re giving her time to be your maid?

Probably more like \u00a31050 after tax. Living rent free, that's a good wage, but to move out she would be looking at anything from \u00a3500 to \u00a3900 a month to rent a room in a house share, depending on where you live. That makes it very difficult and frankly very scary for a 20yo to move out. \n\nYOU HAVE STOPPED HER FROM EARNING MORE MONEY SO SHE CAN BE YOUR MAID. \n\nIt sounds like you have lasting trauma from your ex leaving and therefore you have decided to make it very hard for your daughter to be independent, and you are trying to keep her your baby for as long as possible.

The wife left because she had addiction problems and the dad was protecting his child. OP is definitely TA here but I don't think their relationship is irredeemable.
