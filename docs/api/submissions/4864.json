I haven't dated since me and her mother split up 17 years ago. \n\nTo still live with me and be financially supported by me at the age of 20 Isabella has to follow a number of rules. I know this sounds harsh but most kids move out at 18 I know I certainly did and young adults her age are usually at university by now but Isabella is very resistant to move out. She has a job but I've limited her to only working 3 days a week. If she wants to work more hours she can move out and pay rent in her own place. I don't make her pay rent or pay for groceries but she must help around tje house when she's not working. I used to hire a cleaner for when I was at work and Isabella was at school and the cleaner would come twice a week but since Isabella left school I require her to replace the tasks of the cleaner instead of just sitting around. She's not allowed to drink under my roof or be in my home drunk or hungover as her mother had alcohol problems and she's not allowed boys over. If she disagrees with or disobeys any of these rules she's very welcome to move out.\n\nDespite these rules I have for my daughter we get on very well. Up until recently. Isabella has been pushing against the rules, not completing chores and I found some bottles of beer under her bed which was the final straw. I asked her to please leave and she shouted at me, I thought she might be drunk and, as that is a trigger for me, I left the room. The next day I firmly reminded her again no alcohol in the house. She told me all her friends drink and that I was babying her and I said that wasn't the reason and I just didn't want to and she had to trust me. She told me that me being closed off and secretive about my reasons for things was ruining our relationship and she never wanted to talk to me again. I told her she couldn't give me the silent treatment in my own house and I gave her \u00a3200 and let her pack her bags and sent her on her way. Not caring where she went because she is 20 and old enough to know better.\n\nIt's been 5 days since Isabella left and we haven't spoken even once. I miss her and it is very reminiscent of when isabellas mother left me, in a drunken rage. And I'm starting to thing I may be an asshole for kicking my daughter out like that.

You\u2019ve created a toxic environment.", "YTA. You've basically forced her to stay with you by limiting the amount of days she can work. When you moved out 27 years ago it was easy for anyone with a full time job to support themselves with little prior money, today that is basically impossible without a university degree/high paying job and huge amount of savings to get started. By limiting the amount of days she can work you trapped her in a home where she is treated like a child when she is a grown women. You have not taught her how to be an adult, you haven't taught her how to safely handle alcohol or have safe consensual relationships with an adult to fall back on for help, you've left her alone to figure that all out with no where to go to for help. If you treated her mother anything like this then it's no wonder she ran.\n\nWhat you've just done now is kick her onto the streets with no where to go. That never ever should have been a potential consequence at this age. Maybe if she was on hard drugs or refusing to work this would be fair, but this was horific.

University, whilst right for some, comes with a crippling debt and no guarantee of better job expectations. In addition, an awful lot of these young adults require parental support because of the shitty higher education model in the UK. \n\n>She has a job but I've limited her to only working 3 days a week.\n\n>I require her to replace the tasks of the cleaner instead of just sitting around.\n\nYou're delusional if you think this is a fair way to treat her. It's incredibly controlling. She's your daughter not your slave. This goes far beyond parental \"my house, my rules\" territory. \n\n>Not caring where she went because she is 20 and old enough to know better.\n\nI hope she's found someone more mature to stay with as this is childish. No wonder she's not contacted you. You can't suddenly turn on the worried parent act because she's finally stood up for herself. \n\n>I miss her and it is very reminiscent of when isabellas mother left me, in a drunken rage.\n\nNo, you miss your live-in cleaner. You didn't try to understand her position in the slightest and are dumping her mother's sins on her unfairly and unjustifiably. \n\nIf you actually want a relationship with your daughter try reaching out yourself, but don't be surprised if she doesn't respond.

You denied her basic choices in what she does it doesn't want to do, essentially denying her her place as an adult. \n Today very very few people move out at 18 due to the ridiculous cost of living, they simply can't afford to and have any quality of life.

As everyone except you well knows, that\u2019s not possible anymore. Rent prices are through the roof and you\u2019re only allowing her to work part time so she can provide you unpaid labour. You state that she could work more when she moves out but before that happens she needs to be able to save up AT LEAST enough for first, last and security deposit not to mention savings for groceries, utilities and future rent so she doesn\u2019t screw herself for the first few months.

Pretty messed up to do that to your own daughter. Also no drinking or boys? That's some hectic isolation. She is an adult, this is borderline abuse. You're treating her terribly due to your own inability to recover from whatever trauma you've experienced which you've made pretty obvious in this post or yours.\n\nAlso, back in your day, you could buy a house working from a shitty job, so yea, moving out at 18 was the norm, but the world has changed.

It\u2019s fair for kids to have to contribute, yes, but you need to keep the goal in mind which is preparing her to lead a life on her own.

Clean up and help out? Sure that's reasonable. But she shouldn't be doing more than her share. Finally, you are creating a horrible environment for a young person in regards to alcohol.

Other than that also what is the logic of forcing your 20-year-old daughter to only be able to work three days a week?

I assume when you were her age, you weren't so limited in your work, so you had plenty of opportunity to live on your own, attend university if you chose, etc. etc. Additionally, the strict rule about her working any longer than that being \"she needs to move out\" seems to indicate that she'd be dropped just as quickly as you've done here.\n\nIn regards to the current situation, your daughter is of legal drinking age, and should be allowed to explore this. Yes, you're entitled to keeping alcohol out of your home, or even ensuring you don't have to witness drunk behavior. Both are fine boundaries to have--however, from what you've said, you have no alternative in allowing her to explore who she is as an adult. Why couldn't she just be given the option to stay with a friend if she wanted to have a drinking night? Instead of allowing the two of you to build an adult relationship based on mutual trust, you've forced her into a position where if she wants to explore who she is, she has to keep it a secret from you for fear of being left homeless. Which, by the way, you confirmed was the case by doing just that.\n\nAdditionally, you've seemed to indicate that your daughter doesn't even know that this is a trigger for you, and seems to have little to no context as to the circumstances of her mother abandoning the both of you. So not only are you incredibly controlling to the point of suffocating, she doesn't even know WHY you're like this.\n\nAll that being said, I'm going to say it'll be near impossible for your relationship to recover from this. Based on the reports of other folks in the UK, not only did you shove your daughter onto the streets with barely enough money to get by, you did so in the middle of horrid weather conditions. \n\nYou basically told your daughter that it was more important for her to listen to your strict rules than it was for her to survive.

I totally get that you don't want to her also to have alcohol problems, but by just blanket banning her from having any alcohol and by being so rigid about it, you're not teaching her any responsibilities.

I think it would have been better to tell her that you want her to move out and that is non-negotiable, then work out an agreement that details how the process is going to go.\n\nThen some of the rules you made are not so OK with me. I do not think limiting her to work 3 days a week is good: if she's going to move out she needs to have a full-time job, and the more money a she earns the quicker she can move out. I know you don't make her participate financially in exchange, but that is imo a bad move. Let her work and pay you rent, you are adult roomates now. The whole point is that she moves out, make it a situation that would be as close as possible for her to actually living independently, then it is not going to be such a stretch to actually do it, especially since there is no drinking at your place and she wants that. In the same, your rule about housekeeping is not good imo: it's a job, since she is replacing the housekeeper. But she has no choice in that, apparently. I am not comfortable with that, let her work where she wants (you want her to move out, be independent,no?), and keep your housekeeper...unless she wants this of course. That she does chores as you do is logical, she lives there, but the professional housekeeping issue is a problem (does she pay for half the housekeeper when it's your choice? These things need to be discussed and agreed upon, like adults).\n\nNow she's not respecting your rules and you guys fought - leading you chucking her out without notice, very little money, a 3-days/week job that is not able to cover any kind of rent. So what's she going to do now? crash at friends and party, and no safety net because her only parent is \"dead to her\", most likely.\n\nThis strengthens me in my opinion that you should have gone about it another way which includes discussions and agreements. Why does she not want to move out?
