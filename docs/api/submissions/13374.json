There's people in this world who assume that if you're speaking in a foreign language or even a coded language that you're doing it because you're talking about them. Some of these people get so offended that they can't understand what you're saying that you must be doing it on purpose specifically to talk about them that they sometimes resort to violence. In this case they resorted to telling school officials. For the school it's a he-said he-said situation. They don't know what you said but are assuming the other student wouldn't be lying. I don't know how you would prove you aren't talking about him unfortunately. I understand the importance and comfort of talking to your friend in your first language and you shouldn't be restricted to where you can speak but do be aware there are AH and be careful if your safety is in danger.\n\nEdit: As others have said get your parents involved.", "NTA - I think there are three conflicting issues here which you should raise with a teacher and admin:\n\n1. That you do have a right to speak your home language and should not be shamed for this or prevented from speaking your language\n2. That the class teacher, presumably not speaking Bahasa, can't understand what you are saying and therefore finds it difficult to manage the class and deal with these bullying complaints\n3. That you feel Ace is bullying you by making false accusations and making it so you can't speak your own home language at school.\n\nWhere there is harassment, the teacher is likely to have to ask you to speak in English because it's the only way for them to ensure there is no harassment (both to keep from escalating issues at school and to protect you from false accusations). It might be that you will need to be speaking English during class time and Indonesian during the break times as you like - just do it away from Ace. Do be mindful as well that when you are speaking Indonesian, you are cutting out everyone else - including your other classmates. There will often be times when academic discussion is required to be in English for learning purposes.\n\nYou could also talk to the teacher about wanting to be able to speak your home language and ask the teacher what kind of things need to be put in place for you to be able to do that. I think you'll find they can't ban you completely (looks super racist because... it is...) so you should make sure they give you clear guidelines (in writing) so you can't get in trouble for doing it.\n\nYou should also ask to have it formally recorded that you not be placed with or near Ace, and to have your explanation of these interactions recorded formally. I don't think you should apologise - you should just make it very clear and request that it is formally noted that you did not in fact mention them in any way and that just because Ace is accusing you of it does not mean it actually happened that way. Do be mindful of any Indonesian that could be misleading and sound like Ace's name. Be aware too that your comment, \"Both my friend and I have never name-dropped them in any conversations because we\u2019re not that stupid to do it with them in the same vicinity as us,\" clearly implies a level of dislike - not unwarranted- so going forward, know that that is likely clear to all parties that you are on bad terms. \n\nAt the same time - if Ace doesn't speak Indonesian, they clearly cannot have a clue what you were talking about. This should be pointed out too! Do you have any witnesses? Things for stuff like body language, eye contact, tone of voice - if people can attest you weren't looking at Ace, or speaking in a mean tone, or pointing and so on then how would Ace know you were talking about them, given they can't speak the language? You can certainly express concern about this false accusation being racially motivated given the clear outcome seems to be to ban you from speaking your home language...", "NTA and I'd make a complaint of xenophobic harassment and make clear you'd be willing to make the school look bad if they take his side", "NTA and you could probably sue the school for this", "NTA\nYou are doing nothing wrong.

You are NTA", "NTA. \n\nI would also tell your school administration that banning someone from speaking their language was one of the tactics that was ruled by the UN to be a Genocide in the Residential School system, and that if they try to restrict your use of your own language, you have every right to file a human rights complaint against the school.", "NTA.

It also doesn't mean this person can control which language you speak.\n\nI know in my high school they did ask some students to be careful of words in their first languages that sounded very similar to slurs in English as that was creating a lot of tension between groups of students, but no one was told to quit speaking their own language.\n\nThe students were told to be very careful of anything that sounded like the N word with a hard R and we had a brief lesson in every English class about false cognates, or words that sound the same while meaning different things in their own languages.\n\nBecause you can't expect people to not react to slurs they think are aimed at themselves even if the rest of the conversation isn't one they can understand, but you also can't expect people to change their entire language just to accommodate someone they have no interest in talking to, it's a delicate situation.\n\nI do think the situation possibly could have been resolved by talking more with Ace when the first accusations were made to find out *why* they are so certain you and your friend were talking about them.", "NTA, unless they know what you are saying, you are doing nothing wrong.

The other language I speak is relatively common, but I still get looks of I speak it in school or in public. Tell a teacher about this. Ace is Racist, plain and simple. Do not allow them to walk over you like this.\n\nIt seems you didn\u2019t do anything to Ace to cause this insecurity and hatred. Ace doesn\u2019t understand Indonesian, how could they know you are talking about them? You might not be able to do this, but talk to the principal about your side of the story.\n\nMake sure you don\u2019t show this post, though. They might try and use that to make you the villain.", "NTA.. God I miss the good ole days of the 90s. Talking trash? Meet me by the bike rack and we'll settle it. Done and over.", "So imo, NTA, for speaking your language, and the school/teacher shouldn\u2019t be telling you not to speak it.  However, I do think it\u2019s worth saying in general, that when being around others who don\u2019t speak the same language as you, especially in cases of where you might have a bad relationship or even possibly neutral relationship, its very easy for people to assume the worst and think that you\u2019re talking poorly about them, because they can\u2019t understand you.  So while you\u2019re not in the wrong, I do think it would be beneficial to be cognizant that others would feel on edge from you speaking in another language around them.  That being said, again you\u2019re not at fault.  If Ace had an issue with you, he should have directly confronted you instead of mistakenly insinuating to the teacher that you insulted him.", "Also, make sure you repeatedly ask if you are being banned from speaking your native language.

California Constitution Article 1 Section 2 (a) is also a free speech line, but it specifies an additional \"being responsible for the abuse of this right.\" The school will probably try to use this line, and bringing a court case up to a level that can override that would be prohibitively expensive. They need to be proactive so as to be able to prove that the next time they get called out for this they can prove that they weren't doing what the antagonist claims.", "No one is entitled to op\u2019s conversations unless they concern them.

I don\u2019t really think you owe him an apology.  He could\u2019ve handled the whole thing better at the beginning.  Sadly, some people do switch to another language to talk badly about others.  It happens all the time and often backfires spectacularly on the individuals.  So I can understand why Ace is a bit paranoid and using it as an excuse to cause trouble. I think it\u2019s awful that the school is reacting the way they are, but I am also not surprised.  Banning you from having a conversation in another language is ridiculous. Perhaps you should let the administration know that if you are expected to only speak in English on the school grounds, then that should apply to everyone else at school. They might find it rather difficult to teach foreign language classes under those circumstances.", "NTA\n\nTo top that off, Ace has no idea what you said and you can be sure they can't repeat anything you said either even if they didn't understand just knowing a general structure of the words and phonetics would be beyond them. \n\nWatch them squirm when asked to repeat something you said. Watch them squirm when you ask them to translate. And again when you ask why you're being singled out and not the other speaking the language, why just you and not both of you? \n\nAsk the principal what \"making everyone uncomfortable\" means, get him to explain it, exactly, in detail, what the issue is, what speaking Indonesian is an issue, how others are uncomfortable by it. \n\nNot everyone needs to be included in every conversation and it's not relevant to them either. So this boils down to racism, censoring your speech and heritage coz of their racism and discomfort. \n\nThe \"heard their name dropped\" is their attempt only to mask the issue. There is no rule against speaking anything other than English, and Ace nor anyone else has evidence of you saying anything wrong either. \n\nSo why are you being pulled in front of the head of the school, the authority in the school to be told what you cannot do? Why is Ace allowed to weaponize the administration against you on unfounded accusations. So far as I can tell, the school just accepted what Ace said as truth with no investigation as to whether anything wrong did happen to begin with. \n\nSo you're being bullied by Ace directly as they ostracized you from your peers over this and indirectly through the school admins by enforcing Aces will over you. \n\n1. Get your guardians involved.\n\n2. Write all this down, every good question in this thread from everyone to put to the administration in a letter, or bring it along to read to the principal or admins who are enforcing this on you.\n\nRead it to them, wait for their response at each question. Don't accept the meeting to be finished with out 2 thing's, 1. They hear every question you have and 2. They give you in advance a commitment to investigate this matter with consequences for Ace for maliciously reporting you set out ahead of the investigation or for your freedoms to be restored without retaliation or prejudice. \n\n3. It may be good to request Aces parents be pulled in too, either they are unaware or are the root of the problem. But either way, no parent likes to be pulled in and bothers by their children's poor behaviours in school and being seen as part of the problem in front of school admins. Call it a mediation session, which the school should be facilitating. \n\nIf they weren't aware and disprove of ace's behaviour then they'll talk with them.
