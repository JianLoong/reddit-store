However, there is one person (i\u2019ll call them Ace) who I have tension with who had apparently gone to the teacher and complained about solely me claiming I was talking about them. I was pulled aside and scolded by the teacher, even after I denied it. I know mostly everyone in all of my classes and I have never heard this complaint, so it definitely shocked me.

I have refused to work with them because of the incident, which caused Ace to become upset.

There's people in this world who assume that if you're speaking in a foreign language or even a coded language that you're doing it because you're talking about them. Some of these people get so offended that they can't understand what you're saying that you must be doing it on purpose specifically to talk about them that they sometimes resort to violence. In this case they resorted to telling school officials. For the school it's a he-said he-said situation. They don't know what you said but are assuming the other student wouldn't be lying. I don't know how you would prove you aren't talking about him unfortunately. I understand the importance and comfort of talking to your friend in your first language and you shouldn't be restricted to where you can speak but do be aware there are AH and be careful if your safety is in danger.\n\nEdit: As others have said get your parents involved.", "NTA - I think there are three conflicting issues here which you should raise with a teacher and admin:\n\n1. That you do have a right to speak your home language and should not be shamed for this or prevented from speaking your language\n2. That the class teacher, presumably not speaking Bahasa, can't understand what you are saying and therefore finds it difficult to manage the class and deal with these bullying complaints\n3. That you feel Ace is bullying you by making false accusations and making it so you can't speak your own home language at school.\n\nWhere there is harassment, the teacher is likely to have to ask you to speak in English because it's the only way for them to ensure there is no harassment (both to keep from escalating issues at school and to protect you from false accusations). It might be that you will need to be speaking English during class time and Indonesian during the break times as you like - just do it away from Ace. Do be mindful as well that when you are speaking Indonesian, you are cutting out everyone else - including your other classmates. There will often be times when academic discussion is required to be in English for learning purposes.\n\nYou could also talk to the teacher about wanting to be able to speak your home language and ask the teacher what kind of things need to be put in place for you to be able to do that. I think you'll find they can't ban you completely (looks super racist because... it is...) so you should make sure they give you clear guidelines (in writing) so you can't get in trouble for doing it.\n\nYou should also ask to have it formally recorded that you not be placed with or near Ace, and to have your explanation of these interactions recorded formally. I don't think you should apologise - you should just make it very clear and request that it is formally noted that you did not in fact mention them in any way and that just because Ace is accusing you of it does not mean it actually happened that way. Do be mindful of any Indonesian that could be misleading and sound like Ace's name. Be aware too that your comment, \"Both my friend and I have never name-dropped them in any conversations because we\u2019re not that stupid to do it with them in the same vicinity as us,\" clearly implies a level of dislike - not unwarranted- so going forward, know that that is likely clear to all parties that you are on bad terms. \n\nAt the same time - if Ace doesn't speak Indonesian, they clearly cannot have a clue what you were talking about. This should be pointed out too! Do you have any witnesses? Things for stuff like body language, eye contact, tone of voice - if people can attest you weren't looking at Ace, or speaking in a mean tone, or pointing and so on then how would Ace know you were talking about them, given they can't speak the language? You can certainly express concern about this false accusation being racially motivated given the clear outcome seems to be to ban you from speaking your home language...", "NTA and I'd make a complaint of xenophobic harassment and make clear you'd be willing to make the school look bad if they take his side", "NTA and you could probably sue the school for this", "NTA\nYou are doing nothing wrong. You are being discriminated against by Ace and the school administration.", "Do not apologize. \nTell your parents that you have been threatened by a classmate.\nGo directly to the principal and school board and advise them that you are being discriminated against. Go as high as you need to.\n\nYou did NOTHING wrong. You are NTA", "NTA. \n\nI would also tell your school administration that banning someone from speaking their language was one of the tactics that was ruled by the UN to be a Genocide in the Residential School system, and that if they try to restrict your use of your own language, you have every right to file a human rights complaint against the school.", "NTA.  Never the asshole for speaking your language even if it makes the ignorant and less educated insecure.  Always be proud that you speak another language and thank you for bringing that cultural diversity to all of us!", "NTA! This \"Ace\" person is a racist, or at least xenophobic.  They targeted you, and you do not need to take that shit. They understood that the adults would not be able to verify what was said since the adults do not speak Indonesian. \n\nThe only time students when students in my high school \"couldn't\" speak their first language was because we we're in French class and the school insisted the dual-lingual English and Spanish speakers try being tri-lingual.", "ESH being uncomfortable hearing a foreign language is racist\n\nSpeaking foreign language when you are surrounded by others that dont speak the language is rude when you have the ability to speak the communal language", "As a teacher - it is definitely possible if the speakers are obvious enough. You'd be surprised at how many kids say stuff that is *obviously* a slur (and they make it obvious to harass the victim) then get surprised when the victim picks up that they're being harassed...  many students are not as smart as they think they are.
