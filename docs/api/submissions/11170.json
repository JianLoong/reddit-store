Pretty much right away, she tried telling me i wasn't allowed to sit on \"her couch\" or use her TV. And I said i stg I would order a couch and TV that very second and pile it in the living room next to her stuff because she can't just take over a common area without even giving me a real chance to contribute to it.

If she crashes, you would be screwed.", "NTA. \n\nIt may be just silly shit to her to make you go out and buy your own EVERYTHING. She tried to make a big deal about sharing a TV and a couch in a shared living area, FFS. \"I don't share, but you have to?\" Nuh-uh. \n\nQ: Is there any other way for her to get to class?", "Nahhh fuck that, NTA. That roommate sounds like a nightmare roommate. I don\u2019t know what kind of car you own but a car is too expensive to lend to someone you don\u2019t like or even trust. Plus, your insurance probably wouldn\u2019t cover her if she got in an accident.", "NTA. What happens if she has an accident? There are so many things to consider here with loaning out a car compared to sitting on a couch.", "NTA. She doesn't share salt & pepper but wants you to share your car. Soooooo NTA.", "NTA she\u2019s not insured on it, what if she has an accident. Do not lend her your car.", "NTA.\n\nShe doesn't actually want a sharing/reciprocal relationship, she's just hard up and figured that she could use your good nature for her benefit. That's not how relationships work.", "NTA. Not only don't let her use your car, don't let *anyone* use your car. Ever.

She effed around; now she\u2019s found out.", "Tell your boyfriend to lend her his car if he\u2019s so concerned. She set these weird boundaries and didn\u2019t foster a good enough relationship to warrant car privileges. NTA", "NTA. You aren't friends, and she isn't paying your insurance.

She is allowed to have boundaries but not you?   Fuck that.  In addition, many people borrow cars, get in accidents, etc.  Is there no bus she can take?", "NTA\n\nthe onus is on her...if she actually had a light bulb moment and came and apologised and owned her shit it would be different. \n\nIf she wants to sit and cry about it instead of taking action and getting on a bus, that is on her.", "NTA, she set the line where the borrowing/sharing boundary is and now is suffering the consequences of her own actions.\n\nNTA, was it mean? Yes, but then I\u2019m a petty AH too and would\u2019ve said the same thing too.", "Well, your actions definitely highlighted the consequences of a hardline no sharing policy. I hope that Dana has taken the lesson you taught her to heart. Having said that, I'm going to judge you as YTA. The proper path would be to have a heart to heart talk with her and ask if she sees the repercussions of her militant anti-sharing and is willing to rescind it completely and make life easier for both of you. If she says yes, loan her your car. If she says no, then she has made her choice and can live with the consequences. If you decide to do that then you would no longer be an AH. Good luck to both of you.", "Nope.\n\nThere is a risk of an accident happening and she hasn't earned enough good will for you to take that risk.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She's right its not the same thing, if she fucks up your car then YOU are out of a vehicle. And screw being the bigger person, she was ready to make it damn near impossible to use the living room until you called her on her shit, I wouldn't trust her with my car either. Mostly because people like that often have no respect for other people's thing, just their own. \n\nIts not your responsibility to provide her with transportation & she's an adult.

Perfectly reasonable boundary and not at all the same as sharing a TV or a couch. \n\nShe can\u2019t ride share? Take the bus?", "Even if you were total besties and shared everything, lending out your car is too risky. Is she going to pay for gas? Is she going to pay the insurance? Is she going to pay for any damages or repairs? If she can\u2019t manage her business without relying on a near stranger, how is she going to manage her life? Surely there are other options to get to class/work. Other people figure this stuff out! Not every college kid has a car.", "NTA Fuck that and fuck her! She needs to find alternative means of travel, just like any other adult person with no back up, bus, cab, Uber, car share, rental, bike it for Christ sake. She is not even a friend, her problems are not yours. And why does your BF even care?

She can also invest in a bike or just get a loan and pay for a new car or to fix hers.\n\nI'd consider maybe giving her rides in exchange for gas money.

I am glad you said no. Last thing anyone should ever do is let someone borrow their car. The risk is too high to take and can have huge financial and legal consequences for you if something was to go wrong.
