That roommate sounds like a nightmare roommate. I don\u2019t know what kind of car you own but a car is too expensive to lend to someone you don\u2019t like or even trust. Plus, your insurance probably wouldn\u2019t cover her if she got in an accident.", "NTA. What happens if she has an accident? There are so many things to consider here with loaning out a car compared to sitting on a couch.", "NTA. She doesn't share salt & pepper but wants you to share your car. Soooooo NTA.", "NTA she\u2019s not insured on it, what if she has an accident. Do not lend her your car.", "NTA.\n\nShe doesn't actually want a sharing/reciprocal relationship, she's just hard up and figured that she could use your good nature for her benefit. That's not how relationships work.", "NTA. Not only don't let her use your car, don't let *anyone* use your car. Ever.

Yes, but then I\u2019m a petty AH too and would\u2019ve said the same thing too.", "Well, your actions definitely highlighted the consequences of a hardline no sharing policy. I hope that Dana has taken the lesson you taught her to heart. Having said that, I'm going to judge you as YTA. The proper path would be to have a heart to heart talk with her and ask if she sees the repercussions of her militant anti-sharing and is willing to rescind it completely and make life easier for both of you. If she says yes, loan her your car. If she says no, then she has made her choice and can live with the consequences. If you decide to do that then you would no longer be an AH. Good luck to both of you.", "Nope.\n\nThere is a risk of an accident happening and she hasn't earned enough good will for you to take that risk.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She's right its not the same thing, if she fucks up your car then YOU are out of a vehicle. And screw being the bigger person, she was ready to make it damn near impossible to use the living room until you called her on her shit, I wouldn't trust her with my car either. Mostly because people like that often have no respect for other people's thing, just their own. \n\nIts not your responsibility to provide her with transportation & she's an adult.

Is she going to pay for any damages or repairs? If she can\u2019t manage her business without relying on a near stranger, how is she going to manage her life? Surely there are other options to get to class/work. Other people figure this stuff out! Not every college kid has a car.", "NTA Fuck that and fuck her! She needs to find alternative means of travel, just like any other adult person with no back up, bus, cab, Uber, car share, rental, bike it for Christ sake.
