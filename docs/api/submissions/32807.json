She used to used the hair drier in the room as well. Talked to her about it, she didn't think she was being unreasonable. The fix , was when she was on a day off. I would get up and do the same. Only took a few days to see the error of her ways.", "NTA Needlessly robbing someone of sleep is an A-hole move; you have a right to be upset about being woken up early -- which could affect your whole day.\n\nI'd tell her that you'd really appreciate it if she would just be understanding and accommodate you, but if she doesn't you will stop taking any care on your side to avoid waking her up and will get ready upstairs just as she does -- not out of revenge, but because if she can't understand by you simply telling her she may need to be in your shoes to get that you're not just \"moaning.\" After a few sleep-deprived days she may pull her head in.", "NTA\n\n>She says I'm just moaning for no reason and she don't wanna hear it.\n\nDoes she even like you?", "NTA\n\nSuper shitty of your gf to be that inconsiderate. Also, why won't she just move to the bathroom to do her makeup?", "NTA. That's just inconsiderate, selfish, and disrespectful. When I get up earlier than my husband, I take everything into the bathroom the night before. If she doesn't understand it, start doing the same to her. She'll soon stop.", "NTA it's really not that hard for you girlfriend to not be waking you up every morning.", "NTA. I cannot for the life of me understand the basic lack of consideration some people have for others", "This is a hill to die on. If she can't understand why lack of sleep is detrimental to your health, you might as well dump her. \n\nCan you imagine all your life if you stay with this woman, you will feel like this until you die? \n\nShe will be putting on makeup until she dies.\n\nThe lack of consideration she shows for you, you may just snap and regret it because you're so tired anyway.\n\nLack of deep sleep is not a joke, man.\n\nEdit: NTA, man. You deserve better. Everyone deserves sleep unless you have cats. Cats own all the hours.", "NTA\n\nDo the same thing next time you wake up before her, and she'll quickly learn how disruptive it is.\n\nAlso, do your shifts prevent you from both just going to sleep a little earlier and waking at the same time?", "NTA \nIs there a reason why she doesn\u2018t want to use the bathroom?", "NTA - that's just disrespectful and rude of her.\nHave a party at 3am in your room and see how she feels.", "NTA\n\nI have travelled and shared rooms with people who really need their sleep. I go to the bathroom to do my makeup. \n\nIn this case, talk to her and come to a negotiation with her. Would you be able to install a vanity with lights for her in another room? Are you able to change your current room setup so that the vanity could be part of a walk-in so she can do her makeup there and turn on only those lights?", "NTA I would snap if someone woke me up before I had to get up, let alone if it happened all the time. Why the hell are you with an inconsiderate AH?", "Guessin she walks all over u in other ways as wel", "NTA but I\u2019m guessing she does this because the mirror is better in the bedroom? Maybe buy her a nice makeup mirror for Christmas that he can use in another room?", "NTA. My ex wouldn\u2019t turn off lights and tv in our bedroom when we went to bed. This was straight up abuse as I had hard time catching normal sleep hours. You need your sleep", "Depends how big your place is.  If she has just had a shower in the bathroom, then it's not a good place to do her makeup and it might not be as comfortable.\n\nI would say that she's your partner, be more understanding and tollerant.  She's not doing it to piss you off.  Maybe she just wants to be close to you whilst she does it!  I have no idea, but this isn't a huge issue.", "Get up and make her a coffee. \n\nCouples shouldn\u2019t compete with one another.", "Get in line bruh, every girl does that.

She is being rude and selfish.", "that would absolutely drive me insane. there is a bathroom with a light down the hall just go use that! how horribly inconsiderate, sleep is LIFE!", "NTA, there is a bathroom she can use?! She should just use that. My gf is another person that just doesn't give a shit if I'm sleeping, she'll just turn on the light to do whatever she wants to do.\n\nYour gf is selfish, if you lived in a studio with only one room or something, OK, but she has a bathroom she can use.", "NTA my boy and i have the same Problem. So i go in the bathroom to do the make up", "NTA. Unless there's a makeup vanity in your room, there's no reason for her to do it. Start turning on the lights when you get up. She may legit be someone it doesn't bother, but if not, she'll  figure it out quickly.", "NTA.  Your gf doesn't care for you. She doesn't even see you. The only hope of changing this is to show her how it feels.  But this won't make her care for you. She'll only change because it impacts her.\n\nMy ex did this. If I'd paid attention to this red flag, my life would be so much better now.", "NTA I like to do my makeup in the room too and sometimes my partner is asleep and the lights are off too. Instead I just go sit in another corner of the room and either use a small lamp or handheld ring light. Maybe you should buy her one of those if you still see a future with her after she\u2019s kind of being a dick about it. If my partner told me I was waking him up by doing a task I can do somewhere else just as easy I would have no problems moving to another room. I don\u2019t see why people don\u2019t just listen to their partners and accommodate them, I\u2019m sure she would expect you to accommodate her if you inconvenienced her.

What are our other recourses???", "I also find just moving yourself to sleep comfortably in another room EXACTLY how you like is a good way to get the point across, it\u2019s non confrontational and if they like the comfort of you sleeping there they MAY change their ways.", "While I agree on the shitty of her to do so, I need a vanity to do my makeup, which is in my room. I can't do it in the bathroom because a) the lighting is wrong, and b) there's no place to put a vanity.\n\nThere might be legitimate reasons but that doesn't mean they shouldn't find a solution that world for both of them. There are many options. Like having seperate rooms, or setting up a vanity somewhere else, etc.", "Maybe she pisses all over him as well...", "Nah.

They are full.\n3)bold of you to assume a girls makeup would fit in one of those Itty bitty mirror trays.\n4)many prefer to do makeup at a table, because you need to support your elbow and pinky to draw straight and symmetrical lines. a sink is too low for that, and it being in between you and the  mirror causes problems.\n\n\nPersonally, I'm in the everyone should have their own bedroom camp. You can still cuddle and sleep over at night, but everyone has their own space when they need it in the morning  or during the day. If anyone needs to WFH, no ine has to be quiet or silent in the common areas.

There's one three miles from my house, very much in the US.", "The comment was based on an assumption, if he said \u201cno she likes the bathroom mirror\u201d the gift would be pointless anyway.

In Australia we call them \"$2 shops\" to account for conversion rate.", "Go reread that again. *I'm* not in the US so the dollar store isn't an option \ud83d\ude02 (we also don't have any equivalent shops like some countries do like 100 yen shops or apparently AUS 2$ shops)", "In retrospect, a typo does make more sense.
