Your brother-in-law is clearly taking advantage of your hospitality and overstaying his welcome. It's your house, your sanctuary, and he's trampling all over it without a care in the world. You shouldn't have to suffer in silence just to spare his sensitive feelings. It's time to put your foot down and reclaim your home.\n\nForget about your husband's concerns. This is your space too, and you deserve to have peace and privacy. Tell your brother-in-law that you appreciate his visit but it's time for him to find alternative accommodations. Be clear about your needs and explain that you need the spare room for your work. Don't let him guilt-trip you with his sob stories about lack of family support. He's taking advantage of your kindness, and it's time to assert yourself.\n\nIf your husband won't take the lead, then you need to step up and have that conversation yourself. Five days should be more than enough time for him to make other arrangements. You don't have to make up excuses about friends visiting; just be honest and direct.

Your husband needs to man up and send his brother marching. Having said that though, I suspect there is more to this situation. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he and his wife have split up. Has he spoken to her at all since coming over?", "NTA, the BIL is being absolutely ridiculous. If your husband's so obsessed with preserving the relationship, he needs to have an honest conversation with his brother about what's going on here, because something's clearly out of whack here and that conversation can inform what you do next.\n\nIf the BIL is honest about what's going on and how long he truly needs to stay to get his shit together, maybe the three of you can come to an agreement about how long he stays where everyone ends up as comfortable as possible without you having to be the bad cop and issuing an ultimatum or having to make up some ruse about why you need the room in your own house.\n\nBut if he keeps up this charade where he's obviously lying, someone needs to put their foot down and if it has to be you, so be it, at that point you've exhausted all reasonable options and it's time for this freeloader to get out of your damn house. If your husband can't see that he's being taken advantage of, that's his problem.", "Wait\u2026 he wanted to bring your mother in law to see the house before the wife came to see it? \nThere\u2019s more going on here.

It\u2019s possible he told your husband but asked him not to say anything. Either way he needs to look for apartments for himself not this charade of looking for a house, or put an offer in already if he\u2019s telling the truth.

Depending on the laws where you live, he may be considered a tenant, or very close to it. \n\nI agree that it's likely he's separating from his wife, and may have lost or already quit his job.  Your husband may already know, and is stalling.

Given the timing of your own recent move, I would seriously speak with your husband and ask if they had previously discussed the possibility of brother moving in with you longer term.  \"Fixing the house\" and the fact that it has sat on the market with no other offers for at least a month makes me question if there won't be more excuses to extend his stay until the house is habitable (assuming he actually buys it).", "He\u2019s always between jobs\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f his wife and he often do this, they just kind of float along, live in their trailer (where she is on the east coast), or stay with people for a while until they go back home - they don\u2019t seem to mind being so unsettled and somehow find people who will let them visit like this", "Time for him to get a new job and get back home so you won't loose your job.
