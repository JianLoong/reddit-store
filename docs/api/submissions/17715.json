Your brother-in-law is clearly taking advantage of your hospitality and overstaying his welcome. It's your house, your sanctuary, and he's trampling all over it without a care in the world. You shouldn't have to suffer in silence just to spare his sensitive feelings. It's time to put your foot down and reclaim your home.\n\nForget about your husband's concerns. This is your space too, and you deserve to have peace and privacy. Tell your brother-in-law that you appreciate his visit but it's time for him to find alternative accommodations. Be clear about your needs and explain that you need the spare room for your work. Don't let him guilt-trip you with his sob stories about lack of family support. He's taking advantage of your kindness, and it's time to assert yourself.\n\nIf your husband won't take the lead, then you need to step up and have that conversation yourself. Five days should be more than enough time for him to make other arrangements. You don't have to make up excuses about friends visiting; just be honest and direct. Don't let him continue to dictate your home and future plans. You deserve better. So, no, you wouldn't be the asshole for asking him to leave. In fact, it's about time you reclaim your space and sanity.", "has your BIL and wife broken up?", "NTA. your BIL is clearly taking advantage of you and your husband. I don't think he is \"sensitive\" I think he has just been manipulative with your husband as they grew up, and he is still doing it now, and even planning on playing the same cards for getting free hands to help with his house.\nI'm very sorry for your husband, but your freeloader BIL needs to go.", "NTA. Instead of lying about someone coming, I would just let him know that you expected it to be a short-term stay and that he needs to go home now. Be kind but firm.", "NTA. Your BIL is clearly taking advantage. If you dont do something fast, you'll be stuck with him forever.", "NTA. Tell him that you work from home and need to set up your office in that room so he needs to go. No sugar coating. No compromise. He\u2019s already abused you way too many times. He\u2019s done. And never let him come back. He showed you who he was.", "NO. You are NTA at all!  Meet directly with your husband, tell him over four weeks is unacceptable & why, and ask him to facilitate a departure date with his brother.  If he has nowhere to go, he must talk to his parents.", "NTA\n\nSay whatever you have to. Get him out and don't let him come back. Also, start giving him chores and make jokes about him paying rent.", "NTA ..  . House guests are like fish  they go off after 3 days!!", "You don't have a BIL problem. You have a husband problem.\n\nTell hubby that if he won't talk to his brother, you will. Give him a deadline to talk to him, and if he doesn't, then it's out of his hands.\n\nBIL is clearly enjoying his expense free vacation. He can move to a hotel, if it really takes him three weeks to decide if he wants to buy that house.\n\nNTA", "NTA for wanting him gone and out of your space.
