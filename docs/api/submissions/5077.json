It's okay to feel underwhelmed or uninterested after a meet, but it is incredibly insulting and degrading to just \"dip\" after saying you're going to follow her home to do a pre-planned cookie making/ chill activity.  Can you even imagine how that made her feel?  She has to feel awful for being played to this extent to where you didn't even think she deserved honesty about how you felt at that point.  She had been looking forward to the evening and had thoughtfully planned out an innocent \"getting to know you\"  activity, and then you \"dip\".. after buying ingredients for cookie making at her place.  She deserved so much better than this, it's just sad and I feel so much for her.  You owe her an apology.  Not another date, but a forthright apology.

Imagine you go on a date and once you start heading towards sex your date just dissappear, that's going to hurt your self esteem. \nYou feel mislead that the mom was home but I doubt she withheld that for any purpose. Maybe it wasn't a big deal to her and she didn't think it would be for you. \nFinal note. You mentioned how she's fatter and paler than her photos.
