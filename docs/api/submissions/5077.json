I have been ghosted in a similar way (not a date but a \u2018friend\u2019 who invited me to a party but didn\u2019t actually want me to go) and it was embarassing at first.

If you'd politely said that you'd changed your mind and you were leaving then I'd have said N A H, maybe even N T A since it is considered polite to warn a date if parents are going to be involved.

Cookies, yay!\n\nBut she mentions that she lives with her mom/mom will be there. You say nothing. You just dip out because she's obviously good enough to fuck but not to be seen with? Not to have her mom know? So you ran, and that means you need to grow up.

If the main issues was the mother, say \u201chey, I\u2019m not really comfortable meeting someone\u2019s mom on the first date, especially with what we planned to do.

You should have been a little more communicative and said you\u2019re tired or some other lame excuse. So is life, so is dating. Next time, do better ok?", "YTA for ghosting the date. You could have made any excuse and cut it short.", "YTA. You could have simply told her you\u2019re uncomfortable with going to her place if her mom was there.", "YTA why not use tour adult words and just say look I had a nice night but honestly I'm just not feeling it. Instead of running away?", "INFO When you reached home\u2026 Did you follow up with a text / email apologizing and letting her know that you no longer felt comfortable?

You sound like a huge double.", "YTA. \nGhosting mid date is shit, you could have done a number of things to get out of it. \nNot to mention she\u2019s 20, it\u2019s normal for a 20 year old to live with their parents. Hell, I\u2019m 24 and I live with my family.", "YTA. But you did her a favor.", "YTA - not for not going to her place but for simply turning around without telling her. That\u2019s a dick move and she will spend the entire evening wondering what she did wrong and feel like shit. Instead of communicating like an adult, you ran away like a child.", "YTA. You couldn\u2019t be an adult about it and just tell her that you weren\u2019t comfortable coming over when her mom was there, so instead you just disappear on her?", "YTA it would have been so easy to be a normal human in this situation. Just brush up on your social skills, you normally say goodbye before leaving.", "Totally fine and pretty funny. Women love to use filtered/old photos that make them look great which isn't any surprise, but alot of little lies add up quick. Clearly a hook up situation, no one is going to give you a high five but the reddit white knight clowns & cat ladies will eat you alive for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext time just tell her no dice to her face rather than booking it on your bike.

You both planned the whole situation out.\nBut she didn\u2019t tell you her mum was home.\nIt\u2019s not weird for women to leave a date without saying anything if they\u2019re uncomfortable. Sure it might suck for the other person, but it\u2019s easier to run away than to start an argument, be gaslight or peer pressured into staying.\n\nI lost my virginity to a guy I was dating years ago at his house. If I got there and his parents were there I would leave too. \n\nIt is 100% something your date should mention especially if you\u2019re loosing your virginity because it can be very scary for some people.\n\nAnd for everyone assuming he left because she was fat, that\u2019s your own biases talking.

Extremely immature of you to not just communicate that with her.", "YTA, should have said something", "The fact you even have to ask if YTA shows that you're not mature enough to date.
