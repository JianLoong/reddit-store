Before I start with the event that has let me here I would like to give some background. \n\nWe have been married for almost 20 years and have 2 kids. When we got together I could barely cook while he had quite some skills. We used to cook together and he has taught me a lot. However since we had our second child (9y ago) I have become a decent cook. \n\nFor the past 2 years of so I have been doing the majority of the cooking includes planning and grocery shopping. This means I cook almost every day. We used to eat out or get takeout about twice a week. But have reused that to about 2 a month to safe money. He occasionally cooks but it's unpredictable when. \n\nWe ended up with this allocation of labour because 2 years ago he had a very demanding job with crazy hours. Now he is not in that job anymore but has taken on voluntary charity work that takes some of his time. And he is trying to build a business. I also work a full time job. We earn about the same. \n\nThis devision of labour has been a point of conflict in the past but I have stopped bringing it up as much as I can. Since it won't change anything. When we fight it still comes up though. \n\nNow to where I might be the AH. Today I cooked while he was working at the kitchen table. The meal I made was a new one for me. I make a noodle dish which used some rice noodles and also egg. When I put the eggs in the pan it was quite hot enough. So he proceeded to explain to me that the pan needs to be really hot. I told him I know and didn't need his explanation. I was probably very abrasive in saying that. The rice noodles break during prepation as I had forgotten to take them out of the fridge. When finished the meal turned out decent with some room for improvement but not bad at all. He did say it was quite tasty and a good change of routine. I agreed but said next time I need to remember to take the noodles out beforehand so they don't break. He then went on a long and detailed explanation that you always have to take food out if the fridge first. I got agitated and told him I know that and don't need explanation. He wouldn't stop and when on and on. To which I said I really don't appreciate that I cook every day and then he has to comment on it negatively almost every time. It went downhill from there. \n\nIn my husband's view he is helping me out and giving constructive criticism. He also thinks I am to sensitive and he can't say anything at all (his words). \n\nI on the other hand feel that my work is not appreciated and that I am being judged/critiqued. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680101792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125qocb/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_stop_giving/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's not there to be your instructor, overseer, or cooking mentor.\n\nBut you both also need to get to the point of being able to converse like reasonable adults. You saying \"I KNOW\" in an abrasive way every time he says ANYTHING constructive is childish and closed minded.

Even if it turned out fine, you might say \"next time, don't forget the dryer sheet\" or something to that effect.  \n\nMy issue here is that it didn't sound like he was nitpicking, it sounded like he was informing you of the correct cooking technique.  You seem to acknowledge he was correct, you just aren't happy he told you.  \n\nI feel like you need to discuss your actual issue here.  Because I don't think its healthy for him to never be able to mention when something is being done wrong.  Because I have a feeling, if you forgot a step, and he watched you mess up the entire dish, you'd also be mad that he didn't say anything.", "I never cease to be amazed every time a woman asks for honesty in a relationship, then is flummoxed when they actually get it!", ">He did say it was quite tasty and a good change of routine.\n\nYTA a little. Your 20-year resentment with household general division of labor and cooking in particular is obviously affecting your reactions here to what sounds like normal conversation to me. \n\nHe's in the same room while you're making dinner, it's typical to remark on it.
