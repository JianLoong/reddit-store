Go to him and tell your brother to talk to your dad first if not you will because you don't want him to have a heart attack.", "NTA. Is it not considered a bad idea to name your child after early deceased person in United States? \n\nThis is horrible to say, but if something happens to your nephew, \"that name\" will be extra traumatizing to your dad and him.", "NAH.

That way, he can Honour your late brother, aswell as letting the kid have his own life, instead of being a \"Second version\" of someone else.", "NTA but you need to tell your brother to tell your dad before the kid comes and get his blessing or you\u2019ll do it for him. Don\u2019t let him surprise your dad with it. Let your dad make the call. He might actually feel honoured but your brother is an asshole for trying to spring it.", "I'm going to vote NAH\n\nI think your brother may be mildly A H for not actually discussing this with your father first and not considering your feelings, but at the same time grief is complicated and he's still trying to navigate that in the best way he sees possible. I understand his thinking, though.\n\nTry to convince him to talk this out with your father before his son is born.", "NTA.  I think you're right, and it will just bring pain to what should be a joyous occasion, and be a constant painful reminder.", "NTA, have a talk with your dad.  Honestly the if he is having trauma dealing with going places, they frequented together this surprise could induce a traumatic breakdown.  You do not have to fully out your brother just start to talk about the name. As would he like it \"if it was a middle name or maybe even a first name\". Work from there.  This could also be enough for your dad to totally reject his grandchild/", "NTA\n\nI wasn't named after my mom, but I do look a lot like my mom and she died when I was 12. When I got a bit older, a teenager, my grandfather sometimes called me by her name by mistake and I could see he got sad sometimes. I hated being called by her name. Now I understand it, because I'm an adult, and I cannot imagine what's like loosing a child. \n\nYour brother is an asshole and lacks empathy. He can use it as a middle name, but not an every day name. His son is not a replacement and it's also incredibly raw. Everyone is going to get hurt. His future son and your dad too.", "Idk people of reddit. Honestly he should talk to his father about honoring Jake's memory. Doing something as a \"happy surprise\" is not always a good idea. It might go over well, but it also might open old wounds for your father. \n\nMaybe naming after your father and Jake would be nice, so they'll always be together would be nice.

My husband and I have been pregnant (and miscarried) twice during this time period, and were talking baby names at one point with my in-laws when my MIL said that she really did not want us to name our child after the children she lost (husbands brother and SIL). She just couldn't imagine yelling their names if the child was misbehaving, or even celebrating the occasions with my children that we couldn't with hers-- they were only 21 when they died. There's so much more to it than just the name. So much more context, so many situations where it can trigger some real serious feelings.\n\nMaybe send your brother this thread?\n\nEither way, you are absolutely NTA. Your brother would be if he sprung this on your dad without at least talking about it, but, honestly, you are 100% right: you lost a brother too.

As in, a *person*, not a building or a boat or some other object you might be entitled to give a name as a monument to the dead. Naming a child after someone recently passed, that the family is still grieving, is a really awful, performative and self-centered thing to do. No child should be saddled with the weight of all that grief of a painful loss.\n\nMy perspective is informed by my husband\u2019s experience. He is named after his uncle \u2014 his mother\u2019s brother who tragically died before he was born. His oldest sister told me she tried to dissuade their mother from doing that, but she insisted. My husband has had to deal with feeling like a shadow looms over him his whole life, a shadow cast by *his own name*. I mean, who would want that? It is absolutely, 1000% not okay to do that to a child. Your brother should find some other way to pay tribute to Jake, and give his child a name that is not loaded with all kinds of baggage for everyone around him.", "I\u2019d honestly debate you telling your dad now to kinda force the conversation bc I have a feeling your bro won\u2019t and this is gonna just go badly regardless. Good luck, sorry about your bro :(", "NTA, your brother needs to have the conversation with your Dad, or his happy surprise will turn into an argument about \"why can't you just be happy for me\".", "I can see your brothers side, but springing it on your dad is so wrong. Losing a child is much worse than losing a sibling. We will all lose a sibling. A parent should never have to bury their child. If he won\u2019t, you need to tell your Dad so he is fore warned. Perhaps your Dad can tell him to pull his head out of his arse. Your brother\u2019s name as a middle name I can see, but your nephew deserves to be his own person. I was named for my Aunt who died at 9mths old & it only reminded everyone of her being gone.", "NTA\n\nThe other issue is the burden on the boy for carrying a recently deceased relative's name.  \n\nRight now, you are d\\*mned if you tell your dad about this, and d\\*mned if you don't.

Your brother really should talk to your dad about this.", "Talk to your brother and explain that while you understand that the naming isn\u2019t your choice, you would very much like for him to not have it be a *surprise* after the baby is born.

But sure, to answer your question, I have never met anyone else with that name, so I suppose it makes the association even stronger. It\u2019s fully within reason to feel instinctively sad when I hear it.\n\nNo one would have stopped my sister if she\u2019d shared her intentions. I would\u2019ve liked the chance to say \u201cname him what you want, but I will always feel uncomfortable and likely call him by his middle name\u201d. There\u2019s no way I will ever let my nephew know this gives me grief, so after I found out, I never told my sister how it affected me. However, she made a decision in a silo without regard to how others might feel, and we live with it.\n\nGrief is complicated and OP\u2019s father deserves to privately process his grandson\u2019s name outside of a baby announcement.", "Agreed.  I named my firstborn after my deceased father and if anyone had said one negative word to me I would have cut them out of my life.  No one owns a name", "Agreed.  In my case it was already known that my cousin would name his firstborn son after our deceased uncle. \n\nOur uncle got killed in a car accident many years ago and when my wife was pregnant she asked me if I wanted to name our son after him.  I said no because I have a cousin who has the same last name as his (my mother is their sister) and it wouldn\u2019t make as much sense for me to do that.  While I think my family would have been pleased, I felt that my only other male cousin on that side should have that right.  \n\nPersonally I think the parents would be honored (I think I would be) but everyone grieves differently so it may be good idea for him to talk to them ahead of time.", "My middle names are after deceased family members exactly because of this.

That\u2019s why I have dealt with my feelings privately, because there\u2019s no sense in hurting her over this. But as I said, I do wish she had told me privately, I did not like having to process it in front of the whole world when she announced it to a large group of us.", "So you do have experience with this situation? I\u2019d love to hear more.", "Considering she remarried less than a year after he died, yes.  And I was LC with her before my son was born so going NC would have been no big deal", "Ok, so I picked the wrong family member as an example. What about someone you actually like?", "Yeah, no judgement on whther or not he should name the kid Jake...but brother is 100% AH for making this a \"SUPRISE!\" moment for your dad. He ABSOLUTELY needs to discuss this first. Maybe do an end run around brother and talk to your SIL. You are NTA for insisting this not be a secret.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA but I have some experience with this myself, and am looking at it with fresh eyes after this post. My husband lost his Mum when he was 10. When I found out I was pregnant (32 years after her passing I might add) he said if it was a girl (she was) he wanted to name her after his Mum. She has a hybrid name, so his mother\u2019s name coupled with a second name. When discussing this with his sister, when she asked about names, she told me straight that we couldn\u2019t but we could give our daughter their mother\u2019s name as a middle name as she had done with her daughter. My husband refused and said he would call his daughter what he wanted. He is not close to his siblings or his father for that matter. His sister is extremely controlling. When I told her our daughter would also be double barreled as we were not married at the time, she told me I couldn\u2019t do that either as our daughter should only have my partner\u2019s surname. And I won\u2019t tell you the type of man his father is. Anyway my daughter has pretty much been forgotten by my husband\u2019s side of the family. I can count on one hand how many times they\u2019ve spent time with her in the last 16 years and still have fingers to spare. I have always believed that the treatment has just been an extension of how they treat my husband but I\u2019m wondering now if her name has played a role?? Either way no I don\u2019t think YTA and I think your brother needs to have a conversation with your dad. This isn\u2019t something he should just announce", "YTA, this isn't your decision to make, as much as I may agree with you on it being an unfortunate mistake. I believe your brother means well.", "Wow your brother is a prick. NTA", "ESH.  You would be well within your right to respond by saying that you think it would be very hard on your dad, but you don't have any right to straight up tell your brother what not to name his child.  Your brother sucks for not considering how your dad would handle it.  Ideally what should happen here is to forget the idea of a surprise and your brother sits down with your dad and says \"I'm thinking of naming my son Jake in honor of him, but I want to make sure you'd be ok with it first.  If you think it'll be too hard on you I'll name him something else\".", "NAH but the only foolish thing here is the surprise part. Naming after someone deceased can be triggering, it can also be life afirming and healing(at least it has always been in my family). Talk it out", "YTA. It's up to him what he names his child. It's not healthy to avoid associations with a deceased family member. Your dad probably needs some grief counselling. He should discuss this with your dad but erasing a family member because it hurts to think of them isn't good. Also consider that this is your brother's way of remembering Jake.", "sorry for your lose but its up to your brother and his wife what he calls his son. but he should speak to your father first just to be sure", "This is stupid. So many people name their children after their parents.", "I think it largely depends on how long the person has been gone for. In this case, yeah it's a terrible idea, especially as a \"surprise\" to the dad (wtf?). \n\n\nWe named my son after my grandfather, who had been gone for about 20 years when the little guy was born, and we still checked with my mom and her two closest brothers before we decided on the name. Enough time had passed that everyone thought it was sweet instead of bringing up sad memories, and it turned out that there are now 5 generations in the family where at least one person has that name, so I thought that was pretty cool. But for recently dead relatives, or for someone who died in a particularly devastating way (ex. Child loss, not grandpa dying peacefully of old age), I agree those names are definitely best left alone.", "No.", "Omg no", "Your brother is self involved. Terrible idea to name without ASKING how dad would feel first", "Explain to your brother that it will not be a happy surprise. Not tell him that he shouldn't use the name, but ask him that he respectfully has a conversation with your dad about his wish to do so. Only then will your brother know whether it's a good idea or not.", "This was a very common thing even a hundred years ago. My mum has been going over our family tree for a while now and this practice is visible pretty much in every generation, in each family, up until my great-greatgrandparents' generation.", "I misread this as my other half-best friend and was like \"how do you have a half best friend? If that's the other one, who's the first one? Are they both halves?\"\n\nIts sweet of you to do that honour.", "Your dad lost his baby named jake. He can\u2019t handle a new baby", "I know it used to be common but that alone doesn\u2019t make it right or wrong. It also used to be common for parents and teachers to hit kids.", "Tell Jeremy he has 1 week to discuss it with your father or your telling him. The potential for distress and upset is too great to consider doing this as a surprise. NTA", "Nah, you\u2019re not the AH", "NAH\n\nEverybody deals with grief differently. Have your brother discuss it with your dad ASAP.", "My son is only 18mo old but I know if he passed and someone named their child after mine to honor him, I don't know if I could handle saying the name looking at another little boy. Not for a while, anyway. And if your dad is only just getting back to normal, your brother should really talk to him. It may set him back and not be the reaction your brother wants.\n\nNTA. Definitely get your brother to talk to your dad.", "I think you should talk to your dad about it. I mean ask him if he's okay with it. Your brother is grieving too, it's his way, we can't say anything. But maybe he and your dad can have a talk. Nta", "Except Dad doesn't know. Brother will \"surprise\" him by handing him his grandson and go \"meet Jake\". It's extremely cruel towards OP's father who will have no time to get used to having a new baby with his late baby's name. That's cruel.", "Right, he means well by hiding this from his grieving dad and \"surprising him\" when handing him his grandson. Sure.", "That's an AH move by your brother. Springing the source of daily pain on your father as a surprise is not going to be a welcome surprise. They should *talk* about it.", "OP, there's another reason he shouldn't be named after Jake. Because there's a good chance he'll end up being compared to him.", "No, by wanting to honor his brother. He's showing emotion, no Reddit troll like you would understand that.", " \n\nHe's showing emotion, a reddit troll like you can't understand.", "You don't know that, neither does the OP or his brother. Most people I know would be delighted for their dead child to be honored this way in the family. This new grandchild named after his son could give the father a new lease of life. The right thing to do is to talk to the father, not make decisions on his behalf.", "I don't know if that's the norm everywhere. To honor older relatives that died perhaps is more normal here. But I can't ever imagine anyone I know giving the first name of someone who died tragically young to a newborn, everyone is to messed up to deal with that shit. \n\nWho wants their name to be something that every time its said the older relatives are reminded about the real Jake who died tragically. Let yours kids be their own person, put names you want to honor as middle names imo.", "I didn't say it was \"the norm everywhere\", I said many people feel that way and the father should be asked, because at this point no one knows how he might feel.\n\nAlso, if you grieve in a healthy way, you aren't reminded of a tragedy every time someone says the name. You are reminded of the life that person lived, the love their relatives had for them and their remembrance of them.", "You said \"most\" people you'd know. That's the norm where you are then ain't it? Pointless thing to argue. Just saying that ain't the norm here.\n\nThe thing about extreme tragedies rather than more regular deaths, is that not everyone handles them very well. Which why if you have any empathy and ability to see how family members are handling it... Most would just use a middle name and not name their baby after something that is going to bring stuff up, when people are so fucked up they cant even go to their favourite places anymore.\n\nEven ignoring all family and friends effected. Why woukd anyone want to be a baby with a name that reminds everyone of someone else who died horrifically. Just let the baby be their own person rather than the personification of your grief to make ya feel like your honoring someone. Nobody wants to be a replacement for someone where every time your name is mentioned even if its positive they are thinking of someone else to.\n\nMiddle names honor people and create space to ask why someone has that middle name etc. I don't think you need to make someone have to live up to anything more than that. I am trans and when changed my name I changed the middle name to my mums as she died of cancer and I wanted to be reminded of her, middle names are more than enough for this sort of thing."]}
