Maybe your dad will be ok with it, in which case it\u2019s a non-issue. But this is not the sort of thing that someone should find out at the same time that he is meeting his grandchild.", "NTA. Your brother is misguided and needs to talk to your parents before springing this on them....their grandson is not going to make up for or replace their son/your brother that passed, and your bro could be saddling his baby with a lifetime of grandpa issues.
