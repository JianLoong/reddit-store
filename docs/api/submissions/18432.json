Your bf froze, which is a normal response that some people have to a high stress, threatening situation. I understand why you feel vulnerable and disappointed that your partner didn\u2019t help in the moment, but it\u2019s also unfair to hold it against him.

I think it's really unfair to blame him for freezing up, but you are forgiven & not the asshole in this situation unless you choose to hold this isolated incident over his head & continually deride him about it. It doesn't seem like you needed protecting. It seems like he stepped away & released your hand on instinct then if the hobo wouldn't back off or actually became violent with you I have faith that your bf would have stepped in. Soooo maybe he wasn't freezing up after all, he was just waiting for the hobo's next move.", "Damn yall really mean\n\nAnd some are sexist ngl \n\nNAH, he may have froze or gone into shock.

Yelling at the homeless man wasn't the correct answer. The correct answer is ignore and keep moving. \nI defend myself rather recklessly if something uncomfortable happens to me. When my gf is around, she makes sure I don't continue a confrontation. That is how she protects me. \n\nWhat you want is for your bf to put himself in harm's way to protect you, like a knight in shining armour. But your knight didn't have any armour or a sword as far as I know. You don't know if that man was armed. You don't know what that man was capable of. \nYou don't want to trigger this guy by yelling or punching him. Could have gotten both of you killed.", "NTA this isn't even a gender thing, if two female friends were walking and some dude creeped on one on them, the other one would have her back! I totally defend my friends", "If you think he should have protected you simply because he is a he, then YTA. If he let go of your hand as a conscious decision to distance himself from you, then NTA.

Clearly you had it in hand. And he probably just let go of you out of surprise.", "NAH. The letting go of the hand seems to be a sticking point for people, but if you are about to get into a physical conflict, holding someone\u2019s hand is a very vulnerable posture. You want both hands available to protect yourself or throw a punch. Him holding your hand doesn\u2019t protect you at all. Unless he ran away from you I would say NAH. You expected him to yell at the guy or hit him or something?", "So far NAH. Talk to each other. Talking will give both of you the opportunity to share your feelings and describe your respective experiences of the situation.", "Reading the title I was going to say Y T A but after reading the post I have to go with NAH .\n\nIt is unfair to expect someone to put themselves in danger without hesitation. He might be a man but beyond that he is a human being. He instinctively put himself out of harms way and then froze. This is a natural reaction. \n\nThat doesn't invalidate your own feelings after the fact. Even if you never thought about it before you had an expectation that someone you trust would help when you needed it (generally speaking, or maybe you think guys should white knight for you, I don't know). Well you needed it and he didn't help. There is probably a loss of trust. This is also natural. \n\nIn terms of solutions, there is the really obvious one: talk. Maybe he is stewing in his own shame and talking could help you both work through your emotions. Maybe he is an antifeminist who thinks that women's liberation means women should protect themselves if they don't want to go back to being barefoot and pregnant 24/7. I don't know.\n\nTo be clear talking may not help with the loss of trust and that is also okay. The point is to help you \"debrief\" or whatever the word the pros use is.", "Did you mean \u201cprojecting\u201d instead of \u201cprotecting\u201d in the judgement bot response?", "YTA. Didn't you get the memo from Feminism? It's sexist to think a man should protect a woman since women are stronger than men. Why are you trying to promote \"Toxic masculinity\"? Also, you should 've been able to fend off this homeless person just by expressing your feelings. What's next? Expecting him to change the tires if you get a flat? Unbelievable", "NTA, he witnessed it happen, yet he didn't do anything. You are not at fault here.", "NAH, although it's close for you. Without more information, it's hard to know why your BF \"didn't do anything\". He could have frozen up, which is one normal and natural reaction to being confronted, and wouldn't make him an asshole, simply someone not used to getting into fights (which is probably a good thing?). He could be fairly confident in a fight, and have let go of your hand because he wanted both his hands free. Not reacting and yelling back at the guy is deescalation; yelling back at a drunk guy who accosts you is how you make *sure* that you're gonna be in a fight.\n\nEither way, if someone posted this with the roles reversed and said they were upset that their GF didn't protect them the sub would not be ok with that; it is not ok this way around. Getting rid of gender roles and having equality, which I think is incredibly important, means getting rid of toxic female roles and expectations *and* toxic male roles and expectations, of which this is one.", "NAH\n\nYour boyfriend had a flight response instead of a fight response. \n\nBoth are valid reactions to fear.\n\nYou wanting him to defend you (I'm assuming he is bigger and stronger) is also a valid emotion.\n\nI'm a small woman myself and my response to seeing an altercation is to intervene and jump on in between. I've broken up and prevented fights in public with a lot of people standing around doing nothing. I don't get angry at the other bystanders who do nothing, no one can help their instinctive responses. \nI've seen some big burly dudes get hit in the face when they intervened and this has never happened to me. So your boyfriend might just have avoided getting a blue eye out bloody nose. My experience in general is that if a woman intervenes it just yells at someone to go away/pushes them away there is less likelihood of violence than when a man intervenes. \n\nAnyway, all that aside. Both your feelings and reactions are valid. Talk it over with each other, hash it out. Explain what you need from him in those situations, because knowing what your partner expects can lead to a change in reaction.", "NTA. I am afraid for you for when a similar situation happens in the future. If he can\u2019t react in any way to help/protect you WHILE HE IS THERE, how can you count on him for when something happened and you are by yourself? He also didn\u2019t even ask if you were okay. I would reconsider this relationship or think about other times he has acted like this.", "NTA. At it's core, he should have AT THE VERY LEAST got between you two, even if he didn't say anything.

If he doesn't want to discuss it, or work on his future responses, it will be time to let him go.", "~~~INFO What did you think your boyfriend should do?

My partner swooped round to get in between whilst telling him \"have a good day mate\" and just guided us away. It happened quickly, so he didn't have time to get angry, react badly etc. I would have been gutted and honestly disgusted if he had walked off and left us to deal with it.

For all we know, she could have panicked and frozen when confronted by the homeless man, and in that case, i think the bf would have some right to be upset, because I would expect anyone walking in a city with me to be aware enough to keep moving or discuss before hand if they're inexperienced/need extra help to navigate.", ">So, he let go of her hand \"to be prepared for a confrontation\" but he didn't yell at the homeless man?\n\nYes, because him yelling would have been an active escalation on his part.

OP should probably ask him why he did it, because consulting people online who can\u2019t ask him and are just assuming or guessing is definitely not a good way to clarify that and most people here are just going to tell her that it\u2019s some horrible red flag and she should leave him for that momentary reaction lol.. \n\nIf it actually was a cowardly move and he was about to just ditch her there though, i don\u2019t know how I could respect him after that, and I\u2019m sure that would make a relationship pretty difficult for anybody involved in that situation regardless of conditioning or gender norms or whatever.", "I mentioned this in another comment, but it really is crazy the number of people here focusing on letting go of her hand.

What he said afterwards (\"wow wasn't that crazy haha\") seemed too dismissive. \n\nI realize the original comment made it seem like I was advocating that he yells back, but that's only because people said he was \"readying himself\". I don't see the point of that in my personal opinion, just hold her and keep walking, if she gets injured, it takes just half a second to let go of her hand. And tbh, at then do what? It is also a bad idea to try using your fists on a guy with a knife. The answer is still to try to grab her and run away anyway.", "Of course his life isn't worth less.

If I was OP's boyfriend, I would have done the same as he did. And I would probably just tell my gf to run.\n\nWhy should he defend her ? What if the guy was mentally unstable or had a weapon ? Congrats ! You got stabbed when really you should have gotten away.\n\nI think the good response was for the both of them to get away. Yelling in a mentally unstable man's face could have gotten really bad, tbh. I have been approached by weird homeless dudes before. You don't face them. You don't know if they are violent or have a knife or something. You get away and try not to provoke them.", "> \"I would say the exact same thing with the genders reversed!!\"\n\n- A bunch of people who would be making up a whole involved story about how OP probably provoked the homeless guy and it's not a woman's responsibility to put her boyfriend's safety over hers if the genders were reversed", "I'm a woman, and, having a husband, I would be unhappy if he didn't act in some way in a situation like this. I'm not saying he should beat the person up, escalate the situation, etc etc etc. But he wouldn't let go of my hand, because he'd be gently tugging it to urge me backward. He would then put himself in the middle.\n\nThis is not because of his cocknballs, but because we value protecting who we love. If he were my wife, this would be the same. If it were him being accosted, you can damn well bet I would be protecting him, even though I have a vagina.\n\nIt's not about gender roles. It's about wanting to feel safe and valued with your partner. \n\nThe boyfriend is not an AH for how he reacted. However, the girlfriend is not an AH for wanting her partner to act a certain way when shit hits the fan. It's an incompatibility, not a failing. Unfortunately, some compatibilities have to be experienced rather than discussed.", "Im a female and if my female friends ran off while I was getting attacked I would be pissed and SO WOULD YOU", "I don't think it was gonna be as witty as you think", "Nah OP didn\u2019t need him to defend her, but she needed him to not abandon her.", "Ah gotta love modern bull-shit like this", "Exactly, it's not about protecting you and being macho but recognizing that you're in a shitty situation and working through it with you.", "[removed]", "OP is NTA for her expectation. I don't want to judge the boyfriend but ... I (personally) think he can't be relied on to protect OP. *slight turnoff for me*", "Nowhere but lots of comments seem to assume that.", "I hate to tell you this, but when a man is screaming crazy shit at you an inch away from your face, a serious confrontation has already begun. And you\u2019re already in stabbing range. My goal would be to get me and my friend out of stabbing range of the crazy man as quickly as possible.\n\nNow you do what you want, but I\u2019m not just going to go running off down the sidewalk / into the street, praying the crazy man doesn\u2019t chase me and try to stab me. And if he does, praying I can outrun him. And I\u2019m not tryna bring my fists to a knife fight. I\u2019m going to throw the fear of God into that man that he has far more to fear from me than from whatever demons are in his head.", "You're telling it how it is, they are telling how they want it to be in their heads.. the best reaction is to try and get out of the situation. Trying to out crazy, crazy, isn't a great strategy.", "I think even friends would step in and try to protect the person from being attacked by a stranger.", "But you would also step between them", "Or he didn\u2019t want to escalate. There\u2019s a lot of nuance that we\u2019re not gonna get from this post. But you\u2019re right, cowardice isn\u2019t malicious.", "Long live feminism lol. Apparently woman can do anything, but when they actually have to fight their own battles their boyfriend has to step into danger for them\u2026 makes sense", "No, we aren't snowballing.  We are reacting to what she wrote.  The BFs reaction was to go immediately into a save-my-own-skin flight mode.  The OP froze.  That's exactly when a steady hand was needed to move her away from potential danger - when she couldn't move herself.  \n\nIt's clear the BF kept going and expected her to take care of herself.  What did he say when he walked back up to her?  Did he hold her and ask if she was okay?  No.  All he said was, \"Damn. That was crazy.\"", "Perhaps the chivalrous thing to do would be to keep hold of your partners hand and *run in the other fucking direction*, instead of leaving her to be assaulted by a random crazy man. \nYeesh, 90% of the men in these comments are single and it shows", "His strategy was doing nothing and that works perfectly well to de-escalate fights, but this wasn't a fight. \n\nOp was targeted as easy prey, de-escalation in these situations lets the instigator decide exactly how far it goes and when it stops with no worries of harm to themselves or consequences to pull them up. You de-escalate here and you're putting yourself at the mercy of someone whose actions have already proved they are unreasonable and nasty. The only good option is to escalate it right out of the sole control of the instigator and make them feel at risk too. That's why OP's strategy got results.", "I've never had a confrontation with a homeless man.   Have you?  \n\nIs that the only kind of social aggression you can think of?  No drunks, no AHs moving in on your wife or GF at a party, no hot-headed drivers, no bully pushing someone around, no jerk running a friend down in public?  Do you live in a cocoon?", "Don't be an idiot.  Did I say they or I were fighting bums?  I said confrontations.  FYI, since you seem so defensive, I've learned to stand my ground and defuse in the face of aggression.  I tried the other approsch and got punched out.  \n\nWhat I said was my GFs. wives and friends stood by me.  They didn't pretend they didn't know me.  Is that clear?  I can't do any better.  If you don't wish to understand the failure of the OP's BF, you won't", "Exactly. And like, while I know how I respond to the idea of someone being in my apartment (draw the knife I keep on me almost constantly, enter, and grab one of my better weapons before clearing every spot in the apartment), I'd be out of my league in a burning building and can only hope that I'd be able to help people, and at the minimum hope to not be someone that needs helped.", "You have a much better chance of blocking a blow with 2 hands than one. Also gives you 2 free hands if you decide to engage, which would be the worst choice they could've made: fighting a strange man with nothing to lose.", "The way they're attacking her is making me sick", "That's not a universal male point of view. I think it is very much a genderrole thing and i am woman. And he didn't bail. He stood next to her.", "He didn't stay back. He just dropped the hand. Something you might wouldn't even be doing with a female friend.", "Nah probs not", "Nothing to do with being a man. If you were with a girl friend, would she walk away and said nothing or would she've yelled *with* you? What would you have done?\n\nDo you think that maybe your bf thought that if, had he interfered, it would make you think that he thought you couldn't handle yourself and make him look sexist?\n\nYou need to ask him, being afraid of communication is not a great sign.", "Why not? You clearly have a problem with it and it\u2019s clear you do think it\u2019s his job to protect you so whether that\u2019s cause he\u2019s the man or not doesn\u2019t really make a difference anymore. So why not just discuss it?", "Is this the same boyfriend you mentioned two years back who's Muslim???", "Bot", "It's not like she tried to drop his hand to defend herself, she clearly wanted him to stay close. I suspect she doesn't know how to truly defend herself, but honestly, it sounds like he's clueless too. While I highly recommend all people learn some basic self-defense, it takes time to retrain your instincts, and unless you have training or have been in a lot of confrontations, I doubt this thought  would cross your mind and therefore I suspect the bf was preparing to flee, not trying to let the gf be prepared to fight.", "Exactly. I understand letting go of her hand, if you think it might turn physical you want your hands free. But to just stand there and watch! WTF, sounds more like an ex-partner", "NAH.\n\nFight, flight, or freeze applies to everyone. Your bf froze, which is a normal response that some people have to a high stress, threatening situation.", "To some extent, this is definitely about gender roles imo. I honestly feel like if the situation where reversed, there would b", "Not in my head, how it actually worked many times on public transit on my way to my job in the Tenderloin.

If he did it could just as well have escalated the situation though, that could have been what the dude were after in the first place. \n\nOP screaming at him seems to have worked, if another guy got involved there's a lot less social conditioning to overcome before it have the potential to turn violent.", "Most people would freeze like he did actually, most people can't handle confrontation.", "Definitely. Realistically the homeless guy is much more likely to get violent with a man than a woman so the bf stepping in could have made things worse.", "Just report and block u/Appropriate-Grande-64 for breaking rule 12. \nThat is the only way to deal with trolls.", "I've always found it funny that only actual \"incels\" - whatever the fuck you think you mean - use that word.", "Damm what is wrong with you people, the previous comment said it was him letting go of her hand for a sec. Enough time for a single sentence interaction to happen. Was maybe not exactly what we all think. And your response is to call him an incel, are you some kind of spastic in the brain?", "You're saying you aren't snowballing yet keep making the same presumption? Clearly there's something I'm missing about when you're saying he kept going, when all I read was that he let go of her hand.\n\nAnd people keep explaining what he could've done better, I've never claimed he handled it as well, hell maybe he got shocked aswell.", "Since you've hypothetically given this homeless gentleman a shank, funny thing about them: they put holes in men and women *pretty much* equally effectively.", "You are attributing an awful lot of deliberste practiced  strategy and careful consideration of just the right tactics to a man who kept walking, and could only manage to say \"Damn, that was crazy\" when it was over.  \n\nHe had a split second to react.  He had three choices.  Defend, freeze, or move away.  His lizard brain took over and made an \"I've never seen her before in my life\" move-away decision.  She needs to find a new lizard. I have tiny geckos in my garden who are more manly than this twerp.", "Okay, I think you might have misunderstood my comment since you came out so aggressive but I\u2019m not trying to be wise ass, I literally thought you meant that the women around you were getting into brawls along side you. I know what OP\u2019s boyfriend did was the wrong thing and I\u2019m not defending.", "Okay, hand holding or not they allowed it. Again, I respectfully disagree. We obviously have differing standards as to what constitutes poor behaviour from a partner or friend.", "Im sure you have been in a lot of fights and is always the heroic one. The one that steps in and defends the ones who cannot defend themselves. \n\nYou would never freeze in an altercation right?", "Freezing in the moment is one thing. Not makeing sure she's alright after is a major AH move.\n\nI mean \"that was crazy\"? Really?! What about \"Are you alright?\" Or even better \"sorry I didn't help, I panicked.\".", "But this person wasn't trapped in a train car...

Everyone is in such situations.  And everyone is afraid and full of adrenalin - that's instinctive.  \n\nThere is an implication that the BF moved away.  That is how his GF took it emotionally.  More importantly, he should have gotten in between her and the aggressive man.  He needn't have yelled or started punching.  He only had to move, and quickly.\n\nHis failure to ask if she were okay afterward is telling, don't you think?", "I actually gave the woman in the hypothetical couple a knife. \n\nMy point was that unless the woman has some other advantage, the man has a better chance than she does in a physical fight.", "Im bad at my phrasing, but I actually agree that his decision likely wasn't deliberate on his part. All these people who say he made a certain detailed careful consideration that was actually meant to best protect her, but I am saying that even if we follow that logic, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. \n\nYou are right that for most people, it is instinctive. So he let go, well okay then at least apologize for the fact that she didn't feel protected. Instead of all this mental gymnastics going \"actually it was a 4D chess move meant to protect you\". \n\nAnd not everything must be a fully logical calculation anyway\u2014 you know what would be logically in his best interest? If he let go and just legged it out of there by himself. But having your partner feel protected matters.", "My apologies.  Some of the comments on my comment have gotten me cranky.", "Of course anyone can freeze.\n\nBut why not acknowledge it and apologize to your partner. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I can\u2019t believe I just froze like that\u201d, for example.\n\nThat\u2019s how you acknowledge that you shouldn\u2019t help.\n\nBut I noticed that women tend to be more protective of the people they love than men, which is ironic, considering that men are traditionally known as \u201cprotectors\u201d, lol.", "Yes I've never been a coward in my entire life", "I love how you're saying this so sarcastically, as if you can't even imagine someone actually being like that.

Crazy is one thing. Wild uncontrollable beast is a whole other level.
