Your bf froze, which is a normal response that some people have to a high stress, threatening situation. I understand why you feel vulnerable and disappointed that your partner didn\u2019t help in the moment, but it\u2019s also unfair to hold it against him.

I think it's really unfair to blame him for freezing up, but you are forgiven & not the asshole in this situation unless you choose to hold this isolated incident over his head & continually deride him about it. It doesn't seem like you needed protecting. It seems like he stepped away & released your hand on instinct then if the hobo wouldn't back off or actually became violent with you I have faith that your bf would have stepped in. Soooo maybe he wasn't freezing up after all, he was just waiting for the hobo's next move.", "Damn yall really mean\n\nAnd some are sexist ngl \n\nNAH, he may have froze or gone into shock.

Yelling at the homeless man wasn't the correct answer. The correct answer is ignore and keep moving. \nI defend myself rather recklessly if something uncomfortable happens to me. When my gf is around, she makes sure I don't continue a confrontation. That is how she protects me. \n\nWhat you want is for your bf to put himself in harm's way to protect you, like a knight in shining armour. But your knight didn't have any armour or a sword as far as I know. You don't know if that man was armed. You don't know what that man was capable of. \nYou don't want to trigger this guy by yelling or punching him. Could have gotten both of you killed.", "NTA this isn't even a gender thing, if two female friends were walking and some dude creeped on one on them, the other one would have her back! I totally defend my friends", "If you think he should have protected you simply because he is a he, then YTA. If he let go of your hand as a conscious decision to distance himself from you, then NTA.

Clearly you had it in hand. And he probably just let go of you out of surprise.", "NAH. The letting go of the hand seems to be a sticking point for people, but if you are about to get into a physical conflict, holding someone\u2019s hand is a very vulnerable posture. You want both hands available to protect yourself or throw a punch. Him holding your hand doesn\u2019t protect you at all. Unless he ran away from you I would say NAH. You expected him to yell at the guy or hit him or something?", "So far NAH. Talk to each other. Talking will give both of you the opportunity to share your feelings and describe your respective experiences of the situation.", "Reading the title I was going to say Y T A but after reading the post I have to go with NAH .\n\nIt is unfair to expect someone to put themselves in danger without hesitation. He might be a man but beyond that he is a human being. He instinctively put himself out of harms way and then froze. This is a natural reaction. \n\nThat doesn't invalidate your own feelings after the fact. Even if you never thought about it before you had an expectation that someone you trust would help when you needed it (generally speaking, or maybe you think guys should white knight for you, I don't know). Well you needed it and he didn't help. There is probably a loss of trust. This is also natural. \n\nIn terms of solutions, there is the really obvious one: talk. Maybe he is stewing in his own shame and talking could help you both work through your emotions. Maybe he is an antifeminist who thinks that women's liberation means women should protect themselves if they don't want to go back to being barefoot and pregnant 24/7. I don't know.\n\nTo be clear talking may not help with the loss of trust and that is also okay. The point is to help you \"debrief\" or whatever the word the pros use is.", "Did you mean \u201cprojecting\u201d instead of \u201cprotecting\u201d in the judgement bot response?", "YTA. Didn't you get the memo from Feminism? It's sexist to think a man should protect a woman since women are stronger than men. Why are you trying to promote \"Toxic masculinity\"? Also, you should 've been able to fend off this homeless person just by expressing your feelings. What's next? Expecting him to change the tires if you get a flat? Unbelievable", "NTA, he witnessed it happen, yet he didn't do anything. You are not at fault here.", "NAH, although it's close for you. Without more information, it's hard to know why your BF \"didn't do anything\". He could have frozen up, which is one normal and natural reaction to being confronted, and wouldn't make him an asshole, simply someone not used to getting into fights (which is probably a good thing?). He could be fairly confident in a fight, and have let go of your hand because he wanted both his hands free. Not reacting and yelling back at the guy is deescalation; yelling back at a drunk guy who accosts you is how you make *sure* that you're gonna be in a fight.\n\nEither way, if someone posted this with the roles reversed and said they were upset that their GF didn't protect them the sub would not be ok with that; it is not ok this way around. Getting rid of gender roles and having equality, which I think is incredibly important, means getting rid of toxic female roles and expectations *and* toxic male roles and expectations, of which this is one.", "NAH\n\nYour boyfriend had a flight response instead of a fight response. \n\nBoth are valid reactions to fear.\n\nYou wanting him to defend you (I'm assuming he is bigger and stronger) is also a valid emotion.\n\nI'm a small woman myself and my response to seeing an altercation is to intervene and jump on in between. I've broken up and prevented fights in public with a lot of people standing around doing nothing. I don't get angry at the other bystanders who do nothing, no one can help their instinctive responses. \nI've seen some big burly dudes get hit in the face when they intervened and this has never happened to me. So your boyfriend might just have avoided getting a blue eye out bloody nose. My experience in general is that if a woman intervenes it just yells at someone to go away/pushes them away there is less likelihood of violence than when a man intervenes. \n\nAnyway, all that aside. Both your feelings and reactions are valid. Talk it over with each other, hash it out. Explain what you need from him in those situations, because knowing what your partner expects can lead to a change in reaction.", "NTA. I am afraid for you for when a similar situation happens in the future. If he can\u2019t react in any way to help/protect you WHILE HE IS THERE, how can you count on him for when something happened and you are by yourself? He also didn\u2019t even ask if you were okay. I would reconsider this relationship or think about other times he has acted like this.", "NTA. At it's core, he should have AT THE VERY LEAST got between you two, even if he didn't say anything.

If he doesn't want to discuss it, or work on his future responses, it will be time to let him go.", "~~~INFO What did you think your boyfriend should do?

My partner swooped round to get in between whilst telling him \"have a good day mate\" and just guided us away. It happened quickly, so he didn't have time to get angry, react badly etc. I would have been gutted and honestly disgusted if he had walked off and left us to deal with it.

For all we know, she could have panicked and frozen when confronted by the homeless man, and in that case, i think the bf would have some right to be upset, because I would expect anyone walking in a city with me to be aware enough to keep moving or discuss before hand if they're inexperienced/need extra help to navigate.", ">So, he let go of her hand \"to be prepared for a confrontation\" but he didn't yell at the homeless man?\n\nYes, because him yelling would have been an active escalation on his part. You seem to be obviously clueless about the male dynamics at play here. His strategy was the one most likely getting everyone, including himself, out unharmed.  \n\nHis life isn't worth less, he does not need to get himself preemptively shanked as you put it. His life is not a health bar extension of his girlfriend. She is not more deserving of a life free from physical harm than him because of her gender.", "Or he doesn't like how it went down and is ashamed", "It put them both in better positions to defend each other if necessary. \n\nThe guy could\u2019ve been thinking, well I better get ready to square up, or we better get ready to run, or he just panicked and dropped her hand in response. \n\nWho knows. OP should probably ask him why he did it, because consulting people online who can\u2019t ask him and are just assuming or guessing is definitely not a good way to clarify that and most people here are just going to tell her that it\u2019s some horrible red flag and she should leave him for that momentary reaction lol.. \n\nIf it actually was a cowardly move and he was about to just ditch her there though, i don\u2019t know how I could respect him after that, and I\u2019m sure that would make a relationship pretty difficult for anybody involved in that situation regardless of conditioning or gender norms or whatever.", "I mentioned this in another comment, but it really is crazy the number of people here focusing on letting go of her hand. I don't get how on earth freeing up a combined two hands doesn't put BOTH of them in a better position to defend themselves if needed, I can't imagine what people expected would've been different had he continues holding it?", "Then why didn\u2019t he check in on her after? Instead made a brief comment and moved one", "Youre really grasping at straws here", "[removed]", "They really are! I hope it doesn\u2019t skew OP\u2019s view.", "I have considered your opinion and I respectfully disagree. I understand it being gendered in that she\u2019s \u201cless attracted\u201d to him, but I\u2019m more coming from a view of the partner acting poorly as a human being regardless of gender.

He wasn\u2019t letting go to help. \n\nTake your incel opinions elsewhere please babe", "I did assume she kept walking, but yeah it would be annoying if she froze. \n\nI don't think it has to be a huge apology, just that most people know it feels bad if they are being accosted and their partner just lets go and seems to fuck off, so if you are the partner who did that, at least apologize for not seeming like you cared, is how I think. What he said afterwards (\"wow wasn't that crazy haha\") seemed too dismissive. \n\nI realize the original comment made it seem like I was advocating that he yells back, but that's only because people said he was \"readying himself\". I don't see the point of that in my personal opinion, just hold her and keep walking, if she gets injured, it takes just half a second to let go of her hand. And tbh, at then do what? It is also a bad idea to try using your fists on a guy with a knife. The answer is still to try to grab her and run away anyway.", "Of course his life isn't worth less. But if it had come down to a physical confrontation, he most likely would have stood a much better chance than she would. \n\nNow, if she was armed and knew how to use her weapon effectively or trained in some kind of martial arts, that could be reversed. But in general, all other things being equal, men are just physically stronger. Not worth less. It's just more likely if there is a fight that both victims survive if he's the one in it.", "He could still hold her hand, letting go makes her feel that he doesn't care (which is clear to anyone with bare minimum social skills). If he had no plans to yell, why did he let go? In what world is \"let go of her hand and then do nothing and pretend to see none of it\" the way which is \"most likely to get everyone out of it unharmed\" when the top comments echo that he could hold onto her and walk faster? It seems like he chose the best way to get everyone out of it unharmed, but added the shit cherry on top where he let go of her and that looks uncaring and insensitive. \n\nIt is really weird to see people type \"he let go to be ready for a confrontation \" and then backtrack with \"but he could not do anything because that would make things worse\". So a. What exactly was he waiting for, when he was supposedly reading himself for confrontation (actual physical injury?) and b. What does the \"confrontation\" in \"readying himself for confrontation\" entail if he cannot yell? \n\nI know there is the chance that he was genuinely scared and that wouldn't be his fault, but it is strange to see the take that letting go of her is some strange calculated benevolent move", "If they kept their hands together, they could have used their linked arms as a tripwire! They\u2019ll never see it coming!", "There's nothing in the post to suggest he too wasn't shaking just like OP on the inside. The mind blanking out in such times is pretty common.\n\nWeak minded is the closest label I'd say for him, but he probably might not have experienced such confrontation at all till now, but again doesn't make him the AH for not knowing how to act, obviously couldn't predict the situation and given he didn't cause it, there's no sensible reason to make him an AH here.", ">Guy is a coward.
