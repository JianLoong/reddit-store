You've done nothing wrong.", "NTA - Charlie discarded his daughter to marry his wife which makes him a complete asshole. Derek stepped in and basically became her father and made sure that his partner and Kaia got along. He's been raising a child that isn't his. I feel he deserves it more than Charlie.

It's even more telling that he ditched his own daughter for his shiny new wife.\n\nI'm glad Kaia gets along with Derek and that he is willing to care for his niece like this.  It's extremely noble of him.  But many women walked out of a relationship with him because of her.  I'm glad his partner is willing to get along with Kaia and be a stepmom unlike other women he has met before her, but that shouldn't be Derek's problem, it should be Charlie's.

Like I understand not liking your step mom but the fact that she was preventing the uncle who stepped up for her from having girlfriends is messed up. Why does Kaia, a literal teenager, have so much involvement in the relationships of the adults around her? Why is Kaia\u2019s approval the end all be all? \nYou suck for playing favorites and possibly enabling Kaia\u2019s behavior. \nIf you told Charlie you weren\u2019t paying for his wedding because he left the responsibility of father onto his brother then maybe you would suck less.", "Info - well, why dont you approve of Derek\u2019s marriage?", "The Kaia issue is a red herring.

You said that you didn't pay for Charlie's wedding because they forced Kaia out.
