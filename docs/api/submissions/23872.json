It's about being present and active in the child's life.", "No he is not. They have money", "He was there when I said it. I don't think I need to hide anything I want to do with my money", "Are you really writing that out and not seeing it?", "Does \"discard\" really have to be so literal as to mean that he actively packed her off to live elsewhere? Given the fact that Derek has been through a number of failed relationships over the time he's been raising Kaia it's unlikely that Kaia hopped on a bus a few weeks ago to go live with her uncle. It's very likely she was packed off, maybe all at once or maybe piecemeal, to live elsewhere.\n\nCharlie discarded her feelings in favour of his girlfriend/now wife's happiness, does that count as discarding her? He discarded his responsibility to parent and left her to be taken in by her uncle, does it count yet? \n\nHe is 100% responsible for the fact that she hasn't grown up in her father's home, I'd call that discarding her no matter the logistics of \"Kaia not going there as much.\"", "Well now you won\u2019t be able to see the other child.", "Since dad walked away BEFORE new baby.. ur math isn't mathing.\nKaia is 15 NOW but was not back then.\nOP does not care for Charlie's wife either so there is more than that. Dads wife didn't like to stepdaughter and vice versa and dad picked wife over daughter.\nUncle stepped into dad role and when gfs were bothered that he basically had a kid without having a kid he stood by kid.  Present fiancee accepts Kaia as Uncles child and is sweet so OP likes her.\n\nKaia may be a smart-ass esp at 15 and prob sassy forever but she is also a kid whose dad turned his back on her and was blessed rest of family didn't", "I've read all of OP's comments and didn't see anything to indicate that dad walked away before his new wife had a kid, and nothing is said about Kaia's mother except a vague sentence at the beginning saying Kaia started to spend less time at Charlie's. In fact, the only mention I saw that there was a new kid was one vague comment from OP, and that didn't specify when dad walked away: before or after baby. Also, it doesn't sound like dad walked away at all; it sounds like Kaia walked away. At any rate, OP is the AH here.", "Does he seem to care at all that his relationship with his daughter is so strained?", "Derek could afford the wedding easily with all the money he has spent on Kaia. \n\nCharlie dumped his kid for his wife. There is no reward for that behavior! \n\nAsk him if he wants to go on a trip, just him and Kaia. Tell him you will pay for it. When he says no, or tries to get his wife invited (okay, but I will pay for wife to go so i don't have to spend real time binding with my daughter) tell him that is why I didn't pay for your wedding! Because you don't value your family. \n\nCan you imagine how hurt and lost Kaia would be without Derek? I'm glad you ate doing something wonderful for him! He should be reminded that he is wonderful, and his new wife, angelically wonderful!!\n\nYou are wonderful too! Nta", "Kaia has a mother out there; if Charlie were paying child support it would be to the mother who is co-raising Kaia. Kaia is also staying at her dad's, just less because she is also staying at her uncle's. This is all in the post. Kaia has 3 places she stays and would have 4 if OP let her stay with him.", "And Kaia has a mother, too. OP is leaving a LOT of info out that he trickles into his comments.", "NTA", "\\- her mother is probably dead or ran off (no mention of her in post)\n\n\\- her father threw her away and preferred to get a new wife\n\n\\- it is only a matter of time before someone else comes into her guardian's life and makes her uproot her home, stability and self of safety, worth, etc.\n\nthe fact that she gets long great with this new person, and they are happy as a unit now goes to show that the kid was hurting and lashing out but mostly from FEAR. Totally understandable.", "She is a normal teenager with abandonment issues which are completely understandable. Her father didn\u2019t love her and happily threw her away to get a new girlfriend. What do you think a teenage brain would think that means when her uncle brings home dates?", "The other child will never know how lucky they are!", "I mean she was kicked out because of her stepmom and is probably afraid of that happening again.", "And you're the one who raised him that way", "Where is Kaia's mother? Why isn't she staying with her?", "curious\u2026 what is your problem with charlie\u2019s marriage that you disapprove of ?  nta and i think you can pay for whatever you feel comfortable with and it isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s business.", "i'm confused, if Kaia is Charlie's daughter, how was she cock blocking Derek? She isn't Derek's daughter right? i'm so confused how Derek's niece was ruining his relationships.", "Yeah, and what do you want to bet that Charlie hasn't been paying child support to Derek either? \n\nTell Charlie he's been getting his daughter raised for free, and this is just your way of evening things up a little.\n\nNTA", "Nah, shitty parenting is letting your new boo kick your actual child out of your house, picking that person over your child repeatedly, then throwing a tantrum when the grandparent of the emotionally abused teenager doesn\u2019t pay for your wedding (to the person that kicked your child out of her own home. Which is something you\u2019re supes chill about). \n\nFfs", "Probably because of the kids underlying abandonment issues and maybe possibly due to her situation with her mother.  There are tons of reasons why a 15 year old girl might be hard to get along with, most of them do not make her the asshole though some could.  It really depends on why they didn\u2019t get along and in what way they didn\u2019t get along.", "Query - does Charlie pay child support to Derek?\n\nNTA. But he totally should.", "At one point, I read through the replies OP have made.\n\nThere was noting definitive.  He is angry that father let daughter move in uncle and blames the new wife.\n\nJust as a new spouse to a step child can be horrible, a child can be horrible to a potential spouse to the their parent.\n\nOP has failed to elaborate.   \n\nI really have no idea why the father allowed, or perhaps encouraged his daughter to move out, but I am not willing to condemn on one side or the other.", "Agree with no mention of mom but OP said K went to live at Derek's so... \nAnd exactly issues could well be from before baby \nA kid under 15 since she is now 15 doesn't walk away, parent gives up", "Care to give an example of Kaia\u2019s \u2018maladjusted\u2019 personality? Or are you making huge leaps. About a child. Who\u2019s been rejected and ejected by her father. Whose mother doesn\u2019t seem to be anywhere. Who\u2019s basically been abandoned. Please, do tell us all the horrible things this kid has done and why it\u2019s definitely all on her, the child", "No, no it was not her responsibility or her fault. You need to stop putting the blame on this woman because Kaia was never her responsibility. Kaia was your son's responsibility and it was HIS job to make sure she was comfortable and HIS fault that Kaia left, no matter who was truly \"right\" or \"wrong\" in the arguments. If it was his daughter then it was his responsibility to correct the behavior, if it was his partner then it was his job to protect his daughter. Your son made choices and even if his wife is straight up the devil it was still his choice to side with her over his daughter. Your anger is going to the wrong place because basically abandoning his daughter is 100% on your son, HE was her parent. \n\nThat being said, I honestly can't tell who else is or isn't the AH without more details on the disputes between Kaia and your son's wife. What did they argue about? What happened when they argued? Also... How old was Kaia during these arguments? These are important details because if Kaia chose to live with her uncle solely because he lets her get away with more then he's (Kaia's father) still an AH for not trying harder, but the rest of the family also for letting this kid get away with being a brat. However this plays out though you need to accept that your son is an AH and stop talking like his wife is some kind of siren and he had no choice. He had choices and he made them. Stop trying to blame somebody else for your son's failures as a parent."]}
