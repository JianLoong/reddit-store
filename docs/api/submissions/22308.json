I allowed him to live with me and my kids and my dad (yes, my dad lives with me also ever since my mom died) to get back on his feet. He left and ended up in jail after threatening one of his baby mamas. My dad and I sent him money when in jail for things like soap, etc. He got out of jail and became homeless again so I bought him a plane ticket to my city to help him, again. I let him live at my house for months and helped him get a job, told him he needed to give me his paychecks so I could save his money for him (because he spends and never saves), so he'd have enough money to get his own place. He got a job, never gave me his earnings. Then he started being mean to my kids, aggressive to me. Found out he was drinking and was a mean alcoholic.  He ended up getting mad at me for asking him to turn down music after 9pm and slashed my car tire, told me if I don't beat my son's ass he would, stole money from my kids' piggybanks, and more so I kicked him out. He got a place and has been fine for a few months. He recently got a girlfriend and she stole his money and his vehicle (which is my dad's) and because he couldn't get to work, he is now losing his job and his place. He and my dad expect me to take him in again, and I just don't want to.

Not only should you not allow him to live with you, you should\u2019ve reported his behavior to the police and had him arrested. Then he would have a place to sleep.", "NTA. He slashed your car tires (this is crazy) and stole your kids' piggybank money, that's low. And he threatened to hurt your kids. He's also mean.\n\nIf you're financially supporting your dad, and it's your home, your dad doesn't get a say. If your dad insists, you can tell your dad that he is welcome to move out to live with your brother. But if it's your dad's house and you're being supported by your dad then your dad can do anything he wants, but living with the brother wouldn't be safe so you should move out with your kids.", "NTA 100x over. You have minor children at your house and your brother is a threat to them (and you) when abusing substances. You have no real reason to believe he\u2019s sober or better now, and thus no real reason to believe he\u2019s grown enough to treat family well and not be a liability at best and a danger at worst.", "Heck no. NTA. You helped him before and he\u2019s only ever burned you. You have to protect yourself and your family.", "NTA, if dad wants to help him out he can go live at the brothers place. There's room and he can drive him to work. Win-win", "NTA you can't sacrifice your own sanity or the safety of your kids just to accommodate your brother. Sounds like he made a series of poor decisions and is having to deal with the consequences. If you help you're just going to enable the same behavior from him and he won't change because he'll always know he has you to fall back on.", "NTA Do not under any circumstances let that man in your home even for a visit!", "NTA\n\nYour kids deserve to have a more stable environment than having an addict constantly moving in and out of the household.", "NTA- your primary responsibility is to your kids and their safety. Your brother has burned through his chances. Make sure to make that clear to your father in no uncertain terms, and if your dad tries to overrule you on this, he can move out and get a place with your brother.", "Your kids are your first priority and he is a danger to them. \n\nNTA", "NTA, you and your children\u2019s safety has to come 1st. Honestly at this point you would be TA if you allowed it. If your dad has a problem with it tell him he can go with your brother. Your children have to be your 1st priority. He should have been kicked out and never aloud to return the 1st time he got aggressive with your children.", "NTA. You are putting your kids through hell. Your brother is an adult and can suffer his own consequences. You and dad are both enabling him.", "One of my favorite sayings: May the bridges I burn light my way.  \n\nThat, and: If I wasn't here,  what would you do? \n\nNTA", "Nta you need to protect your own kids not your brother at this point. He has already threatened to hurt your child-don\u2019t let him by inviting him back into your home. Your priority are your children- always keep that in mind. You gave him plenty of chances and he squandered your help. Don\u2019t let his emotional manipulative win, protect your kids.", "NTA. He has already burned his bridge. Your kids are your first priority and living with an addict can be unstable and unsafe.", "NTA. If you let him back, you\u2019re teaching your children that their safety and peace does not matter.", "Picture yourself in a CPS investigation after your active addict brother hurts one of your kids and the hospital reports the injury. Are you an asshole for not letting him live with you or for letting him live with you? The answer seems clear to me. Protect your children and let your brother sort himself out.", "NTA. You would be if you let him in. He was aggressive to your kids, that's enough to never let him in the house again, beyond that he actively threatened to beat your kid and slashed your tires. He shouldn't be allowed on the street you live on let alone in your house.\n\nMake it extremely clear to your dad what he's done and that if your dad starts pressuring you or lets him in himself then your dad will be looking for his own place as well.\n\nAt some point being family isn't enough, and that point is where he's a threat to your family which he's demonstrated he is.", "NTA. But sounds like your dad is ready to spread his wings too and would make an excellent roommate to your brother his son. Win win!", "NTA - it's time to stop bailing him out of trouble.  He's a grown man who has to take responsibility of himself.  You have a responsibility to your children.\n\nIf your father wants to help him so badly, they can move out and find a place together.", "NTA.... he burned bridges and can't expect to treat you and your kids like shit and then just saunter back in like nothing ever happened. Tell him he made his bed and now he has to sleep in it.... seems like he takes zero responsibility for things.", "NTA. Even if he did somehow sober up in those few months he was on his own, he still got to learn to make better decisions and not be a victim. Not giving your girlfriend access to all your money, and maybe just maybe calling the police when somebody takes a car that doesn't even belong to you in the first place would be a start.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
