He ended up getting mad at me for asking him to turn down music after 9pm and slashed my car tire, told me if I don't beat my son's ass he would, stole money from my kids' piggybanks, and more so I kicked him out.

If your dad insists, you can tell your dad that he is welcome to move out to live with your brother.

You have minor children at your house and your brother is a threat to them (and you) when abusing substances.

There's room and he can drive him to work. Win-win", "NTA you can't sacrifice your own sanity or the safety of your kids just to accommodate your brother.

You have a responsibility to your children.\n\nIf your father wants to help him so badly, they can move out and find a place together.", "NTA.... he burned bridges and can't expect to treat you and your kids like shit and then just saunter back in like nothing ever happened. Tell him he made his bed and now he has to sleep in it.... seems like he takes zero responsibility for things.", "NTA. Even if he did somehow sober up in those few months he was on his own, he still got to learn to make better decisions and not be a victim.

Don't ever let him live with you. You have kids depending on you, and he has so many strikes against him I'd have to quote your whole post to list them all. He's an adult and not your responsibility, and he's already been aggressive: leave him the hell alone and don't help him any more. Go completely non-contact if possible, and get a restraining order if necessary.   \nIncidentally, his GF probably didn't steal anything: he sold it for drugs and lied, which is all he will do with absolutely anything he can reach.", "Nope nope nope. You seen how he appreciated your support and help last time he lived there. Nothing has changed. My brother is the same but maybe a little worse. He was getting kicked out and asked if he could stay with me. Fuck that noise. He has used and abused me for so long and even though my Dad wanted me to let him live here, I had to explain to him that he is a liar and a thief due to his addictions.
