We got engaged in January and have been planning our wedding for 2024. We plan to get married on our 6 year anniversary. It\u2019s a date that all the most important people in our life have available and it also just means so much to us.\n\nMy brother, Mark (25M) has been dating his girlfriend, Iris (24F) since September of 2022. They have moved pretty quickly, moving in together already and seriously discussing the future. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with this, just again setting the stage here a bit.\nWhen I mentioned to Iris my wedding date, she got a little weirded out and said \u201cThat\u2019s our 2 year\u201d. I pointed out that their anniversary is 2 weeks prior to mine and Ella\u2019s. She acted like she was fine with.\n\nAs we\u2019re still a little far out, not much planning has been done outside booking the venue. However, I have subscribed to a few bridal magazines, just to get ideas. Ella and I are big \u201cdream board\u201d people, so it\u2019s fun for us to try to figure out exactly what we want.\nMark and Iris came over on Sunday. She spotted the magazines and began flipping through one. Iris kept making comments saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be in town that week (meaning my wedding)\u201d. Mark said they would be. Iris asked \u201cDon\u2019t you want to do something special for our anniversary?\u201d Again, we all pointed out that their anniversary is 2 weeks before mine and Ella\u2019s. Unless they plan some luxury vacation, they\u2019re going to be back in time.\n\nIris then turned to me and said \u201cIf Mark proposes to me within the next year, we\u2019ll be getting married on our anniversary. It\u2019ll be hard for the families to come up for 2 weddings in 1 month\u201d.\nMark and I attended the same university, a good amount of distance away from our hometown. Most of our family still lives there. They all plan to come to my wedding.\n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t really feel threatened by this, which I know is what Iris wanted. I simply smiled and said \u201cIf you\u2019re still together, then we\u2019ll see how that pans out.\u201d Iris sat up straight and asked \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d I said \u201cHoney, you\u2019ve been together 7 months. Not saying you can\u2019t know he\u2019s the one, but I\u2019m not going to change the date for someone who may not even be around next year.\u201d\n\nIris got very quiet and didn\u2019t speak for a half hour. The conversation shifted to something else. Eventually, she got up and said she was going outside to smoke. Mark got a text not long after and went outside. Ella and I could hear arguing. Mark came back in and said that Ella was leaving. I understood why.\nIris, however, has texted me several times saying I\u2019m invalidating her and Mark\u2019s relationship. Mark has said while he understands my point, I didn\u2019t have to say that.
