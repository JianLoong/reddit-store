I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with this, just again setting the stage here a bit.\nWhen I mentioned to Iris my wedding date, she got a little weirded out and said \u201cThat\u2019s our 2 year\u201d. I pointed out that their anniversary is 2 weeks prior to mine and Ella\u2019s.

It\u2019ll be hard for the families to come up for 2 weddings in 1 month\u201d.\nMark and I attended the same university, a good amount of distance away from our hometown. Most of our family still lives there. They all plan to come to my wedding.\n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t really feel threatened by this, which I know is what Iris wanted. I simply smiled and said \u201cIf you\u2019re still together, then we\u2019ll see how that pans out.\u201d Iris sat up straight and asked \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d I said \u201cHoney, you\u2019ve been together 7 months. Not saying you can\u2019t know he\u2019s the one, but I\u2019m not going to change the date for someone who may not even be around next year.\u201d\n\nIris got very quiet and didn\u2019t speak for a half hour. The conversation shifted to something else. Eventually, she got up and said she was going outside to smoke. Mark got a text not long after and went outside. Ella and I could hear arguing. Mark came back in and said that Ella was leaving. I understood why.\nIris, however, has texted me several times saying I\u2019m invalidating her and Mark\u2019s relationship.
