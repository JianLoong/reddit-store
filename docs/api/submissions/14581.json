It\u2019ll be hard for the families to come up for 2 weddings in 1 month\u201d.\nMark and I attended the same university, a good amount of distance away from our hometown.

Not saying you can\u2019t know he\u2019s the one, but I\u2019m not going to change the date for someone who may not even be around next year.\u201d\n\nIris got very quiet and didn\u2019t speak for a half hour. The conversation shifted to something else. Eventually, she got up and said she was going outside to smoke. Mark got a text not long after and went outside. Ella and I could hear arguing. Mark came back in and said that Ella was leaving. I understood why.\nIris, however, has texted me several times saying I\u2019m invalidating her and Mark\u2019s relationship.

I would be absolutely pissed if someone said something like this to me or my wife at that time. Especially someone that seems to have a history of thinking their relationship is somehow superior to mine. An easy way to get the same point across without calling the validity of their relationship into question would just be to reply with a 'Let's wait and see what happens.' but OP just had to throw a jab in there and even doubled down when seeing Iris was offended.
