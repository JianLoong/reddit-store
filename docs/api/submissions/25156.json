That just stood out to me, along with theories of Emma possibly complaining to Chris, explaining his drunken angry texts. Chris isn't a very good friend to blow up at you like that without hearing your side, regardless of how many years you've known him. I'd be wary of Emma too. I've cut out a few friends even knowing them for almost ten years because they turned out to be manipulators. Time spent on a friendship doesn't always equate to a trustworthy friendship. \n\nOf course, I don't know your friends or yourself personally so I'm just adding to the pile of theories.

Therefore regardless of the friendship, Emma wants to make very sure you are not close friends after the marriage so you are not a potential threat. Nothing does that like setting you up so she can make herself seem reasonable. Chris sounds like a putz if he fell for it without telling you but do not get caught up in her game. \n\nEither (1) meet in person with both of them to explain what happened and show Chris Emma\u2019s links to the dresses and correspondence on hen party invites sp they have a chance to apologise or (2) skip out politely on the wedding and cut ties with both of them.\n\nEither way NTA", "It could be from the stress of planning the wedding.  Emma is overwhelmed and is looking for an outlet.  \n\nChris also might\u2019ve been ignoring her complaints until your name came up.  That caught his attention and Emma leaned in and started to exaggerate because was listening.  \n\nI have an ex-bestie like this.  Honestly, she was the nicest person to your face but would talk behind people backs constantly due to her own social anxiety. I didn\u2019t see it coming until she turned her disdain on my bf after a disagreement. She turned on me when I wouldn\u2019t take her side against him.", "I had a friend like this. Her 'being nice' caused a lot more grief and drama (as it was causing fights and then we found out she was telling everyone different things) than if she was just honest.", "Abuse is abuse - alcohol or not. I'll definitely a) pull out of the wedding b) be direct and use \"I feel statements c) if  it feels right, you can genuinely wish them well, give a gift/money etc. But the swearing and horrible tone of that text would end it.", "Whoa, nowhere in the being a bridesmaid handbook does it include covering the cost of the wedding?

Personally I would screen shot all of the conversations and send them back with a note saying that you only did as requested and don\u2019t appreciate the negativity you are receiving for your support and feel as though the two of them clearly have some issues or frustrations that they are taking out on you and so you are going to step back from both the wedding and them. Let them know that you are returning all of the dresses and have uninvited your friends from her hen do and also won\u2019t be in attendance. And that you won\u2019t be providing any financial contribution but wish them the best. And then I would step the fuck back from these friendships.", "It\u2019s Emma causing this. He said he is \u2018hearing\u2019 what you\u2019ve done.. from HER. She\u2019s lying about or manipulating the situation.

It doesn\u2019t even matter why. She\u2019s manipulating you both - you don\u2019t accidentally say these things.\n\nI\u2019d step away from this - the audacity of them to use your time, effort and money then throw this bs at you? No, not acceptable, no good excuse for the nastiness.

Although I can't see this working out in your favour judging by their initial reactions to the situation", "Honestly, I doubt emma will tell you the truth of what\u2019s going on because that blow up wouldn\u2019t have come out of nowhere. Just bow out respectfully. Say you\u2019ve only done what\u2019s asked and it\u2019s super disrespectful to get such a message.", "I would back out and tell them both why. If they start their crap block them both and consider it case closed. \nThere\u2019s too many yikes here and I think it\u2019s a better idea to step out and be civil than continue this close friendship.", "NTA.

Based on the info you've provided in the comments, you're friends with both of them and have been for 5 years. Sit down with them together, go over the events from your point of view, and listen to what they have to say. Don't get emotional, just go over the facts and try to see where it all fell apart. It may be something you guys can move past with an open discussion. \n\nIf they are ungrateful and disrespect you again during this convo, then back out of the wedding. Politely, but firmly draw a line under it so it doesn't drag on.", "This is the way - meet with them both face to face.\n\nUnless you speak to both of them at the \\*same time\\* you will not know if one person has stirred up trouble for you or if it is just a genuine misunderstanding.", "You never really know what's going on in another relationship, and there's something weird happening here for sure!\n\nBut you have put yourself at wild financial risk by ordering so many dresses with the plan (\ud83e\udd1e) to return them.\n\nI'd just return all the dresses and step away from the whole thing.\n\nEven if you're still cool with her, that's a shit-ton of hostility to put up with from the groom. I wouldn't get near that dude on his wedding day.", "That's absolutely not normal.   Do not pass go, do not pay $200 to attend a wedding.\n\nI think you should (as other commenters have said) share Chris's comments with Emma, and tell her you're stepping down, and hand off all plans to her.  And send to Chris all the texts which show she agreed to what you did.\n\n\nReturn all the dresses and get refunds for any outlay.\n\nThen take some space from them.\n\nIt sounds like they can't afford the wedding and are frantic about costs.

That's not normal.", "It's possible she's been complaining right along and that night he finally snapped.", "Is it possible she wanted you to pick one dress and sent you some options, and was upset you spent so much money ordering so many dresses?  Most people will pick what they want before they order.  Did she actually say she wanted you to order them all, or just what do you think of these?\n\nWhen I was planning my wedding I sent my bridesmaids a bunch of dresses, and I was mostly looking for feedback if they liked them, I would never have thought for a second they would just order them all.", "Also, don't feel bad if this causes a rift. It's always better to have things out in the open. Especially if she's been pushing more of his friends away.", "Yeah, I can see OP having ordered multiple of her favorites of those dresses to see what they looked like on her before deciding and returning the rest immediately but like... \"I'm not sure how they'll fit so I'm ordering 3,4 and 7 to see which looks best on me, do you want to see pictures of me in the dresses and give any input on which you'd prefer? Do you have any preference between those three right now that I should keep in mind?\" would be kinda okay, but all seven and making the bride decide? Ehhh. If the bride wanted to decide she would have given you a link to one dress. Don't put things on the bride that she's asked you to handle.", "Another commenter mentioned this and I'm not sure if you've covered this, but are either of the women Emma doesn't know an ex-fling of Chris? I could see him thinking you're trying to have a dramatic hen do if he's slept with other attendees. Is your dynamic sometimes practical jokes? Is it possible that he's seeing a possible derailment in the name of a \"never have I ever slept with Chris?\" moment where Emma is blindsided?", "Return the dresses, cancel the hens and decline to be in the wedding. You could offer to sit down with BOTH in person to hash out the conflict, but you\u2019re not obligated. NTA.", "I'm so confused by everyone saying back out and cut them off immediately. Like, what?\n\nClearly, OP, Emma hasn't been totally straight with you about what she wanted. But it may be just little differences. Like if I were a person planning a low-key elopement and truly wanted the bridesmaid to just pick something, I might send inspo, but I would think ordering 7 dresses to return is way, way too much. Like just order one dress out of the options and move on, and for goodness sakes, stop asking me about dresses. \n\nYou seem to be people-pleasing her to a high degree and she seems to be ambivalent and low key. And maybe looking for a more decisive person to step in and plan something where she feels inadequate. \n\nThe thing with the hens is weird for sure. It is weird that she would want a group that she doesn't know. There's also a mismatch between what 39 year olds want and what 29 year olds want, usually. You need to get more clear about what went wrong there.\n\nLook, you have put so much effort in on this. And you're resenting the effort you put. But you also have found out that you've put effort in things she doesn't want or care much about. And you've gone out of her comfort zone, and she doesn't want to tell you to your face. There's a big mismatch in energy here.\n\nBut, like, talk to them. Chris definitely owes you an apology for drunkenly berating you. But you also need to listen to your friends.\n\nAlso, do NOT screenshot and send messages. It does not make you look right, it just looks petty. A conversation where you say, hey, \"I was confused about what you wanted so I tried to do everything to make you happy\" and \"I thought you wanted something, and I tried to do it the way we talked about, but maybe you didn't feel safe telling me what you actually want?\" is going to go over so much better, and then really listening. \n\nYou've become aware in a pretty dramatic way that you're missing something. So you can either be defensive and put up walls and shut people out, in which case you will feel sad and lonely and she will too, or you can try to work towards a resolution. That resolution can be that you don't plan things for her anymore, but it could also be repair.", "Tbh I would put the two of them in a chat group with you and post all the messages between you and her regarding organising dresses and hens and the messages he sent you. I would sign it off by saying you\u2019re not doing separate chats with them both because it then becomes a he said/she said with bride and groom denying everything. Then tell them they have 24 hours to sort it out between them and get back to you with an apology or you are going to return everything you have paid for. This kind of bs is not worth the effort.", "perhaps emma felt scared to admit she didn\u2019t like some things,\nI personally would maybe ask Emma out for a coffee and say how you are feeling, ask her straight up what the texts were about and if she really felt that way. \nI probably would bow out of being a bridesmaid anyway because why would a friend text you like that, even if i was in your situation and my friend needed to let me know his future wife wasn\u2019t liking some of the things but was shy to say that doesn\u2019t mean you talk like that.", "NTA. I usually don't write any comments on Reddit but OP, you're such a sweet lady and you don't deserve this. Please, please get yourself out of this wedding and let them figure out the things for themselves.", "Op pleas wake up! She\u2019s using you and playing both sides.

I'd back off alright - all the way off.  You've gone WAY beyond anything I would have done to make Emma happy.

Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself.", "Frankly, I don't think you should burn this relationship down when Emma, herself hasn't done anything wrong that we know of. Chris is the one being hostel and attacking the OP.  It is totally fair to say you don't want to stay in the wedding when the groom has been so threatening - but let's not automatically assume a woman is the cause of Chris's bad behavior.  A lot of people are staying 'oh she must be complaining a lot to make him act this way' but all we know for sure is that Chis is being a asshole and i am not going to just hand wave a dude's bad behavior away on the assumption that his girlfriend drove him to act that way.", "This, at least one or both of them are lying/overacting, doesn\u2019t matter who, just back out if you\u2019re uncomfortable. You shouldn\u2019t suffer for their miscommunication be it on purpose or not. NTA.", "How do we know that Emma lied and this isn't a case of Chris hugely overreacting to whatever information she provided. For all we know Emma said \"Hey, OP set everything up. She invited these two people I don't know, I hope we get along.\"", "She knows exactly what was said. She\u2019s doing damage control because she\u2019s worried about losing your financial help with the wedding.\n\nCut your losses and write them both off.\n\nI don\u2019t care how much someone has to drink, a true friend does not treat their friends the way Chris treated you.\n\nDon\u2019t be their sucker and piggy bank.\n\nNTA", "Your heart is in the right place, but you can't be a buffer to their communication (or lack thereof). If revealing the truth is going to \"pin them against each other,\" they have bigger problems.", "I think this is a sign of cut and run now.\n\nThe last thing you need to be is a focal point for any issues for their elopement.", "It seems she is already pretty stressed out about being the bridesmaid though.  Why hasn't Emma cleared the air yet?  While Emma isn't responsible for Chris' behavior she was the point of contention.  She can still be Emma's friend without entangling with their weird dynamic.   \n\n\nI wonder why Emma didnt offer to clear the air.  I'm assuming Chris showed her the messages.  \"Chris spoke out of turn, I do not feel that way....\"   \n\n\nPerhaps OP could invite them over and ask what the problem is.  \n\n\nAt any rate, I'm getting the vibe she's getting a little overwhelmed by the planning and she can absolutely step out and still be Emma's friend.", "Emma hasnt done anything? Who do you think had incited Chris? How could be possibly think things arent going as Emma wanted? Emma has told him.", "Where do you think Chris, who doesnt seem to be envolved in the bridesmaid dresses or the party, get all this things to complain about? Of course, from Emma! If was or not intentionnaly from her part, it did damage to OP. Both bride and groom are wrong.", "Send screenshots to both of them in a group text. It\u2019s not childish or immature. You can do it from a place of - I\u2019m honestly confused and the language used towards me was abusive. I think it best I stay away from the wedding while you two figure this out. I wouldn\u2019t go to this wedding at all something is weird here.", "> Chris was so so strong with his words and still has not replied to my request to discuss this\n\nFor me, I am willing to forgive, often, one-time mistakes.  But if someone makes a mistake, I may respond something like this: \"I think this is a mistake, are you sure about what you're saying?  Can we speak in person?  I don't want the last thing said to be this unduly harsh comment from you.\"  That's me giving them a chance to change, to make the \"one-time mistake\" *really* be a one-time mistake.  If they don't respond, that's as good as doubling down.  If they're not taking it back, that means they stand by it.  I asked directly and expect an answer, so silence is not a get-out-of-jail-free card, for this.\n\nIf they don't take it back, then it's not a one-time mistake.  The person is committing to the mistake, and making that mistake more than once.  At that point, I feel pretty clear that I did not misinterpret, and did not \"unfairly\" make decisions -- I came back to them, gave them a chance to clarify, etc.  So it's done, at that point.  The last time I confronted someone like this, it was my girlfriend, who at the time owed me $5000, and decided \"she had paid enough\" of it (she had paid down about $1500 of the original $6500, so she still owed $5k).  I asked her to explain, I asked her if she was sure, I asked her if she understood she was not only \"welching\" in friendship terms, but it was a big enough amount that it'd also be something worth going after legally in small claims court.  Did she understand all that, I asked?  She did.  Oh.  And she asked if *I* understood that if I took her to court over it, she would utterly *destroy* me to all our friends.  She would tell them all I was a huge asshole and screwing her over and any awful thing she could think up.  OK.  Got it.  So I said, fine, I'm not pursuing the $5000.  She said great, I'll come by in an hour and you can take me to dinner.  I said, \"No, sorry, I don't want to be around you anymore.  We're over.\"  She began sobbing, dropped the phone, drove to my house screaming in tears, pounded on the door, screamed more, sobbed more.  I opened the door to give her back her key, and she gave me my key.  Then I didn't ask her in, and closed the door.  I haven't spoken to her since.  It has been maybe 8 years.\n\nWhen someone is confronted about their hurtful behavior and they don't correct it, that's no mistake.  What you do with that is up to you, but let's not pretend that Chris is your friend, here.  His actions and lack of regret is telling you loud and clear what he values, and it isn't you.", "We don't know who it is coming from, but it could also be Chris. Maybe he is controlling. Emma isn't allowed friends that he doesn't know, doesn't have family at the wedding etc\n\nThe \"stay in your f-ing lane\" is a big worry. Who says that to your wife's only bridesmaid? That is the time and reason to exit.", "Exacly!!! She has been complaning to him about OP. I would have a serious talk to them. Also, I would return all the dresses and would not pich anything to this people wedding. The bride and the groom can choose the bridesmaid dress and the bridal party and the money. OP have no obligation to help people who dont appreciate her.", "I don't think you can necessarily blame his drunk reaction on Emma. He is still responsible for calling in a rage and if he's enough of an AH to do that then he's enough of an AH to misconstrue an innocuous comment from his fiance. We don't know what she said.", "It is entirely possible that Emma doesn't have any other close female friends because Chris drove them away.  Maybe she's said a few throw away things because she's stressed, or maybe he didn't fully pay attention to what she was saying, or maybe she's fine with all of this but Chris doesn't like it.  The only actual bad behavior here is coming from Chris so I think it's crappy everyone is assuming that Emma must somehow be to blame. Chris is responsible for Chris's actions and it is Chris's actions that suck.", "Just like how your been to nice, not already leaving this crazy situation she might of told you plans and changed her mind then been to nice to tell you but then complained to your friend.", "Chris is the one to blame?! Yeah sure. But we cant paint him as a villain and take Emma from the equation. If she was so innocent she would clear the air with Chris and explain everything. We cant put all blame on Chris when, from OP, he didnt ever had this kind of behavior. \nBoth bride and groom are to blame for miss communication, for being ungratfull, whatever. They are both wrong and own OP an appology", "It's called being tolerant. Not every instance of annoyance needs to be a fight. People who can't put up with a slight annoyance sometimes aren't being honest, they are being annoying themselves.", "Why does it matter that OP ordered them all when she specifically said in the post that she planned to keep one and return the rest? It's also her own money, not the bride's, so the bride doesn't get to be upset about the cost either.", "I wouldn't want anyone to have that kind of dent on their credit card because of me.  I would be especially upset if I thought I somehow created an expectation that they should do that.  I would feel really bad if someone misunderstood me like that.  Buying and returning a bunch of dresses is also a huge hassle I wouldn't wish on anyone.", "Emma is a people pleaser who backstabs everyone.  No wonder she has no friends.", "Yep run away !! They are ungrateful and Emma rather than talk to runs instead to Chris playing the victim !!! Run !!!", "NTA. If they say you are doing it wrong by all means step aside and give them room to find someone who will do it right.

The bride can plan her own party and invite whomever she wants. She isn\u2019t busy planning a full wedding right? They are eloping. My understanding of eloping was that you were forgoing  attendants in fancy attire, a wedding ceremony with guests, etc. If they are just signing paperwork with just a few people invited why do you have to get a specific dress to fit a theme or help cover costs. What costs? \n\nWish them well and return all the dresses. Go back to your life.", "If you want to safe your friendship with Chris, you better back out as a bridesmaid, 'cause there's obvious some (premeditated?) communication problem and you're the victim right in the middle.\n\nAnd don't appologize for anything if it isn't your fault, 'cause that makes it seem that it actually WAS your fault... Call or text Chris and TAKE your appologies back. \n\nYou carried out the bride's wishes, and get lashed out for it by the groom.\n\nNTA", "NTA but you really need to have a conversation with both Chris and Emma about what they expect of you and that they need to both be on the same page with whatever is planned.", "NTA - the language he used towards you is gross.

Clearly you were putting a lot of time, energy and money into something that was not appreciated. I think you should cancel the party and let her know she should plan it herself. Offer to still be her bridesmaid if she wants you to be but choose a dress and just stay with that. And you certainly have no obligation to help them with the wedding. IOW do whatever you feel is best for you clearly you trying to appease Emma has not been appreciated. NTA.", "Yikes\u2026if it was one thing, it could have been a misunderstanding. However there are multiple concerns that Chris brought up, so it does sound like Emma probably did complain to him.\n\nIt sounds like you were going above and beyond (7 dresses to return 6? What a hassle!) but they don\u2019t see it that way. Yes, THEY, as in both of them. And why the heck should you help pay for their wedding after all that? \n\nPull out, save your money, and go on a girls night out with the other two friends.\n\nNTA", "This. You\u2019re doing them a favour by being in their wedding party. Why would you tolerate any abuse?", "Send the screen shots. It's going to burn to the ground anyways so leave your name and conscience clear", "Best corse of action would be to talk to both parties face to face. Hopefully that is possible. Clear the air and then decide.  Maybe it was communication break down between the two of them, maybe he is controlling her. \n\nBut don\u2019t jump to conclusions, and don\u2019t get in the middle of the he said, she said.", "This response is what I would text to both of them (in a group message) - especially emphasizing that you were only complying with HER ideas / wishes.  I\u2019d wish them well & pull out of wedding. \n\nNTA.", "Perhaps she is jealous of your friendship with Chris. So she's set you up by telling you to invite who you want to the hen, specially so she can complain. She probably gave you multiple choices on the dress hoping you'd pick one she could complain about on the day and say you got one that she didn't like. But you went above and beyond and bought all of them so she could pick the dress she liked the best on you. So she's used that to complain about. It definitely feels like she's trying to sabotage your friendship with Chris. If I was you I'd call Chris and explain that you were just doing what she told you to do with the invites, and you wanted her to be able to pick her favourite dress for you to wear on the day out of the ones she suggested.

She's doing the two-face move - telling you one thing with smiles, and him another with croc tears.\n\n**This is all coming from Emma.** You don't know what she's actally been telling him, but his reaction hints that it's not great.\n\nOrdering extra dresses when not asked to do so wasn't a bright move, and complaining about escalating costs makes no sense when you're the one adding extra stuff. But in general NTA.\n\nYour problem is Emma. Figure that out, first", "Is it possible she has simply moaned about a couple of things mildly and Chris has blown it out of proportion?\n\nI could understand her maybe complaining e.g. \"I picked out 5 dresses I liked, why has she added 2 of her own? What was wrong with the ones I picked?\" And he's half listened and not understood it was just 2 dresses? Similar with the hen do, out of embarrassment she had to ask you to invite other people.\n\nI'm not justifying it, but I'm noticing a severe lack of anyone suggesting you maybe speak to Emma to try to understand what's happened, rather than the nuclear \"I'm done!\" approach.", "I just don't see why you think it would happen because of a misunderstanding and not just what the person felt like doing because they found it easier.  It sounds like the dresses are all from the same online store so returning 6 isn't more hassle than returning 1, but even if multiple stores *were* involved, when I'm trying to decide between multiple options I prefer to have them  all at once to compare."]}
