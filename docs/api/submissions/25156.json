That just stood out to me, along with theories of Emma possibly complaining to Chris, explaining his drunken angry texts. Chris isn't a very good friend to blow up at you like that without hearing your side, regardless of how many years you've known him. I'd be wary of Emma too. I've cut out a few friends even knowing them for almost ten years because they turned out to be manipulators. Time spent on a friendship doesn't always equate to a trustworthy friendship. \n\nOf course, I don't know your friends or yourself personally so I'm just adding to the pile of theories.

Therefore regardless of the friendship, Emma wants to make very sure you are not close friends after the marriage so you are not a potential threat. Nothing does that like setting you up so she can make herself seem reasonable. Chris sounds like a putz if he fell for it without telling you but do not get caught up in her game. \n\nEither (1) meet in person with both of them to explain what happened and show Chris Emma\u2019s links to the dresses and correspondence on hen party invites sp they have a chance to apologise or (2) skip out politely on the wedding and cut ties with both of them.\n\nEither way NTA", "It could be from the stress of planning the wedding.  Emma is overwhelmed and is looking for an outlet.  \n\nChris also might\u2019ve been ignoring her complaints until your name came up.  That caught his attention and Emma leaned in and started to exaggerate because was listening.  \n\nI have an ex-bestie like this.  Honestly, she was the nicest person to your face but would talk behind people backs constantly due to her own social anxiety. I didn\u2019t see it coming until she turned her disdain on my bf after a disagreement. She turned on me when I wouldn\u2019t take her side against him.", "I had a friend like this. Her 'being nice' caused a lot more grief and drama (as it was causing fights and then we found out she was telling everyone different things) than if she was just honest."]}
