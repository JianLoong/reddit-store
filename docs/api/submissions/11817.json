Beth and I never got along. I was into Dungeons and Dragons, videogames, and other nerdy stuff. Beth's idea of a good time was going clothing shopping, or to a trendy restaurant. Beth did have a daughter who I really did enjoy, Sam (Not real name) who was 4 years younger then I was. Sam and I hit it off, she loved having a big sister! I would take her to the movies, we would play games together, etc. I tried to be a good older sister.\n\nThe problem was my birthday is on May 7th, Sam's is May 6th. Every year we had a co-party. In reality it was Sam's birthday. Every year it would be all about Sam's wants. If Sam was super into ponies the party would be equestrian themed. But what really made me mad was the cake. You see I really don't like chocolate. My family knew this, but every year the cake would be chocolate, because it's what Sam liked. When I didn't have a slice Beth would get mad at me for not having any of the expensive cake she got for us. I would remind everyone that I don't like chocolate. Every year I would plead with my Dad to let me have my own birthday, or at least my own cake, or do cupcakes with all kinds of different flavors. I just wanted something to be mine on my own birthday! But it never changed.\n\nSo here's where I may have been the asshole. On the week of my 17th Birthday I took Sam out on a sister's only birthday. We went to a movie and had dinner. At the end of the sisters only birthday I told Sam I would not be coming to the co-party and I hope she had a good time. Sam said she was fine with it, I found out later this was a lie and Sam was in fact upset that I didn't want to come. On the day of the co-party I snuck out and drove to my friends house where we had a birthday Party. I had the first fun birthday I had in years! It was just about me having a good time with my people. My friends Mom even got me a key lime pie, my favorite dessert in the world! It was wonderful!\n\nI got home about 10:30 PM and I found my computer, Play Station, and all my other stuff gone! Beth was so mad I snuck out and didn't come to my birthday she locked all my stuff away. I was then grounded for a month. After Beth finished yelling at me I asked Beth what flavor was the cake? Wouldn't you know it chocolate. I informed Beth that this was never really my birthday and this co-party was just an excuse to never let me have one, and she was delusional if she thought otherwise. I jumped back into my car and drove over to my friends house. I didn't come home for weeks and it wasn't until the police nabbed me for being a runaway that I returned home.\n\nSo there you have it Reddit AITA?  \n\n\nEDIT:  \nBoth my sister and I are adults now, but we are currently in a fight over this memory. She told me how much me doing this hurt her feelings. I was upset she didn't understand why this all hurt my feelings. So to settle this I posted it here.

Ding ding ding, we have an AH!\nYou, OP, are NTA.", "nta -  but Beth was a monster to you", "NTA\n\nOffer to host a co-party for Sam this year to make it up to her.  Make sure everything is what you like.  When she's upset, tell her \"Now you know what I went through **EVERY** year.\"", "NTA. I bet Beth wonders why you are NC with her and your enabling dad", "I share a bday with step sister,  the hurt feelings were always over the damn cake! It wasn't until I was complaining to a friend who reminded me that he shared a bday with jesus. He also was miffed about his lack of bday cake.", "NTA Sam can suck it. She is upset you didn't bond with her by doing everything she wanted? Tell her to get over herself and then go order a key lime pie somewhere, take a picture and send it to her saying \"Mmmm NOT CHOCOLATE. Something to celebrate!\" Maybe she'll get the idea.", "Sounds like your sister was the golden child. She was old enough to see that the parties were all about HER and conveniently never said anything about the cake. Your parents should have either had two cakes or 2 parties. Too bad your sister doesn't want to understand that it was all about her.", "NTA. As for your current disagreement with your sister, I honestly don\u2019t see your positions as necessarily incompatible. I can understand why 13 year old Sam was very hurt that her adored big sister wasn\u2019t coming to her (Sam\u2019s) party. And I can understand why you were so upset to be treated poorly over all those birthdays. I hope that you two can talk it over like adults who love each other and get to a point where you each understand the other\u2019s point of view.", "This. OP, I bet your stepmom would hate if you threw her and your mom a party together that was all about your mom, or your aunt, etc. What she did to you was mean, but these people still being \"mad\" at you is crazy.", "Yeah, I think Sam's entitlement really *takes the* ***cake***! I'll, uh, see myself out.", "Yeah, as a twin, we always had two cakes. And then 3 cakes when my baby bro was born the day after our birthday. It's not that difficult to accommodate the different preferences of the birthday girls.", "Or heck, you can get cakes that are half chocolate, half vanilla.", "IKR? Or even just get birthday cupcakes in various flavors. What garbage parents.", "Oh I don't talk to my dad. F that guy. The only one I'm still in contact with is my step sister.", "I'm also curious to see what she had to say.  As an adult she absolutely should be able to look back and realize how unfair and really cruel this \"co-party\" situation was.", "It's because her memory is not your memories.  She obviously enjoyed the shared birthdays and thought you did to.", "This is so sad. What a selfish bastard he must have been.", "Your sister is an AH. She was old enough at that point to understand what was happening for you and she\u2019s definitely old enough now. She could have advocated for a dessert you would both like. Or at the least understand that you wanted to enjoy your own birthday. She sounds very spoiled.", "Good for you.", "Yeah, I can see a 13 not being able to put herself into someone else's place so I understand Sam being hurt back then but OP says they are both adults now.\n\nSam needs to grow up.\n\nAnd Step-mom and Dad are total AHs.", "True. But the problem is, OP is telling her that she didn\u2019t enjoy them, and Sam is still digging in and prioritizing her own feelings. That is selfish now.", "A 13 year old is old enough to understand the cake is never what her sister likes and at a minimum they should have their own cakes.\n\nSpeaking of which how did they handle the candles? I assume the younger sister got to blow them out because she was younger and needed it more.", "If your sister was 13 and saying how hurt she was she would be a brat. \n\nAs a adult? She is hurt because you didn't want to participate in the farce that your birthday was being celebrated or that you didn't go to her birthday and she simply didn't care that you never had one?", "I literally said they're both entitled to their feelings lol", "And I\u2019m disagreeing lol. Sam isn\u2019t entitled to her feelings anymore. As a child she was because she couldn\u2019t understand the situation, but now as an adult she\u2019s not entitled to feeling hurt that her sister didn\u2019t choose to play the background character at OPs own bday", "As an adult she needs to get over it. Doesn't mean she isn't allowed to be hurt no matter how old she is.", "\"I was hurt by it when I was 13 but Im over it now\" is a very different statement than \"I was hurt by it when I was 13 and I still am\".\n\nWhat you're suggesting \"I was hurt by it when I was 13 but I'm over it now but I'm still hurt by it\" doesn't even make sense"]}
