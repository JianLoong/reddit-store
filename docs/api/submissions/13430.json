This BS your parents are sprouting is just as bad as the \"boys will be boys\" argument. It's making excuses for bad behaviour. Really bad behaviour.\n\nYes your son misbehaved too, vut in the end, gis shenanigans will only hurt himself and it's most likely it'll stop if his grades drop. He can learn from his direct consequences.\n\nBut your daughter's actions hurt others and if you don't force her to feel consequences, there will be none and you'll enable her to keep harrassing others and become a mean bully. The moment this could come back to haunt her will be to late for her to learn from it. This behaviour will then be deeply ingrained into her personality.\n\nIt seems though as if she picked this up from your siblings and parents. That's why she immediately ran to them for aid.

It is unequivocally imperative that a parent judiciously punishes their children when they display inappropriate behavior, and one's sex hormones, which can have effects on behavior, cannot be an excuse for such behavior. In this case, the daughter's reprehensible behavior warrants a punishment commensurate with the severity of her transgressions, and it is commendable that the parents are taking steps to address the situation and find anti-bullying resources. Moreover, the fact that the stepson's misconduct differs substantially in nature from that of the daughter obviates any comparison between the two, and thus any argument that one was treated more leniently than the other is fallacious. It is essential to uphold a consistent standard of discipline while being cognizant of the individual circumstances of each case.", "NTA:\n1) your step-son is acting in a very usual way, and doing so in a manner that in truth, is only harming himself.
