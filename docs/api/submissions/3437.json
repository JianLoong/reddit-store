Both her mental and physical health have been declining quite a bit in the last year and earlier this year she had to be put in a nursing home.  Most of this year she's still been doing well enough to come to family gatherings and holidays, but she wasn't well enough to come to Thanksgiving.  \n\nMy dad had warned me that she wasn't doing well and wouldn't be at Thanksgiving.  She probably doesn't have much time left and he suggested I visit her on black Friday because it might be the last chance I have to see her.  I live a few hours away so I usually only see family every month or two.  \n\nMy wife and I planned to go visit and I asked my parents if they'd watch our kids (6 and 8) while we went and visited her.  That's when the trouble started.  My dad seemed confused at first and didn't understand why I wasn't taking them with me.  I have personal reasons for not wanting to take them.  When I was a kid I was lucky enough that some of my great grandparents lived long enough that I remember them well.  But I also watched my great-grandma die of Alzheimer's.  I remember visiting her in the nursing home and the memories I have of her near the end of her life aren't especially pleasant.  I don't really want my kids' last memories of their great-grandma to be her confused and afraid and not knowing who any of us are.  My dad was pretty upset about it.  He thought I was being cruel to both my kids and my grandma by not giving them what might be a last chance to see each other.\n\nAt the end of the day my mom agreed to watch the kids and my wife and I visited my grandma alone.  She was semi-lucid while we were there.  She had periods where she seemed to know what was going on and others where she didn't know who I was or was clearly hallucinating.  I honestly don't know if I made the right choice or not.  My dad was pretty upset about it the rest of the weekend.  He made several comments and before we left for home he told me he hopes I don't regret keeping them from seeing her one last time if she dies before Christmas.\n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1669645296, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6xtlk/aita_for_not_taking_my_kids_to_visit_my_dying/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You wanted to make sure your kids had a happy last memory of their great-grandma. Everyone can have their opinion about it, but the kids are young and as parents, your wife and you can make the decision the way you think is better for them.", "NTA. My grandfather (who raised me; meant the world to me; and was the the most important person in my life ever) died from Alzheimer\u2019s. The first time I saw him in the nursing home was a shock. He had from a strong, muscular, active, vibrant man to nothing but skin and bones. It was horrifying. I still have nightmares about it 20 years later. Your young kids don\u2019t need to see that.", "I get that he\u2019s mourning, but NTA. I was forced to see my grandmother when she was dying and completely out of it and now that\u2019s my last memory of her.", "NAH, I fully understand both sides.\n\nThis happened to my grandmother, and I didn\u2019t get to see her in her final moments because my parents didn\u2019t want me to remember her like that. Tbh I kind of wished I could have sometimes, but I don\u2019t resent my parents for the choice because I see where they were coming from.", "Nah imo, I'm guessing this is your paternal grandmother, so dad's mom, he's gonna be sensitive about it no matter how you spin it, things he does or want to do may or may not make sense, in the end he just want her to be surrounded by family.\n\n On your end it also makes sense, you remember how much something like that messed with you years/decades later", "Nta. I dont think anyone is the ah here. You all care about your family member and are trying to look out for them.", "NTA. Your kids are young and seeing a loved one in a declining state can be traumatic, especially dealing with Alzheimer's and loss of mental health.\n\nLet their memories remain of their loving great-grandma. Your dad is obviously grieving for his mom, but is out of line here.", "NTA - you have every right as a parent to decide what is best for your children and how you want them to remember their grandparent. Visiting her with your wife allowed you time to focus on your grandma's needs. Sorry your parents are being AH about it.", "NTA. Let their last memories of her be happier ones.", "NAH\n\nI don't know what the right answer is here.  I can understand why your father was upset.  \n\nINFO:  my main question tho is, were your kids especially close to their great grandma?   Had they met her?  I believe I met 1 of mine, but I have no memory of it.    \n\nIt certainly can be a scary traumatic thing for a little kid.   I suppose that perhaps your 8 year old could have gone, and you could have had a discussion along the way prepping them for what to expect, answering questions.  That is, IF, they were close to Great GRandma, and if they wanted to go.  I wouldn't have forced it.    Not so much with your 6 year old.   \n\nReviewing my memories of nursing homes I was brought to as a young person, the experience was frankly less about the actual relative I was visiting, vs the rest of the place.  Open mouthed, slack jawed, vacant staring ancient husks of what were once people just lined up in wheel chairs facing random directions.  Warehouses for the old.  Learning about death is one thing,  seeing the indignities that can come with it,  is another thing entirely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is my understanding that nursing homes have gone thru quite a number of changes in the many years since.   Regardless,  My parents have expressed in no uncertain terms that there will be no nursing homes in their future.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nI'm not sure why people shelter their children from learning about the process of aging.  Alzheimer's runs amuck in my family's DNA.  It's not easy, but having had exposure to it all of my life, allows me to have more compassion with my family members now going through it.\n\nAllow them at least the opportunity to see their great-grandma... maybe in the morning before she sundowns.\n\nI don't mind being down-voted on this.", "NAH\n\nThe situation is very delicate.\n\nI understand your dad's position on last chances (my grandpa died in July and I was happy to see him one last time before he was hospitalized and died, it gave me a sense of closure, but I'm an adult, not a kid).\n\nI also understand your point of view about wanting to protect your children from something that can be scary or sad for them, if their grandmother is confused and doesn't recognize them.\n\nIf grandma is still lucid or semi-lucid, perhaps you can hint the situation to your children in age-appropriate words, explaining that grandma is very ill and the doctors can't help her, that she has forgotten many things because of the illness and she may act strange and no longer be the grandmother they remember. Do they feel like seeing her?\n\nIf they don't feel like it, that's okay.\n\nSee what input the kids give you.\n\nOr, is a video call possible?", "NTA. This is your choice to make. His vision of how it could have been is just that - he doesn't know how it would have been for any of you.", "NTA. I was severely traumatized by being taken to see my dying great-grandmother at a similar age. I suffered nightmares about it for months. My grades tanked. I stopped eating. I honestly don't think six year olds are mature enough to understand death at a level they can handle.", "NTA and I say this as the child who lived with grandma and grandpa and helped take care of them in their final years.    \n\n\nI would give anything to be able to remember them without memories of hospital beds, doctor's visits, and everything I saw from seven years old on until my grandmother's death almost thirty years later.  It's not fair to spoil your children's good memories of great grandma by adding in what could be very frightening memories of delirious grandma lying in a hospital bed.", "Uuuum hell no NTA. He put you in a shitty situation by seeing your great grandma in the state you did just so he could quell some distorted sense of obligation. That was solely for HIS benefit. \n\nThat did nothing positive for you or your great grandmother. I am so sorry he put you both through that. You put your children's and grandmother's needs first and that is what a great parent does. Good job OP, I'm truly sorry that she is not doing well.", "NTA!!! I was the kid who watched my grandma slowly rot away in a nursing home from Alzheimer\u2019s. My children will N E V E R be put in a similar situation and anyone who has a problem with it can kick rocks. Those parts of my childhood were awful. My brother is legit terrified of anything medical because of the whole situation. It was rotten. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re protecting your kids :)\n\nEdited to add: of course your dad feels this way though, because he thinks you turned out just fine after watching your grandparent die. You wanting to do differently by your children, to him, might feel like an attack on his parenting choices. A lot of parents can\u2019t handle it when their adult children do parenting differently.", "NAH, this is a tough situation.\n\nIf they have met her and she still appears wellish then maybe go back and see her with them. Or even ask your children what they want to do.", "NTA-   \n\n\nMy Great Grandmother passed away when I was in my early teens. I saw her once in about 5 years because when I was younger, dementia had kicked in and I didn't understand why she didn't recognize me, got angry with me because I wasn't who she thought I was and frankly it scared me. That was the last memory I had of her and did not see her when she was dying because of it. My early childhood had been full of wonderful memories of her but instantly when I think of her now, that's the only memory that pops up.   \n\n\nI understand why you wouldn't want your kids to remember her like that.", "Nah. Not every memory children have is pleasant and that is not always a bad thing.", "NTA - you're protecting your kids from the possibility that she may not even recognize who they are, which can be scary and confusing for kids. I feel you did the right thing as a parent myself and someone who watched one of their grandparents die from alzheimer's at a young age as well. I wish someone had protected me from that pain.", "NAH, as someone who had the same sort of call to make this past summer. I thankfully got to visit just a week before she really declined, and brought my 8 year old and my then  6 month old. They got to make one last positive memory and nothing can replace that. I also have a 2 year and 5 year old who would have been too high energy, and it would not have been a good time with them also there. \n\nYou know your kids, and you know best how they can handle things. I also understand the side of wanting the kids to have one last memory, and if done sooner it would likely have been a great thing for everyone involved. With the timing you had though, I agree it's likely better that the kids weren't there.", "NTA for wanting to protect your kids, but also kinda the AH for not letting your kids see their great grandma before she passes. While it may not be a pleasant memory, exposing kids to difficult situations such as illness or death can help them to grow and with guidance help them understand and appreciate life.", "I'll be odd and say slightly NAH. You are totally in the right to not take your kids to go see your grandma. So here I'm assuming this is your dad's mother, which if so then he is going through a lot of emotions right now. He may already be mourning, thinking about a funeral, and trying to make her last days alive pleasant for her which probably includes seeing her great grandchildren. Your dad isn't right for being so rude to you but for this particular issue I'd give him some grace.", "ESH. i understand the rationale but there\u2019s something very important in being able to say goodbye no matter the situation. my parents didn\u2019t take me nor my sister to say goodbye to my great aunt when she was in the hospital dying. that was over ten years ago and i\u2019m still a little hurt and angry about that. i don\u2019t think your kids will hold it against you but it\u2019s also better for closure when you get to say goodbye to someone knowing that it\u2019s the last time. i\u2019ve had multiple relatives die and oh how i wished i could\u2019ve been there to see them beforehand. personably, that\u2019s the toughest part about remembering someone who\u2019s gone", "YTA. Softly. \n\nIf your kids are old enough to be confused by it (instead of oblivious to it) they are also old enough to have it explained to them. While you're just trying to protect your kids, you are putting your fears and your experience on them. Maybe they are even old enough to be given a choice in the matter.\n\nAlso I believe that we should be way more involved with death especially in the US because we separate it from our lives to the detriment of millions of people's mental health. We are supposed to watch our elders die! It's how we are supposed to prepare for our own death.\n\nWe treat death worse than unnatural. We try to hide it and in the process create people that can't handle it. So I agree with your father, I don't think it actually makes you a AH but I do think you were wrong.", "NTA.\n\nReally tough choice that quite frankly I think you'd have questioned no matter what you had done. My mother has worked as a nurse for over 30yrs and whenever it was a family's last chance to see a dying family member who's in really rough shape, she'd say you can go in but always recommended against it. That's the last memory you take away of a loved one and death isn't pretty, especially if it's a progressive degenerative condition.\n\nThere was no objectively right or wrong move. You did what you thought was best (your partner too I assume) and acted accordingly. Your father needs to back off and not lord it over you every chance he gets.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think seeing her disorientated and hallucinating would have been good for them. You and your wife made a decision to shield them from having a sad last memory of their great grandma. It was a tough decision and your dad is in a tough spot right now, so I would cut him some slack but if he won\u2019t stop pushing it or trying to guilt you just reiterate that you are their parent and you will make the decisions regarding your children", "NTA.. I see his point, I do, but you as the parent make that call and you did. \n\nBut I was the 8 year old whose great grandma passed in a nursing home with dementia and it was truly awful. You cannot fully understand dementia at that age. You just can\u2019t. That\u2019s my memory of her. When she is brought up, that\u2019s where my head immediately goes. It\u2019s not the happier memories of her not in the nursing home.", "NTA. You, the parent, get to decide what and who your young children should experience. From your own personal experience, you have found that it was not good to meet a dying person with dementia, and so of course you do not want to subject your children to this.", "YTA Your Dad is right. Your kids are old enough to understand what's going on. You could have explained your grandma mental condition before hand.", "YTA - Your reasons are valid but this isn't really your decision. You are a parent who wants to protect your kids but I know for a fact if I was a kid who saw this post years after she died I would be livid. You should do the best you can to explain to the kids the situation AND LET THEM DECIDE what they want - particularly if they were clsoe prior to her illness.", "NAH, at least for now.\n\nYour reasoning is completely valid.  I was 24 years old when I saw my grandpa in his last week, and I wish I hadn't. He didn't know I was there, and decades later, it's still hard to think about without crying.\n\nIf your kids were older, you could maybe prepare them, and give them an option, but there's no reason to upset your kids at that age.\n\nAs for your dad's reaction, he's clearly going through a very difficult time right now.  However, I would hope that, after he's had time to process things, he'll understand and respect, if not agree with, your decision.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She would talk about people that had died back in the 60s (this was the early 90s) my dad was still a little boy and my brother and I were two thieves breaking into the house. Not a great experience for a small kid. When my maternal grandmother started forgetting things a few years ago she had a year she couldn\u2019t remember anything past. Luckily it was a short time before so she remembered my sons names who they were to her and she was always happy to see them.
