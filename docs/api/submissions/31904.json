{"id": 31904, "submission_id": "185rof4", "title": "AITA for telling my brother to go fuck himself and blocking his number?", "selftext": "My brother (37m) and I (41m) had a fairly normal relationship growing up, had a lot of things in common and enjoyed each other's company.  About a decade ago, he entered into a relationship with someone who I have a personality conflict with, and even though that has strained our relationship, we can still be civil and talk/hang out occasionally.  \n\nDuring this last decade, he's asked me for help on many occasions, whether that be watching his kids for hours, giving him round-trip rides 1+ hours away, spending days helping him on projects like fixing his vehicles, dog sitting, and more.  I've never asked for anything.\n\nThe last few years have been very rough for me, wife was cheating, divorce, lost my job, long-term pets passed away and the mental health and financial fallout from all of those things.  He wasn't there for me and didn't check in with me during this time. \n\nI need to perform some car repairs, and don't have a garage available at the moment. A few months ago, my parents sold him their house at a 100k discount, and it has a 2 car garage.  My girlfriend suggested I ask him to use his.  I asked him via text if I could use it for a day or two over the weekend, giving 2 weeks advance notice.  \n\nHe responded about 6 hours later saying, \"I don't think I'll have room in there with all the wood stuff\" (referring to some wood that him and his friend are using to build a small skateboard ramp).  It broke me to read this, knowing there was plenty of room, and would take less than 15 minutes to move some things to the other side of the garage temporarily.\n\nI thought about it for a few hours and decided to reply, calling him out on his reasoning, highlighting the years of me giving him my time and help whenever he needed it.  I ended the text saying that I'd rather work out in the cold than be around people who don't value and respect me. \n\nHe replied to that and said even if the wood is moved, there's lots of other stuff to move and clean, and that he is planning to do multiple projects in there(he now also has a full basement with a workshop). He also says he doesn't understand where my perspective is coming from.\n\nI take this as lying/gaslighting and simply responded that he knows exactly where I'm coming from, and these are excuses. He finally admits that he just doesn't feel comfortable with car repairs going on in his garage and I need to understand and respect that. (I helped repair multiple vehicles for him in this same garage throughout the years my parents lived there)\n\nThe one time I've asked him for help, which I think is a relatively small ask that doesn't require any time or expense from him, he lies and gaslights me. I temporarily lost my cool after his last reply and told him to go fuck himself and blocked him.  My sister thinks I'm overreacting and is trying to justify his behavior.

I lent him money that I never asked for back, I drove he and his family to places to go and visit paid for food for them. \n\nI was made redundant and I always get really depressed around the Christmas period due to personal reasons. I told him that because of all of this I wouldn't be doing Christmas for anyone other than his kids (everyone else in the family was fine with this) and he accused me of not caring and being a horrible brother.\n\nWe went NC shortly after that because I called him on his disgusting behaviour towards our mum when she was trying to arrange a date to come and give the kids the presents she got them and he was yelling down the phone swearing at her.\n\nSometimes you realize that people are users.

But when you\u2019ve lost so much, why lose your brother too?\nExplain how you feel and leave it at that. If he offers to help great, if not then so be it. Move on. Just a simple no next time they ask for help.\n\nYou know I\u2019m in a similar situation with my friend. Been helping them out countless times over the years, the guy wouldn\u2019t even give me a 10 minute car ride. \n\nThe lesson I\u2019ve learned is if you are going to help someone out, don\u2019t expect them to return the favour. No matter how small or big.\n\nBe more selfish, stop doing things for others and learn to say no. It sucks but that\u2019s reality.", "Just because you were fortcoming with \"favours\" doesnt entitle you to receive them back. Its not a transactional relationship. If he isnt willing to help you anytime youve asked, then you just cut him off re favours. If he cant do what you did for him in return, he must not think anything of it or simply not really care. \n\nYou can let it go and just have more casual relationship going forward.", "NTA - the support you have given him sounds one sided but should have been given freely rather than as a transactional exchange.", "NTA.\n\nI think its a slight overreaction however.\n\nSometimes in life theres just siblings who are more generous or giving than others. You've found out late that things are one sided like this with ur bro.\n\nUnblock him and give it a chance IMO.

Be proud of that and be bigger man.", "Gentle YTA. Sounds like you\u2019re really upset that your brother hasn\u2019t shown up for you in the ways you\u2019ve shown up for him and his \u201cNo\u201d in this instance is the proverbial straw. Being angry because he\u2019s not offering the support you\u2019ve shown him is totally valid; blowing up because you didn\u2019t get your way is not (even when the reason for saying no seems ridiculous in this instance).", "YTA.  You wanted to use his home.  His first response was \"I don't think I'll have room...\".  That means no.  You kept pushing it.  What you refer to as \"lying/gaslighting\" is basically him saying no again and again in different ways, because you wouldn't accept the first \"no\", and you kept arguing with him.\n\nIt's his home.  He can say no.  You seem unreasonable for telling him to go f himself and for blocking him, just because he said no to one request.  He is allowed to say no.  You reaction is so over the top.\n\nThis is why if someone asks me for something and I need to say no to them, I don't explain myself and I don't provide reasons, and I don't answer the question \"why?\",  because it just gives people an opportunity to argue about the reasons and try to invalidate them just because they think I should say yes to whatever they want.", "You\u2019re overreacting. \n\nYou asked him for a small favor, wqs denied, and now your world is ending, and he is the biggest AH ever?   Nah.", "NAH- I think you guys just need to cool off and talk things out.

But he asked you for help and now he's not willing to help back, not even way less than how much you helped him. Your sister probably just went into the usual \"no matter who's right, just end the conflict\" mode relatives go into quite often. \n\nWell, I think that now you know the answer the next time he asks you for help, as you know he most certainly will at some point. This kind of people are extremely predictable and you can be fairly certain that at some point he'll act like nothing happened and casually ask you for help.", "YTA\n\nget yourself tested for borderline personality disorder. you don't sound like you have a firm grasp of reality.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
