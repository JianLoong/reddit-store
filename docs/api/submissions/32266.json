They were driving there so they could leave whenever they wanted. They never showed up, because my father in law was apparently scared of getting sick on the trip, but then we found out they went on a boating trip with their friends that week instead.

Two weeks before the trip, we find out that my father in law never booked anything and was instead going on a golf trip with friends. As this was the week of the 4th of July, almost everything on the island was booked. His mother then finds a hotel and books it, without mentioning to us that it\u2019s only one room for 6 people. We go on the trip and it is absolutely miserable when we find out that 6 people are sleeping in a two bed room, with one bathroom.\n\nEver since then I told my husband that his family could meet us somewhere but I\u2019m never planning a trip or going on vacation with them again. His family has a habit of doing everything last minute, which leaves less options, makes things more expensive and has historically resulted in us being disappointed. Now my husband is upset with me because I won\u2019t plan trips with them but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong.

They can be included in any vacation you decide on but it is their responsibility to book THEIR accommodations and travel.  In light of your FIL's habit of only caring about HIS trips, it's not an unreasonable ask that they can be included, all they have to do is ..... want it enough to do something.  If your husband is mad, its at his parents inability to be responsible but he still cares for them and does not want to see a blanket kibosh on any future get togethers.  If every one is responsible for their own (after group decision on what/when/how long of a trip) , then your husband can be on his parents case about following up.", "NTA\nPlan your own fun vacations and do not invite them. When they seem to invite you to something let them know you are working and cannot get anymore time off.  I have in-laws who did a similar thing and I wish I\u2019d learned early on to just politely ignore the planning and avoid the inevitable disappointment.", "NTA. I would never spend my hard earned money on these \u201cvacations\u201d again. I hope your husband sees these posts.", "The solution to this travel problem with your in-laws is quite simple. All you have to do is tell them you are planning a trip to such and such place at such and such day and times we would like for you to join us if you can. Then you make your own arrangements for travel and accommodations. And they will have the option and opportunity of taking care of their own arrangements. If they do not, that is on them and it will not ruin your plans. And if your husband gets upset, he will have to talk to his side of the family about it not you. Definitely NTA.", "NTA Are you arguing over a planned trip or a hypothetical trip? If it\u2019s a hypothetical trip, this whole argument is moot. If it\u2019s a planned trip, then getting your own accommodations after they show you their confirmation would be the only way I\u2019d consider a trip with them.", "NTA. You\u2019re really not saying you won\u2019t go on vacation with them. You just won\u2019t leave the planning up to them. Plan any trip you want and then send them the details.  Say hubby and I are going to Hilton head from A ro B, here\u2019s the name of the resort and phone number so you can call and book a room if you would like to join us. If they invite you to join them on a trip, tell your husband that you will be willing to go as long as you have your own room, and then let him book it. That way you\u2019re not the one jumping through hoops, and he sees just how much the cost will be.", "NTA but making that blanket statement was harsh. \n\n\nWhy don\u2019t you stay pleasantly detached from it all and let your husband handle any and everything that has to do with his family and trips?\n\nAllow him to feel the disappointed next time they pull this nonsense without your input. \n\nIf you don\u2019t chime in maybe he\u2019ll solve it better. \n\nI think expressing your frustration and disappointment is putting him on the defensive. \n\n\nIt hurts him to see his family behave this way but it is his family and he doesn\u2019t want to admit that they are a disaster.", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they want to go in on something ( like a condo) the new rules is payment upfront, no refunds, no returns if you don't come.  IF they want to do something last min, then your husband is more then welcome to come, you have every right to stay home.", "NTA.  I agree with you, if someone continuously makes vacations unpleasant, then don\u2019t go with them anymore.  Give them the dates you are going and let them do their own planning.  They ditched you and then crammed all together because of their poor planning.  No go.", "NTA at all and I would volunteer to be your adoptive father in law , both locations you mentioned are huge golf destinations\n\n\nI will cook 4 awesome dinners and you won\u2019t see me besides those times,  I\u2019ll be out golfing\n\n\nMay offer to take family group photos", "NTA, and if your husband is upset at you while he let his family's lies slide not once, but twice, that's one hell of a red flag for your relationship.

And as long as you keep your expectations of them low, their failure to prioritize time with you won't destroy your good time.\n\nTL:DR, always plan and book for your own enjoyment in a way that doesn't hinge on unreliable others.", "Nta", "NTA  \nThere is absolutely no reason that your vacations should be dependent on his parents in any way. Make your plans. They can choose to join you or they can find a better option. Not your problem.  \nThey had 2 chances and screwed you over twice.
