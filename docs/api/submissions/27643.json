People also whined and somehow felt very entitled to decide how we got married. We gave no fucks. Suggest you do the same. NTA.\n\nAfter seeing your other comments, I have to ask: is the problem that your wife\u2019s mother calls her up and whines that Grandma is being a battleaxe to her?  That\u2019s a Mom problem. Mom needs to set her own boundaries with Grandma and/or hang up on Grandma (or walk out or whatever). It is not your wife\u2019s problem to solve Mom\u2019s relationship with Grandma. Now, it would be best if your wife did not antagonize and provoke grandma, but Grandma sounds like the type that if she wasn\u2019t blaming her daughter for your wife\u2019s behavior, she would be finding anything else to blame her daughter about. So your wife should not adjust her behavior to please Grandma, because it is unlikely to produce the results hoped for.\n\nI understand this from Mom\u2018s perspective \u2013 I have a 25-year-old daughter who fights like cats and dogs with my father. I am easily mowed down by him because I\u2019ve had a lifetime of being emotionally pounded by him. He\u2019s a lot better now, but there\u2019s still times that he\u2019s incredibly insensitive at best. \n\nMy way of dealing with my father is to smile and nod, and just accept that he is never going to be my ride or die. My daughter\u2019s way of dealing with my father\u2019s obnoxious behavior is to tell him where to stick it. I actually totally admire her for this. My father will huff and puff and wring his hands and say \u201cwell, I never!\u201d I used to get all perturbed about this and have all kinds of anxiety and think that I needed to make sure that my dad and my daughter were getting along. At some point, my daughter told me that she loves me very much but she\u2019s not going to sit there and take my dad\u2019s shit just so that he doesn\u2019t act like an asshole to me. I realized on a logical level that she was absolutely right, even if it did make my life inconvenient. I was still nervous about it, but I had to accept it! \n\nAnd it ended up being the best thing that ever happened. So now I just smile and nod and breathe and meditate whenever my dad complains about her, just like how I deal with everything else my father complains about. \n\nIf Mom is not bothering your wife to make nice so that she doesn\u2019t have to listen to Grandma whining, then don\u2019t worry about it. If Mom *is* begging your wife to make nice, gently tell Mom that Grandma being a cow is not Wife\u2019s problem. Or Mom\u2019s for that matter.

I didn\u2019t find out until months later that some of them were hurt by our decision to get married with them not physically present. I had to go through a lot of feelings of guilt because of their behaviour that didn\u2019t come out until later, but I\u2019m now realizing how selfish their behaviour is. My wedding day should not be tainted by the selfish behaviours of others and neither should yours. My wife and I did a small, simple but elegant wedding because that\u2019s what we wanted regardless of the pandemic.

Also congratulations", "For someone that did exactly the same, I love my family, but I love my husband and my mental health more.

To be quite honest, you don\u2019t owe them shit. You were kind enough to let them know you were getting married, and even planned to celebrate with family later. You two eloping and sharing that special moment with just the two of you is exactly that - special! I think it\u2019s romantic and I\u2019m happy you stuck with your original plan.\n\nMy hubby and I also let our families know we were eloping, and sure enough after we got married we got hit with so many \u201cyou should have let us be there too\u201d. Sorry not sorry! That day was just for the two of us, not our families. The additional celebration later on is for the family! They eventually got over it.

The family does not get to dictate what kind of wedding you desire. I don't think they will be angry forever. When babies come around they will forget all about it.", "NTA. The whole point of eloping is doing it secretly and without the family.", "NTA Your family is awfully strange. If this is the hill they die on, you have to wonder if they have ever had your best interests at heart.", "That\u2019s so weird they\u2019re making YOUR marriage about them and what they want. It\u2019s not their marriage, not their wedding. Stick to it, if they want to cut you off they shouldn\u2019t try and contact you if or when you guys decide to have children one day. They lost out because of their immaturity and selfishness", "No, NTA. It's your wedding. Tell them you'll do the wedding thing over if they pay for it. They seem more than a tad overbearing. But at the same time, weddings are really important to some families. I know I would be hurt if I wasn't at my daughter's wedding.", "NTA, its an elopement!", "NTA, absolutely.\n\nYour wedding is your (you and wife) business and your business only. PERIODT. They aren't owed squat.", "NTA. Does your family not know the meaning of elopement?", "NTA. You told them about the fact you wanted to elope, but evidently they don\u2019t know what that means.

The drama many of you have created, drama that has been brought on by your sense of entitlement to life decisions for us is exactly why we eloped. \n\nWe will be having a celebration of said life decisions on this date in the future.  \n\nIf you are able to move past your drama inducing sense of entitlement and are able to be a happy for us and help us celebrate our new life together feel free to join us. \n\nIf you feel we still 'owe' you something please do not show up and ruin our gathering.

The point of a wedding is to join two lives. The point of going to a wedding is to celebrate the happiness. \n\nActing selfish and being mad about it, especially when you were going to have a party in the future would further prove why you needed to elope in my opinion. \n\nIt isn't like you invite everyone and they were snubbed. It's simply adults acting like children. People can feel how they want about elopement, but you're NTA op. Congratulations!", "You don't \\*owe\\* anyone a wedding!

At the time of telling them we didn't have the date picked out. Once we picked it we only told her and my parents because we didn't want to have to tell a bunch of people why they couldn't come with us to the courthouse.

And the fallout from that will indeed be that you become less close with others. It\u2019s that simple. \n\nA wedding is by nature a social event. Tou can get married and not make it a social event which is what you did but then don\u2019t be surprised when your social circle has bad feelings toward you because it\u2019s clear to them you made a deliberate decision not to include them in something big and important to you. \n\nBut the irony is for you to have your own private ceremony and then post pictures - that will of course hurt feelings. It\u2019s literally announcing to your whole friend and family group that you just did something big that would normally include them, but didn\u2019t.\n\nI mean why post pictures? Social media is by its definition the very nature of social and yet you didn\u2019t want your wedding to be social. *You literally posted social pictures of a nonsocial act.* It\u2019s kind of a bit hypocritical like you want your cake and eat it too. You want all the social  acknowledgment of getting married but you don\u2019t actually want to include anyone else else  in it. \n\nYour choice doesn\u2019t make you an asshole per se, perhaps posting photos of it does, but  it certainly makes you more alienated from those who would\u2019ve been happy to come to your wedding.  \n\nThere is a surprising amount of happiness and goodwill from everyone  in your life in launching you and blessing you in your new life at a wedding. Rituals like this weave and build meaning and connection. It\u2019s sad to miss out on that but you didn\u2019t want that so don\u2019t be surprised when you don\u2019t get it now.

She dragged my grandfather to the rectory and said she was sick and tired of the wedding plan and told the priest to just marry us. Wife's family was a little upset more b/c my MIL and SIL were deprived of input on planning. About 5 years later my FIL thanked me for saving him a ton of money.
