From the beginning her and I decided that we wanted to elope and then have a nice party a little farther down the road so both the families could come and celebrate with us, which we told our families. We decided that our elopement date was going to be on our 5 year anniversary and only told our parents because even though we love our families they can tend to be very opinionated on matters, though we weren't trying to keep it a secret seeing as both sides already knew we were eloping within the year. We planned to tell our families a little later in the month once my wife had updated all of her paperwork. Once we were married my wife posted some of the pictures on Instagram. Nothing huge, just some pictures of her and I smiling and hugging and one of us showing our new rings. Her cousin saw her post and decided she was going to tell everyone on her dad's side of the family. Both her grandmother, aunt and uncle were furious and hurt that we didn\u2019t include them in our special day. They accused us of being selfish, disrespectful, and ungrateful. They said we betrayed their trust and ruined our relationship with them. We tried to explain our reasons and apologize for hurting their feelings, but they wouldn\u2019t listen. They said we owed them an explanation and a proper wedding. They demanded that we have a do-over ceremony with all of them invited. They also threatened to cut us off if we didn\u2019t comply. We also felt that they were being unreasonable and manipulative. We told them that we loved them and wanted them in our lives, but we wouldn\u2019t let them dictate our decisions. They said we were being stubborn and immature, and they hung up on us. We haven\u2019t heard from them since then, and we don\u2019t know if they will ever talk to us again. We are happy with our marriage, but we are sad about losing our families. We don\u2019t think we did anything wrong.

As a couple y\u2019all decided what was important for y\u2019all concerning a day and event that\u2019s about your union. You ensured immediate family about the plans and even went above and beyond by telling your plans of eloping and having a celebration at a later time so all family members could come.\n\nOnly thing that is not mentioned here that could play a part is cultural or religious ideologies that the family has around marriage. But even then you stated y\u2019all\u2019s plans to the family.

Absolutely not.

The relatives can pound sand.", "ESH. It's your marriage, you can do it how you want so their tirade was fairly unreasonable. You guys sucked by posting it to social media before showing any courtesy to the family. I mean what do you think is going to happen when you post it before telling people?", "As a fellow eloper ignore it and don't engage. You can't reason with people that make everything about themselves. I mean they aren't your parents or siblings and even still you don't owe them anything.

Inheritance? Current financial assistance?", "NTA.  You and your wife enjoy each other.  You did it your way.  Forget about her family, they just like drama.  Go on and be happy, they don't pay no bills in your household and have no say in your household. Congratulations and have your nice party later on and do nt invite them.  You owe them nothing.", "YTA for announcing on social media before telling family, if you want that family to remain important in your lives. If you\u2019re indifferent to their presence, NAH.

F that cousin for telling everyone instead of letting you do it. Posting stuff on ig before telling people was probably your only mistake, but once you tell the first person it's likely they'd tell others anyway.\n\nMy bestie eloped on a holiday and made an announcement with pictures when they returned. It was beautiful and special and they didn't tell ANYONE so they're was no claims of special treatment. \nHowever, people still carried on about it. They ended up having a vow renewal/second wedding a year or so later, invited everyone who cracked the shots about missing the first one, and half of them didn't bother coming bc it was out of state. \n\nMy point is, you can't win them all. You did nothing wrong, and throwing a party to celebrate with everyone is a great idea but still won't make everyone happy. Some people just enjoy complaining I think.", "NTA. It's not about your relatives. They think they're entitled to a piece of your wedding, but they're not.", "NTA. Your marriage, your decision. And you said you told both sides that you were going to do this. Whoever is upset that you didn't include them are free to rent a hall, pay for a band and caterer, get an officiant and invite you to come to the event.", "F them, NTA OP, and congratulations!", "NTA\nYou don't need people who walk on earth searching for a reason to hate somebody. They have got the reason, you two got the hate. There is no win with those type of people. Just go forward and take care about yourself.", "NTA. Hubby and I did exactly the same thing. He is not close to his family and they don\u2019t like me. Also his wicked stepmother is the type of woman that goes to family events purely to stir up shit. We told my parents, who we were originally not going to allow to come, as we said if husband\u2019s family isn\u2019t coming, mine shouldn\u2019t be allowed either, but my Dad was devastated and my hubby is a softy lol so they came. My sister also knew prior to the day but was not invited. All in all it was my parents, two witnesses and our daughter. My husband\u2019s family have never forgiven us, in particular his brother. And a great uncle on my side was furious, although we knew even had we had a big wedding he would not have come. You had the day you both wanted and that\u2019s what matters", "NTA and no one is owed a wedding. It is an honour and privilege to be invited and it isn\u2019t something any one is entitled to. It sounds like your family is upset they didn\u2019t get a free party.", "Don\u2019t give any oxygen to the tantrums. If they truly intend to cut you off for having the ceremony you wanted to celebrate your union then people who want to make it about them aren\u2019t really worth running after.\n\nJust completely disregard this whole storm- don\u2019t do anything other than what you intended to do, including inviting the whingers if they were to be invited originally. Make them choose to realise you were always going to have bigger gathering, and sheepishly attend, or not. Use this as a filter to sort the people who genuinely wish you well from those who just wanted to gawk and get drunk on your dollar.\n\nNTA", "NTA the family is veing a hige asshole  have a party and dont invite them and say they said they didnt qant anything tto do qith you and you took that seriously...be petty!", "\"They accused us of being selfish, disrespectful, and ungrateful.\"\nBruh aren't they like that? XD\nNTA ffs", "NTa but they are.  I've eloped twice.  It's the best way.  Saves a lit of money, headache and hassle.", "NTA - what are you being ungrateful for ?", "It was your day. Your day, your way, is the rule. But it was rude to let them find out second-hand.", "Maybe OP could send them some pacifiers and fresh diapers... it would be an appropriate gift given their behaviour.", "There aren't any religious factors involved in their ire. None of her family is really religious and they were very excited when they found out we were eloping and not trying to spend money on a large ceremony.", "Sadly to say yes. These types of things happen a lot, especially when we first started dating.", "All of it. My wife's grandmother is threatening to cut her out of the inheritance and communication. She never helped us financially. My wife really doesn't care because he grandmother has threatened to cut her out most of her life whenever she did something her grandmother \"didn't like\". The problem is when she drags my wife's mother into the picture and tries to blame everything my wife did wrong (according to her grandmother) on my wife's mother.", "I can totally see where you are coming from. Yet, at the same time we never told our parents they weren't allowed to tell any other family members of the date we picked. We chose not to tell Anyone else because we didn't want to hurt feelings by telling them that we didn't want anyone other than our parents at the courthouse. Though I can see how her posting some of the pictures could make us seem like an asshole.", "They're not on their butts.  They're sulking and pouting at home.  Having a good old-fashioned temper tantrum.\n\nNTA from me.", "Are you absolutely sure that it's a bad thing for them to not be talking to you anymore? I don't know about you, but... if this is the way they are, you might find that you enjoy the peace and quiet... and absense of insanity.", "Lets be honest if you guys chose to have kids can you imagine how big if a nightmare would be? Everything would be about them and refuse to follow any boundaries.", "Then do yourself a favor and don\u2019t respond to their antics.  If they can draw you into their drama they will. There\u2019s no winning with people like that. \n\nNTA and best wishes.", "If it's enough money for you two to play the role of the jester for the next few years, go for it. If it's not, tell her to make sure her casket is big enough to take her wealth with her. NTA.", "**This too shall pass** \\- King Solomon", "NTA, you announced to the world that you were married. Just because they weren\u2019t special in the event is the reason why they are hurt. The wedding/elopement is your day of your choosing\u2026 not theirs.", "Can I busk my accordion at your wedding party?", "I 100% agree, as does my wife. The problem is her grandmother likes to pull her mother into it and try and make it out to be her mother's fault when it was my wife and I decision on when we eloped.", "Not your job to bend over backwards to heal mom's relationship with a toxic crazy person. \n\nWhen people tell you who they are, repeatedly and clearly,  believe them. Stand your ground."]}
