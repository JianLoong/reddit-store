You should not be shocked at hurt feelings. ESH", "NTA. When my ex and I married we literally had only our parents there and then just told everyone about it afterwards. I hate being the centre of attention and couldn't imagine anything worse than having loads of people staring at me, and my ex had already had the 'big wedding' and didn't really care what we did. A couple of family members did ask why they weren't invited, but when we said it was to save them having to buy gifts for an impromptu wedding just before Christmas they stopped complaining.", "I give them until the OP announces a pregnancy and then the family will magically want to be involved again.\n\nOn that note, if you comply then you\u2019re setting the tone and expectations for every personal milestone for the rest of your lives.", "Do they even know how much a wedding costs? If they want that sort of party, they can pay for one themselves and invite you as guests!", "I can see why your wife wanted to elope", "So you're sad that you're losing contact with controlling people who don't actually care about what you want? You've really lost nothing here.", "Then it is timw for you to set the record straight. This is your realtionship, they have cero say. If you give in, be prepare for them sticking their noses in your marriage and probably ruin it. This is your marriage. You didnt do anything wrong", "Wouldn't matter even if there were. It's your and your wife life and wedding not THEIRS ffs. NTA", "Tell them that you don't have money for a ceremony so eloped, but if they want to foot the full bill for a big ceremony, you'll invite them.", "They are stupid. Ignore them and move along. The more emphasis you pay to them the worse for you two.", "Then it\u2019s not your wife\u2019s responsibility.  It\u2019s her mother\u2019s responsibility to set her own boundaries with the grandmother.  This is not about your elopement.  This is about generations of control and manipulation.  Don\u2019t let it to taint another generation.  Walk away.  \nWhy has your wife\u2019s father not stepped up? Sounds like he\u2019s allowed this abuse against his wife for decades.", "This should be the top comment.   NTA", "You know, you have to stop apologising.  Only apologise if you have done something wrong.\n\nYou have not done anything wrong. You apologising plays straight in to their petty little games."]}
