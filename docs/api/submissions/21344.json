We had been together since high school. Since then , I haven't not dated anyone or gotten into any relationship and I still have no interest in dating. I have a group of close friends from college that we still meet and hang out together from time to time. So one time , a girl ( lets call her Emily ) came with us. I have met Emily a couple of times before that , she seemed a nice girl. But this time I noticed that my friends were really pushing things in a strange way. They made comments about how I should start dating again, tried to leave me and her alone as much as possible.  The whole thing made me uncomfortable.  So I later asked them about this and they said that Emily told them that she liked me and would like to know me more. They also said they are worried about me  and that  it had been 5 years now . I should start to at least open the door to a relationship again and try to move forward. I told them that I appreciate their worries but no I don't want to date and they shouldn't  give Emily any false hopes. I also don't want this setting me up thing  to happen again and next time I won't be nice about it.\n\nSo last week, emily comes again and they  try the same thing again. So I told her \" I don't know what  they told you. You are a nice and beautiful  girl, but you shouldn't waste your time on me because nothing is gonna come out of this. I am sorry but I have no interest  in dating you \".  She apologized, started to cry and left. \n\nMy friends  called me an AH for that.  I told them that it was their fault that this happened. I already told them before to not to try this again. They said that  if I continue like this, I will be continue  to  be alone. They are just trying  to help me.

I feel bad for the girl, but that's on them not you and you can't make yourself have feelings for someone. If you're not ready, you're simply not ready. If they keep pushing, reevaluate these friendships.", "NTA, you were honest and told her in a kind respectful manner. I wouldn't want to waste my time either. It's not like you guys couldn't just be friends. You'll date when you're ready. Your friends however definitely need to accept your boundaries. They in fact are T A.", "NTA.  Once you realized what was going on, you gave them fair warning to tell Emily.  Unfortunately, your friends' brains have been washed by Hollywood romcoms.", "NTA. They were told, they ignored, you followed through. Their problem is their own. I'm in my mid 40s and I've been single for 20yrs. Different reason, but I love my life and the freedom I have. If you do meet someone, awesome, if you don't awesome. Go at your own pace and don't let other people's insecurities influence you. Best of luck.", "NTA.  You're not ready to date, and your friends know that.  You were honest and straightforward.", "NTA. You were honest about your feelings for Emily in a gentle way. Thats fine that your friends have concerns but you were very clear on your boundaries and interests in waiting to date. They\u2019re assholes for continuing to be persistent even after you\u2019ve explained yourself and for telling you you\u2019ll be alone.", "NTA. Your friend's reaction to this is super gross and toxic. You were not unclear with them and they easily could have let her know that you were a no, but even on top of that your rejection was perfectly reasonable. The fact that she was upset about it doesn't mean you did anything wrong. Your disinterest in dating is 100% your business and if they're actually concerned about the timeline of your grief, trying to shove you into a relationship with someone is hardly a caring way to express it.", "NTA. You were kind when you told her.  They lead her on and they should apologize to both of you. Just because you don't have or want a partner doesn't mean you are lonely. You can have a very full life without being attached to someone. I wish you well.", "NTA", "NTA. Your friends should mind their own businesses. You handled it good.", "You are definitely not the AH! Your friends are. They should have never done such a thing. It is none of their business if you date anytime soon or never.  I am a widow and I would have shut that whole thing with dating, down when it first happened. To anyone out there thinking your family member or friend needs to move on after a death, go away! Lost my husband 4 years ago and I am perfectly happy being alone and with my dogs. I could easily be in a relationship if I wanted to, but I don\u2019t. After a death of someone who was part of you, that grief goes on for different periods of time for each person. When that person is ready, more than likely they will ask about dating and such. So for now, stop trying to set people up and making a mess out of things for two innocent people. Good luck OP. I get where you are coming from and sorry for your loss.", "NTA. You were gracious in letting the woman know how you felt. Your friends put her in that position by not respecting your boundaries. \n\nYou're not ready. You may never be ready. It's not for other people to decide for you. My guess is that she got upset because they filled her head with their own romantic movie endings.", "NTA .  \"Your gonna end up alone , \" Say thank you that's what I want!", "NTA for what you said to your friends, I would\u2019ve been a lot harsher.

If you'd said, \"Ihave no interest in dating right now,\" it might've gone over a little better.  \"I have no interest in dating you,\" is far more targetting and makes her feel like you might be interested in dating someone else.", "NTA your friends are dicks. And you said you wouldn\u2019t be nice about it next time. I had a much different impression of how it would go. You had a lot more grace in your actions than I would have in that situation. It\u2019s not your fault she cried. There isn\u2019t a way you could\u2019ve addressed what they were doing without clearing the air publicly so they couldn\u2019t try to secretly push the issue more, AGAIN, AFTER being explicitly told not to. Fuck those people. Sorry Emily got her feelings hurt but it\u2019s not about her.", "NTA. It's insane that they *know* you're mourning your partner of a decade or more and are mad you're not folding to their unasked for matchmaking attempts.\n\nOnce was rude enough (even without your history, who the fuck just *decides* their friend must partner up with their pick, without saying anything about it beforehand??), but to keep pushing this woman onto you is straight up disrespectful of your explicit wishes. What, if you had been together for 20 years, 30, *then* you could decide to be alone without being bashed for your choice? Or because you're young, oh no, you **must** be in a relationship??\n\nYou were kind to Emily because she wasn't malicious - your friends though... bordering, to be honest. Whatever good reasons they *may* have had, crumbled the moment you told them to back off and they did not. You can be concerned for a friend without bashing them, without trying to walk all over them, and certainly without getting *mad* because their manipulation didn't work.\n\nWhat, will they tell you to apologize to Emily next? Get out of here.", "NTA, you were honest and nice about it. You can't force yourself to feel something for someone and neither can your friends. 5 years is a long time to grieve at such a young age but so what? You were together a long time and grief had no time limit. You will be ready when you are ready and not a minute before.", "This right here, OP!! I never understand why people think you have to be married or you'll end up alone. As if other family and friends don't exist.\n\nNothing wrong with being single and wanting to stay that way!", "NTA at all. I would rather he be up front and honest with me than let his friends lead me on.", "Maybe OP has realized that being in a relationship just isn't something that interests him right now. He doesn't have to move on because of some time scale made by others.", "He has moved on.  What are you missing?", "Maybe OP will finally be ready to date when he's 50 and realize he wasted his 30s and 40s.   Mourning should not be a lifestyle or a habit", "Per OP \" I still have no interest in dating\" \n\nThat's not moving on. OP is stuck.\n\nThis is what you are missing", "Or maybe he is happy on his own. Not everyone needs someone to be happy.", "Maybe he isn't interested in dating, there's nothing wrong with not wanting to date at some points.", "You miss the fact that not everybody dates.\nHe has friends, he hangs out, he has a social life.", "I'm aware of the obvious.   \n\nOP's phrasing connects the lack of dating to the loss of his GF.   Is the  turn of phrase he uses unclear to you?", "Dating is not a requirement for happiness,joy, or contentment, or anything else.", "NTA. You told them you were not interested and not to push it.  They pushed, and didn't tell her the truth. THEY caused her to be hurt by pushing you two together.", "Honestly how dare they try to control your personal relationships like that. How do they not realize that's a massive overstep? \n\nNTA", "YTA. \n\nYou might know this but people don't move on from their feelings instantly... why would you meet up with her (and your friends) again?\n\nDon't blame your friends, people don't like others that are different than them.", "NTA. Your friends disrespected your boundaries by refusing to listen and you just told this woman the truth in a polite way.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriends\u201d suck ass.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong and were honest. \nShe likely had other stuff going on to take rejection that hard. \n\nAnd your friends kinda suck for pushing that. Whether or not you choose to date again is entirely your decision. If they are that worried about you, they should try to set you up with a therapist, not a gf. Their choice here was immature and what caused the hurt feelings.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you are doing ok all things considered. \n\nYou told your friends what would happen if they tried pushing the issue again and you told Emily the truth in the kindest way you could have. There is literally no way for you to be TA in this situation unless you had a very rude tone or something, but by the way you described it, you handed the situation perfectly. \n\nI wish you the best!", "NTA", "NTA but are you not dating because you are just enjoying the single life or still having a hard time grieving your late partner? Because 5 years is a little long. My husband passed away in Dec of 2018 and while he still crosses my mind, I\u2019ve found my new normal years ago at this point. \n\nI was just curious though. If you just aren\u2019t interested in dating that\u2019s one thing, but if it\u2019s still because of her I hope you get some counseling or something.", "He didn't, she came up to him and his friends", "YTA.  \u201cI have no interest in dating YOU.\u201d  That you made you a giant A.  The truth was you have no interest in dating.", "NTA. emily\u2019s feelings are hurt, which is to be expected after being hyped up and encouraged to shoot your shoot and being rejected. but i\u2019m sure most people would prefer an outright rejection (especially one as nice as you did) than to be strung on for weeks/months/years and be told they wasted that time for nothing. you did the right thing, if you\u2019re ready to explore relationships later. all the power to you. if you\u2019re not. all the power to you again. but you seem to be comfortable in yourself and addressed both friends and emily in a respectful way", "NTA  and neither is Emily. Being honest and upfront was actually a kindness.  It's your friend that mislead her that are AHs. But maybe they are still good friends.", "Nta, wtf? You were honest, and kind. Your friends aren't helping by pushing shit you don't want at you", "NTA\nI have 0 interest in dating, never have and I doubt I ever will. I'm just not interested in people like that, and I think if I had friends who tried to push me into dating someone I'd be pretty upset pretty fast.\nThe only one who can decide when or if they want to pursue a relationship with another person is You. If your life is otherwise happy or content, and you don't feel the need to date, then don't!\nYour friends pushed too hard and are the ones to blame for hurting Emily's feelings. You were as polite as you could be in the situation!", "NTA\n\nYou warned them and they pushed her on you anyway, and it sounds like they gave her false hopes. \n\n5 years for me, too. There's no right, no wrong way to grieve, no timetable. I don't understand why people seem to think you should be \"over it\". I don't know about you, but I'll never be over it. I had one love. Period. I've had to cut some people off for trying similar things.\n\nI'm so sorry that you're having to deal with this. I hope they get a clue.", "NTA. I'm surprised Emily cried.", "NTA. Her crying probably had more to do with her own embarrassment (made worse by friends encouraging her to pursue you) than the way you rejected her.  It\u2019s an awkward situation, and that\u2019s probably the best outcome possible. \n\nYour friends need to respect your boundaries. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "Fucking people. OP NTA. You will date when you\u2019re ready. You are your own person. I hate that your whole friend group is trying to tell you what is best for you in terms of a relationship. You had a relationship of more than 10 years (because math) which ended because of death. They don\u2019t get to dictate how you handle it. If they were good friends they\u2019d listen to you. I get they want what\u2019s best for you but what\u2019s best is they listen to what it is you need. Not what they think you need.", ">I am sorry but I have no interest  in dating you \".  She apologized, started to cry and left.\n\nNTA - for the way you handled Emily. But you probably need some help resolving the grief you have over your GF. You weren't married, didn't have kids and you don't say whether you were living together. At 32 you are too young just to crawl into a hole for the rest of your life. Some grief counseling might help.", "You are an awful person. Mods feel free to delete my comment for being uncivil", "There is no time line for greif or when you should \"get over it\" That partner may have been the love of his life and doesnt want anyone else and thats completly fine! Op sounds content being single and should be allowed to live how he chooses. It doesn't matter  if they were married or had kids, loss of a loved one would be horrific. Let Op be.", "Are those the arbitrary devices you use to gauge the validity of love?", "Disagree.  She was being told other stuff and how was she to know what they told her was wrong.  If he said he was not interested in dating, fine.  But he said he is not interested in dating her.  That\u2019s not something he needed to say.  It was rude to the wrong person.  The ones setting him up are the ones that should be called out.", "I don't attack people who disagree with me."]}
