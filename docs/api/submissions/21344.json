We had been together since high school. Since then , I haven't not dated anyone or gotten into any relationship and I still have no interest in dating. I have a group of close friends from college that we still meet and hang out together from time to time. So one time , a girl ( lets call her Emily ) came with us. I have met Emily a couple of times before that , she seemed a nice girl. But this time I noticed that my friends were really pushing things in a strange way. They made comments about how I should start dating again, tried to leave me and her alone as much as possible.  The whole thing made me uncomfortable.  So I later asked them about this and they said that Emily told them that she liked me and would like to know me more. They also said they are worried about me  and that  it had been 5 years now . I should start to at least open the door to a relationship again and try to move forward. I told them that I appreciate their worries but no I don't want to date and they shouldn't  give Emily any false hopes. I also don't want this setting me up thing  to happen again and next time I won't be nice about it.\n\nSo last week, emily comes again and they  try the same thing again.

I am sorry but I have no interest  in dating you \".  She apologized, started to cry and left. \n\nMy friends  called me an AH for that.  I told them that it was their fault that this happened. I already told them before to not to try this again. They said that  if I continue like this, I will be continue  to  be alone. They are just trying  to help me.

I feel bad for the girl, but that's on them not you and you can't make yourself have feelings for someone. If you're not ready, you're simply not ready. If they keep pushing, reevaluate these friendships.", "NTA, you were honest and told her in a kind respectful manner. I wouldn't want to waste my time either. It's not like you guys couldn't just be friends. You'll date when you're ready. Your friends however definitely need to accept your boundaries. They in fact are T A.", "NTA.  Once you realized what was going on, you gave them fair warning to tell Emily.  Unfortunately, your friends' brains have been washed by Hollywood romcoms.", "NTA. They were told, they ignored, you followed through. Their problem is their own. I'm in my mid 40s and I've been single for 20yrs. Different reason, but I love my life and the freedom I have. If you do meet someone, awesome, if you don't awesome. Go at your own pace and don't let other people's insecurities influence you. Best of luck.", "NTA.  You're not ready to date, and your friends know that.  You were honest and straightforward.", "NTA. You were honest about your feelings for Emily in a gentle way. Thats fine that your friends have concerns but you were very clear on your boundaries and interests in waiting to date. They\u2019re assholes for continuing to be persistent even after you\u2019ve explained yourself and for telling you you\u2019ll be alone.", "NTA. Your friend's reaction to this is super gross and toxic. You were not unclear with them and they easily could have let her know that you were a no, but even on top of that your rejection was perfectly reasonable. The fact that she was upset about it doesn't mean you did anything wrong. Your disinterest in dating is 100% your business and if they're actually concerned about the timeline of your grief, trying to shove you into a relationship with someone is hardly a caring way to express it.", "NTA. You were kind when you told her.  They lead her on and they should apologize to both of you. Just because you don't have or want a partner doesn't mean you are lonely. You can have a very full life without being attached to someone. I wish you well.", "NTA", "NTA. Your friends should mind their own businesses. You handled it good.", "You are definitely not the AH! Your friends are. They should have never done such a thing. It is none of their business if you date anytime soon or never.  I am a widow and I would have shut that whole thing with dating, down when it first happened. To anyone out there thinking your family member or friend needs to move on after a death, go away! Lost my husband 4 years ago and I am perfectly happy being alone and with my dogs. I could easily be in a relationship if I wanted to, but I don\u2019t. After a death of someone who was part of you, that grief goes on for different periods of time for each person. When that person is ready, more than likely they will ask about dating and such. So for now, stop trying to set people up and making a mess out of things for two innocent people. Good luck OP. I get where you are coming from and sorry for your loss.", "NTA. You were gracious in letting the woman know how you felt. Your friends put her in that position by not respecting your boundaries. \n\nYou're not ready. You may never be ready. It's not for other people to decide for you. My guess is that she got upset because they filled her head with their own romantic movie endings.", "NTA .  \"Your gonna end up alone , \" Say thank you that's what I want!", "NTA for what you said to your friends, I would\u2019ve been a lot harsher.
