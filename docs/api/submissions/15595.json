I work out a lot and generally tall (205cm). Compared to me my fianc\u00e9e Sarah is literally tiny and I can easily let her sit on my shoulders for the entire concert. Because of my height we usually try to travel in business, however Sarah had a family emergency and there was no business class, so we opted out for economy seats with extra leg room for 8 hour flight.\n\nNow the window seat was occupied by a passenger who happened to be overweight. I'm really not the one to judge as I was there myself. So Sarah sat in the middle seat while I took the aisle.\n\nAfter the take off Sarah started to behave strangely. Usually she barely gets up on a flight and falls asleep, but this time she would constantly (every 10 minutes) get up for a walk and \"to stretch her legs\". About an hour into the flight I have asked her what's wrong and she confessed she was feeling claustrophobic and very squished in her seat. I have suggested we can swap seats and she agreed.\n\nWhen I took her seat I could tell the man in a window seat wasn't comfortable as he had to stop leaning into the middle seat, since I take significantly more space compared to Sarah. About half way through the flight he has started complaining he is not comfortable and asking me to change seats with Sarah, who was deeply asleep by then due to all the stress. I have refused and suggested if he is not comfortable sitting in one seat he should buy 2 seats next time. The guy has tried to call a stewardess and complain but she told him the same thing.\n\nAt the end of the flight the guy called me an asshole and cursed me out. I don't think I did anything wrong here, however we just got back home and my mum also thinks I behaved like an asshole.", "created_utc": 1682364719, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xtiyt/aita_for_suggesting_an_overweight_passenger_to/", "score": 564, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Funny how he insisted on making your gf uncomfortable in order to gain his comfort.", "NTA. If he was uncomfortable because he couldn't squish your wife anymore, he's clearly the size of person who should buy two seats. It's not uncommon. That was very nice of you to take care of your wife like that.", "I find it interesting that the gentleman was letting it all hang out and invade her space when she was sitting next to him, but when it was a dude he reigned it back in and got huffy.  I think this was about more than just seat space.", "\"The guy has tried to call a stewardess and complain but she told him the same thing.\"\n\nThere is your answer.  The stewardess saw the situation and immediately agreed with you.\n\nNTA  However, the biggest AH is airlines making seats smaller and aisles narrower to cram more passengers in.", "He took up a stranger's personal space (that they paid for) and then expected someone to wake up said stranger to put her back in a physically and emotionally uncomfortable position for his own comfort. NTA", "NTA and who wants a strange man leaning on  your fiance.", "NTA- if someone is too large to sit in their own seat without taking up part of the one next to theirs, they need to purchase two seats. The fact that he asked you to change back the seats shows that he was taking up a lot of her space, which she and you paid for. \n\nI understand flights are expensive and plus size people do need to fly. But they cannot expect that they will be able to take up part of the seat next to them any time they fly.", "NTA\n\nSo he was capable of staying in his own space the whole time and he only didn't when there was a petite woman next to him? He's a major AH. Airline seats are unreasonably small, but he needs to complain to the airline, buy an aisle seat, or purchase extra room because he should already know this. Being gross to the person next to you is unacceptable. \n\nInstead he chose to bully your wife. He fucked around and he found out.", "NTA. And you are a hero to be uncomfortable, so your wife can be comfortable.", "As a petite person who has had this exact situation done to me in the past, several times - THANK YOU OP for sticking up for your GF. \n\nNTA NTA NTA.", "NTA at all. What an ass, asking you to switch seats with your wife, because she is easier to squash for him than you. How dare he put his bulk on top of someone else in the seat that person paid for! You are right. If someone does not fit into one seat he should buy two, or ask for another seat next to an empty one. And is there is none, he should get on the next flight (or put on the next one by the crew). Under no circumstance you should tolerate someone who squashes you in the seat you paid for.", "NTA.\n\nHe has plenty of options that doesn't involve other people sacrificing for his comfort.", "NTA.  He has no reasonable expectation for others to squeeze to make him comfortable. He really did need a reminder that if he's uncomfortable with his seating, the buy two seats option still exists. Depending on fare structure, a first class seat might be cheaper than two seats.", "NTA.\n\nAnd thank you for standing up for your GF.", "NTA. if someone has to take up any space of the seat next to them in order to be comfortable, they should buy two seats.", "NTA - He wanted others to accommodate his comfort level.

Thank you for standing up for her", "NTA, he should have taken the initiative", "NTA. Yeah, airplane seats mostly suck, but that is no excuse to take up part of someone else's seat.", "NTA though to be fair, I read recently (when that overweight influencer was complaining about wanting a free seat, which\u2026 ugh) that airlines don\u2019t make it easy for people to buy two seats and even if they manage it, since flights are so often overbooked, those seats can still end up being taken by overflow passengers. \n\nBut of course this guy was a jerk about it. It\u2019s not your fault he\u2019s overweight nor should your GF be squeezed out of her seat.", "NTA. I feel for the guy, as the world isn't really built with wider people in mind, especially because transportation businesses are focused on cramming as many people into a plane as possible for more profit. That being said, just because someone takes up more space, doesn't mean they are entitled to invade others' personal space. And his resorting to name calling and childish insults definitely doesn't earn him any sympathy points.", "NTA. As a petite woman I used to fly somewhat often, alone, for work. Who would always book for me, I couldn't edit my tickets at all or upgrade. I kid you not, I've had at least 5 different occasions of obese men \"falling asleep\" on me, invading my space, breathing on me. I legit started to have panic attacks after the second time it happened, thankfully the Flight Attendants always understood and moved me without issue. And after that, I got proactive about it as soon as the first time my space was invaded, I'd ask to be moved. It was always granted. I was never rude but my seat mate certainly always knew why I was being moved and I think that's part of it. Maybe they really just didn't give a shit or they wanted me to move so the seat would be empty for them and they would be purposefully obnoxious. Idk. But I hate it. Nothing against fat people, but ffs buy two seats! And it's also the Airline's responsibility to enforce this.", "NTA\n\nYou did not antagonize this man. He literally suggested that your fianc\u00e9 sit beside him so he could knowingly encroach on her space.", "NTA - maybe not the best thing to say, but you weren\u2019t wrong.", "NTA. Sitting next to morbidly obese people on planes sucks. Their ass covers 2 seats, charge them double if they want on.", "NTA in my opinion. It doesn\u2019t sound like you said it in a rude way and if sitting in one seat is really that uncomfortable for the guy then maybe he does need to consider the option of buying two. However we don\u2019t know his circumstances and he may not be able to afford two seats. I think it may have been different if he had asked you to switch seats if your wife was still awake but it\u2019s obvious you weren\u2019t going to wake her to switch especially after she\u2019d been so stressed.", "NTA - he was using a space paid by you and then complained when his free ride ended. Too bad for him. However keep in mind that while most airlines allow for second seat purchase that is not true everywhere", "NTA He just wanted to be able to make your gf uncomfortable and take up her space.", "Tentatively NTA. I would say it depends on how you responded. As a (horizontally) bigger guy myself, I know it\u2019s uncomfortable on flights simply because the seats are pretty small. However, that doesn\u2019t entitle you to someone else\u2019s space. If you are truly too big for one seat, get two or accept that you won\u2019t be comfortable the whole time", "NTA\n\nI blame the airlines for this to an extent too for having made seats smaller and smaller even as people have gotten larger and larger over the years. The airlines need to do a better job about requiring that people above a certain weight actually buy two seats. They are well aware that they are squishing the people in the next seat when they don't and they simply don't care. We have stopped flying and just drive when we travel.

I have chosen to be on the aisle seat so I can have a bit more wiggle room and stretch my legs in the corridor when empty and if the space between the seats is too small for me to fit in and we also paid extra for the seats and to be next to each other.\n\nNow Sarah is usually asleep most of the time on my shoulder and doesn't really have a problem with people taking some of her seat as she remembers the times I was significantly heavier (500+lbs).

Travel got soooo much better when I married my 6'1\" husband who has the worst case of mean resting b\\*tch face ever.", "I've also found that men seem to feel entitled to me as their conversational partner the whole flight too. \n\nNo.", "Same as a woman who has to travel for work a lot I'm here to say when someone's crowding my space it's never another woman.", "I used to be very skinny and some guy reclined his seat onto my chest and I could not breathe. I was even reclined a little, his seat was on my chest.  Luckily, he and another passenger got into an argument and ended switching seats and the new guy didn't recline.", "They are.  I traveled heavily for work from 2010 through 2020, and just in that time I saw a major airline make at least 2 seat design and row changes on most of the airplane types of theirs that I used.   Narrower seats and rows.    They rhyme with Smunited Bairlines.  I'm only 5'9\", and I feel cramped these days.", "If it takes two seats to make you comfortable, then you absolutely should have to pay for both of those seats.", "He asked if she could move back because he felt more comfortable invading a woman's space than that of another man.", "Not really. This guy knew perfectly well that he did not fit in a standard seat, but he bought one and speculated on the passenger next to him move in another non-occupied seat so he could have extra space for free. But that did not happen as the plane apparently had all seats occupied. He's lucky you didn't have him put on the next flight because he was invading the space you paid for.", "It\u2019s that and also typically guys feel more comfortable being an AH when someone is smaller than them. Men and women included. If OP was his GFs size he would\u2019ve done the same to him", "If he accidentally brushes a guy's knee, he'll catch the gay.", "Not every 6\u2019 290lb person has the same body shape.", "I have a cousin that needed two seats one for each cheek", "My biggest issue is my hips, I'm very much a pear shape and have the bulk of my weight is in my hips and thighs. I'm 5'7\", 260 lbs, with 52\" hips. Even when I was pregnant, my waist never got bigger than my hips. So losing weight doesn't do much for being uncomfortable on airplanes cause even when I was thinner my hips were still apparently enormous. I remember a flight on a smaller plane where I had a bruise on my hip from the built in armrests. But I can't afford a second ticket when just 1 was almost $2000, and I only needed another inch, 2 max, not a whole other seat. Thankfully I was sitting next to a very nice woman that I had a good chat with after getting over the weirdness of our thighs touching.", "[deleted]", "They can and will bump just one of the seats of a person who bought two, though. They don't care.", "THAT's the key bit of info we are missing here in the original post! If he can't fit into the seat with the armrest down, he needed to buy more than one seat.", "Man that sucks for him, doesn\u2019t it? Lower the arm rest, you rented half of it. If he wants to keep it up, he could\u2019ve rented the whole arm rest and bought two tickets. Or an aisle seat.\n\nIf he can\u2019t even fit in the arm rest, he\u2019s taking more space than he rented.", "I think there are quite a few airlines that have policies stating that if the armrest doesn\u2019t go all the way you either need to pay for another seat, or deplane if that is not possible.", "Never said they weren't", "That\u2019s why I think it would\u2019ve been better to just say sorry I moved because my gf wasn\u2019t comfortable. She didn\u2019t have enough space. That would\u2019ve avoided an argument", "Maybe the guy couldn\u2019t afford two seats. Either way, calling him out was just going to create an argument.", "The fat guy is an adult and understands buying and selling. There was no question he was aware of the option to buy two seats.  Just like how the OP couldn\u2019t afford business class; maybe he couldn\u2019t afford to buy two seats.  Maybe he couldn\u2019t find two seats together. \n\n\nOP could\u2019ve easily stood up for his girlfriend without being a dick. Just because you feel like you have them moral right to do something, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always the best thing to do.  Trapped on a flight with the guy for 8 hours.  No reason to create drama.", "OP was also the asshole for his comment about buying two seats.", "Just because he opened himself up to it doesn\u2019t  mean that OP should have said it. What is the point of getting into a spat with a guy on an eight hour flight?", "And it was unnecessary.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "The dude is an AH but was he harassing her? He harassed OP during the discussion but it seems like he just infringed on her space by existing which is an AH move when he leaned into it but not really harassment.", "OP said that when they switched seats the other passenger could no longer lean into the middle seat. Even if he wasn't touching her he was pretty close.", "Every flight that I have to sit next to a man 100% ends with their knees well into my side of the seat and their arms taking the entire arm rest.

I can\u2019t imagine being as tall as you and dealing with how cramped it is.", "These airlines doing this is going to be in BBC a bind if they crash because people will die trying to get everyone off. They made compact cars and the jaws of life are needed far morel than they used to be. Same concept just with more people dying.", "Really? I'm 6'2\" and find united to be the best of the major us carriers.", "Southwest airlines with give you an additional seat for free if you just ask. For persons of size.", "Not necessarily. As previously stated, airlines are making seats smaller. Also, I feel like this comes from a place of blaming the person for being too large to fit in a single seat, which isn't necessarily true.\n\nAnd lastly, there are times when airlines will refuse to let you have an extra seat despite paying for it.\n\nAirlines are assholes, basically.", "She was asleep! How was that bullying her?", "I think you meant to respond to r/PsilosirenRose above me?  Or  the  OP?", "I still fail to see how someone that's 6ft and 290lbs couldn't fit into a normal chair unless they carry 200 lbs on their ass", "My aunt Barbara definitely needed two seats.

Rest her soul.", "I think they agree with your judgement but disagree where you say\n\n>I think it may have been different if he had asked you to switch seats if your wife was still awake\n\nImo OP still wouldn't have been TA if his wife had been awake when he said no because it's not fair for the other guy to gain comfort at the expense of someone else", "This", "His inability to afford two seats doesn\u2019t mean he gets to take the space someone else paid for which is what he was doing. OP and GF don\u2019t need to subsidize this guys flight by giving up the space THEY paid for.", "Except it wasn\u2019t the OP who created drama, it was the other passenger, who should have realized exactly why the woman didn\u2019t want to sit next to him anymore.  His lack of ability to buy two seats doesn\u2019t give him the right to encroach on someone else.  The OP wouldn\u2019t have said a word, and would have just suffered in the middle seat to keep his stressed out fianc\u00e9e calm.  The \u201cfat guy\u201d as you called him is who decided to make it an issue.", "And the alternative is?", "Idk maybe don\u2019t complain when you know you are the root cause of the issue?

She should be entitled to the space she payed for. I think the only princess here is the larger man who asked him to move.", "She fit in her seat.", "Sure but that would go for the future. Plus, how was OP supposed to know that someone larger would be sitting there? Works better if the person who is larger purchases an extra seat if need be.", "Yes, and? He's obviously an asshole, but I dont see anything creepy.", "Absolutely true, I was only reclined a bit like a couple inches (I have a condition where I'm not comfortable leaned back) and he was right on my chest. It was so uncomfortable. Maybe, the seat was old, it was over 20 years ago, unsure how far they used to recline. All I know is, he was a very large man and was right on me.", "You may literally be standing.", "Consumers have to be willing to pay more, and so far they're not.  As long as price is literally the only thing customers are sensitive to, we'll continue to see a race to the bottom from airlines.", "Do they use more than one type of jet?  You may have flown in an older model with more leg room.", "Yes necessarily.  If you take up more than one seat you should buy more than one seat.", "She was sleeping because when she was in her original seat, she was too cramped even to relax. Dude wanted to subject her to more of that because he wasn't as comfortable pushing a man out of his seat compared to a woman.", "No, I did mean to react to your statement that this was not a case of FAFO. I disagreed because the guy counted on getting away with buying only one seat, expecting the plane not being fully booked.", "Agreed in which case he could still say no he\u2019s not switching but I was stating that by asking while she was asleep he literally expected him to wake her up to switch with her which is entirely unreasonable to expect that", "I never said they did. I just said he did not need to make the common about buying two seats.", "And OP decided to play tit for tat. Not an adult with handling things. Not sure what your issue is with me calling a fat guy fat.", "Not making the comment?", "Sure.  But no need to be a jerk. Two assholes instead of one.", "I'm guessing their toll is one additional seat on the plane", "I saw that one and I was furious bastards actually proposed that shit \ud83e\udd2c", "You are really reaching. He wanted more room, of course he would rather have a small woman than a large man sitting in the middle seat. You absolutely don\u2019t know that he was a bully, he was asking for a solution.", "How is that disagreeing with what I said?", "I just don\u2019t see any reason why OP needed to avoid mentioning the obvious solution which even the flight attendant repeated.  He didn\u2019t insult the guy.  He didn\u2019t swear.  He didn\u2019t raise his voice (his fianc\u00e9e remained sleeping).  He just told the guy what he should do if he doesn\u2019t want to be in that situation in the future.  Was the guy already aware?  Maybe, maybe not.  It\u2019s not OPs job to be a mind reader.  He sounds perfectly adult to me - far more adult than the guy who called a flight attendant over to try to get OP to switch seats with a SLEEPING WOMAN.", "The alternative is to accept blame from the overweight passenger.  \n\n  \nNo, the passenger needed a dose of reality.  His demanded OP switch seats with his asleep gf and then had the gall to call a flight attendant over to force OP to do the same.  \n\nOP didnt jeer at or necessarily disrespect the man for his weight. He told the truth and stood up for himself when put into that situation by the passenger", "As a fat man, I do not see OP as a jerk. He gave a good suggestion and the guy had a hissy fit.", "Here's an idea: As a small woman, I STILL don't want you in my personal space. GTFO. He has NO RIGHT to \"extra\" space. It's not extra; it's my seat and I paid for it. \n\nThe solution is buying two seats.", "I'm not American so maybe I don't understand the exact meaning of Fuck around and Find out. My interpretation is doing something stupid and have to face the consequences. Is that correct?\n\nSo my interpretation of this situation is that the fat guy deliberately bought less space than he needed, expecting he'll get to sit next to an empty seat he'll have for free (= fuck around). He found out that did not work when the plane was fully occupied.", "He didn\u2019t have to accept any blame.", "It wasn\u2019t a good suggestion at all. The guy was not in a position to buy two seats because the plane was already inflight.", "And the passenger didnt have to blame OP .\n\nTruth is, OP was likely incensed by the man inability to contain himself in his own seat, by virtue of his large size.  \n\nId be already mad and starting the conversation on the wrong foot with someone like the passenger when he demanded that I switch seats with my gf.  \n\nNo, you imposed on my gf for an hour and made her uncomfortable by squishing her in her own seat.  To the point she had to get up just to escape claustrophobia due to your large presence.  Now, your sense of entitlement leads you to demand I accommodate you even further and put my gf back into the very seat that you felt ok to intrude upon at her expense.  No sir, you need a dose of reality and these requests & this behavior stops right here.", "Then don\u2019t fly if you know you will uncomfortable \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Sure.  But that wasn\u2019t the question.", "And? You kept saying that the guy wasn\u2019t in a position to buy two seats so I went off of what you said.
