About an hour into the flight I have asked her what's wrong and she confessed she was feeling claustrophobic and very squished in her seat. I have suggested we can swap seats and she agreed.\n\nWhen I took her seat I could tell the man in a window seat wasn't comfortable as he had to stop leaning into the middle seat, since I take significantly more space compared to Sarah. About half way through the flight he has started complaining he is not comfortable and asking me to change seats with Sarah, who was deeply asleep by then due to all the stress. I have refused and suggested if he is not comfortable sitting in one seat he should buy 2 seats next time.

The stewardess saw the situation and immediately agreed with you.\n\nNTA  However, the biggest AH is airlines making seats smaller and aisles narrower to cram more passengers in.", "He took up a stranger's personal space (that they paid for) and then expected someone to wake up said stranger to put her back in a physically and emotionally uncomfortable position for his own comfort. NTA", "NTA and who wants a strange man leaning on  your fiance.", "NTA- if someone is too large to sit in their own seat without taking up part of the one next to theirs, they need to purchase two seats. The fact that he asked you to change back the seats shows that he was taking up a lot of her space, which she and you paid for. \n\nI understand flights are expensive and plus size people do need to fly. But they cannot expect that they will be able to take up part of the seat next to them any time they fly.", "NTA\n\nSo he was capable of staying in his own space the whole time and he only didn't when there was a petite woman next to him? He's a major AH. Airline seats are unreasonably small, but he needs to complain to the airline, buy an aisle seat, or purchase extra room because he should already know this. Being gross to the person next to you is unacceptable. \n\nInstead he chose to bully your wife. He fucked around and he found out.", "NTA.

What an ass, asking you to switch seats with your wife, because she is easier to squash for him than you. How dare he put his bulk on top of someone else in the seat that person paid for! You are right. If someone does not fit into one seat he should buy two, or ask for another seat next to an empty one. And is there is none, he should get on the next flight (or put on the next one by the crew). Under no circumstance you should tolerate someone who squashes you in the seat you paid for.", "NTA.\n\nHe has plenty of options that doesn't involve other people sacrificing for his comfort.", "NTA.

Yeah, airplane seats mostly suck, but that is no excuse to take up part of someone else's seat.", "NTA though to be fair, I read recently (when that overweight influencer was complaining about wanting a free seat, which\u2026 ugh) that airlines don\u2019t make it easy for people to buy two seats and even if they manage it, since flights are so often overbooked, those seats can still end up being taken by overflow passengers. \n\nBut of course this guy was a jerk about it. It\u2019s not your fault he\u2019s overweight nor should your GF be squeezed out of her seat.", "NTA. I feel for the guy, as the world isn't really built with wider people in mind, especially because transportation businesses are focused on cramming as many people into a plane as possible for more profit.

I kid you not, I've had at least 5 different occasions of obese men \"falling asleep\" on me, invading my space, breathing on me. I legit started to have panic attacks after the second time it happened, thankfully the Flight Attendants always understood and moved me without issue. And after that, I got proactive about it as soon as the first time my space was invaded, I'd ask to be moved. It was always granted. I was never rude but my seat mate certainly always knew why I was being moved and I think that's part of it. Maybe they really just didn't give a shit or they wanted me to move so the seat would be empty for them and they would be purposefully obnoxious. Idk. But I hate it. Nothing against fat people, but ffs buy two seats! And it's also the Airline's responsibility to enforce this.", "NTA\n\nYou did not antagonize this man.

Sitting next to morbidly obese people on planes sucks. Their ass covers 2 seats, charge them double if they want on.", "[deleted]", "NTA - he was using a space paid by you and then complained when his free ride ended. Too bad for him. However keep in mind that while most airlines allow for second seat purchase that is not true everywhere", "NTA He just wanted to be able to make your gf uncomfortable and take up her space.", "Tentatively NTA. I would say it depends on how you responded. As a (horizontally) bigger guy myself, I know it\u2019s uncomfortable on flights simply because the seats are pretty small. However, that doesn\u2019t entitle you to someone else\u2019s space. If you are truly too big for one seat, get two or accept that you won\u2019t be comfortable the whole time", "NTA\n\nI blame the airlines for this to an extent too for having made seats smaller and smaller even as people have gotten larger and larger over the years. The airlines need to do a better job about requiring that people above a certain weight actually buy two seats. They are well aware that they are squishing the people in the next seat when they don't and they simply don't care. We have stopped flying and just drive when we travel.

She didn't even fit entirely into the seat and could barely get the seatbelt closed.  I don't think I have ever witnessed anyone more uncomfortable for five hours.", "Exactly.

I was on the aisle seat and there were already two male passengers seated in the window and middle seats.
