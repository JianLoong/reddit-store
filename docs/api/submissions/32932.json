Not someone your cousin would be advised to stay involved with frankly whether you get this cleared up or not.\n\nBUT technically speaking a relationship with a 3rd cousin isn't incest, you share very little DNA with a 3rd cousin and plenty of people will have married their 3rd cousins without ever knowing it - after all, to be third cousins you only share 1 great-great grandparent, however, in your case since you were brought up as children together you have a much closer relationship which is why you feel so strongly, so although I agree she was way out of line and acting crazy, she wasn't accusing you of incest.", "Trailer Park Boys meme \"I'll pay you 20 quid to fuck off\"\n\nSmall price to pay, I know you definitely don't want to give that cretin any money but consider it an investment in your mental health so you don't have to hear about her anymore.", "Here's your 20, shove off hoser, you're NTA", "NTA, but pay up because if she\u2019s accusing y\u2019all of incest, imagine what she\u2019ll do if she doesn\u2019t get her money soon.", "Definitely NTA.
