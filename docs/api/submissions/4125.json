You'll probably seriously resent this in the future, as you are already starting to.\n\n\nYou and your fiancee deciding that you'll be the only one earning money has nothing to do with her sister.

The deal was $500 for every couple, $250 for a single person. If you wanted to approach your girlfriend about her paying her half of the trip so you're not paying for both of you, that's fine.
