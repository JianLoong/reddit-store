It seems like you should have declined (or offered your explanation for why it seemed unfair) earlier in the process. Here's the problem from my perspective...\n\n* Two of you are going, so just like all the *other* bills that you pay on behalf of both of you, this was one that was going to require that you pay for two people on one income. \n\n* You *either* think it is unfair to pay the full share because you are sleeping on the couches **OR** because you have a lower income/single salary. It sounds like the first issue was not raised in a timely manner, and it was only after your appeal based on income failed that you even suggested this should affect the amount you would pay.\n\nIf you were all going to a concert together, you'd have to pay for 2 tickets if the two of you wanted to attend. Your income does not come into play at all. Does your landlord adjust your rent because you only have one income? Does the electric company reduce your bill for that reason?

But that's where that ends.\n\n\nBut other than that...you agreed to a relationship with your fiancee where you are the sole earner. If you are barely breaking even, this sounds like a REALLY BAD idea. Especially when she's so young...what does this mean for the future. If she's out of the workforce at 22, she's not going to be a competitive candidate in the future. Do you plan on supporting both of you for the rest of your lives together?  You'll probably seriously resent this in the future, as you are already starting to.\n\n\nYou and your fiancee deciding that you'll be the only one earning money has nothing to do with her sister. You guys shouldn't her special treatment because they know your fiancee doesn't work. It shouldn't be other people's responsibility to cover her or pay more. If $500 is a struggle, you shouldn't have agreed to go on the trip. \n\n\nI thinknyou need to seriously talk to your fiancee about your financial future together.

It sucks that it inconveniences everyone else, but if you can't afford it you can't and that's unfortunately just how it goes. If your fiancee's sister/family were relying on everyone coming to keep costs at a certain rate, that's on them.\n\nI think, though, that whether or not it's fair for you to pay for both you and your fiancee isn't really relevant. The deal was $500 for every couple, $250 for a single person. If you wanted to approach your girlfriend about her paying her half of the trip so you're not paying for both of you, that's fine.

My fiancee seemed almost happy not to go originally but after I pointed it out to her sister directly, using the financial point, and her sister chewed my fiancee out, she has been very standoff-ish about the topic and quickly shuts down if it's brought up.
