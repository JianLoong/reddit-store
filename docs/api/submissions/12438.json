Even if you were a bit miffed at his timing, or felt it was not appropriate, is your housewarming party really so important to you that you'd hurt a close family member over it? Did you really feel the housewarming was RUINED because he chose that time to propose?

If your girlfriend didn't find it rude, you have no standing to intervene.", "NTA and if I could NTA this twice I would, since it\u2019s so sad that your gf is used to her family waltzing all over her and you stood up for her in a situation where she wouldn\u2019t have done so for herself.

He was too lazy to decorate/set up/plan his own get together. To top it off he didn't bother to check in beforehand with you-the hosts that did all the work to celebrate YOUR moment. If he had any brains he would have asked permission and helped sis with decorating, cleaning, costs, etc.", "YTA. It was a housewarming party, it\u2019s not that serious.

The atmosphere and environment were so lovely and nice that it would be a good place to propose.\n\nAnd like, it's a housewarming. Not a wedding, not a baby shower, not anything. Just a housewarming.\n\nYTA.", "ESH he shouldn't have hijacked the event but once he did you should have rolled with it. Nobody cares that much about a new house. I mean at the end of the day its an excuse to bring people together.

It is just plain rude to start hijacting events for your proposal. Oh my sister bought a new house? Perfect situation to make sure it revolves all around my proposal. Your BIL sounds like a cheapskate who thought he could get away with it. Is he normally so entitled?", "YTA, but more for timing sake. If you would have texted him later that night and said you thought it was BS stealing the spotlight from your GF, you would have probably not been the AH.

But AITA has revealed to me that apparently if you are at a social gathering that any and all other social events are taboo. So I guess you're NTA.", "He didn\u2019t stand up and do during your wedding speeches. It was a housewarming! Calm down. YTA.", "NTA. I agree with you. That guy lacks class. Don\u2019t listen to your gf\u2019s mother. I do feel badly for his gf. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA", "NTA but I\u2019m wondering what the family dynamic history is between your girlfriend and her brother/mother.  It\u2019s rude to propose at someone else\u2019s event without asking for permission but the mothers comment about \u201cliving in sin\u201d raised some questions for me about the behind the scenes drama of all this.  Good for you for setting boundaries on this kind attention stealing behavior but ask your girlfriend what this is really all about so you two can agree on appropriate boundaries for extended family in the future and be able to put up a more united front should anyone cross them going forward.", "NTA her brother should have asked your gf / his sister.", "ESH\n\nIt wouldnt have killed them to ask, but it was also just a house warming party.\n\nSounds hilarious though.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn't your party. You were way out of line. Stay in your lane.\n\nYou caused more of a scene than the proposal did. You should have let your gf handle it.", "Very light YTA. It was a rare (reluctant to assume once in a lifetime LOL) and special event that was already in motion, so your admonishment could have waited.", "YTA the irony of telling them to have some class is striking.", "NTA\n\nBased off your comments alone. Your gf says she's used to her family hijacking her events so clearly this is not a one time thing. \nIt seems her family uses every happy moment of hers to have the spot light shining on themselves.  I think all the Y T A comments are weird.", "[removed]", "ESH except your gf and her brother's gf\n\nHe was the asshole for choosing then to propose, yes, but you are also the asshole for how you chose to deal with the situation.\n\nPS; Your gf was lying to you, you weren't sweet and you ruined her party more than her brother did", "Lol if I\u2019m being honest I laughed a bit reading this. You\u2019re slightly TA for at least not giving his girlfriend the time to answer his proposal, but you\u2019re sweet for wanting your girlfriends housewarming to go smoothly. Did your girlfriend even know her brother was going to propose at her housewarming, what if she allowed it? How did she feel with your reaction?", "your girldfiend was fine with it  \n\n\nbut you also did upset someone trying to shove her religion down someone els's throat so i think you being TA there cancels that out. to make it more neutral since your girlfriend did think it sweet but un-needed.  \n\n\n  \nso NTA  \n\n\nas much as i want to but N a H i cannot do so with the religion enforcment agent that was there", "NTA as you mentioned that his family has a habit of doing this and the brother conveniently wants until gf isn\u2019t in the room. Sounds like gf\u2019s family is mad you didn\u2019t let them hijack yet another event.", "ESH. Your brother in law sucks for hijacking your girlfriends event, but you also suck for making the situation so awkward. Should have privately spoke to them afterwards explaining how inappropriate it was for them to pick their sisters event for their proposal rather than embarrassing them in front of everyone like that.", "NTA. You don't hijack another person's event for a proposal. Tell him to go out to dinner and do that with everyone else and to let your GF's party \\`be about her buying her first house.", "NTA. It wasn't their event and for him to do that was pretty shitty. He should've clued your sister in to see if she was cool with it first.", "NTA.\n\nDefinitely sounds to me like your GF appreciated you doing that.", "Exactly why are so people in desperate need of attention that when they see others having a nice moment in there life they have to hijack it", "Apparently hijacking other's celebrations is common in the gf's family and she was sad that it happened yet again. Sounds like her family are TA", "She did not. She was sad that he did it, but said she is used to her family hijacking her events and that it isn't a big deal to her anymore.", "Totally. This is absolute madness.", "To my thinking, the proposal (if accepted) only adds to the occasion and makes it more memorable. I don't understand why an occasion has to 'belong' to only one person. Ever hear of a joint birthday party? \n\nOf course, if the gf didn't like it, that's another story, but she didn't mind. It's not OP's place to decide something's not o.k. for his gf is she in fact is o.k. with it.", "She worked hard for that moment and how could anyone just steal it? Obviously the attention would shift to the couple rather than the house. The party was for HER and not them. They should've asked for permission beforehand.", "Excuse me! Are you seriously saying that OP took a key moment of there life and ruined it because he wouldn\u2019t let them take over his girlfriend key moment? She probably worked her arse off to be able to afford to buy a house and then ran around trying to find a date that could accommodate everyone she wanted to come, plus all the cooking and tidying she more than likely did all so she could share something she\u2019s proud of with her friends and family and the lazy brother decided do you know what it\u2019s not fair my sisters getting all the attention at her party at her house I\u2019m going to ask my girlfriend to marry me.", "Look up the full saying and meaning. I dare you.", "You really should look up that full saying, because it's actually the opposite of what you think it means.", "Blood is thicker them water is such an outdated statement. Water doesn't betray you like blood.", "That isn't even the whole statement. It's the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. Either way gf didn't like the fact that her brother tried it", "Judging by the fact the mother said she wanted her son to stop living in sin, I doubt that\u2019s a family you want to be accepted by.", "The girlfriend was conveniently not in the room when the proposal happened.", "OP said in a comment that gf was sad about it but is so used to her family hijacking her events that it doesn\u2019t bother her anymore.

Buying a house is a huge life milestone.", "I love it that some people are so lazy they can't even provide a venue for a proposal.  A proposal doesn't have to be spendy... but at least make it solely about your partner FFS.  That means a time, place, and proposal that is JUST for them.  No one else's party, event, gathering, decorations, idea, etc.  If you can't tailor one moment to ask this question to someone you love...", "Pretty much.
