That's such a bizarre moment to propose.", "NTA at all. Maybe you could have been a bit more polite, but it sounds like her family regularly does this based on your responses. I can't fathom thinking it's okay to propose at someone else's event/party in the slightest. At the very least, he should have asked your gf if it was okay first. He conveniently waited for her to be out of the room which to me seems similar to a kid getting into something they shouldn't when mom leaves the room (like some weird guilt). Good job sticking up for your gf! The brother is a delusional asshole who should have just planned his own thing. What woman wants their proposal to be at someone else's accomplishment party? It should be somewhere meaningful to their relationship, not your girlfriend's new house lmao.\n\nEdit to add: Brothers gf is most likely only embarrassed that her boyfriend thought it was a good idea to propose at your gf's housewarming party.", "NTA.

Anyone else find it weird the brother chose to purpose at the sister\u2019s house warming?", "NTA - Honestly, a housewarming party is kind of more significant than an engagement for a lot of people. It's actually harder to be able to afford to save for and buy a house on your own than it is to get engaged or married. All the people saying Y T A because it's just a housewarming don't get to decide what are important moments in people's lives. If the brother proposing made your girlfriend sad as you said it did, then it was inappropriate and I think it's good that you're able to validate your girlfriend so she can hopefully start setting some boundaries on your own. \n\nThe people suggesting you should have pulled him aside after, yea, no, that doesn't work with people who are used to walking all over others.

The bride as you imagine was not happy but decided not to intervene so as to not create a bigger scene. The bridesmaid was like: I've got this.

If she was busy / shocked and you wanted to say SOMETHING there was still options where you could have showed more class.

Don\u2019t stop sticking up for your girlfriend, you may not win over her family but you\u2019ll definitely win over her.", "I was going to say your response may have made the event worse for your girlfriend than just letting it go, but based on this information I\u2019m changing to NTA", "I think girlfriend was more upset that her brother did that at her party without permission or even a heads up stealing her spotlight and upset because her parents and brother finally got told no and probably taking it out on her too.", "You should had this to your post. Because a lot of AH are on your post.\nI hope your gf will learn that her and her accomplishments are important.", "I'd encourage you to add that a lot of her events get hijacked.    \n   \nWhen I initially read the post, I agree that what the brother did was classless but I thought that it was something you could have confronted him about later on. It makes a lot more sense why you confronted him at that moment if it's a pattern.", "Curious to know how they are \u201cliving in sin\u201d?", "Thats fair, cultural and personal factors change things.\n\nTheres no rule on what and isnt a major event, im just going by my own sense for it", "I literally just said he should\u2019ve asked and it was a dumb time to propose. Just bc I think OP was an ass doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think the person in question was an idiot.", "Even better!  \ud83d\ude01", "Welp. I hope it was worth it, and didn\u2019t put OP\u2019s girlfriend in an even more awkward situation than she was in before.", "Exactly!", "Shit a family like that doesn\u2019t need to be won over or even deserve it for that matter!", "GF still had her moment ruined even more, with not only the moment being stolen, but the party ending early and awkwardly.", "Exactly. The \u201cthat\u2019s sweet but you didn\u2019t have to do that\u201d is the kind of thing that is often said to people who behaved really OTT in a way that makes you uncomfortable. \n\nKnowing that her brother\u2019s behavior does bother her but that she\u2019s been trained to accept it is really important info.", "Yes, include that! That's a massive part of this.", "They have a baby, they live together and they aren't married.", "Premarital sex perhaps", "The fact that the gf put effort into throwing a party for the whole family suggests that it might be a big deal for her. I just cant imagine ever proposing at someone else\u2019s party. It screams of insecurity and trying to upstage your sibling", "You were the one going on about \u201cscarcity mindset.\u201d If you believe all that, why should the brother have asked at all? He\u2019s just multiplying joy, or whatever selfish assholes say when they want to leech off of others.", "Seems like OP and GF would be fine without the narcissistic family, family doesn't always have to be blood for reasons like this.", ">OTT\n\nwhat does this mean?  \n\n\nEdit: Over The Top", "He\u2019s had plenty of opportunities to propose in the past. NTA.", "NTA and good for you!  He deserved to be shamed and I bet they will think twice before railroading her again.", "I didn\u2019t know we were conducting a complex review of every individual\u2019s actions. But I\u2019ve already addressed your question. Idk what you\u2019re on about.", "Boy is *that* not OP\u2019s decision to make.", "I should have put a \"lol\" or something, I wasn't being completely serious. But I do like to advocate for cutting contact when needed. It's of course 100% her choice in the long run and it's hard to know the whole story, but I'm betting gfs brother is the golden child in the narcissistic family."]}
