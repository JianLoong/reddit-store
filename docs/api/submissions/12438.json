Kuddos to you for sticking up for her", "NTA\n\n\nI read some of your comments, baby brother is the golden child and gets away with everything.\nHis girlfriend was embarrassed,  so I'm wondering if she was thrilled that he was proposing to her there..  \n\nAlso, since your gf isn't mad, I'm definitely saying NTA for sticking up for her.", "NTA, it was her special event that bro wanted to make about them instead.", "NTA because I read your comment about her family always hijacking her events. Good for you for standing up for her.", "NTA. Be prepared to continue to offer this level of service to you gf because her family treats her like a doormat.", "Nta. That's such a bizarre moment to propose.", "NTA at all. Maybe you could have been a bit more polite, but it sounds like her family regularly does this based on your responses. I can't fathom thinking it's okay to propose at someone else's event/party in the slightest. At the very least, he should have asked your gf if it was okay first. He conveniently waited for her to be out of the room which to me seems similar to a kid getting into something they shouldn't when mom leaves the room (like some weird guilt). Good job sticking up for your gf! The brother is a delusional asshole who should have just planned his own thing. What woman wants their proposal to be at someone else's accomplishment party? It should be somewhere meaningful to their relationship, not your girlfriend's new house lmao.\n\nEdit to add: Brothers gf is most likely only embarrassed that her boyfriend thought it was a good idea to propose at your gf's housewarming party.", "NTA. Her brother is the AH, couldn\u2019t he propose at another time? Good on you for calling him out. I really hate people like him that like to hijack other people\u2019s special moments.", "NTA\u2026 her brother took advantage of a party he contributed nothing to. He wanted a special occasion to propose? Then plan one yourself. \nOr at least ask the host before and share expenses. \nI say good for you for sticking up for your girlfriend. Someone should! \nThis behavior is already to normalized in her life\u2026 (OP comments on her family high jacking events before) someone needs to put her first, and you did. \nThey\u2019re the type of people that would use someone else\u2019s babyshower to announce a pregnancy (without prior ok)", "Nta you wouldn\u2019t announce your pregnancy at someone\u2019s engagement party it\u2019s not about you let the other person have their moment and their event", "NTA \n\nWhy do a proposal at someone else event?\n\nBased on your comments they do this often as well taking the attention away from the host, GF.\n\nIt's just bleh", "NTA\n\nHis was poor behavior; you corrected it. \n\nPersonally, I hate that your GF is so used to her family hijacking her moments that she preferred that you not handle it on her behalf. Her mother should stop being an AH to her daughter and putting her son\u2019s \u201cliving in sin\u201d over her daughter\u2019s achievement.", "NTA, and maybe the memories of this will teach the family to not bulldoze the sister and her events anymore.", "Op is NTA ,Not when he\u2019s done this numerous times and didn\u2019t even ask his sister\u2026 let her do all the leg work pay and spend her money so I can cheap out on my engagement and be to lazy to plan it myself", "NTA. I cannot emphasize enough how much I despise public proposals. You essentially put the other person in a spot where it's more difficult to say no (should they  want to), and you hijack somebody else's event for your benefit. Get outta here with that shit. Good on you for standing up for yourself and your girlfriend and not falling for the social pressure to not say anything.", "NTA\n\nFrom seeing that her family has a history of doing this to her, you're good.", "NTA, I love how you handled the situation! Some people are saying you should\u2019ve let him finish but I like that you instantly shut it down and shamed him for it. I wish I could be that bold!", "NTA. Anyone else find it weird the brother chose to purpose at the sister\u2019s house warming?", "NTA - Honestly, a housewarming party is kind of more significant than an engagement for a lot of people. It's actually harder to be able to afford to save for and buy a house on your own than it is to get engaged or married. All the people saying Y T A because it's just a housewarming don't get to decide what are important moments in people's lives. If the brother proposing made your girlfriend sad as you said it did, then it was inappropriate and I think it's good that you're able to validate your girlfriend so she can hopefully start setting some boundaries on your own. \n\nThe people suggesting you should have pulled him aside after, yea, no, that doesn't work with people who are used to walking all over others. A slap on the wrist in private means nothing to people like that. Being called out and embarrassed in front of others is likely the only way to change that sort of behavior.", "Based on the additional info: NTA.", "NTA. What a Charley Fox that sounds like. Be mindful never to steal that woman's thunder. That is nothing anyone should get used to.", "NTA people don\u2019t get to commandeer other people\u2019s events.

This is what entitlement looks like.", "NTA.\n\nIf you're going to propose or make some kind of big announcement at someone else's party, you need to check with the host(s) beforehand.   Don't hijack someone else's event. \n\nThat said,  I'd say maybe next time pull them aside after the announcement instead of calling them out publicly.   As you said yourself,  it ruined the party.", "Nope, Not the Ass. this guy was out of line.  This was his sisters moment and he had to take that away from her, he is the Ass.  Good for you on doing that.", "NTA based on your comment that his family has a history of hijacking her events.\nI think the way you did it was a little harsh though. \n\nWrite the brother back pointing how cheep he is that he can't even set an special event for his gf and needs to cling on other people's parties like a leech.", "NTA. \nThis was a planned event for *your girlfriend* to show off all her hard work and you were being supportive. This event wasn\u2019t a good place to propose to since the event wasn\u2019t centered on it nor planned out beforehand. You did wonderful sticking up for her and i wish you two the best. The brother and mother are both ah in this", "NTA love that u stuck up for ur gf. It was weird that the brother decided to do it during the party", "NTA.  The party wasn't a big party; but it still wasn't their event.  The fact that you'd want to propose at someone elses house without giving a heads up to the homeowners is pretty disrespectful.  Asking isn't that hard.", "NTA and frankly GF's brother should be embarrased about proposing to his girl at a housewarming party. I proposed to my wife on the slopes of Kilauea at dawn after seeing the lava glow at night.  Proposing at his sisters housewarming with no planning is low effort and tacky.", "NTA - No matter how small the event may be, unless the brother cleared it with your girlfriend, he should have kept his mouth shut.  He was rude for not asking, rude for using someone else's party, hard work, and money as a free venue, and he was rude to his own girlfriend for not even putting forth the effort of a decent proposal.\n\nThe mom sucks too and anyone else who thinks it's okay to continuously steal your girlfriend's events.", "NTA. He should plan his own party to propose to his girlfriend, not hijack the party his sister paid for and worked hard on. It was her moment to celebrate her new house.", "You Sir are a Goddamn Hero!! You are not the asshole you are a fucking king!!", "NTA. You said your Gf is used to her family hijacking her events. Also stated, she didnt know about the proposal. AND they purposely waited for Gf to be away to do, because they knew she wouldnt be happy. \n\nMom is only mad because, \"Why cant Gf just let us steam roll her as usual? Her dang husband got in the way.\" \n\nPeople like them, know exactly what they are doing. Usually, its even planned out. They specifically wait to take advantage of someones else footing the bill for the party. Only to steal the free spotlight. And then not have to clean up afterwards. \n\nUgh, its like people who join someone elses celebration dinner. Graduation, promotions, etc. Only to sit down and try to talk about THEIR most recent success. They know exactly what they're doing. \n\nGood for you for standing up for her Op. Maybe after some time Gf will realize she deserves to have the spotlight at her own housewarming party.", "NTA", "NTA that\u2019s a chad move right there, keep being your girl\u2019s advocate", "NTA. But maybe I would have waited until after the event to tell him off. Not for him or his mum (she sounds delightful btw) but because it wasn't his girlfriend's fault either.", "Nope. NTA. Unless the brother had cleared this with his sister (which it seems he didn\u2019t) he\u2019s just plain rude and her family sucks! Keep supporting your girl, sounds like she appreciates you!", "NTA what a weird and completely inappropriate place for the brother to propose. He could have proposed at any other time in any other place and he chose his sister\u2019s housewarming party?", "NTA", "NTA dude was trying to make your girlfriend\u2019s event all about him.  If I was the guy\u2019s girlfriend I would have been so embarrassed, there\u2019s a time and place for a proposal and this was not it.", "NTA\n\nTaking advantage of an event that someone else put together, organized, and catered to make yourself the center of attention is beyond rude. \n\nYou're right OP, classless move.", "The AH here is the brother, he should have talked to you or your gf first, but according to your comments, that\u2019s not their style to care about not trampling other people.\n\nYou did it a bit rougher than needed, but it was still necessary", "NTA. I dont care if it was a backyard BBQ put on by your neighbors, unless he had specific permission to hijack his sisters party he had no right to do so and good for you for standing up to her family. She may say she's used to the bulldozing but that doesn't make it right. It sounds like they are all AHs.", "NTA. You should never propose at someone else\u2019s event without their permission. It\u2019s not hard to say \u201chey, we\u2019re all going to be gathered together for this event, and I\u2019d love to surprise my partner and propose with the whole family. Is that cool?\u201d \n\nAnd for all the people saying it\u2019s just a housewarming, buying a house especially in this market is absolutely an accomplishment and worth celebrating. Some\nPeople work their asses off for years to accomplish that. It may not seem like a big deal but it is. Have your moment another time.", "NTA but it probably would've been better to wait until afterwards and talk to her brother out of the spotlight and tell him how rude it was.", "NTA. Well, we know who the golden child is. This was your girlfriend's housewarming party, not an opportunity for her brother to propose. Do NOT back down, apologize, or anything like that. Don't tolerate any excuses along the lines of *'but there were so many members of our family there'*. That doesn't matter, and neither does the mother's piss poor reasoning of wanting her son to stop living in sin. There would have been other opportunities for him to propose. I hope the girlfriend was embarrassed on your behalf, because that sounds downright humiliating.", "NTA. You did the right thing calling out her family\u2019s BS. Sounds like the son is the golden child. The parents should have been more supportive of their daughter. Supporting the son is basically saying \u201cwe don\u2019t care about what our daughter does, it\u2019s what her brother does that is more important\u201d You are a keeper OP. Stick to your boundaries!", "NTA, i feel sorry for the brothers GF, only because she got proposed to at a house her future sil has bought. Thats cringe. I would much rather something more private and personal than a housewarming party.", "NTA\n\nProposing at your sister's party without telling her and waiting until she wasn't even in the room to propose is a colossal dick move. If he wanted to propose so bad, he should've thrown his own party.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s hilarious that you shut that down in the act. Most people would not be that brave.  It\u2019s nice of you to know that it\u2019s rude and defend your gf.", "NTA\n\nIf your brother had asked you first, I'd feel differently. But he was being an AH doing this at your girlfriend's housewarming. Without asking either you or your girlfriend for permission beforehand.\n\nIt's basically overshadowing all the hard work she did. And it's being a bad guest.\n\nI'd also think her entire family are AH's if they're ok with her being overshadowed so completely.", "lowkey I\u2019d be pissed if my eventual brother-in-law proposed at specifically my event with no warning", "NTA", "NTA. I can\u2019t stand people who hijack others\u2019 events like this. Good for you for not letting your girlfriend\u2019s brother steal her moment.", "NTA, he took a major life event of your GF and tried to turn into a celebration of him and his relationship. Piggybacking on your event reeks of laziness. His girlfriend deserved a more thoughtful proposal than that.", "NTA. Her brother hijacked her event and made it all about him.", "NTA because that brother is the prick, I'm of the opinion that public proposals are almost always a bad idea. It's about those two people and no one else. Stealing the show at celebration of something else is just poor form, even if your gf was on board ahead of time the guests didn't come for it.\n\n\nMom is also an AH too\n\nYou were my very favorite kind of asshole. Sometimes the situation calls you to be an ah, and you rose to the occasion brilliantly.\n\nAnd for that I grant you a pardon.", "NTA. I might have said that everyone's TA if this had been the first time her family members had ever done this. If that had been the case, the brother should have known better, and you might have been better off with a quiet word.\n\nBut your comments below said they've done this to every event your girlfriend has thrown?\n\nSo every time she's put time, money, and thought into celebrating something she's accomplished, her family members just take it over?\n\nThat's ugly as hell and just as tacky.", "NTA. Your girlfriend had no idea and according to you her family has a habit of this. She said it was sweet of you. Her brother can make his own arrangements to propose.", "Notice: he waited for his sister to leave the room. That\u2019s pretty telling that even he knew he was being the soggy pop tart here. NTA\n\nWhy is there so much allowance given to this kind of behavior? If you want to propose with your whole family around, maybe throw your own party that you can personalize so you get the attention you so crave. Or at least \u201cokay\u201d it with the host first before you use their setup as a freebie engagement party.", "NTA.

Read your comments, sounds like your girlfriend's family is just mad that she has someone to stick up for her now.  Good on you!", "NTA", "NTA. Great boyfriend", "I'm a bit torn, because on one side, this was probably a huge family gathering, but on the other hand it was your GF's night, not his. \n\nUltimately, you're NTA here...her brother should have planned his own night or at least asked his sister/your gf for permission to do it.", "NTA but mainly because it\u2019s what your gf seemed to have wanted.", "NTA. Your girlfriend said it was sweet and ultimately that was her party so whatever she says is correct.", "NTA. I am not getting all these YTAs. It feels corny to propose at someone else\u2019s big event. The brother had to make it about himself.", "NTAH- it wasn\u2019t her mothers call to make - IF it had been arranged ahead of time with your GF permission- it would be a different story- it was a bad judgement call of the brother and the mother to ASSUME it was okay to steal the focus and limelight from your GF accomplishments and try to redirect it onto themselves and the engaged couple. \nI somehow suspect his gf is kind of used to that though from her family- given her reaction. \nI applaud you for standing up for her and her event/accomplishments ! Good job!", "NTA athough you could have been more diplomatic.\n\nIt's bordering on bizarre to propose in public at someone else's party.", "NTA", "NTA.  He should have known that was NOT the time to do that. I LOVE how you squashed it and ruined it for them. I think it was brilliant.  IT WAS RIGHTFULLY DESERVED. He'll have to propose another time.

WTF.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI dont think it's wrong for your gf (or you on her behalf) to be peeved at what her brother did as it's rude and tacky to use someone else's event for your own moment.\n\nI would say it may have been better to address the issue privately after the fact, however I see your comments show that her family has a habit of doing things like this so it was probably called for.", "NTA it's common courtesy to ask for permission to do something as big as a proposal at SOMEONE ELSE'S home! Completely NTA here OP. The family tho is the Ahole.", "NTA. Public proposals always feel a tad manipulative unless discussed beforehand, I'd imagine he wouldn't have spoken to his gf and said \"Hey I'm going to propose at my sis' housewarming\".

Your girlfriend needs to have more self respect and not just tolerate this crap from her family.  It sounds like her younger brother is the golden child and can do no wrong.\n\nI'm glad you stopped him and he was embarrassed.  Maybe this is the beginning of the end of them hijacking her events.  Just imagine what he'll try to pull if you two get married.... announce she's pregnant at your wedding?

So you might be the AH for that. I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not religious.", "NTA. Glad you stood up to your girlfriend's hard efforts for her event. Her brother is the AH for hijacking her event without asking your opinion first. He ruined his proposal all by himself.", "NTA - WTF who does your gf's brother think he is? Who proposes at SOMEONE ELSE'S EVENT?\n\nI'm sure his gf was mortified - I'd certainly have been too!", "OP please make an edit to include a summary of the backstory you put in the comments. It provides key info that I think would sway voters to say NTA", "NTA.\n\nWhoever says it was not your place is wrong. It's your duty to be on your SO side. And whomever said you destroyed this experience for the girl didn't take into account that as soon she would start to tell people how he proposed she would realize how opportunistic and cheap he exactly is.\n\nFor future reference I read a story here 2 weeks ago about someone disrupting a wedding reception with proposal. The bride as you imagine was not happy but decided not to intervene so as to not create a bigger scene. The bridesmaid was like: I've got this. She went up to a couple congratulated them and asked to see the ring. She took a good look and than destroyed them with one sentence: well at least he didn't cheap out on a ring. The shade was strong enough to chase them out in less than 20 minutes.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA - but your gf needs to get a spine", "I think your not an asshole.

Hopefully your girlfriend can learn that it\u2019s ok to stand up for herself.", "I'm gonna go with NTA because it sounds like OP's girlfriend was happy that he did something. I would've said E-S-H if she was upset or didn't think he should've interrupted but she thought it was sweet.

If he proposed and she said yes it would be an event everyone remembered for multiple reasons.

You taught him a lesson but at what cost?", "Living in SIN !!!! LMAO !!!\nTbh I would've said you're an ah but just your mil reply made me forget everything else !! How do you live in sin just because you're not married ?

Was not his moment to try making it his moment. But neither was it your place to pull this off.

I\u2019m not the one that piggy backed onto a party that was organized, catered and planned by someone else in an attempt to get out of having to do that for my own event. I\u2019m not the one that tried to make a life changing proposal at someone else\u2019s life changing moment to get out of doing the hard work. That was you! And just so you know, no woman wants to have their proposal at someone else\u2019s party. Ever. They want it to be special and to be catered to who she is as a woman. If all you had to do was plop down on a knee and give her a ring, you don\u2019t care enough about her to make something special happen for her.

It sucks that this seems to be a pattern with her family, and her brother A. Shouldn't have upstaged her and B.
