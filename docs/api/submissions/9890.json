During this time, we didn't have huge issues. We fought, we talked things out. I thought we both were on the same page about religion. He said he was not super religious, though he does attend church. He never forced me to go, but I would attend for holidays (with his family.) \n\nI met his niece (19F) Mercy several times. She is awesome. She sings, she plays several instruments, she makes music videos with her friends. She talked about wanting to go to college to study music theory (not sure the official title of the program.) Her parents encouraged her to be a teacher and said she should sing in the church. \n\nI found out that the family had no intention of letting her go to a secular college, because they think girls should get married. There was a huge argument when Mercy was accepted to \\[Secular University\\] on an almost full ride. They wanted her to go to a Christian University like Bob Jones. \n\nShe ended up moving in with her boyfriend and took all her stuff with her. Her boyfriend ended up not being able to house her for long and she begged me to let her house her instruments at my house. I agreed. She said she had plans to couch surf until college started and then hopefully she could get aid to pay for the dorm. \n\nI live about an hour away from the university she wants to attend. I said she should stay with me. It might be a bit of a drive, but I could cover the cost of her food and shelter. I thought Christian would be overjoyed, but it led to him screaming at me about \"turning her away from God\" and this was to make her understand she was wrong. \n\nI broke up with him and still have Mercy living with me. She has been here about three months. She has been a stellar roommate for the most part. We have had discussions about guests being over at late hours, since I work from home. We also have a plan in place for her to save the money to eventually move out. But she is free to stay until graduation unless something terrible happens. I don't see that being an issue though.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676315704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111hb8e/aita_for_taking_in_my_ex_boyfriends_niece/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mercy is allowed to live the life she chooses; her family's religious views have absolutely no bearing on her life if she doesn't want it to, and that includes your ex. All you're doing is supporting her making her own choices, rather than throwing her to her family that would try to force her to abandon those goals she has. You're doing a very good thing.", "NTA. You helped her escape! Not all heroes wear capes! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "Definitely NTA!\n\nYou are trying to do what is best for Mercy, and allowing her to pursue her dreams of a secular education. You are also providing her with a safe place to stay and helping her to save money for her future. You are being a great friend and mentor to her, and Christian should be thankful for that.", "NTA. Sounds like you dodged a bullet tossing this guy out, plus you\u2019re helping someone out who was living with an unhealthy family dynamic. Big wins all around", "NTA. You saved this young lady from an unfulfilling life, and you got rid of the bf who, once he had you locked down, would have most likely tried to push you to follow his beliefs. Win-win!", "Absolutely NTA. I know people who have gone to Bob Jones and similar \u201ccolleges\u201d they are hell holes that will et your niece nowhere. You are saving this girl\u2019s life. Good call breaking up with Christian if he thinks treating a young woman this way is okay.\n\nBless you.", "NTA, and given the reaction that your now ex boyfriend had, it\u2019s good you got yourself away from that family as well.", "NTA.  Like, WTF.  You helped her upgrade from Bob Jones, and he breaks up with you?", "You are doing a generous thing for someone who needs and appreciates your help. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA. I grew up related to and going to church with \"Good Christians\" like your ex. No one more toxic and insufferable. 2 years is a long time to have your head buried in the sand. Hopefully some good will come of it though if his sister is going to stay with you.", "Your house, you can host whomever you want.\n\nGood job saving her from the cult school.", "NTA, and I think you know it. You don\u2019t need validation from Reddit; this guy is clearly brainwashed from his upbringing, which was sure to cause some issue in the future, even if this wasn\u2019t the breaking point. Just move on knowing you made the best possible decision.", "NTA, and thank who or whatever that she has you in her life.", "NTA. Good for Mercy, and good deliverance for you.", "NTA. She has the right to live her life how she wants to. Your bf and his family cannot force her to go to a college she doesn't want to attend. You are helping her in more ways than you realize. She's learning that she can be a independent and free to make her own choices while living with you.", "NTA support her going for her dream.", "NTA. You are doing a good thing for her. You are kind.", "NTA! Thank you for helping that girl get out of her situation. Also it\u2019s a little weird that her uncle is more upset about her living with you than when she was \u201cliving in sin\u201d with her boyfriend!", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Mercy is an adult. She can make her own choices and seems to be hitting them out of the ballpark so far, including in her choice of friend. You're awesome for helping her through his transition, and for helping her pursue her ambitions. Good luck to you both!", "NTA\n\nYou're a good person.  And as traumatic as this had to be for Mercy, I'm glad you got to see your Ex for who he was before you got further into the relationship.", "Don't take this in a wrong way, but what is wrong with you? Do you seriously ask if you're an AH for helping a child (yes, i know she is 18, but to me that is a child still) whose family abandoned her? How can you be the bad guy for offering her a chance at making her dreams come true? NTA", "NTA.  YOU ARE A HERO!  Those religious colleges with questionable accreditations give me the creeps, as do any religions that try to keep women down.  Mercy will be getting a legitimate education that she will then be able to use to actually support herself when she graduates, unlike a worthless diploma .\n\nAs for your relationship with Christian, bullet dodged, my friend.", "NTA. Lucky you're in the picture. Kids grow up life goes on. Not right the family thinks they get to plan her future.", "There are churches around secular colleges.
