During this time, we didn't have huge issues. We fought, we talked things out. I thought we both were on the same page about religion. He said he was not super religious, though he does attend church. He never forced me to go, but I would attend for holidays (with his family.) \n\nI met his niece (19F) Mercy several times. She is awesome. She sings, she plays several instruments, she makes music videos with her friends. She talked about wanting to go to college to study music theory (not sure the official title of the program.) Her parents encouraged her to be a teacher and said she should sing in the church. \n\nI found out that the family had no intention of letting her go to a secular college, because they think girls should get married. There was a huge argument when Mercy was accepted to \\[Secular University\\] on an almost full ride. They wanted her to go to a Christian University like Bob Jones. \n\nShe ended up moving in with her boyfriend and took all her stuff with her. Her boyfriend ended up not being able to house her for long and she begged me to let her house her instruments at my house. I agreed. She said she had plans to couch surf until college started and then hopefully she could get aid to pay for the dorm. \n\nI live about an hour away from the university she wants to attend. I said she should stay with me. It might be a bit of a drive, but I could cover the cost of her food and shelter. I thought Christian would be overjoyed, but it led to him screaming at me about \"turning her away from God\" and this was to make her understand she was wrong. \n\nI broke up with him and still have Mercy living with me. She has been here about three months. She has been a stellar roommate for the most part. We have had discussions about guests being over at late hours, since I work from home. We also have a plan in place for her to save the money to eventually move out. But she is free to stay until graduation unless something terrible happens. I don't see that being an issue though.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676315704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111hb8e/aita_for_taking_in_my_ex_boyfriends_niece/", "score": 292, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mercy is allowed to live the life she chooses; her family's religious views have absolutely no bearing on her life if she doesn't want it to, and that includes your ex.

Sounds like you dodged a bullet tossing this guy out, plus you\u2019re helping someone out who was living with an unhealthy family dynamic. Big wins all around", "NTA. You saved this young lady from an unfulfilling life, and you got rid of the bf who, once he had you locked down, would have most likely tried to push you to follow his beliefs. Win-win!", "Absolutely NTA. I know people who have gone to Bob Jones and similar \u201ccolleges\u201d they are hell holes that will et your niece nowhere. You are saving this girl\u2019s life.

Like, WTF.  You helped her upgrade from Bob Jones, and he breaks up with you?", "You are doing a generous thing for someone who needs and appreciates your help. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA.

She has the right to live her life how she wants to. Your bf and his family cannot force her to go to a college she doesn't want to attend. You are helping her in more ways than you realize.

Would there be better marriage candidates at Bob Jones U? Why send her to college at all- I'm sure they know plenty of 'available' men who would like to control- I mean marry her.\n\nThe problem with going to universities like Bob Jones U is that you have to adhere ( or give the appearance of) sticking to certain rules that may or may not be helpful to your growth as a whole person, not just a Christian. They have the same problems as secular universities but things are swept under the rug. There is almost no support if you are a victim of sexual abuse on campus- wouldn't want to 'taint' the schools reputation, you know.\n\nIt is possible to go to a secular school and maintain your faith- I did. If her faith is so weak that it can't withstand questioning and exposure to other ideas, well it wasn't really hers to begin with. The time has come for her to examine her faith and make it her own.\n\nYou did a good thing. It also helped you see that whatever he said was a lie.

As a 19 year old woman, Mercy is capable of making her own decisions and they should all be so proud that she wants to get an education with a scholarship to pay for it all.

Glad you escaped the ex-bf!", "NTA, You are doing the right thing", "Looks like one of those situations where the boyfriend or girlfriend from an uber religious upbringing gets independent but after marriage returns to the fold.  If you think about it, returning to a conservative religious life after marriage advantages men totally.  Being less religious while dingle allows for a wider field of choice if the guy figures a girlfriend will become submissive in exchange for marriage.  \n\nYour helping Mercy in the way you did demonstrated you weren\u2019t likely to fall in line.", "Your ex-bf doesn't get a say in who lives in your house.
