I waited a few days before going next door and ran into her brother who said that she wasn't on vacation, but actually *moved* back to their home county. I tried to contact her, but she ignored me. At first it was because she had only paid me to watch her dog for 2 weeks, but after a month passed I was genuinely confused and concerned. I DM'd her on social, and even though she was actively posting, she never responded. I didn't feel like her life was in danger though since her posts seemed to be updating in real time of her doing fun things. \n\nI ended up having to take Sally's dog to the vet for a check up (he ended up being fine) and while there, the vet actually let me know that the dog wasn't microchipped. It had already been several months at this point, so I decided to claim ownership. \n\nLo and behold, Sally appears on my doorstep and wants her dog back. At that point, I said no.
