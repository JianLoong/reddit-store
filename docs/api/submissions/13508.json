A sweet neighbor girl (elementary age) who came to play with my dog a couple times a week, came and told me that she and her family were moving. We were closer than you describe, but there were sometimes communication problems because  I speak English and the family speaks Spanish. The girl, let's call her April, asked me if I would watch her new dog for the weekend. They dog was also a stray and was not taken care of. After some discussion with the family, I agreed to watch the dog over the weekend. \n\nThis is almost two years ago. I've never heard back despite living in the same small town, trying to connect with four family members, etc. \n\nI did what I perceived as my due diligence, kept the dog for about a month, hoping it was a communication problem, but never heard back. I went to the humane society to see if he was chipped, and did some posting on social media since \"April\" only had him for a couple days before leaving him with me. Nothing. \n\nI could not take an another dog at the time. He was sweet and only about 5 pounds a Maltese mixed breed. He was also clearly sick and in need of some Veterinary care. My mom was looking for a dog at the time, so after about 6 weeks I messaged her to explain that I can keep the dog but he is the sweetest, and I would meet her half way between our homes in different states if she wanted him....and she did! We met that  weekend and he has been with my mom and dad since. \n\nI felt terrible and prayed that April would not come asking for him because it would have broke her heart. She never did. \n\nMy mom and dad nursed the little guy back to health and they are so happy. \n\nAnyway, this is a very long post to say, these things happen. I have no anger toward April's family, because life happens, but I didn't have the ability to look after him long term. If my mom wouldn't have wanted him, I would have looked for a good home among other friends or taken him to the local animal shelter for rehoming. \n\nYou are NTA. Hopefully they won't do this again.", "NTA.  I'd be interested to hear his idea on abandoned property, as an animal is considered such.

She never even got it chipped or took it to a vet. She moved countries, she has no rights.\n\nI say this as a dog owner who would never do this. F her.", "She never answered you or asked how the dog was doing? If so, NTA. If I let one of my friends watch my dog, I would want pictures of him everyday.", "I have 4 cats and would be devastated to not have them for a day let alone months NTA the dog is yours and not hers", "NTA, re-home the BF too if he thinks its okay to abandon your dog for months and not pay the dog sitter for months.", "NTA - she gave up any rights when she abandoned YOUR dog      \nMy nieces did the same thing with their kittens.      \nThey were between houses and I was supposed to have the kittens for 2 weeks.        \nThey had them for about 1 month.       \nOver a year later one called and told me she was coming to get \u2018her\u2019 cat (the other one said it\u2019s been too long and she\u2019s mine)         \nI said no, she\u2019s mine, she sleeps with me at night, plays or sleeps with my cats during the day.       \nShe got upset, I told her if she wants to pay me having for getting her de-sexed, her vaccinations, her worming and flea treatment and her food (the good expensive stuff) she can come and get her.      \nShe called her cousins to complain.      \nMy nephew is sweet and said nicely \u2018maybe it\u2019s better she stays where she is, she\u2019s used to it now\u2019.  \nMy niece who can be really sweet but doesn\u2019t hold back when truth is needed said \u2018I wouldn\u2019t give her back to you either\u2019 \ud83d\ude02.   \nShe stopped asking.", "you're def in the right \u02db NTA bec\u272euse how do you expect someone to just care for your pet for months", "Agreed!!", "Honestly, I\u2019m this case I\u2019d recommend abandoning bf.", "Don't give the neighbor ideas. OP would probably win but some areas have very specific steps to follow before adopting a lost/abandoned animal.", "NTA. She abandoned her dog and you picked up the slack. Plain and simple. You obviously love the dog or you would\u2019ve made an effort to re home them.", "NTA. You saved that dog. Sally clearly doesn't know how to take care of a dog and doesn't seem to care enough to do some research.\n\nI can never understand how someone is able to just abandon their pet. Years ago, my grandparents had a tenant who went back to her home country. Grandparents went to check the apartment to see if everything was ok and if it needed any fixing before getting new tenants. They went in and found the ex tenant's dog. I don't know if they managed to contact the woman but it didn't matter. She was gone and the dog was abandoned. Thankfully my aunt was happy to take the dog.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t you dare give that dog back to her, you know what will happen.  She will just abandon it again as soon as it becomes inconvenient to her.", "NTA and please please don\u2019t give the dog back!!! It was only with her a few weeks and has been with you and your dog for MONTHS. It has bonded with you and your family. The dog is better off with you now. \n\nNot to mention that she has shown she isn\u2019t a responsible dog owner - not getting it to a vet and abandoning it with someone with no warning. Really think about that - plenty of strays are stray because someone has dumped them. How did she know her neighbor she left this dog with and ghosted wouldn\u2019t do that? She isn\u2019t taking the dog\u2019s care seriously.", "NTA. She abandoned that dog. Drop your BF. He clearly is deficient.", "You\u2019re nicer than me. \n\nLove the dog. Leave the bf. Smack Sally.", "NTA. Your neighbor is a poor dog owner and I would be hesitant to return the animal to someone who just disappeared on it for months without any concern or question regarding its well-being. Just Hell no! Your BF is high with his \"technically\" bullshit. If we want to get technical, let's talk about how \"technically\" she abandoned the dog. \n\nI don't think you should lose any sleep over this. Keep being awesome and spoil those babies!", "NTA, you obviously care more for the dog than her.", "Nta she abandoned the dog after two weeks that\u2019s all she provided for his care \nIn 2020 the average price for boarding a dog was$500 a month so that\u2019s what she owes you per month plus vet fees but I personally wouldn\u2019t give her the dog back in most countries (I\u2019m not us) you have 7-14 days to claim your dog or it\u2019s put up for adoption", "I mean if the vet says OP is in the clear, OP probably is. Vets are usually very knowledgeable about the procedure with lost/abandoned animals ."]}
