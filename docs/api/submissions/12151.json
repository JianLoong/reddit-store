I\u2019m getting married later this year to my amazing fianc\u00e9. When choosing the bridal party, i was a bit conflicted about who should be my maid of honor. I have one sister who i love dearly, but she is significantly younger than me. I thought the maid of honor responsibilities might be overwhelming for her because she has not been to many weddings yet and only and handful of her friends have gotten married. I thought my best friend may be the better maid of honor choice because she\u2019s been a bridesmaid several times and she has a knack for planning and keeping people in check. I talked about my feelings of conflict with my mom, who made it abundantly clear she felt my sister was the only choice for maid of honor. My mom even said she would help her with planning since I was worried about it. I made several chats with the bridal party and both moms so everyone had each others contact info and told my sister to reach out to the bridesmaids to help plan things if she was feeling overwhelmed. \n\nMonths have now gone by, and I recently got a call from my best friend letting me know she\u2019s a little worried about how things are going. Apparently my sister didn\u2019t realize that the maid of honor is responsible for planning the bachelorette, shower, and essentially being my point person on the day of the wedding. It\u2019s gotten to the point where trying to talk to my sister about the wedding stuff she should be working on hurts my feelings because \u201cI\u2019m too hard to please\u201d or \u201cwon\u2019t be happy no matter what.\u201d I don\u2019t want to hurt my sister\u2019s feelings by demoting her to bridesmaid, so I talked to my mom about what\u2019s been going on to see if she could maybe step in and help my sister out. Rather than seeing how much additional stress this is causing me, my mom agreed with my sister\u2019s general sentiment which is that I\u2019m difficult to please and change my mind too much. My mom also told me she didn\u2019t feel like it was fair for me to expect so much of my sister. I reminded her that this is what you sign up for when you agree to be someone\u2019s maid of honor, and my mom told me that \u201cmaid of honor\u201d is just a title and that it\u2019s ultimately my wedding to plan.

The bridesmaids who were in town took care of planning most of the shower, although I made suggestions/contributed to the ideas. The day of the wedding, I made sure I had a bag with safety pins, hairpins, bandaids, double-sided tape, etc., and that bag went with us to the church, for photos, and to the reception.

Your maid of honor isn't a paid employee so it's unfair she handle certain responsibilities based on a title.", "Yta i don\u2019t get this American thing where bridesmaid/maid of honour is like some way to hoist huge amounts of responsibilities and costs on people.

What you're expecting from your sister/maid of honor should be the responsibility of you or your wedding planner. Why didn't you talk with your sister about the responsibilities you expected from her before asking her to be your maid of honor? Personally, I would never expect these responsibilities if asked to be maid of honor. It's just the \"head bridesmaid\" title and maybe a little extra help if asked. Sometimes the maid of honor brings silly stuff to the bachelorette party, but it's not automatically their responsibility to plan it if they take the title.", "YTA.

One functional, one honorary. That's what my best friend did. I was living abroad when she got married. I couldn't DO much of anything but she still wanted me to have that title. But she also didn't want the person who did all the work to feel slighted. So she had two. In the end, I wasn't even at the wedding and attended virtually (her call, made later on once she wheedled out of me how much it'd cost to travel back) but I was still listed as MaO on things and her other MaO did the planning.

She would have made a lovely bridesmaid and likely would have appreciated it.  \n2) Did you give your sister any idea before she said yes to MOH of the responsibilities you expected of her and what level of detail or type of 'party' you expected her to put together?  \n3) At this point, you should be asking yourself what you really want; activities planned by your sister that your sister is capable of hosting, or the 'perfect plan you had in your head'.

I don\u2019t even want to have a shower but the moms are insisting so I didn\u2019t think it was unreasonable to ask her to help them plan that.", "Why does she have to help the Moms let the Moms plan it . Like why does she need to help?", "If you don\u2019t want a shower, why are you offended your sister didn\u2019t know she was expected to plan it? And it sounds like she is planning the bachelorette with your friend, so what\u2019s the problem? Gonna have to say YTA here.", "Exactly.  Moms or aunts or whomever are great for planning showers. They usually have the money and the bigger homes and serving platters and access to folding chairs and all that stuff.  \n\nMost weddings I've been involved with its the older generation who throw the shower.  \n\nI wonder if OP wants a very elaborate shower?", "She doesn\u2019t HAVE to do anything. I just thought it would be a fun bonding thing for her and my mom to do together with my fianc\u00e9s mom because they\u2019re happy for me?", "I\u2019m not offended about the stupid shower. I\u2019m offended that I went over expectations of the MOH helping out beforehand and now that the wedding is coming up and I need help MOH is only a title.", "She sounds like a peach./s", "Being a MOH isn\u2019t fun. You\u2019re expecting a lot from one person. And your thought of what is fun is different than what someone else thinks is fun.", "But also our moms wouldn\u2019t know half of our friends if they tripped over them so having someone who actually knows who everyone is is pretty helpful", "Except she\u2019s planning the bachelorette party, so how is it just a title\u2026?", "It really is only a title and a ceremonial role. Party planner is a profession.  One people get hired to do and paid to do.  And you get to boss them around.  \n\nI do not know why you think a maid of honor is a wedding coordinator and must plan a shower and Bachelorette party.  It's nice if someone does these things if you want them.  It's not important who does it.  \n\nYou say you don't want a shower but people are planning you a shower. But you are calling your little sister an asshole because she isn't planning the shower that you think is stupid? \n\nFrankly this makes no sense.  \n\nIf you think a shower is stupid don't have one.  \n\nAnd you should not have told them to plan one.  \n\nIf you want a shower and you have people planning you a shower then you don't have a problem.", "You are making this so complicated.  \n\nLet the moms plan the shower. People plan showers all the time when they don't know the guests.  If sister wants to help she will.  If she doesn't she doesn't have to. \n\nAnd don't force other people to bond with other people.  They will or they won't.  Orchastrating the social lives of adults is weird.", "You\u2019re right how dare I. Wedding planing is so simple and straightforward. I bet you have loads of experience planning weddings. And yes definitely so weird of me to orchestrate my sister and mom hanging out.", "You cannot possibly think you\u2019re the only person in this thread who has planned a wedding before.", "Take a deep breath.   \n\nYour snarky response is silly. You actively came to this board for feedback. I provided feedback. That's how all this works. Acting aghast at my response is silly and trying to use sarcasm to cut me down is uncalled for. No need to be petty.   \n\nYour comment was not that you were orchestrating your mom and sister hanging out together (which I would argue is not your job) but that you were orchestrating bonding between mom, sister, and your future mother in law. That is weird. I don't think there is any rule that says a young girl needs to be bonded to her older sister's husband's mother. \n\nYou may feel that's your role as bride.  I disagree.  And that's fine. No need to be so upset I find it weird.", ">Wedding planing is so simple and straightforward. I\n\nIt absolutely can be.  It only gets as complicated and stressful as you allow it to be.", "Girl YTA and need to stop. I can only imagine what a bridezilla you're being.", " NTA. I know someone who had 2 MOH\u2019s. Could that work?", "Your mother is correct, it's your wedding to plan.", "YTA. You were already TA from your post, but man, your indignant, defensive replies (when YOU came here asking for judgment) really seals the deal. I bet your sister and your mom find you so exhausting. The good news is that you can probably make sure the wedding food has enough salt.", "Is it not weird to expect a close friend/family member to take on all these responsibilities for YOUR wedding?? Wouldn't it cost a lot?? I didn't make my bridal party do anything?? We had a bachelorette we all planned together.", "YTa", "Yta", "You can\u2019t plan your own wedding because\u2026? YTA", "\ud83c\udfaf", "This is such an alien concept to me-- the expectation so many brides have these days of their MOHs and bridesmaids. It's like they think they and their weddings are SO special, the MOHs should be their willing slaves and sources of funds for everything THEY want to do pre, during and post-wedding.  Where did these expectations come from? I mean, all you can really expect is that they show up on time the day of, wear the dresses you chose together and pose for pictures. Then they help you with your dress so you can pee, give you support and love,  and that's about it. They are not there to work so you don't have to.  OP, YTA .", "OP\u2019s username checks out.", "And avatar."]}
