That often your spouse is home but you\u2019re still sleeping alone? Because it\u2019s understandable to want to sleep in the same bed as your partner, and it seems reasonable to have a conversation about that and frame it as how you\u2019re feeling. The stuff about his daughter, you note you feel embarrassed by it and are concerned about what others think but you know there\u2019s no issue in the relationship. I completely get how you would feel that way, but telling your spouse that he and his daughter need to change part of their relationship because it makes you feel embarrassed of what others think is just not the way to go.", "FFS can we just let people be close with their kids without putting all our own baggage on it??? YTA", "NAH. She is still a child, she just does not realise that adults might view it as something pervy. He\u2019s right, let them enjoy the few last bits of their time together before she stops doing that. My judgement remains the same unless you freaked out on him - communication is part of a healthy relationship. \n\nRegarding the bed, I understand that might be frustrating for you, so I believe you were in the right to voice your concerns. However, more information is needed in order to say anything about that one situation.", "YTA, He's right in saying there's only so much time. Why cut it short when soon enough she'll be too cool to spend time with her parents.\n\nBed is a bit more difficult to judge, If he just goes in there to sleep he should probably get used to going to his own bed. But for example there was a period of time when I was a kid where my dad worked odd hours. We'd often catch up after I was already in bed and he'd fall asleep in my or my siblings bad while we were telling him about our day.\n\nEDIT - Info: Is your stepdaughter's mother alive?", "YTA would you still have an issue with it if it was a mom and her daughter?", "Holy fuck YTA. Stop sexualizing his children! Let them be kids! Why would you sexualize the love children have for their father? How could you twist this to be a problem?\n\nHe is absolutely right. The days of her doing that are numbered. He is an amazing father for recognizing that. How dare you try to push them apart.", "YTA, what's your problem with that?? Let father and daughter enjoy their time..", "YTA \n\nIf you know of something sketchy going on, do something about it.

As the father of two now-grown daughters, I love when they sit next to me and still call me daddy.   And I sure miss those days when we\u2019d watch tv and I\u2019d stroke their hair and comb it with my fingers.   But, we never were that intimate in public, so thats a little odd to me as is co-sleeping.

This can translate to denied job opportunities, harassment, having CPS/DCF called on them, etc.  It can have very real consequences to be well outside the bounds of normal community behavior.", "13 is really young, they can be very childish and not adult in the slightest.
