{"id": 6852, "submission_id": "106xncx", "title": "AITA? Am I the a**hole for telling my mom she has to choose between me and her biological grandchild or her step daughter and her kid?", "selftext": " For context I (23F) my mom (42F) have generally always gotten along. She married my step dad (45M) about 14 years ago. He has 3 kids (24 F, 22M, and 20F) my mom has 2 kids (23 F and 19 F). Me and my sister were never a priority in our house. We always came last to my step siblings. All of my step sibling have kids and I am currently 25 week pregnant with my first. I do not live with my mom. I am married and living on my own even tho it\u2019s only a few blocks away from my moms house. My oldest step sister has hated me for about a year now. We would get in fights just like regular sisters do but I got tired of me always apologizing just because she wouldn\u2019t let me or my mom see my niece (5F) until I apologized. I didn\u2019t want to be the reason my mom didn\u2019t get to see her granddaughter. Now my step sister refuses to come around to anything I will be at. Family functions, our parents house, christmases, thanksgiving, anything. My step dad told me I couldn\u2019t go to 3 of my grandparents houses for Christmas because she wanted to go. I didn\u2019t fight back because I don\u2019t want to be the reason my grandmas don\u2019t get to see my niece. The other day I was at my moms house and her and my step dad told me to leave because they wanted my step sister and niece to come over and I wasn\u2019t allowed over. I had been there for hours at that point. If they had come to talk to me and told me that they wanted to come over it would be a different story. But they just kicked me out, no warning, nothing. I don\u2019t want to separate the family and I want my child to have the opportunity to play with their cousins and no have to deal with tension from family members and not have to deal with being told they have to leave because someone else wants to come over. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore because I know I have to do what\u2019s going to make my child happy in the long run. So am I the a**hole?\n\n\nSo sorry. Forgot to mention why we were fighting. She wanted me to help her get a house and a car. I told her I could co-sign for a car but as I\u2019m only 23yo I couldn\u2019t get approved to go-sign on a house. She accused me of hiding money and saying that I own my house. I do not own my house. I\u2019m and renting from a friend. She said that if I didn\u2019t give her $30,000 for a down payment she would tell our parents and I told her to go ahead and tell them because I would not be giving her that much money. She has always been petty like this and when someone doesn\u2019t give her exactly what she wants. She. Goes. Crazy.\n\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nSo sorry I know I left out some details. I had just gotten out a fight with my mom and step sister before I made this post and needed somewhere to vent and get advice.\n\nMy bio sister has been low contact with all of our step siblings and parents for about 2 years now. She saw all the crap that was going on our whole lives and she felt that she didn\u2019t want to be around any of it anymore. And I don\u2019t blame her. As for the other step siblings, they all think I am in the wrong for not giving her $30k. They think because I am married and have a husband that we have all this money we can throw away when that is not the case. They aren\u2019t as bad as the oldest and they do talk to me some but we don\u2019t see each other very often.\n\nAs for me not being invited to family function and everything else, as far as my side of the family is concerned, they know me and step sister had a huge fight and my parents have told them that I don\u2019t want to come around anymore. Which isn\u2019t true at all. I\u2019ve tried talking to my grandparents about it but they aren\u2019t listening. \n\nGrowing up my bio parents divorced when I was 7 and I spent weekends at my dads house. My mother would take the child support my dad sent for me and my sister and used it to pay for things my step siblings needed. I had to get a job at 14 to pay for clothes, food, phone, sports gear, and anything I needed for school. At 16 I had to get a loan from a bank to buy my first car while the child support my dad was sending was used to pay step sisters car payments after my mom paid for half her car upfront. I was forced to move out at 18 while my step siblings got to live in the house rent free, job free, and got everything paid for by our parents. While I was 2 months behind on rent from having Covid and my grandma and step mom passing away my parents told me I was on my own. I didn\u2019t even ask them for help, I was just ranting to my mom about it. After meeting my husband at 19, he helped me get back on my feet and helped me manage living on my own without feeling overwhelmed. He is supporting whatever decision I make. We don\u2019t get any financial help from my parents, sibling, or grandparents. \n\nMy step dad is the bread winner of their family and brings in all the money. My mom thinks she can\u2019t speak out against him or he takes all the money away. My step sister has since made a death threat to me and my baby because I told my mom she had to choose. I have blocked her on everything and will not talk to her anymore. \n\nThank you everyone for the advice and support!", "created_utc": 1673219859, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106xncx/aita_am_i_the_ahole_for_telling_my_mom_she_has_to/", "score": 628, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And since you asked what the better course of action is for your unborn child, I'll tell you: cutting them off and going NC with all of them. Almost every single one. (Minus your blood sister, since I see no mention of her siding w your stepsiblings).\n\nIf I were you, I would set some clearly boundaries and expectations for them now, before the baby comes. Tell them you have had enough of their favoritism and preferential treatment toward your stepsister, and you will not stand for it when your baby comes. Tell them that if they EVER want to meet your child or EVER spend any time w them, they're going to have to invite you to everything, never leave you or your family out again for the sake of your stepsister, and never force you home early just bc she's coming over. Tell them they're free to still invite stepsister and her family, bc you would never be so petty as to try and keep family away, but the way they've been treating you is unfair and damaging, particularly to a child who doesn't understand why they're being treated that way.\n\nBecause this behavior WILL continue after your child is born, OP. Even if you did manage to get more invites then before, they'll probably ask you AND your child to arrive extra early or late and then leave at a certain time, they'll give more oris better gifts to your stepsister's kids so that she doesn't get pissy and accuse them of favoring your child, etc. There will be SO MANY noticeable ways that they extend that unfair treatment to your child versus their cousins as well, and it's going to break your heart but you'll put up w it because you want your child to be able to spend time with their family.\n\nAnd I'm probably projecting, but I speak from experience, OP: It absolutely fucking sucks to be the child who is always be in second, third, FOURTH place. My siblings and I grew up spending every single holiday w our first cousins, and we ALL grew up to resent and almost despise those cousins we so loved, just because their mom constantly treated us like second rate citizens in our own home. Their mom was so entitled and self-involved, she babied and over-indulged her \"precious children\" at every turn (to the point of taking things away from us just to give to them), that eventually the kids picked up those terrible traits for themselves. And now none of us get along and the holidays are so much worse than if the cousins just weren't there. Trust me, OP, if there's anything kids pick up on it's injustice. A child ALWAYS knows when another child is being treated better, and they won't forgive it just because it's for the sake of \"family\" or \"keeping the peace.\" And your child won't forgive it, she won't be okay with it, instead she'll probably start hating your family for it.\n\nSave her the frustration and pain of being the least loved in a family of coddled narcissists. (My aunt still demands I cook for and feed for her precious baby boy whenever she has to go out, and I just want to deck her in front of her FULLY GROWN ADULT SON.)
