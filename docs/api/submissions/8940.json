But you're NTA for handling it your own way.", "Tell HR about this. You have every right to pump at work in privacy.", "Or try the \"stepped out\" sign and see if it satisfies everyone for a day or two?  You lock the door, so it seems like they would stop wiggling the knob if they think you're not in there.  Idk, I pumped and I can say that it's stressful just doing it.

My suggestion probably something like...\n\nStart with this about why you'd prefer to use your office, glide through the right to pump where you please, then tell them about people ignoring the DND sign. Then, very specifically ask what you should do, while asserting your rights. \"Given that I have a legal right to perform this medical procedure undisturbed in my office, and that coworkers are hindering the process, what do you propose I do?\" or some such. Idk, you can probably word it better with more time to think about it, lol. \n\nAnyway, make sure to record the convo if it's allowed where you live, get everything in writing, etc.\n\nThis is so absurdly unreasonable for you to need to do, but sadly, you never know if your workplace is one that will make it necessary until they make it necessary!\n\nAnd, obviously, NTA", "Exactly - why should she take resources from another nursing mother who isn\u2019t lucky enough to have their own office?

The women all worked out their own schedules and never had an issue, however you wouldn't believe how many times the pumping mothers had to throw young men out who used it as a nap room.
