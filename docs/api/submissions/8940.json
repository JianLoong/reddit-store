Having a sign, and granted what she does in her secure office, isn't an issue. If this sign said \"masturbating\" or \"checking for rabies\" I'd have the same issue. \n\nFyi, the way I'm interpreting the pump now is as a medical device intended to assist with relieving milk from the mother, that makes it a medical issue, and the sign could even say \"Back in 15, tending medical needs.\"\n\n But to be so crass as to announce \"I'm pumping breast milk\" is, again, putting your private matters onto others that are uncomfortable with it.\n\nAnd honestly, I would go so far as to say ESH because I wouldn't even have said anything about the sign.
