To be honest, I think right now your key priority/focus is not your sister or even your sister's relationship with you... but rather the vulnerable child/children who now are in the picture. If I were in your shoes, I think I would unfortunately probably consider my sister lost to the abuser because she keeps choosing him, but I'd be very concerned about my niece and her safety, and making all decisions abou how to proceed with an eye towards being involved enough in the \\*child's life\\* to be aware of any abuse and to get them out of the abuse if necessary and when possible.", "NTA, and next time, call the police, especially if there is a child involved.", "*NOPE*, NTA.", "NTA just tell her you will always be there for her ( because he will try to isolate her) but you cannot support or condone a relationship where she is abused especially since they now have children who witness that abuse at the very least.", "NTA. Don't say yes. If you say yes, you are enabling his behavior and not taking a stand for your sister. Your sister is doing this to herself. She's doing nothing to help her or her child and continues to stay in a bad situation. Do what you can to protect your niece or nephew, but stay away from your sister. If you get the chance to file a report again, do it. Don't even hesitate.", " As others have said--at this point, you're trying to help the kids as well as your sister.\n\n Her future husband would love for you to be shut out of their lives, & sadly--if you refuse this offer, he'll use that to get you \"banned.\"\n\n   I'd say *\"I will stand up with you, I'll put on a smile, but there won't be a MOH speech about how wonderful this is. I want us to stay close, and that's why I'm agreeing. You are my sister.\"*", "YWBTA if you say yes \n\nyou would be enabling her in to a bad marriage\n\nIt is the same as before. \n\nBe prepared for the backlash though", "NTA - If anything you would be the AH for going along with it knowing full well he is abusive", "NTA\n\nLets say your sister had a healthy relationship. You can still say no as it's your life. \n\nNow back to reality where your sister is dating an abusive AH. You can still say no. Tell her why for the same reasons you gave 7 years ago. Tell her you will be there for her but you can't support this wedding.", "Hi there, from what I read I am gathering your niece is around 4 years young. Why don't you propose to your sister that you keep your niece occupied throughout the day of the wedding. While everyone is getting ready, you will help your niece get ready and keep her out of everyone else's way. Tell your sister you will even practice with your niece walking down the aisle (so she doesn't get nervous or scared). Then let her know that during the ceremony you will tell your niece when it is time for her to walk down the aisle. Tell her you were also make sure that your niece is ready for the pictures, and when she's not in them, you will keep her occupied. And then tell her you would like for your niece to stay close to you during the reception and you will be more than happy to make sure she eats, dances she gets to say some Hello's... and then tell her if your niece starts getting tired or cranky, you will be more than happy to take her home with you.\n\nThis is killing more than two birds with one stone. First you will be at the wedding, but not in it in any position that you are not comfortable with. Second you are advocating for your niece. You will be watching her and making sure she doesn't get hurt or in people's way. Third your niece will absolutely love spending that day and evening with you. (Make sure you get lots of pictures of you and your niece). Fourth you are planting the seed in your sister with an idea that she might not be able to pass up. We hope this helps you sunshine xoxo", "A lot of people are saying don\u2019t be the MOH, and I\u2019m not saying you would be in the wrong if you said no but consider the effect saying no might have on your niece. Would it lead to another lengthy estrangement? If so, you\u2019d likely be unable to help your niece. \n\nIt would be excruciating, I\u2019m sure, to stand by your sister\u2019s side while she marries her abuser. But would the repercussions of not doing it be greater? Not an asshole either way, you just have a really fucking tough decision to make. I wish you all the best.", "Why is every other post here about weddings? At this point people can just search this sub and find an identical scenario that fits theirs.

You love your sister but don't want to support a bad decision. You aren't throwing it away.", "Oh hell nah...  \n\n\nDefinitely NTA  \n\n\nAbusive cycles in relationships are nightmares for the victims and those on the sidelines. I am so sorry for your sister not being able to get her head up and out of that.. and I'm equally sorry you have to witness it. But you are perfectly in the right for not wanting to take part in that wedding, pretending it's everything it's not.", "NTA", "NTA and your sister refuses to leave her abuser and I don't know how you can change her mind on that. Where are your parents in all this? Are they around? Do they know their grandchild lives with an abusive father? Call the cops the second he does anything again.", "NTA. Sometimes being supportive is the worst thing you can do for someone who won't help themselves. You should repeat what you said the first time, 'I cannot support you furthering an abusive relationship'.", "NTA - the situation is the same as it was before. I wouldn't do it either.", "NTA.  Stick to your guns. There is no reason you should endorse your sister's refusal to keep herself and your niece out of a physically abusing situation by accepting a major role in her wedding to her abuser.", "Stop supporting her entirely", "NTA. MOH is expected to give a toast and you really will have nothing good to say unless you lie and you obviously are not willing to do that. I couldn\u2019t do it either. \n\nBut, you need to stay connected to your sister. She needs to know she has a safe place to go when she needs to leave him again. I know it is heartbreaking to watch and frustrating as hell because you love her but it\u2019s so important. It took my sister in law over 20 years to finally leave for good and it was worth every second we had to deal with the jackass for that 20 years. Being there for our nephews and being good examples of what life can be like with love not violence paid off in the end. Even if he never hits the kids, he is going to do massive damage to them.", "NTA- in this situation, it\u2019s not simply a clash of personalities stopping you  supporting this union, it\u2019s domestic violence. \n\nYour sister is in a cycle. Remove yourself as an enabler and tell her she needs professional help to leave him before he kills her.", "YWNBTA", "NTA.  You are fully entitled to say no, even without all the extra stuff.", "NTA. Let her know you'll be there for her when she needs a place of refuge, but your original reasoning still holds true. You DON'T support the union, and you WON'T publicly appear to do so.\n\nBut do let her know she can come to you. It's really hard to rescue victims of spousal abuse; they're almost mind-controlled, they keep going back. I know it's frustrating, but you can't force her to leave.", "Yeah I'd say no. And tell her not to bother with the next \"you're right\" apology either.", "Well you could be the biggest B on the planet, say yes to her and then have a word with the person marrying them to make sure they say the line \"If anyone here has a reason why they shouldn't be married, speak now or forever hold your peace\" you could always then speak up...but this isn't petty revenge and you're probably going about this in a better way of not supporting her being her MOH.  NTA of course.", "NTA. You have every right to decline someone's request to be their MOH regardless of why. Especially considering you have a very valid reason for not supporting their relationship.", "They say it takes an average of 7 times of leaving the abuser before they actually leave. I hope your sister leaves well before then, but in the meantime keep in contact and be there for her and especially your niece. I am sure their well being is more important to you than being a part of the wedding you don't want to happen. You're a good sister and this is a very difficult situation. NTA", "That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s driving me more for this decision. The first time, the only one to face the consequences of her choice was herself.\nBut this time it\u2019s not her, they have a child now. It\u2019s not right, the kid has no choice. \nI\u2019m just upset that she\u2019s choosing him over herself and child. She has a responsibility to protect her and this .. this is the opposite.", "This. Absolutely. In the moment, it may feel like you are compromising your morals, but the reality is, you have your eye on a much more pressing matter. You need to reframe the role of MOH to be about supporting the bride in her relationship (which you will be and have been), rather than celebrating the marriage with the bride. You can decline to do a speech or any activity that outwardly condones the union. It's a fine line, but it is possible to walk.", "It\u2019s a regret I hold every day. No children were there that day, but I still should have called.", "The first time, the chose was hers. But she has a child now and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for the kid to watch that or be involved. The child has no choice and she should be protecting her.", "Again, your purpose is no longer to make your sister see the light. She hasn't and probably won't. The more pressing ethical question is just how to navigate these wedding issues in a way you can stay in the niece's life and be an advocate for her. I'd personally try to avoid being in the MOH position for the reasons you cite about not wanting to seem to endorse the marriage -- but honestly, if that was truly the only way to stay in contact with the kid, I'd do it. Spies have done far dicier things in order to be in the right position to make a difference where it mattered. If one day you are there to document him abusing your niece and can actually advocate for her in the courts, wearing the stupid maid-of-honor dress will have been worth it.", "File that report man. Your sisters a lost cause but your niece isn't.", "This\u2026is an idea I had not thought of. I\u2019ve been more worried about my niece who doesn\u2019t have a voice. And if I get cut off again, I\u2019m scared of what might happen behind closed doors.", "I said it in another comment but it bears repeating. Even if he never hits the kids, he will do massive damage to them. They will be pawns he will manipulate to hurt their mother. He will tell them that it\u2019s mommy\u2019s fault for being so stupid. He will accuse them of being stupid if they stand up for mommy. You know of specific instances of abuse. You may be able to contact children\u2019s services and get the family on their radar. Your sister can\u2019t know it was you though.", "As a child who was abused and mom cut everyone off for trying to make her leave the abuser, please stay in your niece's life any way you can. Swallow your anger, raise that stupid glass to the happy couple, and keep your niece close. As close as you can. \n\nPlease \u2665\ufe0f NTA but please \u2665\ufe0f"]}
