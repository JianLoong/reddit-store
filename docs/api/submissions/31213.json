Sounds like you could use some medical assistance, but everyone's periods are different.  You mom sounds very un-empathetic. \n\nAlso, ask your Mom what her pregnancy was like.  If it was anything but sunshine and roses, she's being an asshole because some women have very chill, easy pregnancies.  By that logic she hopefully never uttered one word of complaint with her less than picture-perfect pregnancy.  \n\nI never had a minute of morning sickness, but I know better than to condescend and be an asshole to my friends that spent close to 10 months throwing up all the time.", ">I'm sure it's like that for most people\n\nThe experience differs vastly.

Just because your mom didn't have the same issues during her period, that doesn't mean your experience is less valid. Every woman deals with different symptoms during their period but if you're truly having bad pains and discomfort you should see a doctor, it could be a sign of something else happening that needs to be treated. Idk how old you are and I don't want to scare you, but as a woman who also deals with pain during their monthly cycle, it's better to talk to a professional just to make sure you're going to be okay.

I am a woman in a house full of women and none of us had experiences like this. You need to seek medical advice and unfortunately you need to be extremely consistent in doing that, because doctors (especially male ones) tend to diminish women's pain and issues for years. But I assure you that kind of symptoms, with such force, are not normal. And you don't have \"to deal with it\" either. If so, your parents should deal with aching joints, headaches, and the likes, because they are \"natural\". Dying of preventable diseases is \"natural\" too and I don't see them doing it.

Your periods should not be so debilitating that you can't do basic functions, and i'm saying that as someone who's been through it.

Insensitive As*holes in direct speach is mighty strong language, though. Periods ARE normal, but not all periods are the same. There are disorders that amongst other things make you have painful, debilitating periods. Have you seen a doctor about this? You should do that as soon as possible. Some of these disorders are quite serious. And if nothing else, the doctor could recommend some effective pain killers.", "It's not normal to be nauseous and dizzy during a period. You gyn should have offered to help you find some drugs to help out.\n\nI found being put on progesterone helped as I never had periods afterwards, I would still get the odd day or so of cramps, but it was minimal.

My high school best friend would be sick to her stomach for a few days. I myself sometimes can barely move because the pain is unbearable. Definitely talk to your doctor.\n\nFor nausea, get alcohol wipes. Tear open the pack and smell it when your stomach starts turning. It stops my nausea pretty quick. Maybe you\u2019re anemic, getting dizzy when you stand, my daughter is anemic due to lupus, she has more white than red blood cells. She gets dizzy standing up, plus her blood pressure drops severely when she showers. \n\nI hope you get the help you need and deserve.

Sometimes doctors can also be dismissive assholes.\n\nIn the meantime for cramps if the usual heating pad (or hot bath if you don't have a heating pad) + pain killer doesn't help, you can try a rectal pain killer. It sounds odd but it's a lot more effective than the oral painkillers. Speaking from experience.", "The only symptom that you could call normal are the cramps you mention and I used to sort mine out by taking soluble aspirin at the start of mine and the first couple of days. If you try that make sure you stick to the dosage recommended on the package.
