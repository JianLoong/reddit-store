I think it would be a good idea for you to consult a doctor about this; you shouldn't be suffering so much.\n\nAs for your parents, your mother especially should know that periods can be absolutely crippling. You're not being lazy, and you shouldn't have to suck it up and push through it.", "NTA\n\nPeriods are different for different women.  Some women have mild periods.  Some have extremely painful/debilitating periods.\n\nI'd suggest a trip to your doctor or gynecologist as your symptoms seem extreme enough to be something you should seek some management for rather than just suffering them because \"it's a period\".  You may have something like endometriosis.\n\nAnd your dad can be quiet entirely.  Unless he's had a period at least once in his life, he doesn't get to speak about them at all.", "NTA Sweetie that is not normal. While discomfort is standard for menstruaron, you\u2019re experiencing unusual extremes. You may be anemic, and should speak with your doctor.", "NTA. Period symptoms that severe are not normal. You might have endometriosis or a similar issue. I would look into it if I were you, and bring it up with your doctor the next time you have an appointment.", "NTA\n\nOP please go to see a doctor that doesn't some like just normal period crams", "NTA, talk to your doctor about the extreme pain.  Sounds like you could use some medical assistance, but everyone's periods are different.  You mom sounds very un-empathetic. \n\nAlso, ask your Mom what her pregnancy was like.  If it was anything but sunshine and roses, she's being an asshole because some women have very chill, easy pregnancies.  By that logic she hopefully never uttered one word of complaint with her less than picture-perfect pregnancy.  \n\nI never had a minute of morning sickness, but I know better than to condescend and be an asshole to my friends that spent close to 10 months throwing up all the time.", ">I'm sure it's like that for most people\n\nThe experience differs vastly. I think you might be on the -- let's call it -- extremely unfortunate end of things in the spectrum, but it's by no means the rule. There are people who don't even notice, and there are those heavily affected. Still, I think you should get that checked out, to be honest.\n\nMy recommendation would be to get a little snippet of paper from your gynaecologist, it might also help you with your employer later on.\n\nRegarding the case at hand:\n\n**NTA** (obviously)\n\nSome people are just ignorant about this issue (both men and women).", "NTA and please go to the doctor.

On another note you should go to a dr because your symptoms are quite extreme.", "NTA. My experience of periods and my besties experiences are complete opposites. I have it easy, i still see and understand because i trust what she is saying. I dont know if anything can be improved but if possible, see a gyno because sometimes there are things that can be done to minimise the issues from periods.", "NTA. Just because your mom didn't have the same issues during her period, that doesn't mean your experience is less valid. Every woman deals with different symptoms during their period but if you're truly having bad pains and discomfort you should see a doctor, it could be a sign of something else happening that needs to be treated. Idk how old you are and I don't want to scare you, but as a woman who also deals with pain during their monthly cycle, it's better to talk to a professional just to make sure you're going to be okay. I'm sorry your parents don't take you seriously about this, I know how frustrating it can be.", "NTA, I feel you my period usually gears my depression into overdrive and makes me want to kms (figuratively and literally) but fevers not normal for periods. You should see a doctor.", "NTA. I\u2019m hardly an expert, but those don\u2019t sound like standard period symptoms, I\u2019d speak to a doctor", "NTA\n\nYou need to speak to a Doctor about this.", "Dear OP, that is not normal. I am a woman in a house full of women and none of us had experiences like this. You need to seek medical advice and unfortunately you need to be extremely consistent in doing that, because doctors (especially male ones) tend to diminish women's pain and issues for years. But I assure you that kind of symptoms, with such force, are not normal. And you don't have \"to deal with it\" either. If so, your parents should deal with aching joints, headaches, and the likes, because they are \"natural\". Dying of preventable diseases is \"natural\" too and I don't see them doing it. Tell them to pound sand, you have horrible parents. But really, OP, that is not natural or normal.", "NTA.  Woman with endometriosis here to chime in! Please go see a doctor. Your periods should not be so debilitating that you can't do basic functions, and i'm saying that as someone who's been through it. My cramps were so horrible, I was doubled over in pain, puking, all.the.time. I couldn't perform daily tasks. It's not normal. \n\nI'm not saying you have endo, but you could have something going on that could be treated and give you some relief. You shouldn't have to suffer like this, honey.", "ESH.\n\nIf you're really in that much pain every time you get your period, you need to go to the doctor and figure out what's wrong. Instead, you're just using it as an excuse to just sit around every time you have your period. Your parents should obviously know better and should have taken you to a doctor about this long ago.", "Everyone is a asshole. \n\nYta for thinking anybody out there gives a fck if you on your period or not . Have fun telling your boss you don't come to work because of it.\n\nNta for beeing in pain and have a reaction to it. \n\nGet your sht together, all of you.", "NTA", "Have you thought about seeing a doctor? This doesn't sound like typical period symptoms. Maybe a medical professional can help your parents see what's up.", "NTA! Go see a doctor ASAP!", "NTA. My periods are pretty bad, to the point where I am medicated to reduce the bleeding and pain. And what you are describing is way worse. It is not within normal and you should see a doctor about it.", "NTA I have Endo and that's why mines was as bad as yours. Thankfully my mother and grandmother experienced extremely painful periods so I wasn't dismissed. Definitely speak to a doctor.", "Please talk to your doctor about this. Pain isn\u2019t unusual but to the extent you describe, I think it\u2019s something more than that. NTA obviously", "NTA and you need to see obgyn", "> I'm sure it's like that for most people who get periods\n\nAhhh I wouldn't be so sure about that, I suggest checking it out with a doctor. \n\nAnyway, regardless of the reason, your parents shouldn't dismiss that you are in pain. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI'd suggest going to another gynaecologist. What you're experiencing doesn't sound normal at all. \n\nThere could be a lot of reasons for this and unfortunately, a lot of gynaecologists don't take it seriously. \n\nWhile it could be benign, it could also be PCOS, endometriosis, adenomyosis, and so many other illnesses.", "NTA. \n\nAnd even if you went to a gyn already - please seek for a second opinion. Period pain on this level is definetely not normal and unfortunately, there are some gynaecologists who still have no idea of endometriosis. Many women have to bear this over 10 years to get finally diagnosed. Especially the cramps all over the body are a really bad sign which differs vastly from \"normal\" period pain.", "NTA. Insensitive As*holes in direct speach is mighty strong language, though. Periods ARE normal, but not all periods are the same. There are disorders that amongst other things make you have painful, debilitating periods. Have you seen a doctor about this? You should do that as soon as possible. Some of these disorders are quite serious. And if nothing else, the doctor could recommend some effective pain killers.", "It's not normal to be nauseous and dizzy during a period. You gyn should have offered to help you find some drugs to help out.\n\nI found being put on progesterone helped as I never had periods afterwards, I would still get the odd day or so of cramps, but it was minimal. Prior to that, the doctor tried various meds line prescription strength ibuprofen and Naprosyn. That was decades ago and i am sure they have other tools in their toolchest of medical tricks.\n\nNTA", "[PMDD](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/308332#_noHeaderPrefixedContent)\n\nIt\u2019s a more severe form of pms and not everyone gets it. My high school best friend would be sick to her stomach for a few days. I myself sometimes can barely move because the pain is unbearable. Definitely talk to your doctor.\n\nFor nausea, get alcohol wipes. Tear open the pack and smell it when your stomach starts turning. It stops my nausea pretty quick. Maybe you\u2019re anemic, getting dizzy when you stand, my daughter is anemic due to lupus, she has more white than red blood cells. She gets dizzy standing up, plus her blood pressure drops severely when she showers. \n\nI hope you get the help you need and deserve. I couldn\u2019t imagine dismissing my children\u2019s pain simply because I\u2019ve never experienced it.\n\nEdit: NTA not in the least.", "NTA, periods suck, but what you're experiencing is extreme. Go see a *different* doctor than the one who said you're fine. You're not fine, this shouldn't be something you're expected to \"deal with\". Sometimes doctors can also be dismissive assholes.\n\nIn the meantime for cramps if the usual heating pad (or hot bath if you don't have a heating pad) + pain killer doesn't help, you can try a rectal pain killer. It sounds odd but it's a lot more effective than the oral painkillers. Speaking from experience.", "The only symptom that you could call normal are the cramps you mention and I used to sort mine out by taking soluble aspirin at the start of mine and the first couple of days. If you try that make sure you stick to the dosage recommended on the package. The remaining symptoms you mention are definitely not normal, nausea dizziness etc makes me think you may be anaemic so I would definitely recommend you go and see your GP.", "What OP is describing is *not normal* and she\u2019s not going to magically \u201cget her shit together\u201d without medical intervention.", "Never said any of that.", "Let me guess. You are either a man or a woman that was fortunate enough to have normal period discomfort.", "Nah, i don't let you guess."]}
