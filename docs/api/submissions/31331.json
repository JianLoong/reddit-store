My bio dad came to live with us a few years back and he\u2019s a garbage human.

I was raised by my grandmother for my own safety because of his actions if that says anything. He has no self control in general, especially when it comes to food. He\u2019s become morbidly obese and has multiple health issues, and he refuses to get a job again or apply for disability so he can move out. \n\nHe assumes anything that we have he\u2019s allowed to take and do what he wants as well, even without asking. With food, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s fast food leftovers or personal snacks and sweets written in black sharpie. He\u2019ll eat the entire thing to himself in one sitting and will verbally berate the people he stole from for being upset, telling us to \u201csuck it up\u201d. My grandmother basically coddles him now because of trauma regarding her sisters passing and she refuses to evict him. She\u2019s even taken personal foods of mine to adjust more to his liking, such as taking a small chicken dish I made for myself and adding extra stuff in it without asking me first so her \u201cbaby boy\u201d would be able to enjoy it as well. \n\nA while back, I had to make some food for on the go because I would be out hiking in areas around town. I like to eat spicy things, and I decided to do something different so he would hopefully get the message. With a mixture of chipotle ranch, cholula and other things, I made sandwiches. But for the twist, I added a little ghost pepper to the one in front of the fridge while the rest were pushed to the back. Again I wrote in bold sharpie my name and to not touch. First day I went out, none of them had been touched when I got back. Later that night, I was awoken to my dad shrieking from the living room couch for my younger brother to get him iced tea. He honestly believed he was having a heart attack. I just laughed to myself from the other room. After that he didn\u2019t touch them but he kept calling me a \u201csmart ass\u201d and other names or insults through the week. My grandmother says I went too far because he\u2019s \u201ccrippled and he could die soon\u201d. I didn\u2019t care because he\u2019s not a good person anyways, but some other family think that I went too far.

I was happy to share but nope he would wait till you went down the shop to grab something and would eat the lot and think it was funny.  So I made some chocolate treats with fruit soaked in alcohol only I made a separate batch and used laxatives.  I got up in the morning to find he hadn't gone to work and was in an out of the toilet.  I did say to him before heading to bed not to eat more than 2 because they were rich knowing he would eat the lot.  I retrieved the other good batch from the fridge and shared them with his partner but kept it to a few each.  He didn't want any.  It took me years before I could actually tell someone who knew what he was like when we were younger without laughing my head off.  Yep, it was priceless!", "NTA. UNLESS it was poison.
