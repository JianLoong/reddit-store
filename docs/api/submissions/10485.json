Our relationship has been great, but recently, my girlfriend has become increasingly upset at the fact that I hang out with my friends more. \n\nWe usually call every single day after she finishes class and we stay on call until both of us fall asleep. I try to be as present as I can with her during the time that we are on call. If she starts talking about something that interests her, I always engage in conversation. Usually, when I wake up, she shares a bunch of tiktoks with me over screen share and I react happily even if it\u2019s a hundred and I am watching for an hour or two. This happens every day, and not to mention we usually watch a show together for a few hours sometime later in the day as well. \n\nThe problem arises when I start gaming with my friends. Most of my friends are also long-distance and online friends that I\u2019ve been hanging out with for over a decade. We have sporadic gaming sessions maybe 2-3 days out of the week. When I tell her that I am going to a game with my friends, she gets upset and clingy. \n\nWe started having a system where she could request I take a break from my friends for an hour to hang out with her before she went to sleep, but it also gets annoying to leave in the middle of hanging out with my friends. Usually, my friends and I game until late at night, so my girlfriend is normally asleep during part of our gaming sessions. However, she also has an issue with me not going to bed with her or staying on call for her to fall asleep because she sometimes has trouble sleeping alone. \n\nLast night, she revealed that she was holding onto a lot of resentment over the past few weeks about me gaming with my friends every weekend. She complained that I do not give her the same type of attention that I do to my friends and that she wishes that she wouldn\u2019t feel outright neglected when I game with my friends. She also admitted that when I game with my friends, she feels really lonely and it causes her to spiral more. I told her that I understood, but I couldn\u2019t just forego every opportunity to hang out with my friends and it\u2019s toxic to expect me to do so. I also don\u2019t know how to offer her any more reassurance because I literally text her at least every hour even when I am gaming with my friends, but she complains that my texts are too \u201cdry\u201d. \n\nI then suggested to her that she should hang out with her friends more often and take up her own hobbies so that she isn\u2019t always waiting for me to come back from gaming with my friends. This really upset her and she broke down crying on call last night and has been sending very dull text messages all day so I know she\u2019s still upset.

People in a relationship need time for themselves too. It\u2019s not fair for her to demand 100% of your time when she isn\u2019t even physically present. It sounds like she has some issues to work through, first by herself and then maybe with you too, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with you having time with your friends or even just by yourself.

You have every right to have a human life and have interaction with friends, other people in the real world and entertaining yourself with your gaming friends.   \nYou cannot be expected to live your life attached to her through your phone 24/7.

I think you need to set firm boundaries with the understanding that she\u2019s still important to you. If you choose to stay in this relationship that is.", "NTA. It's not normal to restrict your partner in this way. I won't repeat what everyone else is saying here but I will say that if you choose to keep bending to her wants you will damage your friendships. Don't do that. Healthy relationships consist of both parties having their own social activities with others or hobbies. She's made you her whole world and that's seriously damaging for you, your friendships and your relationship. Once you're together in person it won't get better. I'm glad you called it out as toxic.

You need to have a serious conversation about this with a preparedness to break up if she doesn't stop forcing you to constantly work your entire life around her desires.", "NTA.  I'm here to tell you from the other side that this is a warning flag - you are not able to give her the amount of attention she needs to feel secure and its not going to change.  \n\nThat's not a blaming statement, just simple facts. She needs a lot of attention, that's who she is.  You have varied interests and what to keep balance for your own mental health.  It's a bad match.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She needs to learn to function alone. Ya'll are so codependent here that it is already toxic. You need to keep your alternate support system and she needs to find one.", "NTA- She is going to suck all the life out of you. You aren't responsible for her mental health. R U N!", "NTA at all. Been in a long distance going on 3 years. It's great being able to spend hours a day with each other on the phone but you also need to be able to take breaks and not spiral, too. She can't rely on you 24/7 for her emotional state. it's just not realistic. She needs to have hobbies, alone time, time with friends, too. And yeah check in with each other during, sure, but doesn't need to be full hours at a time. \n\nSounds like she wasn't always so demanding of your time? Has something happened in her life where she is that could be making her feel less secure?", "NTA. She sounds annoying and clingy. You are totally entitled to have separate time away from her. Does she not have a life outside of you? I don\u2019t understand how someone can be that clingy", "NTA - dear lord, run now, this problem will persist in person as well and you will find yourself with no friends and only gf controlling every move you make.", "NTA is she is horrendously dependent on you and it only seems to be getting worse. \n\nThis sounds exhausting and action needs to be taken now. She sounds like she needs therapy. \n\nIt\u2019s unhealthy and not feasible to rely on someone this heavily", "NTA. Speaking as someone in a LDR, I can understand wanting as much time as you can get with your SO. But your girlfriend isn\u2019t giving you space to live your life. Both of you can and should have lives outside of being partners. \n\nSounds to me like you\u2019re her only social contact. Does she have any friends at all? If she doesn\u2019t, you need to ask yourself why. It could be a sign about how she is as a person.", "I dated a woman like this. It was EXHAUSTING. No matter what you give it\u2019s never enough. She has her own issues to deal with. Being co dependent and controlling are not going to fix them. \n\nNTA\n\nGood luck", "NTA. Does your girlfriend have hobbies and friends? Genuine question, no judgement. She might be more upset that you sort of accidentally called out how boring and sad her life is, rather than actually being upset at you for wanting to game (or maybe I'm just projecting because I've been there). Long distance relationships are hard, but the way yours is right now sounds probably unhealthy. It sounds like you're on call or watching her tiktoks for probably 6-8 hours a day. That's not super great for either of you. Maybe you can help/encourage her to get a hobby? She could try out things she liked to do as a kid if she doesn't know where to start: sports, reading, games (video or board), and various arts and crafts can all be done as an adult. Friends are hard to make sometimes but it sounds like she's still in school, could she talk with classmates to make friends, or join a club? Maybe reconnect with old friends she's fallen out of touch with?\n\nI do feel for her, but it's not good for either of you for her to rely on you completely for connection and entertainment. She needs to let you have time for you to do other things, and she needs to have other things to do too.", "NTA at all\n\nA LOT of women will \"vacation\" in men's lives because they don't have a lot of hobbies. It's unhealthy. Couples need time apart. Her behavior isn't unusual, but it's not okay either.", "NAH\n\nShe love you man. The more you do things independently the more she will love and respect you. As long as it doesn\u2019t turn into nagging then I think you have a keeper.", "My gf and I do this. We\u2019re just on the phone while doing whatever we need to (studying, cleaning, etc). But we\u2019re fine whenever the other has plans or something. I think a fair amount of long distance couples do this. But it does become a codependency problem if they need so much constant attention that you can\u2019t have a social life", "You came back from the dead to tell him that? I'm impressed by your dedication! \ud83d\ude01", "How she reacts to his spending time with others- hurting her own feelings telling herself he's robbing her of the 100% attn she expects, and playing the victim.  Red flags all.", "Don't only blame women, men do this too.", "Yeah my SO and I do the same. Honestly we can be on the phone 7+ hours a day but we're doing all the other stuff at the same time and can 100% take breaks and do our own things, too. It's not much different I don't think than living with someone. You come from from work and spend the rest of the day with them (while doing other stuff together or around the house, etc)", "Lol, well from dead relationships, perhaps !", "They didn't say only women do it.", "Yeah but it's way more common for women than for men"]}
