I live in another country 3500 miles from my parents who are retired and are coming to stay with us for 2 weeks before & 3.5 months after the birth to help out because its high risk pregnancy/delivery due to chronic illness & a C-section. My husband travels for work & is gone multiple times a month. \n\nI am the eldest, and this will be my parents first granddaughter but my younger sister Ashley 28f has 4 boys ages: 9, 7, 3,1. Ashley & I are not close and she\u2019s always in a mess. She\u2019s recently divorced from husband #4, has moved back in with ex-husband #1 father of her oldest & he isn\u2019t the nicest guy, especially to the younger boys. \n\nHere\u2019s where the real problems lie, her 3 year old *Tyler is extremely bright but clearly has undiagnosed autism, he\u2019s difficult to handle for my sister, has delayed speech, struggles with behavior and in Ashley\u2019s own words \u201ctoo hard to manage alone\u201d so my parents keep Tyler 3-4 nights a week. Tyler\u2019s father is not in the picture and the only male bonds he has are with my dad & husband. My parents were very excited about coming to stay when my daughter is born until they realized it meant leaving Tyler behind with his mom. \n\nA week ago my mom made a \u201cjoke\u201d about bringing Tyler with and I said I didn\u2019t think this was a good idea, she quickly agreed & changed the subject. Last night my sister sent me a text asking about the logistics of getting Tyler a passport (a requirement to travel to us) so our parents could bring him along. When I told her that I didn\u2019t feel like this was a good idea because it was too short notice to get him a passport, things were going to be stressful & chaotic, & ultimately I said he couldn\u2019t come. \n\nShe BLEW up! Calling me a selfish AH before blocking me (this is typical behavior). My dad then called and said that Ashley told them she would quit her job if they left Tyler behind because there was no possible way she could work & take care of the other boys & Tyler for those 4 months & her ex she\u2019s living with refuses to help with the younger boys especially Tyler. \n\nI told my dad that if that was the case and they weren\u2019t coming unless they brought Tyler that maybe they shouldn\u2019t come, & they could make a trip later on. This sent my mom into crying hysterics & Ashley called leaving dozens of voice/text messages cursing me out, calling me all sorts of horrible names, & telling me she hoped both I & my daughter die during child birth. This went on until my husband made me turn my phone off because I was now extremely upset and physically ill. My concern is that with my own C-section recovery & health issues I already face, having Tyler underfoot with a newborn will just be too much. I adore my nephew but even my parents struggle with him. Now I\u2019m feeling incredibly guilty because everyone is upset. So am I the AH for saying no?", "created_utc": 1687792137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jjvh4/aita_for_telling_my_family_my_nephew_cant_come/", "score": 643, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s your house, your first baby, your comfort level that matters.   She\u2019s abdicated parenting one of her children to your parents and they\u2019d like to be free of that a bit to visit.  This is something that she and your parents need to work out, not you. \n\n[Sidebar: Maybe you should ask your parents to make it a shorter visit without Tyler and think about rotating your in-laws in for some time? I know you probably would rather have your mother the whole time (I get it!) but this could be a good compromise if in-laws are helpful people]\n\nShe wished you would die?  Hold your line.  Better to be without any extra help than deal with all this crap.   Congrats and I hope everything goes great!", "NTA \n\nThere's so much I want to say but no idea where to start...\n\nYour sister shouldn't of kept popping them out if she couldn't handle having that many kids. Shipping a kid off doesn't make them less difficult, getting them help does ... so why hasn't she figured out those means yet? ... calling you selfish is just, I don't even know where to go with that ... \n\nAll in all .. You've said whats needed to be said. Now sit back and focus on you and baby and don't stress for another dang minute over it. Plan for them not coming and plan to send them home if he shows up with them, that would be my fear around having them come at all at this point... I wouldn't trust that they wouldn't just think \"well she can't turn us away if we are there\" ... yes you can! \n\nGood luck!", "Wow. NTA. Your sister is a disaster and I think you should never have contact with her again. Tell your parents not to bring Tyler or else don\u2019t come. Did you tell them what your sister said to you? \n\nDon\u2019t spare another thought about this. Lay the boundaries out and let it go. Congratulations on the new family.", "NTA.

It is your life, your child.   You make the decisions.  Best of luck.", "NTA \n\nThey are coming to help you out. They will not be able to because they will be wrapped up in nephew and his care instead. You will be on your own, except for having to deal with high maintenance toddlers. It will be easier on you to be alone and learn to parent solo rather than deal with that. Tell your parents if they absolutely need to watch him, you understand and will fly out for a visit to them in a few years, but will send a photo instead. And start looking for friend or doula to help you.", "NTA, your family needs help.", "NTA. \n\nI feel for your sister, I have a 2.5 year old with autism, 2 older boys and a baby on the way. It\u2019s a struggle. But she\u2019s been extremely fortunate your parents have been helping out as they have, because not everyone is that lucky to have ANY help. Saying this, she will survive 4 months without your parents there to help. \n\nShe owes you an apology, or your parents need to tell her that it isn\u2019t right she wished death to you and your sister. Honestly if I were your parents I\u2019d stop taking Tyler for a bit just for that comment alone and have her deal with her kids alone. \n\nThe 3 other baby daddies can step in extra for their kids while your parents are out of town so she can focus on her son. \n\nYour only worry needs to be your health, and meeting your daughter. I hope delivery & recovery go smoothly for you.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is annoyed she is loosing free child care for a while and strong arming your parents into letting Tyler come. 100% certified AH there.\n\nHer situation is not great and that's sad, and I feel sorry for her.

Not only that, but young kids tend to carry all kinds of germs and really shouldn't be around a newborn. You have every right to insist that he stays home.\n\nYour sister is a real piece of work. Entitled, selfish and unbelievably rude. She needs to have backup arrangements for her child anyway. What if your parents can't watch him, or need a break?

You sound like a great mom already, prioritizing the well being of your child.  I understand the fear of leaving Ashley alone with her children because she doesn't seem to know how to do that...

Stick to  your boundaries, don't let that negativity into your home!", "NTA\n\nI feel like your mum should visit to help and your father should stay and help with Tyler if they are this torn. That would be a compromise. Now I am not saying this to help your entitled sister AT ALL!! This solution would be the best for you, your daughter and Tyler I think.\n\nIf he is autistic I am pretty sure he would also prefer to stay with familiar person in familiar environment rather then travel such a distance to be with his newborn cousin which could stress him, let' s be honest.\n\nAS for your sister she is the AH, okay so s\\*\\*\\*t happens in life, I will not be questionning her dating life, however if she struggled with Tyler already, why did she have baby number 4 for eff' s sake? And why wouldn't she let Tyler get a proper diagnosis so she could receive proper and professional help (in some countries they would even provide some caregiver part-time, or at least financial aid to hire one )...", "NTA. This is a fair boundary to set. Everyone else can make their own decisions accordingly and you will get to see where you truly stand with them.", "NTA and, really, seriously consider blocking your sister from now.

I wouldn't.\n\nTell yourself (and anyone who asks or pushes for something that you're not comfortable with): 'Her life problems aren't mine.

Your sister is on her 4th husband at this point, is laid up in her 1st husband's house, and is wondering why he won't take care of another man's kids, which respectfully he shouldn't have to. Also, this seems like your sister \"claimed\" your parents as her own, and left no room for you to have kids and receive help as well. This story is honestly so irritating to me considering the fact that she fixed her face to wish you and your baby death KNOWING that there might be a very strong possibility that it could happen. Please, do us all a favor, tell her to get her shit together, and block her. Your parents need to also step back and look at the entire situation, and realize that they should be helping you.

OP, I would tell your parents that it sounds like they're needed with Tyler more and not to worry about coming until they have more free time. Then, I'd hire a Mother's Helper to help you when your husband is gone.\n\nBut, just so you know, you can see which kid takes priority and it's not you and your kid. I doubt there will EVER be a time when your sister can take care of her own kids.", "[deleted]", "NTA and your sister is disturbed. Who says that? It's appalling behaviour.\n\nBut obviously your parents enable her.\n\nWhat about your mother coming for a shorter stay (say, for a month after the birth) and your father staying home with Tyler?", "Please tell me you told her ill wishes to your parents and blocked your so-called sister.\n\nNTA", "NTA idk how you can still talk to someone who wished death on you and your unborn child, sister or not.", "NTA.\n\n>This sent my mom into crying hysterics & Ashley called leaving dozens of voice/text messages cursing me out, calling me all sorts of horrible names, & telling me she hoped both I & my daughter die during child birth.\n\nSeems that autism runs in the family. Something to watch out for. Possibly not autism, tho. Lack of impulse control. Any your family frequently get in trouble with the law?"]}
