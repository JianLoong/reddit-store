I live in another country 3500 miles from my parents who are retired and are coming to stay with us for 2 weeks before & 3.5 months after the birth to help out because its high risk pregnancy/delivery due to chronic illness & a C-section. My husband travels for work & is gone multiple times a month. \n\nI am the eldest, and this will be my parents first granddaughter but my younger sister Ashley 28f has 4 boys ages: 9, 7, 3,1. Ashley & I are not close and she\u2019s always in a mess. She\u2019s recently divorced from husband #4, has moved back in with ex-husband #1 father of her oldest & he isn\u2019t the nicest guy, especially to the younger boys. \n\nHere\u2019s where the real problems lie, her 3 year old *Tyler is extremely bright but clearly has undiagnosed autism, he\u2019s difficult to handle for my sister, has delayed speech, struggles with behavior and in Ashley\u2019s own words \u201ctoo hard to manage alone\u201d so my parents keep Tyler 3-4 nights a week. Tyler\u2019s father is not in the picture and the only male bonds he has are with my dad & husband. My parents were very excited about coming to stay when my daughter is born until they realized it meant leaving Tyler behind with his mom. \n\nA week ago my mom made a \u201cjoke\u201d about bringing Tyler with and I said I didn\u2019t think this was a good idea, she quickly agreed & changed the subject. Last night my sister sent me a text asking about the logistics of getting Tyler a passport (a requirement to travel to us) so our parents could bring him along. When I told her that I didn\u2019t feel like this was a good idea because it was too short notice to get him a passport, things were going to be stressful & chaotic, & ultimately I said he couldn\u2019t come. \n\nShe BLEW up! Calling me a selfish AH before blocking me (this is typical behavior). My dad then called and said that Ashley told them she would quit her job if they left Tyler behind because there was no possible way she could work & take care of the other boys & Tyler for those 4 months & her ex she\u2019s living with refuses to help with the younger boys especially Tyler. \n\nI told my dad that if that was the case and they weren\u2019t coming unless they brought Tyler that maybe they shouldn\u2019t come, & they could make a trip later on. This sent my mom into crying hysterics & Ashley called leaving dozens of voice/text messages cursing me out, calling me all sorts of horrible names, & telling me she hoped both I & my daughter die during child birth. This went on until my husband made me turn my phone off because I was now extremely upset and physically ill. My concern is that with my own C-section recovery & health issues I already face, having Tyler underfoot with a newborn will just be too much. I adore my nephew but even my parents struggle with him. Now I\u2019m feeling incredibly guilty because everyone is upset. So am I the AH for saying no?", "created_utc": 1687792137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jjvh4/aita_for_telling_my_family_my_nephew_cant_come/", "score": 228, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s your house, your first baby, your comfort level that matters.   She\u2019s abdicated parenting one of her children to your parents and they\u2019d like to be free of that a bit to visit.  This is something that she and your parents need to work out, not you. \n\n[Sidebar: Maybe you should ask your parents to make it a shorter visit without Tyler and think about rotating your in-laws in for some time? I know you probably would rather have your mother the whole time (I get it!) but this could be a good compromise if in-laws are helpful people]\n\nShe wished you would die?  Hold your line.  Better to be without any extra help than deal with all this crap.   Congrats and I hope everything goes great!", "NTA \n\nThere's so much I want to say but no idea where to start...\n\nYour sister shouldn't of kept popping them out if she couldn't handle having that many kids. Shipping a kid off doesn't make them less difficult, getting them help does ... so why hasn't she figured out those means yet? ... calling you selfish is just, I don't even know where to go with that ... \n\nAll in all .. You've said whats needed to be said. Now sit back and focus on you and baby and don't stress for another dang minute over it. Plan for them not coming and plan to send them home if he shows up with them, that would be my fear around having them come at all at this point... I wouldn't trust that they wouldn't just think \"well she can't turn us away if we are there\" ... yes you can! \n\nGood luck!", "Wow. NTA. Your sister is a disaster and I think you should never have contact with her again. Tell your parents not to bring Tyler or else don\u2019t come. Did you tell them what your sister said to you? \n\nDon\u2019t spare another thought about this. Lay the boundaries out and let it go. Congratulations on the new family.", "NTA.

It is your life, your child.   You make the decisions.  Best of luck.", "NTA \n\nThey are coming to help you out. They will not be able to because they will be wrapped up in nephew and his care instead. You will be on your own, except for having to deal with high maintenance toddlers. It will be easier on you to be alone and learn to parent solo rather than deal with that. Tell your parents if they absolutely need to watch him, you understand and will fly out for a visit to them in a few years, but will send a photo instead. And start looking for friend or doula to help you.", "NTA, your family needs help.", "NTA. \n\nI feel for your sister, I have a 2.5 year old with autism, 2 older boys and a baby on the way. It\u2019s a struggle. But she\u2019s been extremely fortunate your parents have been helping out as they have, because not everyone is that lucky to have ANY help. Saying this, she will survive 4 months without your parents there to help. \n\nShe owes you an apology, or your parents need to tell her that it isn\u2019t right she wished death to you and your sister. Honestly if I were your parents I\u2019d stop taking Tyler for a bit just for that comment alone and have her deal with her kids alone. \n\nThe 3 other baby daddies can step in extra for their kids while your parents are out of town so she can focus on her son. \n\nYour only worry needs to be your health, and meeting your daughter. I hope delivery & recovery go smoothly for you.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is annoyed she is loosing free child care for a while and strong arming your parents into letting Tyler come. 100% certified AH there.\n\nHer situation is not great and that's sad, and I feel sorry for her.

Not only that, but young kids tend to carry all kinds of germs and really shouldn't be around a newborn. You have every right to insist that he stays home.\n\nYour sister is a real piece of work. Entitled, selfish and unbelievably rude. She needs to have backup arrangements for her child anyway. What if your parents can't watch him, or need a break?

You sound like a great mom already, prioritizing the well being of your child.  I understand the fear of leaving Ashley alone with her children because she doesn't seem to know how to do that...

Stick to  your boundaries, don't let that negativity into your home!", "NTA\n\nI feel like your mum should visit to help and your father should stay and help with Tyler if they are this torn. That would be a compromise. Now I am not saying this to help your entitled sister AT ALL!! This solution would be the best for you, your daughter and Tyler I think.\n\nIf he is autistic I am pretty sure he would also prefer to stay with familiar person in familiar environment rather then travel such a distance to be with his newborn cousin which could stress him, let' s be honest.\n\nAS for your sister she is the AH, okay so s\\*\\*\\*t happens in life, I will not be questionning her dating life, however if she struggled with Tyler already, why did she have baby number 4 for eff' s sake? And why wouldn't she let Tyler get a proper diagnosis so she could receive proper and professional help (in some countries they would even provide some caregiver part-time, or at least financial aid to hire one )...", "NTA. This is a fair boundary to set. Everyone else can make their own decisions accordingly and you will get to see where you truly stand with them.", "NTA and, really, seriously consider blocking your sister from now.

I wouldn't.\n\nTell yourself (and anyone who asks or pushes for something that you're not comfortable with): 'Her life problems aren't mine.

Your sister is on her 4th husband at this point, is laid up in her 1st husband's house, and is wondering why he won't take care of another man's kids, which respectfully he shouldn't have to. Also, this seems like your sister \"claimed\" your parents as her own, and left no room for you to have kids and receive help as well. This story is honestly so irritating to me considering the fact that she fixed her face to wish you and your baby death KNOWING that there might be a very strong possibility that it could happen. Please, do us all a favor, tell her to get her shit together, and block her. Your parents need to also step back and look at the entire situation, and realize that they should be helping you.

After your sisters nasty comment it would probably be the best thing to do.", "NTA and there\u2019s so much I wanna say so I\u2019m just gonna leave it at go NC with your psycho sister who clearly needs to stop procreating and honestly put it up to your parents. If they really feel the need to stay for Tyler then they should but I know it will suck for them and you\n\nIs there anyway your in laws could stay and help you?", "Wishing for someones baby to die?! From your sister?!! \n\nBig no no! I would keep distance and definitely not let Tyler come over for a a while.  \n\nTaking care of a newborn is a struggle. Your grandparents are not babysitters either, for Tyler or for any of the other boys. \n\nAshely should get the consequences of her actions.", "NTA.  Block these people for now and concentrate on being a good mother.", "NTA they are coming to help you out and keep stress off your plate. Not add to it. Your sister is an asshole and I'm sure that's why she has multiple ex husbands", "Not sure what country you're coming from or going to, but I wanted to add that I am a grandmother of a 17 year-old. 3 years ago when he was 14, I tried to take him from the US to central America for a vacation and was not permitted to do so. He had to have a parent with him. Grandparents are not permitted to just remove a child not theirs from a country.\n\nAs further information, his mother came with us, and had a great deal of paperwork from his father permitting him to travel with only his mother. We were in Belize and I wanted to take him to Guatemala to see if a particular historic site, and was not permitted to do that Without his mother either.\n\nThese grandparents, even if they got a passport, would likely not be able to travel with this child anyway.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, please go no contact with your sister. She said that she hopes you and your baby die? Especially knowing it\u2019s a high risk pregnancy? How absolutely abhorrent.\n\nSecondly, you are going to be recovering from childbirth and adjusting to being a mom. Adding a high needs toddler to the mix is a very big ask and one that you have every right to turn down.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry, this is a very painful situation. Very best of luck with the rest of your pregnancy and birth!", "Of course you are NTA.  Go no contact with your sister and consider whether you really want your parents there for four months.  I highly doubt this will be the last time you hear about this and do you really want to spend four months listening to subtle and not so subtle comments!  With your husband\u2019s support, you will be fine post delivery.  This is too much stress for both of you and you should be enjoying this blessed event!", "NTA. \n\n>Now I\u2019m feeling incredibly guilty because everyone is upset.\n\nLet's clarify something. Everyone is upset because your sister Ashley decided to throw a tantrum rather than be an adult who had four kids and needs to figure it out.", "Try to arrange for a mother's helper or carer to stay with you post-delivery. If your husband travels and you are recovering from a c-section, having someone around could be key.\n\nIt does sound like taking a wild toddler while dealing with a new baby, health issues, and a traveling husband would be too much. In some places, you could at least have a visiting nurse come by regularly.", "Well maybe your sister should look into support services for Tyler. \n\n NTA.", "NTA and if my sister said what yours did, I would never speak to her again. Curious to know how your parents reacted to such a vile comment. If they didn't shut her down hard, they are probably part of the reason sis behaves the way she does.", "NTA- first of all even if you okayed this wild plan of theirs the odds of them getting a passport for this kid before August are slim to none.  Also, depending on the country they're gonna need permission from this child's father to leave the country.  Are they going to be able to get that? Probably not. \n\nIf your parents want to cater to your unstable sisters whims it's better to know that now when there is still time to find some support elsewhere whether that be a close friend or hiring a post partem nurse,  dula or whatnot. I don't know if I could ever get over my parents choosing my sibling over me like that though.", ">Tell your parents not to bring Tyler or else don\u2019t come. \n\nIt's 3500 miles. If her parents show up *with* Tyler anyway, there's very little that can be done about it. To me, that's the bigger worry.", "Girl congrats on that sweet baby. I have my passport. I will come help you instead of all that craziness!  You have my sympathy at all this happening when you need peace the most. I truly hope your parents see wisdom and don\u2019t make a bad decision.", "There is this thing called a hotel, and flights can be changed.", "With your comments, I now see your sister wants the \"glamour\" with zero responsibilities as your husband, parents and you are taking care of her kids.\n\nAlso, your sister might want to have herself evaluated for ADHD and/or Autism, it presents differently in women and she seems to have a few characteristics. Since women are told from a young age to be graceful, be loud, not to run around, and whatnot, we learn at a very young age to mask our ADHD and/or ASD symptoms so as to please society and what it expects from women.\n\nEdit to add: of course NTA", "Your sister is sick and twisted as well as entitled. It\u2019s her job and responsibility to raise her children and provide for them. If your parents choose to stay to look after your nephew (I get that it\u2019s hard work) then they are not giving you or your baby the same care and love. She\u2019s a selfish ah", "NTA. \n\nYour sister is a vile disgusting person who does not need to be a part of your or your immediate family\u2019s life at all. You need to go NC with her & stay that way. Block her for once. \n\nTell your parents that you appreciate the offer for them to come & help with the birth of your daughter & assisting with the transition of becoming a family unit and recovering from a major surgery BUT it would be best if they didn\u2019t come if they need to bring Tyler. Having him there will disrupt everything you\u2019re trying to accomplish.  \n\nTyler being there would not give you the peace you need to heal. He would be a distraction to your parents and they wouldn\u2019t be able to fully support your family and recovery while he is there. \n\nDon\u2019t be rude, just matter of fact. This is about your daughter, your nuclear family & your recovery (both physical & mental). \n\nStay strong! You got this!", "You are NOT THE ASS! If she can\u2019t handle him- why does she think you should have him? She\u2019s his mother- she needs to be a mother and deal with her OWN kid! NTA", "NTA - you need help at a particularly vulnerable time not the presence of a child whose own mother can\u2019t handle him. As for what she said to you - that would be the last thing she ever said to me as i would never allow her to contact me again. How fucking dare she.", "Absolutely NTA. Keep that drama far away from your home", "NTA. And your sister is something saying she hopes you die?! That was way over the top.", "She said she hopes you and the baby die -- she would be dead to me forever.  NTA. if your parents condone this kind of behavior they can be dead to you, too.", "NTA and I don't even see how you can think you are? Your sister wished death upon you and your unborn child. Are you really going to speak to her again? I wouldn't", "NTA. Childbirth and the newborn stage is hard enough.", "Your sister is selfish. And her behaviour with your medical issues is disgraceful.\n\nNTA Give yourself a break from your sister.", "NTA The fact that your own mother has no problems with Ashley saying that she hopes you and your Abby die is childbirth is disgusting. I can\u2019t believe that people would ever think that something like that is an okay thing to say. Hold your ground, don\u2019t let any of them come over.", "Girl heck no you aren't and I'm mad you let your sister and other family members drive you to a point of thinking so. Let me be very clear here. No one and I mean not anyone outside of you, your baby and your husband matter right now. Period. Full stop. If your parents are so concerned about your nephew they can stay home. End of discussion. If your mom can come without your dad for a shorter time she should, if not then they can come later. They have obviously spent your life catering to your sister who manages her life like a WE TV drama series. It might be best that they stay home, they sound stressful as hell. NTA.b", "NTA AT ALL! I can\u2019t believe your sister said that to you, that\u2019s horrible especially because of the high risk of your pregnancy. Please tell your parents what she said and I hope you cut off all contact with her. What she said is unforgivable. Tyler isn\u2019t your problem, you need to put your own health and your baby\u2019s wellbeing first. \n\nAlso why can\u2019t your mom visit you and your dad can stay back and watch Tyler?", "NTA.\n\n>telling me she hoped both I & my daughter die during child birth\n\nThis would be an immediate no-contact for me. There's no coming back from a statement like that.", "NTA. You'd be wise to block your sister and go NC. She sounds awful. You don't need people like that in your life.", "Also your huge ah sister op needs to take responsibility for her own child. NTA don't let your parents come. You will be stressed enough with your own baby.\n\nSad for your parents but it's their decision who they help.", "The op would have far less hassle and more peace if she hired a nurse to help after the birth. Let her parents deal with this feckless woman who can\u2019t even take care of her own son.", "Yeah, I wondered about the possibility of having just her mother come for not quite as long, and then she and OP's father could swap.", "Especially since she is 28, with 4 kids and 4 ex's.", "Refuse without any compromise- the stress and risk to you and your own family is so very much not worth pandering to your sister and mother. You and your baby are your first priority here, and MUST be.", "I hope you\u2019re going to stop enabling the woman who told you she wishes both you and your child die."]}
