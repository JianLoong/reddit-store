They became friends, naturally, and for 10 years I was married to my husband. We had two kids and our marriage fell apart for various reasons, but a catalyst was when my husband began an emotional affair with his secretary. We separated and their relationship was prohibited in the office, so they kept it secret. My brother still works at the same company. My ex asked my brother to his wedding and my brother accepted because they have been friends for a long time. My brother knows my feelings and he responded with \u201cwe\u2019re friends\u201d. My brother is aware of the relationship beginning while I was married to my ex. My brother and I used to be very close but haven\u2019t been for a couple of years prior to the wedding. \nAm I the asshole for asking my brother not to go to my ex husbands wedding?", "created_utc": 1689442427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150hx3t/aita_for_asking_my_brother_not_to_go_to_my_ex/", "score": 327, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your ex did you wrong, that should be a deal breaker for your brother in terms of friendship.  Of course he needs to be civil since they work together, but celebrating his new marriage to the woman he messed around with?! Unacceptable. Your brother sucks.", "NTA for asking. You can ask whatever you like. You just have to accept your brother\u2019s answer, and nothing you\u2019ve said seems to indicate that you threw a tantrum or anything like that when he said he was still going to go.", "NTA- you can absolutely pour your heart out to your brother under these circumstances and him being so close to the situation I thinks it\u2019s fair. However you may not like his answer which is also fair. I think if you asked that if your brother and he attended anyway you have your answer on who close you guys actually are. Damn, GL", "Not sure about the who\u2019s the AH. I\u2019m assuming he thinks it\u2019s a good idea to be friendly with a coworker and his kids uncle. But I\u2019m assuming your kids will be there, so can you reframe it as if he goes then he can watch out for the kids. I know it\u2019s a stretch, but maybe it could help.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, this is better for the relationship subs.\n\nI don't think you're an AH for asking. I do think you staying in contact with your brother after he know about the emotional affair and failed to do anything about it is problematic. Your brother let your marriage fall apart and now he's attending the wedding? Yeah, he wouldn't be a part of my life anymore after that.", "OP, \n\nYour brother is horrible. Your ex is horrible. It sounds like they bonded over being horrible people. They deserve each other. \n\nInvest your energy and time in your children and yourself. I hope you heal and find happiness.", "NTA your brother sucks", "NAH. You're not the ah for asking him not to go, your feelings are perfectly valid. At the same time, while it's kinda wierd, I don't think your brother is an ah either of your ex is a legitimate friend of his, especially since you're not close to your brother anyway and he sees your ex daily. I also have an ex who cheated and I do still talk to his family and maintain a social media relationship with his mom and sisters. One of them attended my next wedding and all of them my next baby shower. My ex and I were very unsuited for one another and we'd have broken up long before we did if we hadn't had a baby and tried to stay together for him.", "NTA. \n\nThere is absolutely no way that I could attend a wedding of my sister ex husband with his AP knowing the hurt they caused my sibling. I would feel completely disloyal to her.\n\nA friendship would not trump my relationship with my sister.\n\nTo be honest I would go very LC with him and have little to do with him if he does. Wish him well you accept his POV even if it hurts you. Then don't discuss it again.", "NTA. From the cradle to the grave. Siblings come before some cheating ex.", "NTA.  By showing up he is supporting your ex that was cheating on you. Since his relationship began while you were married.  I would go NC or low contact with said brother.", "YTA about the wedding. They're friends and coworkers whether he goes to the wedding or not. That's the problem to focus on. The wedding stuff is just pointless drama. What do you win if he doesn't go? Does he suddenly become your ally? No. Does it make him change his mind about being friends with your ex? No. Does it get him a new job? No.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t even have to ask.", "INFO:\n\nI am not clear on the timeline of events from your post. You said your brother was aware of the relationship beginning while you were married. Did he A) know about it as it was happening and didn't tell you, or B) found out about it after it became known to you.", "NTA.  They're friends.  Cool.  Sounds like your bro isn't your friend anymore, time to act accordingly", "NTA it's a bit but understandable ~~ask. Your ex husband wronged you, and if your brother rejected th invitation I don't think it would've strained his friendship if he said he couldn't because it's family~~\n\nwait nevermind I reread it and realized he's marrying the same secretary. Your brother and ex are the AH, sorry you're going through this. You're not crazy or anything for asking", "mild YTA. your feelings are valid but you are asking the uncle of your children not to attend their father's wedding. Right now, it sucks to be you - but big picture wise - you've said your peace and now its time to drop it and remain civil with your children's uncle.", "Yta. It sucks about what happened and no one is asking you to go or for you to be friends with your ex.   I am assuming your children will be going or even other mutual friends.  Your brother needs to make his decision about going. You have told him it would hurt your feeling and that is okay.  He is a grown man so he has to decide what to do.  It is not about making him choose you over your ex/his friend.", "INFO What does an emotional affair mean in this context? Did your husband sleep with his secretary prior to your separation or did he meet someone who made him realize he wasn't happy in his current relationship and wanted out?", "Gentle YTA. The marriage is over. Your brother still has a personal relationship there. You are entitled to have your feelings about it but you really do not have the right to make the demand. (removed my last part after rethinking)", "NAH your feelings are valid and your request that he not go is not an AH thing to request, but your brother has a friendship with your ex apart from you and it's valid for him to want to go to his friend's wedding.", "NTA", "YTA, it is sad that your marriage ended but your brother's friendship is his business and it's unreasonable for you to ask him not to attend. I would be more sympathetic if your ex was abusive towards you but, as unpleasant as it is, emotional affair does not fit into that category.", "Sorry, but yes. You can let him know how you feel, which you have done. But that's about it.\n\nYTA", "I know it hurts and you feel betrayed but honestly if they have a friendship with someone you can\u2019t manage that. Even if it is your ex and your ex cheated.  \n\nYTA. \n\nDon\u2019t hold it against your brother either if he decides to go.  Just make sure he has the decency to not blab on about it adnauseam.", "YTA.\n\nWhy?\n\nYou divorced your unfaithful ex-husband, but you do not have the authority to tell your brother who he can be friends with. \n\nDoes it suck for you that your brother wants to go to the wedding? Sure, but different relationships, different lifes, different choices.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nIt's just disturbing that he prioritizes more his friendship with your ex. This will cause a lot of stress and drama. So, as long as you are still hurting from your previous marriage, it's best to cut contact with him for a while (not permanently).", "NTA to ask, but don\u2019t beg or even offer explanation if he gives pushback. He\u2019s not worth much as a brother all things considering. He knows it\u2019s an asshole move to do, so if he does go, just stop talking to him.", "ESH\n\nBe mad. But your brother has the right to do what he wants. He's still going to be your brother. My brother is kind of a dick too but I wouldn't dream of telling him what to do. \n\nI'm glad that you dumped your ex. He sounds like a dick.", "YTA\n\nYou might not like the fact that your brother is friends with your ex but i think demanding he not attend your ex's wedding would be unreasonable considering that they are workmates and have to work together.", "He's friends with your ex and him going doesn't concern you. No need to cause drama by asking him to not to go when it won't change your life at all. Just don't think about it; it's not like you have to go.", "You can 'ask' anything you want to but if you tell him he can't go or hold it against him for going, YTAH.  You don't control his life or who he's friends with.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is an AH only for mentioning it to you, not for going as long as HE doesn't discuss it with you any further. Sometimes it is best to shoot, shovel and shut up. And you shouldn't ask him or anyone else.\n\nIf someone tells you if he goes, they would be an AH for gossiping since they should know you would be upset.\n\nYou should not expect to control with whom your family and friends associate. This doesn't include _your_ underage children, just the rest of the world.", "NTA, tell people they had an inappropriate work relationship", "And it sounds like he\u2019s getting married to his AP?! NTA.", "[removed]", "Yes to this one!", "I read that as the brother did not know as it was happening (OP mentioned they kept it secret), but does know *now* that they started their relationship while the ex was still married.", "Her brother did not let the marriage fall apart.   The ex is a grown man he was responsible party.", "With all due respect her brother was not responsible for her marriage falling apart. Her ex husband cheated on her, it was his responsibility to respect her and his vows.", "How tf did her brother let his sister marriage fall apart ? He\u2019s not married to them \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11", "Yes. It is possible to maintain relationships with people who hurt other people in your life. To throw someone away because they did something wrong seems high-schoolish to me. You can't be friends with Jane because she insulted my shoes yesterday. Obviously a much different situation, but the principle holds. It depends on the relationship each person has with the others.", "This is a crap response. He was a brother before he was an uncle. OP is asking their brother not to attend the wedding of the ex-husband and his affair partner. The big picture is that the ex-husband is the human equivalent of a poop stain.", "Why would you need to remain civil with a person who clearly doesn't give a shit about what you think or what your feelings are? I'd cut that person off. Family or not, if you don't give a shit about me why would I need you in my life?", "This also means that OP can make the choice to no longer have a relationship with her brother as well. He can see her children on their fathers time as their such good friends.", "Normally means they were sending nudes/ texting things like 'I love you' or 'I'll leave my wife for you soon. Nothing physical but still cheating", "He was abusive. Cheating is emotionally abusive and literally causes trauma. Bro dropped the ball. The least could do is not publicly endorse the relationship.", "Don't hold it against the brother? He knew about the affair, knew it was against company policy, didn't tell his sister, didn't tell HR, and is now going to a public celebration of the ex's relationship. Celebrating the man and woman who hurt and emotionally abused his sister? Yeah, she has that right.", "There\u2019s being a dick and going to the wedding of my friend who cheated on my sister. It wouldn\u2019t even matter if it wasn\u2019t his AP. OP should go LC with the brother.", "How is OP the asshole? This is just sibling etiquette. I really hate this sub sometimes for seeing perfectly reasonable things as unreasonable. It\u2019s not about control. At all. OP\u2019s ex was dead wrong and now the brother is basically condoning the marriage. Like she\u2019s already had to endure the fact that her brother probably regularly hangs out with the AP and her ex. This is really a simple ask. By going, OP\u2019s brother has let her know where she is on the importance totem pole.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I mean, really? You're going to go to an event where you are there to support the people that are the focus of the event and one of those people is someone you know cheated on your sister? OP shouldn't even have to ask.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is an AH only for mentioning it to you, not for going as long as HE doesn't discuss it with you any further.", "So, your sister's husband is starting an inappropriate relationship with his secretary at the place where you both work and you don't tell HR nor tell your sister nor tell the husband to cut it out? Yeah, that's \"letting\" your sister's marriage fail through inaction.", "The principle absolutely does not hold in this situation. Anyone who is a friend of mine wouldn\u2019t purposely hurt my sibling. Because a friend would\u2019ve ended the marriage before starting another one. It is absolutely ok to expect your own sibling to not go to the wedding of your cheating ex. She\u2019s not even asking them to not be friends. Just please don\u2019t go to this wedding. Bare fucking minimum sibling respect.", "Yes! Honestly, this is the path I\u2019d take. I can\u2019t understand family members giving allegiance to cheating Ex\u2019s. If his bond with the dirtbag ex is more important to him than the bond with his sister, then let the ex have him and his sister can move on from both relationships.", "Yeah, that's bro code over basic morality. He should have told the ex off, told his sister, and then outed to HR after the divorce.", "At the end of the day the marriage failed because the husband was a cheating asshole it didn\u2019t fail because of her brother that\u2019s stupid asf to say because if he did tell her the end result would be the same duh !!", "Seriously. In life, you've gotta surround yourself with people who love and care about you and brush those off who don't. Life is so much better when you do. Doesn't matter if they're family or not.", "It doesn't feel like you're paying attention to the words I'm using. Either that, or I'm not using the right words to convey my thoughts on the matter.\n\nOP wasn't even afforded an opportunity to fight for her marriage in part because of her brother's inaction. He knew the affair was starting and did nothing. He didn't tell his sister (someone that he was supposedly close to) so that she would have an opportunity to confront the husband. He didn't tell the husband to stop doing something that was going to hurt his sister in the end. And he didn't go to HR about someone in the company violating what is a pretty standard company policy anywhere you go (supervisors cannot have relations with subordinates). No, he sat back and ignored it all and let it happen.\n\nAnd now, that same person that couldn't be bothered to take action earlier is going to actively do something to hurt her again? Yeah, don't worry about whether or not the brother is going to the wedding because it's time to stop considering the brother \"family\".", "10000% this! Life is too short and hard enough as it is! Surround yourself with as much love and support as possible!", "We don't know if he ever said anything to the ex."]}
