I had to dip into my savings to survive. When I was on my last leg, a childhood friend, James(29M) reached out, and offered me a place to stay. He's now the richest person I know personally. As it turned out he also had a job opportunity for me. The terms were very generous. When I was 18, I helped him out a little, and he said this was his opportunity to repay me.\n\nI met him while working in his father's hotel. Unfortunately, they lost it. So, James bought a small luxury hotel, and he hired me as General Manager. I also get a small cut of the profits. I was grateful for the job, and felt guilty about the additional benefit, but he insisted on it. He is not interested in running the place, and he wanted some one he could trust. So, I pretty much have the final say in any matter. \n\nWe hired an AM to help me run the place. Bella(30'sF) is more experienced than me, but she had to settle for the AM position. This is the reason for providing the background. If we go by seniority she should be the GM and I should be the AM. Apart form the occasional haughty attitude, I don't have much trouble from her.\n\nA couple of days ago, a family checked in. 2 adults and 2 children. They were loud and rude. When a bellhop stumbled they freaking laughed at him, and scolded him for dropping their luggage. So, not a good first impression.\n\nMeanwhile, two couples (1 white and 1 Indian(?)), who were clearly on vacation together and waiting to check in, helped the staff out before we could. The family was rude to them too.\n\nYesterday, I got a call from my AM asking if she could upgrade someone to our gold suite. We have 5 suites. I always keep our best one in reserve for James or his friends, and if there is a vacancy in any of the other four, we sometimes freely upgrade when someone asks. Only I can do it.\n\nWhen I got to the reception, it was the husband asking for an upgrade. When my AM is speaking to me I could see the rest of the staff were uncomfortable. Fortunately, I saw the two couples from before coming back for the day. So, I told the husband I already upgraded someone else, and politely excused myself and talked to the couples in private and offered them the upgrade. \n\nTwo reasons for that. First. the couples are staying for 2 more nights while the family is staying for 5 more. Second, their attitude.\n\nLater, when my AM came to know of it she confronted me. She said she already promised them the upgrade, and I embarrassed her. She demanded me to upgrade the family to our best suite as compensation. I said no and politely pointed out only I have the power to upgrade when it came to the suites.\n\nShe started blabbering about experience and how I am ruining the hotel's reputation and called me an asshole. She tried to complain to James, but after a quick phone call with me he brushed her off.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679926290, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123o131/aita_for_not_upgrading_a_family_and_embarrassing/", "score": 332, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Document this discussion and put it in her personnel file to show that you don't want this happening again.  YOU make that decision, not her.  Start acting like the General Manager you are.  The background information is irrelevant.  You = GM, they = AM.  Also, be ready to replace her.  Start interviewing an additional check in person.

So i do know what's she is doing. \n\nShe is trying to get a hard costumer to praise her and bad mouth you to take your position.\n\nThis will be a pattern of behaviour if you don't stop it.\n\nAny one who read a book on costumer service knows that you don't reward bad behaviour. If you do you loos good costumer , experienced work force. And you end up loosing valuable assets and true reports because only a few people will stay in your business.", "NTA\n\nShe had no right to promise them the upgrade and why should you reward bad behaviour (her and the family) instead of polite people?", "NTA.  She knew she didn't have the authority to make that promise.  You didn't embarrass her, she embarrassed herself.  Good on you for upgrading who you did and not rewarding the family's shitty behavior.  Sounds like you even gave her the 'out' of saying \"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize the last upgrade was already issued.\"", "upgrading rude people? why?????", "Of course you are not the asshole.  You are the boss and you better keep that clear as air to you\u2019re AM. She was hired as the AM and she just tried to usurp your authority.

As the General Manager, it is your responsibility to make decisions that are in the best interest of the hotel and its guests. In this case, it was clear that the family was rude and unpleasant, while the other guests were kind and considerate. You made a decision based on that information, and it was the right one.\r  \n\r  \nIt is not appropriate for the Assistant Manager to make promises like that without consulting you first. It's important to have a chain of command in place, and it's your job to ensure that everyone is following it.\r  \n\r  \nIt's also worth noting that your AM's reaction was unprofessional and uncalled for. As a member of the team, she should be willing to work with you to make the hotel a success. If she continues to challenge your decisions or undermine your authority, it may be necessary to have a conversation with her about her behavior.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t allow your insecurity about her experience question your judgement.

You don\u2019t reward people who have mistreated your staff.", "NTA\n\nYou acted perfectly!\n\nFirst of all, never upgrade someone who behaves like an AH.  You said this family berated others, and was rude to other guests.  No upgrade for them! \n\nNext, the AM may be older and more experienced, that means she is gunning for your job.  She is looking for reasons to go to the owner about you.  She is NOT your friend, she is your employee.\n\nThe other reason you gave, 2 nights vs 5 nights is perfect.  Why give away  3 extra nights in your better room?  Particularly to someone who has been rude to staff and guests for no reason? \n\nYou need to document this instance of insubordination of the AM, in writing.  How she promised what she had no reason to promise, and went over your head for no reason, then complained.  It is a strike.  She pulls stuff like this too frequently and you\u2019ll see the pattern.", "NTA. Bella wants your job and is attempting to assert dominance", "NTA. If she saw what they did and still thought they should be rewarded, maybe she shouldn\u2019t be working hospitality.", "NTA. You were in a tough position and you handled it perfectly. It's understandable that you wanted to reward the couples for their kind act and it's clear that the family was not deserving of an upgrade. Plus, you had a valid reason to refuse your AM's request as you are the only one who can upgrade the suite. You did the right thing.", "You are a GM now . Your crew rely on you.

What she thinks about that doesn\u2019t matter at all, and your actions show he made a good choice.

She\u2019s got a \u2018character\u2019 issue. She\u2019s arrogant and haughty, bolstered because of her experience and you can\u2019t generally have one sit down come-to-Jesus-talk with someone and they change their fundamental character over it.\n\nI\u2019d recommend one conversation where you give a final acknowledgement that she may have more experience than you but at the end of the day, you are the GM. \n\nShe either gets on board with following your lead and *never* tries to argue your lack of experience with her or she needs to find another position.\n\nThe way you handled it shows you don\u2019t actually trust her because when she requested to upgrade them, if you trusted her you\u2019d have mentioned straight out, \u201cNo, they can\u2019t have an upgrade,\u201d and if you\u2019d respected her at all you might have thrown in, \u201cdue to their poor treatment of the staff and other guests.\u201d\n\nBut you didn\u2019t do that. You made up a lie to her to say \u2018no\u2019 (you\u2019re the GM why the hell would you have to lie to her?) and then ran over to another couple to offer the upgrade so you weren\u2019t technically lying. Subterfuge worthy of r/pettyrevenge and high school but was beneath you.\n\nI\u2019m really not trying to criticize you here. You need to find a way to get over your imposter syndrome, embrace that you\u2019re worthy of your responsibilities and and lean into your role at your work.\n\nI\u2019d fire this AM and hire a more humble and experienced one.\n\nYou may find the archives at [Ask A Manager](https://www.askamanager.org/) to be helpful for you to really lean into your responsibilities.", "NTA. Your AM promised something that was not in their power to give. That's on them, not you.", "Nta. Get rid of her.", "NTA, she clearly overstepped her authority by making the promise with the family. That is YOUR authority and you need to speak to her regarding that.", "Let go of your insecurities about the job. If you\u2019d felt more confident, you\u2019d have told the AM \u201cI did nothing to embarrass you. You embarrassed yourself by promising something you didn\u2019t have the ability to give.  For future reference, we don\u2019t reward bad behavior here.  That applies to guests who mistreat staff, as well as to the AM\u2019s who try to reward them.\u201d\n\nYou still need to circle back and let her know her escalation to the owner of an issue caused by her bad decision reflects poorly on her. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nWhy did she promise an upgrade that she was not in a capacity to grant? It sounds like she is the one hurting the hotel's reputation by making promises that she cannot back up, not you. I would probably leave a note in her personnel file, including the detail that she wanted to upgrade someone up for five nights (much more costly) rather than two as well as the fact that she seemed willing to reward the rudeness of customers despite obvious discomfort in the staff.\n\nAlso, it sounds like she's trying to orchestrate ways to make you seem less competent than you are. I would get every incident of her doing as such in writing with dates attached - hell, even attach these notes in emails to James in regards to your concerns. If you do this - I would make this practice universal whenever you have to do any write-ups so it doesn't seem targeted.\n\nLast but not least - don't sweat that you have less experience. You got the gig. I'm guessing there's a reason she has issues actually getting an actual GM role somewhere - probably due to mistreatment of staff (like not caring if they are treated poorly by guests) or due to her general attitude if this behavior is anything to go by.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
