I had to dip into my savings to survive. When I was on my last leg, a childhood friend, James(29M) reached out, and offered me a place to stay. He's now the richest person I know personally. As it turned out he also had a job opportunity for me. The terms were very generous. When I was 18, I helped him out a little, and he said this was his opportunity to repay me.\n\nI met him while working in his father's hotel. Unfortunately, they lost it. So, James bought a small luxury hotel, and he hired me as General Manager. I also get a small cut of the profits. I was grateful for the job, and felt guilty about the additional benefit, but he insisted on it. He is not interested in running the place, and he wanted some one he could trust. So, I pretty much have the final say in any matter.\n\nWe hired an AM to help me run the place. Bella(30'sF) is more experienced than me, but she had to settle for the AM position. This is the reason for providing the background. If we go by seniority she should be the GM and I should be the AM. Apart form the occasional haughty attitude, I don't have much trouble from her.\n\nA couple of days ago, a family checked in. 2 adults and 2 children. They were loud and rude. When a bellhop stumbled they freaking laughed at him, and scolded him for dropping their luggage. So, not a good first impression.\n\nMeanwhile, two couples (1 white and 1 Indian(?)), who were clearly on vacation together and waiting to check in, helped the staff out before we could. The family was rude to them too.\n\nYesterday, I got a call from my AM asking if she could upgrade someone to our gold suite. We have 5 suites. I always keep our best one in reserve for James or his friends, and if there is a vacancy in any of the other four, we sometimes freely upgrade when someone asks. Only I can do it.\n\nWhen I got to the reception, it was the husband asking for an upgrade. When my AM is speaking to me I could see the rest of the staff were uncomfortable. Fortunately, I saw the two couples from before coming back for the day. So, I told the husband I already upgraded someone else, and politely excused myself and talked to the couples in private and offered them the upgrade.\n\nTwo reasons for that. First. the couples are staying for 2 more nights while the family is staying for 5 more. Second, their attitude.\n\nLater, when my AM came to know of it she confronted me. She said she already promised them the upgrade, and I embarrassed her. She demanded me to upgrade the family to our best suite as compensation. I said no and politely pointed out only I have the power to upgrade when it came to the suites.\n\nShe started blabbering about experience and how I am ruining the hotel's reputation and called me an asshole. She tried to complain to James, but after a quick phone call with me he brushed her off.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n**Edit 1:** A little update. Sorry for not replying to comments/messages, but this is a bigger mess than I imagined.\n\nIf there are rooms available, any of my staff can ask for my approval to upgrade a guest. I rarely deny them. They generally have good reason for asking. I encourage this because it makes my staff feel appreciated, and they are the ones who knows more about the guests than me as they interact with them more than me. I need to deal with a lot of things like suppliers etc.\n\nAs for the AM gunning my position, she is barking up the wrong tree. I own part(10%) of the hotel. I didn't ask for it, but James did it anyway. So, screwing me over is impossible unless I massively screw up.\n\nI realized I didn't give the reason my AM gave me (word count limit). Apparently, the guests complained about the services and also about noise during the night. That was why she wanted to upgrade them to prove we are the best. That explanation didn't sit well with me. So, I asked my staff why they were uncomfortable.\n\nEvery receptionist, floor manager etc. gets some leeway when dealing with guests. Within limit they can give discounts or free meals. They don't need approval for little things. As you can guess, higher the position higher the limit. From what I gathered, this family is always complaining, and kept asking to speak to manager. My AM kept giving them free meals etc. but instead of using her code she is ordering the staff member who bought the problem to her to use their code.\n\nAs for why I didn't know about this, my AM should be the one informing me about these problems. So, I will probably let her go, and promote one of the good ones. I still don't know what is going on with this particular family and my AM.", "created_utc": 1679926290, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123o131/aita_for_not_upgrading_a_family_and_embarrassing/", "score": 1936, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would get every incident of her doing as such in writing with dates attached - hell, even attach these notes in emails to James in regards to your concerns.

You got the gig.
