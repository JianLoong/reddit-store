I donated everything we don't wear, and have folded and put away everything that we won't need during winter. Some of this clothing has gone into a suitcase, which is currently sitting on our bedroom floor because it is too heavy for me to lift and put away. I have asked my husband to please help me more than once, but he is always either too tired after finishing work or he says that it slips his mind. All in all, the suitcase is currently looking like a permanent installation in our bedroom. He has at least shifted it out of the main walkway in the interim.\n\nLast night, I woke up to go to the bathroom and ended up tripping over the suitcase as I fumbled in the dark. I do obviously know where it is after it has been there for so long, but I was half asleep and trying to avoid our sleeping pup. While the fall wasn't bad, I did wake my husband in the process.\n\nMy husband was initially quite worried - especially since our midwife told us any fall needed a trip to the hospital - but once he realised it was because of the suitcase, he became quite upset. He said that there is no way I could have tripped over the suitcase unintentionally as he has moved it out of the walkway, and I had done it to \"prove a point\". He said that he could not believe I would behave so passive-aggressively and put our baby's life at risk rather than just asking him again, and that forgetting to move the case is not a crime.\n\nThe more I tried to explain that I was trying to avoid waking him and tripping over the dog, the more he said that these were just convenient excuses to make him look lazy and unhelpful around the house. He said I was punishing him for not getting to the suitcase sooner, and that if anything, I should have had a plan to deal with it from the beginning as it was me who had wanted to sort out the closet in the first place.\n\nMy husband was fired up again after I mentioned to the midwife this morning that I had tripped over a suitcase, and he said I could have just told her that I had fallen over the dog or my shoelaces. He said that he had made his feelings clear during the night when we had our discussion, and I was rubbing salt in the wounds now. I spoke to my mom (F61) about it after we got back from the midwife because I wanted to vent, and she surprisingly took his side and said I was letting my emotions get the best of me.\n\nMy mom said I should have been more graceful bringing it up in front of the midwife (although I will say that I never said anything about asking him to move it), and she said that the situation has probably made my husband feel quite bad about himself which is why it has turned into such a \"big drama\".

Not only did it not disturb my ex but also helped me get back to sleep faster. And I felt I needed all the sleep I could get! (Never enough btw...)

Stick up for yourself. \u201cHusband, I did not fall on purpose. You and I both know that. You feel badly that I or the baby could have been hurt, and can\u2019t be adult enough to accept your responsibility. I will make this point once and make it very clear. This is **YOUR** fault.

Your husband should have helped you move it.   \n\n\nI think both of you have had a role in what has transpired here.  \nYou, the wife, asked for help multiple times with a heavy suitcase, and your husband chose not to take your request seriously. He cited tiredness and forgetfulness, which, quite frankly, is no excuse when safety is at stake.  \nHowever, you, on the other hand, knew about the suitcase and its placement but did not address it effectively or find an alternative solution, especially considering the pregnancy. You both share responsibility for ensuring a safe living space.  \nNow, as for your husband's response, accusing you of being passive-aggressive and attributing motives to your actions without reasonable cause isn't helpful or respectful. That said, your manner of bringing up the situation to the midwife might have been more considerate.  \nIn this case, it's a shared responsibility, and you both need to work on better communication and cooperation. You're soon to be parents, and your primary focus should be on creating a safe and nurturing environment for your child.", "YTA,  because you already admitted to making it a set up to make your point.  You are in full nesting mode and hormonal.  There were other solutions to the problem.  You could have emptied the suitcase and found smaller containers that you could handle to put the stuff away.  You could have taken your husband by the hand (yes sometimes it is necessary) and asked him to put it away,  now please.   But why did you have to risk injuring or losing your child to make a point?

If that is your reason for not moving the suitcase, why didn't you tell me that when I asked you to put it away? Why didn't you tell me that I should ask someone else because you don't feel you should have to?*\n4. *I confess! My plan was to simply ask you to put the suitcase away. I assumed it was something reasonable to ask of you. Please explain why you find it so unreasonable.*\n5. *Is there any other reason or limitation preventing you from putting that suitcase away? Or is that it - you resented my asking you, didn't want to do it, and failed to say any of that over the past month?*\n\n* *I tripped over the suitcase in the night.

You think it's more likely I intentionally got out of bed, walked over to the suitcase, and pretended to trip and fall - rather than any of those other things combining to make me trip.*\n3. *You think it is in my nature to (1) want to make you look bad and punish you, (2) conceive of a plot to do that, (3) to not care that it might harm the baby I am carrying - all that, rather than simply tell you I've got a problem with you not putting up the suitcase. You want me to be your partner in life, but you think that poorly of me.*\n4. *I have clearly expressed my desire for you to put up the suitcase. I have never made a secret of the fact that I wanted you to do that - only because I simply cannot. You believe that you not doing it for a month upsets me enough to hatch a devious and dangerous plot. You assume I care that much about the suitcase being put up, but you still refuse to put it away.

You see everything about this as you being the victim. I tripped and fell to hurt you. I didn't lie about the object I tripped over to hurt you.

I'm not ADHD, but I've seen friends talk about it enough to know that ADHD can have outcomes like this. Also, my partner and I each have plenty of house tasks that have been lingering longer than 3 weeks. Though most of them would take more than the 2 minutes of this task.\n\nHowever ... OP's husband responded like shit to what happened, and that is a huge red flag. \n\nOP, you are clearly NTA, but I am concerned about the interactions you're describing in this post. Has your husband treated you this way before? Probably the best possible outcome here is that he's stressed about impending child & being an ass, and he recognizes that promptly and apologizes appropriately. But if he has a habit of this behavior ... I am concerned about your well-being & that of your child.", "They could, actually, and that's fault.

For example, the way I approach a 60yo Army vet with PTSD is usually very different than the way I approach a 19yo college student with social anxiety. And the example I gave in my original comment is merely one way (out of *hundreds*) that defenses can be handled.\n\nOne thing I remember learning is that people in general seem to get defensive when you include the word \u201cwhy\u201d in your question. So instead of saying something like \u201cwhy would you say that?\u201d I\u2019ll ask them \u201cwhat led you to say that?\u201d It\u2019s the same question but I get totally different responses when I use the latter phrasing, because it doesn\u2019t activate as many defenses.", "Quick, fill up another suitcase so you can shit on your husband with a bunch of internet randoms.

If I could scream to my pregnant self, and every young and/or to-be mother, I\u2019d say: YOU ARE WORKING TOO. EVERY mom is a working mom. And you\u2019re likely working harder.

You should only donate things in good working order.", "As a fellow European, I really don't feel like couple and marriage dynamics were influenced by the US. Or at least very little. I can't speak of every European country of course, but I feel like old British puritans influenced the marriage culture in the US much more than the other way around.\n\nMost European countries existed in one form of another for thousand of years before the US was even a thing. That culture wasn't just erased because of the growing US influence during and particularly post Cold War.\n\nAnd again not to speak for every European country, but taking France as an example, up until 2005 to 2010, while you had American movies and TV shows that were broadcast on TV, they were always dubbed, and even then, the vast majority of programs were still French.\n\nSame for politics as showcased by the fact that pretty much every major European country has a strong socialist party.", "Did you not read she\u2019s pregnant and can\u2019t lift the suitcase?

He can\u2019t be fucked to put away a suitcase for weeks because he\u2019s too tired after work, the fuck is he going to do once a baby is there?", "Married single mom on the way.", "Not just that, but if he's too tired to take 30 seconds to move a suitcase, what's he going to do when baby is crying?
