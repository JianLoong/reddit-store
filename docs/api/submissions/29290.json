{"id": 29290, "submission_id": "17c8h01", "title": "AITA for \"purposefully\" tripping over a suitcase and guilt tripping my husband?", "selftext": "I (F32) am currently eight months pregnant with our first, and I am trying to do everything I can to make sure the house is ready. This started with little spring cleaning jobs, but has developed into a full blown deep clean of everything.\n\nOne of the things I have decluttered recently was mine and my husband's (M33) closet. I donated everything we don't wear, and have folded and put away everything that we won't need during winter. Some of this clothing has gone into a suitcase, which is currently sitting on our bedroom floor because it is too heavy for me to lift and put away. I have asked my husband to please help me more than once, but he is always either too tired after finishing work or he says that it slips his mind. All in all, the suitcase is currently looking like a permanent installation in our bedroom. He has at least shifted it out of the main walkway in the interim.\n\nLast night, I woke up to go to the bathroom and ended up tripping over the suitcase as I fumbled in the dark. I do obviously know where it is after it has been there for so long, but I was half asleep and trying to avoid our sleeping pup. While the fall wasn't bad, I did wake my husband in the process.\n\nMy husband was initially quite worried - especially since our midwife told us any fall needed a trip to the hospital - but once he realised it was because of the suitcase, he became quite upset. He said that there is no way I could have tripped over the suitcase unintentionally as he has moved it out of the walkway, and I had done it to \"prove a point\". He said that he could not believe I would behave so passive-aggressively and put our baby's life at risk rather than just asking him again, and that forgetting to move the case is not a crime.\n\nThe more I tried to explain that I was trying to avoid waking him and tripping over the dog, the more he said that these were just convenient excuses to make him look lazy and unhelpful around the house. He said I was punishing him for not getting to the suitcase sooner, and that if anything, I should have had a plan to deal with it from the beginning as it was me who had wanted to sort out the closet in the first place.\n\nMy husband was fired up again after I mentioned to the midwife this morning that I had tripped over a suitcase, and he said I could have just told her that I had fallen over the dog or my shoelaces. He said that he had made his feelings clear during the night when we had our discussion, and I was rubbing salt in the wounds now. I spoke to my mom (F61) about it after we got back from the midwife because I wanted to vent, and she surprisingly took his side and said I was letting my emotions get the best of me.\n\nMy mom said I should have been more graceful bringing it up in front of the midwife (although I will say that I never said anything about asking him to move it), and she said that the situation has probably made my husband feel quite bad about himself which is why it has turned into such a \"big drama\".

Please, stop considering the fragile feelings of a grown-ass husband.   \nIt is essentially his fault that you tripped over the suitcase, since it was his job to have it removed. If you tripped over the dog or shoelaces (who is even wearing shoes with laces at night), you would be just saying that. If he wants you to not say that, he might just move the suitcase. As easy as that.   \n\n\nYour husband is AH, not you.", "Certainly NTA. Doesn't matter if something has been there one day or thirty years, in the middle of the night it's still possible to make a wrong step in the wrong direction as the dark tends to disorientate you.\n\nExample: When I was pregnant I used to get up in the dark when I needed the bathroom. Not only did it not disturb my ex but also helped me get back to sleep faster. And I felt I needed all the sleep I could get! (Never enough btw...)

The only reason your trip on the suitcase is making your husband look lazy and unhelpful is because he is being lazy and unhelpful.", "I feel like this is worse than it seems. His feelings are hurt because his lazyness ended up possibly hurting you and your baby? And he does not listen to what you tell him about the fall?

I've had bullies that treated me better than that when they actually hurt me, lol.\n\nYour husband is projecting the blame, and honestly this is my main problem here.

You absolutely DO NOT LIE about how you got an injury, especially if its due to negligent actions by your husband. He's blaming you for his lazy behavior, it sounds like it's just one suitcase and all he had to do is put it away, probably a job that will take less than 10 minutes. Your mother is not being helpful at all,  she is excusing his behavior.

Both of which apparently get my point across quickly because my SO hates it and no longer stalls on the simplest of tasks. ESPECIALLY when I was pregnant. \n\nIt\u2019s a damn suitcase. It should take all of two minutes for him to lift into the closet or attic or wherever. Now, if you were to lift it because he\u2019s ignoring/stalling and something were to happen and you go into labor or whatever, he\u2019d still try to make you look like the ass\u2026 \n\nYou have a SO problem.

So, your husband is lazy and is now embarrassed that you fell and could have hurt the baby. He\u2019s too damned emotionally immature to accept responsibility. \n\nPlease, OP. Stick up for yourself. \u201cHusband, I did not fall on purpose. You and I both know that. You feel badly that I or the baby could have been hurt, and can\u2019t be adult enough to accept your responsibility. I will make this point once and make it very clear. This is **YOUR** fault. I expect and apology. You have had your one get out of jail free card. This behaviour won\u2019t happen again and we are not discussing this again.

Your husband should have helped you move it.   \n\n\nI think both of you have had a role in what has transpired here.  \nYou, the wife, asked for help multiple times with a heavy suitcase, and your husband chose not to take your request seriously. He cited tiredness and forgetfulness, which, quite frankly, is no excuse when safety is at stake.  \nHowever, you, on the other hand, knew about the suitcase and its placement but did not address it effectively or find an alternative solution, especially considering the pregnancy. You both share responsibility for ensuring a safe living space.  \nNow, as for your husband's response, accusing you of being passive-aggressive and attributing motives to your actions without reasonable cause isn't helpful or respectful. That said, your manner of bringing up the situation to the midwife might have been more considerate.  \nIn this case, it's a shared responsibility, and you both need to work on better communication and cooperation. You're soon to be parents, and your primary focus should be on creating a safe and nurturing environment for your child.", "YTA,  because you already admitted to making it a set up to make your point.  You are in full nesting mode and hormonal.  There were other solutions to the problem.  You could have emptied the suitcase and found smaller containers that you could handle to put the stuff away.  You could have taken your husband by the hand (yes sometimes it is necessary) and asked him to put it away,  now please.   But why did you have to risk injuring or losing your child to make a point?
