You\u2019ve already tried the \u201cnice\u201d approach by letting her know, cleaning it yourself (WAY nicer than is warranted, IMO) and even bringing a light to show her, which, again, is a much nicer approach than I\u2019d be capable of. \n\nThis is your workplace.

I would have taken a video of the dog barking and growling at you and put a complaint in over that alone. The dog peeing inside is just revolting. Your manager is a spineless AH who shouldn't have his job because he is too concerned with everyone liking him to actually do it. It is not on OP to complain, the manager should have banned her dog without OP needing to say anything. It doesn't need explaining why Mary is a gross mega AH.

Just no.", "Report her and her dog to human resources as a hinderace to you and obstacle to maneuver around while he barks and growls at you.The dog is creating an unsafe and hostile work environment. And then during your meeting with HR, then tell them all about the peeing all-over marking his territory. That's when you tell them all about being asked to show where the dog had sprayed. And how you helpfully brought in your personal no doggie peepee spray  as well as the black light. And tell them all about her mocking you for doing as she asked by pointing out where he sprays, the horrible smell she says only you can smell, and how she iis intimidating your coworkers to agree with her that you are making up odors. Once you report her for making a hostile work environment and let the rest about the unsanitary pee slip she cannot blame you. You have asked her not bring the dog to work. Good luck!
