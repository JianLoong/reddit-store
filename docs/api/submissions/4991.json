{"id": 4991, "submission_id": "zokwuw", "title": "AITA for telling my friend his physical standards are why he\u2019s single?", "selftext": "I (22M) have a friend (22M) who has never had a girlfriend or romantic experience. Now, let me say that I actually really like him as a person and think he has positive qualities. He has a solid job making $180k with a company car as a surgical device sales rep (at 22!) after graduating magna cum laude. He is generally affable and easy to talk to. If his standards were just educated and good person I would totally support it as I think that\u2019s reasonable. However, physically, and I know I\u2019m being brutal here, he is not a catch. He already has a significantly receded hairline, his face is quite frankly below average, he\u2019s of below average height and he\u2019s not in amazing shape. I believe he has a distorted view because his parents constantly told him he was very handsome and could get any girl. As a result, he is exclusively interested in women who are not just successful, but also are exceptionally gorgeous. \n\nA woman, who said she just graduated from an ivy league and was a tech sales rep, was flirting with him at the bar. Though she was nice and clearly quite intelligent, and again I know I\u2019m being brutal here, she was not very attractive. When she asked for his number, he politely declined. I asked him what was wrong and he said \u201cI mean she seems like a nice person but she\u2019s definitely not in my league\u201d. I bit my tongue. The next week, he came to me upset and told me that a woman that he had a cooking class with rejected him. Suspecting the reason why, I asked him to show me a picture of her from her social media. Sure enough, she was insanely attractive and in marketing at a big company. I just tried to sympathize. Later, I thought long and hard about it. On the one hand, I didn\u2019t want to be mean. But on the other, this has been occurring since freshman year of high school. He is now the last person in the friend group to be single and completely missed out on dating in high school and college. Say what you will, but I think that romance is important for the vast majority of people, and I also think physical attraction is a foundational aspect of relationships unless you\u2019re both ace. He could easily be in a relationship if he got over his obsession with beauty. \n\nSo after rehearsing what I wanted to say, I decided to sit him down and I told him \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you man, I think you should lower your physical standards. You would have way more options\u201d. He protested and said that his standards were reasonable because he\u2019s a good looking guy. I said \u201cI hate to say it, but your approach of only going after beautiful and successful women has not worked out. Feel free to shoot your shot but I think you should also consider women that are nice/smart but less physically attractive\u201d. I recommended he go to therapy about this. He got angry and has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since (8 days).

She's 5'0 and roughly spherical, and while she has a nice smile she's not going to excite the male gaze and she KNOWS this.\n\nBut. She also knows she'd be much, much less happy settling for a dude who really isn't good enough than she is right now, a single home-owner with 3 cats.\n\nI'm happier with my life than I would be with hers, but I honestly admire her for seeing reality for what it is and making her choices. She says she won't settle for a man less attractive than George Clooney, but she doesn't get angry at the universe for not giving her a hot man. She's just living her life, being happily single.\n\ntl;dr Sometimes women (people?) are just happy single, and don't need to be told their standards are too high", "Aro= Aromantic: a person who does not feel romantic feelings towards others\n\nAce= Asexual: a person who does not feel sexual feelings towards other\n\n[google is right there](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=aroace)", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
