{"id": 4991, "submission_id": "zokwuw", "title": "AITA for telling my friend his physical standards are why he\u2019s single?", "selftext": "I (22M) have a friend (22M) who has never had a girlfriend or romantic experience. Now, let me say that I actually really like him as a person and think he has positive qualities. He has a solid job making $180k with a company car as a surgical device sales rep (at 22!) after graduating magna cum laude. He is generally affable and easy to talk to. If his standards were just educated and good person I would totally support it as I think that\u2019s reasonable. However, physically, and I know I\u2019m being brutal here, he is not a catch. He already has a significantly receded hairline, his face is quite frankly below average, he\u2019s of below average height and he\u2019s not in amazing shape. I believe he has a distorted view because his parents constantly told him he was very handsome and could get any girl. As a result, he is exclusively interested in women who are not just successful, but also are exceptionally gorgeous. \n\nA woman, who said she just graduated from an ivy league and was a tech sales rep, was flirting with him at the bar. Though she was nice and clearly quite intelligent, and again I know I\u2019m being brutal here, she was not very attractive. When she asked for his number, he politely declined. I asked him what was wrong and he said \u201cI mean she seems like a nice person but she\u2019s definitely not in my league\u201d. I bit my tongue. The next week, he came to me upset and told me that a woman that he had a cooking class with rejected him. Suspecting the reason why, I asked him to show me a picture of her from her social media. Sure enough, she was insanely attractive and in marketing at a big company. I just tried to sympathize. Later, I thought long and hard about it. On the one hand, I didn\u2019t want to be mean. But on the other, this has been occurring since freshman year of high school. He is now the last person in the friend group to be single and completely missed out on dating in high school and college. Say what you will, but I think that romance is important for the vast majority of people, and I also think physical attraction is a foundational aspect of relationships unless you\u2019re both ace. He could easily be in a relationship if he got over his obsession with beauty. \n\nSo after rehearsing what I wanted to say, I decided to sit him down and I told him \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you man, I think you should lower your physical standards. You would have way more options\u201d. He protested and said that his standards were reasonable because he\u2019s a good looking guy. I said \u201cI hate to say it, but your approach of only going after beautiful and successful women has not worked out. Feel free to shoot your shot but I think you should also consider women that are nice/smart but less physically attractive\u201d. I recommended he go to therapy about this. He got angry and has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since (8 days).

Even on this sub. So I dunno who hurt you, but you\u2019re way off on this one.", "No I would not say that. I wouldn\u2019t say anything about her own physical appearance and neither did the OP. He said something like \u201cyou would have way more options if you would lower your physical standards.\u201d I would say that to a man or a woman in this situation. There\u2019s no need to get personal at all.", "What double standards? The one you made up in your head? \n\nIf a woman with a receding hairline and a face like mashed potato\u2019s was only going to Calvin Klein level men - I would absolutely tell her to lower her standards.", "He\u2019s also a talented musician, and a very personable lad from when I\u2019ve seen him interviewed.", "You know what yeah there are woman who use that logic to demand getting those giga chads!! Doesn't mean it works tho lol", "They can't fall off because the oceans are held in by the Antarctic ice wall, obviously. I'm not sure what happens when global warming makes the ice wall melt, but it's probably not gonna be a great time.", "If he doesnt want to go after \"ugly chicks\" then he can stay alone until he's rich enough to get himself a hot gold digger.", "Yes, lots of men are very angry to find out that all women aren\u2019t vending machines that you put the right amount of money into to have them suddenly be attractive to you!", "I was extremely attractive in my youth. I no longer am, and am okay with that. I had twice in the last 10 years when men acted like I was somehow flirting with them when I wasn't. It was kind of bizarre. Once was at a park when our kids were playing, and we were making small talk, the other was when I recognized a neighbor from a building that I moved into a week before. Some men genuinely think that they are 'all that' when it comes to a high income, no matter how 'meh' they are.", "But that's not totally false. Man who make money can have more attractive woman... But those man don't look at woman who are just as successful as them and who make lot of money, can then there is an imbalance again", "He is, if he's smart enough for a girl to want to marry him someday.  Taking care of yourself is a darn good idea no matter what you look like.  If you mistakenly think you are more handsome than you actually are, you should still be eating right, hitting the gym regularly, etc...", "Because they explained it enough this time that everyone can see how dumb it is lol. \"You told him he's unattractive\" is 100% projection.", "> No they don't just suddenly stop BUT if they really want to be ~~happy~~ [not alone] in their lives they take the advice at some point and get the help they need. \n\nSorry I have just seen this way too many times. These men get married and then still believe every hot girl they see would jump their bones if he wasn\u2019t married. And his wife knows it. \n\n> I am sorry your Dad was an AH, no kid deserves that. It doesn't mean that every man who has these ideals can't change. \n\nI\u2019ve never met a man who did. I\u2019ve met a LOT who didn\u2019t. Some of whom are friends, even ones who were explicitly told they were being ridiculous.\n\n> The same goes for women, I have met some whose ideals are so ridiculous it's crazy. \n\nNever said that wasn\u2019t true. \n\n> One lady I knew threw her entire family away because her husband didn't meet her body ideals. \n\n**I notice you said HUSBAND.** And that (surprise surprise) getting married to someone who was not conventionally attractive enough wasn\u2019t ultimately more important to her than family. \n\nWas that not what I said would probably happen if this guy \u201clowered his standards?\u201d \n\n> She ended up living in a hotel room with the dude and losing her kids, swearing up and down she was happy. \n\nAgain. How are you not just proving my point?\n\n> We all know how that turned out. \n\nYes. We do.\n\n> This 22 year old needs therapy\n\nYou have a lot more faith in therapy than I do for these types of situations. Most of the men I know who are like this sought out hot female therapists and treated therapy like date night. \n\n> He doesn't sound like a bad dude, but he needs help. \n\nHonestly I disagree. Anyone who unironically talks about someone not being in their \u201cleague\u201d sounds like a total asshole to me.\n\n> He is young and has his whole life in front of him.\n\nThis is also true of lots of young women who would probably be better off not dating him.", "> **You didn't have to be so snarky.**\n\n**Sorry, as an owner of breasts, who doesn\u2019t like them analyzed by strangers in public, your description about his critique of women\u2019s breast size (at 50 years old) got me feeling snarky.**\n\n> **Yes, he can be a total AH but still.**\n\n**What do you mean, \u201cbut still?!\u201d** \n\n> I was making the point that if this guy that OP is talking about really has such lofty standards that can't be met, someone really should talk to him. \n\nSo what? So he can deign to date women he thinks are beneath him? How lucky for them. \n\n> He actually has a chance at 22 to turn it around and not wait half his life to figure it out. \n\n\u201cTurn it around?\u201d Are you honest to Jesus telling me you think he would have genuinely found it less important that he be with a gorgeous woman? Or would he have just accepted he can\u2019t have what he wants and married someone he wasn\u2019t attracted to anyway?\n\n> Our friend is just now working on himself. \n\nHow is that? Your breast size comment was in the present tense. \n\n> He can be a total AH but has redeeming qualities. Sometimes reality checks need to happen.\n\nLike I said. I think the more effective reality check is to subtly point out the actual logic. Like \u201cperhaps the reason you reject people is also the reason people are rejecting you. What is the most common reason for you rejecting someone?\u201d", "This dude\u2019s an incel. A \u201cChad\u201d is some imaginary hot dude who obviously gets all the women who reject \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d men like this. They think women jump into bed with hot aholes, so 20% of men get 80% of women. This is their favorite \u201cfact\u201d to cite. Most of these men are like Op\u2019s friend - they only want supermodels, and then blame all women when they can\u2019t get laid. In reality, they could easily get laid or be in a relationship, but they feel entitled to the hottest women, while rejecting other women as being beneath them. They feel that they shouldn\u2019t lower their standards - the women should.", "No it\u2019s not. It\u2019s how this dude was obviously going to (and clearly did) interpret it.\n\nWhich was clear in both comments.", "The woman who threw away her family, her husband was attractive, he was nice, treated her amazing, loved her kids, had a good job.  She was an idiot. \n\nI am sorry the men you know are douches. The men I know are not, even the ones who started off that way have turned their lives around. \n\nYes, I believe people can change, if that makes me naive oh well. Most people, not all, but most people have redeeming qualities.", "Well I can see this is going no where fast. \nI meant, he can be an AH but he can also be a good guy. He is always there for his friends and would do anything for them. His issues are with women and that has to do with his mom. He is now realizing that. No one told him when he was younger and his Dad was no help. \nYes, I do think it can be turned around. I think anyone who wants to turn it around can, they just have to want to.  I also agree that pointing it out subtly can work. Pointing it out anyway can help. \nWe learn as we grow and get older. We learn from our mistakes (hopefully) and make the changes in our lives that need to be made. A bad person can learn to be good. Players can settle down and be great partners.", "He absolutely doesn\u2019t. But they don\u2019t owe him a relationship either. They don\u2019t owe him anything. But saying that he doesn\u2019t have a relationship because women aren\u2019t attracted to him is blatantly false.", "He can dance and that's always a good sign!", "Women, not girls. if you're looking for High School girls, Chris Hansen wants you to take a chair over there...", "Dude you have no reading comprehension. OP is a MAN. Seriously smh \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I have before and I will do it again, and if you think it's never been said or done before, then you're deluded because it's been done and done countless times already", "Okay, the comments are totally the same and yet got different reactions for no reason at all; explaining more deeply did not at all make the response to them more negative. Sure, honey.", "> Well I can see this is going no where fast. \n\nNo shit. \n\n> I meant, he can be an AH but he can also be a good guy. \n\nGood guys don\u2019t act like assholes. \n\n> He is always there for his friends and would do anything for them. \n\nHis **friends.** \n\n> His issues are with women and that has to do with his mom. He is now realizing that. No one told him when he was younger and his Dad was no help. \n\nThe same is true of almost every person like your friend I know. None have found success in therapy. \n\n> Yes, I do think it can be turned around. I think anyone who wants to turn it around can, they just have to want to.  \n\nThey have to want to. To want to\u2026. will themselves to date someone they don\u2019t think is attractive?\n\n> I also agree that pointing it out subtly can work. Pointing it out anyway can help. We learn as we grow and get older. \n\nIt\u2019s almost like that was my whole point. \n\n> We learn from our mistakes (hopefully) and make the changes in our lives that need to be made. \n\nThat\u2019s the goal. \n\n> A bad person can learn to be good. \n\nSure\n\n> Players can settle down and be great partners.\n\nTo someone they\u2019re attracted to.", "But if the bar is really that low, then surely this nice, affable, resourceful guy should have no problem scoring a gorgeous bombshell... right?", "Which changes nothing.", "You say if sarcastically but frankly I still don\u2019t see a difference. There\u2019s nothing in the second one that wasn\u2019t clearly in the first one also. It\u2019s just Reddit doing Reddit things. I think the reactions are dependent on where the comment was made, rather than what was in it.\n\nWhich was my point.", "Initial attraction is important, however you can become attracted to someone as you get to know them also. \n\nI said I only disagreed a little, we actually agreed on a lot more but you like to pick apart everything I said. That's okay. \n\nJust because your friends didn't have successful therapy doesn't mean someone else can't. \n\nWe can debate all night but we both agree this dude needs to change and figure himself out if he wants a relationship and to be happy. Hopefully he can do that. \n\nHave a great night!", "And the woman who left her husband was attracted to her husband, he just didn't fit her \"dream\" body type. Again, she was an idiot.", "No. He should and does not have any problem getting dates. But he rejects them. Society\u2019s bar for men being in hell doesn\u2019t mean individual women\u2019s bars are also in hell.", "OP says he\u2019s male", "OP is a dude.", "Omg \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Okay now I\u2019m just ignoring everything you say.\n\nGood luck and best wishes at getting all the therapy you so clearly need.", "You realise there is more to looks than \u201cconventionally attractive\u201d and \u201cugly\u201d, right?", "It really doesn\u2019t. I used to know someone who was objectively in great shape and very good looking. He sought partners who were also very attractive but they always treated him like shit. I said, why not go for someone who treats you well rather focus on what they look like. It had nothing to do with his looks and it didn\u2019t even mean the potential date needed to be worse looking - just focusing on the way people treat one another rather than looks. He didn\u2019t take my advice (which is completely fine) and he is still single.", "I still don\u2019t see how bringing this person up as an example in defense of your friend who has a \u201cdream\u201d body type was somehow disproving my point."]}
