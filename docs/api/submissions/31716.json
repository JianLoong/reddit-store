We attend a university that\u2019s about an hour\u2019s drive from my family home. Since Steven\u2019s parents are out of the country, he had planned on just staying on campus for a few days of the break, but I insisted that he come with me.\r\n\nWe left school on Wednesday afternoon and planned on staying with my family until Saturday afternoon, and then we\u2019d head back to school.\r\n\nFor the vast majority of the more than two days, Steven actually didn\u2019t spend much time with me at all. We got to the house pretty late on Wednesday, and Steven ended up playing video games with my younger brother (Josh M17) for most of the night. I had planned on showing him around town on Thursday, but he ended up spending most of the day helping my younger sister (Emma F15) write her history essay.\r\n\nI agreed to wait for him, but after a few hours, I got bored and went out with some of my friends in town. When I got back, he still wasn\u2019t able to hang out, as he was helping my mom cook, of all things. We did end up going for a short walk after dinner, but that was about it.\r\n\nOn Friday, Steven again spent most of the day playing video games with my brother, and later he helped my dad work on his project car; we literally had no time to spend together. I was feeling pretty bummed out that we didn\u2019t get to spend time together as I had hoped, but I was also a little annoyed that Steven was trying to insert himself into my family rather than just being my BF.\r\n\nDuring the car ride back to campus today, I told him how I felt, and he initially brushed it off, saying that he had fun. I was annoyed he wasn\u2019t taking me seriously, so I told him that I thought he was sort of trying to steal my family away. He said I was being ridiculous and was imagining it. I then repeated what I said and told him that while we were in a relationship, he needed to respect the boundaries of my place in my family.\r\n\nThe rest of the car ride was awkward afterward, and he dropped me off at the house I share with my roommates. My roommates could tell I was pretty flustered, so I told them what happened, and they agreed with me that Steven was out of line. Steven later texted me, apologizing, but I decided to ignore it as I feel that if he really means it, he\u2019ll come over and apologize in person. My roommates, however, think I should just accept the apology and move on as it\u2019s petty for me not to respond.\r\n\nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1700951805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183vjni/aita_for_accusing_my_bf_of_stealing_my_family/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have spent time with him while he was doing most of these things, like playing games with your brother and helping your mother cook.

I would love to have a bf that just clicks so well with my family. Also, you guys spend all your time together at school daily I assume ? so what\u2019s literally 3 days of the attention not being on you ? he probably didn\u2019t take you serious and only apologized because it seems ridiculous", "YTA.  It's understandable for you to want to spend time with him and to tell him so.

You are coming across as incredibly needy, insecure, and pathetic.", "YTA. He made a huge effort to get to know your family and spend time with them, unlike you. There were numerous opportunities for you to join in - helping your mom cook, helping with your sister\u2019s essay, for instance.\n\nAnd I find it really dubious that your friends thought he was out of line. \n\nyour boyfriend needs a girlfriend who appreciates him.

I get that he should have balanced his time but he might not know how to turn down your sibling. You could have told your sister you have plans and he needed to go. His response would have told you more. As far as your parents, I think he was trying to be nice.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re in college so stop with the games. It\u2019s not a good look.

Like, any one of those things YOU COULD HAVE JOINED IN ON!  Why be salty that he was bonding so well instead of just being there for it?", "Uhmmm... most women I know would love it if their boyfriend went to such an effort to connect with their family.", "INFO: Did you insist that he come with you because you didn\u2019t want him to be lonely, or because you didn\u2019t trust him on his own?

He connected with your family and you\u2019re upset about it?  I am with everyone else - the red flags are you.  He was the perfect boyfriend.  You don\u2019t know how lucky you have it.

Also, you're being very immature with the whole apology thing. YTA.", "I want to go with a very, very gentle ESH.  He is your partner, and should have spent a LITTLE time with you.  He didnt need to brush your feelings off, that doesnt feel right.  HOWEVER connecting with your family and building a good relationship with them is a great thing.  So many dudes wouldnt put in that much effort to get good with your family.\n\nAccusing him of stealing your family is an asshole move.  You had legit feelings that needed adressing, and better communication between both of you would have spared any hurt feelings.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is def. Sounds like it was a minor, (but still valid) issue that may have blown up a bit.", "YTA. Family liking a significant other means a ton, and he was getting an opportunity to.

You could've spent plenty of time with him if you had also been spending time with your family rather than pushing for alone time.

Goodbye", "YTA. The only thing he might have done differently is spend less time playing video games with your brother, otherwise he was bonding with your family during the family holiday you invited him to join.

OP please break up with him so some lucky woman who deserves him can have him.", "Agreed... huge AH to be upset with him. The dude hung out with her brother (usually a hard relationship for a BF to build), helped her sister with homework and helped her mom cook on the busiest day of the year.\n\nI can't think of a better way for a BF who is just meeting family to act.\n\nWhen I went to my college GFs house I helped around, chopped wood with her dad and brothers, helped cook... Etc. That goal is to participate in what your family is doing.", "Yup, totally agree with you. He is one of the good guys. I wish my daughter would meet a nice young man like one.
