I\u2019m assuming she was asking to have your Grandmas spice rack after she passed ? If so \u2026 the timing of that question was completely inappropriate. She should be the one apologising to you and your Mom. I think calling her a vulture was fairly light under the circumstances. Anything you said should be put aside because you were sleep deprived, emotional and watching your grandma die. \n\nIn those circumstances people that aren\u2019t related should be there to act as help and support for their spouses, and should keep quiet otherwise.  If she is so desperate for the spice rack she should have asked your cousin in a private moment a few days later and then he could ask your mom (and only when the family have decided  to sort through her belongings)", "Yes, she's a vulture, and it's a very common bird indeed. You never really know someone until you share an inheritance with them. I had a great-aunt demand stuff from my grandfather's house before he died; an uncle who waited to catch me walking into the funeral to offer to take some 'worthless' items 'off my hands.' Why apologise? Do you really want to reach out? All you have to do is get sick, and she'll be right back demanding to read your will.", "NTA, anyone who is picking over inheritance before the person is even dead is indeed a vulture.\n\nI'd be responding with \"I'll apologize for calling you a vulture when you apologize for trying to line your own pockets literally over my grandmother's deathbed.\"", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t feel like part of the family, she doesn\u2019t treat them like family. Grandma wasn\u2019t even dead yet and she\u2019s badgering for what stuff she\u2019s gonna get. Can\u2019t even offer condolences or feel sad, just grab the eldest daughter and demand her mothers stuff.", "Tell her that you are sorry she felt offended by being called a vulutre when she asked for the spice rack while visiting your dying grandmother -- an animal that circles its prey upon their death.", "Your mom was losing HER mom, spending all her time at her mother's death bed, and gets pulled aside by her nephew's wife over a spicerack?\n\nI'd have gifted her the rack with lube so she could go f\\*ck herself with it.\n\nNTA", "Nope, NTA & I'd \"lose\" that spice rack.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "Apologize for being accurate? Nope, no apology necessary here, not even a fake one to keep the peace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA, though vultures do perform a valuable service in nature by cleaning up carrion.  I'd have called her something worse rather than insulting a whole bird species.", "NTA. First off, don't apologize if you're not sorry. Also, it's not like you said anything that wasn't true. Calling out someone's bad behavior, especially in those circumstances, is absolutely not something you should be expected to apologize for.", "NTA.  A deathbed is not the place to put in requests for trinkets.  My SIL died earlier this year and I cannot imagine anyone, at any point, as we spent her final days gathered in the hospital, suddently saying, \"Hey, if no one has dibs on the ice machine...\"   \n\nIf anything I'd call the woman to tell her you were wrong to call her a vulture--they wait for their target to die before they start picking away.", "NTA. Death first to vultures and scavengers.", "NTA \n\nDon't apologize to this vulture.", "she was completely out of line.  her priority should have been providing support for the family, not calling dibs on stuff that she wants after your cousin's (not even hers) grandmother passes away.  it isn't even her place to receive anything.  ugh, i'm so sorry you had to deal with her.  IMO your reaction was completely justified, and she owes you and the rest of the family an apology for putting more importance on stuff (that she isn't even entitled to in the first place) than the loss you were suffering.  you don't owe her shit.  NTA.", "Hell no to asshole, hell yes to vulture.", ">  I would need to apologize first\n\nin order for... what?  What needs to happen that you're holding up by not apologizing?\n\n> I cannot bring myself to reach out.\n\nOK, but why would you?\n\nI-N-F-O I guess I just don't get why any of this is on your radar, who cares if she doesn't apologize, who cares if cousin took her side, why is it an issue four months later?\n\nEDIT well I guess it's NTA either way really, but my questions stand", "NTA. As a fake wildlife biologist, she sounds like a fucking vulture. You\u2019re better than me if you apologize but for the sake of good vibes it\u2019s probably best if you do.", "No. NTA. God I remember when my grandmother was in the hospital because she had heart problems. Or when my dad went in for a quadruple bypass after suffering a heart attack. No one was worried about spice racks or money or clothes or whatever other item. We were bedside, crying, and praying for our loved one to get better. She is a vulture and I hope she feels alienated until she learns the error of her ways. I cannot believe that while her relative was dying, she was worried about a SPICE RACK. Talk about self centered. I hope you show her this thread, just spam her email with screenshots. Do NOT apologize. You\u2019re NTA, at all", "Asking for a fucking spice rack whilst grandma is on her fucking deathbed??? I would have called her something a lot worse than just a vulture. \n\nAlso, a fucking spice rack? WTF.", "Weird time to meditate", "NTA.  My momma always said, vulture is as vulture does.", "NTA. She's a god damned ghoul and SHE needs to apologize for that behavior. Jesus.", "NTA. Deaths in the family bring out the worse in people. The best way to think about it is her \"worst\" is disregarding and disrespecting your grandmothers memory. And your \"worst\" is a rude comment to her in response to that. I think you're very valid and I wouldn't apologize for saying the truth. The only thing I might do to keep the peace is reach out to clear the air but I would expressly avoid apologizing.", "NTA-\n\nGrief can last for months even years before it gets small enough to handle. \n\nNo one should be asking for anything as they are watching a loved one slowly taking their last breaths.  The only person who should be asking for anything is that person laying in that bed and that's if they can even speak. \n\nDo not apologize! Don't give into that for the sake of \"keeping the peace\" she couldn't respect you're family, and even more so your dying grandmother. She is a vulture and I feel sorry for your cousin.", "ESH she is a vulture - causing a scene in the hospital, next to dying grandma wasn\u2019t the time. Def don\u2019t apologize to her.

I don\u2019t know what world she\u2019s living in where she thinks that was an appropriate time to start calling dibs on shit. \n\nAlso I wanna know what was so special about this spice rack that she felt so compelled to ask about it by the poor woman\u2019s deathbed.", "NTA. 100% on your side. \n\nMy BIL (at the time and obviously that didn't last, thank god) asked for the gun my dad killed himself with. The fucking night it happened he was acting like he should get the gun for \"safe keeping.\" I went black out with rage and unleashed on him verbally. Thankfully my family all had my back. \n\nAnyone that is trying to take from the near-dead, the dead, and/or their grieving family needs to have their shit called out *right away and loudly.* \n\nI am so mad right now on your behalf. How could there be *anyone* in your family that sides or sees her point of view?", "If I were OP I'd get that spice rack for myself, even if I thought it was hideous. Lord knows my grandma's spice rack was hideous. And she never used any \"spice\" but salt, pepper, and bacon grease so most of those jars were empty.", "I had always heard that about death in families but this was my first real experience falling out. I will miss my cousin but I just cannot apologize for how I felt that day.", "This is the only response that OP needs to read. My stepdad died in a violent accident and the next day my uncle was trying to convince my mom that it was a blessing in disguise because she could finally find someone with money. He didn\u2019t want her to invite my stepdad\u2019s family to come visit or look at his things because he thought they\u2019d be \u201cgreedy\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful to your (my mom\u2019s) rights\u201d.\n\nNot at all the truth, he just wanted first dibs on sports shirts and expensive racing bikes. Anyone who would act like that knows exactly what they\u2019re doing and it\u2019s despicable. The worst part is they know that they\u2019re the only ones who give a shit about property in that moment, that they\u2019re the only ones thinking clearly, so they try to take advantage by disguising their selfishness as empathy. Unfortunately OP\u2019s cousin has made it crystal clear what they prioritize and how they view their family members.", "We found a picture of the spice rack in my grandma\u2019s pictures and it took every ounce of self-control I had not to stick it in an envelope and mail it to her. Signed with love, of course. :)", "Yeah I really could\u2019ve added more details. My cousin\u2019s attempt to mediate was telling me that his wife would apologize to me if I apologize first because I hurt her feelings. It\u2019s weighing on me still because up until the hospital, I was close to my cousin and saw him more as a little brother. I guess the holidays bring up old hurt feelings.", "EDIT my cousin will not come around the family because his wife doesn\u2019t feel welcome. I guess my apology for calling her out in the hospital would help her feel better.", "Serenity can be found anywhere. Namaste.", "Death does bring out the worst. I\u2019m thankful that \u201cspicegate\u201d was the worst of our family squabbles. I know plenty of cases where the family dissolved after a grandmother\u2019s passing. I have to stop and remember we\u2019re (mostly) still whole. <3", "Username checks out. Thank you <3", "It\u2019s a set of that looks like a little village/houses. I guess she liked it enough to ask my grandma for it about five months before she passed. My grandma told her it was going to be up to her kids (my mom, aunt and uncle) but told EVERYONE else in the family about it. I think that was the real trigger that day. I knew my nana would\u2019ve wanted me to tell her to kick rocks. Lol", "Heck, my wife's grandmother is dying of cancer (chemo wasn't helping, and just making her miserable, so she decided to just stop and accept it).  We were just there over the weekend for what will likely be her last family Christmas.\n\nNana insisted we take some stuff from her shelf.  We both thought it was rather inappropriate, but she wanted to know for sure that the kids and grandkids got something they actually wanted and to be able to enjoy that while she was still here.\n\nBut still, even then, the idea of picking over a dying woman's belongings while she was right there ASKING us to do it felt wrong.  I can't imagine the kind of person that would do this like OP said.", "Better yet, you adopt the spice rack, display it prominently, take a family photo in front of it, mail THAT one off to her! Petty, yes!\n\nEdit: OP, NTA!", "Make a spice rack calendar with it in a different spot for each month. Calendars make nice gifts.

I get that it must have been uncomfortable for you guys. \n\nBut at the same time, it's a very heartwarming moment for her. I guess she wanted to make sure that you liked what you picked and have a piece of her. Knowing that you have a piece of her house and of her.\n\nAlso, she's making sure that no one will come after your \" gift.\" It's a bittersweet moment, I'm sure.

NOT. APOLOGIZE to that\u2026.thing!  I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I\u2019m staggered that she had the gall to even bring up material things while your grandma was living her last breaths of life. And your mom\u2026.\nOk your cousins wife need to be put in her place. Not with an apology but something like:\n\n\u201cRight Cousin\u2019s Wife.

But she most definitely is.", "NTA.  Forget good manners, common decency says you do NOT ask someone whose mother is dying if you can have anything!

My parent is not in charge of their estate they are just involved with medical as the other children cannot be bothered to visit or even check on my grandparents. So many people are just wacky about inheritance. Like my grandparents are modest people. Not a bunch of money, nothing too fancy, so what is my parent to want? I hate even thinking about my grandparents dying, I definitely cannot imagine picking over their belongings.", "Thankfully, the only person supporting her is my cousin. She\u2019s caused so many rifts in the family aside from this situation and he\u2019s alienated. I keep hope alive that he\u2019ll wake up eventually.
