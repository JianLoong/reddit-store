{"id": 7365, "submission_id": "10c6mr2", "title": "AITA for leaving my bf in a snowstorm?", "selftext": "I (33f) and bf (37m) went for a drive and stopped at a scenic overlook where I accidentally kicked my debit card out of the truck. It's a deserted area and it was below 10\u00b0F outside,  pretty unlikely anyone else would have even stopped there at that point. So I asked if he'd mind if I dropped by the overlook to see if my card was there, as it was only a few miles out of the way and we didn't have anywhere to be. He initially said that was fine. As I made the turn off the main highway it was getting dark and it started snowing lightly. He became very upset and started being very negative, telling me I was dumb for not keeping better track of my card and being very skeptical that the card would still be there. I don't understand where this came from but he began insisting we go home and not go look for it. \n\nI told him I was going to look, it would only take a few minutes. And he unbuckled his seatbelt and said, \"fine, let me out.\" I began to slow down and said it was dangerously cold outside, he wasn't dressed for it, but if he got out I intended to go on with my errand. He repeated his desire to get out, even opening the door and putting his foot out before I was fully stopped. \n\nHe began to rant about how dumb this was, and refused to get back in, but also refused to shut the door. He was clear of the vehicle though so I drove away and let the door shut from the forward motion of the truck. I went to the overlook, collected my debit card, then went back to see if he was over his tantrum yet. I was gone for about 15 minutes, during which time he absolutely began to blow up my phone, though  service was poor. When I returned I asked if he wanted a ride home, he got in and began absolutely berating me. I told him he was welcome to get out again, but he wouldn't, so made my way to his house. He asked me to come inside, but it felt really... off? Idk, I didn't want to go in but I was kind of nervous to say no after all this. I told him I'd be in after a moment, and instead drove away. \n\nI haven't spoken to him since, I think I'm done with that relationship. I blocked him to give myself some time to think. But his mom and daughter have both been sending me texts that I was wrong for leaving him in the cold, that I didn't care if he died out there, and that I am a terrible person. I have trouble seeing how any of this is my fault since he's the one who wanted out of the truck, but...

He put himself out in a snowstorm and decided to stay there. Then blamed you for leaving him there when he refused to get back in the car? \n\nNow his mother and daughter are angry that you let her adult son/ adult father make his own decisions and is interfering with your relationship, gaslighting you into thinking this is your fault? \n\nNTA \n\nDefinitely a toxic relationship though and I support you leaving.", "NTA He wanted to play stupid games and is now mad at the stupid prize he won. Don't let his family gaslight you.  He is now trying to triangulate you using his mother and kid. Keep him blocked and run far far away from this family.", "NTA. Trust your instincts.", "NTA and definitely never talk to him again. He agreed then changed his mind, then got mad when you treated him like an adult,  Then made you feel unsafe after a rant about him dealing with the consequences of his actions?!?! Yeah leave him, block him and move on. Always trust your gut.", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult and made the decision to get out of the truck and pitch a tantrum. Trust your instincts and be done.", "Nta he acted like a child over something so dumb. What was the big deal of you going back to look for your card? You called his bluff, he lost. I don\u2019t get what he was even flipping out for. Also I think you had the right instinct not to go in the house with him. He was so enraged and I think there was something creepy about it. Idk what but I think being done with him is the right call.", "This is a weird story, and a bit of it just feels off, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt here.\n\nHe did that and he's THIRTY SEVEN?\n\n\nWhat a child! If he has a history of acting like this, then you need to seriously consider kicking him to the curb.\n\nGood on you for still going back for the idiot, but that's some grade-a emotional blackmail on his part. BEWARE!!\n\n- NTA", "NTA. Sounds pretty toxic. I would have at least sent him a text after driving off explaining why you weren\u2019t comfortable joining him inside. But you do you.", "NTA, but you probably have deeper communication issues, I had to go reread your ages because both of you are acting like teenagers. Him with deciding to quit and wanting his way or the highway, and you with saying you\u2019re gonna come in and then just driving away.\n\nEdit: Given that personal safety was a concern, then driving away was probably the right call.", "NTA \n\nAnybody says different is crazy you asked MULTIPLE times if he was sure he wanted to get out he\u2019s a GROWN ASS MAN be fr and I don\u2019t blame you for not going in with him we don\u2019t know what could\u2019ve have happened since he was already pissed and berating you it\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t go in. Block his mother and daughter and be done !", "NTA. This is all on him. You're better off without him.", "This is gonna get deleted but NTA. Although telling him you're coming inside then not is kind of an asshole thing to do, but completely overshadowed by his behavious.", "ESH His behavior is unacceptable, and you shouldn\u2019t have left him in those conditions. What if if the truck broke down, what if something happened to you, etc. It was not safe to do that. The way he treated you for a common human error is just not ok though, you should pay attention to his actions and consider if that is the future you see yourself in.", "ESH. While yes, you got lucky and your card was there, he could very easily have gotten frostbite in that weather. Are his fingers worth less to you than the inconvenience of calling your bank and reporting it lost? Also going to call you an asshole for driving off. He\u2019s a dick for berating you, but you\u2019re 33. You\u2019re old enough to have the impending break up conversation like an adult.\n\nEdit: Changing to ESH because that\u2019s a better fit to what I was thinking and frankly I forgot it was an option.", "ESH\n\nHe\u2019s definitely worse than you though.  Your one mistake was leaving him outside, that did risk his health. He was the one that got unhinged first, then just wanted to wait outside like a toddler having a tantrum. Then freaked out when he realized how cold it was, and then berated you on the way home.  And then complained to his mom and sister that you left him there, when HE\u2019s the one who told you to.  Sheesh.  Don\u2019t blame you for not going into his house, if you didn\u2019t feel safe, so be it.  And yeah, if you didn\u2019t feel safe, you should probably think of getting out of the relationship.", "YTA\nYes, it was dumb for him to act as such, but you shouldnt have left him there, seeing as it was relatively cold.", "ESH \nYea that was kinda dumb to leave him. Even if he pulled off a tantrum like a child you put him in great danger for no Real reason other then making a POINT.

A grown man that sets his mommy on you later to also berate you?  \n\nI think she's well out of it, and nice enough to have gone back to get him and give him a second chance to back out of HIS crazy decision.  Why should his fingers be more important to her than they  were to him?", "He\u2019s the one throwing a fit and opening the car door while she was driving.  He was bluffing and she called it. What\u2026he couldn\u2019t handle staying in the car for a a few minutes while she looks for her card? He was only in the cold for 15 minutes.

Trust your instincts in these situations because this is how people get hurt. I obviously know nothing about your boyfriend other than he seems childish, but if you feel like you need to lie to get out of a potentially unsafe situation that\u2019s not bad communication, it\u2019s smart. If you were doing it to be petty that\u2019s one thing but it doesn\u2019t sound like that. \n\nFuck politeness.\n\nEdit: and for the record any man (or person really) who makes you feel unsafe after an argument is not a person you should be with. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s hypothetical or if nothing has ever happened, trust yourself.", "I am not sure what you\u2019re talking about. I never edited my comment or said the OP was the asshole. I just said they are both acting childish.\n\nThat said, after knowing that personal safety was a concern, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s childish behavior anymore.", "Ohhh thats what ESH is for. Well i guess i gotta Edit my answer then", "Wanted to say exactly this. If personal safety is ever a concern, do yourself a favor and end this relationship asap."]}
