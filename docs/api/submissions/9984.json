I don't often say something like \"look up\" but I have often done a pointed cough (which I stopped doing for a bit with the pandemic but I'm back at it now I guess, because it scares them a little more). Interestingly this story is about two people, and I've generally found couples the worst to try and pass because they often think they deserve the entire sidewalk and refuse to squish together so that a person can pass on to the side of them. Would it have been that hard for the GF to squish a little to the side?", "I say \u201cthe worlds up here\u201d", "I'd say ESH, myself.  The girl should have been paying attention, and bears some responsibility too.", "And the girl on her phone should have seen OP and his gf coming, but she chose not to watch where she's going. She's equally at fault. ESH.", "Weird power play but ok.", "On the flip side, the girl in question could have an invisible illness", "I've done this when a group of three people were taking up the whole sidewalk. Crashed into a guy and he dropped his phone. Sorry not sorry", "It shouldn\u2019t be unpopular among people who walk a lot. One of us has to move. It\u2019s fair to follow a system.", "This is what I was hoping to see. Walking on a sidewalk or in a hallway has the same rules as driving.", "Really infuriating seeing that this is a split issue. Why is it on us, who look where we are going to not bump into people who can't even give a fuck where they are going?\n\nLike do I have to keep an eye out if they're gonna step on a puddle too? Exactly far out of my way, and how much effort do I gotta put in to not be an asshole to someone deliberately choosing to prioritize their phone, over their own well-being.", "I completely agree! I live in Australia, so we drive on the Left and I walk on the Left. I refuse to move for anyone walking toward me. If they're clueless with their damn phones, the deserve to be walked into. NTA", "What's the difference between OP walking into someone intentionally, and a zombie doing it unintentionally?  One's an AH, one's an AH on purpose.", "I don't get everyone who thinks this. \n\nSure, it's annoying for you when you see deadwalkers like that, but that's a personal opinion. Not everyone shares those values, and not everyone thinks it is an as important issue.\n\nYou're basically taking your OWN values and elevating it to a right to deliberately walk into someone? What if they drop and break their phone? What if they hit their head badly? It's extremely self centered, and not a healthy way to cope with what is basically your own personal subjective annoyance!\n\nWhat if I really annoyed myself with people with face tattoos or people who play music loudly on their phone standing still? Do I also have the right to collide with them by walking into them?\n\nGet over yourself and grow up. YTA", "You may not live in a crowded area, but larger cities like Tokyo, NYC, HK DEFINITELY have sides to walk on depending on the direction.   Escalators even have sides to stand on!   : )", "Same with driving. I drive any lane, you don't own it. Get out of my way!", "Exactly!! How did my GF walk into this person any more than they walked into her?? I\u2019m pretty surprised how many AH votes I\u2019m getting. Heheh.", "Or don't live anywhere that's populated enough for pedestrian social rules to make sense.", "I guess the whole point of my story is that the other girl got upset because my GF walked into her without acknowledging the fact that she was at least equally to blame.  Like, when two people walk into each other how can one of them be more at fault than the other?", "The information was spacial awareness, the other girl had access to the same information but was too arrogant to use it.\n\nThe only ego is someone walking and not looking where they are going ,expecting the world to move around them.", "They held their ground which im assuming means stopped.\n\nIf you walk into a stationary object the only one at fault is you.", "But if she was driving it'd be her fault. If she was texting while walking and got hit by a \nCar in a crosswalk itd be her fault. \n\nBut a person into another peraon is different. Explain\n\nExplain it in one of these contexts.", "Totally agree.  But it was a wide sidewalk.  No need for us to move for her.  She just expected us to get out of her way and we didn\u2019t.  Then she got mad.", "Kept walking. I guess I shouldn\u2019t have said \u201ccrashed into her\u201d. That\u2019s an exaggeration. She just bumped her.", "Gratuitous Captain America reference FTW!  \\o/", "Don't walk with your face burried in your phone then you won't have to worry about someone telling you to look up.", "Sorry I don\u2019t think I understand what you mean, How would they be the stupid ones if someone was driving on the wrong side of the road towards them? Or do you mean like if they kept driving?", "They were right, dead right, as they drove along, \nBut they're just as dead as if they were wrong.", "You are upset that you are at less risk of colliding with things? If they are about to walk into you and you see them coming but don't want to move, you can just yell \"hey, look out\".", "Is that a bad thing?\n\nThe sidewalk zombie voluntarily gave up their ability to navigate a busy sidewalk.  It just turns out that OP was more willing to handle the consequences of a collision.", "No one got hurt.  It was just a bump.", "tell me you've never lived in a city before without telling me lol when my ass is walking somewhere i'm not playing \"dodge the clueless pedestrian\"", "Flashbacks to seeing all the Americans comment \"You're the asshole for doing the speed limit and not speeding.\" on a post a bit back.", "Because your girlfriend sought out the situation.\n\nAlso \u201cheheheh\u201d?", "Because your girlfriend knew the other person was there and did it intentionally. I get that the other person was being rude and not \"following the rules\" but it doesn't give your gf the right to body check her. You both need to grow up.", "The video didn\u2019t feature distracted walkers, though? It featured men who saw a woman walking in the path toward them and they all seemed to have the understanding that the woman was going to move out of the way by default. They were so sure she\u2019d get out of their way that they almost always got to the point where they collided. That was what was so shocking about the video, it\u2019s that the guys were just so dead set on not being to one to have to move that they straight up walked into someone.", "The person not watching where they\u2019re going is the inconsiderate walker.", "One did it intentionally, one was rudely unaware, but wouldn\u2019t have walked into your gf if your gf behaved as an adult. \nYou don\u2019t get to physically touch anyone then be smug about it. You and your girlfriend have no right to intentionally touch anyone without their permission.", "But you expected her to get out of your way?", "If your girlfriend had just stopped I could accept that as making a point because that might be something someone would do to try to avoid colliding. But to keep walking knowing she was going to run into her was an asshole move.", "If they kept driving, just like they kept walking. If I see a driver coming at me, I'm going to get out of the way, no matter what side of the road they're on.", "Honestly, it's still stupid if someone's driving on the wrong side of the road towards you.\n\nBeing in the right doesn't your funeral any more fun.", "We are talking about if people are \u201cassholes\u201d here, I\u2019d argue intentionality in decision making is crucial in determining if the person is an AH", "It\u2019s still not cool.", "And what if they did get hurt? What if they dropped their phone and broke it? You think that's cool too? You'd break someone's phone because you disagree with them getting caught up and not looking? Way to punish a mistake, man. Next time I see you do something I don't personally like, I'll push you over, after all it's just a bump", "What if they have a mobility, spatial awareness or balance disorder?\n\nIntentionally ramming into people just because they\u2019re annoying you is inappropriate", "I shoulder checked a girl and spun her around once. Group of 3 walking in the sidewalk, I'd have had to step into the parking lot to pass.  So I stayed on the edge of the sidewalk and refused to move. Dropped my shoulder a bit as I approached. If she'd been willing to make a little room, she would been fine.", "THIS.\n\nI just laughed out loud \ud83d\ude02", "Damn almost like those are two distinctly different situations that should be approached differently."]}
