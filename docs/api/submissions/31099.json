Do not give to Rose, she needs to learn to budget and live within her means.", "NTA. Your daughters should be equal in your eyes and wallets. They both made decisions that shape their current lives and it isn't fair to take away from Lily due to decisions made by Rose. Lily may change her mind later and it would be horrible to have to tell her that you gave her money to Rose even though Rose had already gotten money before. There's plenty of those stories on this site.", "NTA, they are irresponsible with their money, your choice is to use the money for them now or save it for a wedding. One way or another it sounds like you will let her have the money. If she uses it now, she pays for her own wedding.", "NTA. Taking the money earmarked for Lily's wedding and giving it to Rose is literally \"throwing the good money after the bad.\" The difference between the two sisters is not how much they earned but how well they manage what they have. Lily and her partner are financially savvy and responsible, and Rose and her husband are not. No matter how much money you give Rose, it will go to waste. Having a child your wife's been watching for free = no childcare expenses, so \"ahh, having a child is harder\" is just an excuse your wife has made up to guilt you. The child is also not homeless; they have a roof over their heads. You would not be the first set of parents who enable the less competent child at the expense of the more competent one, and this inequality and favoritism rarely if ever does any favors to the parents' relationship with the more capable (but less favored) child or the relationship between the siblings. Favoring the child who has a child of their own over the child who doesn't (at least not yet), same. What's fair is fair. Unfair doesn't become okay just because Rose spends all the money she gets her hands on.", "NTA\nI understand where your wife is coming from but I am not for people being punished for making good decisions.", "NTA. Instead of giving Rose cash, which she and her husband will likely either squander or run through in a big hurry, the best thing you and your wife can give Rose and her husband is ***sessions with a financial advisor***. It may be that Rose will need to wait a bit longer to buy a home, but until she and her husband are secure enough to know they will not need future help paying their mortgage, taxes or maintenance, they likely aren't ready to be homeowners.\n\nI am in no way saying this is anyone's fault. Some people are just better with money, less impulsive with their spending and more mindful of saving, and sometimes life just happens and you have costs like, well, expensive child care. But if Rose really wants to start getting ahead financially, it's not going to happen until she has a financial education and she and her husband change their spending habits and learn to stick to a budget which includes set-asides for emergencies and future plans (like a house or a college education).", "NTA. You literally say that Rose is financially irresponsible, and giving her money now would surely only encourage her to continue that trend. She's almost 30 and should know better.", "NTA.  Your grandchild isn't living on the streets.  She **has** a home, just not  the house Rose wants. Your wife hasn't figured out that Rose will go through that money like water and have her hand out for more before the ink is dry on the mortgage.  Nothing is making things harder on Rose except Rose and her husband.", "NTA, giving Rose more money is just rewarding her bad spending habits, whereas Lily has saved and lived within her means and should get the same as Rose. \n\nYou already said you've been helping out Rose financially, that is not fair to Lily even if she hasn't mentioned it. Rose needs to learn to live within her means.", "NTA. Do not give it over. Rose needs a reality check, not a bail out. And there will be a time Lily needs the money and will cause resentment if she doesn't get it.", "[deleted]", "NAH.  From what it sounds like, Rose isn't asking you for more money.  Your wife naturally wants to help her child out.  You want to keep everything fair in case Lily eventually wants/needs the wedding money.  \n\n\nRose is going to have to learn some tough lessons.  She and her family CAN get a home, despite what your wife has said (you said she was approved for a certain amount).  It's just not going to be as big as Lily's.  And that's okay.  There's nothing wrong with getting a smaller house, especially if it's all they can afford.  As for the money for Lily's wedding, I would not give it to Rose, at least at this point.  Lily is saying she doesn't want/need it, but when the time comes to marry, perhaps she and her boyfriend will have a discussion and want to take that money.  If the time to marry comes and they don't want it, then put it in a trust for your grandkid.  Or save it for when Lily has a kid (if she plans on having kids).", "NTA - your only grandchild does have a home. Her parents just don't own it but they have a place to live. You will not be helping Rose to learn to live within her means if you keep giving her money. It's a hard lesson, but one that needs to be learned. (I was guilty of this myself but once I stopped helping, my son and his family learned to live within their means and are doing well.) Rose and her husband can look for a smaller house to start with and build up equity to eventually get a bigger one.  If Lily doesn't want the money for her wedding, save it for a college fund for your grandchild(ren). Otherwise, Bank of Mom and Dad will never close for Rose.", "Your wife is the AH. She is actively enabeling your oldest in her bad decisions. The child does not suffer from homelessness. She is almost 30. It's time to put some boundaries down. Stop helping her living over her means. Teach her the reality of life. Your eldest is clearly the golden child of your wife. You go Sir. Keep things equal. If your youngest doesnt want the money put it in a trust fund FOR HER FUTURE ( childrens or not). If the eldest cant budget it's not the youngest duty to sacrifice non stop for her.", "NAH. Your wife obviously wants what is best for all involved and since Lily doesn\u2019t want the money I can see her POV. However, I personally agree with your POV. It does feel like it would be enabling poor financial habits to give the money to Rose though.", "My mom is exactly like this. Lived outside of her means, never saved a dime. She\u2019s now 76 and I, her only child, am stuck footing the bill for her life. $2k/mo!!! OP, if you want to do Rose a favor, don\u2019t bail her out this time or in the future. If someone in my mom\u2019s life had forced her to figure things out and save, we might not be in this situation now. It will only get worse.", "Lily is only 24. she hasn't gotten married (yet). So she has no need for the wedding fund money right now. But that doesn't mean it should be given away. A lot of things can happen before she is ready to get married, which may mean she would accept the wedding fund money. And then what she's out of luck because her sister doesn't know how to save. \n\nIt's money earmarked for lily. Rose is mismanaged her money that doesn't mean she gets lily's earmarked money. Nor does it mean it gets given away to roses kid.", "Absolutely. Lilly needs to know before you give it away. It's not her fault that Rose & her husband live above their means and do not save. The grandchild has a home, just not a the home the parents want. Don't punish Lilly for being financially responsible.", "NTA it never fails to surprise me when parents want to reward a child who makes poor choices and punish by proxi the child who makes good decisions and actively isn\u2019t a burden. Rose has made the decision to live beyond her means and her husband also doesn\u2019t save or behave frugally. They chose to not save, they chose to have a child. You should give equally to both your children. You should not punish one child with less because they chose to live within their means and be responsible. Your wife needs to understand that the mat kind of behavior will drive a wedge between you and your daughters. \n\nLily may say she doesn\u2019t want the money but as a younger sibling to irresponsible sisters I can tell you that she\u2019s simply trying to make sure she\u2019s not a burden like rose is.

Please stand firm on this. \n\nBoth of your daughters make similar amounts of money and had the same opportunities growing up and as adults.

They are correct. Rose is never going to live within her means until not doing so costs her something she really values. (Even then, she may not really change.)\n* Your wife should take note:\n\n1. In the time that it took Lily to double her 10-15% house deposit fund, Rose was able to whittle her same fund down to only about 5% of a house that is half the value of what she had been hoping (not planning and saving, just hoping) for.\n2. Her husband has saved ZERO in 10 years.\n3. Being a mom or dad is hard work, but how much more financially hard is it when your mother is watching your child for free? AND when you have parents who are \"constantly helping you out\"?\n4. Rose and her husband could buy a house that is (1) not such an expensive commute, (2) possibly close enough to continue benefitting from your wife's free child-care, and (3) in a price range that she and her husband CAN AFFORD!!!\n5. Rose and her husband could learn to save and manage their money better and eventually graduate to a bigger/better house once they got the hang of saving and living within their means.\n6. Currently, the bigger the mortgage Rose and her husband take on, the more likely and the deeper the debt Rose and her husband will need help paying off because they overspent their income on the nice things they want to have/keeping up with the \"Joneses\".\n\n* The fact that Lily isn't even planning to accept a wedding fund from you two does influence me, but only to consider to middle-of-the-road options, not your wife's plan. (And if Lily had been planning to accept your gift, this wouldn't even be a discussion.) Also note that the timing of this should not be driven by Rose buying a house, but done at a slower, more thoughtful pace to support a long-term plan.\n* Bottom line for Rose: she and her hubby need to stick with buying a house they can currently afford.\n\n1. If you and your wife have not set aside much for your own retirement/ senior expenses, keep Lily's wedding money safe. You can still offer it to Lily when the time comes and put anything she doesn't want/need into catching up your own retirement/senior fund.\n2. If you and wife are well-set, then understand Lily better. Ask her if she and boyfriend have any interest in a wedding, what kind of wedding. If she doesn't want/need the wedding fund you have, ask her if she would accept some of the money as just a wedding gift from you and your wife. Ask her if she would want that money earmarked for future needs of her family's (e.g., unexpected medical, kids' college funds, etc.) If those are things she might like, then that money stays earmarked for her.\n3. If Lily is firm and clear that she will not take the money, then ask her if she has any problem with you giving some of it to Rose. If that's not a problem, then you could decide to gift (no more than half) that fund to Rose and husband to pay down their mortgage or save it (yourself, not with Rose) as a college fund for Rose's child(ren). I would not give it to them directly, as it seems likely they would only fritter it away on living an above-their-means lifestyle. You can save the other half of that fund for Lily's family; use it to pay for a fun family (you two, both daughters and their families) vacation; or identify something else that benefits Lily, you and wife, or your extended family (but not just Rose's family - since they will have already received an extra boost).\n\nGood luck with getting to an agreed upon plan with your wife.", "\"No good deed goes unpunished.\"  Lily's reasonable and responsible.

I realized way too late in life that a major factor of my stress impulse spending and even general impulse spending was due to my adhd being undiagnosed and untreated for so long.  Not saying she or her SO has it but even something as simple as having a skewed framing of what you think you want can lead one to spend resources on things that don\u2019t actually matter to you or to prioritize a certain location/style of living over personal financial security without needing to always go to someone else to bail you out esp when these expenses seem very optional.  \n\nOr perhaps it would be cheaper for her SO to be a stay at home parent until the kid starts school and then they could avoid some commuting cost and more importantly child care costs.  \n\nAlso your SO is being manipulative AF with the grandchild doesn\u2019t have a home line.  Kid has a home, it\u2019s just not a big house like Rose and possible Rose\u2019s SO want.  Too bad so sad.  She can either stay where she is and save or take what she has and get a home that isn\u2019t to her liking and work on saving for an upgrade. \n\n Ultimately your SO is hurting Rose and your grandkid more by enabling Rose\u2019s financial irresponsibility behavior without helping Rose address the real underling long term issues.  Neither you nor your SO are helping her by bailing her out like she\u2019s a new teenage adult who made an honest mistake.

She also needs to accept that no one else is to blame but herself and maybe society feeding into people\u2019s psychology to overspend but there\u2019s not much one can do about the latter but there\u2019s plenty to be done about the former.  It\u2019s just a reality that she must accept before she can progress in life. \n\nRose prioritized having a kid before a house which is fine but it does complicate things.  She prioritized material things and perhaps experiences or ease which isn\u2019t wrong but once your resource like money is spent it is usually gone.  She cannot have all these things AND the same house as her sis.  Bc her sis did not prioritize the same things Rose did. Again nothing wrong with that BUT it means Rose has less to work with for obtaining a home and she\u2019ll need to compromise on that in some way or compromise on how she currently lives/envisions how she\u2019ll live going forward.", "Rose needs to go to someone and learn to manage their money .

I felt no entitlement to their money whatsoever. They could have lined their casket with it for all I cared. But the constant favoritism to the one \u201cwho needed them more\u201d drove a real wedge in our relationship. They did that. Not my brother.", "Suggle75's parents *lied*, if they said they were going to make up for it with the inheritance and then didn't do it.  That's a good enough reason to be angry at them all by itself.  Then add on all of the favoritism toward their Golden Child son.", "I feel this way with my needier sister as the less needy sister.  \n\nPart of it for me is that I am nervous about my sibling coming to me for financial help when my parents are no longer around to bail her out.   I feel like it will be an easier boundary to say that I'm not giving her any of my own, actual money.  Ever.  My parents' money is theirs, not mine.  It's just easier if none of it *ever becomes mine.*  She can draw from my parents money (alive or dead) until it's gone.  And then that chapter is closed, and there's no more money.  It's a much more complicated boundary to stop bailing someone out than it is to never start in the first place.", "Oops, I'll admit I was so caught in my outrage that anyone would even consider it...I totally missed that OP was against it.", "Tori Spelling?", "This scenario would actually be fine with me. The younger daughter's kids actually exist. Helping young offspring get the best start is different to helping your adult children *have* offspring. \n\nIVF also isn't a guarantee. It's a very expensive gamble. It can be equal to letting tens of thousands of dollars down the drain, while siphoning that money towards existing children can guarantee you entry to a better school or better food and better living conditions.", "Same thought.  Mom has a gift wrapping room and the girl complained before the grave was dug.", "I don't see the logic here. You're just rewarding the less responsible people that have kids first.", "So you think that they would be \u201cthrowing the money away\u201d if they helped pay for IVF treatments???  Tell me you\u2019ve never had fertility issues without telling me you\u2019ve never had fertility issues.  My daughter is an IVF baby and if I literally had to light $100k on fire to have her again, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat.  You can\u2019t even imagine the price tag that comes with the dream of wanting children that you can\u2019t naturally have.  Then all the heartbreak and anxiety and emotions that come along with IVF.  So, instead of helping your child live out their biggest dream, you think that your other child should get a handout because they had it easy?  F all the way off.", "YTA x1000", "I think the waste part is because lilly has said she does not want/need the money. \n\nIt seems even OP thinks lilly will turn it down. It is not like they just promised it to lilly and took it away. \n\nI can see where the mom/wife is coming from. \n\nThe money OP/wife have earmarked to help a kid, that kid does not want it. The money could help the other kid right now. In the sense of the money being to help a kid, it would be a waste to hold on to that money and the kid ends up rejecting it.", "in this example there was no information suggesting the younger cousin was less responsible.", "You're helping your grandchildren.", "They've given a ton of money to Rose and her family. Giving them more is like other people have said, throwing good money after bad. They literally already gave her down payment money that she used on not-a-house. Maybe they can reconsider if she gets her act together. It's not like the money disappears into the nether if OP doesn't give it away right now."]}
