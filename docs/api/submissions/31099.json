So I agree with you. NTA \n\nIt\u2019s only fair to keep it for Lily, you never what life may throw at her.  Also I hope you and your wife keeps this discussion away from your daughters so it doesn\u2019t affect their relationship - unless you have away to ensure that Lily genuinely would be happy for you to give it away.", "NTA thats probably why rose is in the position shes in, cause you guys been enabling her", "So you want to punish one daughter, who has been financially responsible, and reward the other daughter, who's been living above her means for years and years. You're literally taking from one daughter to give to the other. How could you expect your relationship with your daughters to be unchanged, or their relationships with each other to be unchanged after this blatant favoritism?", "NTA, without spending changed, the money is only going to be a temporary shift.\n\nI think what you should offer to do though is use some of the money for her to go to a financial counselor or planner. (I\u2019m assuming she won\u2019t want your input)", "NTA\n\nHaving a child does use up quite a bit of a family\u2019s finances, but it sounds like Rose and her husband didn\u2019t do much to live within their means even before their child came along. \n\nYour wife clearly loves her children and grandchild, but not getting the exact home Rose and her husband want is not the same as having no home at all. They can rent or buy a lesser house and then save up to get the home they want. You contributed to Rose\u2019s wedding and it seems fair to offer to pay for lily\u2019s too. Save Lily\u2019s wedding money for her.", "NTA they haven\u2019t saved a penny in 10 years. Instead of throwing your money into the wind towards a home they can not afford, save it for your grandchild\u2019s college education.", "NTA Rose is in the position she's in due to her and her husband's financial decisions. I would hold onto the wedding fund until Lillys wedding is done and over with, so you still have that to offer. If she doesn't end up using it, then you can figure out how to use it to help out Rose. I wouldn't, however, just give Rose and her husband a check.", "NTA - if Lily turns down the wedding money save it for your future grandchildren,\nDo NOT give any more money to Rose.\nIf she has already blown through her inheritance she needs to learn how to live within her means.", "NTA. If you are constantly helping Rose out, you are enabling her poor choices and she will continue to rely on you forever. And your granddaughter isn't homeless.", "NTA:  But you even if Lily turns down the money you aren't doing Rose any favors.  This isnt the case of someone losing their job and struggling, or someone getting in debt after an injury or illness.  This is someone who lived outside of the means and never saved a dime in a decade.  \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if you continue having to bail her out if she doesn't learn how to be fiscally responsible adult.", "NTA - Your stance is the fair down the middle equal approach.\n\nThe only way that you can even consider gifting that money to Rose is if Lily is happy with it. \n\nEven then I don't know if there is a good way to approach such a conversation \"hey, you know how we had money set aside for your wedding? Well Rose really needs it so we are giving it to her instead. Yeah I know she already got her money but that's what your mother wants.\"\n\nI can't imagine it would go down well.

She likely knows there\u2019s a safety blanket there and doesn\u2019t feel the need to change her habits. \n\nI get costs. But that\u2019s why ppl claw back, or connect with a financial advisor and set up goals to work towards. It\u2019s not too late for her to do that, or can happen at any time. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t give them the money", "NTA - rose made her decision to have a child. She\u2019s also making financial decisions now. What\u2019s renting like where she\u2019s at? She needs to learn how to be financially responsible.\n\nShe gets more money, gets a bigger house. Can she afford it? Can she afford repairs?", "NTA.  However, if Lily turns down the money, I\u2019d put it into a college fund for Rose\u2019s daughter.  Do not give to Rose, she needs to learn to budget and live within her means.", "NTA. Your daughters should be equal in your eyes and wallets. They both made decisions that shape their current lives and it isn't fair to take away from Lily due to decisions made by Rose. Lily may change her mind later and it would be horrible to have to tell her that you gave her money to Rose even though Rose had already gotten money before. There's plenty of those stories on this site.", "NTA, they are irresponsible with their money, your choice is to use the money for them now or save it for a wedding. One way or another it sounds like you will let her have the money. If she uses it now, she pays for her own wedding.", "NTA. Taking the money earmarked for Lily's wedding and giving it to Rose is literally \"throwing the good money after the bad.\" The difference between the two sisters is not how much they earned but how well they manage what they have. Lily and her partner are financially savvy and responsible, and Rose and her husband are not. No matter how much money you give Rose, it will go to waste. Having a child your wife's been watching for free = no childcare expenses, so \"ahh, having a child is harder\" is just an excuse your wife has made up to guilt you. The child is also not homeless; they have a roof over their heads. You would not be the first set of parents who enable the less competent child at the expense of the more competent one, and this inequality and favoritism rarely if ever does any favors to the parents' relationship with the more capable (but less favored) child or the relationship between the siblings. Favoring the child who has a child of their own over the child who doesn't (at least not yet), same. What's fair is fair. Unfair doesn't become okay just because Rose spends all the money she gets her hands on.", "NTA\nI understand where your wife is coming from but I am not for people being punished for making good decisions.", "NTA. Instead of giving Rose cash, which she and her husband will likely either squander or run through in a big hurry, the best thing you and your wife can give Rose and her husband is ***sessions with a financial advisor***. It may be that Rose will need to wait a bit longer to buy a home, but until she and her husband are secure enough to know they will not need future help paying their mortgage, taxes or maintenance, they likely aren't ready to be homeowners.\n\nI am in no way saying this is anyone's fault. Some people are just better with money, less impulsive with their spending and more mindful of saving, and sometimes life just happens and you have costs like, well, expensive child care. But if Rose really wants to start getting ahead financially, it's not going to happen until she has a financial education and she and her husband change their spending habits and learn to stick to a budget which includes set-asides for emergencies and future plans (like a house or a college education).", "NTA. You literally say that Rose is financially irresponsible, and giving her money now would surely only encourage her to continue that trend. She's almost 30 and should know better.", "NTA.  Your grandchild isn't living on the streets.  She **has** a home, just not have the house Rose wants. Your wife hasn't figured out that Rose will go through that money like water and have her hand out for more before the ink is dry on the mortgage.  Nothing is making things harder on Rose except Rose and her husband.", "NTA, giving Rose more money is just rewarding her bad spending habits, whereas Lily has saved and lived within her means and should get the same as Rose. \n\nYou already said you've been helping out Rose financially, that is not fair to Lily even if she hasn't mentioned it. Rose needs to learn to live within her means.", "NTA. Do not give it over. Rose needs a reality check, not a bail out. And there will be a time Lily needs the money and will cause resentment if she doesn't get it.", "NAH - I would really confirm with Lilly that she does indeed not want to the money, and let her know you intend on giving it to her sister. It there\u2019s any hesitation, dont do it. But I would have some reservations about enabling Rose\u2019s poor financial planning by giving her the money.", "NAH.  From what it sounds like, Rose isn't asking you for more money.  Your wife naturally wants to help her child out.  You want to keep everything fair in case Lily eventually wants/needs the wedding money.  \n\n\nRose is going to have to learn some tough lessons.  She and her family CAN get a home, despite what your wife has said (you said she was approved for a certain amount).  It's just not going to be as big as Lily's.  And that's okay.  There's nothing wrong with getting a smaller house, especially if it's all they can afford.  As for the money for Lily's wedding, I would not give it to Rose, at least at this point.  Lily is saying she doesn't want/need it, but when the time comes to marry, perhaps she and her boyfriend will have a discussion and want to take that money.  If the time to marry comes and they don't want it, then put it in a trust for your grandkid.  Or save it for when Lily has a kid (if she plans on having kids).", "NTA - your only grandchild does have a home. Her parents just don't own it but they have a place to live. You will not be helping Rose to learn to live within her means if you keep giving her money. It's a hard lesson, but one that needs to be learned. (I was guilty of this myself but once I stopped helping, my son and his family learned to live within their means and are doing well.) Rose and her husband can look for a smaller house to start with and build up equity to eventually get a bigger one.  If Lily doesn't want the money for her wedding, save it for a college fund for your grandchild(ren). Otherwise, Bank of Mom and Dad will never close for Rose.", "Your wife is the AH. She is actively enabeling your oldest in her bad decisions. The child does not suffer from homelessness. She is almost 30. It's time to put some boundaries down. Stop helping her living over her means. Teach her the reality of life. Your eldest is clearly the golden child of your wife. You go Sir. Keep things equal. If your youngest doesnt want the money put it in a trust fund FOR HER FUTURE ( childrens or not). If the eldest cant budget it's not the youngest duty to sacrifice non stop for her.", "NAH. Your wife obviously wants what is best for all involved and since Lily doesn\u2019t want the money I can see her POV. However, I personally agree with your POV. It does feel like it would be enabling poor financial habits to give the money to Rose though.", "My mom is exactly like this. Lived outside of her means, never saved a dime. She\u2019s now 76 and I, her only child, am stuck footing the bill for her life. $2k/mo!!! OP, if you want to do Rose a favor, don\u2019t bail her out this time or in the future. If someone in my mom\u2019s life had forced her to figure things out and save, we might not be in this situation now. It will only get worse.", "Lily is only 24. she hasn't gotten married (yet). So she has no need for the wedding fund money right now. But that doesn't mean it should be given away. A lot of things can happen before she is ready to get married, which may mean she would accept the wedding fund money. And then what she's out of luck because her sister doesn't know how to save. \n\nIt's money earmarked for lily. Rose is mismanaged her money that doesn't mean she gets lily's earmarked money. Nor does it mean it gets given away to roses kid.", "Absolutely. Lilly needs to know before you give it away. It's not her fault that Rose & her husband live above their means and do not save. The grandchild has a home, just not a the home the parents want. Don't punish Lilly for being financially responsible."]}
