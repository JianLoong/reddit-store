Ultimately 14 is old enough to decide for herself, but it\u2019s incredibly immature of you to bribe her into staying away from family.\n\nETA: if you want to provide a loving and supportive home to her, whilst things are hard with her mom, the last thing you should be doing is creating conflict in the form of bribing a 14 year old to stay away from her family\u2019s Christmas celebration. \n\nShe will remember this as another slight by the adults in her life. Just give her the console and say it\u2019s no strings attached. Things are hard enough already. Being a displaced teenager is awful.", "So she wanted to go home, her family wanted her to go home and you bought her to stay with you over Christmas for a gaming system ?\n\nYour intentions are good, you don\u2019t want to see her suffer, no question. But yes, YTA. Your niece is upset over favouritism and I do not condone her mother\u2019s behaviour, but taking away Christmas preventively doesn\u2019t sound like a great solution. She still loves her siblings. It would be the first Christmas of her new sibling too. If she feels like an outsider now, imagine after big holidays are spent without her.\n\nIt\u2019s better to compensate in this case. Send her out for Christmas, make it known that she\u2019s free to come back anytime she wants if it doesn\u2019t go well and plan your own Christmas celebration for when she comes back. And if it goes wrong, don\u2019t let her go next big event.\n\nIt really depends on the treatment she receives though. If it\u2019s to abuse level, don\u2019t let her go of course. But from your post, it doesn\u2019t sound like it.", "Info: is she upset after going home because she\u2019s treated poorly or because there is a new baby and dynamics have changed?\n\nI gotta ask because a new baby often means the older siblings get less attention for awhile and the parents are stressed but that does not make them bad or mean parents.", "Hmm. \n\nActually I think you should have a proper chat with your niece, ask her how she feels. \n\nWould it be better if you invited her mum and the new family for a visit (maybe not for Xmas) instead of her going over - that way she gets both her mum and someone standing by her if she gets bullied, also, she gets \u201chome ground\u201d advantage.\n\nI did put NTA in one of the comments above, I still think that but maybe bribery isn\u2019t a good way forward.", "So mom was having a difficult pregnancy and couldn\u2019t take care of her 14 year old daughter, but I\u2019m assuming the younger kids from her new family stayed? Her daughter is not some seasonal ornament to have only at Christmas. There\u2019s so much more going on and this poor girl has to suffer because of incompetent adults. OP means well, but do right by this kid, not just bribery for an easy out. Legal custody needs to be addressed and mom needs to be held accountable. This poor girl.

I get that going home upsets her, but if she wants to see her family regardless I think it's important to let her decide and just be a supportive safe place to come home to when it goes to shit.\n\nI love that you got her something she really wanted for Christmas, and I get you're trying to protect her (hence NTA) - but I dont think it should have been a bribe. I think it should be a gift of love with no conditions. \n\nEither way, i wish her the best.", "Soft YTA. It seems to me that you\u2019re trying to protect this girl and that you really care about her well-being, but you made a deal with her mother and you should honor it. It\u2019s clear that your heart is in in the right place, but you bribed her and that\u2019s pretty manipulative.", "NTA - your motives are good but handling it in a roundabout way is guaranteed to cause conflict. The kid's mother can see you went behind her back to entice her daughter to spend Christmas with you. I think it's good that you are trying to help your niece in a tough situation, but going behind the mother's back like this could submarine everything you're trying to do. It might be time to address the elephant in the room.", "NTA having been in the situation myself, I only wanted to go home because I continuously held onto hope that seeing me after X amount of time would change the way I was treated. It didn\u2019t. Oh there were hugs and smiles the first few minutes (for show imo) but as soon as the initial welcome \u201chome\u201d was over, I was the maid and the punching bag. \nThank you for caring about this young lady whom I feel definitely needs a strong support system and I feel you\u2019re doing all you can to support her.", "YTA. You\u2019re very vague about her mistreatment. For all we know, she\u2019s upset that there\u2019s a new baby at home and the attention is less on her. That\u2019s normal and not mistreatment. \n\nUnless there is actual abuse in the household, the decision where she stays for Christmas is up to her mother. You cannot just make decisions about where she stays as if you are her legal guardian. \n\nIf you\u2019re so concerned that she\u2019ll have a terrible Christmas with her family, why not celebrate Christmas with her early? Let her have two Christmases. Buy her that gaming system with no strings attached. Don\u2019t use bribery to get her to stay with you.", "YTA. Wow. Did you really just bribe her into staying with you, just because you selfishly didn't want her to go see her own mom? \n\nDon't you think at 14 she's old enough to make her own decisions?", "Yta\n\nYou should have given her the option and let her decide, she\u2019s old enough to know what she wants. Bribing her isn\u2019t the answer, are you going to do it every time she\u2019s supposed to go home?", "NTA. You honestly thought the best for your niece and prevented her Christmas from getting ruined. Giga move tbh. However, you should have a talk with her and ask her why she is always so upset and figure out how she is being mistreated. If it is physical, you should lawyer up as well", "Welp I know this is going to get downvoted but NTA overall because you just want your niece to have a good, stress free Christmas. However, bribing her is where you crossed the AH line. Back up, talk to your niece, and give her the option to see her fam if she wants to... all while knowing that sweet gaming system will be there waiting for her when she gets back. This one hits home for me as I grew up with 3 siblings and treated differently also. I'm truly hoping your niece has a very Merry Christmas OP, wherever SHE decides to spend it.", " I get what you are trying to and look at your nieces best interest, however, don\u2019t agree about using game system for Christmas without visit her mum and siblings.\n\nI think you need to have a clear discussion with your niece about why she is always upset when she comes home from her mothers. Is it about the new baby or if her mothers behaviour is that negative, is she experiencing being emotional abuse, get clear info about the way she is treated compared to other siblings.\n\nI think there needs to clear discussion with your niece about what she wants long term and why as she is old enough to know her own wishes. Making it clear that if she doesn\u2019t want to go back and live with her mother, doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love her mum and sibling. \n\nBut you need to have clear discussions on the reasons, discussing the next steps with her is and if she makes that decision not return permanently, including her mother in constructive conversation about the whole situation and maybe going forward whatever that looks like.\n\nYour NTA, just not approaching this in quite the way and this causing the friction between you and her mother.", "YTA. If something unsafe is happening, go through the courts and get legal physical custody and guardianship. If you keep her without permission, her mom could call the cops on you for kidnapping. Don't bribe her to stay. Figure out what's going on and be an adult about how you handle it.", "YTA for bribing a teenager who is going through familial issues in order to spend time away from her family. \n\nIt's hard to feel rejected and unwanted by your parents, and you're making matters worse by showing her conditional love through weird power-play gift giving.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s obvious you\u2019re trying to protect your niece the best way you can. However, you shouldn\u2019t encourage separation of the siblings and even if she is upset I think she should still go see them when she can. Separation from siblings can create a self identity crisis for some people later", "NTA overall I think. I see why you did what you did. Was it the best way to do it? Probably not. But in terms of trying to protect her from the pain and suffering she has from each time she goes over there, I understand it. It may be a good idea to sit her down and really investigate what's going on at her moms that she feels the way she does, whether it's neglect, parentification, abuse, favoritism, etc. She's 14, and old enough to really work through these things if you have her trusting you with this information. Maybe look into custody, if that's an option, although I can honestly say I have no idea how that works, so please take that with a grain of salt. I wish you well in navigating these difficult waters. Be careful and watch your own back as well. This can be turned against you rather easily. \n\nJust to put it out there, morally you doing this \"bribery\" primarily out of interest of your niece's feelings is what makes you NTA in my opinion. Obviously as long as there are no ulterior motives. \n\nLegally however, I'd guess you're in a weird spot, although it may depend on the laws in your area.", "Hard NTA. Her trips home are causing her pain and you saw that. If you weight her incentive for wanting to go back to mom and sibs as homesickness, all you did is put a PS5 on your side of the scale. All's fair too, because you are family, and niece is the one who decided she'd rather stay. I think deep down she knows it'll be painful to go home, so you gave her a nice out. Well done OP.", "YTA\n\nShe needs to be able to make choices about seeing her family. Of course she gets upset, that\u2019s the nature of being separated from them. It sounds like you want to avoid dealing with her feelings, rather than protecting her.", "NTA. The console for her is nice but I think you get to the most important meat of the issue. Getting permanent legal guardianship and telling her you don\u2019t want her Christmas ruined again. That her mom won\u2019t change and will keep treating her like shit. So please have Christmas with those who love you. And then therapy for her", "YTA- read up on normal behavior in a foster situation. It\u2019s expected that the kid will be upset after a family visit, that is normal emotional processing. I get that you didn\u2019t mean to be an AH and you feel like you\u2019re saving both of you anguish\u2026 but you\u2019re saving 14yr old her and current you, 30yr old her will wish she had been with her family on Christmas.", "NTA The kid obviously doesn't want to go home to her mom and she should have a choice", "YTA gently, I understand you have good intentions \n\nStop treating her like she is 5 and try having a conversation with her. What's her feelings, bribing her isn't the answer. \n\nBe constructive and understand if things are that bad she will stop wanting to go home her self. But it will take time as she needs to learn just because they are family doesn't mean they are great people. So far all you have done is perpetuate the situation and confuse her. \n\nGaming money might be better spent seeing a therapist.", "YTA for how you went about it. Would it be possible for an adult to go with her for a few days to see what is happening? Instead of avoiding the contact try to see if it can be fixed.", "YTA\n\nBribing to stay for gaming console?!? Seriously?!? Of course she wants to stay!!", "YTA for going back on your word without a better reason than the one you give.", "Assuming your niece agreed because she's fully on board with missing the drama and not because she felt coerced or obligated, then I don't think YTA here. It sounds like you have good intentions; that you're trying to protect her, her mental and emotional well-being. You're trying to keep her out of a crappy situation. It might suck from the mother's point of view, but that's too bad. If her daughter didn't come back every time, upset, then this wouldn't be an issue. How does your niece feel about this? What did she think/say? Is she totally okay with this? If she was totally excited at the idea of not having to deal with that, you NTA here.", "YTA\n\nYou are bribing a child with toys to keep her away from her mother. No matter what you think about the situation you are way out of order here.", "YTA and your comments prove you're a bigger AH it's her choice, not a choice that you get to bribe her into, it's unfair and it's making you just as bad as her mother, apparently she has zero carers looking out for her now", "\"I made an agreement.

If you're OK with that, then, OK I guess.\n\nAnd (2) there is SOOO much more going on here than is in your post.  Does Sis have a man?  How does he feel about niece?  Why does Sis favor the other kids?  Is mom actually mean to niece or does niece just find it a pain being in a house with a new baby?

It's nothing to do with it your niece is upset or not, it's the fact you have to deal with her being upset.", "And she's not upset missing xmas with her siblings and mother?", "Yes", "Pmsl wish mine were that easy to bribe\ud83e\udd23", "But she only bribed her because she didn't want her to go to a situation that she knows will leave her in the dumps because she hopes things will be different sometimes.\n\nA teenager also has problems knowing when a situation is no longer benefiting them and the best time to back away from it. She made that decision easier for her this time. \n\nMaybe next year when the baby is a little older and the mother can pull her attention away a little more things won't be like this.\n\nNTA.", "I was talking about my own daughter dude", "He compared his daughter to his niece about choosing the gaming system over staying with family, not calling his niece his daughter.", "The younger boys get more allowance because they think boys need more money.\n\nThey took her phone away once and after I couldn't contact her I called her mom just to find out she has been grounded because her mom found out she has a boyfriend\n\nIs that enough?", "She is a kid. Of course she wants to go to her mom no matter how she is. She still got to decide I just made the decision easier for her", "What is she gonna do about it? She can barely handle 3 kids if she sues me she has to take care of 4 without any help", "Let me remove that.\n\nActually I don\u2019t know but I read that it\u2019s the case.", "Not saying I agree with OP\u2019s methods, but their intentions aren\u2019t wrong. The daughter deserves better than to be treated like she\u2019s disposable when her presence is deemed inconvenient. And less than simply due to being born the wrong sex according to her mother\u2019s backwards views. There\u2019s a huge difference between not liking someone\u2019s parenting methods and protecting a child from mistreatment. OP said in another comment the mother isn\u2019t receptive to hearing how her bullshit is negatively impacting her daughter.", "This is important information I recommend you add this and how she has felt from before, you might get a different opinion on what you\u2019ve done.", "Yea. That seems awful. What could her YOUNGER brothers need more money for? That\u2019s crazy. The bf thing is sad too.", "Wow. Very clear NTA. Her \u201cmother\u201d is failing her every chance she gets, good on you for providing a space where the girl can feel safe and loved. Some people shouldn\u2019t be parents.", "Honestly, it sucks but until your niece is old enough to chose to leave, or unless her parents wants nothing to do with her, you don't have a legal leg to stand on, you mentioned she can't sue but you can certainly go to jail for kidnapping, parents even have grounds for a restraining order if you keep pushing, especially when the abuse you mentioned, while it is abuse, it is not enough to remove a child from their parents.\n\nThe best thing you can do is be the cool/fun/safe uncle/aunt and always keep your door open and check in often with texts and calls, make sure she knows she has a safe place to go if things go from bad to worse and guide her through the crap. Tread lightly.", "This is not the kind of thing you manipulate a kid over. You promise a kid a new gaming system if they get good grades, not if they avoid family they are close with. Just ask her what she wants to do and let her do it, if she says she wants to go, that's her decision to make.", "No. You bribed her to as you wish. That's manipulative and selfish and indeed makes YTA", "You didn't make the decision easier for her.  You manipulated her into staying with you instead of finding a mature solution to sort this out.", "Bribery doesn\u2019t make decision making easier, it just leaves the person feeling guilty no matter what option they choose. YTA", "No you manipulated her.  If you have concerns about how her mum treats her when there talk your niece, talk to her mum, get her therapy, hell even call CPS if it's safe to do so. What you're doing is going to add to her issues, whether it's now or in later life.", "Just wanted to establish whether you're okay with kidnapping on your record. \n\nAnd maybe don't act so high and mighty when you admit you've been no help to your niece nor your former SIL for the last 13 years.", "When people kidnap your child you don't sue them. You have them arrested for kidnapping. I believe that's a felony. Your niece will have to tell the court that you bribed her to stay. If you're a man, bribing a 14-year-old girl with a video game system is going to look very bad and likely involve more than just kidnapping charges. Even if you're a woman you can be charged. Send your niece home. If you truly want to help her, get her some appointments with a counselor.\n\nHow old does she have to be to be emancipated? If you can support her emotionally until she can legally make the decision, without being bribed, you could offer her real help. If her mother gets her back and won't let her return, you will have lost all opportunity to do anything for her. You have to think long-term and be smart about this.", "oh, okay.", "And who is gonna take care of her daughter when I'm in jail? My niece will never say that"]}
