My fiance was married to 'Amy'(34F) before me and they had a son together 'Jay'(17F). Amy and Alan slept together at a party when they were both 16 and jay was the product of that. They tried their best to make it work for 5 years but then got divorced as Amy had cheated on Jay. \n\nNow coming to the issue, I met my husband when I was 25 and he was 28. That's nearly 6-7 years after his divorce with Amy. But Jay seemed to think of me as the cause of it. Alan and Amy have decided to not tell Jay about the real reason of their divorce until he's legally an adult. Because of that, he seems to believe that if he pushes his father and mother together, they'll get back together. \n\nI have nothing against Jay but his actions really hurt me and he's so full of hatred for me. Intially, I tried to be a second mom to him but he didn't like it nor did Amy, which I understand. So I stopped trying and treated him as a friend instead. But he talks down to me, calls me homewrecker. But, last week  his friends all messaged me harassing me and asking to send them my OF(which I don't have) since I'm a thot and alot of other explicit things. This has hit the nail in the coffin for my fiance. \n\nMy fiance is furious at Jay and wants to uninvite him from our wedding, so do I. but Amy is against that.

He's 17 and Alan and Amy still haven't told him why they divorced? He is far too old for this behavior to be understandable. If your fiance allows you to be treated this way now, it will only get worse once you're married. Alan needs to fix this.", "This is not normal teen behavior and the parents should talk with him NOW! How in the world can your partner keep this happening. Telling Jay now at 17 instead of 18 doesn\u2018t make a difference in maturity.", "NtA. He's 17. He's old enough to know right from wrong.  \n\nAnd he should know the real reason for the divorce already. \n\nHe's harassing you and you're supposed to turn the other cheek?  \n\nAlan should have stopped protecting Amy a long time ago. Hltheu both enabled jay to keep treating you this.\n\nNtA", "NTA.  Until his mother owns up to the real reason they parted, you'll continue to be the bad guy in this situation.  You've tried to form a relationship and Jay isn't interested, choosing to hate you without having all the facts.\n\nPersonally, I don't think you should ban him from the wedding.  I think there should be an invite and he should be told you both want him to be there but, if he feels too uncomfortable or, if he can't be there and be happy for you, he can choose not to attend and there'll be no repercussions.  Then it's his choice and not something you're forcing on him.\n\nHe already thinks you're the reason his parents aren't together.  If you tell him he can't attend, he'll also think you're trying to come between him and his dad.  You're not, I know but he has this twisted view of you and banning him will only make it worse.", "NTA for not wanting him at the wedding, HOWEVER, it would be nice if you could come to some resolution about the main issue which is the son believing you wrecked his parent's marriage. He's almost an adult so he's old enough to learn the truth. Having said that, the other option is for his father to make it very clear to him that you were not anything to do with it. I'm not sure why you are being left to carry the burden of blame when a simple \"{wife} wasn't even around then, I didn't meet her until 5 years later. Your mother and I are not compatible and are never getting back together again regardless of if I ever remarried or not\". The kid needs to be told to stop treating you like this. It's not acceptable.", "NTA.  His parents have been divorced 70% of this kids life.  And at the time you met, about 60%.  The kid has serious issues to hold on to this for this long in this manner.\n\nYou should not have to deal with this but I would take a long hard look at who you are marrying given that he has allowed his child to get to this point.  Maybe he tried everything and the kid is seriously mentally ill.   But this kid needed help years ago.  His attitude towards you can\u2019t be his only issue, with his reaction being so unreasonable.  \n\nI don\u2019t think telling the kid about his moms affair right now is the best advice.  I would get some professional advice before dropping any more bombshells on a kid who is already troubled.  Furthermore I assume you only have your fianc\u00e9s word about the reason for the divorce.  It may be more complicated than you realize.", "NTA Amy does like to have her cake and eat it too. Wouldn't really be surprised if all the hatred that your stepson has for you really comes from her. Delaying telling him what actually happen for the break up has probably allowed her to hint at Alan cheating with you rather than her cheating on him.", "NTA, 17 is old enough to understand what's appropriate and what's not\n Do not have him at your wedding, he will make sure to ruin it.\nAnd Amy can go and have him at her wedding. Why does she have any say in yours?", "Why you would marry into animosity is beyond me. Just because he knows about the real reason his parents aren\u2019t together it doesn\u2019t erase how he has treated you.", "NTA but are you sure you want to be  with a guy who won't tell his son the truth resulting to you being treated badly?", "NTA You have a fiance problem as much as a stepson problem\n\n\nThe wedding should not continue until Jay knows the truth. Why would you stay with a man who lets his son treat you like that when you did nothing wrong? This should have been stopped when it started.", "NTA because his dad feels the same way as you. Ultimately though if the groom wants his son there, and there\u2019s a good chance he will, then you will have to support that decision", "NTA his parents a need to be honest with him. He\u2019s old enough and since it has been 5 years it makes me wonder why he things your the home wrecker. But he\u2019s also a kid and it sounds like the adults in his life are failing him by allowing him to be an ass.", "NTA I don't think that is normal teen behaviour", "NTA, this is on your man and his ex", "NTA i would die of cringe if i were texting that stuff to another classmate parent", "NTA - You and Alan need to sit down with Jay and let him know the real reason for the divorce.  Amy doesn't want you to tell because then he'll be furious with her for cheating.\n\nYou are doing him no favors by hiding the truth, which will come out and cause even more problems when he blames you for not telling him.\n\nTell him the truth and if that doesn't change his mind, don't invite him to the wedding, he's bound to cause a disruption.", "Nta, but as much as you may love your fiancee, it may not be worth marrying him. If this hasn't been resolved by now, it probably never will be. You're not going to win Jay over, and your fiancee won't have your back. I think that kind of friction and lack of support eventually white ants most relationships.", "NTA - I would say that it's important for your fiance's son to be there, but Jay has already gone too far. He might ruin your wedding if he goes. Your fiance needs to sit Jay down and make it clear that he's NEVER getting back together with his ex no matter what Jay does and that the reason will be explained when he turns 18. I personally think he's old enough to handle the truth and don't think that your fiance should wait until he and his ex set a time to tell him the truth together. The ex might be getting ready to tell a story that is in her favor. If she were a good person, she would have told Jay the truth so that he would stop making your life so difficult. Why is she minimizing Jay's bad behavior?", "INFO how do you see this relationship working out? Sure, you ban him from the wedding but after that, are you going to ban him from his dad's house? What happens if the harassment escalates? Do you plan on having kids? What happens if Jay takes his anger out on your kids?\n\nHave you all tried family therapy?", "NTA but you have a fiance problem. His son is definitely out of line however Jay is going off the only information he has. His dad needs to tell him why his parents divorced. He's 17 and that's old enough to know the truth. If it damages his relationship with one or both parents then they need to deal with it. Until he tells his son the truth then he shouldn't be at this wedding or you need to reconsider this relationship.", "NTA - for obvious reasons, he is 17.  He should know better and the OF stuff was cruel and I would argue sexual harassment or sexist.  If you invite him, he will mess up your wedding.   I wouldn\u2019t but if you do, I\u2019d make it clear worth the dad you should tell him(and follow through) you\u2019ll go NC if he misbehaves.\n\nPersonally, he probably wants them to get back together and is blaming you for stopping that, but phrasing it as your a home wrecker.  Might be better to have Alan explain the fact his mom cheated and there\u2019s no going back.\n\nINFO - I\u2019m assuming Alan has sat down and explained you weren\u2019t at fault.  Does he know his mom cheated?  Also do you know if Amy is lying to him?  Could amy be feeding this fantasy to try to keep Alan single?", "ESH --- I think your fiance needs to have a sit-down and have a talk with his son, first he needs to ask him if he has any idea why he and his mother divorced then he needs to be completely honest with him and tell him the truth then that's up to Jay to how he reacts and what he does with that information.", "Do you really want to marry someone who's (*almost*) adult kid has hated you from the start of the relationship? Your fianc\u00e9 is a parent first and parenting doesn't stop when someone turns 18. Uninviting him from the wedding will make the problem worse not solve the issue.

Parent their child 2. Get him into therapy", "NTA for being upset with how Jay is acting but your fianc\u00e9 and Amy are definitely TA for not telling Jay the truth. I think this has nothing to do with the wedding but everything to do with the fact that Jay\u2019s parents are willfully keeping him in the dark. Jay is 17 years old, he\u2019s only 1 year away from being a legal adult. That\u2019s close enough. This is all stemming from Amy not wanting to look like the bad guy. I would allow Jay to come to the wedding but I\u2019d give your fianc\u00e9 and Amy a choice. They can either tell Jay the truth (with plenty of time for him to absorb this knowledge before the wedding) and he can come to the wedding; or if they don\u2019t tell him the truth, he won\u2019t be invited to the wedding and when he turns 18 years old, they now have to tell him not only was his Mother a cheater.. but his parents keeping this truth from him, led to the resentment that caused him to miss his own Father\u2019s wedding. Alan needs to stop worrying about protecting Amy and start worrying about telling his son the truth and taking away his sons ammunition to hate you. Word to the wise, if they do tell him the truth, don\u2019t hover but let Jay know you\u2019re there if he wants someone to talk to that\u2019s not his parents. Jay has been shitty to you, no denying that. But he\u2019s 17 years old and thought he was helping his Mom.", "Nope you are not the asshole. I would invite him under the condition that his parents sit down with him and clear this mess which is their doing.You shouldnt be paying for something totaly unrelated to you.They need to tell him what hapened and why.He needs to aplogize.I woudnt have him at the wedding without that.Why.Because he can wreck your day with his spite and antics.", "The person to un-invite to the wedding  is Alan.\n\nAlan and ex are still raging. He obeys her at cost to you. You deserve better than this mess. Move on. ESH  edit word", "NTA. The fault is squarely on the parents, theyre the ones indulging this crap and making you pay for their decision of not telling him.", "NTA something tells me some of what he's saying is coming from his mum", "This kid needs help.

He's almost an adult this is the last chance dad has to get him therapy and away from his peer group.", "NTA.  But they need to tell Jay why his parents really broke up. He's old enough to understand and\nhe's harassing you because he doesn't understand.  Your fiance and his ex are absolutely the AH for allowing this to continue and not telling their son the truth.", "NTA this situation cannot go on. the kid is 17 tell him the dam truth they are idiots for waiting this long it will hit him like a ton of bricks. once he turns 18 you need to tell him if he does not respect you he is not welcome in your home.", "NTA but your fianc\u00e9 absolutely is TA.\n\nJay has been lied to his whole life.

You are right that he has a right to be in the wedding. \nAlso know that,once he knows the truth, he'll regret his actions and will resent everyone who has kept the truth away from him. 17 years old is big enough to handle this information.  What guarantees you that your fianc\u00e9e will eventually tell him the truth. You'll be married to him and yet his son won't even respect you. Are you ready for this?. As his future wife,he should ensure that his son respects you and knows the truth. \nTell Jay the truth infront of Alan so that he can't deny it . If he denies it,then walk away from that relationship", "ESH. Not telling a teenager the truth about why their marriage broke up is borderline abusive.  It certainly doesn't help anything.  It's not Jay's fault his parents have been lying to him.  Now you see the consequences.", "Amy has no say in whether Jay goes to your wedding. She has no say on anything that happens within your household. She has a say on how to discipline her child for his actions which she can discuss with his father. \n\nYou however, do have a say. If your fianc\u00e9 supports the decision then do not have him at the wedding. I suggest fianc\u00e9 and you have a sit down discussion with Jay. Record the discussion so he can hear back is words and so Amy an stfu about being too sensitive. Jay is almost 18 and has shown zero respect or responsibility for is actions. In the real world not the La la land Amy apparently is raising her son in there are consequences for actions. \n\nJay has chosen to disrespect you multiple times. He has chosen to disrespect his fathers relationship and his own relationship with his dad by doing what he is doing. What happens if you have children will Jay be horrible to them ? What will be the excuse then ? \n\nIt\u2019s time for serious conversations your fianc\u00e9 needs to step up and have some serious and hard conversations with his son. And he is going to have to do it without Amy because truthfully she is probably the one feeding Jay all these horrible things about you \n\nBest of luck", "NTA but I would hope there's a better solution than uninviting him to the wedding.  I'm not sure how a 17 year old can think you ruined his parents' marriage when you and Alan didn't meet until years afterwards.  That sounds pretty stupid.  Alan needs to have a man to man talk with Jay about family and relationships and respect.  Jay has to know that whether or not he wants to view you as a mother figure, as Alan's new wife, he can't treat you like this. \n\nThis is why we come to reddit, better than any daytime tv show", "NTA, do not marry Jay until he has been told about the actual reason for the divorce.  ultimatium time.", "I hate to say this, but it is way past time to tell Jay the truth about why his parents divorced.  They also need to stop coddling him.  This is beyond normal teenage behavior niw   NTA for not wanting him there, but you bith will be if you go through with it.  The kid already has enough anger issues.  Excluding him like that will only make it worse.  His father needs to tell him the truth before you two get married, and he also needs to put his foot down with Amy about not helping smooth out the angry issues.  If I was a betting woman I would bet Amy is putting things in Jay's head to help stroke his anger, and behavior.  Especially with her reaction to his friend's behavior.  Just my personal thoughts though.  I could be wrong.", "NTA\n\nTell Alan that the wedding is on hold until Jay knows the truth about the divorce. However the ingrained habit of hating you almost certainly won't go away. Think carefully before you proceed.", "I\u2019m not sure what effect telling the son the truth would have now. It\u2019s likely he either won\u2019t believe it or will be angry at his mum for letting him believe lies for all these years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTbh they were 16 when he was born. That\u2019s it really. How many teen parents are still together after having an unplanned child at a young age? I would think that that is reason enough that his bio parents split without chucking in the \u201cfacts\u201d that a lot of people probably wouldn\u2019t want to hear about their parents sex lives.   \n\n\nHis parents were young and things didn\u2019t work out. Years later his dad met someone new and that\u2019s that.   \n\n\nHas his mum never dated anyone else since his dad? Surely the son is aware that couples don\u2019t always stay together forever.   \n\n\nI would question why the fiance is so desperate to please the ex wife at the soon to be wife\u2019s expense.", "Info: Ever think that maybe Amy told Jay the reason for the divorce but switched it saying Alan was the one who cheated??", "Alan for sure has.  He chooses not to believe it.  Now if Amy is lying that\u2019s another matter, but he is 17 and she is completely independent actor.\n\nHe has chosen to blame her, logic won\u2019t work", "It's reasonably likely the ex fed this fire.\n\nRegardless, kid needs to be told the truth. It may not fix things, but withholding the truth has certainly created a very poor result.", "I agree it\u2019s on Jay\u2019s parents to fix this. Not inviting him will only reinforce Jay\u2019s views about OP. It won\u2019t matter if the dad agrees with her.  Jay will see it as OP fault  he\u2019s not invited. It might even escalated to NC and resentments. The parents need to tell Jay the truth if it\u2019s important for the dad to have a relationship with Jay.", "Jay is 17, he's more than old enough to know why things ended, he should have been told years ago but Amy was probably hoping if they put it off for years they'd forget about it.", "This is a very thoughtful response. If you want any kind of relationship with this kid, don\u2019t uninvite him.", "Alan isn't hiding anything. Alan, I and Amy have had several sit down conversations about Jay's behaviour and Amy's infidelity has been discussed. Alan has brought up telling Jay what happened years back but Amy shuts it down.

However I think now he needs to tell Jay the truth otherwise the situation may spiral more.", "It is worth marrying him. He's a wonderful man and I don't want to lose him because of his son. He's so perfect and he has punished Jay for his actions and has had sit down convo's with Amy to sort out the issue but it always ends up with Amy shutting down every suggestion with the excuse that Jay is still young and a stupid teen.", "I am pregnant right now and that was also a reason why Alan didn't want Jay to attend & cause me stress. I don't think Jay would ever harm kids. And we've done seperate counselling sessions (besides Jay) but not family therapy because Jay's mom doesn't believe in therapy.", "Personally, if it was me, I wouldn't get into this mess.

I am telling him the truth tonight, I suggest you prepare yourself for the questions and hurt our son will have.\u201d Or something like that. Either way Jay needs to know the truth.", "Kid is also crap at maths if he can\u2019t work out his parents split years before you came on the scene, he\u2019s taking his anger out on you and once you are married to his dad you can expect his behaviour to get even worse, he\u2019s using words now to hurt you in the hope you\u2019ll leave his father but when you\u2019re married he could become physically abusive in an attempt to ramp up his campaign to get rid of you", "Well its not up to Amy is it.She is holding you hostage and your husband is puting up with it.You need to solve this before the marriage.Good luck.", "Fair enough, you know the situation better than a random internet stranger. Could you live with the current situation? Because it's a very real concern that Jay never changes his attitude towards you. I was fortunate in that I've always had a really good relationship with my steps from day one, but I don't think my husband and I would have gotten to an engagement, let alone marriage, if they'd been hostile to me.
