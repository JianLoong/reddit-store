Also being kind is dangerous these days. Your intent could be 100% to help yet someone could easily misinterpret that as something more sinister. You did the right thing by removing yourself from all of that. If she didn't want to fall she should've not run and looked where she was going. But then kids are kids and they learn their lessons the hard way.", "NTA.  She's a bratty kid who did something foolish and paid the price.  I'm in my fifties, overweight, and have really bad knees.

I\u2019m baffled by the number of people who are confused/grossed out by OP mentioning it because it seems like a pretty obvious reason why a man in his 40s would go out of his way to avoid making physical contact with her, with or without the added threat of an elbow jab to the gut.", "Bingo", "Read this guy's post history.

I get where you\u2019re coming from, but that line of thinking is also the exact reason why he dodge and felt he should mention it so people didn\u2019t think he was an apathetic AH who didn\u2019t care if a kid got hurt", "I think he caused less damage by moving out of the way also her parents should\u2019ve been watching her.
