After a while, she asked for it back...and I'm still embarrassed that I held onto it for so long.  Sorry Mum!", "NTA. Ask for the tools you need It has been a long enough for him to finish the house. And you provided 50K. There is nothing wrong asking for what you need, either all at once, or a few things at a time.", "Just borrow a few things and return them periodically as you borrow new things. Make it clear that you\u2019re just trying to find things to do and that the tools are definitely his. This will also give you a chance to maybe still build some things for your son inside his home (making up for lost time).", "You would be NTA in my opinion. But that makes little difference in your life. What matters is how your son views you. In his view, taking your tools back will make you TA. Start buying some replacement tools. There\u2019s some bargains to be found on the auction site and the jungle site. Maybe you could go and help your son work on his house. Even doing light work together is an opportunity to bond.", "It was a gift not a loan, YWBTA if you asked for them back", "A very light YWBTA. Your son grew up without a dad and he feels entitled to **something** to compensate for that, whether it was your fault or not. Then several unfortunate circumstances lined up, and now he has your tools. Unless you can physically help him complete his house and rebuild a relationship and trust with him, you have to chalk those tools up to a loss, I\u2019m afraid. I would see if there are local woodworkers in your area that are selling their tools, or a place you can go and borrow tools as you need them and slowly rebuild your collection. Asking for them back will just ruin your relationship, bc it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019ll give them back either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are there other solutions?\n\nYou so deserve things in life that bring you joy and you deserve to be able to woodwork. You would not be the asshole to get the tools back but if you want to maintain your relationship with your son proceed with sensitivity and lots of deliberation.

You couldn't help your son due to medical reasons but he was not ok with that. Feeling equal to stepbrother was more important than your health?\n\nThe help your son needs is not from you but from a therapist. He seems self absorbed. He must get exactly the same, no matter the cost. Why would he be angry 3 years later and the tools are not his?", "NTA.  Just ask for them back.  My father and I loan each other tools and lawn equipment all the time and never remember (or bother) to give them back when done with them, and neither of us have an issue with asking the other for one of them back when we want/need it.", "Was that an expectation, or actually discussed?", "Hey bro, can I borrow your flashlight really quick?

You loaned them to him, and have every right to expect to get them back if you now need them after he had them longer than anticipated.  You shouldn't have to do without when you have a need for them, especially when that need is driven by grief, and one would hope he would understand that.", "NTA, but count the tools as a 'gift' to your son and move on.  If you want to, buy some new woodworking tools and resume your hobby.", "Same - OPs son could well be under the impression they were gifted to him.\n\nI think NTA, but it makes it a bit more complicated feelings wise.\n\nAlthough the son getting arsey cos OP couldn't build his home anymore due to a *broken back* is a bit mad.", "You said, you have time. Have you ever asked him if you can assist him with the building even though you are not able to do heavy liftings etc? Maybe he needs someone with experience to go on with the building and hoped, you would help with that?"]}
