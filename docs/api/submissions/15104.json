After a while, she asked for it back...and I'm still embarrassed that I held onto it for so long.  Sorry Mum!", "NTA. Ask for the tools you need It has been a long enough for him to finish the house. And you provided 50K. There is nothing wrong asking for what you need, either all at once, or a few things at a time.", "Just borrow a few things and return them periodically as you borrow new things. Make it clear that you\u2019re just trying to find things to do and that the tools are definitely his. This will also give you a chance to maybe still build some things for your son inside his home (making up for lost time).", "You would be NTA in my opinion. But that makes little difference in your life. What matters is how your son views you. In his view, taking your tools back will make you TA. Start buying some replacement tools. There\u2019s some bargains to be found on the auction site and the jungle site. Maybe you could go and help your son work on his house. Even doing light work together is an opportunity to bond.", "It was a gift not a loan, YWBTA if you asked for them back", "A very light YWBTA. Your son grew up without a dad and he feels entitled to **something** to compensate for that, whether it was your fault or not. Then several unfortunate circumstances lined up, and now he has your tools. Unless you can physically help him complete his house and rebuild a relationship and trust with him, you have to chalk those tools up to a loss, I\u2019m afraid. I would see if there are local woodworkers in your area that are selling their tools, or a place you can go and borrow tools as you need them and slowly rebuild your collection. Asking for them back will just ruin your relationship, bc it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019ll give them back either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You couldn't help your son due to medical reasons but he was not ok with that.

He must get exactly the same, no matter the cost. Why would he be angry 3 years later and the tools are not his?", "NTA.  Just ask for them back.
