I (31F) am tired of planning vacations for my ungrateful husband (33M) and his twin", "selftext": "My husband and I have been together for seven years, and married for three months. We both work high-stress jobs, with high incomes and no children, we are frugal and spend our money on savings and trips.\n\nIn our relationship, I plan our retirement, keep track of finances, host friends/family, arrange gifts, make appointments, and plan our vacations (we travel a lot). For his part, he does laundry and cooks and does the dishes more than me. He gets along well with everyone and is the more \u201ceasygoing\u201d one.\n\nOn our trips, I\u2019ve asked my husband to help me with tasks ranging from helping me plan beforehand, to finding an Uber. Usually he ignores me until it\u2019s too late and I have to make the decision, or he makes mistakes (getting an Uber to the wrong place, or forgetting beach towels I asked him to bring). Mistakes aren\u2019t a big deal, but he places the blame for them on me.\n\nThis issue is not new to us, for our wedding I did 99% of the planning and he promised in return that he would plan a honeymoon. Right before the wedding he looked up a Costco package that was almost twice as expensive as we\u2019d agreed to spend, and that didn\u2019t have guaranteed spots. What I really wanted him to do was not to find an all-inclusive unaffordable trip (that we didn\u2019t go on) but do something that was tailored to us. \n\nMy husband also has a twin brother that often comes along with us. Like my husband, his twin doesn\u2019t help plan and he had never thanked me for planning trips for us. He behaves like coming on the trips is a gift to me. Outside of this, I\u2019ve tried to be his friend, but I feel no reciprocity. I get him gifts for his birthday and holidays, text and call him, and include him (i.e. asking him if he wants me to write his name on a Mother\u2019s Day card when he hasn\u2019t helped pick a gift). \n\nRight now, we\u2019re all on a flight back from Hawaii where I researched hotels and flights, put together schedule, booked hikes and dinners, rented a car, etc. When I brought up the fact that they complained a lot and never said thank you, my brother-in-law said that he told me the \u201csunset was nice\u201d and that is the same as a thank you. \n\nWhen I told this to my husband and explained how upset I am with both of them for not helping me (not yelling but definitely not in a calm way) he told me to f*** myself. My husband also said that if I cancel future trips that I\u2019m no longer invited to my in-laws Thanksgiving (the one thing his mom plans).\n\nI\u2019ve already planned and booked an elaborate three week Christmas trip to Italy for the three of us (they say they want to go, while doing nothing) but I just feel exhausted. At this point, I\u2019m considering canceling it entirely, canceling my own portion, or canceling one or both of their portions and going solo. Would I be the asshole if I took one of those paths?\n\nTL;DR: Burned out wife unsure about how to proceed after planning numerous unappreciated vacations for husband and brother-in-law, thinking about canceling an upcoming trip.", "created_utc": 1694137952, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cxfic/wibta_for_canceling_christmas_i_31f_am_tired_of/", "score": 8398, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is exhausting to be the one planning and coordinating a trip, and when people complain without helping at all, you just want to yell in their faces and throw things. However, neither of these things is productive. \n\nGoing forward, I gently suggest you give your husband and you a week or two to get some space and then sit down and have a calm discussion about the Christmas trip. Explain that you are not feeling the joy of traveling in a group right now and would like to take a solo trip while your husband and his brother have their own trip (or whatever other compromise/solution you've come up with). Maybe you can meet up for a week during the 3-week trip or something.  Ask him if he has another solution to you doing all the planning. Listen to what he has to say. I hope you can come up with something that works for both of you. \n\nAs an aside, I have to tell you that your husband is probably never going to be a planner. It's usually an ingrained personality trait. He may be fine forever flying by the seat of his pants and doing things last-minute. He may love a vacation where things aren't planned and coordinated, and you need to be okay with that. There is middle ground there; you just have to find it and figure out how to work together.

I felt compelled to write to you because my husband and I have a similar division of responsibilities and a similar dynamic, right down to the not-having-a-honeymoon part. My husband has really bad ADD (is it possible that this is something your husband might struggle with as well?) so planning things is definitely not his forte, and it's led to some fights for sure. \n\nFirst things first, I think you've got to stop inviting the twin brother along - it sounds like he contributes absolutely nothing and I wonder if his lack of appreciation is serving as a bad example for your husband to follow on these trips. Also I would stop arranging gifts and cards for your husband's family - I understand that there is a division of labor in any relationship, but that should for things that involve only the two of you - you shouldn't be bending over backwards for his family or his brother, it's your husband's job to coordinate those things. \n\nSecond, I wonder if you'd be ok with planning fewer vacations with your husband (and going on more solo vacations and vacations with friends instead) and then making an agreement with your husband that you will be responsible for 100% of the planning on the trips that you do go on with him, provided that he 1) agrees not to complain about any decision you make and 2) continues to do the majority of the household chores. Like some  other commentators have said, he's probably not going to change so you've got to decide what boundaries you want to set around traveling (fewer trips with him, or you go somewhere like an all-inclusive resort and just hang out, no planning involved). \n\nLast of all, the way he spoke to you when you were fighting is a major red flag - there is no excuse for cursing at your partner and disrespecting them during an argument.", "Why the heck did you marry this asshat?

We both work high-stress jobs, with high incomes and no children, we are frugal and spend our money on savings and trips.\n\nIn our relationship, I plan our retirement, keep track of finances, host friends/family, arrange gifts, make appointments, and plan our vacations (we travel a lot). For his part, he does laundry and cooks and does the dishes more than me. He gets along well with everyone and is the more \u201ceasygoing\u201d one.\n\nOn our trips, I\u2019ve asked my husband to help me with tasks ranging from helping me plan beforehand, to finding an Uber. Usually he ignores me until it\u2019s too late and I have to make the decision, or he makes mistakes (getting an Uber to the wrong place, or forgetting beach towels I asked him to bring). Mistakes aren\u2019t a big deal, but he places the blame for them on me.\n\nThis issue is not new to us, for our wedding I did 99% of the planning and he promised in return that he would plan a honeymoon. Right before the wedding he looked up a Costco package that was almost twice as expensive as we\u2019d agreed to spend, and that didn\u2019t have guaranteed spots. What I really wanted him to do was not to find an all-inclusive unaffordable trip (that we didn\u2019t go on) but do something that was tailored to us. \n\nMy husband also has a twin brother that often comes along with us. Like my husband, his twin doesn\u2019t help plan and he had never thanked me for planning trips for us. He behaves like coming on the trips is a gift to me.

Perhaps the blame is less of a \"OP bears responsibility for the mistake\" and more of a \"husband didn't want to do the thing in the first place, and feels nagged about it\".\n\nI'm curious if the current division of chores works because of natural tendencies and preferences, and whether the husband would do work he doesn't want to do, but knows is important to OP and for the sake of the relationship.", "I agree not everyone is a planner, but it sounds like they criticize her planning and don\u2019t thank her!", "This is such a nice and measured response, this is what I aspire to do/be \u2014 but I\u2019m just in such a bad headspace about this right now.

I get feeling awkward and not wanting to pick a side, but honestly \u2014 it\u2019s really shitty. Like I was sitting at a breakfast place I suggested while he brother was telling me he would have picked something better (hello, nothing was stopping him) and picking apart the trip days that already passed, when I started crying my husband didn\u2019t even say anything.\n\nThen when I got up from the table and left, my husband was really mad that I didn\u2019t give \u201canyone a chance to speak\u201d and said he was going to defend me but I \u201cdidn\u2019t give him a chance.\u201d And then he yelled at me for leaving and being, I guess, too emotional.", "We all went to grad school together, make similar amounts of money, and like to travel \u2014 we live on opposite coasts too.

He also feels like this fight is between my husband and I and he\u2019s being unfairly included, so maybe that\u2019s right.

His mom know they get upset about being left out, so she gets them the exact same gifts (think t-shirts in different colors), so she leans into it more than gets mad at them. I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s not normal, but she\u2019s pretty religious and has always taken a very mothering role with them (stay-at-home mom who is a home chef for them) so I think her advice would be more in line with how to cater to them?

I agree with others that the combination of these broken, self-indulgent people in your life can make you vulnerable to being gaslit and questioning the part of yourself that knows you deserve better. You are already, on your own, enough, and people in those trusted roles, if they are in your life at all, should enhance your life rather than detract from it. Don't be embarrassed about whatever choices you make, and in fact, REALLY, please stop worrying about what other people think or need. Give yourself the patience, love, and respect you have always deserved and tried so hard to give to others, especially those who only took from you: pour these into yourself. Either your current husband will understand he needs to treat you lovingly and supportively, or if it continues/gets worse, you can choose to live without his contemptuous treatment. That's up to you, but please don't make any decisions based upon worries of what others might think. Btw, you can click on my profile name and read the comments I have made over the years here on Reddit, and you'll see I don't usually advocate that people think more about themselves. You are the exception. You seem to be a great giver, but it's time to start giving respect, patience, support, and contentment to yourself. Most of all, it is time for you to realize you do deserve all that and so much more.", "You deserve so much better than staying in a marriage because of embarrassment or sunk cost fallacy. I hope you can find a loving partner to travel with.", "I'm really glad you could share that with me, it's clearly a lot of pressure you're putting on yourself to make it work, not to mention effort! Please don't feel embarrassed about past relationships - it is so much harder for people with CPTSD (complex PTSD/childhood traumas) because we were not modeled healthy relationships growing up. So we ignore the signs, to get fed crumbs of validation/approval.. and it hurts when that is taken away and so we try harder to make the other person happy (might ring a few bells with your mother... mine too \ud83e\udee0). \n\nIn a healthy relationship, their love is unconditional. They want to do things to make you happy. Your needs are important to them. You don't have to walk on eggshells when discussing your feelings. What you want matters to them. They will find solutions to suit you both. Future You deserves this. \n\nDivorce is just a dissolution of a partnership, except yours has been a dictatorship - and no one should be forced to endure that.

You may not get the same thing out of them that I did, to be fair, but I hope they help.\n\n1. A good therapist was/is my best tool. SImply because she helped me process my own trauma and gave me tools to cope. I also suddenly had permission and a safe space to mourn the events/situations that shouldn't have happened. \n\n2. Book: How to Talk so Kids will Listen and  Listen so Kids will Talk by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish\n\nWhy a parenting book? Because it showed me effective and healthier communication methods. This book helped me learn how to speak and listen better and more importantly, it taught me how to recognize when people weren't listening or trying to communicate with me. \n\n3. Podcast: Navigating Narcissism with Dr. Ramani (I believe she also has a YouTube page if that's a method that you're more comfortable with).\n\nWhy this podcast/YouTube? She interviews survivors of narcissistic abuse and is herself a survivor and speaks in a way that really clicks with my brain. She also talks on the behaviors in a narcissistic relationship and how and why they work. This podcast is one I can find particularly triggering because I will be listening and minding my business and suddenly, someone is talking about an event about their lives and how it effected them and OH. People aren't supposed to be treated that way? How dare you. DON'T TOUCH MY TRASH. That trauma is a gift from my father! (\ud83d\ude43)\n\nI say that in jest, but honestly, while it has been healing for me to learn about myself through other people's stories, it can also come with it's own exhaustion and grief. Again, my best tool has been my therapist and having a space where I can sit with that and learn from it. \n\nWhat isn't always spoken about in therapy or with trauma is that these events and how they effected you don't ever actually go away, but you get so, so much better at giving those events their space and learning to cope with them. You get better at learning to recognize what's happening, the role that you play in it, and where the control you have in your life actual lies (Spoiler alert: You can't make someone care about you. You can't do more to make someone care about you more. The only control you have is in your ability to communicate your hurt and to walk away, if necessary).\n\nI know this can all be overwhelming, but I do hope it's something you'll consider looking into and seeing if they jive with you. And hey, maybe these recommendations won't work for you and that's ok! Find what clicks with your brain. \n\n Time is every living creatures most valuable asset because it is so finite. You have given up so much of your most valuable asset to coordinate these events. It is perfectly reasonable to want to share the burden that comes with doing all of that work and giving up all of that time to MAKE these events work. \n\nGood luck, OP. You are so deserving of respect, kindness, and being reminded that the time and work you put in is incredibly valuable.", "OP, people will judge us by any means necessary. If it's not a \"two-time divorcee\"  it will be something else such as \"delusional wife\". If your husband does not apologize after behaving like that then I am sorry, but confident, to say you are married to a narcissist. You are very intelligent and clearly value efficiency. Narcissism is an epidemic and you are not alone in having been caught in it's path of destruction. Trying to salvage a marriage with a narcissist is a lesson in futility. I wish for you to be with those who value your loyalty and nurturing personality. I would love to tell him to go fuck himself. Jerk.", "That's manipulation to keep you in line.", "I read your comments and I sympathize so much with you. I was in a physically abusive relationship, followed by a long term relationship with a manipulative, toxic, ungrateful, verbally abusive guy. And in that relationship, my ex was also the charismatic dude that everyone liked. \n\nWe\u2019re only getting a snippet of your life here so I\u2019m going to defer to your judgment, but I will tell you that I think in my case, having the physically abusive relationship really skewed my perception of what was healthy. When I found someone who treated me better, I put him on a pedestal, when the reality is that he still wasn\u2019t treating me well, just better than physically abusive. And the manipulative, verbally abusive guy actually caused more long term trauma for me, because it took so long for me to unlearn some of the things he taught me through his behavior - like not to bring up issues with a partner because it will be an exhausting, several day long fight of me trying to justify and defend why I\u2019m upset OR I\u2019ll have to drop it to coddle his feelings. It took a lot of therapy for me to unpack all of that. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to be ready to leave him if you aren\u2019t at that point yet and if you feel like there is enough for him to be redeemed. But I would highly encourage you to see an individual therapist and read up on narcissists. In particular, I recommend people listen to the first 13 minutes or so of a podcast: Something Was Wrong, Season 3 Episode 2, titled \u201cTheir Little Counselor\u201d. The host runs through a checklist of narcissistic/gaslighting behaviors. I cried the first time I heard it because it was cathartic hearing so many boxes he checked and realizing I wasn\u2019t crazy, just really manipulated. \n\nI\u2019m rooting for you OP.
