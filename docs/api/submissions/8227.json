But lately I can't ignore those comments anymore because I've gotten tired. My SIL (35F) is the one who insists the most on this matter, she thinks that a smartphone is very necessary for a child because it connects them with their friends, I told her that it can also connect them with dangerous people and that I want to avoid that, that I wouldn't like her to end up like me, and don't get me wrong, I don't regret having children so young because I adore them but sometimes I wish my parents had been more careful and taught me more things, so i want to be better as a parent. \n\nWhen I said that my SIL said that I am being dramatic that my daughter will hate me and that she will resent us for having forbidden her something so important at this age. I told her that she is happy, and that when she wants to communicate with her friends she does it with my phone, so she is fine. But she went on and on with the same thing, and I got tired and yelled at her to tell her to shut up, that I don't want to be like her who bought her four-year-old child a phone to give it to him every time he cries, that I want to spend quality time with my children and that when they grow up they remember that and not stupid videos from internet. Of course she got mad and ended up leaving my house without even saying goodbye, but I didn't care and went on with my life. Until I started receiving messages from my in-laws saying that what I did was wrong because I made her feel bad, that she is a single mother and that is why she needs her son to be entertained with a phone, that she is waiting for an apology, and I told them that I will apologize when she apologizes to me first for having told me the things that she has been saying to me for months.

You and your husband are a team in this, which is awesome. And in my humble opinion, you\u2019re absolutely correct. The internet is a dangerous place. Much more so than when your SIL and I (38F) were young. I teach high school, and my students are *addicted* to their phones. And I\u2019m not being dramatic when I say that. Pediatric doctors and psychologists warn that phone use too young can cause learning delays, abnormal social development, memory problems, and literal addiction. Your SIL is just old enough to not remember a time before the internet, but trust me, humans have gotten along just fine without it. Your daughter doesn\u2019t need a phone. \n\nYour daughter\u2019s future educators will thank you for giving her the time to become more responsible before giving her a smart phone. And she\u2019ll not be reliant on it for constant entertainment. Being bored is good for creativity. \n\nAt the end of the day, if any argument can be made for kids having phones in these less than idyllic times, it\u2019s for a safety reason. But a flip phone works just as well to make calls as a smart phone. \n\nAnd what\u2019s more, at the end of the day, you are a great mom.\n\nNTA.\n\nYour SIL is projecting on you. And she\u2019s not the first single mom in the world. My single mother of three didn\u2019t have a phone to shove in our hands when we were bored. We played or read or cleaned. We were fine.", "NTA Your parenting should not be overshadowed by others, unless you are putting your child at risk in some fashion, which is not the case based on your description of your family's life.\n\nYour SIL sounds high maintenance based on your account.\n\nStand by your totally understandable boundaries.", "NTA. The teacher side of me will tell you phones are more drama than they are worth. A lot of social media issues we have to deal with impacting the classroom. Technology isn\u2019t bad, but I would put parental controls on and set rules for using it. Make sure you know passwords to everything. \n\nYour SIL over stepped when she told you how to parent. You kinda did as well bringing up her son. Parenting is hard enough as is. A mutual understanding that you each raise your kids as you see fit or both apologizing.", "NTA\n\nI mean personally I agree with you about not giving your daughter a phone yet, she doesn\u2019t need one imo. But regardless, you\u2019re the parent, it\u2019s your decision and your SIL needs to butt out.", "I do wonder if getting her a flip phone would be beneficial before an outright smartphone.", "NTA. Everyone is very opinionated on how children should be raised. If it wasn\u2019t this smartphone issue, they\u2019d be passing judgement on other things. You are her parent, you must do what you feel is right and ignore everyone else.", "NTA She can't comment on your parenting and badger you to do things her way, then get offended when you finally comment on her parenting as part of explaining why you won't do things her way.\n\nTell anyone calling you to poke their nose in that the easiest way for her to get you to never comment on her parenting is for her to stop back-seat-driving how you parent. If she hadn't been constantly harassing you to get your child a phone you never would have commented on the negative effects of her giving a phone to her four-year-old. She opened that door by constantly commenting on your parenting.", "NTA, my kids got phones at 16, 15, and 14", "NTA\n\nShe crossed the line with her dogged harassment over the phone issue.\n\nBut you are deluding yourself if you think your daughter is not a lot more exposed to phones and what they entail than you think. You may want to have some discussions with her about what is appropriate and what isn't etc.  Her friends have phones and will be showing her lots of things.  Phones also get upgraded... who do you think will be allowed to 'borrow' a friends old phone that you won't even know about?  Even without cellular, you can do a lot with wifi.  This is why the education side is very important.", "NAH I\u2019m an educator so i understand both sides here, \n\npersonally, i think you need to have conversations with your daughter so that the things on the internet do not influence her. you can influence her before the internet does \n\nyou can teach her about the social stigmas that come with being a girl, beauty culture, how toxic social media can be towards different things or the inappropriate things that can be found on social media. Teach her about consent, about why she should avoid sex until she\u2019s older or why she shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to do certain things.\n\nbecause I\u2019m going to be honest with you, even though your child doesn\u2019t have a phone her friends do. and If you think her friends aren\u2019t showing her things on their phones then you\u2019re very silly. friends start the influence first, especially when the child is in their early teens. \n\nIf i had children I\u2019d give them a phone by 13, but I\u2019d have restrictions on it and I\u2019d talk to them about social media and I\u2019d want to have their handles for a while. But at the end of the day it\u2019s your child and you can do as you please. No kid honestly should have a phone but since we live in time periods where school shootings are becoming a thing, it\u2019s good for the kid to have a phone.", "NTA. If you start trashing a person's parenting decisions, don't get mad when they come back at you. Moreover, your rule is perfectly reasonable and it's just her insecurity over handing her child a phone that caused her to lash out.", "NTA", "NTA. Smart phones are a headache with kids. Giving your kid smart phone means that a lot of people have access to your kid in a way that should exist. It\u2019s not good parenting. \n\nI get people come up with special reasons why it\u2019s necessary. Most of those reasons are bad. Usually the long term affects outweigh the short term benefits.", "NTA - Sometimes the yelling is what it takes to get through to people who don\u2019t listen to you when you approach disagreement calmly.\n\nEdit - If you are specifically concerned about safety while using the phone and no against them having a phone at all, you can set up parental controls to monitor their activity and restrict certain areas as needed.", "NTA. Your child, your choice. Don\u2019t start making parenting decisions you don\u2019t believe in because of outside pressures. Phones have positives, absolutely. They also have negatives. At the end of your day, it\u2019s your choice. Your SIL was out of line.", "I have two girls.  Neither got a phone before they were 13. And they are happy and healthy . One 21 and the other 25", "NTA\nAnd I'm not trying to be a SIL I don't want to tell you how to raise your child but may I suggest you get your daughter a tablet? You can put parental locks on it so she can only use it at certain times of the day and you can lock any apps like social media or any other app not suitable for a child. Again this is only a suggestion but it'll keep your daughter happy and it may get SIL off your back. (though from the sounds of it, probably not.)", "NTA. I know a lot of people say kids should have phones for emergencies and I agree, but they don\u2019t have to be smartphones. A regular phone that can\u2019t access the internet works just as well for emergency situations. There\u2019s no reason a kid needs their own phone if they\u2019re going to be supervised anyway and can use another device. I didn\u2019t get my first phone until I was 13 myself and I survived just fine.", "NTA, it's not her place to get angry with you over this.\n\nThat being said, internet/smartphone safety won't magically be a non-issue at 13, from the moment my children had an awareness of phones taking pictures I told them that no photo is ever private, that phones can be hacked. The next conversation was about people online, how you never know who someone is, that creeps can pose as kids, to never share personal info, etc. This is still an ongoing conversation.\n\nMy kids are teens now, they got phones at 10 and so far we're doing fine. Their accounts are private, they are not interested in sharing their life online, and they tell me whenever something seems off so we can talk about it. They also know I have the right to check their phones.\n\nIt's not just about the age, it is about how you educate your kids and the type of relationship you have.", "NTA. I wouldn't even apologize after hell froze over. Not only are you right in not giving your 10 year old a cell phone, but it's bullshit that she needs to guve her kid a phone because she's a single mom- single moms did *just fine* before cell phones came along! The fact she wouldn't drop it makes her a HUGE asshole. I'd have lost it on her way sooner, personally.", "NTA-Give her a quarter and tell her to call someone who cares; you'll be gray before she finds a pay phone.\n\nShe shouldn't dish it out for months if she can't take it when people snap after a barrage of harassment and unwanted comments.\n\nAlso, your daughter will be just fine without a cell phone until she's older; it just feels like forever at that age, and you could always get her an old school phone just for texting without internet access if you want.\n\nBut again, that's none of your SIL business, and she opened the door to drama by offering unsolicited parenting advice.", "NTA. IMO kids shouldn\u2019t have smart phones until around 16. Too much bullying, not to mention that it isn\u2019t even essential - the monthly fees alone make it a very expensive toy. A basic flip phone at 12-14? Maybe. Smart phones? Not until they\u2019re old enough to maybe actually need one.", "Yikes. Super toxic behavior on EVERYONE'S part. Hubby just sitting by, watching the tennis match? Or doesn't he even come home anymore? All best.", "ESH\n\nOk so your SIL was out of line but you screaming at her wasn't ok either. Both of you at AH. \n\nAs for your child and the phone, there are plenty of parental controls for phones that make them safe. If all her friends have them, and she doesn't, you're setting her up to be bullied by her peers. That's potentially worse than too much screen time. While I understand your thoughts on this, I think you're missing other aspects while making this decision that could prove to be harmful also. (I was bullied horribly as a child and have never forgotten how any \"difference\" is fuel for mean kids). I think you'd be able to meet a happy middle ground with parental controls and education, along with a cut off time for usage each day. \n\nYour SIL probably had good intentions but she boundary stomped you. But you really went off. Apologize.", "NAH I'm child free but I feel like I may raise some good points as well. \n\nI get your SIL tbh.. While yes I don't think a 10-year old should have access to unlimited internet and whatever freakshow is on here.. There's parental control and that stuff for a reason. \n\nI assume your kid goes to school and I also assume that you don't spend every waking hour with your kids, whether they are somewhere else or at home. \n\nA phone can also connect the both of you when shes out of the house, make sure she can update you if something does go wrong so you're in the loop. Sure she's 10 so she probably won't be alone too much, but you never know, especially in this world. \n\nLook, you don't have to give your kid a phone with unlimited access to the web and apps and all that. You can give her a phone with some limited space for games (if she wants) and the other normal stuff like calendar, contacting methods and SOME internet access. \n\nphones are here to stay, there's a million ways to give your kid a phone.. you could even do it only when she leaves the house as a way to contact you or her dad.\n\nETA: maybe spend time educating your kids on the dangers of phones and the internet.. That way they know about it before they may encountet it. Because trust me, keeping it a secret won't make them avoid it.. As they now don't know what to look for.", "NTA", "I wish more parents would not give their kids smartphones, but that ship has sailed, docked, and taken on its next cargo, I guess.\n\nYou are NTA and SIL should stfu.", "NTA, but I'd still apologize, albeit in a way that allows you to appropriately defend yourself. Something like \"I am sorry how I spoke made you feel bad about your parenting decisions--we all have to deal with trade-offs in parenting and I'd appreciate you keeping your opinions on my phone policies to yourself, and I can do the same, parenting is hard.\"\n\nYou sound more well-adjusted than her, making your explosion more notable, so it's probably on you to apologize if you'd like to return to some semblance of normalcy. \n\nGood luck, and I admire your smartphone policy, while encouraging the potential need to be flexible down the road.", ">because only my husband and I know what is best for our children.\n\nI'm not gonna render a judgment, but I'm just gonna say that a lot of parents say this, and it's often untrue.  It's often used as an excuse for why parents feel like they shouldn't be judged in any way.", "Esh. Your kid needs a phone if she ever needed it for an emergency she can use it. Don\u2019t be that parent who ends up on the news with a missing kid because you want to push your unnecessary stunt to prove you have \u201ccontrol\u201d. She also needs privacy. You\u2019re her parent not her owner. If you can\u2019t sit down and talk to your daughter about the dangers of online and set rules of when she can and can\u2019t use it, sounds like you need to be a better parent. Everyone in this era needs a phone. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s asking for a tattoo or a piercing.", "YTA - you yelled at her to shut up? You, an adult, couldn't find a more appropriate way to shut that conversation down? yikes", "NTA / but maybe a little E S H - your SIL pushed you and kept harping on this point and i get it, you finally snapped.
