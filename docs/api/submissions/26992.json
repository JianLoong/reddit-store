And your husband thinks it's nbd that his mother is so self-centered that now your 8 year-old daughter will be in the middle of all your pain and worry? What a family! I hope both you and your mom recover as fully as possible. And if you never speak to your MIL, no great loss imo.", "NTA. Why couldn\u2019t your husband thank her for the both of you? You were busy dealing with a life-changing surgery and stress of your husband\u2019s injury and your daughter\u2019s care. Did she want you to roll out the red carpet snd kiss her rings? It\u2019s okay if she was upset or didn\u2019t feel appreciated, but just peace-inc out like that and leaving your family stranded was out of line.", "NTA\n\n Your mother in law is going to leave you, your mom and husband in a huge bind because you forgot to say thank you before a double mastectomy??

Your cancer isn\u2019t about her. She should want to help because she loves you, her son, & her granddaughter and not for the immediate recognition and praise while you are in crisis. \n\nYour husband should be very upset & angry that his mother treated his family like this.", "Nta ffs", "NTA.

It's easy to get caught up in your feelings in the moment and forget what the situation is like for others.

That's a 12 hour drive. A simple \"hey guys, thank you for coming and thank you for bringing my mom over, but I am exhausted and have to get up early and I am really nervous about this whole situation, so please excuse me\" would have gone a very long way.

I\u2019ve been there and was an absolute wreck for about a week before my mastectomy. Ok, so the plan was for the MIL to care for the man/son and your 8 yo daughter. And for your Mom to care for you.

This isn\u2019t just a major surgery, it\u2019s so much more emotionally plus any future treatment you may need. My suggestion is to focus on your recovery and how your Mom can help you and your daughter. Your husband can take care of himself and if he has issues, he can call his Mom and ask her to come back. Then you just have to figure out how to get your Mom home once it\u2019s time for her to go, based on her needs and yours. I wouldn\u2019t address it with your husband at all until you have more time to recover. It\u2019s nothing you need to figure out or resolve right now so please don\u2019t let it add to an already stressful situation.

He did occasionally thank me but it wasn't needed. I stood by him and helped him and supported him because he mattered to me and I wanted to ease his suffering. Thats what family does for each other.
