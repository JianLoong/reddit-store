He suggested that I call my mom and ask her to come (she lives in another city, about 6 hours away). \n\nEnsue panic on my part. \n\nNormally, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue but the kicker here is that my mom was also diagnosed with breast cancer in January of this year. She is 70 years old and has completed radiation but her fatigue is strong. \n\nMy MIL lives in the same city as my mom and the original intention was (before my husband hurt his back) that she was going to meet my husband halfway between our city and her city to pick up our daughter and take to her for the week. This way my daughter wouldn\u2019t have to see me sore after surgery and so that my husband could devote his time to caring for me. \n\nNow that my husband hurt his back, I called my mom, who then called my MIL to tell her the situation. My MIL offered to drive my mom all the way here so she could care for me and then my MIL would help my husband with his back and watch our daughter (she\u2019s 8). \n\nWell, she drives here with my mom and I\u2019m finally relieved because I was really nervous that I was going to need to cancel my surgery if I couldn\u2019t get someone to come help me. Especially since my surgery was the following day. \n\nSuffice to say, that day before I was a complete wreck. I was scared for my surgery and I was also worried because my daughter was now going to be home. I just didn\u2019t want her to be scared or worried about me. My MIL and mom arrived fairly late, and I had the be at the hospital at 6am so I went to bed. \n\nI get up next day, husband drives my mom and I to the hospital and I have my surgery. It\u2019s outpatient so I went home later same day and found out my MIL had left.  Apparently she \u2018thought it was best to leave\u2019 because I had not acknowledged her nor thanked her for bringing my mom \u2014 and I made her feel like a \u2018cab driver\u2019. So this left my mom to care for me, but no one to watch daughter and help my husband. She was also my mom\u2019s ride home. \n\nI was livid at her and I feel like our relationship is irreparably broken. My husband was not too upset about any of this. \n\nAITA for not immediately thanking her or acknowledging her good deed?

Your MIL seems to lack compassion. She may have never suffered, so she doesn't know how to empathize with the suffering of others. So, driving a woman fighting breast cancer to her daughter who is starting her own journey down the same path made no impact on her about how serious the situation is? And your husband thinks it's nbd that his mother is so self-centered that now your 8 year-old daughter will be in the middle of all your pain and worry? What a family! I hope both you and your mom recover as fully as possible. And if you never speak to your MIL, no great loss imo.", "NTA. Why couldn\u2019t your husband thank her for the both of you? You were busy dealing with a life-changing surgery and stress of your husband\u2019s injury and your daughter\u2019s care. Did she want you to roll out the red carpet snd kiss her rings? It\u2019s okay if she was upset or didn\u2019t feel appreciated, but just peace-inc out like that and leaving your family stranded was out of line.", "NTA\n\n Your mother in law is going to leave you, your mom and husband in a huge bind because you forgot to say thank you before a double mastectomy?? What a petty, immature and selfish person.", " NTA your MIL is being selfish in a time where she should recognize you guys have some serious shit on your plate. None of this is about her. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have been thanked in time. It\u2019s pretty shocking she tried to make it about her, and so embarrassing.", "NTA. MIL is selfish for making you think about this right now. It doesn't sound like she has a lot of empathy for your situation.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband needs to be more upset that his mother did something so petty & vindictive less than 24 hours before his cancer stricken wife was having both her breast removed in a major surgery that may save her life. \n\nYour carefully made plan blew up last minute. Your MIL knew this. You were panicked. Your MIL knew this. You have a young daughter you want to protect from being exposed to what some adults cannot handle. Your MIL knew this. Your mother who is living with cancer was coming as part of the team to help you, your husband, & your daughter. Your MIL knew this. You almost had to reschedule your surgery. Your MIL knew this. You had to be up very early for life altering surgery. Your MIL knew this. \n\nFor your MIL to abandon you, her son, and her granddaughter who very clearly needed her because only YOU didn\u2019t show her what she deemed enough gratefulness and appreciation with less than 12 hours before your surgery while you plan went awry for you cancer surgery & aftercare is cruel & vindictive. Your cancer isn\u2019t about her. She should want to help because she loves you, her son, & her granddaughter and not for the immediate recognition and praise while you are in crisis. \n\nYour husband should be very upset & angry that his mother treated his family like this.", "Nta ffs", "NTA. She sounds horribly selfish.", "NTA. It sounds like she was looking for a reason to leave.", "This sounds like a horrible stressful situation for everyone involved. It's easy to get caught up in your feelings in the moment and forget what the situation is like for others. Imho it's too bad when everyone feels this way at the same time and end up clashing, but it's not irreparable. I'd say you and your MIL can talk this through later when things are calmer. NAH.", "INFO: what do you mean when you say you didn\u2019t acknowledge her, as distinct from not thanking her?  You at least said hello and exchange some manner of pleasantries, right?", "ESH. I have a lot of experience with death and many genetic diseases in my family all ranging from different kinds of cancers, several autoimmune diseases and heart problems, all of which have cost our family a lot of loss of people dear to us. These people always were nice and forth coming, in my family it's normal to say 'thank you, please, you're welcome' in every situation, if someone just stands in the way and moves aside, if someone reaches you something from the kitchen, let alone if someone drives someone to you, that lives 6 hours away. That's a 12 hour drive. A simple \"hey guys, thank you for coming and thank you for bringing my mom over, but I am exhausted and have to get up early and I am really nervous about this whole situation, so please excuse me\" would have gone a very long way. Your MIL isn't much better though, just leaving in times of need instead of putting her being offended aside, is a childish and selfish move!", "Info:  So when mom and MIL got there did you not acknowledge them? Or how did that play out, did you just see them and go to bed. Or did you say \u201cok you\u2019re here good night.\u201d Or was it more of a \u201cfinally it\u2019s about time you got here. Good night\u201d it\u2019s really hard to say with such limited info. Not to mention if hubby was getting them settled for the night. What did he say to them. And was there places for them to sleep or did they have to sort all that out themselves?  Because to me, she should have been thanked when she offered and arranged to drive all the way in with your mom.  And a \u201cthanks again for driving this whole way\u201d. \n\nBut when our brains are scrambling to organize everything it\u2019s hard to remember some basic things.  Or did hubby not thank her either.  It\u2019s hard to know what was said. \n\nNever the less reaching out and saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt disrespected and that I was ungrateful for your help. I really did appreciate the effort you were putting in. I may not have expressed it in the moment. My brain was jumbled and I wasn\u2019t really thinking clearly.\u201d \n\nAll depends on what you did say or do when they got there that makes a difference. However you would be if you don\u2019t do something to fix it now.", "NTA, only because your MIL seems to me to have overreacted by a mile. \n\n--->If you turn the situation into estrangement you're an asshole too though.\n\nBut you seriously didn't even acknowledge/thank her when she arrived with your mother? A simple comment on arrival like \"Thanks for driving my Mom here on short notice\" or even \"Thanks for doing this, now I won't worry about husband/kid while I'm recovering\" or anything else really.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You probably dodged a bullet by her leaving.", "Wow, what an over-reaction from her, way to make it all about you, MiL...  \n\nIf she felt ignored, unappreciated, etc, she could have expressed this using words like an adult.

It\u2019s not weakness and doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t fighting. It\u2019s a real life experience. It means she has a broader understanding about life when she becomes an adult.

He not in the middle, he putting himself there, he should be stood next to you on this. \n\nShe LEFT his kid to witness trauma, she left him when he was injured, for what exactly.

She took something that was happening to you and made it about her.", "He needs to pick a side. He needs to pick the side of protecting his wife & child. His mother is not on that side. She actually purposely set it up for yours & his daughter to be directly exposed to things you both felt would scare & traumatize her. She knew that. She is ok with hurting her own granddaughter because you did t kiss her ass enough. \n\nThere are sides & he needs to be clear what side he is on.", "You\u2019re right - that\u2019s a great way to look at it. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nWe hadn\u2019t fully disclosed to her that I had cancer \u2014 only that I had something bad in my body that needed to come out. Luckily, many of my appointments were during the day and she was in school. So she never noticed.

And more resilient than I am giving her credit for!", "Thank you so much for saying that \u263a\ufe0f  \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that at such a young age.
