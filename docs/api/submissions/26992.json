And your husband thinks it's nbd that his mother is so self-centered that now your 8 year-old daughter will be in the middle of all your pain and worry? What a family! I hope both you and your mom recover as fully as possible. And if you never speak to your MIL, no great loss imo.", "NTA. Why couldn\u2019t your husband thank her for the both of you? You were busy dealing with a life-changing surgery and stress of your husband\u2019s injury and your daughter\u2019s care. Did she want you to roll out the red carpet snd kiss her rings? It\u2019s okay if she was upset or didn\u2019t feel appreciated, but just peace-inc out like that and leaving your family stranded was out of line.", "NTA\n\n Your mother in law is going to leave you, your mom and husband in a huge bind because you forgot to say thank you before a double mastectomy??

Your cancer isn\u2019t about her. She should want to help because she loves you, her son, & her granddaughter and not for the immediate recognition and praise while you are in crisis. \n\nYour husband should be very upset & angry that his mother treated his family like this.", "Nta ffs", "NTA.

That's a 12 hour drive. A simple \"hey guys, thank you for coming and thank you for bringing my mom over, but I am exhausted and have to get up early and I am really nervous about this whole situation, so please excuse me\" would have gone a very long way.

This isn\u2019t just a major surgery, it\u2019s so much more emotionally plus any future treatment you may need. My suggestion is to focus on your recovery and how your Mom can help you and your daughter. Your husband can take care of himself and if he has issues, he can call his Mom and ask her to come back. Then you just have to figure out how to get your Mom home once it\u2019s time for her to go, based on her needs and yours. I wouldn\u2019t address it with your husband at all until you have more time to recover. It\u2019s nothing you need to figure out or resolve right now so please don\u2019t let it add to an already stressful situation.

He did occasionally thank me but it wasn't needed. I stood by him and helped him and supported him because he mattered to me and I wanted to ease his suffering. Thats what family does for each other.

Thank you for stranding my mom, also dealing with cancer, 5 hours from her home. Im just saying all this because it\u2019s apparently so important to you to get those thank yous out immediately and your behavior shows us exactly who you are. \n\nNTA op and I hope you continue to heal and recover. Your daughter will be okay, she\u2019ll get to see her mom overcome and get stronger.", "NTA don\u2019t speak to that woman. She plays games when you\u2019re down and low", "NTA.  \n\nSend her a text - it will be cathartic to you.   \n\nHello MIL.  Thank you for picking up my mom.  With all my anxiety and worry about my surgery I missed thanking you at that time.  But then you abandoned my husband and daughter, and ultimately me, when you decided to have a tantrum.  Just know that I will never forget this.\n\nIt really doesn\u2019t gain anything tangible except you may feel a little bit better.", "MIL should have taken the kid back with her as promised and then came back to drop her off and puck up your mom. \n\nThis is a 'I love you and will help' situation not a 'scratch my back and ill scratch yours' kinds of situation. The complete narcissism of making you stress about this while going through cancer is appalling and toxic. You shouldn't rely on her for any other favours unless it is your last resort. \n\nCall her and innocently pretend it was all normal and just wondering when she's coming to bring your mom back?", "NTA\n\nYou have a lot going on.  MIL has to back off a bit.", "NTA\n\nI'm in the hospital right now after getting my colon removed. I had to have my best friend fly in from another state and I forgot to tell her thank you until I was in recovery and she didn't care. She knew my head wasn't in the right place and didn't take it personal. \n\nI'm sure MIL'S feelings were a little hurt, but that's the kind of shit you get over when loved ones are dealing with so much at once. I'm sure you would have remembered once you got home and settled. And it's just rude as hell to leave with no warning when you promised to help, I mean her son is out of commission and needs help, even if she was upset why not at least stay for him?", "NTA.\n\n1. They arrived late. 2. You had to get some rest because you needed to leave super early the next morning. 3. You were understandably stressed about your diagnosis AND the fact you were going in for major surgery. \n\nAnd after all of this, MIL didn't feel appreciated? She was acting like more of a child than your 8 year old. \n\nI think you need DH to see your post or for you to explain all of this to him, as he clearly doesn't see how his mother was out of line for her response, and her impatience to be appreciated in the moment.", "I bet your mother thanked your MIL for the ride profusely , and that should have been enough for then. You could then told your MIL later how grateful you were for all her help. \n\nYour MIL is self centered and not very compassionate at all. She was terrible to leave you in the lurch when she promised her help but did not deliver.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe someone can be so selfish doing something that should have been out of love. Wow. I would never speak to her again. And your husband should be WAY more upset about it.", "NTA \n\nEver\n\nAt all!\n\nI'm a 2x breast cancer survivor and was a complete wreck before my surgeries, but particularly before my mastectomies for the 2nd breast cancer. My kids were 2 and 5 at the time and I was out of my mind with stress. Amputating parts of my body because they kept trying to kill me. Stressed over the risky nature of surgery. Stressed over stressing my happy bright kiddos.\n\nYour MIL has absolutely NO CLUE the stress you're under. Standard operating procedure is pour love and support in towards the cancer patient and dump all the crappy stress and BS away from the cancer patient.\n\nYour MIL is a selfish ghoul.", "Just because you did not fall all over yourself kissing her feet immediately doesn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t grateful or wouldn\u2019t have expressed your gratitude as soon as the highest stress part was past. Geez, she could\u2019ve given you a moment!\n\nI don\u2019t know if YOU should ever forgive HER for making your emergency all about her. \n\nNTA, and no great loss there. Sheesh!", "NTA- \nWay to make this situation all about her! Holy shit. The only fully \u201chealthy\u201d one of the bunch!", "NTA. But I think you should let your daughter in a little more to what is going on. My parents were really protective about us not knowing when someone I our family was sick or dying, and I didn't go to my first funeral until I was 19. It really messed me up for a long time, and I still don't really process serious illnesses and death in a healthy way because of it. I understand wanting to shelter your daughter from all the suffering and pain while she is young, but you have to remember she will be an adult some day and she needs to be prepared to know how to process when things like illness, cancer, and death happen to her loved ones. So take advantage of these moments where you can teach her how to work through these emotions and feelings with your guidance and support, instead of her having to go through it all alone as an adult.", "Oh, did the attention stray from her? You monsters. \n\nThis is who she is. Believe her. NTA.", "NTA your MIL is being entitled.", "NTA. MIL needs to be pulled aside and reminded that she\u2019s not the main character here and perhaps she needs her empathy adjusted.", "Nta. Sorry you are going through this. You mil kicked you while not just you were down but the entire family. Over something petty. She was filling in for your husband so tech the ty should have came from him. I would make him pick up the slack since he thinks its no big deal. To me, thats the biggest spit in the face ive heard about in a LONG TIME. AND BY HIS MOTHER?!? He is probably too embarrassed to admit he is bothered but this would be my hill to die on. Leaving me there to try to hide my physical & mental pain from my child so she doesnt get scared. To leave my mom who just went through radiation & is beyond exhausted & to leave my husband who is injured to pick up the pieces. All because you have a lot on your mind?? Ppl like that aren't welcome in my circle or my circus.", "How did your MIL make this all about her", "Omg", "NTA. Your MIL is an asshole.", "NTA.\nWhat an absolute cow, urgh, I hate her, so bloody selfish, imagine having your loved one about to have life changing surgery and you make it all about you getting told \"thank you\".\n\nShe's an absolute wombat, I hope your husband wakes up to himself and realises what a dick his mum is.", "NTA your mil is wildly childish of course, but I'm concerned that your husband is not only 'not wanting to get in the middle' (when one person is clearly the wronged party, YOU didn't do anything wrong), but after he hurt his back HE didn't find a replacement for your care. Your husband left you to scramble to find someone to look after you post surgery, right before you were about to go *through* this huge surgery. He's not bothered by his mother's reaction, and he didn't seem too interested in helping you find post-surgery care.", "ESH. Your MIL for being a shitty mother and even shittier grandmother. Your mother and your husband for not thanking her - she did change all her plans at the last minute and was your mothers taxi. And you? After everyone changing their plans for you, you couldn't stay up & greet them when they got there because you needed beauty sleep before a surgery the next day? Pathetic excuse.", "MIL has main character syndrome and had to make your cancer surgery all about her. She needs to get over herself. NTA.", "Shady Pines Ma. Shady Pines.", "It makes me feel like she has no idea what unconditional love is.", "This.  When my sister\u2019s husband died I was the cab driver, cook, cleaner & babysitter. And I certainly didn\u2019t expect any thanks for it.  We were in survival mode and that\u2019s just what you do in family emergencies.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f", "I don't think you're aware of how intense a double mastectomy is. Patients have limited range of motion, drains, and the pain is serious.", "The only time I think of when she was like this with me was when our daughter was born. I was allowed to have only two people in the delivery room \u2014 that was my mom and husband. MIL was disappointed and I could understand that, but I didn\u2019t make the rules. And of course I\u2019d choose my own mom to be there! Again, it wasn\u2019t to intentionally hurt her feelings.", "Send her some flowers with a card that says \"thank you for making my cancer surgery all about you\"\n\nAnd go NC\n\nNTA", "You are so wrong. This is not on you. Your MIL is so far up her own ass she couldn\u2019t be kind to HER grandchild for one day so that she wasn\u2019t traumatised. Even if she was THAT butt hurt she could have waited an extra 12hours to leave. She has shown you she hasn\u2019t regard for anyone other than herself.", "If it\u2019s any consolation, I grew up with my mom having constant emergency surgeries starting when I was 5 or 6, and generally speaking, was never really too scared or worried. Kids normally tend to have the \u201cmom/dad\u2019s got this! They\u2019re strong, so they\u2019ll make it through\u201d mentality more than anything else. They\u2019ll understand they have to be super gentle with hugs and everything and that life will have to take a brief pause for a bit. but as far as myself and other people I know who have had similar situations as children go, I\u2019ve never met someone who was too scared or worried to have that be the right term. Obviously they\u2019re worried, but not in the way of an adult. Kids are smart, don\u2019t get me wrong. But you guys got this, I promise!!! I know 8 is a little different than 5/6 for these things, but I\u2019m sure you guys will make it through just fine in the end \ud83d\udc95", "Oh OP. This didn't fail because you didn't say thank you, it failed because your MIL is incredibly self-centred and couldn't summon up the most basic human empathy for your situation. The current circumstances are a result of her choices, not yours. Your MIL wasn't able to be kind to you, but you can be kind to yourself and let these feelings of guilt go so that you can focus your energy on healing. I wish you all the very best for your recovery.", "She did something huge for you. Why didn't you thank her and why haven't you apologized?", "No, it all failed because your MIL is an AH.\n\nGet well soon!\n\nNTA.", "You were in a very vulnerable place pre -surgery. MIL is completely ridiculous.", "I want to know how badly his back was injured that he couldn't care for his wife at all but was still able to drive. Maybe I just don't know much about the recovery process from a double mastectomy, but I do know that serious back injuries often keep people from being able to drive.", "This forum is odd, it is asking if YOU are the AH not if your MIL is the AH. I said YOU are NTA on the limited issue of overlooking a tired thank you and getting some sleep but apparently because the fanboys in the cheap seats think your MIL is the AH I committed some sort of sacrilege. Your MIL is an AH but a mild one as she drove 6 hours with your mom and with your husband laid up she wasn't getting much help as a 60-year-old herself. Asking her to take care of you, your husband, and the 8-year-old while staying in the guest room is a big ask of any in-law.", "I don't think you realize that the forum is AITA, not, is the person you're having a beef with the AH. I said on the limited issue of whether she was an AH for not thanking her MIL, that she was NTA. The MIL though, who drove 6 hours as a 60-year-old is only a mild AH, she was expected to care for her son, daughter-in-law, and the 8-year-old apparently if the husband and wife having the surgery were both laid up and convalescing. She had buyer's remorse as a 60-year-old with limited energy and lacking a bit of patience. She could have communicated better too.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f", "I have multiple chronic incurable degenerative diseases, and I will eventually die from them, in great pain. I am in pain at all times, and have severe chronic fatigue, and sometimes cannot get out of bed.\n\n\n\nMy 11 year old daughter has had to wait an extra day for her Easter basket, because I couldn't stand up without passing out from exhaustion. She's had to accept that we are reschedule a shopping trip because I am in too much pain and won't be able to walk without crying. I've had to break the disappointing news to her that we need to do something a different day over and over again, and it breaks my heart for her every time.\n\n\n\nBut she never blames *me.* She tells me \"it's ok,\" when I tell her I'm sorry, I just can't do it today. She's never questioned the severity, or if it's real like other people have. She sees the sores, and the limping, and every wince of pain I try to hide, and she pats me on the arm, with comfort.\n\n\n\n\nShe's a good girl. She has learned compassion from my situation. She has learned to be gracious, and selfless, and how to put needs of others before wants of your own. And I thank her for that, because I appreciate it, and she's 11, and it's something she taught herself, and I am very proud of her for it.", "I recommend looking into the show. Bluey.\n\nThere is an episode called the show where the kids are setting up a play for their parents to watch.\n\nIt triggers chili the mom for an event that she'd experienced.\n\nDuring it she comforts her child and her child learns from how she comforted herself.\n\nAnd later her daughter comforts herself the way she learned from her mother.\n\nWhich honestly boils down to having a good cry picking yourself up. Dusting yourself up and trying again.", "Please tell your daughter the truth. Lying to her hurts her more in the long run. Being young doesn\u2019t mean kids are stupid."]}
