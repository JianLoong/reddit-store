And yes this is a serious post. \n\nI (27F) am seeking judgment on a recent incident that occurred in my relationship. After enduring my boyfriend's habit of making sad puppy noises during arguments for a continuous period of 8 years. We dont argue a lot, but he does this every argument. \n\nTo provide some context, my boyfriend (28M) is generally caring and affectionate, but he has a tendency to respond to discussions or expressions of my feelings by making legit sad puppy sounds, sighing, and pretending to be in distress. This behavior feels like he's attempting to guilt trip me or deflect from the issue at hand. I have told him to stop after we both calm down from arguments. However, despite my confrontation, he continued to make those sad puppy noises.\n\nLast friday, we were arguing about him asking a waitress for her number because she was wearing his favorite band Merch. He started doing the whimpering again. In the heat of the moment, feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, I lost my temper and raised my voice, exclaiming, \"this again?! please stop!\" Surprisingly, his whimpering instantly ceased. I was so tired that I simply shutdown and started rethinking my relationship. \n\nNow, I am questioning whether I am the asshole for blowing up on my boyfriend after he continued making those noises despite my confrontation. I understand that raising my voice might not have been the most effective way to handle the situation, but I had reached a breaking point.\n\nUpdate: we are meeting up tomorrow and talking about this, but I\u2019m probably gonna have to end this relationship because I cant see him changing. Thanks for opening my eyes. This sucks but I can\u2019t imagine continuing like this for the rest of my life.\n\nFINALE UPDATE: we broke up, i meet with him at starbucks and tried talking to him (I wanted closure) and he started whimpering again. I told him I cant do this anymore and wished him the best. He started hyperventilating and getting louder so I rushed out", "created_utc": 1687905994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ks4ad/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my27f_boyfriend_after_he/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe let that sink in a bit so you can wise up and date an actual, well adjusted adult next time.", "To sum up: your long-term, adult human boyfriend asked another girl for her number in front of you. When you then asked him why, he started making puppy-like whimpering noises to dodge the question.\n\nNTA unless you continue to put up with this. (And Y T A for having put up with it for eight years so far.)", "INFO He needed someone's number for favorite band merch? Does he not use google?\n\nNTA Take \"Old Yeller\" out back and...you know.", "NTA- I can\u2019t say with certainty based off of this post alone, but it sounds almost emotionally abusive like he\u2019s trying to downplay what you\u2019re upset about whenever you\u2019re upset, or like he\u2019s making fun of you in a way.", "NTA to OP, but this gave me a case of the icks so hard.", "NTA and your bf gives me the ick", "NTA but if you continue putting yourself through this torture of a grown adult whining and whimpering than YTA to yourself", "YTA to yourself. Eight fucking years? I'd be done on the third argument", "NTA - he sounds like a lil b", "NTA.\n\n100% you don\u2019t ask a waitress for their number to \u201cbe friends\u201d because they like the same music that\u2019s such a bs line.\n\nYou need to rethink this situation, sorry OP", "NTA.\n\nThat response to your serious concerns is also incredibly condescending. Essentially he's making fun of your concern and belittling it.", "NTA. \n\nA 28yo man with a longstanding habit of whimpering like a kicked puppy. You sexy timed with that? \n\nThrow him a bone (literally) and rehome him.", "NTA he\u2019s belittling your feelings. It\u2019s extremely immature.", "Geez that whimpering is behavior I would except from a child, much less a full grown man. Did his parents spoil him so hard he acts like a actual baby?", "\\*sad puppy noises\\*\n\nJK, NTA, it sounds like it might be a habit/mechanism your boyfriend might've formed when he was younger but never grew out of. He needs help & you have pretty good patience for having put up with it for 8 years.", "Nta- put a muzzle on him", "When I asked him why he would ask her for her number, he said between whimpers that he wanted a friend who liked the same music as him (he already has some, but they dont live in the same city).", "Eight. Years. I can't.", "I get all the icks from reading your post and this reply. How does he not creep you TF out? You let this man touch you even though he whines like a puppy when he\u2019s in distress? Ughhhhhhhh", "Yeah it sounds like he\u2019s using these noises to guilt and manipulate you. It\u2019s not fair to a partner and it\u2019s also really immature. \n\nI would tell him whenever he does this that you are walking away, and you two can continue the discussion/argument topic when he is willing to do so like an adult.", "It sounds suspicious to me, i get he might want a friend to go to gigs with. Im pretty sure there are better ways to find them than asking random girls for their number though. The whimpers just make him seem immature and like he is just trying to make you ignore what he has done wrong in the first place", "I mean, if his music tastes are kinda niche I get that. I get like a dog seeing another dog across the street when I encounter someone irl who's into the same music I am, so that in and of itself isn't a red flag to me.\n\nBut the whining and whimpering? Holy hell you're a better person than I not to have yelled about it until now. That's pretty close up there with \"kissing you to shut you up when you're arguing\" as far as gross and unacceptable methods of avoiding taking responsibility for manging conflicts. This is not someone who's ready to be involved in a relationship if he thinks this is okay.", "You are completeny right, I think I needed someone else to say it for me to realize how bad the situation is. Thank you.", "Right? It\u2019s so strange and off-putting!", "No worries. We\u2019ve all been w/ a creepy guy at some point, you\u2019ve got this :)", "He probably thought it was cute\u2026 when he was fourteen", "Oof, you didn't have to call us all out like that \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude01", "Fourteen?

In front or not in front of you.", "I have a 13 y/o son , it would be obnoxious and embarrassing if my son did this. I wouldn't even find this cute with a toddler.", "Does he hold his hands up to his head to make doggy ears? \n\nDoes he wag his butt when he is happy and excited? \n\nI also can\u2019t believe he made the noise in a public restaurant where other people can see and hear him. \n\nNTA.", "Oh my god that sounds so uncomfortable. I wouldn't even allow my dog to do that. \n\nIt sounds gross, and tbh unhealthy. When I have something to say to my partner i expect him to look me in the eye and listen, so we can talk about it as adults, now him whimpering and cowering while looking away.", "NTA\n\n\n\nIf I ever had a boyfriend that whimpered and made \"sad puppy noises\" during a discussion/argument, my first question would have been \"What in the actual fuck is wrong with you?\" I can't believe you tolerated that for 8 years. Glad you're moving on!", "Definitely NTA. Maybe the waitress will find the noises cute.", "I'm sorry, is he a living breathing 4chan post?? What the actual fuck. SO glad you updated to say you dumped him, it would be massively embarassing to bring that man anywhere in life. Imagine taking him to a work dinner not knowing if he'd start whining like a dog at the table...."]}
