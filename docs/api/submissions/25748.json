They will not be contributing to rent or utilities, and I'm guessing they won't be contributing to the food bills either. This will be a considerable financial hit for you.\n* You are being asked to bear the costs of a commercial storage facility. You don't need one. You **have** a storage facility. A free one. It's called the spare room.\n* You are being asked to do this massive favor not because the couple is under financial strain or in a desperate situation from which they have to escape, but basically because they want a 6-month free vacation in the UK.\n* You don't say whether you are friends with the couple who want to take the spare room, but I'm guessing you're not close, and possibly have never even met them. So you're being asked to share living space for six months with people you haven't lived with before and you don't know whether you can live with them harmoniously. (Even friends often discover the dynamic changes when they're forced to share living space. Habits that you never minded before during the occasional dinner become major irritants when you're confronted with them daily.)\n* If your landlord discovers that you are subletting the spare room, the lease could be terminated and all of you could be kicked out.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't even do this for one month, and frankly, given your housemates' obnoxious behavior (sending you Y-T-A messages, cold-shouldering you), I'd be disinclined to even give them a week. I think the request is outrageous.\n\nIf the couple are not short of money, they can do what normal people do when they want to \"experience the UK\". They can pay for their own place to stay.\n\nUPDATE: Some commenters are saying E-S-H based on OP's remark that he thinks they're doing this **just** to irritate him. I suspect that's a rhetorical flourish, like the line about the kitchen trembling in fear. I seriously doubt that OP is so conceited that he genuinely believes they cooked up this scheme just to irritate him.", "NTA.  Do not agree to even a weekend. The entitlement of your housemates, and more so their guests, is staggering.  If they stay for a month, they may have tennants rights.  Even without tennants' rights trying to evict them while the housemates want them there.  There is no scenario where allowing them to move in won't be a miserable experience.\n\nI would also set up cameras in your common areas.  They may just move in while you're working.", "NTA ...so it is considered OK to ask someone to pay the bills for six months, while you shower, cook, wash your clothes, spend the electricity and contribute nothing to the rent? Good to know. WTF", "NTA. \n\n6 months is not a reasonable ask to give up space in your home for. \n\nEspecially if you are paying their house expenses for 6 months, and losing the free use of your bathroom AND having to pay storage for your things while sacrificing room in your house. This arrangement costs you money and free use of your home. \n\nYou should demand the upstairs bedroom permanently if you\u2019re willing to compromise with this ridiculous request.\n\nEdit: Punctuation.", "NTA. it's illegal for them to move in there. You're being gracious by saying they can stay for a month. They don't need 6 months to experience the uk, and if they do they can pay for somewhere else to stay. If they can't afford that then they don't need to be experiencing the UK for 6 months. Your roommate is being a huge A H. how does your partner and the other partner feel about this situation?", "NTA.  Your only mistake was suggesting one month instead of six.  Don't give an inch or you might never get your space back.", "Demand the upstairs bedroom, they can share a bathroom with THEIR friends", "NTA and I'd have a counter offer for them:\n\n-The guest space stays a guest space, they can move in with your roommates into the massively large private floor bedroom upstairs.  \n\n-They can use your roommates bathroom. \n\n-They will pay x amount for the priviledge. \n\n-Maximum stay will be just under what qualifies them as residents/tenants.", "NTA. Having someone stay for a significant amount of time is one of those things that everyone needs to be on board with because this is not a small impact on your lives. And, honestly, if they are staying there for 6 months, they should be paying rent and utilities. This is not a visit for a couple days, or even a week or two. This is taking on a full-time roommate for half a year. And the rent he pays should also include the storage you need for the stuff you have to move away. \n\nThe \u201cguest\u201d is making a lot of demands for someone who is staying there for free. It is incumbent on the guest to adapt to their hosts, not to make the hosts bend to their every whim. If he wants demands to be met, pay rent.", "Absolutely NTA and at this point, any 'compromise' should be off the table, due to their harassment. The initial request was absolutely ridiculous and entitled. You should not have to share your PAID space with invaders for HALF A YEAR. Uh that's a hard no. \n\nMaybe it's time to bring in a string of short-term guests to occupy that space up, making it look a little less empty to these AHs.", "NTA for so many reasons. \n\nI suggest you change bedroom with the other couple and let them share a bathroom for the month.", "A clear NTA.", "NTA.  Tell them you want the upstairs bedroom with the ensuite and you'll consider it.", "Tell them you will get the bigger bedroom forever and they pay for your storage and 1/3 of utilities, then it's a deal.\n\nNTA", "Hahaha! He's funny! Six months! No way! \n\nNTA", "NTA - do NOT let them come - aside from it all being completely unreasonable,   in the UK that would be creating a house of multiple occupancy (if you haven\u2019t already depends on your locality)  - which   requires a special landlords licence and extra lists of expensive things from the landlord -who would also potentially get fined if found to breach it - so IMMEDIATELY you are found to have done this and allowed six unrelated people in a normal occupancy dwelling the landlord will basically have no choice but to evict you. That\u2019s it. If you do cause them to be fined by deliberately breaking your tenancy agreement in this way then a professional landlord will then issue a claim against you to recover their costs and get a CCJ to ensure it is paid - which will ruin your credit for 6 years and red flag you for any other property. And don\u2019t think the landlord or the council simply won\u2019t find out - they almost always do.", "NTA\n\nDo not compromise, once they are in it will be a pain in the ass to get them to leave. \n\nI know you said this is just to irritate you sort of tongue in cheek, but you could be right. Are they trying to irritate you enough so you move out and the other friends become permanent roommates?", "NTA. Brass balls on that one.", "Nta take the one month off the table. That\u2019s too much. \n\nTell the other people your willing to let their friend stay for 6 months once you switch rooms permanently so you get the bigger room.", "NTA. If it's in the lease then they can't force the issue. Tell the next one who calls you the asshole that he's the asshole for expecting you to do that. Tell them that your terms are 6 months rent paid upfront plus extra for the bills. Your roommate pays all storage fees and every day for that six months he must tell you how wonderful you are for allowing that.", "NTA, don't let them come even for a month. Give someone an inch...", "So 6 months of them living rent free, contributing nothing to the living situation AND you will also be out more money because you will have to store your belongings elsewhere. NTA. a few days is one thing, but 6 months is a HUGE difference. If they can not afford to actually live in the UK for 6 months, not sure if they can afford to and just do not want to or not but it is not sounding like it like can afford it, then they need to save for awhile and try again another time. This is beyond ridiculous to even ask and I would be embarrassed to ask for myself let alone for someone else!", "I would even go one higher than just saying HELL NO, I would contact the person you rent from and see how they feel about it. if they live close to your flat, maybe they will keep a close eye on things while you and your partner are at work. I am sure they will not be happy about the arraignment if they knew about it. see what your lease says about subletting or having more than just you all on the lease in the house for extended periods of time, that way if your flatmates continue to pester you about it, you can refer back to the lease and tell them that it say \"XYZ\" and you would hate to get evicted due to some people you do not know nor are you comfortable with, coming and staying for a 6 month long vacation. If your landlord is a hard ass like the people i have had to deal with in the past, they will gladly keep an eye on things and make sure everything is kosher and no one extra is moving in.", "Nta", "NTA... but offer to exchange rooms and take the upstairs with ensuite.  \nMight be worth the 6 months.\nA Rent was a reasonable option, especially when there is storage costs and additional utilities and less personal space", "They ain't gonna stop till you give in.      \nGood luck finding a new place/roommates.      \nNTA", "Oh my.  NTA.  And you may need to consider a new living situation if the other couple will not respect your \u201cno.\u201d", "You can of course say no to this as you live there.
