I (F23) and my husband (m23) recently got married a few months ago and got a house. His family lives overseas but are planning to move here. One brother came before we got married and I knew he was going to live with us (m18) and it was fine, I agreed. However, 6 weeks ago I found out his older brother had booked a ticket to come live with us for *what I thought* was a month a half. It turns out it\u2019s for 6 months. My husband said he wasn\u2019t aware at first but seemed shifty, and later acknowledged he was aware he\u2019d probably be around longer than a month and a half. I can\u2019t tell if he downplayed it or I misunderstood. I have been upset and wanted for us all to talk like adults about cars and bills and schedules, plus about not being spoken too before the ticket was booked. I spoke to them the other morning, only for the older brother to just stand up and leave after I spoke after ignoring me and staying on his phone. I said his name so he knew I was speaking to him. He walked out and eventually then asked us for the ride to work! I kept it light, spoke to him along side my husband so he didn\u2019t feel singled out and he flat out ignored me. My husband has done nothing to solve this in six weeks and I\u2019m questioning this mess. Am I wrong to be upset? His family says hospitality is important and more family is more blessings, and I agree but I just wish they\u2019d respected me enough as the new bride to ask how I felt living with a third male.

I may be reading too much into this, but it sounds like there may be cultural or religious issues that I\u2019m not familiar with that might be limiting you from actually setting clear boundaries about the situation. You married into a family that is used to this sort of arrangement and thinks nothing of the inconvenience it places on you.

Hopefully this isn't a pattern, because I know I couldn't stay with a partner who disrespected me by allowing people to live with us without first running it by and lying about the length of their stay.

That needed to be a conversation.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, he chose to marry you and your culture, just as you did him. Adjustments don't go only one way.\n\nAnd if his answer is that isn't okay with him, you have a simple answer. And if he agrees you are right- there needs to be an immediate agreement that he will speak with older brother about him being out of the house in a week and will take the blame with his family.

And you will get a new view of your married life.", "The BIL ignoring her reads they comes from a very patriarchal family/culture. If that is the case, he will NEVER listen to her unless or until her husband puts his foot down.  And if he was raised the same way, he'll likely just  placate her until she gives up.", "Yep sure does. Sounds like you described literally and exactly and only one thing that is a dispute. It's a big dispute and one they need to work out. It hardly sounds so impossible to me that I would say they absolutely must divorce immediately because their entire relationship is now proven unsalvageable. You don't even know these people.", "The brother straight up ignored her, husband lied to and ignored her, other brother ignored her, ILs ignored her. Where is the line if not a mile passed?", "It's a recognition of a certain pattern in behaviour, and I don't know about you but if I had a young daughter who'd recently been we'd, I wouldn't be comfortable in the slightest if I found out she was in this situation.
