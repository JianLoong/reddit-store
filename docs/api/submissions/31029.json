I (F23) and my husband (m23) recently got married a few months ago and got a house. His family lives overseas but are planning to move here.

I can\u2019t tell if he downplayed it or I misunderstood. I have been upset and wanted for us all to talk like adults about cars and bills and schedules, plus about not being spoken too before the ticket was booked. I spoke to them the other morning, only for the older brother to just stand up and leave after I spoke after ignoring me and staying on his phone. I said his name so he knew I was speaking to him. He walked out and eventually then asked us for the ride to work! I kept it light, spoke to him along side my husband so he didn\u2019t feel singled out and he flat out ignored me.

His family says hospitality is important and more family is more blessings, and I agree but I just wish they\u2019d respected me enough as the new bride to ask how I felt living with a third male.

A lot of this behavior is alarming and unsettling. I'll start on the smaller stuff. One of his brothers just pretended that you didn't exist, your husband saw that and allowed it to continue to happen. He lied to your face about his brother staying and the amount of time BIL will be there. This isn't a little white lie, it's a huge lie that affects you a lot. I was going to propose that he went with ask for forgiveness not permission, but he's not sorry at all about this. He expects you to just hit the ground running and be an amazing host while one of your guests won't even talk to you. No one in that house respects you unfortunately. I'd recommend therapy if your husband would be willing. If not, you have a few options. You could try to kick the brothers out, tell your husband they have only a month and a half to get out of your house.  Try setting a boundary there. Is the house under both of your names or just one of you? That does effect the situation. You could kick them out or leave depending on the house. You could try to make peace and accept that this is your life now, that you'll be treated like this by him and his family for the rest of your life.  Or you can just leave now. Do whatever is best for you, don't worry about your husband or his family. They don't care about what is best, good, or even okay for you. Don't give them the respect they don't return. You deserve  better.", "NTA \n\nYour husband should have been open with you about plans that impact your household. And it should have been a discussion and agreement. Definitely not a surprise. You should be partners. He also should have stood up for you and addressed the blatant disrespect towards you. \n\nI would be upset too if it\u2019s been six weeks and he hasn\u2019t stepped up to resolve the issues. It\u2019s his responsibility because it\u2019s his family. He needs to communicate boundaries and expectations to them. Ignoring it and not saying anything isn\u2019t going to fix it, if anything it tells his family that it\u2019s fine to treat you that way. And it honestly is concerning that he hasn\u2019t viewed that as a problem or understood your perspective on this. You need a clear conversation with your husband. \n\nAlso, even if you could go back in time, agree to them staying with you, be prepared, etc\u2026.he should have been proactive and set boundaries and expectations before they even arrived. Adjusting to sharing space and new people even when everyone is great can cause disagreements or resentments. \n\nAnd you deserve to feel at home, comfortable and respected in your own home.", "Your husband is TA. \n\nI would not stand for this. No way. \n\nI would demand a formal lease agreement because otherwise, there is no telling how long they will stay.", "Nta.  Don't tell husband you are planning to leave because I don't want you to end up in a hostile situation with your husband and brothers until you can leave. Get your arrangements taken care of including getting your important papers together then leave.

The fact that he has lied to you and his family  that is there chooses to be disrespectful, and he does nothing  but leaves you looking like a controlled idiot. Your feelings  don't  matter, and this sounds like he married you so that he can get his family  citizenship. Cut your losses before  you have kids and are stuck with  these people.", "NTA.. but what nationality is his family? It sounds like a male dominating culture and in their eyes, you are nothing and have no say or allowed feelings. \nYou may have a huge problem here and will need to make sure you have a safe place to vacate to in an extreme moment. \nPlease becareful \ud83e\udec2", "NTA If I were you, I would be secretly consulting with an immigration attorney.

I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you.", "YTA. Stop trying to control other people. Your \u201cfeeling\u201d of being dismissed doesn\u2019t mean much to me.

I said his name so he knew I was speaking to him.\n\nYou are young so maybe you didn't know but that was your cue to blow up and kick him out on the spot.\n\nNow he knows.

Do not \u2014DO NOT\u2014 have any children with this man thinking \u201coh when we have our own family, he will establish boundaries and stick up for me\u201d. It won\u2019t happen. Editing to add: this is why I dislike when Reddit glamorizes multigenerational living, living with extended family, etc. It\u2019s one thing when in dire need, but there is a reason women from cultures where this is actually practiced (and not just a romanticized answer to challenging economic times) tend to HATE the reality of it.", "You need to talk to your husband because this is s husband problem.\n\nYou just got married and ate entitled to know what his family's plans are and decide if you'll agree to hosting them.\n\nIs he signing immigration papers to sponsor them?", "NTA.

Your husband will always put his family before you. Your feelings are simply not important. Sorry - but knowing sooner is better than later.", "NTA\n\nYour husband flat out lied, and 6 months will extend indefinitely. He's probably NEVER going to leave. People never stick to those dates..they just use them to get a foot in the door so they can mooch off someone else as long as they can. \n\nI suggest that YOU leave. The house, the marriage and the mess of a family that your husband has. \n\nDivorce this asshole.", "NTA, and you and your husband need to speak about this privately and come to an agreement.  It sounds super awkward, having relatives there for an extended period of time.  I'm thinking the two brothers can rent their own place.", "NTA - damn did you get a bait and switch. On top of that it's not going to end. I suspect you will be hosting family members from overseas the rest of your life if you can't get ahead of it. The problem is your husband doesn't have your back and is totally fine inviting his family to come and stay as long as they want. He's not listening to you, he doesn't respect you, and neither does his family.  To me this would be a huge red flag and I'd seriously be considering divorce. The honeymoon is barely over and he's already treating you like a non-entity in your own home.  Not saying that you should divorce over this but for me it would be a deal breaker. He's putting his family before you and I suspect that he always will.", "This will keep happening if you stay married to your husband.  Counseling might help, but I'm doubtful.  \n\nYou are NTA.

Ugh.", "> *are they from a culture that doesn\u2019t respect women*?\n\nIf there is any possibility at all that this is the case, then you need to be very, very careful leaving, OP.  You might want to get advice from a women's shelter, even though he hasn't hurt you physically.  \n\nMy personal advice is to take the money that you have, get the paperwork and your important possessions, and leave.  Go back to your parents home and find a job there in person.  Don't tell him your plans or he may try to stop you in some unexpected way.  Call him when you get there.\n\nIs your husband and his family from a culture that expects women to dress in an extremely modest way?  If so, the brother might be contemptuous of a SIL wearing what we consider normal clothing.  He might have very volatile emotions, OP.
