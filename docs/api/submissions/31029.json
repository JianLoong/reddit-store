I (F23) and my husband (m23) recently got married a few months ago and got a house. His family lives overseas but are planning to move here.

I can\u2019t tell if he downplayed it or I misunderstood. I have been upset and wanted for us all to talk like adults about cars and bills and schedules, plus about not being spoken too before the ticket was booked. I spoke to them the other morning, only for the older brother to just stand up and leave after I spoke after ignoring me and staying on his phone. I said his name so he knew I was speaking to him. He walked out and eventually then asked us for the ride to work! I kept it light, spoke to him along side my husband so he didn\u2019t feel singled out and he flat out ignored me. My husband has done nothing to solve this in six weeks and I\u2019m questioning this mess. Am I wrong to be upset? His family says hospitality is important and more family is more blessings, and I agree but I just wish they\u2019d respected me enough as the new bride to ask how I felt living with a third male.

As they make money they should contribute to the household as they are not an honored guest to be wait on hand and foot if they're going to be living you as a roommate for the next 6 months.\n\nBut this early in a marriage to do something like this feels like a big red flag to me.

He expects you to just hit the ground running and be an amazing host while one of your guests won't even talk to you. No one in that house respects you unfortunately. I'd recommend therapy if your husband would be willing. If not, you have a few options. You could try to kick the brothers out, tell your husband they have only a month and a half to get out of your house.  Try setting a boundary there. Is the house under both of your names or just one of you? That does effect the situation. You could kick them out or leave depending on the house. You could try to make peace and accept that this is your life now, that you'll be treated like this by him and his family for the rest of your life.  Or you can just leave now.
