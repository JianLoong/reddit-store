If you don't book a specific seat, you sit wherever until someone kicks you out because they have a ticket for that seat. Tough luck.  The fact that they were elderly is irrelevant.

Just because they are old doesn't mean they are entitled to them.", "As a French person, YTA but probably not a conscious one.\nYou just said your flight was deleted because of the protests but didn\u2019t it come to your mind that trains were deleted too ? \nEspecially high speed trains, which is probably what you take according to your ticket price. \nIn average, their number is divided by 3. \nYou probably saw that when you reserved your seat but a specificity of high speed train is that you must have a seat. You can\u2019t be standing all travel long. \nTherefore, on your train, there were 3 people per seat. \nAnd here comes the problem, how do you seat 3 people on the same seat ? \nAnswer : You don\u2019t ! \nThat\u2019s why the SNCF ( the French train public company) has a simple solution : reserved seats no longer exist. \nFirst come, first served ! Even if it was not your attributed number before, if the seat is empty, you can take it. \nAnd now is the moment where you might be/ not be the asshole. \nThe solution is announced before you take the train but knowing the SNCF, it was probably just said in French and/or only to the first passengers.\nWhich means that if French is not your first language or if you came just before departure, it\u2019s kinda normal you didn\u2019t have the information. \nNonetheless, just for you to know, many French people in this train probably assume you were an asshole.  \nBut in any other situation than this one, if you have reserved the seat, you are NTA to demand them back.", "NAH.

Ever tried just a little bit of kindness?", "NTA since you reserved the seats, but I\u2019m curious are there no priority seats for the elderly that can\u2019t be reserved? In Ireland there\u2019s always a number of seats that cannot be reserved when booking that are for elderly/pregnant/injured/etc people to avoid situations like this\u2026 unless it was so busy the reserved seats were also taken. Either way, the overcrowding was not your fault and you paid for the seats so fair is fair!", "NTA you paid for the seats", "NTA. This is why you get a seat reservation: You want to sit down. This elderly couple was chancing it, and they lost.", "NAH\n\nThere's nothing wrong with them sitting there until someone showed up with a reservation.  But you paid extra for the seats.", "Alot of places the seat just comes with booking online the price is the same. Last minute is always expensive. And old people have free travel in alot of europe or cheap like 50% off.", "I realize this is a moral dilemma, not a legal one & that OP is in Europe\u2014so I don\u2019t know the laws in regards to accommodating the elderly & those with disabilities\u2014but in the US, the ADA requires *reasonable accommodations* on transportation. Better seats other people paid more money for does not fall under *reasonable accommodations*. \n\nI only say this because I am a flight attendant & am frequently berated by elderly people who are irate that we cannot move them 30 rows up on a full flight & they subsequently have to sit in the cheap seat they purchased. Most who pitch a fit claim they are *legally* entitled to a better seat, which they are not. They are entitled to assistance to & from said cheap seat. \n\nAll that being said, this couple doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of people I\u2019m describing.

One time I had a financial meeting with an investor for a portfolio under my name only. The entire time, the investor only looked at my bf and asked him questions even though I'm the one answering and when I'd redirect him back to me, he would eventually start gravitating back to my bf.", "Because, shockingly, old people don't like listening to women at all.  They go out of their way to ignore them in some situations and will only address the man if they present as a couple.  She was right to assert herself and demand his assistance.\n\nEdit: Try observing an elderly person receiving care in a hospital, and the doctor that shows up to help is a woman.  They will frequently request a male doctor.", "Fair, but the gentlemenly thing to do would be to ask the older man to stand for his gf so both women could sit, but hey they paid they can do what they want", "Yeah. Last time I went to the symphony, the people next to me were discussing how long to wait before moving to other, unoccupied seats. That\u2019s just how some people roll.

There are many scenarios but that doesn\u2019t change the moral aspect.", "> in a lot of places you get up for elderly people out of respect...\n\nYes, that's normally true on public transport when someone hasn't reserved a seat.  When someone *has* paid extra for a reserved seat, it is not disrespectful for them to use it.", "You\u2019re been a dick. Starfire is not OP and has nothing to do with not giving up a seat for the elderly couple. They merely stated that people don\u2019t tend to listen to women as much as men. Besides, everyone is entitled to the seats they paid for. I\u2019m a boomer and I don\u2019t feel entitled to anything someone else has paid for.

Also why should a total stranger respect me more than the 30 something person sitting next to me, they don\u2019t", "Uh your point makes zero sense lol. You are saying people rightfully don't listen to me because of what? I was not on a bus, and I haven't been in a situation to deny elderly people anything. What am I doing to be a selfish bag? \ud83d\ude02 Like you're taking a hypothetical situation I hypothetically put myself in and you're like \"no wonder people don't listen to you, bc you were a dick to old people in a situation that never happened to you\"\n\nSo presumptive and so much flawed logic it hurts my head\n\nEdit: meant to say train not bus lol", "Shut up Janet.\n\nRead it again.", "Yeah, no harm no foul. I wonder if these people were even trying to guilt OP or if they were just disappointed that the seats were paid for.", "There is no moral aspect to people literally stealing the seats you paid for."]}
