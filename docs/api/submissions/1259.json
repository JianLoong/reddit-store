It all started pretty much 1 year ago. We got to know each other through discord. For info (I'm m/21, she's f/18, we're living in Germany). We met each other in real life at new year for the first time at her mums place. Its a 3 hours ride away from my place. I'm also still living with my parents.We then started dating until around april. From then on we decided to move on as just friends. We both have our own problems with mental health. Which can be super difficult at times.At the time she also had struggles finding a job or anything else she could move on with.So she came up with the idea to attend a school I graduated in, before I was going to university.I then offered her to move in for the time she would be attending the school and my parents also agreed on it. Even though they've never seen her before, because we would always meet at her place.My parents took all the costs, but giving that her mum is living alone with her 2 daughters we didn't want to ask for it. Nor was it ever really offered though.So she moved in in August. Giving me confidence that she's so motivated and won't have any problems at school.It quickly became clear though, that she cant push through it. She wouldn't go to school anymore after just a couple of weeks. Lock herself into her room. Play video games all day or be spending time on discord. She always argued, it's because of her mental issues and she couldn't do anything about it and I couldn't really argue against that.We tried to find therapy help, but she argued it wasn't suited for her.So she was quickly arriving a dead end. Yesterday she eventually texted me.Saying she wants to try school next year. She want's to focus on her mental health first. But my parents would still pay a full year on top of that to someone they barely see or talk to cause shes always locked up in her room. Also we previously failed to find help for her. And we can't be sure it would work out next year. So this wasn't really an option for us.\n\nIt took me a day to answer on that. I feel bad about taking my time to come up with a response. I was trying to find work arounds, but I came to the conclusion that this simply doesn't work anymore and told her.\n\nWell now she's saying I gave her a false sense of safety and I communicated terribly because I took a day for my answer and leaving her on read. I also wouldn't have been supportive enough.\n\nI know leaving her on read wasn't a fair decision. But I was just totally overwhelmed. I honestly don't know how I could've done more for her without getting dragged into depressions as well though..\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667587466, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym6va6/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my_families/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't sound like this is a healthy relationship anymore and you have to lookout for yourself too. It sounds like you should pare back the relationship and direct her toward orgs that could help her instead of you all.", "NTA.\n\nThe purpose of her living with your family was so that she could attend school.  She stopped attending school so she has no need to live with you--she can go back to live with her mother.  She says she wants to try school again next year, but I think that is just an excuse to be able to living without responsibilities until then.\n\nIt is not unusual for an 18yo to have trouble with school when they first have freedom from their parents.  You gave her a chance and she wasted it.  You have no obligation to continue.", "NTA. She is an adult that wants to be coddled like a child. If she's not contributing anything, nor holding up her end of the \"deal\", then there's no reason for her to continue living with your family and anything more is just her taking advantage of your generosity.", "NTA. Taking time to process something and really decide what you want to say before responding *is* the healthy way to communicate.\n\nYou can be empathetic that she has mental health issues that are currently not being adequately managed, but that doesn\u2019t mean managing them becomes your responsibility"]}
