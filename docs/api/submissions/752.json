{"id": 752, "submission_id": "yjm9ag", "title": "AITA for wanting to call CPS on my friend?", "selftext": "So I (17f) have a friend (18f) (let\u2019s call her Lea) who has a six month old son. He is taken care of, i.e. is fed, clothed, bathed, etc and loved very much by his family, but Lea isn\u2019t the one taking care of him, her mother is. Lea is always either at her friends house or has her friends over and rarely is with her son, let alone takes care of him. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m considering calling cps.. The house her family and baby is living in is completely infested with cockroaches. Like at least thousands of them, I\u2019ve seen them everywhere in the house, including on the baby\u2019s clothes (not while he\u2019s wearing them) and on the little play things he sits in. I\u2019ve never seen one touch him but I\u2019ve seen them on things he touches (like the floor), and I know it can\u2019t be sanitary. When he was first born, cps was called and they gave them 30 days to find a new place to live or they\u2019d take him away, so Leas parents bought her and her husband a shed to live in on their property. It has a toilet and a tub with running water so I believe it\u2019s acceptable. The problem with that is once they brought all their things over, the roaches started infesting their new place too. They also never keep it clean, there\u2019s always trash and dirty dishes and dirty laundry everywhere. Every time I see them the baby is at the house with his grandma though, so he\u2019s still around the major infestation. I know the right thing to do would be to call but I know he\u2019s loved and taken care of, so would I be the asshole if I called?", "created_utc": 1667338889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjm9ag/aita_for_wanting_to_call_cps_on_my_friend/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
