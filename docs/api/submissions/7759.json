Her poor planning is not your fault. If he cared that much, he should have given up his seat. NTA. He is an ah.", "I'd say NTA on the example you gave. It is unfortunate for the woman, but asking you to spend hours standing was cruel. \n\nYou said your opinion about it, and as long as you said it in a normal tone, nothing wrong with that. It is imo an unhealthy dynamic that you can't disagree with your parents without being called names and so on.", "NTA.\n\nAt the point that you were asked to give up your seat, the woman had paid for a ticket, so she deserved to be on the train.  What she did to try to save money before is not important.  She did not ask for the seat, so she is not AH.\n\nYour father was trying to teach you that it is polite for a man to give up his seat for a woman, especially if they are elderly or with small children.  But if your father was concerned about this woman's comfort, **he should have given up his own seat**.  \n\nOr possibly you could all have taken turns standing, each for 90 minutes total if you had 5 seats for 6 people for 9 hours.\n\nYou were not an AH at age 12 for not being more gracious than your father.  And you're not an AH now for bringing it up.", "NTA Funny how your father doesn't feel the need to be nice to others, but demands you are.", "NTA. You shouldn't reward people who try to freeload, even if they get caught. The woman knew she was supposed to buy a ticket and she deliberately didn't. She should not be rewarded with a seat for the journey she tried to get for free. The number of children she had with her was irrelevant. Perhaps if she'd had one fewer then she would have more easily been able to afford a ticket.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you didn't tell the people who stared at you that your father forced you to give up your seat to an attempted fare evader.", "NTA. And that woman is an AH too. She happily sat there for hours watching you standing there, miserable.", "Sounds like your parents like to seem like charitable people, but don't like to be the ones actually doing the sacrifice. They let you stand while they sit. \n\nThis is a pretty normal thing for asshole parents.\n\nYou'll have to decide for yourself as you get older what you will let them do, and what you won't.\n\nAll i can say is, you wont get anywhere talking to them. They are assholes. They like being assholes. You will never, ever, ever, get THEM to understand  that THEY are assholes. That time happens when people are younger. Your parents are too old. \n\nMy mother would buy food for homeless people. She did a lot for people in need. But she never asked me to give my food or my seat or anything. She took responsibility for her own charity.", "Are you eastern european by any chance? That\u2019s so similar to what we were told as kids - we have to be polite and always give up our seats because that\u2019s what well behaved kids do. And anything else is shameful. I never got that. It\u2019s like your comfort doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re young. \n\nNTA for sure. But I reckon it\u2019s a generation clash at play here.", "NTA, but if this is really one of the worst things that's ever happened to you, then you've had a pretty nice life!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I feel this example is part of a larger picture of mistreatment. I\u2019m so sorry, OP.", "NTA at all. Making you get out of your chair instead of your dad getting up is ridiculous. You even mentioned how people began staring at you  making you very uncomfortable. I also think it's concerning that he doesn't acknowledge the fact it's not specifically safe on a train when you're that young. You had a right to feel the way you do, your parents just don't want to own up to being selfish and basically neglectful on a 12 hour train ride.", "NTA- but I think your father\u2019s intentions aren\u2019t to directly harm you when trying to look out for others. He\u2019s being courteous in his misguided efforts, which is probably just cultural. I\u2019d say forgive your Papa, and know we\u2019re all completely clueless when it comes to parenting in a society.", "YTA. Sorry, but kids give their seats to adults sometimes. It's manners.", "Thanks. I didn't expect replies that quick, yeah when I remember it now I ask myself why he didn't do it instead?", "They always make sure to make people comfortable which nice I admit it but it goes way too much. When I said it was the worst thing I said in a normal tone but after they replied tbh I was kinda loud and yes we can't disagree with my parents and discussion with them is really hard as they believe it makes parents and their kids in the same level which isn't true parents are bigger.", "Thanks but FYI I'm female", "Also the father couldn't have given HIS seat huh?", "Tbh my parents are really charitable they give a lot of money and food but it's way too much of how they control us to keep people comfortable even when no one complains", "North African \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah I don't think I had HARD life but I'm still young and I didn't face much really", "Because that would be an inconvenience.  He's not _that_ kind.", "They are not. They are just people who happened to put more people in this world. It doesn't make their opinions on anything more valid than their child's in any way, shape or form.  Parents do not own the concept of being right only because they're parents, it doesn't matter how much they want this to be true. Your parents sound weirdly altruist, to the point of inconveniencing themselves and their children for the sake of strangers to an unusual amount, that's for sure. Don't let them fool you, this isn't normal behavior at all. Next time don't let them treat you like a pushover.", "Fair enough. Your parent's first reply was to brush it off with a \"that's rude\" so not very engaging!\n\nImo, parents and kids are on the same level when it comes to respect, and many other levels. I can't understand parents according more comfort/respect/credits/rights to other people than their own kids. It doesn't change the fact your are entitled to your opinion about what happened to you, and the fact your parents are a one-way street when it comes to discussion is not on you, but on them. It is their pov, and you're NTA for having a different one.", "I don't know how long ago this was, but I was giving your father the benefit of the doubt and trying to be sensitive to cultural differences. The only cultural difference I see here, is that your father does not value his daughters.\n\nI can't imagine why he singled you out, except that maybe you were the oldest?  I don't see how letting your 12yo daughter wander around a train looking for a seat is being a responsible father.  At all.\n\nIf he was trying to be nice, again I'd say having everyone take a turn at standing might be fair, but forcing you to stand for 8-9 hours for this woman was just an AH thing to do.", "That is a very specific form of abuse, very very subtle.\n\nMy advice would be to let them do what they do, but slowly leave without them noticing.\n\nI know it sucks, I do. But if you can, leave slowly and don't be angry.\n\nPeople like this can be very destructive. So just be nice to them.", "Heh we are very similar then, who knew\u2026. Did you also get the whole \u2018don\u2019t interrupt the adults when they\u2019re speaking\u2019 at the same time as \u2018stop being so quiet and shy you\u2019re embarrassing me\u2019? One of my friends had that constantly", "Hey, good for you! It's okay to still be annoyed over things that aren't catastrophic.", "I'm the second child and I think because I was sitting near him that's why I was the one giving it up. I really don't mind being nice to others but I can't forget how time was passing soooo slowly, my legs and back hurt so bad", "I want to leave but kinda hard here\nEdit: one word", "Yeah exactly I've heard that my entire childhood no wonder I rarely sit with them", "I recently flew overnight  9 hours from the US to Europe, then had to take a train in the morning.  I was with 2 co-workers and I purchased reserved seats in 2nd class.  When we boarded the train it was over-full, and there were people sitting in our reserved seats.  I made them move, including the woman in my seat.\n\nShe had purchased a \"non-reserved\" ticket, so when the open seats were gone, she would be expected to stand.  She took the risk to save money.\n\nIt was only a 1.5 hour train trip, but I had not slept on the plane. If I was not so tired, and if I was travelling alone, I probably would have let the woman keep my seat.", "Yes. Be as strong as you can, and bend when you can. Like the willow that bends in the wind but doesn't break.\n\nOnly you can decide what is right for you. Different cultures have different values.\n\nI want you to be happy and healthy. I'm my culture, your parents would be tossed to the side. But maybe that's not right for you.\n\nAll I can say is, you are right to feel what you feel", "Thanks"]}
