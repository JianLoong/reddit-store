You need to do what's best for you, and no one else gets a say.

I was referred to mental health and they basically said it was clearly my ASD but they couldn\u2019t do anything to help because I didn\u2019t have an official diagnosis, they put me on the waiting list for assessment and basically told me to twiddle my fingers for the next 2 years with just sedatives to alleviate symptoms, I can\u2019t afford private. You may not need the diagnosis now, I never thought I would, but it\u2019s a bloody long wait with no help god forbid anything changes, it might be worth putting yourself on the NHS list, it is minimum of a 2 year wait, in some areas up to 4 years I\u2019ve heard so if you want to back out closer to the time it won\u2019t wake a difference to anyone else waiting.", "NTA most autistic adults don't get a diagnosis because there are zero reasons to, it's expensive, time consuming and honestly hinders you more than helps you, just tell her that discussing your mental health it is none of her business", "NTA.

I\u2019m in the US, not the UK, but the local hospital who does adult testing has a waitlist of over 2 years \n2) While there are benefits to diagnosis, there are a lot of bad parts to it as well. Some countries won\u2019t allow autistic people to immigrate there, and some doctors still act poorly to autistic people or treat them like infants who cannot make their own medical decisions (this in particular is crazily worrying to me as I\u2019m trans and the increase lately in \u2018autistic people who \u201cclaim\u201d they\u2019re trans are just confused\u2019 rhetoric could very well prevent me from receiving HRT if I had a diagnosis.)\n\nOverall though?

It can limit what visas you can get and outright prevent you from living certain places. It\u2019s subject to a lot of ableism.

And in our case, we have lived so much life without knowing that any benefit of knowing in our formative years is gone.\n\nI think your friend needs to calm tf down and realize that at the end of the day, a diagnosis is really just a label and although it holds meaning for some such as myself, to others it doesn't have any significance. Why should she get to choose how you handle it? And why is it your responsibility to student become an advocate for people with autism now when you went most of your life not knowing?

Autism is a development disability which requires supports. The fact that you \"need no supports\" indicates that you're not autistic. It's fine to use whatever strategies you need to feel better, however folks self dxing or claiming autism makes it harder for autistic folks to get resources and confuses the general public about autism. They'll see your claim and say \"x doesn't need supports/doesn't act the way you do. You have no excuse for struggling/not taking responsibility and don't say it's autism causing this.\" This phenomenon of folks labeling themselves is already spreading misinformation and shifting public view of a serious condition.

I tried to get screened as an adult recently and even though I went to the only clinic in my area that does adult testing they warned me that the screening they use isn't always accurate for adults. They used mostly the same screening as for children, and playing with toys to describe your feelings as a grown adult who functions independently in society isn't going to tell anyone anything useful. The diagnostic tests also use numerical scores so you have to give concrete answers, which doesn't allow for the nuance of cases like \"I technically can do this because I've had to fake it for years but it doesn't come naturally and stresses me out\" or other complicated feelings and behaviors that adults who have learned their own ways to manage their symptoms might have. I found it to be a total waste of time as someone who doesn't need formal accommodations or treatment. If you manage your life well without those resources that could only be accessed with a diagnosis, then you'd do just as well the way you operate now and trying to seek a formal diagnosis would be a complete waste of time if it doesn't interest you.

There are pros and cons", "In addition to things that improve your social life, consider things that might improve your sensory experiences! \n\nFor example-- noise-cancelling headphones, lamps with adjustable brightness/dimness, fidget/stemming toys, and a weighted blanket. \n\nYou might like some them, you might not. But there's a chance that if you research & experiment with \"things Autistic people use,\" you might find something that'll make you go \"Oh, that is MUCH better! SO NICE!\"\n\nSo it's worth looking into (speaking as an Autistic person)", "These are not symptoms of autism. The real issue is that you're not getting support for whatever condition you have. The fact that you need no supports means that you don't have autism.", "The autism spectrum doesn't go from no supports up it goes from LOW supports up. If you cam get along fine and are successful in every aspect of life what's going on isn't autism. Spreading misinformation also includes self dx as it impacts public perception.", "I don't believe you're a therapist and you're for sure not a autism/developmental specialist or you'd not be spouting nonsense talking points. Autism acceptance is great! But autism is a developmental disability which requires support. Obviously you don't get support with no diagnosis. If OP need no support but finds some strategies helpful that's great but self diagnosed folks muddy the waters about thr seriousness of the disorder and harm the community. Particularly those with high needs by saying \"it's just wiring\" rather than a disorder and serious medical condition.", "Then NTA. You're not required to be an advocate for other people.", "It's a common trait for people with autism to be physically aggressive.", "I guess it depends on the country. \n\nMy daughter emigrated to a different European country  (coming from Germany) where she also got her diagnosis - and she has made only positive experiences, e.g. a long-term contract of employment and accommodations at work (plus she became one of the \"faces\" for the diversity program of the company\\^\\^). Knowing her diagnosis people are also more ready to accept her \"quirks\" .\n\nCompared to what I had to go through (I was only diagnosed very late in life) it made her life a lot easier, even though she doesn't need any support in the strict sense of the word).", "These absolutely are symptoms of autism, especially for autistic women, who are frequently misdiagnosed with things like social anxiety and OCD precisely because autism often presents differently in girls and women, who are more effective at masking their communication and social deficits.", "Who made you an expert in autism?\n\n>The fact that you need no supports means that you don't have autism.\n\nThis is utter nonsense. I was only diagnosed when I was 50 (yes, at an official autism centre at a real university) and obviously I had survived until than without any support whatsoever - even though my autism is very obvious to real experts.\n\nIt did come at the cost of several autistic burnouts but that can't be helped - there is no support for autistic adults anyway.", "I\u2019m not gonna argue about the self dx stuff cause I feel like neither of us will convince each other and it\u2019ll be a waste of energy for both of us. But I do want to note that OP specifically said they don\u2019t go around telling most people and they don\u2019t do any sort of advocacy or what have you. Even if you believe self dx is inherently harmful, what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t exactly causing any harm to \u201c\u201d\u201dpublic perception\u201d\u201d\u201d (or whatever you mean by that. Autistic people have always been looked down upon or misunderstood lol) It\u2019s just them using the label in their private life as a means of understanding themself better, and if that helps them and isn\u2019t hurting anyone, then who are we to debate about it? \n\nAlso, getting a diagnosis is not all receiving support and positive things. There are many negatives to receiving an autism diagnosis unfortunately. I lack a \u201cformal, on-paper\u201d diagnosis myself (I say formal and on-paper as I\u2019ve had several mental health professionals agree I\u2019m autistic, they just haven\u2019t put my diagnosis on record) and haven\u2019t sought one out after finding out it could impact my ability to receive gender affirming healthcare (I\u2019m trans) or migrating to different countries.", "You don\u2019t have to believe me. But not all autistic people need support from doctors. And believe it or not, you can go to a regular therapist for support. I also have no idea where you are getting this idea that OP needs no support from as she has said it no where. In fact she comments that she experiences meltdowns. You have absolutely nothing to base your argument on and are making things up to fit your narrative. You are additionally not answering my question about WHAT resources self diagnosed people are taking away from others. The only one brining up the harmful narrative that it\u2019s \u201cjust wiring\u201d is you. You obviously have something going on in your personal life that prohibits you from engaging in a critical discussion as you are repeating the same non examples and refusing to answer questions, I hope you are getting support with whatever is effecting you.", "Really? What do you base this statement on?", "Oh yes, 100% depends on the country. It is definitely a case by case basis and either path is valid!", "The symptoms of autism don't change with gender. If your symptomis anxiety, treating anxiety will help.", "There are many supports for autistic adults including living supports, workplace accommodations, therapies, and more. If you were diagnosed you're a minority to have not been detected for such a long time. A majority of autistic folks have significant support needs, sometimes including being unable to live independently.", "I never claimed they were taking away resources. I said it skews the narritive and presents an unrealistic picture of what autism is. And yes, Autism requires support from doctors (developmental specialists and others from comorbidities like gastro issues) AND therapists (speech, occupational, sometimes physical, often mental health). OP stated \" I don\u2019t need any assistance nor meds, I\u2019m doing great with my career, etc.\" Sp likely if they have traits (as most people do) they are subclinical and wouldn't result in a diagnosis. It's as absurd to claim you have autism with no diagnosis as it is to say you have downs with no diagnosis. The lack of critical discussion is to be had with people who claim that autism isn't a disability, having a diagnosis is a disability and is somehow simultaneously a privilege...", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7803482/\n\nhttps://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/understanding-aggressive-behavior-in-autism/#:~:text=One%20study%20found%20that%2015,and%20intellectual%20disability%20showed%20aggression.&text=Another%20study%20of%20autistic%20adults,had%20aggressive%20behavior%20over%20time.\n\nAnd it's much more common when you look at children.", "The symptoms of autism absolutely present differently based on gender. It\u2019s one of the reasons that for years it was a common belief that women couldn\u2019t get autism, and caused many autistic women to be misdiagnosed with ADHD", "I didn't say the symptoms change. I said they present differently in girls and women. Which means boys/men and girls/women have many of the same root traits, deficits, and concerns, but due to biology, socialization, or both, the specific ways those traits, deficits, and concerns manifest may be different. There has been a significant amount of research on this topic. Rather than arguing with me about it, you should look into it. It's fascinating.\n\nRegardless, treating an autistic person with anxiety like a neurotypical person with anxiety is unlikely to treat the autistic person's anxiety effectively, as anxiety is often a secondary concern that results from the primary concern of autism. It's like seeing 2 people who are wet and saying the solution for both is to turn off the water hose, when 1 is wet because they're being sprayed with a water hose, but the other is wet because they fell in a lake. How does turning off the hose help the person who keeps falling in the lake?", "Again: Who made you an expert on autism? \n\nAutism is a spectrum, and many, many autistic people only now get diagnosed  because they do not have obvious behavioral problems and support needs and have been flying under the radar. This is especially true for autistic women who are - on average - much better at masking than autistic men.\n\nAnd no, for autistic people who are able to live independently (which is the vast majority) there is no support -a t least not here in Germany. There are no therapies to \"cure\" autism anyway, and the therapies that are offered a) focus on communication (something adults with a late diagnosis usually already have mastered by themselves) and b) mostly only accept young adults. Last year I took part in a multi-university research study cum therapy, and while it was nice to meet other autistic people and to have regular meetings once a week this therapy did not actually help me or the others with the problems we do have in life - I am quite good at communicating but I'd need, for instance, someone to help me keep the house clean.\n\nAnd work accommodations are just that - accommodations, not support. Accommodation means things like being allowed to work from home or not having to share an office, i.e. not making work unnecessarily hard. Not making work unnecessarily hard is not the same as actively helping someone.\n\nAnd yes, compared to the support autistic children can get autistic adults get no or almost no support.\n\nAll I got was a certificate of disability that gives me a discount when I go to a museum.", "You obviously do not understand the concept of a spectrum. Not every single autistic person has to seek out doctors. Some people may just struggle socially and do not need to seek out extra support, you are wrapping autistic people into one big bag. And you quite literally did say they were taking resources: \u201chowever folks self dxing or claiming autism makes it harder for autistic folks to get resources\u201d. And again, WHAT RESOURCES. You are answering nothing and repeating the same things over and over. Just because YOU believe autistic people have to seek out support in certain ways does not mean that it applies to every autistic person.", "So you base it on articles you have read. No first hand experience?", "More common in children, where you get that from?", "Or with depression as was the case with me.", "But they aren't totally different from the diagnostic criteria of autism. Theres never been a belief that women don't have autism, but there have been higher rates of male diagnoses. Women may be lower support needs but have been socialized not to address their needs and misdiagnosed. But the symptoms are the same between genders, and severity levels vary by individual.", "If there are an abundance of people claiming autism and needing 0 support, that affects the support market and the public perception of the condition. If anyone can claim a disability, then the folks who need help but are lower support needs get taken less seriously.  YOU obviously don't understand that the spectrum doesn't go from 0 support needs up, but that to even be classified as autistic you need to have some level of support needs. If you don't need supports you're subclinical and affecting a disadvantaged community by saying you have Autism Spectrum DISORDER.", "Personal experience is probably about the worst place to take data from because it's entirely anecdotal. Those are empirical studies or articles discussing empirical studies.\n\nDo you disagree with those studies?", "Anecdotal evidence is inferior to medical studies. Some autistic folks are aggressive because they struggle to regulate.", "No point in arguing with someone so badly informed on autism that they do not know that the symptoms vary by gender. Goodbye. You are not understanding not actually engaging with what i\u2019m saying."]}
