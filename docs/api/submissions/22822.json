I met Luke when  Julia was a freshman so I was aware that he offered to pay her schooling for 6 years, that was their deal. Luke started his adulthood with a lot of debt from school and didn't want Julia to go through any of that, he only wanted her to focus on getting an education. His business was successful so he paid for her tuition, apartment, car note, food, and other expenses (gas money, phone bill, clothing allowance, etc). He has spent close to $300,000 in 6 years. \n\nLuke and I run our businesses together and we combined finances after getting married, his business generates 10-15% more revenue than mine. Four months ago we had a discussion with Julia and asked her what her plans were regarding her future after school, she said she wanted to stay near her friends so Luke helped her secure a position where the starting salary was in the low six figure range. We decided that we would give her a rental property so that she would not pay rent, she would only be responsible for the utilities. \n\nSix weeks ago Julia's plans changed. She quit her job and told us that she wants to continue her education in the UK- a second Master's Degree and her PHD after. She's expecting us to pay for it. Luke discussed it with me and I told him that she should take out a loan. He paid for 6 years of schooling, pulled strings to get her into her career of choice, and we gave her a free place to stay. I don't think it's fair that we pay another $200-300,000 for Julia to avoid working and not deal with responsibilities. Luke agrees but he's a bit of a pushover. I reminded Luke that we have shared finances and my business brings in almost just as much as his, therefore I also have a say in this. \n\nJulia has been complaining to her parents and all of our relatives that I am denying her a chance to \"succeed at life.\" Luke's aunt says that it's only fair that we continue paying for her to attend university since Luke was the one who offered her a debt free education. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for putting my foot down and not allowing my husband to continue paying his sister's education since I bring in half of our income?

I think it\u2019s time sil realize that going to college isn\u2019t a job and it definitely isn\u2019t free.\n\nYou absolutely have the right to say no! Honestly who is so entitled that that think it\u2019s ok to keep sponging off their generous brother!  A brother that has actually alread went above and beyond for them! He should tell\nThe aunt he is all tapped out. Give her the tuition receipts for the $300,000 and tell her it her turn.\n\nAnd honestly if your husband caves you may want to rethink this relationship because he is putting his family before you. He is risking your financial security to cave to an entitled mooch! You have did enough! Tell them you will separate finances because you refuse to support a grown ass adult that is more then capable of making six figures. It\u2019s time sil put her big girl panties on and join the real world and be a functioning member of society or find her a rich sugar daddy to fund her!", "NTA at all. Luke sounds like a really great guy doing that for his sister, but it seems like she's beginning to take the p\\*ss here. And why does Luke's aunt feel that she has a say in the matter? You don't need 2 masters and a PHD to succeed in life wth. Your SIL sounds incredibly entitled and is essentially throwing all the help that you two have given in your faces.", "NTA by any means.   \nJulia should be grateful she was given an opportunity many people would kill for, especially if you're in the US. I'm not sure why she feels entitled to having her entire life financed by your husband as long as she manages to stay in school but the deal was 6 years, and truthfully he paid for a lot more for her than he needed to in order keep her out of debt. I'd make it VERY clear that this is a boundary you will not allow to be crossed. He should be making it clear it's a no from the both of you, not just you. Finances are shared now and their deal is over, she's not entitled to what you both work for. Especially after she gave up what is quite literally a great start to adulthood handed to her on a silver platter.   \n\n\nIt's clear she doesn't respect you and has been spoiled a bit too much by her striking lack of gratitude, why would you fund someone like that?", "NTA - she had a free ride through her masters.  You helped her get a job with a 6 figure salary and a rent free place.  If she wants a 2nd masters and PHD she can do that either after working to save up the $$$ or do it part  time while working full time to pay her own way.\n\nHer sense of entitlement is frightening.

Luke didn't just cover her tuition.  He completely financed her life for 6 years like he was her dad.  Then got her a job and bought her a place to live.  He has done more than enough for Julia.  It's time for her to adult.", "NTA.  Life changes, and Luke's life has changed and now he has a joint income with you.   If Auntie doesn't like it, she can pay up.", "NTA. Man a brother like that? I'd have felt pretty bad taking money from him if I was in Julia's shoes. NTA \n\nWhy isn't her parents paying for her tuition? That's not fair to your husband either.", "NTA. Julia obviously wants to be a career student so she never needs to work or support herself. Y\u2019all literally gave her everything she needs to succeed including a 6 figure job and a free living situation. She gets no more and if she wants further education she can work and save up to pay for it herself.", "This is crazy, you\u2019re NTA neither is Luke, Julia is TA and everyone who agrees with her. Like I\u2019m shocked at the entitlement.", "YTA for not helping her look into other options such as scholarships which are often available for PhDs.

He\u2019s already paid more than enough and gave her a lucrative career opportunity and she threw it away", "NTA\n\nShe HAS an education and got a good job and a home without huge payments.  She can work a few years, save, then if she really wants it, she can go to the UK and pay for her own continuing education if she wants a PhD.\n\nShe is an adult, and can support herself.  She doesn\u2019t need to be pampered further.", "NTA, but depending on her field she could potentially get a funded PhD. At least in the U.S., that\u2019s pretty common. I don\u2019t know about the UK, though.", "nta, there's a difference between helping someone and being taken advantage of. She should be more than grateful for what she's already been given", "NTA.  Luke was already more than generous covering as much as he had, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that.  But for Julia to start a career and basically become a self-reliant \u201cadult\u201d only to abandon it in favor of a second master\u2019s degree AND a PHD and keep expecting to get her free ride at your expense is incredibly entitled and spoiled.  She needs to grow TF up.", "What? No. Also, if she\u2019s not getting a funded PhD she\u2019s not good enough to be doing one anyway. Luke is an amazing brother but at a certain point she has to fly the coop, and his money is your money- no partner has the right to unilaterally spend a QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS. \n\nNTA, sounds like your SIL\u2019s expensive education hasn\u2019t taught her gratitude", "NTA.  This would be a hill to die on for me.  It was insanely generous of him to have paid for 6 years of her education.  She's proven that his generosity has turned her into an entitled, spoiled brat.  Tell all the Aunties and other family members they can all pony up to pay for her professional student status but you're tapped out.  You have combined finances now and this is WAY over the top.", "Is this actually real?  On what planet would this actually happen.  NTA", "NTA.  You and your husband have already put her squarely on third base.  If she can't finish it from here, that's on her.", "NTA, y'all have her a HUGE head start.

Just say, \"I agree, Aunt Julia, so glad to hear you will be helping Julia out! So Julia has a chance to succeed at life.\"", "NTA.\nShe has HAD an education. Your husband fulfilled his promise. \nIf she wants extra education, she can either get a loan or other family members can pay.\n\nThe audacity of your SIL & co is astounding. They should be embarrassed to be so shameless in asking for a 300k handout.", "Honestly sounds like Luke created a bit of a monster. She should have been working to cover at least some nominal costs for herself along the way, like groceries or utilities (I mean, he even gave her a *clothes allowance*?!). And then giving her a free place to stay *after* his promise was fulfilled, this is just wild. This girl is never going to learn to carry her own weight at this rate.", "She got the deal of a lifetime, the deal millions of young people dream about. The sort of deal you need a parent to be a multi millionaire and a pushover to get.\nAnd at this point she is complaining about unfairness?\n\nYour spouse made a massive mistake. He created a monster who doesn't understand reality and is going to spend her life unhappy that things require sacrifice, and anytime a boss just doesn't do run everything around her needs.\n\nBand aid needs to be ripped off, and she has to meet the real world.", "She\u2019s one of those people who realized school is wayyyy easier than real life (as long as someone\u2019s paying for school, of course). I mean yeah I\u2019d love to just be in college forever haha, sounds awesome. I\u2019d be a deadbeat to ask my parents to subsidize my lifestyle while I acted like van wilder. \n\nNTA I\u2019d make this my hill to die on.", "Came here to say this. The ENTITLEMENT!  Rather than being eternally grateful for being given six years of school and life expenses she is complaining because she can\u2019t have more. I\u2019m disgusted.", "She's figured out how to have a sugar daddy she doesn't have to bang!", "This is true for STEM subject, but sadly in humanities (at least in the UK) it's quite common to do unfunded PhDs, even in Oxbridge.", "I could only dream of making $100k fresh off my masters, in fact I don't even earn that much over 10 years later \ud83d\ude2d", "Exactly.  I would detail EVERYTHING he has already paid, for emphasising the fact that she has finished her education, has a Bachelor's AND a Masters, dumped a highly paid job,  and now wants to avoid working and be a student again.\n\nThey may not be getting the full story, or understand the costs.", "Who are those people ?", "Absolutely!", "The most sensible comment on this post.", "The UK system is complicated and most funding is for domestic students only but yes she will have some options.", "To all the above - I actually did a PhD abroad and figuring out how the other country works etc is often quite difficult and having some support helps A LOT. Intelligence has nothing to do with it. It's also a massive thing to do it literally turns your life inside out and for many is quite scary.\n\nI'm not saying OP should fund it, because I agree they shouldn't, but it sounded like they were writing off helping her at all when some basic support helping her look into funding options or basic advice like telling her to find out who she needs to email etc (not always clear from uni websites) or helping her figure out how another country's system works (the uk PhD funding system is complicated) - even if she does the actual searching and work herself - would be a much better solution than going \"no help at all\". It's also not unlikely that after being in education so long she could even afford the visas herself, it can run into hundreds of pounds.\n\nAnd for the record postgraduate study abroad and having experience of another country/culture is good for career prospects. \n\nStraight up funding her no but there's other ways to be supportive and OP does not sound supportive at all, while their partner seems to think money solves everything.", "Even scarier is that the family agree with her.", "Ikr, I would have LOVED this deal! She sounds so entitled and spoiled rotten.", "So in my Masters program we had the option of a thesis, project, or exam at the end and the prof that coordinated everything would actively talk try and talk students out of the thesis route unless they planned to do a PhD and if you planned on doing one then she was doing her best to suck you into a teaching position so she could secure her retirement.", "I\u2019d argue that getting a funded PhD in the humanities is even more critical given job prospects", "I hear you.  I worked in education before disability took me out.  I was thrilled to break $50K a couple of years back.", "God forbid, if Luke dies or becomes unable to work, what happens then? Has he set up a trust to take care of them? This whole thing sounds WAY too precarious....", "They probably don't have a clue how much her education costs\n Send them a spread sheet", "Having actually done similar myself a little support/advice/general help goes a long way. It is not simple to find out what you need to know to do this. At all. She doesn't necessarily need financial help (although visas can be bloody expensive) but OP could be less jealous the SIL had help and be supportive at least.\n\nFor the record while my parents helped with my rent while doing my undergrad/integrated masters (basically 4-year undergrad) and assisted with flights etc (cos I was on the other side of the planet) they were in no position to fund me entirely so like most I have a ton of student debt from undergrad and was only able to do a PhD because of a full ride scholarship during which I paid all my own way visas rent bills the lot.", "Then they can pay.", "Yes yes yes yes yes. I went to social science PhD school with full funding for 4 years. I quit when the funding ran out. I know lots of people who kept going on loans and cobbled-together poverty teaching stipends for YEARS. Almost none of them ended up with jobs in their field, even if they finished the degree, and of those who did, only one or two have full time jobs with a living wage. I would have absolutely financially hamstrung myself for the remainder of my adult working life if I had taken out loans for the amount of time it would have taken me to complete the degree (protip: in the social sciences and humanities it nearly always takes several years longer than you think it\u2019s going to).  It is imperative that prospective PhD students in the humanities not enter a degree program unless they receive funding, are independently wealthy, or have a wealthy patron to pay for it. \n\nNTA, OP. She needs to stand on her own two feet for this one.", "I doubt that anyone is gonna check whether your phd was self funded or not, once it's in your cv.\n\nIn academia, what counts is your networking + your papers + name and connections of your supervisor\n\nIn industry, only thing that really matters is the name of the uni", "OP's husband has funded this girl's life for how many years now?  All of her expenses have been entirely taken care to this very day.  Exactly how much more help, advice or support is she supposed to get before she the, you know, adult thing?  \n\nI don't think the OP is jealous.  Not at all.  She's being pragmatic and sensible about her family's future.  Very few people can afford to essentially give away a few hundred thousand dollars to pay for someone else's choices and lifestyle.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the SIL wanting to further her education.  It's time she started footing the bill(s) for it, though.", "It\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s \u201cif a university isn\u2019t willing to pay you for this research then maybe the research isn\u2019t worth doing\u201d.", "More like \"the system is broken and should be radically changed, since it was devised for noblemen of the late XIX century and it's been losing funding in the last 50 years\".\n\nAlso humanities funding are usually super random. Since faculties have almost zero money themselves, they often try to get them from charities or whatever organisation they can find. I've heard of people getting a scholarship for a STEM PhD simply because they played an instrument in an orchestra when they were 15 and there was an organisation specifically putting out money for former music players, do you think that their research was more important than someone else's without their same luck? Lmao", "There\u2019s also loads of STEM research not worth doing. The scholarships they get for no good reason are rubbish, I agree with you. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I also agree the system doesn\u2019t work and should be changed. But this is the system and this is the framework I have to give my answer in."]}
