I met Luke when  Julia was a freshman so I was aware that he offered to pay her schooling for 6 years, that was their deal. Luke started his adulthood with a lot of debt from school and didn't want Julia to go through any of that, he only wanted her to focus on getting an education. His business was successful so he paid for her tuition, apartment, car note, food, and other expenses (gas money, phone bill, clothing allowance, etc). He has spent close to $300,000 in 6 years. \n\nLuke and I run our businesses together and we combined finances after getting married, his business generates 10-15% more revenue than mine. Four months ago we had a discussion with Julia and asked her what her plans were regarding her future after school, she said she wanted to stay near her friends so Luke helped her secure a position where the starting salary was in the low six figure range. We decided that we would give her a rental property so that she would not pay rent, she would only be responsible for the utilities. \n\nSix weeks ago Julia's plans changed. She quit her job and told us that she wants to continue her education in the UK- a second Master's Degree and her PHD after. She's expecting us to pay for it. Luke discussed it with me and I told him that she should take out a loan. He paid for 6 years of schooling, pulled strings to get her into her career of choice, and we gave her a free place to stay. I don't think it's fair that we pay another $200-300,000 for Julia to avoid working and not deal with responsibilities. Luke agrees but he's a bit of a pushover. I reminded Luke that we have shared finances and my business brings in almost just as much as his, therefore I also have a say in this. \n\nJulia has been complaining to her parents and all of our relatives that I am denying her a chance to \"succeed at life.\" Luke's aunt says that it's only fair that we continue paying for her to attend university since Luke was the one who offered her a debt free education. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for putting my foot down and not allowing my husband to continue paying his sister's education since I bring in half of our income?

Your husband has done his part. He helped more then anyone else would! I think it\u2019s time sil realize that going to college isn\u2019t a job and it definitely isn\u2019t free.\n\nYou absolutely have the right to say no! Honestly who is so entitled that that think it\u2019s ok to keep sponging off their generous brother!  A brother that has actually alread went above and beyond for them! He should tell\nThe aunt he is all tapped out. Give her the tuition receipts for the $300,000 and tell her it her turn.\n\nAnd honestly if your husband caves you may want to rethink this relationship because he is putting his family before you. He is risking your financial security to cave to an entitled mooch! You have did enough! Tell them you will separate finances because you refuse to support a grown ass adult that is more then capable of making six figures. It\u2019s time sil put her big girl panties on and join the real world and be a functioning member of society or find her a rich sugar daddy to fund her!", "NTA at all. Luke sounds like a really great guy doing that for his sister, but it seems like she's beginning to take the p\\*ss here. And why does Luke's aunt feel that she has a say in the matter? You don't need 2 masters and a PHD to succeed in life wth. Your SIL sounds incredibly entitled and is essentially throwing all the help that you two have given in your faces.", "NTA by any means.   \nJulia should be grateful she was given an opportunity many people would kill for, especially if you're in the US. I'm not sure why she feels entitled to having her entire life financed by your husband as long as she manages to stay in school but the deal was 6 years, and truthfully he paid for a lot more for her than he needed to in order keep her out of debt. I'd make it VERY clear that this is a boundary you will not allow to be crossed. He should be making it clear it's a no from the both of you, not just you. Finances are shared now and their deal is over, she's not entitled to what you both work for. Especially after she gave up what is quite literally a great start to adulthood handed to her on a silver platter.   \n\n\nIt's clear she doesn't respect you and has been spoiled a bit too much by her striking lack of gratitude, why would you fund someone like that?", "NTA - she had a free ride through her masters.  You helped her get a job with a 6 figure salary and a rent free place.  If she wants a 2nd masters and PHD she can do that either after working to save up the $$$ or do it part  time while working full time to pay her own way.\n\nHer sense of entitlement is frightening.

NTA.\n\nShe should be ***extremely*** grateful for the leg up her brother has given her and instead is being entitled. This would be my hill to die on and I wouldn't give her another cent.", "NTA.\nSomehow it seems additionally annoying that she quit the job first and informed you only later.", "NTA.  Luke didn't just cover her tuition.  He completely financed her life for 6 years like he was her dad.  Then got her a job and bought her a place to live.  He has done more than enough for Julia.  It's time for her to adult.", "NTA.  Life changes, and Luke's life has changed and now he has a joint income with you.   If Auntie doesn't like it, she can pay up.", "NTA. Man a brother like that? I'd have felt pretty bad taking money from him if I was in Julia's shoes. NTA \n\nWhy isn't her parents paying for her tuition? That's not fair to your husband either.", "NTA. Julia obviously wants to be a career student so she never needs to work or support herself. Y\u2019all literally gave her everything she needs to succeed including a 6 figure job and a free living situation. She gets no more and if she wants further education she can work and save up to pay for it herself.", "This is crazy, you\u2019re NTA neither is Luke, Julia is TA and everyone who agrees with her. Like I\u2019m shocked at the entitlement.", "YTA for not helping her look into other options such as scholarships which are often available for PhDs. If she already has a US masters she probably has no need to do a uk one, in fact you can (technically) go straight from bachelors to PhD in the uk (although this rarely happens for competitive and other reasons).", "NTA. He\u2019s already paid more than enough and gave her a lucrative career opportunity and she threw it away", "NTA\n\nShe HAS an education and got a good job and a home without huge payments.  She can work a few years, save, then if she really wants it, she can go to the UK and pay for her own continuing education if she wants a PhD.\n\nShe is an adult, and can support herself.  She doesn\u2019t need to be pampered further.", "NTA, but depending on her field she could potentially get a funded PhD. At least in the U.S., that\u2019s pretty common. I don\u2019t know about the UK, though.", "nta, there's a difference between helping someone and being taken advantage of. She should be more than grateful for what she's already been given", "NTA.  Luke was already more than generous covering as much as he had, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that.  But for Julia to start a career and basically become a self-reliant \u201cadult\u201d only to abandon it in favor of a second master\u2019s degree AND a PHD and keep expecting to get her free ride at your expense is incredibly entitled and spoiled.  She needs to grow TF up.", "What? No. Also, if she\u2019s not getting a funded PhD she\u2019s not good enough to be doing one anyway. Luke is an amazing brother but at a certain point she has to fly the coop, and his money is your money- no partner has the right to unilaterally spend a QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS. \n\nNTA, sounds like your SIL\u2019s expensive education hasn\u2019t taught her gratitude", "NTA.  This would be a hill to die on for me.  It was insanely generous of him to have paid for 6 years of her education.  She's proven that his generosity has turned her into an entitled, spoiled brat.  Tell all the Aunties and other family members they can all pony up to pay for her professional student status but you're tapped out.  You have combined finances now and this is WAY over the top.", "Is this actually real?  On what planet would this actually happen.  NTA", "NTA.  You and your husband have already put her squarely on third base.  If she can't finish it from here, that's on her.", "NTA, y'all have her a HUGE head start.

I get being mad about the situation and that's completely acceptable because it's not just school he also got her a starting job that pays more than probably 60% to 75% of the population will ever have a shot at and gave her a home on top of that but to make any marriage work you have to be willing to compromise otherwise it will just breed resentment.
