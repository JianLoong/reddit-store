Since freshman year of high school, they have been practically inseparable.\n\nMore recently though, Sara and James had started college. Although, James has always been smarter and is currently attending one of the Ivy Leagues on the Northern East Coast. Sara on the other hand, did not have the same abilities. She attended a small D1 school in North Carolina. School is about to end in 2 weeks and summer will begin.\n\nSara and James have kept there relationship going through late night calls and frequent visits. For the past 6 months, me and my wife have been saving up for a trip to the Bahamas (we have always wanted to go there). Unfortunately though, we are not able to afford 2 extra tickets. Which means, I have only been planning to bring my daughter. \n\nLast week though, I found out my daughter has been cheating on James with a senior from her college. More unfortunately, James had to witness it. Sara uses a small camera on her computer to call James. After their call one night, I guess Sara forgot to turn off the camera. James and his friends were hanging out at one of their dorms when he got a notification on his phone. It was the camera app. He opened it to his dismay, witnessing Sara and John (senior from school) having intercourse. James immediately took screenshots (not of anything graphic) and saved the video to his phone.\n\nHe confronted Sara the next day, which of course she denied it. James showed the photos and evidence- which resulted in Sara breaking down. Further digging revealed that her and John had been doing this for the past 6 months.  James of course broke down and drove home, actually calling my wife and alerting us. \n\nWe immediately supported him and messaged Sara. This is not how we raised our daughter. Ultimately though, we have decided to take James on our family trip to the Bahamas in 2 weeks after school ends. We told Sara this which resulted in a huge fight between her and my wife, but we aren\u2019t budging. \n\nWhat do you think? Should I be on my daughters side?

Either this story is made up or this already happened and OP is asking for opinions after the fact. \n\nIdk, maybe they are in summer sessions. So if it's real, YTA for taking your kid's (hopefully) ex on a vacation.", "YTA, you can condem her behavior without treating her less than.\n\n>More recently though, Sara and James had started college. Although, James has always been smarter and is currently attending one of the Ivy Leagues on the Northern East Coast. Sara on the other hand, did not have the same abilities. She attended a small D1 school in North Carolina. School is about to end in 2 weeks and summer will begin.\n\nWhat was the point of this whole paragraph? This alone made me think YTA. All you needed to say is they go to different schools, not how dumb your daughter is compared to her bf.", "YTA. You are way overstepping. Your daughter is not treating James very well, and you're entitled to have feelings about that. But you are trying to punish your daughter by doing this is not only inappropriate, but will damage your relationship with her way into her adulthood. James is not your son. He'll move on with his life. Your daughter will always be your daughter. If you don't want to take your daughter on the trip, don't. But take another friend or family member.", "YTA\n\nAre you planning on adopting him or becoming a throuple?", "Honestly I don't think either of them should go. Your daughter for the cheating situation and James for not actually being part of your family unit. The situation is a little awkward and bringing him on holiday would only make it more so as you're her parents. Whilst you didn't commit the crime maybe you should speak with him first to see if it's something he is comfortable with. \n\nYour daughter will have more boyfriends and make more mistakes it's life. Sounds like you wanted him to become your SIL and bringing him along on holiday is only further proof of that. He's not family so you need to move on from him and allow him space.", "I don\u2019t know what to say. Why are you so enmeshed in your daughter\u2019s dating life? Why are you taking sides? Who is the bf to you that you\u2019re punishing your daughter so that he feels supported? Is it like a son that you never had kind of thing?\n\nYTA. You can criticise her actions and even be apologetic to the bf, but always choose your own child. And don\u2019t get so entangled with her SOs. They are bound to change.", "Look, you are way too invested here. I get it, you like James, you wished your daughter was so \"lucky\" to end up with a smart kid like him, you saw him grow up as well etc etc.... So I am being lenient in this concrete instance...\n\nAlso what your daughter did was certainly not OK , but to James, not to you...It has nothing to do with you. \n\nIf you are that disappointed in her for cheating in a long-term relationship I think it would be somewhat acceptable to not take her on the trip this year, but that's it. \n\nIt is definitely not ok to take James instead, nor is it okay to invite him to Christmas, b-day parties etc etc...if he stays your daughter's Ex. I had a feeling these might happen, so I am telling you now. You would need to say your goodbye to JAmes if you want to keep a relationship with your daughter in the future", "YTA if this is true. You need to butt out of your adult daughter's life and seriously consider therapy.\n\nEdit: I just caught something in your OP. You said the colleges are about to start summer break. Really? You slipped up on that one.", "YTA. You don't HAVE to take sides; butt out. You can tell your daughter you're disappointed, angry etc without taking her ex on holiday with you. That's just bloody odd behaviour on your part. \n\n'James has always been smarter and is currently attending one of the Ivy Leagues on the Northern East Coast. Sara on the other hand, did not have the same abilities. She attended a small D1 school in North Carolina'\n\nSo...you basically want James to be your son and want to ditch your daughter? This whole paragraph screams AH parents to me.", "Reprimanding your daughter is good also telling her how her action was reprehensible and might cause really good relationships to suffer is also good. But bring her now ex bf to a vacation is weird, feels more like you want to make a statement to her and also why are you so close to her ex bf? \n\nYTA imo.", "YTA.  Your post makes it sound like you like James over your own daughter.  Also, this breakup and relationship are none of your business.  You cannot punish your adult daughter for how she handles her relationships.  You can give advice where solicited, disagree with her life choices and provide condolences and comfort where needed but at no point should punishment ever be used as a method about a personal relationship.", "ESH what your daughter did was awful and if you don\u2019t want to spend time with her, that\u2019s reasonable, but to bring the ex bf instead seems like a punishment for your daughter, and she\u2019s too old for you to be exacting a punishment. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why you put their academic performance in the info at all. Your behavior towards your daughter seems extra punitive in light of that.", "ESH\n\nThis\u2026 is tragic.  There\u2019s honestly no right answer.  No one knows your family as well as you do.  Just do what feels right at the time and don\u2019t second guess it.\n\nKeep in mind that your daughter is not a child and it\u2019s not your responsibility to punish her for how she carries herself in her adult relationships.  Also, not sure why the academic credentials were brought into this.", "One day your daughter will be graduating, getting married and having kids, etc. And you'll be home with her ex bf instead of in the audience at graduation and walking her down the aisle and playing with your grandchildren because you traded her for the ex bf. YTA", "Good Lord man.  Do you not remember *anything* about being a teenager/young adult?  Can you name a single high school romance that survived separation when they went to different schools?  This is a clich\u00e9 because it's the most likely outcome.\n\nYour daughter and her ex will both learn and grow from this.  It's all part of growing up.  \n\nYTA.", "ESH. Your daughter for cheating and you for taking him to a vacation, that is totally unnecessary. It is understandable if you want to have less contact with her or something like that but to me it sounds like you like him more than her with the whole first part telling that he is smarter so that makes you an even more AH.", "YTA. Your kid did something messed up for sure, but that\u2019s still your kid, james isn\u2019t. Let his parents parent him and you parent your daughter.", "Wow\u2026. I have to say YTA. This is just such a weird thing to do. You have every right to kick your daughter off the trip you\u2019re paying for. You\u2019re angry, disappointed, disgusted by her behaviour. You don\u2019t want to spend a week with her at a resort. I get it. \nBut taking James? That\u2019s so bizarre. He\u2019s not her husband, not father of your grandchildren. He\u2019s her high school (ex?) boyfriend. Their relationship is over, it\u2019s time to cut those strings.  Leave this between the two of them. \n\nIdeally, in time you would be able to forgive your daughter and move on. Walk her down the aisle one day. To take James on the trip in my opinion destroys your future relationship as well. You know nothing of what has gone one between the two of them for the last 5 years. Leave it for them to sort this out.", "YTA. You have no business putting your two cents in your adult daughter's dating life, and you definitely have no business kicking her out of the family (even in a temporary capacity like removing her from vacation).", "ESH.\n\nOnce your kids leave the house--to go to university or whatever--their lives are their own. \n\nGetting right in the middle of your daughter's relationship(s) is not an option. It's her life now, and your meddling will only bring ill will (which it already has).\n\nOpting to bring her *old boyfriend* on a \"family trip\"--rather than your own daughter--makes absolutely no sense at all. You might really like the old bf, but he's certainly not family.\n\n\n> James of course broke down and drove home, actually calling my wife and alerting us.\n\n> We immediately supported him and messaged Sara. This is not how we raised our daughter.\n\nYou can tell your daughter how disappointed you are in her. But inviting her (soon to be) ex along with you, rather than your own flesh and blood, is just plain nutty. \n\nYour daughter needs parents who are mature and \"on her side.\" You might consider some counseling to better understand this.", "YTA\n\nIt's understandable that you're upset, particularly if you're fond of James.  You do, however, need to butt out of your daughter's business.  You don't want to take her on the trip, that's fine but life happens and if your daughter decided this is how she wanted to treat her boyfriend, it's her mess to deal with.  She's in college and doesn't need mommy/daddy dealing with her dating life.  Tell her you're disappointed if you must, but to be honest with you, it wasn't James's place to \"alert your wife and you.\"  What happens between them should have stayed between them.  Butt out.", ">What do you think? Should I be on my daughters side? Should I bring her?\n\nI don't really agree at all, but clan politics (which is what I'm going to call this, because you're treating James as a member of the close-knit \"family\") are harsh, and it's not like that's so because the situations are frivolous and light. You're entitled to your methods, and there is only one party that has done wrong.\n\nNTA.\n\n(Edit: I think the posters who think the only right thing for you to do is \"butt out\" of the relationship should apply the same reasoning toward Sarah regarding your interaction with James. Her relationship is not a private matter, not at five years long, and affects more than just the two of them.)", "YTA\n\nThere is no way this post is real. How would you know all those details? But which parent would pick an outsider over their own adult child to take on vacation? If punishment was required, the parents would usually go on vacation without the adult child. But who would bring an outsider along instead of their own adult child? That's so messed up.", " YTA! From your tone about your daughter before getting to the punchline, you\u2019re a condescending insufferable dad. You\u2019re daughter doesn\u2019t need nor deserve your judgement about her academics or her love life. \n\nShe cheated. That\u2019s between her and James. You shouldn\u2019t be involved in anyway. Crappy parents choosing a boyfriend over your daughter. She did wrong and will pay the price without your bizarre interference.", "Your daughter is young. You should support her though good and bad decisions. \n\nYTA", "Seeing you talk about your daughter having \u201cintercourse\u201d \u2014 I guess because you thought we needed explicit details even though you already said James had witnessed cheating; we get it! \u2014 is icky. Get out of their personal lives. And do not take James on vacation. I shudder to imagine the conversations.\n\nThe idea that James came tattling to you (with the evidence!?) is gross. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve heard Sara\u2019s side. Maybe she\u2019s been trying to dump James. Maybe he\u2019s as condescending about her as you are and she got sick of it and John treats her better.", "Nta. Cheaters deserve punishment", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
