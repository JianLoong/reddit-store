If you\u2019re going to snitch someone\u2019s food, make sure you\u2019re not allergic to it.", "NTA, Rob should not have touched something that was not his. And he should have asked, because if he had, he would have been told.\n\nTell him it is time to learn what shrimp look and smell like.", "NTA. Rob is old enough to know he shouldn\u2019t be eating food when he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in it due to his allergies. I would never eat someone\u2019s leftovers without asking first. \n\nAlso names in other languages are still names. Even if I don\u2019t know the language, names are still pretty distinguishable.", "NTA. He\u2019s 15. That\u2019s old enough not to eat someone else\u2019s food without 1) asking permission and 2) confirming the ingredients. You shouldn\u2019t have to label your food (helps sometimes when you need to distinguish your to-go box from someone else\u2019s though) but even if you hadn\u2019t labeled it, Rob is old enough not to be helping himself to whatever food he wants in someone else\u2019s house. Even if you don\u2019t have an allergy, you don\u2019t do that.", "NTA. How about Rob not helping himself to food that\u2019s not his. Also, he\u2019s 15, old enough to know not to eat food when he doesn\u2019t know what ingredients are in it.", "NTA. That's weird he ate your leftovers without asking", "NTA the kid more or less stole from you. if you had offered him a dish with shrimp then you are the asshole but he got into shit that wasn't his.", "NTA- It was labeled.

NTA.", "Not to mentioned the food is in a leftover container that is *clearly* not his and belongs to someone else!", "My kid is 3 and dairy free for dietary reasons. He asks if food has cheese or milk super regularly. And if something *looks* like it might be cheese he asks me to make sure. He\u2019s 3 and his issue with dairy wouldn\u2019t cause more than a day or two of discomfort, no hospitalization. 15yo has no excuses here. NTA.", "I'm allergic to bell peppers.

I would never take food from someone else's fridge without clarifying what is in the container and asking the specific question - does this have nuts in it?\n\nRob is 15 and he knows that he has a severe allergy. He should also know that it's rude to eat other people's food. The responsibility is on him and his dad.", "I\u2019m going to guess the name wasn\u2019t in the Latin alphabet, so he couldn\u2019t read it. Still, he should have noticed the wrong ingredients.", "This. As a former pre-school teachers, my students with allergies, even at 3-6 years old, were very aware of what their allergies were. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean we didn\u2019t watch still, but most of them would say, hey I can\u2019t have that when they encountered something they thought might be an allergen. At 15, I would expect him to be able to ID a shrimp and not eat it and know to stay away from unknown things if it\u2019s a level of allergy that required hospitalization. \n\nIDing their allergen and not eating things they didn\u2019t know were basic things that kids with allergies should learn as soon as possible, especially if it\u2019s a serious allergy. 15 is old enough that this should be part of life for him now.", "I just had a thought: what if Rob asked the sister what it said, and she told him \"oh that's just OP's name\"??

I also won't eat leftovers that aren't mine without permission at my own home. Leftovers belong to the person that brought them home so you shouldn't eat them without permission.", "Right? This is so wild to me for a 15 year old kid with an allergy to just eat some unlabeled whatever.  My 6 year old has been managing his own food allergy for half his life with no issues.", "Same! I'm allergic to bell peppers as well, and when I tell people, they think I'm faking it.\n\nMy mom tested it to see if I was faking it when I went to visit. She's not testing me anymore.", "In a language the 15 YEAR OLD doesn\u2019t read.", "Depends how bad the allergy is, which is why I\u2019m asking. Some people can die if they touch a cross contaminated object or breathe in air where it was cooked. \n\nIf OP\u2019s sister made a point to tell everyone about it, it seems more serious than just \u201che can\u2019t eat shrimp.\u201d", "Even if he had permission to eat what he finds, he knows he has an allergy.", "My cousin's kid was good at asking at this age for holiday parties. \"Mom can I have this?
