What was Rob told about helping himself?\n\nA friend of mine has roots in India, their family visits for several weeks to several months. He's even invited me for a period of that duration (I haven't accepted because I'm queer (which my friend knows) and don't want to cause issues).\nFrom what he tells me, his family often tells their guests to make themselves at home. For adults, it's of course obvious that's a nuanced invitation: don't expect someone will make your bed, but do attend family meals with nice manners etc.\nStill, I could see how a teenager would tell himself it would be okay to eat something without asking, esp if the only marking is in an alphabet he can't read.

All bullshit IMO because he certainly knew whatever it said wasn\u2019t \u201cRob\u201d and he could have asked before helping himself.

Some shell fish allergies are so deadly that people with them can\u2019t breathe in air where it\u2019s been cooked, or touch things that have been cross contaminated without going into shock. \n\nSo since we know OP\u2019s sister made a point to tell everyone about the allergy, it really makes me wonder if OP was told the kid had a deadly allergy, brought home shrimp anyway, and now is trying to play it off as \u201cI didn\u2019t write it in English on the box.\u201d", "NTA, as a person with a food allergy I have been cautious since I was very young (6/7 years old) of what I ate.", "NTA if you labelled it in a language that he obviously doesn\u2019t know then it means the food wasn\u2019t his, so he caused his own allergic reaction", "NTA.
