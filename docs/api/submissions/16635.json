The food is not contaminated because we used serving spoons. The leftover did look like takeout.\n\n2) In my culture, we eat out/order in a lot because the food is cheap. We have several boxes of food we ordered in the fridge. We don\u2019t write anything on them though, so mine should stand out for this reason.\n\n3) My language does not use Roman alphabet. \n\n4) Rob ate the food at like 6 in the morning.

One kid I know read labels on everything at like 5 (obviously didn't know all the words, was just scanning for the one word that mattered), and asked about everything that wasn't known for certain to be safe (like if the bread was a different brand than usual - ask a parent). The kid wasn't super careful about things in general, still a normal kid doing dumb shit all the time, but careful about this one lethal hazard. \n\nTeenagers are dumb and reckless, but that doesn't mean they're dumb and reckless about everything. Kids who grow up with serious food allergies can be just as dumb and reckless as any other teen about other shit, and anal about unfamiliar food. \n\nThis teen experienced an unfortunate natural consequence of his lapse of judgment. No serious harm done thankfully, and he'll be more careful in the future, which will serve him well.", "Maybe they didn't, doesn't change the fact she should have labeled it.", "Good for you, but amazingly you aren't all teenagers. And I am willing to bet all the money in the fucking world that you did some other stupid shit when you where a teenager. Why isn't so hard for people to understand that teenagers, including themselves, are kind of stupid? There is a reason we don't let them drink or smoke or have sex with people over 18 or enter a legally binding contract without a parent's consent, teenagers are more likely to make bad decisions than adults.", "OP had their name on it, even if the kid couldn't read it it was still labeled and is a universal sign of \"this is my food\"", "Again 15 years old. He probably didn't even think about it or that anyone would have cared.", "That's his issue, not OP's.", "You're not necessarily the asshole, but you were all very inconsiderate of Rob. You knew you had a guest with severe allergens staying over, it's good to be considerate of that and in the future, assuming Rob is still around, always, always, label the leftovers.", "YTA..... allergies are very serious, and obviously people die because of them. It wouldn't have taken you long to use I don't know, fucking Google translate, to put something on the box, it's just being a decent human being.", "Nta. My 6 yr old daughter can remember that her 12 month old hrother cant have peanuts but a teenage boy cant be careful about the food he is consuming when he has an allergy? Just because he cant read the label on the box doesnt mean he is unable to tell it is someone elses meal. I dont know how things are there but here we dont take other peoples things without asking.", "NTA. If it was just a rash and he\u2019s fine, then it sounds like a valuable lesson learned lol", "NTA.

I've known since I was a small child to never eat anything that I didn't know all the ingredients of and that I was responsible for my own allergies. A 15 yr old in a foreign country where he doesn't speak the language shouldn't be randomly eating anything. Although if I were you, knowing a child was in the home that didn't speak or write the language, I wouldn't have brought a shrimp dish home. I'd have offered the leftovers to someone else or honestly just ordered something else in the first place. Still not your fault but would have been a kind thing to do when you knew the situation.", "NTA he helped himself to someone else\u2019s food", "NTA. He's old enough to know to not eat something if he doesn't know what's in there.", "NTA. A teenager allergic to good should\u2019ve known better.

Did you actually consider that you were bringing shrimps into the house where he's allergic when you did so, and did your sister ask you to keep them out of the house, or just not to feed them to the kid?", "I know a kid that's 8, and he doesn't take food from the fridge that he doesn't know the ingredient of, I feel sorry for rob, but maybe that's why you don't Rob \\[haha get it, you may now post an angry response to the joke below\\] the frige of food that you dont know what is in it,", "Especially when he knows he\u2019s allergic to shrimp", "years ago when i was a cub scout leader i had this one kid who was allergic to eggs, kid was 10 years old. one day during camp we had the kids make pancakes (he got something different ofcourse) and he asked us multiple times if we had made sure the bottle of soda he picked up to refill his drink hadn't been touched by a pancakemix hand. 15 year old should be aware enough not to eat random food he finds", "Will never forget eating out at an American style diner for a Uni reunion, a fellow attendee - \u201centitled\u201d comes to mind - kept dipping her straw into other people\u2019s milkshakes to taste their flavour/s\u2026 until she did it for the last time, looked up and went \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m allergic to peanuts\u201d and she\u2019d happened to come across someone else\u2019s peanut butter milkshake. \n\nI didn\u2019t even know this chick that well but everyone else was acting pretty lacklustre, so I just got her into my car immediately and we went straight to Emergency.

But seriously, she was in her mid-20s with a serious food allergy, and no boundaries whatsoever. \n\nMade it all the worse later when I found out she did actually have an Epipen (adrenaline shot) on her, but didn\u2019t want to use it because they\u2019re expensive to replace\u2026 Like $100!", "Bell peppers can indicate a nighshade allergy, which is what I have. Peppers, tomatoes, and potatoes are off the list for me, among other things, and agreed that I would never eat something without knowing what the ingredients are, especially since so much has nightshades in it and people tend to forget that plant family is massive (and are either hot or often combined with things that are hot/spicy so they don't realize they're having an allergic response because it gets masked unless they get full on hives or anaphylaxis).\n\nKid's 15 with a common allergy that this served as a good reminder to not eat random food and to ask if something contains shrimp before eating it, to say nothing of not eating food at someone else's house without permission, particularly from a takeaway container.", "Wouldn\u2019t a decent human being not eat other peoples food when they don\u2019t even know what it is?", "I mean this is cool and so wonderful but uhh not every kid is your 9 year old\n\nWild I know", "My kid is 6 and doesn't have any allergies, and isn't the most switched on kid.

Yes. i made stupid other mistakes as a teenager. because as you say, dumb-teens/kids without fully formed brains and often lack of some impulse control. but!! from the time i was at least 8 i knew not to mess around with just eating random foods with unknown ingredients that could kill me or land me in hospital. \n\nSame for my girlfriend. \n\nMany people you are talking to here may be adults now. but were once kids and teens with food allergies and were taught early on to be mindful of that one-thing, at the very least. \n\nOP is NTA.", "Precisely and exactly the point. \n\nHe didn\u2019t think when he should have. \n\nAs a 15yo in an unfamiliar and likely somewhat uncomfortable new environment, it\u2019s entirely understandable, but doesn\u2019t change the underlying reality that he is, or will soon be, solely responsible for his own health/well-being. \n\nKid learned an important lesson\u2026 No need to blame him but\u2026 Disempowering him by blaming the consequences of his own actions on someone entirely *not* at fault, is not helpful.
