If you really want to teach him a lesson (I mean that literally, as opposed to just punishing him) a better method is to give him a taste of what it's like to have a disability. When I was working with seniors, we did an exercise in which you would wear gloves with Popsicle sticks in the fingers, and a couple the fingers sewn together, as well as having the sleeve of your arm attached with an elastic to the hem of your shirt, we wore  glasses that made things fuzzy, and had earplugs in so that we couldn't really hear. Then you had to find your way to a table and eat. It actually gave you a sense of what certain disabilities are like, rather than just being a punishment that doesn't really teach compassion.", "YTA if a bib is nothing to make fun of, why are you using it as a punishment? I get youare trying to teach your kid a lesson but trying to humiliate them by making them like a disabled kid is ableist and probably traumatising to your kid.", "Soft YTA. You\u2019re trying to correct the problem but forcing him to wear a bib won\u2019t teach empathy. He\u2019ll just be pissed at you and won\u2019t understand the assignment. It\u2019s why punishment doesn\u2019t work. \n\nBefore anyone starts the whole I walk the straight and narrow because of punishments\u2026.good for you. Sucks you needed to be scared to do the right thing instead of doing it just because it\u2019s right.", "Soft YTA. I think it's appropriate but a month is a bit too long. I read your comment about him wearing it at school too? His peers might tease/bully him and his feelings might turn into resentment towards disabled people.", "ESH. Your child does need to learn empathy, but you're reinforcing the \"mockability\" of someone who wears a bib when, really, adult bibs would be a good idea for many messy eaters, including me. You're also making more work for the teacher. His refusal to apologize is definitely a problem. Maybe explain to him a lesson he will probably need someday: convicts get shorter sentences if they show remorse.", "You are absolutely the asshole. There's a difference between teaching a lesson and being vindictive. You crossed that line when you made them wear it past 1 meal. I mean this is the most respectful manner, but just based off this, it seems like they're learning their behavior from you.", "YTA, this is a cruel and disproportionate response. The behavior needs to be addressed, but this is not the way", "YTA: I'm going to take a guess that you had shitty parents that gave out stupid punishments like this.", "Soft YTA, but not because you\u2019re making him wear a bib. I don\u2019t get why people are saying that\u2019s wrong, your showing him what it feels like to be made fun of for being different. My grandmother was the type to make us wear \u201ccheap clothes\u201d (ex: Walmart brand) if we made fun of kids who did wear that. To show that clothes are clothes, so long as your covered and they\u2019re clean there\u2019s nothing wrong with them. \n\nBut I\u2019m confused about the refusal to apologize? Are you waiting for him to come around? My mother would have made me write a letter and read it at the front of the class and I better read it right too (no mumbling). \n\nHave you had a discussion with him about the true nature of his actions? Sometimes kids don\u2019t understand the gravity of what they\u2019re doing. Have you explain that the other child was born this way and it\u2019s no fault of his own. Have him and example like what if someone made fun of him, or a sibling or you or daddy? How it\u2019d make him feel, especially if it was over something you guys couldn\u2019t control. Have you been honest that if he keeps up that behavior he could cause someone to hurt themselves? I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t want that and wouldn\u2019t intend on it happing but it still could? There\u2019s two parts of a lesson, actions (which you\u2019re doing) but talking to. He needs to understand mentally why that\u2019s not okay. Kids can understand a lot more than adults give them credit for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's more appropriate.", "A month might be too much but on the other hand he doesn\u2019t want to apologize? Why? Does he lack of empathy? Anyway I\u2019d give two weeks. And hopefully he\u2019ll understand. Thanks for teaching him this.", "Soft YTA - I appalaud the originality of the punishment. Though a month is a long time. But I doubt he'll learn anything about this (except to make him feel humiliated, and you don't want him to think that disabled people always feel humiliated for wearing a bib, most of them really don't).   \nIt'd be better if you could take him with you to a volunteer job that works with disabled children and let him get to know them personally. Though I get with his age it might be tricky to do that.", "Nta! Totally harmless punishment. Embarrassing for you too I imagine, for him to treat others that way! Sometimes kids get into the school routine of making fun of others they forget it's unacceptable. In addition I'd teach him how to respond when others are making fun of people and that he shouldn't join in and show that praising others feels better for all.", "NTA. The one thing I think would crush me is finding out any of my kids were being cruel or bullying. The fact that he won't apologise and doesn't seem to see the error of his ways shows why it's a month and not shorter.\n\nA suggestion, if you or another adult have time (I know, I know, what's that when you've got kids??), Maybe see if you/other guardian could take him to volunteer for a couple of hours at a homeless shelter, elderly home or respite centre. \n\nI've done this with mine a few times over the years, and it's been a big eye opener. Also taking them to visit different places of worship, community centres outside their social class etc. Anything that helps them see the world is made up of all sorts of wonderful people, that may be living life very differently.\n\nYou're making him wear a bib, not beating him, shouting or psychologically torturing him. \n\nEither way, parenting is so bloody difficult and everyone has different ideas of how it should be done. So I am sending you internet hugs from one parent to another x", "YTA \u2014 I get your sentiment. But I don\u2019t think this punishment will be effective.", "NTA But do end the punishment early if/when he learns empathy and apologizes sincerely to the other kid.", "Wow, yes, YTA. The only thing your son is going to learn from that is that bullying is okay if you have enough power to get away with it. Humiliating your son won't make him a better person.", "YTA. Awful", "\"This isn't a thing that you should comment on or tease people about, so I'm going to make you experience it for an extended length of time as a punishment.\" \n\nI'm not going to call you an asshole, but I don't think you're handling this well. This is like making your son wear makeup to school because he teased a girl about her makeup--using something that should be seen as normal as a punishment. It's an incredibly misguided punishment.", "YTA. Your child has a significant lack of compassion and lack of understanding of others. Humiliating him isn't going to help that situation.", "NTA", "Nta. Bullies are bad", "His friends already stopped hanging with him before we started to make him wear it.\n\nI am cutting the month down to 2 weeks, and that's after he apologizes.", "I did discuss everything with him and he just doesn't care, he even laughed a few times.\n\nI took away his switch and it did nothing, he is just refusing to apologize\n\nA teacher told me that his friends didn't think it was cool if him to make fun of the kid so now they don't want to be his friends\n\nThe bib seems to be the only punishment that's really working right now", "Yeah you're probably right, he just really hurt the kids feelings and I wanted to make sure he knows how it feels", "I called The school to make sure a teacher sits by him to assure he wears a bib\n\nI'm not happy with what he did and I did not raise him this way", "A good compromise! Hopefully he'll learn his lesson.", "Then I will say I think he\u2019s displaying some very concerning behavior. The complete lack of remorse and refusal to \u201cbend\u201d even when possibly losing friends (when friends are usually everything to a kid) is concerning. I think you should explore or something is going on with him mentally or emotionally. Don\u2019t brush off the early signs, I absolutely don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal or typical for a child to behave that way. Yes kids can be little d*cks, I remember middle school very well. But it\u2019s usually cause by pressure or want of approval from friends. So the fact that his friends didn\u2019t seem to influence him to do it or not do it says he did it for another reason. You need to figure out that reason. Cause if the reason is I just wanted to, I like being mean to people (especially vulnerable people) then his behavior will only escalate the older he gets. And I think you should get your husband on board and explain why you guys can\u2019t just let it go. Lessons don\u2019t stop after a certain time period, they stop once they\u2019ve been learned. But I will say if it\u2019s not working then you need to figure something else out.", "Why not record it and post it online to really humiliate him?", "You certainly have the right idea.", "[deleted]", "Wow you\u2019re making him do that at school he will forever be bullied ! He won\u2019t have any friends or any social life lol. Kids going to hate his life so much. I doubt you\u2019ll ever have a decent relationship with him ever again but I\u2019m sure he will be sorry.", "if he does smt to himself later go ahead and blame yourself please", "YTA for this comment. So you\u2019re going to humiliate him at his school!? That\u2019s some f\u2019ed up parenting. I agree on making him apologize but doing this you\u2019re going to make him the target of bullies as well. Having a teacher sit next to you and having to wear a bib is going to make him a target for years. That\u2019s some great ass parenting OP! /s YTA", "He made fun of the kid 2 weeks ago, we spent a week trying to make him apologize which he would not do, we took away his Nintendo switch, that didn't do anything, so I decided to make him wear a bib", "This. We're on the level of needing him to see a therapist about this if he's losing friends and being punished and he just does not care. Something is wrong here and you need to figure it out, asap.", "why so he can off himself or completely hate his parents forever?", "Humiliating your child is a good punishment?", "Yeah, I'm not going to tell him about the extra time of wearing it until he apologizes, I'll tell him he'll have to wear it for one more week so he learns not to make fun of the kid again", "Maybe get him some therapy/counselling too? \n\nThis is not normal behaviour and while a punishment is needed sometimes that just isn't enough to make sure behaviours change.", "Its truly sad he won\u2019t apologize. That\u2019s the worst part of this.", "You're a kickass parent!", "What if he takes the bib off? Are you going to force it back on? You sound like a shitty parent tbh", "He's wearing the bib until I see him apologize", "I honestly don't understand what you're attempting to achieve here. Your son clearly doesn't give a shit about your opinion or anyone else's. And even if he does apologize, it's only to get out of the \"punishment.\" Not because he's actually sorry about what he said.\n\n\nIf anything, you're teaching him that you cannot be trusted to be aware of his thoughts/feelings. So instead he'd find like-minded people elsewhere. Plus now he knows there will be adults that'll follow through on strange requests. His poor future children (if he has any).\n\n\nI am not even going to rate this as I don't believe any punishments would solve the grand issue with your child. He sounds disturbed, and you should be thinking about setting up an appointment with a psychiatrist. Which is something other users have already mentioned. Consider it, OP.", "i think you should be commended for caring about his behavior towards the disabled child.", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nThose who don't hear must feel. He'll be aiight.", "YTA. Shaming him is not the way to deal with this. You're behavior is no better than his", "A bit of an asshole. Once he apologizes the punishment should stop. Whst you would be teaching him is, never mind if I obey, mom will still rub my nose in it just because she can. Let it be over when he apologized,", "NTA, but shorten it to one dinner and then show him movies about people with disabilities and maybe have him talk to the guidance counselor or a therapist", "NTA - He brought it on himself and an excellent idea to shove in his skull that teasing someone over a bib is unacceptable.", "YTA.   Why do people today think humiliating their child is an appropriate punishment.  You would do better to get kids books that explain different disabilities so your child has a better understanding of what the other child will face in life.  Certainly this will not teach him anything about others disabilities.  You might want to check your parenting skills.", "YTA- I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your son grows to resent the child even more and be even more cruel to him as a result of this. That\u2019s often what ends up happening when you try to flip embarrassment back onto somebody, it\u2019s not very productive.", "YTA i understand what you\u2019re trying to do but i don\u2019t think it will have the desired effect. maybe you can find some age appropriate books, movies, or tv shows that talk about bullying and/or disabled folks\u2019 stories to help teach better behavior and empathy. punishment wise probably no video games for a week or something like that would be appropriate. and he could write an apology letter.", "GOOD DISCIPLINE IDEA!! You are trying to teach him an important lesson, one he has chosen to be stubborn about. I support your decision.", "NTA and I would take him to ALL THE RESTAURANTS, ALL OF THEM, and make him wear a bib and if anyone asked why I would tell them.", "YTA. A month is too much man, it\u2019s still a kid. A week is more appropriate.", "YTA Right now your kid is stubborn. However, he will soon learn that all he has to do is apologize. He doesn't have to mean it. You're teaching him that whatever wrong thing he does, he just has to say the magic words, \"I'm sorry.\" Without any true remorse. \n\nYou have explained to him what he did was wrong. You have told him that he should apologize. His friends and teachers have told him. You can try to shame him into an apology... You can't force him to mean it.", "YTA and it sounds like you rubbed right off on your kid.", "My mom parented like this, and it was honestly not helpful at all. It taught me to just do a better job hiding things from her. I am disabled with disabled children, so I appreciate you wanting to teach him it\u2019s not okay, but punishing him is not going to do that.\n\nI have seen amazing restoration between my oldest and kids who did some pretty hurtful bullying to him. But it came from compassionately him them recognize the hurt they caused, not punishing them.\n\nEvery time he wears the bib you\u2019re engaging in a power struggle with no real winners, and building resentment instead of trust. And that power struggle will just keep getting bigger in future situations.\n\nYou\u2019re also teaching him that there IS something wrong with wearing a bib, instead of normalizing it and the reason it\u2019s needed. \n\nHas he seen behavior like that (mocking someone) modeled? I would evaluate that first. It\u2019s something kids are taught.\n\nI would also work on building trust in the relationship so you can ask questions he feels safe answering, like \u201cdid you think before you made fun of him?\u201d Or \u201chave you ever had somebody make fun of you? How did that feel?\u201d\n\nKids do well when they can. There is a reason he didn\u2019t do well in that moment.

He'll learn how it feels to be forced to wear one by his mom", "Probably true.  But 3 of us were raised by  parents who were worse than assholes, but are not asshole parents/grandparents.
