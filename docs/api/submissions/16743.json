If they don't get it, then you should put one up. It's all fun and games until someone is hurt on  your property and then suddenly it is your fault.", "That's not over reacting. That's a lot of bother from bad parents and bratty kids. Especially the ones sitting on your patio furniture or asking to use your bathroom. Yeah, you can't always control little kids (though that's another good reason to have the fence) but parents enabling it and then getting mad at you potentially endangers you personally or legally.\n\nNTA. Get the HOA to build the fence.", "NTA - you're entitled to your privacy.  Get the fence.", "NTA\n\nFencing is not an over-reaction. \n\nPeople suck", "NTA. The area I live in has a lot of public parks that abut private property and, surprise, in every case I can think of there is a fence that delineates that border. \n\nIt doesn't have to be a giant, solid privacy fence that eliminates the benefits of the park view. It just needs to be a barrier against casual intrusion, to clearly indicate that one side is a public space, but the other is not.\n\nGood luck with the neighbors and the HOA.", "NTA\n\nIf people are sledding on the hill and the hill is HOA property, the HOA better put up a fence. Injuries on that hill will be under their liability insurance.", "NTA but just a thought- any chance that the owners of the park will fence it? All of the local county and city parks here are fenced where they abut private property.", "YWNTBA, good fences make good neighbors. Setting aside how *unbelievably* rude it is for strangers to allow kids to play in your yard, knock on your windows, and ask to use your bathroom in your house just the homeowners insurance issue of children roughhousing on your property is more than reason enough to want a fence.\n\nAnd as a tip, that's probably a good angle to take if you want to avoid sounding grumpy.", "NTA Would a fence be overwhelming? For crying out loud no!!! You have people using your furniture and asking if they can use your bathroom. Get that fence. Put a sign if necessary saying PRIVATE PROPERTY police will be called on trespassers.", "NTA they're using your furniture like it's part of the park", "NTA\n\nYou'd think the HOA might want a fence to stop kids injuring themselves on the steep hill, and suing them.", "NTA\n\nBy the sound of things you are being treated as a park amenity already. It will only get worse.\n\nA fence is a polite boundary. Pepper spray and a BB gun would not be :D", "God no, NTA.  They are violating your privacy and your space.  Demand  it.\n\nGet a water sprinkler and point it down the property line.  One you can start remotely.   Or better yet, one that is motion activated.", "I clicked reading to think you were being over sensitive but I was wrong \ud83d\ude02 NTA. If the tree boundary isn't stopping them, a fence would be a great idea. As a parent, I actually love playgrounds with fence barriers because it gives my kids a stopping point or boundary, so even if it's just that one side I don't think you're being grumpy or ridiculous at all. They're blurring the space between public and private property in a way that's intrusive.", "NTA. Until you get the fence, I would get a big signs that say NOPE. \n\nGet cameras & speakers, so when entitled assholes come by you can play that song by Morris Day, \"You ain't gotta go home, but you gotta get the hell outta here.\"", "Please get a fence. Your building is not acting correctly by not getting one. People sledded into the building. They're going to get sued. I understand they have to vote it for community expense purposes but they really need to that. NTA.", "NAH.\n\nI don't think there is any conflict.  \n\nDepending on the cost / availability of funds - you may certainly have neighbors being against it.  And they have every right to feel that way.  But you aren't in anyway an asshole for proposing it.", "NTA but could be.   The fence should be a discussion amongst the whole HOA community.  As in they will all be involved in the price and children in the condo complex could lose easy access to the park.   But bringing it up at the meeting or in group chat is perfectly normal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You aren't grumpy for wanting people to stay away from your home. These mindless idiots what seem to think its ok to hang around your place because they were at the park next door are beyond annoying. The fence is a great idea.", "NTA. A fence is a clear way to distinguish the property line between your building and the public park. The people going to the park have problems respecting your basic boundaries and there are other safety concerns; you\u2019d be doing everyone a favor.", "NTA, the HOA needs to put a fence. It's totally reasonable to be irritated about random strangers using your furniture, sledding into your house, and honestly I'm shocked that someone would demand to use your bathroom. Who the hell does that?!", "NTA point outto HOA they maybe liable if a trespasser gets hurt sledding etc on hill", "NTA", "NTA. From the title I thought this might just be you not wanting to see the park. But this is 100% a reason to have a fence. If only to make it clear where your property begins and the park ends.", "NTA for having a fence put up. You will probably need to go door to door to get support.\n\nHowever based on my living with an HOA, you might have to pay for your own fence. Presumably this will give you back some modicum of privacy especially if it is a privacy fence.", "That was my thought when the kid hurt their arm rolling down the hill. Luckily I think they just bent it a little wrong, but what if the broke it? Technically it\u2019s common space for the condo building, but I don\u2019t want to be responsible for any type of payment.", "Moms were sitting at a picnic table on the other side of the park while there 7 year olds were ding dong ditching and messing with my place 200 feet away. I like to think my fellow condo owners and I are good people, but what if we weren\u2019t? I wouldn\u2019t trust someone I didn\u2019t know.", "When I was considering buying the place, I never once thought I\u2019d have someone ask to use my bathroom lol.", "yeah! like a 2 foot fence would absolutely address this", "Good question, my city seems to be pretty reasonable, guess I never thought about contacting them", "Luckily our HOA is one of the few that\u2019s well managed and they budget very well. They just did $100k worth of concrete work and didn\u2019t have to raise the monthly fee, which is still cheap at $160. The neighbor that lives on the bottom level with me (8 units to building, 4 on each side with 2 bottom and 2 top) has ran into a couple of the above issues before and supports the fence. But they don\u2019t work from home, so haven\u2019t been as disrupted in their daily lives.", "My entire community has green space all over that\u2019s connected by sidewalk / bike paths. The fence would only be about 75 feet, to act as a clearly defined barrier( would think the trees would be enough). The side walk is also right next to my place, road runs parallel to the park and my condo building. Access for complex wouldn\u2019t be limited at all.", "The grandma was actually probably the least annoyed when I said no, hopefully she realized how weird of a request that was.", "NTA. I am on a HOA board. Since it is common space attend the next board meeting and address the potential liability that the entire complex will have if someone gets hurt. Document everything you can before you go (dates and times would help).", "This is a point to bring up in your email for sure. You have a liability if things are occurring on your or other condo properties.", "That\u2019s the weirdest part to me lol. Who knocks on a strangers door and asks to use their bathroom? Like other than serial killers. Why would anyone want their home to become the backup bathroom for a nearby playground? If I was able to get past the shock and think clearly I\u2019d tell them $50 for Number 1, $100 for Number 2, plus a $100 deposit for flushing and cleanliness.", "Tell them that it is 1337$ per visit to the bathroom with a minimum of 65536 pre-paid.", "Might be worth a few calls if it will save your HOA some cash, might be worth talking to other property owners who don't have fencing as well. They might be having the same problems you are.", "I'd contact everyone until someone said yes.", "After the initial incident, I thought maybe they knew my aunt or her husband, he lived here for 12 years. They had no idea who she was. Was probably 70+ years old, so could of been something else going on. I\u2019d say I was polite to her when I told her no. Definitely had an annoyed tone with the other interactions. Angry when they were messing with my cat for sure."]}
