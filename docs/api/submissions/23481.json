Regardless of how I put it, my opinion on the situation would remain the same: most people, myself included, don't truly care about how often someone has sex with whomever they want. However, the reality is that one may still face ridicule or shame for certain things. If she wanted me to validate her lifestyle and decisions uncritically, she approached the wrong person.

I\u2019m obviously being blunt by saying \u201cjust stop\u201d but the answer is not comforting these behaviors.

IMO while It's true that individuals should have the agency to make choices about their OWN bodies and content, it's important to consider the broader implications of platforms like OF. The concern isn't about women *feeling good about their bodies or enjoying their beauty* but rather the SYSTEMATIC OBJECTIFICATION of the female body for profit. This can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to the devaluation of women as MERE OBJECTS OF DESIRE. Companies like OF and Playboy both can contribute to the normalization of objectifying women's bodies. Both contexts can reinforce harmful societal norms that place emphasis on women's physical appearance rather than their intellect, skills, or contributions to society.\n\nAND Addressing concerns about the commodification of women's bodies doesn't aim to *control women's sexuality* but to FOSTER A MORE EQUITABLE AND RESPECTFUL SOCIETY that values women BEYOND their physical attributes."]}
