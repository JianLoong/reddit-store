Need I mention before I suggested we both should sleep, I let her vent her heart out for about two hours. I don't see what she was \"calling me out on later\" in the morning. The judgement-free-zone I provided her to vent at 5 am? WHILE I SHOULD'VE WORDED IT DIFFERENTLY, I can't think of anything else I could've added to the whole conversation of her being complaining and insecure about her actions.

I'd like to mention I didn't shut her up so I could sleep, I let her go about her woes for about two hours before I finally decided it was best for us both to sleep.

Should be easy enough to just stop.", "Venting is not trauma dumping.", "THIS lol. In response to her venting, I reacted by being silent, which was the most comforting approach to avoid letting my personal beliefs interfere and making the situation worse. Engaging in an unproductive argument (had she kept bringing up the annoying meaningless points she did the next day) at 5 am would have hurt more than my words did the next day. Regardless of how I put it, my opinion on the situation would remain the same: most people, myself included, don't truly care about how often someone has sex with whomever they want. However, the reality is that one may still face ridicule or shame for certain things. If she wanted me to validate her lifestyle and decisions uncritically, she approached the wrong person. Her evident distress and insecurity about the situation indicate that she may not fully embrace her actions.", "TWO HOURS?!? She\u2019s insane.

Because people have this backwards view of how a woman should behave. And that includes only having sex with 1 guy (preferably a boyfriend/husband) with no casual hookups in between. And people have the worst views of sex workers- but not the people who pay for the sex. And OF is the best type of sex work cuz you get to choose EVERYTHING you do or don\u2019t do.

Being awake at odd (for her) hours, seeking you out (when you're not friends) to rant about how everyone is against her, then deciding that *you're* against her too based on your normal response to that bizarre behavior \u2014 these aren't just signs of distress, they could be signs of some kind of mental health episode.\n\nPlease consider this possibility before you talk to her. Sending what you think is a straightforward message of \"don't come to me for validation\" may not play out the way you hope.", "Just remember that you could be affected by her choices; indiscriminate sex is her business but constantly bringing in random hookups while you're not home could end badly.  For both of you.", "I feel bad for people who view your self worth as part of your sexual promiscuity.", "Why?", "For you, it seems.\n\nI want to compare this to overweight people just eating less\u2014it's similar in that both involve core urges built in for survival\u2014but in this case, she doesn't even want to stop, and there's also no reason she should.\n\nIf it's easy for you to just not do things that cause problems in your life, that's great for you, but you don't know what it's like to be someone else.

A few years ago, you could have told me it was easy not to go to a casino four times a week, and that would just have meant that you had no idea what it was like to be me.\n\nIf you don't like road rage, you could say it's easy to stop driving. But I'm pretty sure you wouldn't suggest that because you don't have a personal judgment against driving.", "I think all of your decisions affect your values and how quality of a person you are. Wouldn\u2019t you agree someone\u2019s decisions affect your view of them?? Why is promiscuity like a separate thing different from other actions??

Why are these any different?", "Supply and demand. Pretty easy. Humans aren\u2019t objects but supply and demand still applies. If everyone wants you and you only give yourself and your time to a select few that\u2019s a very high quality person there.

Or if I think she drives too much?\n\nHere\u2014I'll bold the relevant part of the topic sentence and italicize the relevant parts of the paragraph, and you'll see that the body of the paragraph exists only to elaborate on the topic sentence, rather than to make an entirely new point that she's an addict:\n\n>If it's easy for you to just not do things that cause problems in your life, that's great for you, but **you don't know what it's like to be someone else**. *You have no idea how easy or hard that would be for them.

Still think this way. That\u2019s the way I view it, you don\u2019t need to share that view.", "No i actually asked that question because in both cases my answer is the same: you don\u2019t comfort bad behavior\u2026. \n\nThis is for all these situations, the answer is not comforting them. I\u2019m obviously being blunt by saying \u201cjust stop\u201d but the answer is not comforting these behaviors. If a morbidly obese person keeps eating horribly and cries that they\u2019re fat, you don\u2019t comfort them and tell them to keep eating however they want. If someone road rages and cries that people aren\u2019t comfortable in their car you don\u2019t comfort them and tell them to keep screaming at strangers in their car. If someone is an alcoholic and cries that alcohol is ruining their life you don\u2019t comfort them and tell them to keep drinking however they want.\n\nSame thing applies here whether she\u2019s addicted or not. She\u2019s upset and crying about her lifestyle that she can change, the correct response is not comforting her and saying \u201cyes, you should sleep with whomever whenever and keep doing OF\u201d", "So mature", ">you don\u2019t comfort bad behavior\u2026.\n\nIt seems that we disagree on the fundamental idea that OP's roommate sleeping around is bad behavior (in case you weren't sure, the purpose of the road rage analogy was to suggest that I was picking up some judgment from you about the roommate's sex habits).\n\nYour point that it's easy to change the behavior seems to include the concept that she probably should, and I don't agree with that."]}
