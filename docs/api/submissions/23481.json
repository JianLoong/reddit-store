The judgement-free-zone I provided her to vent at 5 am? WHILE I SHOULD'VE WORDED IT DIFFERENTLY, I can't think of anything else I could've added to the whole conversation of her being complaining and insecure about her actions.

In response to her venting, I reacted by being silent, which was the most comforting approach to avoid letting my personal beliefs interfere and making the situation worse. Engaging in an unproductive argument (had she kept bringing up the annoying meaningless points she did the next day) at 5 am would have hurt more than my words did the next day. Regardless of how I put it, my opinion on the situation would remain the same: most people, myself included, don't truly care about how often someone has sex with whomever they want. However, the reality is that one may still face ridicule or shame for certain things. If she wanted me to validate her lifestyle and decisions uncritically, she approached the wrong person.

I\u2019m obviously being blunt by saying \u201cjust stop\u201d but the answer is not comforting these behaviors.

And showing up at unsociable hours begging someone else for emotional validation sounds pretty insecure.", "NTA only a close friend or family member would be allowed to wake me up to rant about such bullshit, let alone some roommate ive had for a few months.", "NTA. If she\u2019s that easy, then she needs to own it, and not blame you for not listening to her or comforting her.", "Your roommate needs to be like Samantha from Sex and the City and own it. NTA you were trying to sleep and she came in to rant at you, then got upset you were tired and not responding. She pushed you to this point I think. Maybe you were wrong saying what she said but the rudeness of her behaviour is so much worse.", "NTA. She wanted you to communicate with her and you did.  If she wants to live her life as she has been, she needs to understand that people are going to judge.  If she doesn't like the judgement, stop the behavior people are judging her for. \n\nIf she were truly secure in her choices, she wouldn't be upset with this.", "NTA but both y\u2019all sound young. As a fellow night shift worker you lasted a longer in that convo than I could have", "NTA", "NTA. I hate conflict but I still probably would have headed her off at the pass by just explaining that I need to sleep when she knocked on the door at 5.30am. That is not a normal time to have roommate confidences, you did not have to stay and listen to her. You are completely within your rights to not entertain that kind of nonsense, especially as it leads to two tired people falling out.", "NTA people are allowed to do what they want with their lives but they can't control what other people think and say about them. She's earned her reputation sounds like", "NTA tell her actions have consequences", "NTA - She's insecure because people are, justifiably, perceiving her for how she acts. She either needs to tough up and deal with the random folks, or change her behavior. \n\nShe had ZERO right to start insulting you.", "NTA If she's unhappy with her choices that's up to her.", "NTA - no lies were detected in what you said\n\nIf you're going to make a decision, have the guts to stand behind it and stand tall. If you're going to be embarrassed about enjoying yourself, then don't. \n\nSociety's opinions matter as much as used toilet paper.", "NTA\n\nShe put her problems before your health.\n\nSounds like she starting to find all the sex a bit hollow and unfullfilling.\n\nYou could apologise by saying \"I'm sorry I snapped at you but I was tired and needed to sleep. If you would like we can talk now.\"\n\nIf she still has a problem then she is the AH.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t get to monopolize your time and you only gave her what she dished out", "NTA, I would argue that your actions are what define who you are, and he decisions and actions are making her unhappy. Instead of venting she needs to make different decisions and actions.", "If she\u2019s sleeping around a ton, and on OF, of course she\u2019s giving everyone the idea she\u2019s easy as hell. She can\u2019t behave that way and be surprised when folks say all that. \n\nYou\u2019re not responsible to comfort her just because she\u2019s facing the consequences of her own choices. It\u2019s better for the truth to be said anyway if she\u2019s gonna act like an AH to you. \n\nHer insulting you and throwing a tantrum tells me she just doesn\u2019t want to face the truth of how she\u2019s behaved. If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it\u2019s a bloody mf duck.", "NTA, she shouldn't have been insulting you in the morning and she should've let you sleep the night before. You don't owe her your time to rest.\n\nTo me it sounds like she's tired of being shamed and any perceived slight is making her lash out. Not good behavior and she definitely still needs to apologize for what happened with you two, but based on the replies to this post from people who don't even know her, the shaming has been relentless and she's probably just sick of it and trying anything to protect herself.\n\nAnyway-\n\nEveryone in the replies is being a butthead. There are valid concerns about OF modeling being sold as \"empowering,\" which OP raised and I agree with, but almost every other person is engaging in some wild misogyny.\n\nSure, actions have consequences, but she as a woman is allowed to be frustrated that the \"consequences\" of her sex life are that everyone has determined she is worthless. She is allowed to want that to change, because even if she made the decisions she made, it was everyone else who started ascribing her morality to them-- that SUCKS and frankly, it isn't her fault for feeling upset by it. You all are so comfortable passing these horrible judgments to someone online who didn't ask for them, who isn't even aware she's being judged. Imagine how it feels to receive that same shaming from people you see frequently.", "esh of course she shouldnt have vented at you in the middle of the night and then hounded you about it in the morning, but you also shouldnt have called her a slut; that was unkind.\n\ni saw some people in here saying that you should find another roommate and i think thats ridiculous.  it sounds as if you dont have any actual problems outside of this little spat.  i suggest you apologize to her for the name-calling but make it clear that she cant just dump her insecurities on you in the middle of the night like that.", "In an idealistic world no one would give af about how many people women sleep with.  Unfortunately this is not that world and slut shaming is alive and well and if she\u2019s going to put herself out like that she needs thicker skin", "NTA. Actions have consequences. You want to get treated like a lady act like one. She acts like a woman of ill repute, so she gets treated like one.  That's not your problem. Tell her to seek therapy.", "You are her roommate, not her therapist.", "NTA. She is and is upset people noticed apparently.", "[removed]", "Idk about pity but I don't see how OF is supposed to be \"empowering\" for us women. Certainly, it is undeniable that OF surpasses traditional forms of sex work in one aspect: the platform is designed to empower content creators. However, a significant concern arises when women create content on OF, as the monetization of their activity is fundamentally based on the COMMODIFICATION OF THE FEMALE BODY, treating it as a product or service to be sold.", "Funny how I said as much with different phrasing and got downvoted to oblivion lol. You are right.", "Why has this been downvoted lmao. Had I come across a post like this myself, I'd have said something along the lines of what you've said fs.", "You do realize it\u2019s totally possible that she\u2019s fine with her decisions, just not ok with assholes being cruel to her about them, right?", "Exactly.  At the moment my body is invalueable.\nWhen i make an OF i commodify my body for the worth i charge monthly($5,99 h\u00e8h\u00e8 25% discount this month).

Maybe the double standard exists to some degree but not everyone feels that way. There's really nothing to respect about being promiscuous in my opinion.\n\nPeople can live their lives how they choose but they don't get to decide how other people view them.

People shouldn\u2019t be judged if they choose to sleep around or post nudes.  Cops shouldn\u2019t be judged because they don\u2019t always follow the law.  Criminals shouldn\u2019t be judged because they steal or kill.  Politicians shouldn\u2019t be judged on their bills or what they vote in favor of.

We should make judgement based only on one\u2019s intentions.   /s", "Ussually yes, but some discretion from the person talking can also be expected. For example, if someone knocks on the bedroom door of someone they live with but hardly know and find the person in a very sleepy condition, and the sleepy person does not give any indication that venting is oke, then venting would not be oke. The roommate noticed the roommate getting quiet and even had the audecity to become agry about it instead of thinking it might be the result of her crossing of bounderies.\n\nYou should be save to lower your social bariers when you are home alone in your room.

This does not make you an AH", "I didn't mind listening to her perspective, and I patiently heard her out for about TWO hours. Eventually, I thought it would be better for both of us to get some rest. Personally, I found silence to be the most comforting approach to handle her outburst. My choice of words the next day after snapping at her could have been better, but I don't think staying silent while she vented was wrong or rude in any way.", "I would have reacted by saying, hey listen I am way too tired to be present in this conversation, I need to sleep", "Those are all just your words, no one here is saying the opposite. I just said choices have consequenses. That applies to woman and men equally. If woman know that a man is a player they are probably hestitant to start anything serious with him.. same as most men have with OF models. Thats called choices having consequenses. Had nothing to do with sex or gender. Your rant missen the point completely.", "Before your quick edit, I see you said \"Sluts shouldn't be judged if they choose to sleep around or post nudes.\"\n\nI also think it's fair to note that you're equating highly sexually active women with crooked cops, criminals, and politicians, so you really do have a problem with highly sexually active women.\n\nWe're not going to see eye-to-eye, here.", "I've taken it into account, but I'm experiencing a sense of helplessness as there seems to be limited actions I can take. Attempting to make her aware of her situation and its reasons might have unfavorable consequences.

And yeah I have NO idea how easy or hard it is for her, seriously, no idea. THIS is exactly why I decided to **stay quiet** throughout her rant. Why did I let her in? Seemed like a decent thing to do considering she was seriously distraught and awake at odd hours. I acknowledge how I said what I said was demeaning and I could've worded it MUCH differently, but she called me an asshole WAY before that for staying silent and not comforting her with my approval.", "Sorry, I was debating with Clayton2024\u2014I completely believed that you were neutral about her lifestyle.
