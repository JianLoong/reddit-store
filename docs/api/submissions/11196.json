I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun.\n\nAfter ten minutes my friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same.\n\nHe asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn\u2019t know this was the wedding.\n\nI trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me.\n\nI assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn\u2019t bother her after that and the party soon ended.\n\nI got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did.\n\nThat only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine.\n\nShe didn\u2019t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it\u2019s my fault that the two are now fighting over this.\n\nI\u2019ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything.\n\nSo, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding?\n\nEdit: I am a guy. I cosplayed the character Emily from The Corpse Bride and had blue paint all over. I\u2019m also Australian and I\u2019ve never heard a costume party meaning fancy.

And tells you, the only person in a wedding dress, that you're fine and don't need to go home and change.\n\nYour friend and her husband are ridiculous, and if he's already starting off their marriage by making decisions for them without telling her (AKA letting you remain in the costume), they won't last long.", "'Oh, hey, we're so alternative and cool, and we don't go in for all that trad wedding nonsen- ARE YOU WEARING A BRIDE COSTUME TO MY FANCY DRESS PARTY/UNANNOUNCED WEDDING?!

Two people blaming you for something that was their fault on multiple levels.", "Definitely NTA.

You don't want those people in your life.", "NTA not only were you in costume, you had no way of knowing? And when you DID you were assured it was fine.

Lousy friends.", "NTA... but I will say you made a faux pas by going to a pre wedding event in a wedding dress. Even with it being The Corpse Bride I would have steered clear of that costume choice. But you're 19, so I can fully understand why you saw it as a great idea.", "1) You weren't told this was a wedding. You were invited to an engagement party - they have different etiquette.\n\n2) You were told it was a costume party and were invited with very short notice.  \n\n3) you picked a costume that you already had due to the short notice that the attendees would appreciate, and people did like it.  \n\n4) You cleared it with the groom, regardless of the fact that he's trying to backpedal now.\n\nSo no, NTA.  I'm going to assume that your cosplay probably required heavy makeup if not prosthetics and probably both.  It's not just a slip over your head and be done.  Changing out of it is not as easy as all that.  You spoke to the groom and he cleared it, and is now throwing you under the bus because she's mad.  She's throwing a tantrum because you broke an unwritten rule of a type of party that you didn't know you were attending.  Your friend is being absolutely unreasonable, and her husband is an ass.", "The whole idea is stupid", "They where well aware that I cosplay, that\u2019s why I asked if there was a theme to it", "NTA. If I was hosting a wedding costume party and a dude showed up as corpse bride I would legit think it was the funniest ever. It doesn\u2019t say much for their marriage if he blamed you for being honest", "Lots of people clearly didn't read all of it.", "NTA. If a person's going to do a surprise wedding with a costume theme, they have to be willing to accept a certain level of uncertainty in how it plays out.", "Nta you were invited to a costume party. You came in a costume.", "ESH ok this judgment was hard because I can see everyone's point of view. This is really a weird set up. I've heard of the surprise weddings too. Some celebrities have done them. So I get what they were going for. The costume wedding part was a little weird, but to each his own. Yes, even though it was a costume party and you didn't know it was a wedding, you did know it was a wedding themed party to celebrate that they were getting married. You don't wear a wedding dress to someone else's wedding themed party, even if it's a corpse bride. So you were a little bit of an AH for that. However, you balanced it off by offering to run home and change when you found out it was actually a wedding. \n\nI think the bride went a bit over the top about it. Like you said, you didn't know it was a wedding. I don't see how your costume could ruin her wedding. And her husband did say it was fine. So I think they're both blowing it all out of proportion, especielly the way they attacked you after, then blocked you on everything.\n\n Personally if I was the bride in this situation, I would have just shrugged it off and had a good time anyways. A wedding is about having the people you love there to celebrate with you. I don't generally sweat the petty stuff.", "NTA\nThey should have been straightforward with you but they weren't then turn on you for not knowing something in which they didn't tell you. \nbe glad that your friendship with them is over don't even try to interact with them ever again even if  they try in the future.", "At first I was like \"Where did he get all of his audacity??\" And then I was like \"Oh it's a surprise wedding.\" You clearly didn't know it was a wedding and the groom  himself told you it was all good.

This whole thing is so funny. I hope that they can see the humor eventually.", "This is the clearest NTA as anything can be. \"How *dare* you dress as a corpse bride to an event you had no way of knowing was a wedding?!\" Ridiculous.

How do you need to be told that it is obviously not okay.", "ESH. Going to a wedding-related event in a bride outfit, corpse or no, is not cool and you should have known better. However, the groom is also an AH for saying it was ok (when he also should have known better that his wife would be mad) and then not owning his mistake.

This is ridiculous. If it\u2019s not a traditional wedding then traditional wedding rules don\u2019t apply", "NTA\n\nThe husband is the idiot here.

It was a costume for a party that had no theme for 1. 2, this was an ambush wedding, to which you had no knowledge of prior.

First off, she could have totally avoided this situation by giving a theme when you asked - there are enough themes/rules for costumes that would have virtually eliminated any issues.  The ball was in her court to do this, and she dropped it. Secondly, you asked if you should change as soon as you knew it was a wedding and one half of the wedded couple declined.  Finally, and most importantly, it is very hard to see how a guy dressed as a dead bride can actually steal the spotlight from a real life bride. \n\nBride and groom are both AHs and I wish them every happiness that they deserve.", "NTA its always annoying when a person makes bad decisions and then insists on blaming an innocent person for the consequences.

Best to find new friends.", "Info: If \"custom\" was a typo for costume you may want to fix it so people at least realize this was a costume party, as you clarified in a reply you made.", "NTA. Some people are so delusional, they'll blame everyone but themselves when they are COMPLETELY in the wrong. If I was in the bride's place, I would've laughed about it. This just shows her level of entitlement.", "Bro...NTA.\n\nMy MIL told me how my SIL is planning to do this exact thing for her wedding in October this year...she's going to tell everyone it's a Halloween party, but ***SURPRISE*** it's actually her wedding. \n\nI think it is a terrible idea, and your post proves why, exactly. You can't tell people it's a costume party, then get mad when they show up in costume.", "NTA \nYou didn't know, and when you worked it out, you intended to change but were told it wasn't a problem by the groom.", "ESH. Honestly even showing up to an hour engagement party in a corpse \u201cbride\u201d costume is a risky move. You want your friend to be the focus, not you.

Engagement costume parties are not \u201c a thing\u201d so it\u2019s impossible to assume known etiquette.\n\nIf you made any mistake, it is that it was a costume party and not a Halloween party, and an engagement perhaps isn\u2019t the best time for a spooky costume.

Surely they knew that the number of variables could result in confusion or mistakes. Additional, corpse bride is a blue person. Corpse bride seems fine imo for a costume engagement party.

Some parents get really controlling when they\u2019re bankrolling weddings.", "I hate that Reddit is so harsh that you had to add a second comment about how you don't actually force your husband to do things, lol", "If my choices were a free wedding I hated or a smaller wedding I paid for myself where I got what I wanted, I know what I\u2019d choose \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "Considering OP is a guy and painted blue, I don't think wearing white was the uh. Confusing thing.", "Yes!! Pics !", "yuuup. i'm already pouring one out for their marriage, RIP", "Yes, this exactly.

What an wasted opportunity!", "You would think since they are having a surprise costume party for a wedding, they would have the capacity to be able to turn this into a hysterically comedic moment. \n\nI know I would have", "Honestly, They're Australian and as an Australian myself, I am deeply surprised they didn't. That's exactly our sense of humour.", "I was so taken aback by how young the y'all are I didn't give gender a second thought. \n\nI have to know though - what were you going to change into? If you did full makeup for Corpse Bride I don't think you'd have time to scrub it off and do an entirely new look, do you have other dead blue characters ready to go?", "I was thinking about it as he was announcing it was a wedding. I have a sonic onsie. The makeup wouldn\u2019t really match but I could just say I\u2019m the Sonic in the movie trailer before it\u2019s redesign", "If OP is a good cosplayer (and it sounds like he is), those people are wizards. I have zero doubt he could have improvised something from the decor or whatever he had at the hotel.

That\u2019s unacceptable.", "EXACTLY!

NTA. If it were me I might have cried, but from laughing.", "She was pretending to be a cool bride without being a cool person", "The groom 100% threw you under the bus because he told you not to change. Honestly, these people sound exhausting. If they can't handle someone wearing something they don't like to a SURPIRSE wedding with NO DRESSCODE than I really don't see how they can survive actual marital problems", "And with his skin painted blue! It's so obviously a silly costume that it hurts my head thinking about the couple's nonsense.", "They may not get divorced but they sure will be miserable together.", "> Think of how hilarious the photos of real bride with gender swapped corpse bride could have been!\n\nRight?!

Except it was a surprise bridal shower\u2014she thought she was just out taking a walk with a friend and had no idea they were headed to a bridal shower in her honor because it was a surprise party.
