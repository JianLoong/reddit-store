I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun.\n\nAfter ten minutes my friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same.\n\nHe asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn\u2019t know this was the wedding.\n\nI trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me.\n\nI assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn\u2019t bother her after that and the party soon ended.\n\nI got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did.\n\nThat only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine.\n\nShe didn\u2019t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it\u2019s my fault that the two are now fighting over this.\n\nI\u2019ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything.\n\nSo, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding?\n\nEdit: I am a guy. I cosplayed the bride from corpse bride and had blue paint all over me", "created_utc": 1677677065, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f3p2c/aita_for_wearing_a_wedding_dress_at_a_wedding/", "score": 2696, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm going to assume that your cosplay probably required heavy makeup if not prosthetics and probably both.  It's not just a slip over your head and be done.  Changing out of it is not as easy as all that.  You spoke to the groom and he cleared it, and is now throwing you under the bus because she's mad.  She's throwing a tantrum because you broke an unwritten rule of a type of party that you didn't know you were attending.

It doesn\u2019t say much for their marriage if he blamed you for being honest", "Lots of people clearly didn't read all of it.", "NTA.

You came in a costume.", "ESH ok this judgment was hard because I can see everyone's point of view. This is really a weird set up. I've heard of the surprise weddings too. Some celebrities have done them. So I get what they were going for. The costume wedding part was a little weird, but to each his own. Yes, even though it was a costume party and you didn't know it was a wedding, you did know it was a wedding themed party to celebrate that they were getting married. You don't wear a wedding dress to someone else's wedding themed party, even if it's a corpse bride. So you were a little bit of an AH for that. However, you balanced it off by offering to run home and change when you found out it was actually a wedding. \n\nI think the bride went a bit over the top about it. Like you said, you didn't know it was a wedding. I don't see how your costume could ruin her wedding. And her husband did say it was fine. So I think they're both blowing it all out of proportion, especielly the way they attacked you after, then blocked you on everything.\n\n Personally if I was the bride in this situation, I would have just shrugged it off and had a good time anyways. A wedding is about having the people you love there to celebrate with you.

First off, she could have totally avoided this situation by giving a theme when you asked - there are enough themes/rules for costumes that would have virtually eliminated any issues.  The ball was in her court to do this, and she dropped it. Secondly, you asked if you should change as soon as you knew it was a wedding and one half of the wedded couple declined.

Honestly even showing up to an hour engagement party in a corpse \u201cbride\u201d costume is a risky move. You want your friend to be the focus, not you.

Engagement costume parties are not \u201c a thing\u201d so it\u2019s impossible to assume known etiquette.\n\nIf you made any mistake, it is that it was a costume party and not a Halloween party, and an engagement perhaps isn\u2019t the best time for a spooky costume.

You were dressing for a costume party. They didn\u2019t specify a theme, but your costume is funny given the idea of preparing for a wedding! The bride and groom are TA for not communicating with you at all. If one of them had an issue with how this turned out, they could\u2019ve talked to you about changing much sooner. This easily could\u2019ve turned into a funny joke of a memory but they expected you to read their minds, and the fact that the husband is mad at you for telling his wife he was okay with it?

If the bride was going to get angry over what people wore, she shouldn\u2019t have pulled this \u201cgotcha, surprise wedding!\u201d nonsense.", "NTA. I'm sorry your \"friend\"and  her husband expect you to read minds. You asked if there was a theme AND you asked if you should change , both times told no, then they attack you? Doesn't make any sense to me.", "NTA. You wore a costume to a costume party and then even offered to go change and were told not to. They don\u2019t get to be upset that you didn\u2019t dress appropriately for a wedding that you didn\u2019t know you were going to.", "I think it\u2019s an odd costume choice for an engagement party, but I have to go with NTA because you offered to change and the groom said no.", "NTA.  Maybe your friend assumed that if she had an engagement \"costume party,\" people were just going to show up in suits and dresses.  I have no doubt the groom was fine with your costume until the bride said she wasn't.  Then he threw you under the bus so hard he probably won a stuffed animal.  They both seem annoying.  Again, you're  NTA.", "If you're 19m dressed up as a corpse bride I doubt anyone would mistake you for the actual bride. NTA.", "NTA. You had no idea, and offered to change. And honestly, they are going to be divorced within 5 years. So you\u2019re good.", "NTA. These people are far too immature to be married. It's probably better for you that they blocked you. No one needs that kind of drama.", "NTA\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes", "NTA, you didn't know and when you found out you where told it was ok to stay dressed like that", "NTA.

You can\u2019t cry about traditional wedding etiquette when you have a non traditional wedding.", "NTA", "ESH\n\nYou should have known better than to wear a wedding themed costume to an engagement party. Even if it hadn't turned into a surprise wedding, I could easily see the bride wanting to do a similar costume to what you showed up wearing for the party which also would have been awkward. When in doubt, if an event is celebrating someone else's wedding or engagement, steer as far away from wearing bride/groom attire as possible.\n\nThey overreacted and should have been more prepared for their surprise to be imperfect. A wedding is a very substantial event to spring on a group of people so there are a number of ways it could have ended poorly, this just happened to be one of them. They also should have been more forthcoming about their discomfort with your costume from the beginning, rather than saying it was fine and then throwing a tantrum later.", "NTA\n\nYour friend chose to have a surprise wedding and got mad when people weren\u2019t wearing wedding appropriate attire???", "YTA and the husband is as well. He can't be expected to take all of the blame because technically yes, you could've still left and gotten changed once the wedding was announced.

You knew this was an engagement party, and you don't dress as a bride for engagement party (unless you're the bride to be) even if its theme costume party.", "The amount of people that have no reading context and cannot see basic context clues, like OP literally saying he is a guy in the first sentence.\n\nOP SOOO NTA! You came up with a Hilarious costume and if I were the bride, I would have LOVED this!

Though you did ask the Groom which was a good choice too and he said it\u2019s fine.

Part of my reasoning is that I don't understand this apparently well-known tradition of an \"engagement party.\" I know many people who have gotten engaged and have mever heard of an explicit \"engagement party.\" I read this as a costume party to get together to celebrate the engagement, not some formal tradition. You interpreted this as a casual event (because you asked for a theme, and there was none), so at a casual event, it's not inappropriate to wear a funny costume. You then asked one of the people getting married if you should change, and he said no. I would also imagine if you went home and changed, you would have either held up the wedding, or missed it entirely.\n\nThe YTAs here are ridiculous.", "I will go for nta but first I want to see the bride corpse cosplay.", "Reading the title I could not imagine a scenario where you wouldn't be the AH, but I'm pleasantly surprised that there is indeed a scenario where you're NTA. \n\nYou did everything right and even if you hadn't asked the husband you'd still be NTA because how could you have guessed that?

I've never even heard of that. Seems like a terrible idea. \n\nI'd argue that the only asshole here is the groom and soft TA to the bride. The groom should have asked the bride if she wanted you to change before saying you could stay. (Though immediately cussing someone out is over the line. You'd think a few years of friendship would warrant some benefit of the doubt.) \n\nWith the ages given, and how they handled this conflict, I don't think you have to worry about them as a couple for very long though.

And the friend received full blessings to keep it on.\nOP is NTA. It\u2019s one thing if they knew about the surprise. But for whatever reasons the couple thought it would be hilarious to surprise everyone with a wedding they didn\u2019t expect.", "If he was cosplaying as Corpse Bride from the Tim Burton movie, it is a full dress and veil with blueish tint.\n\nEdit to change gender of OP", "Right? I'm dying to see a guy dressed as the Corpse Bride.", "It's going to be a fun marriage.", "How is he possibly TA? He didn\u2019t know it was a wedding. Asked if he should change and was told by the groom that it was fine and got stabbed in the back by the groom when he was being truthful. \n\nThe bride and groom are TA\u2019s.", "Right? The bride and groom didn't warn anyone that a wedding was happening until it was starting! If you want people to be dressed appropriately for an event, let them know said event is happening at least,  jeez", "Because it was a costume party.", "> I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting\n\nCause it was announced as a costume party?", "I agree with your NTA but he was a dude in a dress & blue paint.", "It sounds like an awful trend. Like if I'm going to a wedding I want to know about it. What if you had other plans and were just planning on stopping by. As soon as they announce its a wedding you're kind of obliged to stay.", "According to a comment OP had done the blue body paint so I assume they went all in.", "Bruh how tf was she supposed to know it was literally a surprise and the groom told her not to worry about it. How is she in the wrong at all here?", "Did you miss the part where they were told it was a costume party, NOT a wedding? And that the GROOM said it was fine?", "Did you even read the post?", "You realise OP is male, right?", "But he asked if he should change, and was told that he was fine. You can\u2019t blame him for doing something he was told was ok", "The problem is, they sprung it on them so fast it's likely OP would have missed the ceremony if they'd gone home and changed without alerting the wedding party.", "But it was a costume party and the friend said there was no theme. Why on earth would OP think their costume would be an issue when they can wear whatever they want?\n\nThe wedding couple are morons. One for \u201cpranking\u201d people and two for coming onto OP when the ultimate blame is the husband. He showed have asked his wife first. But he gave the go ahead. Then he tries to pull the BS \u201cyou should have changed anyway\u201d. Fuck that noise. OP was given permission. You can\u2019t change your tune and blame someone else because you\u2019re catching heat.", "It was a costume engagement party. Why would it be inappropriate?", "Anyone who's not the bridezilla would've told OP the costume was fine, just as the husband did.", "If it's just an engagement (costume) party I think it's VERY funny. Obviously a big oops to wear it to the wedding, but how could he have known? And he realized immediately that it was inappropriate for the situation and offered to run home and change, which is very courteous.\n\nEdit: pronoun", "A guy cosplaying as the corpse bride for a costume engagement party is pretty funny ngl. If it was a cocktail/black tie attire event it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate, but it was obviously supposed to be a chill costume party. \n\nAnyway if the groom says \u201cyou\u2019re fine don\u2019t change\u201d OP can\u2019t possibly be TA", "It was a costume party, everyone came wearing costumes/cosplay.", "I live 5 minutes away from them", "This must be a regional thing. I was married in a park by a friend who was ordained off the internet, and the wedding is legal. \n\n what is a \"legal wedding venue\"?", "It was a costume party what was he supposed to do?", "It was literally a costume engagement party for a bunch of teens and young 20 year olds\u2026.? How is his costume inappropriate? NTA OP", "She wore a costume to a costume party. OP is NTA.", "I thought it was funny too. That\u2019s why I did it", "He was a corpse bride. That\u2019s a bit different that dressing up as a bride", "It was a costume tho, are you daft?", "A costume? At a costume party? Well, I never.", "It was a COSTUME party. He was expected to go in costume.", "His dress wasn\u2019t white. It was blue.", "Especially when the corpse bride is a 19 year old guy. Bride needs to get a grip.", "I made a typo. It was a costume party. I accidentally wrote custom", "It was a costume party", "It was literally a costume party. If that\u2019s not the occasion for a costume then truly, what is?", "It was a COSTUME PARTY. Read it fully", "Plus, OP is male...", "A short one at least.", "OP is a 19M.\n\nEven if he didn't have the ribs exposed, a tattered wedding dress on a 19M for something that was considered a costume party... I think he'd be fine. \n\nAnd honestly, I'd find it clever coming as the Corpse Bride to my costume party-engagement party. So many fun jokes could be made with friends!", "OPs a guy which makes this actually more hilarious", "Doesn\u2019t matter.   These people are petty.  You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. You dressed up for the type of party they told you they were having.  You asked multiple times.  Let jerks be jerks.  My suggestion is to let them Be jerks by themselves.  Far away from you.", "OP is male, FYI", "Oh gosh I missed that OP was a dude. Absolutely NTA then. I'd have the same judgement if OP was a lady, but this just makes it extra stupid for the bride to be pissed about \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah I completely missed that lol thanks for pointing it out. Regardless of gender how was this person supposed to know it was the actual wedding? Lmao this is a mess", "I went back and checked like 3 times before i commented. Like \u201cthis is actually a boy, right? This is so dumb\u2026\u201d and i kinda wanna see pictures because i bet he killed it as the corpse bride, and that\u2019s the real issue.", "Same! Especially as a fellow cosplayer, I wanna see how well this dude pulled it off"]}
