We're throwing him his first big birthday party that will have both friends and family. He's so excited for it. My sister and her husband Adam have my niece Evie who is 8. Evie is adopted. This becomes somewhat relevant due to the argument. But when she was 2 Evie was diagnosed with a string of medical conditions and health problems. Some more serious than the rest. She's in and out of hospital and they have been warned her life might not be long, if they cannot manage all the various health problems Evie has. It was a huge blow for my sister and Adam but the whole family.\n\nEvie's health has become a topic that gets brought up at everything. Two family weddings were taken over when my sister brought up how sick Evie was, and alluded to the fact she did not have long left (despite her assuring the family on a number of occasions that things were not that bad). One of those weddings was our brother's wedding. One minute the happy couple are the center of attention and the next people are talking about how sad that he has a terminally ill niece and the focus moves onto them. She even made a big deal of talking about Evie's health during the toast and it sounded almost like she was asking someone to start a crowdfunding thing for them to pay for treatments, without outright asking that. My brother was furious and his wife, Mia, was upset that instead of being a happy day, most people ended up in a very somber mood at the wedding.\n\nThis has also happened at birthday parties, block parties, etc. She brought it up at a couple of baby showers we attended together and I assume some outside of that also.\n\nIt's a lot and every time it feels everyone ends up sad, depressed and uncomfortable. My sister and Adam have been spoken to about it before and they claim they don't do it. Evie doesn't always get what's going on and sometimes she's too poorly to care.\n\nWith my oldest son's party coming up, I felt like this was something I needed to try to prevent. So I asked her if she would not bring up Evie's health at the party. She told me she's not going to pretend everything is okay if people ask and that it's important to make it known so people don't try to push her too much. I told her I do not want the whole party to become about Evie being sick again. She told me that's unfair and I know why. So I told her they shouldn't come to the party if they only want to bring up Evie's health. My sister was furious. She accused me of not caring about Evie being sick because she's adopted, said I would be more understanding if Evie was my bio niece. Even asked me why I cared so little about her. She also told me I was an asshole for trying to gloss over the pain they feel and for excluding them when they live in hell every day.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673199932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106p88u/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_and_her_family/", "score": 2723, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For your sister, talking about her daughter's situation obviously makes it a bit easier for her to deal with it. However, just because it makes her feel better doesn't make her entitled to talk about it in any and every situation. Other people have their own lives with their own hardships as well as happy times, and they should be allowed to fully experience those happy times when they do come.

I guess I don't understand why this can't be resolved with a little bit of cooperation and compromise on both your parts. It might have been better to discuss your concerns first before telling your sister what to do. It also seems that your sister should understand and respect your feelings. I have cancer and I dont tell people about it because it brings the room down. Your sister has to understand this. Also, the non-bio comment reflects her insecurities more than your feelings and maybe when things calm down check in on your sister about this. It was unfair of her to say that though.

NTA - but close to everyone here sucks.  Sister should not be there if you don't want her there.", "NTA. It seems like your sister gets off on the attention she gets from Evie being sick. I\u2019m also concerned for Evie: does she not get to have one day without her own mortality and short life-span being brought up? I understand that everyone is different, and she is only 8, but friends of mine have faced terminal diagnoses before and most of them did not want people constantly reminding them \u201comg you\u2019re gonna die, like, so soon huh?\u201d When my mom was dealing w glioblastoma, she had an in-law similar to your sister: my mom could not go to a single fucking family event w/out this other person standing up and making a huge deal that this was probably my mom\u2019s last X (birthday, Christmas, April Fools, tax day etc. Bitch even made a whole Christmas card about MY MOTHERS diagnosis. And sent it not only to her Christmas list but found my mom\u2019s friends/work/acquaintances. Psychotic)\n\nI do not think it is selfish to live while you are alive. I do not think it is selfish to celebrate YOUR child even though this other child may not have long to live (or maybe she does. My bestie made it to 30 with a condition that should have killed her at infancy and again before she reached puberty. She got a phd, traveled, fell in love. Yes, she did pass away,but she also got to live for 30 years and she loved her life. Her heart stopped while out w friends, she died instantly in a very happy moment. My mom is still alive 17 years post glioblastoma diagnosis, which is hella rare to survive that long. There are literally no guarantees)\n\nIf your sister hijacks your son\u2019s birthday, it is ultimately truly unfair to your son and also to Evie.", "NTA. It would of been a good opportunity to call her out on her inappropriate wedding speech and other antics also.

Your son doesn\u2019t deserve to have all the attention shifted to something so sad on a day that will be bringing him so much joy, but evie doesn\u2019t deserve to be excluded. And being adopted, that shit gets trickier and feels really weird \u2026 doubly so (I\u2019m adopted). \n\nI don\u2019t know what the answer for you is, but my heart hurts for both kids. I would say YTA based solely on this entire conversation is centered around adult feelings rather then the children\u2019s feelings and this is a child\u2019s party. Your sister is clearly also an ass but like: terminal illness in a child is REALLY FUCKING HARD. She shouldn\u2019t be dominating every room she walks into with her woes. That\u2019s not healthy for HER nor is it for her child like at all. She needs therapy to help process what is happening.", "YTA. Actually why don\u2019t you just tell them you don\u2019t care a lick about Evie or their struggles and ask them to only reach out if they have something g positive to share? That\u2019s how you feel right? Do you see now how awful that is? \n\nYou understand your child or your partner could fall ill in a way that would dominate your whole life, right?

You are trying to advocate for your son which is what a parent does.  Your sister is suffering a lot and seeking to get reassurance and sympathy all the time from everyone. I am sorry for her pain and for her little one's illness, but she is running a high risk of chasing everyone away if she can't let a 7 year old be the center of attention at his own birthday party.\n\nI don't know your sister or what her motivations are, but in chronic illness and in disability we sometimes see patients (or their caregivers) chasing secondary gain, where they start to use their health issues as a way to get and hold attention and sympathy in appropriately and it is just a form of self-centeredness.  They can end up being very much alone because eventually people aren't willing to allow them to be continuously the center of the earth.", "I know debilitating illnesses happen more often than I would like to know, especially to children. But reading this, I just couldnt help but think about Gypsy Rose. Your sister is just so... attention seeking over it, its insane.

If it were accomodations needed for the child that would be a different story, but this is literally them just seeking attention.\n\nIf they dont have a therapist, they need one NOW.

I'm likely overreacting, but I'd still watch out for things.", "Does your sister have Munchausen by proxy? That would explaim her behaviour\n\nEdit: I was wrong about the severity of MbP, so no it's probably \"just\" grief.\nMaybe suggest grief counseling to her? Or maybe reaching out to a support group for parents of terminally ill kids?", "Tell your sister that it\u2019s not you who treats Evie like adopted but it\u2019s her who thinks that. Because no mother can try to grab attention of people by talking about their children is sick and going to die soon. It\u2019s something that a mother can\u2019t talk out loudly.

Strangely enough, she wasn\u2019t really part of the conversations because she was so high on pain meds; her mom was the one dominating every family conversation with her struggles of being a parent of someone so sick. We all felt so horrible and helpless that we of course wanted to support her and her family in every way, so we never noticed how much our dynamic shifted during those years. Our family was completely overtaken by my cousin\u2019s illness and my aunt\u2019s stress of caring for my cousin. (Mind you, during these years we had some other pretty significant family events take place, including other illnesses, deaths, surgeries, weddings, graduations, job wins, inter-state moves, a rehab stint, and even a cousin who was deployed to Iraq and then came home with PTSD; but none of those events were given even 1% of the attention of my cousin\u2019s illness.) \n\nFast-forward about 10 years later to today, and my cousin is 99% healed and living an independent life, but it\u2019s clear we should have kept more of a balance during the hell years.

She\u2019s straight-up exhausting to be around. \n\nHer mom, unsurprisingly, continues to tell stories of the hell years as if my cousin was still sick today. I can\u2019t begin to tell you how many family events continue to be dominated by my aunt\u2019s stories.

Similarly, my cousin never really built an adult life for herself either. \n\nIt\u2019s not like my cousin is at all sick anymore; her demanding nature is because she just got really used to everyone catering to her during those years. Unfortunately she now doesn\u2019t know how to tolerate even mild discomfort and will snap at all of us when even the tiniest things don\u2019t meet her expectations.

It's a wedding/child's birthday party/baby shower!\"\n\nI am guessing your sister loves to be the center of attention, and has stumbled upon an absolute goldmine of a situation. I am sure it is very little at all about Evie, and all about how much attention and pity she gets. Even people who are dying themselves realize there is a time and place to get into details. She doesn't have to \"pretend everything is okay\" but since she talks about it constantly everyone already knows it's not okay. It's totally normal to ask that that not become the focus of the child's birthday party. \n\nI think you set a good boundary, but you might need to be a little more blunt. \n\n\"Of course no one expects you to act like everything's okay, but we all know what's going on, no one is asking that of you. What I am asking is that you make sure the focus of the party stays on the person we're celebrating, and when you start going into long speeches, or into a lot of detail about it, it pulls attention away from the person we're there to celebrate. \n\nIf you need to talk about what's going on and want community support, that's available...but not during this party. If you're not there to focus your attention and the celebration on the birthday kid, it's best you stay home. Obviously if you need to stay home, that's perfectly okay. I am also not always in the mood for a party when I have hard stuff going on. But the way you monopolize gatherings and pull attention from the person we're celebrating isn't going to work at a party I'm throwing.\"\n\nAlso, I would start calling it out when it happens. At a baby shower, and she starts talking about Evie? Let her say a few sentences, and then interrupt and say \"But we're all here to focus our attention on this person and their new baby! Tell us, friend, how is decorating the nursery going?\"\n\nShe'll probably escalate and say something like \"I remember when I was decorating a nursery, and now my life is a living hell!\" \n\nYou just redirect again. \"Sounds like you might need a minute to step away and collect yourself. We all have difficult things going on in our lives, but let's not let that take the focus off of the reason we're here. Should we open presents?\"\n\nThis kind of redirection lets the other people at the gathering know \"This is inappropriate, you don't need to feel bad or let this ruin things, let's all give this person some space and move on.\"\n\nNTA", "So NTA, your sister sounds like the kind of person who LOVES to be the center of attention and will say or do just about anything to get that attention and will also throw an absolute fit when she doesn't get her way. Those kind of people drive me nuts.", "Nta for everything else, but I wouldn't have told her it'd be easier if she was a bio neice. That's just unnecessary hurt they're gonna use against you no matter what good reason you have to tell them this. It makes them think the other stuff you mentioned wasn't a problem but just excuses.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nWhat kind of person hijacks other people's celebrations like that?", "Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy?", "NTA\n\nIt is understandable that they are in pain and focused on Evie. However other people are entitled to not have their world revolve around your sister and her child.\n\nYour sons birthday party is not about Evie or your sister and her family. If she can't accept that then don't show up.", "NTA but wait, was Evie there during all of these incidents? Does she have the capability to understand she's being used for attention? If so, that poor, poor kid! Even more so than having to go through her medical stuff, having to be reminded that she's sick and won't live long each and every time there's a 'happy' occasion.", " NTA. Your sister doesn't actually care about her daughter's health. All she cares about is the attention she is getting over a sick little girl. Doesn't she understand the mental damage she is doing to a child by making her the center of a pity party wherever they go? I'd be asking if Evie is really as sick as her attention seeking parents claim she is.", "Ouch. I would recommend some counseling for them. Poor Evie has got to be tired of constantly hearing it too. NTA", "Nta. You shouldn't have invited her in the first place knowing that that's exactly what they'll do because they do any other time.", "NTA. It\u2019s okay to talk about your problems WHEN PROMPTED but when your just trying to divert attention onto another subject that\u2019s much more somber, it doesn\u2019t go over well most times\u2026 I feel that she should read the room a bit, but that isn\u2019t something some people get and need to be told to their face so it doesn\u2019t happen as much\u2026", "NTA. \n\nYou have aright to set that boundary.\n\nI really hope she can find some professional support as its clear despite bringing it up so much she must not be feeling heard or empathized with, and its clear its been brought up enough that at least some of those she's told have used empathetic language.\n\nAs others have mentioned it probably has something to do with the attention and sympathy that is garnered. \n\nI simultaneously feel for those whose boundaries she's crossed, as well as her a bit(There has to be some deep painful reason she craves the attention she's getting through her child), and especially for Evie.  However long she has , as long as the mother/sister keeps this up, her childhood will be centered on her illness.  Let her simply be just a child and do kid things", "NTA. This reads like an attention thing, especially the wedding toast part. And I don't know this person enough to make any deeper judgment than that.", "nta, the day is about your son not your sister and her family, she should be able to be respectful of that for one day for her nephew", "I\u2019m on two sides of this. One, they are obviously taking over everything with this, and putting it in a wedding speech is obviously in poor taste. However, I can also understand that this probably takes over everything in their minds, and it\u2019s impossible for them to stop thinking about it. Grief is hard and weird. I would say that it\u2019s crossing into her somewhat enjoying the attention and sympathy for this? Which to me, is concerning. \n\nI suppose you\u2019re in your right to not invite them, but I would recommend trying to have a better heart to heart with your sister. Explaining that you love your niece, deeply saddened about the situation, and it never leaves your mind but you can\u2019t begin to understand their grief. However you also want to have good memories with Evie and the family at these events, and for the children\u2019s sake, need to try to keep the events joyful. She doesn\u2019t need to pretend it\u2019s all fine - when asked, she can say, \u201cit\u2019s difficult but we are doing our best to enjoy this moment.\u201d", "NTA.  Can Evie come to the party without her parents??", "If Evie is this sick, why is she being dragged to all these events??? I\u2019m just reading this at random, but a baby suddenly sick to the point of repeated hospitalization, overly attention grabbing guardian, the making overtures to getting money, has Munchausen by proxy been ruled out? And OP NTA", "NTA- Oof. This is way to much. It\u2019s one thing to bring it up here and there. But not at every family function to the point that they be one center of attention. And the wedding was stepping way over the line! It sounds like they use Evie to get attention or sympathy. Perhaps they are overwhelmed with her illnesses and just need some pats on the back that they\u2019re doing a good job but it\u2019s not fair to ruin everyone else\u2019s event. Can you tell them just to drop Evie off for the party. This way maybe even Evie can enjoy being just a kid without hearing everyone talk about \u201cpoor Evie! She may not have long left\u201d. You know she\u2019s over heard people by now. What a downer and a way to ruin what time Evie has. Do not let her parents come. Whatever you do because you KNOW it\u2019s going to happen if you do.", "NTA. They need therapy, as this is parasitic attention feeding. And good for you for not enabling them.", "NTA\n\nThere is a way to integrate sick kids into situations without having to dwell on the illness.   I get that the illnesses have taken over their lives, but bringing normalcy to Evie's life and their own is important.  She and Adam have to snap out of it.  Maybe you should show the video of the wedding and reception speeches (generally recorded for posterity) and how she talked about it.   Maybe then she'll realize what a downer this is for everyone.", "Nta", "NTA\nmake it a kids only party maybe? \nNo reason for Evie to be left out", "NTA -drive it home and tell the sister Evie is invited just not sister.", "Nta", "Nta", "I thought but then I felt bad for armchair diagnosing. But atleast I'm not the only one thinking.", "Many years ago I attended a weeklong art workshop. One of the women kept talking about the child she & husband had adopted, referring to him as a \"little Russian boy\". Other attendees mentioned their children by name, \"My daughter Rachel\" or \" My son Mark\".   \n\n\nBut this woman always spoke of her \"son\" as a \"little Russian boy\". This really bothered me. As though the attention she received for adopting a child from Russia, was the most important attribute, such that he wasn't referred to by name.", "This was my thought too", "I had similar concerns, though I think caution is best. OP might want to make an anonymous report to social services if they also think this is possible.", "This is a unique ans \ud83e\udd23", "Not really. It's not hard to not talk about their pain for one day, especially if it's supposed to be happy days", "Jumping on this for visibility.

If the child is sick naturally then it isn\u2019t Munchausens.", "According to Wiki: \u201cIn 1951, Richard Asher was the first to describe a pattern of self-harm, wherein individuals fabricated histories, signs, and symptoms of illness. Remembering Baron Munchausen [a previously described ridiculous literary character], Asher named this condition Munchausen's Syndrome in his article in The Lancet in February 1951, quoted in his obituary in the British Medical Journal:\n\n\u201cHere is described a common syndrome which most doctors have seen, but about which little has been written. Like the famous Baron von Munchausen, the persons affected have always travelled widely; and their stories, like those attributed to him, are both dramatic and untruthful. Accordingly the syndrome is respectfully dedicated to the Baron, and named after him.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2009British Medical Journal, R.A.J. Asher, M.D., F.R.C.P.\n\nAsher's nomenclature sparked some controversy, with medical authorities debating the appropriateness of the name for about fifty years. While Asher was praised for bringing cases of factitious disorder to light, participants in the debate objected variously that a literary allusion was inappropriate given the seriousness of the disease; that its use of the anglicized spelling \"Munchausen\" showed poor form; that the name linked the disease with the real-life M\u00fcnchhausen, who did not have it; and that the name's connection to works of humor and fantasy, and to the essentially ridiculous character of the fictional Baron Munchausen, was disrespectful to patients with the disorder.\u201d", "And her parents are making her illness about them.

Very eye opening thank you.", "I love this for you!!!", "This is what I came to say", "Sorry, I found it quite interesting when I read it after learning about the name change - I had always assumed that the original name was based on the doctor or scientist who \u201cdiscovered\u201d it, as is often the case, and was gobsmacked to learn it was actually a literary reference!", "Thanks! I'm happy to be here and to have been blessed with the great kids I was blessed with. And now a grand child??? I never wanted kids to be honest, but I'm sure glad I have them and even if I could I wouldn't change a thing. My only wish is that I got to see them more, they're all grown and living their lives but we do talk every day so My life and my heart are both still full."]}
