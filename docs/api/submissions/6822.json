We're throwing him his first big birthday party that will have both friends and family. He's so excited for it. My sister and her husband Adam have my niece Evie who is 8. Evie is adopted. This becomes somewhat relevant due to the argument. But when she was 2 Evie was diagnosed with a string of medical conditions and health problems. Some more serious than the rest. She's in and out of hospital and they have been warned her life might not be long, if they cannot manage all the various health problems Evie has. It was a huge blow for my sister and Adam but the whole family.\n\nEvie's health has become a topic that gets brought up at everything. Two family weddings were taken over when my sister brought up how sick Evie was, and alluded to the fact she did not have long left (despite her assuring the family on a number of occasions that things were not that bad). One of those weddings was our brother's wedding. One minute the happy couple are the center of attention and the next people are talking about how sad that he has a terminally ill niece and the focus moves onto them. She even made a big deal of talking about Evie's health during the toast and it sounded almost like she was asking someone to start a crowdfunding thing for them to pay for treatments, without outright asking that. My brother was furious and his wife, Mia, was upset that instead of being a happy day, most people ended up in a very somber mood at the wedding.\n\nThis has also happened at birthday parties, block parties, etc. She brought it up at a couple of baby showers we attended together and I assume some outside of that also.\n\nIt's a lot and every time it feels everyone ends up sad, depressed and uncomfortable. My sister and Adam have been spoken to about it before and they claim they don't do it. Evie doesn't always get what's going on and sometimes she's too poorly to care.\n\nWith my oldest son's party coming up, I felt like this was something I needed to try to prevent. So I asked her if she would not bring up Evie's health at the party. She told me she's not going to pretend everything is okay if people ask and that it's important to make it known so people don't try to push her too much. I told her I do not want the whole party to become about Evie being sick again. She told me that's unfair and I know why. So I told her they shouldn't come to the party if they only want to bring up Evie's health. My sister was furious. She accused me of not caring about Evie being sick because she's adopted, said I would be more understanding if Evie was my bio niece. Even asked me why I cared so little about her. She also told me I was an asshole for trying to gloss over the pain they feel and for excluding them when they live in hell every day.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673199932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106p88u/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_and_her_family/", "score": 292, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For your sister, talking about her daughter's situation obviously makes it a bit easier for her to deal with it. However, just because it makes her feel better doesn't make her entitled to talk about it in any and every situation. Other people have their own lives with their own hardships as well as happy times, and they should be allowed to fully experience those happy times when they do come. It is not only disrespectful, but actually somewhat abusive of her to insist that because her and her husband live in hell every day, everyone else should have to get a glimpse into the pain they feel every day.

I guess I don't understand why this can't be resolved with a little bit of cooperation and compromise on both your parts. It might have been better to discuss your concerns first before telling your sister what to do. It also seems that your sister should understand and respect your feelings. I have cancer and I dont tell people about it because it brings the room down. Your sister has to understand this. Also, the non-bio comment reflects her insecurities more than your feelings and maybe when things calm down check in on your sister about this. It was unfair of her to say that though.

NTA - but close to everyone here sucks.  Sister should not be there if you don't want her there.", "NTA. It seems like your sister gets off on the attention she gets from Evie being sick. I\u2019m also concerned for Evie: does she not get to have one day without her own mortality and short life-span being brought up? I understand that everyone is different, and she is only 8, but friends of mine have faced terminal diagnoses before and most of them did not want people constantly reminding them \u201comg you\u2019re gonna die, like, so soon huh?\u201d When my mom was dealing w glioblastoma, she had an in-law similar to your sister: my mom could not go to a single fucking family event w/out this other person standing up and making a huge deal that this was probably my mom\u2019s last X (birthday, Christmas, April Fools, tax day etc. Bitch even made a whole Christmas card about MY MOTHERS diagnosis. And sent it not only to her Christmas list but found my mom\u2019s friends/work/acquaintances. Psychotic)\n\nI do not think it is selfish to live while you are alive. I do not think it is selfish to celebrate YOUR child even though this other child may not have long to live (or maybe she does. My bestie made it to 30 with a condition that should have killed her at infancy and again before she reached puberty. She got a phd, traveled, fell in love. Yes, she did pass away,but she also got to live for 30 years and she loved her life. Her heart stopped while out w friends, she died instantly in a very happy moment. My mom is still alive 17 years post glioblastoma diagnosis, which is hella rare to survive that long. There are literally no guarantees)\n\nIf your sister hijacks your son\u2019s birthday, it is ultimately truly unfair to your son and also to Evie.", "NTA. It would of been a good opportunity to call her out on her inappropriate wedding speech and other antics also.

Your son doesn\u2019t deserve to have all the attention shifted to something so sad on a day that will be bringing him so much joy, but evie doesn\u2019t deserve to be excluded. And being adopted, that shit gets trickier and feels really weird \u2026 doubly so (I\u2019m adopted). \n\nI don\u2019t know what the answer for you is, but my heart hurts for both kids. I would say YTA based solely on this entire conversation is centered around adult feelings rather then the children\u2019s feelings and this is a child\u2019s party. Your sister is clearly also an ass but like: terminal illness in a child is REALLY FUCKING HARD. She shouldn\u2019t be dominating every room she walks into with her woes. That\u2019s not healthy for HER nor is it for her child like at all. She needs therapy to help process what is happening.", "YTA. Actually why don\u2019t you just tell them you don\u2019t care a lick about Evie or their struggles and ask them to only reach out if they have something g positive to share? That\u2019s how you feel right? Do you see now how awful that is? \n\nYou understand your child or your partner could fall ill in a way that would dominate your whole life, right?

You are trying to advocate for your son which is what a parent does.  Your sister is suffering a lot and seeking to get reassurance and sympathy all the time from everyone. I am sorry for her pain and for her little one's illness, but she is running a high risk of chasing everyone away if she can't let a 7 year old be the center of attention at his own birthday party.\n\nI don't know your sister or what her motivations are, but in chronic illness and in disability we sometimes see patients (or their caregivers) chasing secondary gain, where they start to use their health issues as a way to get and hold attention and sympathy in appropriately and it is just a form of self-centeredness.  They can end up being very much alone because eventually people aren't willing to allow them to be continuously the center of the earth.", "I know debilitating illnesses happen more often than I would like to know, especially to children. But reading this, I just couldnt help but think about Gypsy Rose. Your sister is just so... attention seeking over it, its insane.

If it were accomodations needed for the child that would be a different story, but this is literally them just seeking attention.\n\nIf they dont have a therapist, they need one NOW.

That would explaim her behaviour", "Tell your sister that it\u2019s not you who treats Evie like adopted but it\u2019s her who thinks that. Because no mother can try to grab attention of people by talking about their children is sick and going to die soon. It\u2019s something that a mother can\u2019t talk out loudly.
