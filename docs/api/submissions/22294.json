So I agree with OP and everyone else noting that it wasn't in good taste for the boyfriend to ask OP to pay for a haircut, especially since he just assumed he'll be paid and didn't let OP know beforehand. But I assume OP didn't express his distaste of having to pay for his haircut. I also don't think it was in good taste for OP to passively aggressively throw it back in his boyfriends face with him asking for eclairs.\nMaybe just sit down together and express why you didn't appreciate having to pay for the haircut and you don't want to be in a relationship where you both have to pay for doing things for each other; it might be more effective than trying to make a point via tit-for-tat digs.

I couldn't imagine charging someone I love for something I can do to make their life easier or better.

I think it\u2019s odd that he charged you especially after offering to cut your hair. I personally think that baking eclairs takes way more effort and time than a haircut. I do think you should have a conversation and tell him how you feel and ask him why he charged you, and tell him how you feel about it.

Like, dating for less than a year and finding you have vastly different ideas about generosity, favours and reciprocity and that that IS going to impact your relationship *therefore you break up* is literally why we date. \n\nNo one owes anyone a relationship. And which incompatibilities and differences are acceptable and worth pushing through and which you can\u2019t tolerate vary VASTLY by person. My husband raised by parents who grew up in a culture that hugely emphasizes generosity and hospitality (his parents are from Newfoundland in Canada) would absolutely fun me if I was like OPs bf - because that\u2019s a core ethic in his culture and family. Just because it\u2019s no big deal to YOU didn\u2019t mean it\u2019s no big deal. \n\nThe other factor for breaking up is: can you see this incompatibility changing or shifting over time or via compromise? Because if it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll ever be able to meet in the middle then the emotional frustration about the incompatibility will just grow. I\u2019d read this as something bf isn\u2019t open about compromise on. \n\nNTA.", "He literally ran and told people personal stuff that should have stayed between them. Your person isn't supposed to share with people every time you argue or fight and especially not try to get people to turn against you. It's messed up. The reason you don't share fights is because no one is inside the relationship but you two and others don't see the same way you do. They'll form their own judgement of your s/o then you're stuck forever with people not liking them and judging them when you've already gotten over the argument", "scorched earth is pretty standard relationship advice on this sub.", "Don't forget to send collection notices for services previously rendered!

Sure, there can be deal breakers, but having a few conflicts isn't grounds enough for me to throw the relationship away without trying to work on them. So even at 3 or 4 months I'd want to try to work stuff out.", "Thanks. Fixed it.", "It's not a trust issue. It's a respect issue. Trust issues is just another one I wouldn't bother fixing. \n\nIt is a respect issue. If you value your labour enough to charge your partner for it, but don't value their labour enough to pay them for it, you consider yourself worth more than them. That's a respect issue. \n\n> Also, can we stop using quotation marks when we are just making shit up...???\n\nNo. They are called scare quotes. I frequently use them in writing to distance the words I'm saying from my own personal view. That's literally one of the uses of quotation marks. \n\nCan you stop using ellipses when you're done a sentence?

It\u2019s something that should have been discussed upfront and you are partners, seems to be too transactional of a relationship at this point.  But a discussion over expectations would be wise, then you can decide to continue or move on.", "My biggest question here is:  How much free tech support has OP given his bf?  Because I grew up in a tech household and everyone I know who isn't in tech themselves (and even some who are, because apparently genetic memory means I automatically know more? I don't understand the logic here) has asked me for tech support.", "Break up and red flags are the go to recommendation for relationship issues in this sub. \n\nBut it kind of makes sense, posts can be deleted for being too long, and generally the post is focused around a bad thing someone has done in a relationship. Readers, absent any of the good context surrounding the person in question rush to suggest extremes because they see extremes.", "The point of dating is a long form tryout. If you have different values? That's a totally emotionally intelligent reason to breakup.\n\nI agree with the bf barber should be compensated for his time but wildly, he doesn't seem to value his partner's investments equally. He should expect to pay for his partner's area of expertise (IT). He should expect to fund baking because maybe OP bakes for free, but his ingredients are not! In fact, baking is pricey. \n\nIt's not a lifelong commitment unless the parties involved have made it so.", "If your goal is to find a lifelong partner that's compatible, you're wasting your time. You need to be compatible on big things, work on the little things.", "Seriously.

Sometimes it warrants a restraining order. In this case it probably just warrants an \u201cI don\u2019t feel like you respect my skills or are willing to treat me like an equal partner, and that\u2019s a dealbreaker for me\u201d conversation.", "If you break up with someone over issues that aren't established as deal breakers early on, or that are in no way abusive and/or manipulative, I think it speaks volumes to your own inability to discuss and address issues with others, if you're finding yourself quick to disassociate with others without giving them the opportunity to change their behavior.\n\nHealthy relationships are built on providing space to create accountability, you can't build those foundations if you view the minor differences in behavior as worth severing the relationship. \n\nOP should be discussing this issue and trying to come to a mutual agreement. If the discussion of this issue then brings about more concerning behaviours or patterns, then *that* should be the time to break apart the relationship and move on.", ">No. They are called scare quotes.

If someone offered to do something for me I would expect they would tell me upfront if they will charge me for it.", "I agree with your way of thinking. People get way too committed way too quickly.

There are a lot of people in this world who do not offer the trades of their labour for free, to anyone.\n\nI think breaking up over this issue without an attempt at trying to communicate about the issue is actually immature and shows an inability to address issues without going nuclear. It tells people that you're quick to pull the trigger and need constant gratification from someone in order to build a relationship with them.\n\nOP isn't TA, the boyfriend did a dumb thing, but 7 months is still quite a long time to blow up a relationship over charging 20 Euros for a haircut. They need to talk about equivalent exchange and treatment, and that services performed is services paid.\n\nThe reason why his friends and family get free goodies is because they offer his free stuff, if the BF is transactional about his professional services, then that's a boundary that they need to establish because OP should be as well.", "No, but it is your job to teach them how to treat you.

If this was the only expectation at play, OPs boyfriend would simply pay OP for baking for him, and that would be the standard in the relationship. \n\nThe issue is he's expecting payment for his skills and labour, but feels entitled to his partners skills and labour for free.

I kind of buy that. I think a huge shift with an addition vs a huge shift with a removal probably need different words, but both probably do have the same scale of change attached. I think the difference with marriage vs a sudden breakup is just that marriage has a big lead up. Every day you keep making the choice to continue, and even after you can get a divorce. Maybe it's more similar to a spur of the moment pregnancy.\n\nI still think it's pretty abrupt to just breakup over this without even trying to have a proper conversation and I'd still call it scorched earth to jump the gun so fast, but I'll buy that my argument for why could be better."]}
