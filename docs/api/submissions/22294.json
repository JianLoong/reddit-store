I work in IT and he is a barber. The other day, i wanted to go get a haircut but didnt want to go downtown for it, so he recommended he cuts my hair for me at home. The haircut was fine, i dont really ask for anything crazy, just a standard male haircut. After we were done though, he asked me if i liked it, i said yes and then he said \"you can just paypal me the money, no need to get your wallet\". I, at first, thought he was joking and laughed it off but he didn't seem to understand why and i just transferred him the 20 Euros he asked for (kinda normal price for where i live, would have been much more at the salon he works at). Oh, and i cleaned up because it was my hair (?).\n\nNow, something that has been happening between us is that he sends me instagram reels or tiktoks with baked goods and asks me if i can make them for him. I am no professional baker, but i do bake as a hobby and have made wedding/ birthday cakes for friends and family and if its an order i usually just ask for the ingredients. Most of the time i can make the ones he sends me, maybe not as presentable, but mostly the same.\n\nA few days ago he, once again, sent me a tiktok with some chocolate eclairs and asked me if i can make them and i told him \"Between the ingredients and my time, you'd be better off buying some at a bakery\" he didnt understand at first but eventually, he did and he didn't take it too well.\n\nHe called me petty and said that this isn't my job, it's just a hobby etc. some of our common friends agree with him, saying i am being cheap and petty but some agreed with me that if he wants to charge me, he shouldn't expect me not to.\n\nSo AITA for charging my bf?", "created_utc": 1689418318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1508wgl/aita_for_charging_my_boyfriend_for_baked_goods/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have only ever charged friends and family the out of pocket expenses when commissioned to do things.", "Oh, I hate this.

It resultet in my dad physically holding him down whilst i slipped the money into his pockets.", "NTA\n\nIf you have to pay for his services, it is only fair for him to do the same.", "NTA. If you went to his salon I understand why he would charge you. But he suggested that he cut your hair at home, I would be surprised too if someone charged me for that. Next time ask if he was offering for free.", "NTA\n\nThat is incredibly tight of him.  I get it is his job but probably only took him half hour in your own home and isn't causing him to lose earnings.  \n\nNext time he ask for any IT related advice charge him for consultancy.", "NTA. It *is* petty, but he's not entitled to your baking. While you could decide to lead by example and do it for free just to be nice if you wanted to, you're not obligated to bake for anyone so choosing not to doesn't make you TA. \n\nEven if you're not a baker by trade, it's still your time, effort & expertise that he wants you to spend serving him. If he respects your time & skills as a baker like he expects you to respect him as a hairdresser, it's not unreasonable to expect him to pay for it, according to the precedent set by your bf.\n\nI think probably YWBTA if you dragged this issue out and started charging him for your time and labour for every little thing just to make a point. But for this one-off favour it makes sense. He could at least pay for the ingredients. NTA.", "NTA. As a couple, it\u2019s a little weird to charge each other to provide services in the home. Oh, you made dinner honey? Let me PayPal you $25. Oh a back rub? Well that\u2019s $50/hour. Oh you mowed the lawn, how much do I owe you? You get the point. I understand cutting hair is his job, but Im sure you do things in return for free.", "NTA, but your bf is.", "NTA.  Seven months into the relationship, it is natural to still be sorting out boundaries and figuring out how to relate to each other.  He pushed you a bit, and you pushed back.  This is not a five-alarm fire.  Stand your ground.  You don't want to be taken for granted.", "NTA.\n\nHe should have told you beforehand that he could cut your hair only if you pay. The fact that he cuts first and tell you to pay after, when you could clearly think it was just a treat since you are his GF, was an AH move.\n\nOf course, asking you to be paid for something you usually do for free is also an AH move but it was one time and mostly to prove a point (why spending time and money for him if he charges you when he does the same) so i guess that's ok.", "Petty?

Him having you clean up after you paid is BS.

Why don\u2019t you just discuss why the haircut charge made you upset instead of being so petty? Do you care about this relationship?", "ESH. \n\nBaking is a hobby you enjoy, not your profession. If he asked you for IT work, sure, charge him, but trying to do it with baked goods is petty as hell. (Edited to add:) You should have talked to him about how you felt about being charged, instead of playing games and being childish. \n\nBarbering is his profession, but you\u2019re his Bf and this was done at home. He should have at the very least discussed you paying him beforehand so that you could make the decision if you wanted to bring your professional lives into the relationship and be transactionary or just keep your professions out of it.", "NAH \n\nHair is his profession and his scissors and clippers/blades aren't cheap to buy or get sharpened. \n\nBaking isn't your profession, but ingredients aren't cheap and baking anything takes longer than a standard guy haircut. \n\nA haircut is a once a monthish thing... How often do you bake?\n\nYou are early in the relationship. Seems like this might require a sit  down. Are you into a transactional relationship, where every thing is measured?

You are free to charge him as he is you.", "NTA. Tell your friends and bf, baking is not your hobby. It is now a side hustle.", "Wow. NTA\n\nJust because he's a barber he thinks that's a reason to charge you?  How many times have you helped with anything IT related?  IT people are always expected to fix IT things without getting paid.  And it doesn't matter that you're not a professional baker. Baking is a skill that takes time and ingredients cost money.  \n\nIf he can charge for his time and skill, so can you. I would have a serious conversation about this.  If he can't even do you a favor without expecting something back, what's that say about this relationship?", "NTA.

Gonna make some of those now lol. \n\nNTA, some people are really petty with money. I have learned that it\u2019s always better to speak up about it and charge them for what you do if they charge you for what they do. It\u2019s only fair, and curbs resentment building. \n\nYou guys might not be compatible, as he is very transactional. Good on you for standing up for and making him recognize your value!", "Are you a professional thermostat changer?\n\nOP's bf is a barber. I still think they're the AH, but it's not directly comparable.", "I've never charged him before, not even for ingredients, because we are in a relationship. I only did it to get my point across. Other than that i can say that we are pretty good together, and this is why i feel kinda like shit for doing this.", "Is this a typo or did you and everyone who upvoted you somehow missed that they're in a relationship?

I'm just picturing two dudes wrestling around with one screaming \"you're taking this money whether you like it or not!\"", "Yeah, that was my POV too, we couldn't start doing this. I didnt say it to him just to get paid, but to make a point", "Yeah, i didn't really expect him to pay, mostly i wanted to get my point through, that we cant be charging each other for everything we do for one another, he seems to disagree because he provided a service and just baked...", "LoL! Glad I'm not in a relationship with YOU...Bottom line is: If they did not discuss \\*payment\\* for services rendered \\*before\\* the haircut, eclairs, thermostat...then its a bullshit move to ask for it \\*after\\* the service is rendered and cannot be undone. If you are defending that...you got your own problems to work out.", "He started it. NTA but he is.", "Your actions are excusable absolutely but it would be more mature to have had the conversation at the point you were bothered than to passive aggressively make the point later on. The message was fine, delivery less so.", "\u201cJust baked\u201d. If that\u2019s your bf\u2019s take on it, tell him to do his own baking. You deserve to be treated better than that. \n\nDo you have joint finances? If you don\u2019t, point out to him that he already had the tools and skills for barbering. Baking, however, puts you out of pocket for supplies, not to mention is WAAAAAY more time-consuming than cutting hair.\n\nAre you really happy with someone who views your relationship as transactional?"]}
