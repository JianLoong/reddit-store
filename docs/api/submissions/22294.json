So I agree with OP and everyone else noting that it wasn't in good taste for the boyfriend to ask OP to pay for a haircut, especially since he just assumed he'll be paid and didn't let OP know beforehand. But I assume OP didn't express his distaste of having to pay for his haircut. I also don't think it was in good taste for OP to passively aggressively throw it back in his boyfriends face with him asking for eclairs.\nMaybe just sit down together and express why you didn't appreciate having to pay for the haircut and you don't want to be in a relationship where you both have to pay for doing things for each other; it might be more effective than trying to make a point via tit-for-tat digs.
