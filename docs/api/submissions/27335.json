I have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for almost a year and a half now. I have never been in a long term relationship before, but he has been in a few. Yet, he never went to college and has been living at home his entire life. \n\n**Side note** before I continue, it\u2019ll help to know that his dad had an accident and suffered from a \u201cbrain anoxia\u201d injury three years ago. He has to help take care of his dad with his mom as well as help raise his 14 year old brother. His dad is now fully disabled. He lost his eye sight and is considered \u201cfull time care.\u201d\n \nAs of now, he\u2019s been living with me 98% of the time and has not helped pay for rent, utilities, or internet. He has bought groceries twice and paid for a lot of little things (light bulbs, toaster, decor, eating out, etc.) I told him it has to change moving forward. Another note to know is that my job is an hour and a half of a commute away. His job is very different as he only commutes 30 minutes. \n\nThis past week, he asked me if it was okay for his family and hometown friend who is in the military come over for dinner. I said I prefer for it to not be on a weekday. But we would be out of town this weekend with my mom and his friend would be leaving on Monday. So a weekday was his only choice. He told me he would cook and have everything ready by the time I got home and I wouldn\u2019t have to do anything. \n\nI came home around 6:45 PM that day and everyone was already there. They actually had been there for almost an hour. They made themselves perfectly comfortable. It made me so mad. So i stayed quiet. I helped serve dinner, I cleaned up the kitchen for everyone, then we all chatted and they left around 8:30. \n\nAs my boyfriend and I went to bed that night, he expressed to me how he didn\u2019t appreciate the way I acted. He even said I was acting like a bitch. I told him, \u201cYou invite YOUR family and YOUR friend into MY apartment that you don\u2019t 100% live in yet, nor have helped pay ANY rent and have the nerve to call me a bitch because I was not in a social mood? The audacity.\u201d I was furious. He apologized soon after, but still stood by what he said. I told him that I didn\u2019t mean to come off that way and I\u2019m sorry you feel that way, but you still had no right.  \n\nI understand he wants me to be close with his family, I do too, but I have my limits. He has a completely different relationship with his parents than I do with mine. So I\u2019m trying to be accommodating and supportive, but like I said, I have my limits. Especially when it comes to my home. \n\nI then proceeded to tell him the next day that it is now a boundary for us that as long as he lives with me in my apartment, family or parents (on both ends) can\u2019t come over on weeknights. If I\u2019m working from home, then we can discuss, but otherwise the answer is no.

You obviously resent that he's not paying rent, but you acknowledge that he's living with you 98% of the time. You should be talking about him paying rent. Instead, you're holding that resent about him not participating in caring for the household against him by being angry about unrelated things. Whether he pays rent or not, *he does live there, by your own admission*. If you're living together--and *you are--*it's not just *your* house anymore. It's both of your home. If you're sharing a home, neither of you get to make unilateral decisions anymore. \n2. You also seem to be holding the difference in your commuting times against him, which is unfair. Your commute isn't his fault. \n3. Unless I'm misunderstanding the story, *you agreed to the visit*. \"I said I prefer for it to not be on a weekday. But we would be out of town this weekend with my mom and his friend would be leaving on Monday. So a weekday was his only choice.\" You would have preferred it not be on a weekday, but that wasn't possible, so it had to be a weekday visit. Given that, it's not fair for you to be *angry* that they visited and \"made themselves comfortable.\" Would it have somehow been better for them to have stood around awkwardly and been *uncomfortable* for some reason? \n4. It sounds like you weren't just quiet, but that you might have been somewhat hostile towards his guests, given that he specifically made a point to bring up that he wasn't happy about how you treated them.\n5. That said: he doesn't get to call you a bitch because you were unhappy. That's not okay partner behavior. \n6. He also needs to step up and contribute to the household. If he's living there, he needs to share in the rent and in the responsibilities that go into caring for a household. \n\nUltimately, this whole situation doesn't actually sound like it's about this specific visit; it sounds like it's a deeper problem in your relationship, and you both need to work on it. Setting boundaries like \"nobody is ever allowed to visit during the weekdays\" isn't really a fair boundary when it's a shared living situation, but absolutely refusing to pay rent or contribute to work/expenses isn't, either. \n\nYou guys need to work this shit out, or you'll be living alone again.", "YTA\n\nBy the way you tell it, your boyfriend asked and you reluctantly agreed because it was the only option. If you didn't want anyone over, you should not have agreed. \n\n>They made themselves perfectly comfortable. It made me so mad.\n\nThis is why I think YTA. What are invited guests supposed to do when they come over? Be uncomfortable? That's shitty logic. I would be more inclined to agree if they were going through your stuff, rearranging shit, etc, but you don't mention any of those things.", "*They made themselves perfectly comfortable*\n\nINFO: This wasn't a surprise, and it turns out you didn't have to do anything to set up the event at least, so why were you so mad?", "INFO: Will this rule change if your SO starts contributing to rent?", "YTA. \n\nYour boyfriend did exactly what he was supposed to do: he asked permission. Guests arrived. He did what a host is supposed to do: he entertained the guests. \n\nFurthermore, and I cannot stress this enough:\n\nWhat you laid down is NOT a boundary. It is a rule. There is a difference. \n\nFinally, if your boyfriend \u201clives with you 98%,\u201d as you\u2019ve indicated, he\u2019s living with you and just visiting his folks. This true *regardless of who is paying the rent*. It\u2019s y\u2019all\u2019s apartment now and you should extend to him the rights and privileges afforded to a SO with whom you live. \n\nIf you\u2019re unwilling to agree to these things, he needs to move out and live somewhere else. But YTA for laying down the law about what will and will not happen in \u201cyour\u201d apartment, especially when he asked first.", "YTA - why on earth were you angry? He said they were coming for dinner and they came for dinner.", "YTA.\n\nYou agreed and then were horrible about it. That's your choice.\n\nBut demanding he's not allowed to have family over during the week should you opt to live together? That's not a boundary that's a demand that you are giving him \\*zero\\* input on.", "YTA\n\nIt was obviously a special occasion given your other commitments. \n\nLife is about seizing the moment and you can't always be rigid for the sake of it. \n\nI was expecting to you to say he was doing this weekly or something. \n\nYour rage is misdirected bc he is not contributing financially. Deal with that instead of being inhospitable to something that has happened once. \n\nPeople like generous people.", "YTA. You agreed to this dinner, and it sounds like all you had to do was put on a friendly face for less than two hours, and you couldn't even do that. Also -- you can't set boundaries on other people, only within yourself.", "Yta so you said yes and then.....got mad that he took it as a yes?    If you didn't want it to happen then say 'no'.  Don't dance around and get mad when he takes you at your word.", "Lol this can't even be real.", "YTA for how you reacted. You agreed to the dinner and you listed zero bad behaviors by him or any guests so it sounds like you regretted your choice and took it out on him. \n\nIf he's going to be paying rent to live with you you cannot unilaterally bar him from having his family over. Once he starts paying he has rights too so this is something you guys really need to figure out", "YTA. Soo...you agreed to the dinner, albeit reluctantly, and then acted liked a petulant child when you came home and saw people there, when you knew they would in fact be at your house?? \n\nIf you were that tired, there are polite ways to excuse yourself. You seem insulted that guests would make themselves at home. That is like..the classic guest line lol....\n\nI get that you were not thrilled about this but your bf asked and was told he could. He did what he asked and you acted nasty. \n\nObviously you resent him living there most of the time and not paying rent. Fair enough. And you aren't a fan of visitors during the week. That is your prerogative. You both obviously have some issues to work out. \n\nHowever, how you handled this was completely inappropriate and I wonder, are you mature enough to be in a relationship? This was more how a spoiled teenager would act.", "Ugh.  The audacity.  You probably told him you want him to feel at home there, too.  \n\nHe's not your employee and you don't get to set corporate policy in your shared home.  You're not the manager here. \n\nHe needs to run, far and fast. Hopefully, he can find someone who enjoys quality time with family.  That's a big value not to share.  YTA", "YTA - you said he could have them over and then you're pissed that he had them over, made dinner, and they dared to \"make themselves comfortable.\" What exactly would you have preferred to walk in on?", "YTA.\n\nGrow up. I\u2019ve been with the same partner for 20 years. Compromises must be made.", "ESH just break up already", "YTA. Maybe a serious relationship where you live together isn\u2019t for you.", "Jesus Christ, YTA.", "N T A with a condition\n\nIf he is not paying for anything towards the house, then he needs to respect your rules.\n\nHe can renegotiate if he ever steps though. If you want him to contribute, you\u2019ll also have to accept that his word and opinions will equal to yours and you can\u2019t be the only one calling the shots anymore by that point. You\u2019ll have to figure out a compromise\n\nEDIT: Actually, now that I\u2019m reading more of your comments, YTA. You overall sound very much like a my way or the highway sort and have no intention of treating him like an equal around the house once he starts controbuting", "YTA. Expect him to not live with you. Based on what you have said it will always be your apartment and he'll just live there, even if he is paying bills, which means he'll have to live by your rules. You agreed to the dinner and still behaved badly. If he's smart he'll stay where he is and retain the freedom to see his family.", "YTA. You already knew that they were gonna be there. If you didn't want company, then you should've said so from the start. Not fussed at him after the fact.", "so they cant come over at all? cause usually people work a 9am-5pm shift. smdh. id leave ur sketch assparagus. YTA. u know his family issues. and its best if he just left to live somewhere else. it is UR place. and it will be a lonely/miserable one.", "The elephant in the room no one is really addressing. You live way too far from your job, you are paying for 2 to live and you have a boyfriend who can never leave his caretaking of his family. Something has got to give. Get a new closer job or break up for now and move closer to your job and save for your future.", ">I then proceeded to tell him the next day that it is now a boundary for us that as long as he lives with me in my apartment, family or parents (on both ends) can\u2019t come over on weeknights. If I\u2019m working from home, then we can discuss, but otherwise the answer is no.\n\nThat's not a boundary.  That's a demand that he gets no input in.  People in relationships don't get to arbitrarily make demands like this without any input into it.  He may not be paying rent yet, he should be or should be soon, but it he's living there with you as a couple, he should get some sort of say in how the home is run.  \n\nYTA", "YTA. You agreed to host the gathering? And then you were angry that guests were there? Unfortunately, I think there was no way your BF could know you didn't want guests at your home *before* you arrived. You didn't use your words. (He did actually manage everything as he said he would, right?) 6:45 P.M. is a late dinner for lots of people So, when were they supposed to arrive? 7:30? 8 P.M.?\n\nAt any rate you behaving rudely to the assembled guests reflects poorly on you. But, if you don't want any more guests during your work week, that is reasonable to say out loud. (No matter that they were HIS family and HIS friend - you agreed they'd be guests in YOUR home. Stop acting like you were amazed to find them there. ***You*** *agreed to it and didn't define your boundaries.)*\n\nBut, there is nothing wrong with you not wanting further guest appearances during the week as you go forward.", "Yes you are. I hope he gets the hell out.", "YTA - I think if you want him to be a paying member of the house, he gets to have a say in guests. \"once a week\" \"not on my busy Tuesday\" or \"out by 830pm\" would be reasonable compromises. Your \"boundary\" is just you being a bit controlling", "Why couldn't they just go out to Cheesecake Factory or Friday's or something?\n\nWhy was it a requirement that he cook in your apartment?  Was it a money issue for the family?", "NTA. He said friend not the whole family. Family could\u2019ve hosted dinner at their place or they all could\u2019ve gone to a restaurant.", "NTA. But why are you living with him in the first place. He\u2019s a mooch.", "NTA For future reference, this is not a \"boyfriend\" this is a \"parasite\" you have moving into your place. Get him out of there before he quits his job or gets fired, and he can become a full-time parasite.", "NTA. I really think you need to move on from this guy.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not ready to live together, that's item number 1.  Item number 2, it's your home and you can act however you want, set boundaries how you want, etc.  For number 3, he was incredibly rude to say that to you, I'm surprised you didn't send him home for the night.\n\nIf the plan is that he's going to be a caregiver to his family you need to consider if that's something you want to deal with.  It's OK to not be alright with it and end the relationship over it, because it sounds like that's the direction this is going.", "I have read lots of comments so far and I feel like additional information is needed: \n1. My boyfriend wants to help pay my bills. He is budgeting right now with his job and side jobs being a commercial electrician, however will start paying next month. \n2. I felt like I was put in a corner about this dinner. If I said no, he would be upset that I didn\u2019t want to spend time with them. But I said yes, and he still got upset. So I felt like I was in a loose loose situation. Seeing a lot of comments, I should have said no and suggested something else (going out, going over to his house, etc.) \n3. That specific work day I had almost a 12 hour day, and I was exhausted. It wasn\u2019t my intention to act \u201cbitchy\u201d or stand off ish, I just was not in a great mood. I did apologize to him for the way I acted and I didn\u2019t mean for it to come off that way. \n4. We want to live together. Originally I was hesitant, but with my family issues, I like having the company and feeling like I have a family of my own with him. Plus, it\u2019s an important step to work several kinks of our relationship and living habits out before we get engaged. Which won\u2019t happen for the next few years. \n5. I don\u2019t want this boundary to be forever. It\u2019s definitely not right nor fair to him or myself. But it\u2019s just until we get used to our jobs more and have a better schedule. Plus we are so exhausted from our work days, I want both of us to have time to relax and rest before the next day. \n\nI appreciate the advice and concern lots of commenters have. I am confident we will come to a compromise that works for the both of us. Even though he doesn\u2019t pay rent or bay any serious bills, he still does so much for me and my apartment right now and I want him to start feeling like this is his home. Like I said, the boundary isn\u2019t forever, just until we have a better \u201cwrap\u201d on our new adult life. Thank you everyone.", "NTA.  You can set whatever boundaries you want for YOUR house.  He doesn't live there, he doesn't pay rent, he doesn't contribute to the household expenses.  Next time he wants to entertain, tell him to do it at HIS parents' house.  He has 0 input on YOUR house.  He's using you.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t let him stay the night anymore. He has a lot of audacity for a mooch", "ESH but you are the primary asshole. However, who is the asshole seems pretty far from the main issue here. \n\n  \nIf he is incapable of paying for himself he is probably not in a place to be in a relationship right now.

End of story. If she wants a say so on what goes on there, then he can start ponying up 50% of all the bills. But here is a word of caution, if he disrespected your place, when he is not paying, and does not live there, how do you think he is going to act if he is living there full-time and paying half of the bills. You are definitely NTA asshole in the situation", "NTA, but make sure he pays you rent and pays his share of the utilities. Frankly, I'm not sure I'd want to live with someone who had the audacity to criticize me after inviting people over on a work night against my wishes.", "NTA\n\nStand your ground, you was clear with the boundaries and he crossed the line.\n\nYour house, your rules.\n\nTake care.", "NTA - your house your rules. why is he living with you and not contributing to the cost of it all.

Why should he have any say in who visits YOUR apartment at ANY time??   He contributes NOTHING to your apartment, and sounds like, NOTHING to your relationship.\n\nYou need to rethink this relationship entirely.", "NAH. It sounds like you're frustrated by a few things, but you also never set up ground rules or expectations about living together with your BF. \n\nYou agreed to have people over but were tired and not feeling social. Calling you a B for that isn't okay. \n\nExplain to them that you feel strained from finances and the commute and that you aren't as open with your home as his family may be.

This is reasonable. Even if he's actually there most of the time, he's not paying bills/rent so it's your space and you set the rules.\n\nYou throwing a tantrum AFTER he had cleared a friend visit with you before hand, because they were in your apartment before you got home? That would be a different question. He asked, he made reasonable efforts, and you got angry. I suspect you regret giving him the green light for this, but you did and should have sucked it up for that evening at least. Fine, you know now that this isn't something you can stand, so make a rule about it, but I'm with your BF about how you behaved on the night.", "NTA\n\n\nYou have a right to be annoyed that that they arrived way before you and that had to clean up.

He comes with a dynamic that you aren't used to - he's lived at home, is close to his family, and his family experienced a shattering dynamic in their everyday life - unexpected and huge for all of them. He's taking advantage of you, but is likely also looking for a little bit of respite from his intense family life.", "YTA for sure.

If you are feeling resentful of your boyfriend because he doesn't contribute to your bills then you need to express that he limits his time at your place.

Did you bring up paying rent earlier than you said you did in the post (has it been a continuous conversation or has it been a recent one).? \n\nTo me, this reads like you've been letting him live there rent free (which you did end up saying has to change) and there haven't been many issues. Then he invited his family over, which you agreed to, and he kept his end of the deal as far as preparing dinner and whatnot and you didn't like it. Then you threw the fact that he doesn't pay rent in his face and made a rule that his family can never visit on weekdays. It really sounds like a power play here, and I don't like it one bit. Clearly you've made the place feel like home for him and you used this opportunity to remind him that it's not in a really cruel way. \nIf you have this big of an issue with him as far as rent goes, you gotta talk more about it instead of letting it fester into this.

You have lost sight of the mountains because you're focused on the trees. From what you wrote, I suspect, if you find the courage, take the time, dig deep, and be honest with yourself, you would probably come to the conclusion this relationship has run it's course FOR NOW. That might stink and hurt to hear because you have so much time and emotions invested. But from what you wrote, he isn't in a situation where he can offer you much, albeit he sounds like a nice guy. But being a nice person doesn't mean you are life partner material. In order to be able to lay the foundation for a relationship to be one that lasts happily for years and years - or more healthy than this one currently is- you have to have compatibility, chemistry, and the right timing. Timing is defined by a person being in a good place with family, work, and emotional and mental health. Simply put, you and he aren't even in the same life position (or universe) ; you both aren't equal partners nor does he currently have the emotional or financial resources to become an equal partner. He doesn't bring to the plate anything that brings you both an equal footing and your relationship is out of balance as a result. Thus, the timing of this relationship sounds very very off. I bet that is truly why you were disgruntled and laying \"rules\" for a boyfriend that doesn't truly even live with you!   You, my dear, are in an unhealthy relationship and at a dead end. If you continue this relationship, you do at great risk of creating a power imbalance which is a relationship death sentence.  In addition, there wasn't anything in what you wrote that sounded like why you thought this guy was great for you.  I can't find anything that makes me think that this guy is wonderful or what he does that makes you feel wonderful. There is absolutely no warmth here. Why are you in this relationship?

One does not have to go to college to learn how to live alone, and one going to college doesn\u2019t necessarily learn any of the lessons you suggest are exclusive to college. \nThey also don\u2019t feed themselves if they live in the dorms, and once they move out it\u2019s a dice roll.", "Bingo\n\nIt seems like they moved in together too soon.  They both need time to learn how to be independent adults.", "I am not really aware of US laws, so idk how to comment on that. Where I live, she can kick him out and he can do NOTHING. cannot even go back to get his property... but here is a weird sh*thole so reasonable that not everywhere is like this", "What do you mean by \"make up a story\"? What type of story?", "That's what I'm getting from it. Sounds like OP hates their job and is taking it out on their partner.", "I don't know, maybe the fact that he has a disabled Dad at home & had been acting like a father & carer since he was 14!", "Who talks about legalities? \n\nIf it's going to go the legal way, I doubt someone can force OP to accept unwanted guests.", "SassySavcy is correct for a lot of states in the US. It will depend on the state, but in mine a 30 day notice is required. You also can\u2019t just change locks otherwise it\u2019s an illegal lockout. If they refuse to leave after the 30 days, you have to go through a formal eviction process with the courts.", "If he moves in she has to tell the landlord but that\u2019s about all I know. I think he might have some protections after living there a bit but not as much as he would with a lease.", "Oh okay. So you are confidently speaking about things you actually ~don\u2019t~ know about and are throwing around the term \u201cabusive\u201d to boot.\n\nDunning Kruger Syndrome in full effect.", "Just because he is treating his family with respect doesn't mean he is doing the same for his partner.", "Well, since he lives there the vast majority of the time, and we have her own words to confirm that she allows him to live there, it now is his legal residence, whether or not he's paying any rent, and is now an inhabitant \n\nAnd as one, he has rights too, such as having family over\n\nI don't like it either, eviction lazy bums from my property is difficult because of this, even if they don't pay a cent in rent, or have only a verbal agreement\n\nAnd sadly I've had that exact scenario, and I still couldn't kick them out", "100% correct in the USA. Doesn't matter if your name is on the lease or not. Once the 2nd party establishes residency ie, cohabitate in residence a certain amount of time (3 to 4 weeks usually) or receive mail at the residence.\n\nPeople really need to look this stuff up before deciding to live with another person or letting a friend/relative stay for a few days to \"get back on their feet.\" \n\n'", "Nor do we know he doesn't. \nCaring for a disabled loved one is beyond exhausting, it can drain every single part of you & the financial reward is normally little to nothing. It is an amazing thing to do & it's incredibly rewarding but it's also one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do.
