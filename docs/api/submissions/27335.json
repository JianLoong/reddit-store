I have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for almost a year and a half now. I have never been in a long term relationship before, but he has been in a few. Yet, he never went to college and has been living at home his entire life. \n\n**Side note** before I continue, it\u2019ll help to know that his dad had an accident and suffered from a \u201cbrain anoxia\u201d injury three years ago. He has to help take care of his dad with his mom as well as help raise his 14 year old brother. His dad is now fully disabled. He lost his eye sight and is considered \u201cfull time care.\u201d\n \nAs of now, he\u2019s been living with me 98% of the time and has not helped pay for rent, utilities, or internet. He has bought groceries twice and paid for a lot of little things (light bulbs, toaster, decor, eating out, etc.) I told him it has to change moving forward. Another note to know is that my job is an hour and a half of a commute away. His job is very different as he only commutes 30 minutes. \n\nThis past week, he asked me if it was okay for his family and hometown friend who is in the military come over for dinner. I said I prefer for it to not be on a weekday. But we would be out of town this weekend with my mom and his friend would be leaving on Monday. So a weekday was his only choice. He told me he would cook and have everything ready by the time I got home and I wouldn\u2019t have to do anything. \n\nI came home around 6:45 PM that day and everyone was already there. They actually had been there for almost an hour. They made themselves perfectly comfortable. It made me so mad. So i stayed quiet. I helped serve dinner, I cleaned up the kitchen for everyone, then we all chatted and they left around 8:30. \n\nAs my boyfriend and I went to bed that night, he expressed to me how he didn\u2019t appreciate the way I acted. He even said I was acting like a bitch. I told him, \u201cYou invite YOUR family and YOUR friend into MY apartment that you don\u2019t 100% live in yet, nor have helped pay ANY rent and have the nerve to call me a bitch because I was not in a social mood? The audacity.\u201d I was furious. He apologized soon after, but still stood by what he said. I told him that I didn\u2019t mean to come off that way and I\u2019m sorry you feel that way, but you still had no right.  \n\nI understand he wants me to be close with his family, I do too, but I have my limits. He has a completely different relationship with his parents than I do with mine. So I\u2019m trying to be accommodating and supportive, but like I said, I have my limits. Especially when it comes to my home. \n\nI then proceeded to tell him the next day that it is now a boundary for us that as long as he lives with me in my apartment, family or parents (on both ends) can\u2019t come over on weeknights. If I\u2019m working from home, then we can discuss, but otherwise the answer is no.

You obviously resent that he's not paying rent, but you acknowledge that he's living with you 98% of the time. You should be talking about him paying rent. Instead, you're holding that resent about him not participating in caring for the household against him by being angry about unrelated things. Whether he pays rent or not, *he does live there, by your own admission*. If you're living together--and *you are--*it's not just *your* house anymore. It's both of your home. If you're sharing a home, neither of you get to make unilateral decisions anymore. \n2. You also seem to be holding the difference in your commuting times against him, which is unfair. Your commute isn't his fault. \n3. Unless I'm misunderstanding the story, *you agreed to the visit*. \"I said I prefer for it to not be on a weekday. But we would be out of town this weekend with my mom and his friend would be leaving on Monday. So a weekday was his only choice.\" You would have preferred it not be on a weekday, but that wasn't possible, so it had to be a weekday visit. Given that, it's not fair for you to be *angry* that they visited and \"made themselves comfortable.\" Would it have somehow been better for them to have stood around awkwardly and been *uncomfortable* for some reason? \n4. It sounds like you weren't just quiet, but that you might have been somewhat hostile towards his guests, given that he specifically made a point to bring up that he wasn't happy about how you treated them.\n5. That said: he doesn't get to call you a bitch because you were unhappy. That's not okay partner behavior. \n6. He also needs to step up and contribute to the household. If he's living there, he needs to share in the rent and in the responsibilities that go into caring for a household. \n\nUltimately, this whole situation doesn't actually sound like it's about this specific visit; it sounds like it's a deeper problem in your relationship, and you both need to work on it. Setting boundaries like \"nobody is ever allowed to visit during the weekdays\" isn't really a fair boundary when it's a shared living situation, but absolutely refusing to pay rent or contribute to work/expenses isn't, either. \n\nYou guys need to work this shit out, or you'll be living alone again.", "YTA\n\nBy the way you tell it, your boyfriend asked and you reluctantly agreed because it was the only option. If you didn't want anyone over, you should not have agreed. \n\n>They made themselves perfectly comfortable. It made me so mad.\n\nThis is why I think YTA. What are invited guests supposed to do when they come over? Be uncomfortable? That's shitty logic. I would be more inclined to agree if they were going through your stuff, rearranging shit, etc, but you don't mention any of those things.", "*They made themselves perfectly comfortable*\n\nINFO: This wasn't a surprise, and it turns out you didn't have to do anything to set up the event at least, so why were you so mad?", "INFO: Will this rule change if your SO starts contributing to rent?", "YTA. \n\nYour boyfriend did exactly what he was supposed to do: he asked permission. Guests arrived. He did what a host is supposed to do: he entertained the guests. \n\nFurthermore, and I cannot stress this enough:\n\nWhat you laid down is NOT a boundary. It is a rule. There is a difference. \n\nFinally, if your boyfriend \u201clives with you 98%,\u201d as you\u2019ve indicated, he\u2019s living with you and just visiting his folks. This true *regardless of who is paying the rent*. It\u2019s y\u2019all\u2019s apartment now and you should extend to him the rights and privileges afforded to a SO with whom you live. \n\nIf you\u2019re unwilling to agree to these things, he needs to move out and live somewhere else. But YTA for laying down the law about what will and will not happen in \u201cyour\u201d apartment, especially when he asked first.", "YTA - why on earth were you angry? He said they were coming for dinner and they came for dinner.", "YTA.\n\nYou agreed and then were horrible about it. That's your choice.\n\nBut demanding he's not allowed to have family over during the week should you opt to live together? That's not a boundary that's a demand that you are giving him \\*zero\\* input on.", "YTA\n\nIt was obviously a special occasion given your other commitments. \n\nLife is about seizing the moment and you can't always be rigid for the sake of it. \n\nI was expecting to you to say he was doing this weekly or something. \n\nYour rage is misdirected bc he is not contributing financially. Deal with that instead of being inhospitable to something that has happened once. \n\nPeople like generous people.", "YTA. You agreed to this dinner, and it sounds like all you had to do was put on a friendly face for less than two hours, and you couldn't even do that. Also -- you can't set boundaries on other people, only within yourself.", "Yta so you said yes and then.....got mad that he took it as a yes?    If you didn't want it to happen then say 'no'.  Don't dance around and get mad when he takes you at your word.", "Lol this can't even be real.", "YTA for how you reacted. You agreed to the dinner and you listed zero bad behaviors by him or any guests so it sounds like you regretted your choice and took it out on him. \n\nIf he's going to be paying rent to live with you you cannot unilaterally bar him from having his family over. Once he starts paying he has rights too so this is something you guys really need to figure out", "YTA. Soo...you agreed to the dinner, albeit reluctantly, and then acted liked a petulant child when you came home and saw people there, when you knew they would in fact be at your house?? \n\nIf you were that tired, there are polite ways to excuse yourself. You seem insulted that guests would make themselves at home. That is like..the classic guest line lol....\n\nI get that you were not thrilled about this but your bf asked and was told he could. He did what he asked and you acted nasty. \n\nObviously you resent him living there most of the time and not paying rent. Fair enough. And you aren't a fan of visitors during the week. That is your prerogative. You both obviously have some issues to work out. \n\nHowever, how you handled this was completely inappropriate and I wonder, are you mature enough to be in a relationship? This was more how a spoiled teenager would act.", "Ugh.  The audacity.  You probably told him you want him to feel at home there, too.  \n\nHe's not your employee and you don't get to set corporate policy in your shared home.  You're not the manager here. \n\nHe needs to run, far and fast. Hopefully, he can find someone who enjoys quality time with family.  That's a big value not to share.  YTA", "YTA - you said he could have them over and then you're pissed that he had them over, made dinner, and they dared to \"make themselves comfortable.\" What exactly would you have preferred to walk in on?", "YTA.\n\nGrow up. I\u2019ve been with the same partner for 20 years. Compromises must be made.", "ESH just break up already", "YTA. Maybe a serious relationship where you live together isn\u2019t for you.", "Jesus Christ, YTA.", "N T A with a condition\n\nIf he is not paying for anything towards the house, then he needs to respect your rules.\n\nHe can renegotiate if he ever steps though. If you want him to contribute, you\u2019ll also have to accept that his word and opinions will equal to yours and you can\u2019t be the only one calling the shots anymore by that point. You\u2019ll have to figure out a compromise\n\nEDIT: Actually, now that I\u2019m reading more of your comments, YTA. You overall sound very much like a my way or the highway sort and have no intention of treating him like an equal around the house once he starts controbuting", "YTA. Expect him to not live with you. Based on what you have said it will always be your apartment and he'll just live there, even if he is paying bills, which means he'll have to live by your rules. You agreed to the dinner and still behaved badly. If he's smart he'll stay where he is and retain the freedom to see his family.", "YTA. You already knew that they were gonna be there. If you didn't want company, then you should've said so from the start. Not fussed at him after the fact.", "so they cant come over at all? cause usually people work a 9am-5pm shift. smdh. id leave ur sketch assparagus. YTA. u know his family issues. and its best if he just left to live somewhere else. it is UR place. and it will be a lonely/miserable one.", "The elephant in the room no one is really addressing. You live way too far from your job, you are paying for 2 to live and you have a boyfriend who can never leave his caretaking of his family. Something has got to give. Get a new closer job or break up for now and move closer to your job and save for your future.", ">I then proceeded to tell him the next day that it is now a boundary for us that as long as he lives with me in my apartment, family or parents (on both ends) can\u2019t come over on weeknights. If I\u2019m working from home, then we can discuss, but otherwise the answer is no.\n\nThat's not a boundary.  That's a demand that he gets no input in.  People in relationships don't get to arbitrarily make demands like this without any input into it.  He may not be paying rent yet, he should be or should be soon, but it he's living there with you as a couple, he should get some sort of say in how the home is run.  \n\nYTA", "YTA. You agreed to host the gathering? And then you were angry that guests were there? Unfortunately, I think there was no way your BF could know you didn't want guests at your home *before* you arrived. You didn't use your words. (He did actually manage everything as he said he would, right?) 6:45 P.M. is a late dinner for lots of people So, when were they supposed to arrive? 7:30? 8 P.M.?\n\nAt any rate you behaving rudely to the assembled guests reflects poorly on you. But, if you don't want any more guests during your work week, that is reasonable to say out loud. (No matter that they were HIS family and HIS friend - you agreed they'd be guests in YOUR home. Stop acting like you were amazed to find them there. ***You*** *agreed to it and didn't define your boundaries.)*\n\nBut, there is nothing wrong with you not wanting further guest appearances during the week as you go forward.", "Yes you are. I hope he gets the hell out.", "YTA - I think if you want him to be a paying member of the house, he gets to have a say in guests. \"once a week\" \"not on my busy Tuesday\" or \"out by 830pm\" would be reasonable compromises. Your \"boundary\" is just you being a bit controlling", "Why couldn't they just go out to Cheesecake Factory or Friday's or something?\n\nWhy was it a requirement that he cook in your apartment?  Was it a money issue for the family?", "NTA. He said friend not the whole family. Family could\u2019ve hosted dinner at their place or they all could\u2019ve gone to a restaurant.", "NTA. But why are you living with him in the first place. He\u2019s a mooch.", "NTA For future reference, this is not a \"boyfriend\" this is a \"parasite\" you have moving into your place. Get him out of there before he quits his job or gets fired, and he can become a full-time parasite.", "NTA. I really think you need to move on from this guy.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not ready to live together, that's item number 1.  Item number 2, it's your home and you can act however you want, set boundaries how you want, etc.  For number 3, he was incredibly rude to say that to you, I'm surprised you didn't send him home for the night.\n\nIf the plan is that he's going to be a caregiver to his family you need to consider if that's something you want to deal with.  It's OK to not be alright with it and end the relationship over it, because it sounds like that's the direction this is going.", "I have read lots of comments so far and I feel like additional information is needed: \n1. My boyfriend wants to help pay my bills. He is budgeting right now with his job and side jobs being a commercial electrician, however will start paying next month. \n2. I felt like I was put in a corner about this dinner. If I said no, he would be upset that I didn\u2019t want to spend time with them. But I said yes, and he still got upset. So I felt like I was in a loose loose situation. Seeing a lot of comments, I should have said no and suggested something else (going out, going over to his house, etc.) \n3. That specific work day I had almost a 12 hour day, and I was exhausted. It wasn\u2019t my intention to act \u201cbitchy\u201d or stand off ish, I just was not in a great mood. I did apologize to him for the way I acted and I didn\u2019t mean for it to come off that way. \n4. We want to live together. Originally I was hesitant, but with my family issues, I like having the company and feeling like I have a family of my own with him. Plus, it\u2019s an important step to work several kinks of our relationship and living habits out before we get engaged. Which won\u2019t happen for the next few years. \n5. I don\u2019t want this boundary to be forever. It\u2019s definitely not right nor fair to him or myself. But it\u2019s just until we get used to our jobs more and have a better schedule. Plus we are so exhausted from our work days, I want both of us to have time to relax and rest before the next day. \n\nI appreciate the advice and concern lots of commenters have. I am confident we will come to a compromise that works for the both of us. Even though he doesn\u2019t pay rent or bay any serious bills, he still does so much for me and my apartment right now and I want him to start feeling like this is his home. Like I said, the boundary isn\u2019t forever, just until we have a better \u201cwrap\u201d on our new adult life. Thank you everyone.", "NTA.  You can set whatever boundaries you want for YOUR house.  He doesn't live there, he doesn't pay rent, he doesn't contribute to the household expenses.  Next time he wants to entertain, tell him to do it at HIS parents' house.  He has 0 input on YOUR house.  He's using you.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t let him stay the night anymore. He has a lot of audacity for a mooch", "ESH but you are the primary asshole. However, who is the asshole seems pretty far from the main issue here. \n\n  \nIf he is incapable of paying for himself he is probably not in a place to be in a relationship right now.

End of story. If she wants a say so on what goes on there, then he can start ponying up 50% of all the bills. But here is a word of caution, if he disrespected your place, when he is not paying, and does not live there, how do you think he is going to act if he is living there full-time and paying half of the bills. You are definitely NTA asshole in the situation", "NTA, but make sure he pays you rent and pays his share of the utilities. Frankly, I'm not sure I'd want to live with someone who had the audacity to criticize me after inviting people over on a work night against my wishes.", "NTA\n\nStand your ground, you was clear with the boundaries and he crossed the line.\n\nYour house, your rules.\n\nTake care.", "NTA - your house your rules. why is he living with you and not contributing to the cost of it all.

He contributes NOTHING to your apartment, and sounds like, NOTHING to your relationship.\n\nYou need to rethink this relationship entirely.", "NAH. It sounds like you're frustrated by a few things, but you also never set up ground rules or expectations about living together with your BF. \n\nYou agreed to have people over but were tired and not feeling social. Calling you a B for that isn't okay. \n\nExplain to them that you feel strained from finances and the commute and that you aren't as open with your home as his family may be.

This is reasonable. Even if he's actually there most of the time, he's not paying bills/rent so it's your space and you set the rules.\n\nYou throwing a tantrum AFTER he had cleared a friend visit with you before hand, because they were in your apartment before you got home? That would be a different question. He asked, he made reasonable efforts, and you got angry. I suspect you regret giving him the green light for this, but you did and should have sucked it up for that evening at least. Fine, you know now that this isn't something you can stand, so make a rule about it, but I'm with your BF about how you behaved on the night.", "NTA\n\n\nYou have a right to be annoyed that that they arrived way before you and that had to clean up.

He comes with a dynamic that you aren't used to - he's lived at home, is close to his family, and his family experienced a shattering dynamic in their everyday life - unexpected and huge for all of them. He's taking advantage of you, but is likely also looking for a little bit of respite from his intense family life.", "YTA for sure.

If you are feeling resentful of your boyfriend because he doesn't contribute to your bills then you need to express that he limits his time at your place.

Guest are supposed to feel comfortable!!\n\nIt's fine not to want people over on a weeknight but it isn't fine to be a bad host once you have an agreement and they are there. \n\nYour bf is an asshole because he isn't paying bills but, you don't have to allow him to be practically living there.", "YTA why would you be mad about something you agreed to??", ">I told him that I didn\u2019t mean to come off that way and I\u2019m sorry you feel that way, but you still had no right. \n\nYTA for this BS ass apology. \"I didn't mean to\" your intent means jack shit as compared to the actual outcome \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" is gas lighting and dismissive. Y'all should not live together", "YTA, you resent your BF. Congratulations, the relationship is beyond repair.", "YTA\n\nYou took out your frustration over your boyfriend\u2019s lack of contribution on your guests rather than communicating them calmly with your boyfriend at an appropriate time.", "ESH - Sort out your living arrangements and work out whether you cohabit or he's hanging out in your space. The family visit is a side show.", "ESH - Y T A for being rude, but beyond that, this dude is a seems to be a loser mooch.", "Why do you live so far from your job?", "YTA. You aren't ready to be in a cohabitation situation and pretending otherwise is unfair to your significant other. There's an expression \"piss or get off the pot\" - either have boyfriend move in officially including expenses, or have him go back to occasional visits. You clearly resent his being over all the time and not contributing.", "YTA because you agreed to them being there and then acted mad when they were. \n\nBut....you sound like you don't actually want to live with your boyfriend yet. And I think that's ok! You finally had an opportunity to be on your own, stretch your wings, figure out how you like to run your own household and he crashed the party without even helping to pay the rent. It's up to you, but in your position I'd be asking him to leave, that it's too much too soon.", "YTA and a control freak.", "YTA - simply because your anger was misplaced.  His family did nothing wrong and left by 8:30.  Your BF also asked and you agreed.  The reason you are really angry has nothing to do with his family and everything to do with resenting your BF's lack of financial contribution.", "YTA. And from your comments you probably shouldn\u2019t live with your boyfriend because it seems you want your own space with your own rules and that\u2019s not going to work while living with someone else who pays rent whether he\u2019s on the lease or not", "YTA, have you had that conversation previously and got into agreements about all of these? Doesn\u2019t sound like it.\nYou keep saying \u201cMY HOUSE\u201d when he\u2019s supporting you in a way, and also if you want it to be yours completely then tell him to move out, or stop making comments that can make him feel not welcomed.\nIt\u2019s his family, he took care of everything, it was a one time thing and they were out within 1.5 hours of you being there, and it was pretty early compared to what I\u2019ve heard from other people\u2019s families.\nSeems you\u2019re trying to live by yourself completely and put your own rules, do it then, but if you\u2019re gonna let him live there, then lower your controlling talk and have a civil one where both have a saying.", "YTA - Whenever people add things like \"side note\" my alarm bells go off. Cuz it just feels like you're throwing everything at the wall to make your perspective sounds less like an AH. But you still come off as one. This type of boundary is abusive and controlling.\n\nAsk yourself this: What would you say to a female friend who said her boyfriend made a similar restriction/boundary? I doubt you'd ask for more context so you can understand the boyfriend's side. You'd immediately recognize it for the controlling behavior that it is.", "YTA, it doesn't sound like you've grown into this adult relationship thing yet.", "YTA for your tantrum. So what if you had a long day and commute? That doesn\u2019t give you free reign to be a jerk to others. \n\nGrow up.", "\u201cThey made themselves perfectly comfortable. It made me so mad\u201d\n\nJesus Christ.\n\nESH", "YTA for what was asked although it isn't actually what your post is about.  YTA because you agreed they could come over and then you got bent out of shape when they did and were happy to be there.  What a ridiculous thing to be mad over.  OMG.  The guests were happy and taken care of, how horrible.  YTA also because you seem to be holding a lot of hostility over things that are not his fault (his commute, you saying yes) and things that you have not bothered to discuss with him (rent).  Your behavior makes it seem like you are not ready for any sort of  a relationship.", "ESH. Making rules like that is controlling and will never work. Do, YTA for that. It sounds like you want him to move him and split the bills with you. Have you asked him about it?  And why are you driving 3 hours a day?  Can you move closer to work?", "YTA - I mean, it sounds to me like you\u2019re just not super happy about a lot of things in your relationship right now, and this was just when you hit your max\u2026. Like, if you agreed to this visit, and then you\u2019re mad that the company that was invited over made themselves comfortable? Like, do you hear how that sounds?", "For 6, dude has bought groceries. I don't know what's reasonable for different people as far as partners where they're almost living together but they still have separate living arrangements. \n\nIn my case, it's basically ok for the one paying the rent (or mortgage) to be in charge of all expenses for that domicile. The partner who doesn't \"live\" there paying for stuff is gravy. \n\nWith that in mind, the boyfriend is doing gravy work having bought the groceries those 2 times. \n\nBut again, that's my viewpoint and that varies wildly from couple to couple. It's about communication and that seems to lacking from OP with her expectations not communicated to her BF", "I appreciate your honesty and your detailed comment. We are working it out currently to where he is starting to contribute to rent. He definitely wants to, just trying to figure out the logistics with his income and side jobs. I don\u2019t want to hold anything against him or seem selfish, but I would like for him to acknowledge my commute and my exhaustion after work. Again, thank you.", "YTA - exactly this! Were you expecting them to go to your house and be uncomfortable because you weren\u2019t there yet??? Wtf??? I honestly don\u2019t understand the issue or the logic behind it! How can you write that and not see the AH in you???\n\nYou agreed to it, end of story! The fact that he doesn\u2019t pay rent is irrelevant in this conversation!", "So shocking that the guests that she knew would be there were actually there.", "Yeah, I\u2019m curious about that too. I think NTA as of now but once he starts contributing he will have an equal say and they will need to figure out a compromise", "He will starting paying rent / other costs of the apartment next month, so we will reevaluate when that starts. He\u2019s not on the lease, nor will be until we get engaged or married. So he will just be staying with me and helping with rent and other costs.", "I don\u2019t think I should have been angry like I was, but I had almost a 12 hour day and was exhausted. I just wanted to decompress and relax with my boyfriend, just us, not host. So even though I knew they were there, it still just made me slightly upset.", "I think its a demand she can make because he doesn't actually live there at this point. He lives elsewhere and he is needed elsewhere. They haven't blended households. So, I think OP was wrong in expecting her BF to \"know\" what she hadn't previously said? (That she didn't want guests before she arrived back home because she'd have no time or space to come down from her work day and long commute.) \n\nBut, its fine to tell a person who comes and goes from your apartment that they don't have equal rights of access. He doesn't live there officially? Nothing is 50/50 at this point?", "Nah it feels pretty real to me. Both the total lack of self awareness and the fact that this is not hitting any of the key phrases that AITA bots love like \"Step sibling\" \"naming my child\" or \"now mom is guilt tripping me\"", "I support this.\n\nYou pay - your rules.", "Some people prefer cooking for others. It's not always about money.", "Did disabled dad come along to dinner? Because I can see how being in a familiar controlled environment could be better for the caretakers and the dad in that case.", "He currently is a part time caregiver for his dad, while he works full time. His mom is the full time caregiver. I want them to come over and enjoy this space and get out when need be, it is just hard for me on a weeknight after work when I\u2019ve had such a long day. However, we are discussing our options and he is starting to help pay my bills next month.", "It isn\u2019t a boundary.  It\u2019s you unilaterally making up rules and deciding when to change the rules.", "A compromise would be him getting to have people over once a week on a weekday, you seem to want it to be your way and labeled as a \u201ccompromise\u201d. I hope your boyfriend runs far away from your controlling self.", "> with my family issues, I like having the company and feeling like I have a family of my own with him\n\nIf I\u2019m reading this right, it sounds like you want to isolate him from his family out of a perverse sense of fairness, since you\u2019re isolated from yours.\n\nThat fucking sucks. It would suck even if he wasn\u2019t doing caregiving. You can\u2019t cut your partner off from his other important relationships out of jealousy or possessiveness. Go to therapy and learn to manage your grief for your own family issues in a way that isn\u2019t wildly unfair to him.", "When he moves in and its established that this is his residence too, then he can expect equal treatment.", "No lines were crossed, the boundary was put in after the family visited.", "You might want to read it again. OP agreed to the dinner and then after the dinner made the rule. \nThe SO tried (was) to be considerate of the fact it is OPs apartment by asking permission.", "OP agreed to have the friends their on the weekday, and new they would be coming over for dinner that night", "He literally asked and got permission though", "We have entirely different family\u2019s and different relationships with our family\u2019s. It\u2019s definitely something that we have to work through. We want to live together, so it\u2019s just going to take patience and proper communication.", "You sound fun.", "If you're living somewhere 98% of the time, you're living there and should be sharing in the expenses. That's not gravy, at that point. Unless she means something different than I understand, it sounds like her place is his main home, and he sometimes stays at his family's place to help care for his dad, but it sounds like he's living at her place, sleeping there, having meals there, etc. If he wasn't, why is he inviting people to come have dinner there as though it's his place? Paying for groceries twice in a place you're living 98% of the time isn't really equitable. They don't seem to have separate living arrangements; he doesn't have his own place, from the sound of it, at least.", "I think that there are compromises to be made. If he's having people over *every night* that's a problem, but it doesn't sound, from your post, like that's the situation. \n\n\"My commute leaves me pretty exhausted by the time I get home, so you can have people over, but I'm going to need a bit of time to myself after work to get myself prepared for socializing; I'll say hi, but won't be joining until I've had a bath and some time to myself\" for example. Or an agreement where you might have guests once a week but if he wants to see people more often than that, it has to be somewhere else. Or an agreement where if he has guests over, *he does all of the cleaning* afterward while you decompress. \n\nThere are other options besides you pulling the \"this is my apartment, so it's my rules 100%\" card, is all I'm saying. When you're partners, these kinds of situations require discussion, not dictates.", "You are so young to be so resentful in your relationship.  It doesn't seem like anything is going to change soon - your boyfriend has very long term commitments to his family and a low income.  It is ok to leave if you aren't happy with the situation.\n\nI think you should move to be closer to your work.  The relationship will work out or not work out but you will be a lot less stressed.  He isn't ready to be living with you if something super basic like rent needs so much figuring out.", "I don't understand when you thought dinner was going to be served 8:00 at night?", "Based on what OP provided as info, there will be likely no compromise. YTA from me.", "You are not really open to the idea that even if he shares rent/col he can enjoy the living space the way he wants? As in, your name is on the lease and regardless of what he pays he\u2019s just existing in your space? \n\nThat\u2019s what i got from your response.\n\nPlease clarify but im definitely getting the \u201cMaybe really means no\u201d vibe.", "Whoa!  You guys are so far from being ready for engaged or married.  I honestly think you'd be better off living separate for awhile.  You're both young and need to learn your independence.  This is what worries me with your bf:\n>he never went to college and has been living at home his entire life  \n\nHe is missing a lot of life skills.  Anytime someone jumps from parents house right into SOs house it is a recipe for trouble.", "Look, this dude is going to have a transitional period of going from home to full adult responsibilities\n\nAnd frankly you don\u2019t seem equipped with one iota of the patience or grace required to navigate that.", "\u201cRe-evaluate\u201d lol\n\nI am kind of on your side.

Or maybe you are stressed out because of your work. \n\nHope you will figure it out and improve your life satisfaction.", "You two shouldn't even be living together much less worrying about getting engaged or married. Neither of you is anywhere mature enough for this step in your relationship. This isn't just on your boyfriend. You need to learn how to communicate and compromise. \n\nAnd as far as demanding no weeknight visits and you will re-evaluate once he pays bills like you are somehow the queen of the apartment, if he values family as much as it seems, you will lose every time.", "But you had talked about it in advance and he thought it was fine.

Sure, set limits on the use of your time and space when you\u2019re exhausted, but it looks a little bit like you\u2019re trying to generally scale back his family contact purely because it\u2019s foreign to you.
