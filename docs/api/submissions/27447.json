She had been sick for a really long time. I (17m) was close to her because she and my dad were very close when he was a kid and she was the grandma who helped take care of the grandkids while the parents worked. My dad always said she was the greatest person. He died when I was 8 and our relationship was extra special after his loss.\n\nMy parents were separated when my dad died and mom had sort of moved on already. Two years later she moved in her now husband and my stepsister who is 5 years younger than me.\n\nMy paternal family never invited my stepsister along to things and only some have met her in passing. My great grandma never met or spoke to her and there was zero relationship between them. \n\nWhen great grandma died she left all the family something. I got my great grandpa's watch that she had some work done on to make it work and look a bit more modern for today. Of course this was done before she died. The watch had her and great grandpa's initials and he wore it every day until his death. I also got some photos of hers and a blanket she had made for my dad that everyone agreed I should have.\n\nMy stepsister asked a few days after I got the stuff why she never got anything. My mom and her dad were like I'm sure there are some things. Mom even called my grandma to ask about something for my stepsister and grandma told her only family were left or entitled to great grandma's things.\n\nMy mom was trying to tell my stepsister that she should have gotten something and they would figure it out. My stepsister asked me and suggested we share the photos and blanket. I told her no and said she didn't get anything from great grandma because they never met or had any relationship. I told her she was my dad's grandma, not my mom's, and they were not family.\n\nMy stepsister was still upset and started to cry. She asked why I have a whole other family that she doesn't and why don't they want to include her. She is autistic and doesn't always understand social things. She's also had an interest in being around my paternal family in the past.\n\nMy mom told me it was disgusting to say those things to her and I should be ashamed for upsetting her and making her feel unworthy. She also told me she was ashamed of how flippant I was about my \"little sister\" being left out.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695466834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16q1lh5/aita_for_telling_my_stepsister_she_didnt_get/", "score": 3712, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ask Gma if she has either something sitting around that looks like it has value like a tchotchke (I didn't know how this was spelled except for autocorrect) or a pocketknife he may have bought at a garage sale last year that could  look like it had sentimental value,  or an old wallet that they didn't throw away or are going to; and then maybe tell of some story of how it was of sentimental value to Gpa if you can easily think of how you remember him having it when..... and she can have it to have a little piece of Gpa. Just anything Gma may not have no real attachment to. If i is an old wallet maybe tuck a dime inside as a surprise.

I bet stepsis  will value this more than money.", "I deem it important to include everyone into a family. It is not some distant cousin, you are talking about.
