She had been sick for a really long time. I (17m) was close to her because she and my dad were very close when he was a kid and she was the grandma who helped take care of the grandkids while the parents worked. My dad always said she was the greatest person. He died when I was 8 and our relationship was extra special after his loss.\n\nMy parents were separated when my dad died and mom had sort of moved on already. Two years later she moved in her now husband and my stepsister who is 5 years younger than me.\n\nMy paternal family never invited my stepsister along to things and only some have met her in passing. My great grandma never met or spoke to her and there was zero relationship between them. \n\nWhen great grandma died she left all the family something. I got my great grandpa's watch that she had some work done on to make it work and look a bit more modern for today. Of course this was done before she died. The watch had her and great grandpa's initials and he wore it every day until his death. I also got some photos of hers and a blanket she had made for my dad that everyone agreed I should have.\n\nMy stepsister asked a few days after I got the stuff why she never got anything. My mom and her dad were like I'm sure there are some things. Mom even called my grandma to ask about something for my stepsister and grandma told her only family were left or entitled to great grandma's things.\n\nMy mom was trying to tell my stepsister that she should have gotten something and they would figure it out. My stepsister asked me and suggested we share the photos and blanket. I told her no and said she didn't get anything from great grandma because they never met or had any relationship. I told her she was my dad's grandma, not my mom's, and they were not family.\n\nMy stepsister was still upset and started to cry. She asked why I have a whole other family that she doesn't and why don't they want to include her. She is autistic and doesn't always understand social things. She's also had an interest in being around my paternal family in the past.\n\nMy mom told me it was disgusting to say those things to her and I should be ashamed for upsetting her and making her feel unworthy. She also told me she was ashamed of how flippant I was about my \"little sister\" being left out.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695466834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16q1lh5/aita_for_telling_my_stepsister_she_didnt_get/", "score": 351, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just anything Gma may not have no real attachment to. If i is an old wallet maybe tuck a dime inside as a surprise.

What she is, is a kid who relies on her parents a little more than normal to tell her how the world works - and instead of giving her that help by explaining that both kids have parts of the family that aren't shared in common and that's ok, Mom is trying to sell her a simplified delusion because it's easier.", "There is nothing indicating the sister is a spoiled sibling though.", "So how is op TA??", "She was never in my paternal family. They have never made her part of the family.", "Great-grandma is from the other side of OP's family though- so no relation to his stepsister. Great-grandma has no obligation to leave OP's stepsister even a tiny token.\n\nOP could have said it in a nicer way maybe, but it's not his responsibility to explain it to his stepsister.\n\nNTA.", "What just because she is autistic doesn\u2019t mean she is entitled to something from op father\u2019s family. Op dad died hadnt even met op stepsister, so why would she get something from his family? \n\nEdit to add nta your mom and step-dad should have explained the family dynamic to her and not promise her something from your dad\u2019s family.", ">It is not some distant cousin, you are talking about\n\nNo, a cousin would be family. It's a stepsister. \n\n>YTA (or rather your grandma, who wasn't considerate enough to avoid the whole thing with a tiny token)\n\nIn what universe is she the asshole for not leaving something to her deceased grandson's ex wife's new stepdaughter whom she never met?? Are you for real?? \n\n>She is either in or out, and if she is in, she needs to be in entirely.\n\nShe is out. Especially in his dad's family, where she isn't even a step relative.", "Maybe the mother should do that.", "This actually makes the most logical sense, unless sister expects OP to spend time with that side of the family or they have zero relationship. At 12 though,  it's not complicated to understand,  but a very emotional one. This may also be their first experience with death. There's so many factors. The AH though,  is your mom, for encouraging this.", "She's an autistic 12 year old, it's okay to treat her with kid gloves. She may not understand social norms as readily as other kids. Her mom is the one at fault for encouraging the entitlement instead of helping her understand norms.", "Return", "This, exactly. Attacking a 12-year-old autistic girl who needs help and isn't getting it from her parents - that's not right.  \n\n\nOP is NTA.  Nor is his sister. Nor should his sister be getting any part of what he inherited from his great-grandmother, who was no relation to her.", "She\u2019s complaining about not inheriting something from someone she never met. She\u2019s spoiled.", "Except the fact that she cried that some unknown lady didn't leave her anything.", "Agreed. Besides having autism we don't know how old she is.", "The way OP phrased the fact that her step sister wasn't part of the family while knowing she was upset and doesn't understand social situations seems a little harsh to me.\n\nI don't think OPs stepsister was acting entitled, she wanted to share pictures of someone she never met. This tells me that OPs stepsister mind is extremely fragile, and the confrontation should have been handled with great care.\n\nThe fact that OP is aware that their stepsister is autistic and doesn't understand social situations just that everyone could have handled everything a little better.", "She is your sister, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They have never made her part of the family.\n\nNo. Apparently they haven't.", "I never said entitled.", "In what sad universe is a stepsister not a sister?\n\n(The grandmother is still alive, administering the inheritance, knows the stepsister, and can already make an informed decision about whether to make a young autistic person feel like they belong. Or whether to act like an uncaring a\\*\\*\\*\\*. The grandmother made that choice, apparently ousting the kid, hence: a\\*\\*\\*\\*)", "Sure, because the mom totally didn't reinforce the idea step sis should get something.", "And OP, I'm sorry for your loss.", "I didn't blame the autistic 12 year old. Criticising the velvet glove treatment is essentially calling out the Mom for not explaining this to her in a black and white way.", "yeah, the mom needs to explain this instead of making it seem everyone is entitled to other people's stuff. someone should explain the difference between sentimental items and regular every day stuff you would buy at Walmart", "You know nothing about autism, right?", "She is 12.\n\n17-5=12", "She's 12", "No, she is a step sister which means she has zero relationship with OP's dad's family and should never have been encouraged to expect one.", "Why would they?", "Stepsister, not sister. We are not biologically related at all and she has never been part of my dad's side. My mom is her stepmom so her side would be related through marriage.", "You didn\u2019t say the word entitled but you did say she should have gotten something from a family that she is not a part of.", "OPs paternal family didn\u2019t \u2018oust\u2019 her bc she isn\u2019t part of their side of the family and have no relationship with her at all. The items OP received sound highly sentimental- things his own deceased father owned. Why in the world should the grandmother give away possessions from a family to which the stepsister has no connection?", "Autism is not an excuse for acting entitled. The kid is 12, but old enough to understand that someone she'd never met doesn't have to give her everything. But granted, the biggest fault belongs to op's mom and stepdad for encouraging entitled behaviour.", "Which is something completely different than being entitled.", "I figured as much.", "I\u2019m confused per Merriam-Webster entitled means  having a right to certain benefits or privileges. You believing she should get a gift from family she doesn\u2019t belong to.", "But in any case op mom and step dad being unwilling to explain the family dynamics and explain to stepsister why she doesn\u2019t have a right to inherit something from op\u2019s dad family to avoid her crying is creating an entitled person."]}
