I feel like your wife is wrong in how she reacted but I also feel that the tone of your writing almost sounds like you are punishing her for having to work and spend less time with your son but she works so you have the privilege to be a stay at home dad. And I also feel that you allowed your 4yr old to control the situation. To me, I feel if you can make a costume for your friend, why couldn't you have made a simple one on the side for your wife so she wouldn't have felt left out? After all, she's busy working to provide for your family. \n\nNEED INFO: You're a stay at home dad, are you providing any financial support as well with a small job at home or does that responsibility fall solely on your wife?

Imagine the hurt your boy will carry. And your wife as well. Just compare with the countless men a generation or two back who basically had no relationship with their kids (my dad included). It can still be mended. And number two, you and your wife need to sit down and talk. Communicate. You\u2019re not a mind reader. Nor is she. You can apologise for not including her (also let her know boyo was asked and declined her company). She might want to apologise for miscommunicating and assuming you\u2019d know what she meant.

My son said he only wanted to go trick or treating with daddy and Best Friend.\n\nOP, in my humble opinion, you shouldn't even have asked your son. The person you should have asked was your wife in private and encouraged your wife to make more time for your kid. You should have made a costume for your wife based on the characters your kid likes and explained to him that it would be fun to go as a family.

They have such a sweet bond, and have since my son was born. I asked Best Friend if he wanted to join us trick or treating, and he immediately agreed.\n\nYour kid's attachment to best friend means that the latter spends too much with you guys. What's up with that? You asked him to join you and he agreed immediately? Did he ask you to make him a costume? Does best friend not have his own family? Is he gay? Are you attracted to him? Are you two attracted to one another?\n\nSeems like you are already looking for excuses to leave your wife. Did you even ask your wife to join in the same manner you did with best friend? Her arguing with you means she expected to join her family but you had already excluded her by not making a costume for her. Then you go on to say in a comment that she could have joined you even without a costume if she really wanted to? What?

She really would have looked ridiculous no matter how much she works if she had gone out with her family and a friend who were all dressed up as a theme that you spent hours on and she had nothing.  If I\u2019m flipping the roles and she\u2019s the stay at home parent and she\u2019s included her brother or any other adult in a family costume it would be just as odd if you weren\u2019t included.  She wanted you to make a costume for her, she wanted you to discuss with your kid why this wasn\u2019t ok to exclude her.  She\u2019s an adult who could have talked to you about this, but a family costume with a best friend and not mom no matter how close they are is telling your wife the kid likes best friend more than mom and you\u2019re ok with this is which is why she\u2019s mad.", "YTA.\n\nYOU DO NOT LET A 4 YEAR OLD DECIDE WHO IS INCLUDED IN FAMILY ACTIVITIES!!!!!\n\nYou are the adult in charge and you should have made sure to include your wife.

No wonder your kid loves your friend- he is there when your son asks him to be, while your wife rarely is. Take it from a career-driven military vet mom of four whose husband was a SAHD - she can be a lot more involved and a lot more mentally engaged than she is. She is choosing to phone it in on her son, and maybe it\u2019s time to have a heart-to-heart with her on whether she wants a relationship with him or not, because it\u2019s her choices that will determine that.

Over the course of the next month, I would casually bring it up again to my son and he continually gave the same answer. My wife was clearly hurt but would always brush it off.\n\nWell that makes sense- she isn't around. You said she *could* lessen her hours but prefers worklife over homelife. She made a decision and this is the obvious outcome\n\n>Fast forward to Halloween night. I had spent weeks working on these little costumes for all of us. As we were getting ready, my wife and I got into a big argument over the fact that she didn\u2019t have a costume. I pointed out that if she had wanted me to make her one, she could have requested I do so, or she could have gotten one for herself. She said it was ridiculous that the three of us were doing a matching theme and leaving her out of it, and that she wasn\u2019t even going\n\nSo in three weeks she was somehow incapable of involving herself in her family's life, so much so that she couldn't have bought her own costume, asked you to make her one, or made one herself? She had 21 days and couldnt do any of those things? And then choses to yell at you on halloween because of her choices?\n\n>She said it was ridiculous that the three of us were doing a matching theme and leaving her out of it, and that she wasn\u2019t even going.\n\nWhat's ridiculous is that she somehow wants to ignore her family when its convenient to her but then expects to also be included last minute when she made zero effort to be apart of this special holiday you planned out for your son? Give me a break. She really was about to ruin her child'a halloween over her decision to not he involved.\n\n>my wife still isn\u2019t speaking to me because she \u201ccan\u2019t believe I actually went without her.\u201d\u00a0\n\nYour wife is being childish, she needs to get a grip and highlight her priorities.

She wasn't allowed an additional break to take care of herself and she just kept working because she felt that's how she was most useful to baby and dad, and she felt weird, like she wasn't being a \"real\" mom because the kid seemed like such a daddy's girl for years.\n\nShe was also suffering from postpartum, and had very big feelings toward her kid (as one does) because this kid she was supposed to love so much (and is supposed to love her) hurt her very badly (physically, during the birth - birth is a violent and traumatic experience for all involved and expecting moms not to have some mixed emotions about being literally used as an incubator and ripped open by this baby is just not realistic).\n\nLuckily they (mom and dad) worked on communication and ways that they could support each other in making sure mom was able to connect or recharge enough of her battery that was was able to spend more time with them. Over time they managed her postpartum and trauma, their expectations, and found ways for her to reconnect with their child in a way she had never been able to previously. Now the kid is attached to them both and everyone's doing stellar.\n\nAll that to say, relationships are very nuanced and the kid (who has no real life experience when it comes to understanding nuance or being emotionally intelligent) shouldn't be calling the shots.
