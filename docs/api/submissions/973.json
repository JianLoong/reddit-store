As Halloween approached this year, my son let me know that he wanted to dress up as characters from his favorite show at the moment. These aren\u2019t costumes that are readily available to buy, so I was going to have to do some crafting magic and make them.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m a stay at home father and my wife is something of a workaholic. She could cut down on her hours if she wished, but she\u2019s always been a very work driven/focused person. She\u2019s not very maternal. Because of this, my son has never been very attached to her. They have time together at dinner, but even during times when my wife is off work (like during bath time and bed time) it\u2019s always just me. This isn\u2019t me complaining; I signed on for the SAHD life and I enjoy every minute of it. I just wish, for his sake, that she would be more involved.\n\nAbout a month before Halloween, my son asked if my best friend (35m) could dress up with us. He had already assigned himself and me a specific character and I had started work on the costumes, so I figured it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to add one more. He ADORES Best Friend. They have such a sweet bond, and have since my son was born. I asked Best Friend if he wanted to join us trick or treating, and he immediately agreed.\n\nDuring dinner the night following this, I asked him what character he wanted his mom to be. My son said he only wanted to go trick or treating with daddy and Best Friend. Over the course of the next month, I would casually bring it up again to my son and he continually gave the same answer. My wife was clearly hurt but would always brush it off.\n\nFast forward to Halloween night. I had spent weeks working on these little costumes for all of us. As we were getting ready, my wife and I got into a big argument over the fact that she didn\u2019t have a costume. I pointed out that if she had wanted me to make her one, she could have requested I do so, or she could have gotten one for herself. She said it was ridiculous that the three of us were doing a matching theme and leaving her out of it, and that she wasn\u2019t even going.\n\nIn the end, Best Friend and I took him trick or treating alone and my wife still isn\u2019t speaking to me because she \u201ccan\u2019t believe I actually went without her.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667431370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yklhhj/aita_for_taking_our_son_trick_or_treating_without/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not sure what stopped her\u2026 and so I\u2019m not sure what she\u2019s complaining about.", "ESH. She\u2019s acting ridiculous because you were planning this openly and she never picked a character herself in the conversations, nor did she get her own costume, or even walk along to enjoy watching. You\u2019re acting like her working a lot means that she doesn\u2019t deserve to be consciously included in activities when she is able to be with the family, and that probably feels pretty awful.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to allow your 4yo the authority to ostracize his mom on your behalf. If you\u2019d just made her a costume, I\u2019ll bet he would have been over the moon once he saw her in it and matching his theme.", "NTA\n\nIf she wanted to be involved, it sounds like she had numerous opportunities to show interest in being involved. Hopefully, she will take this as a wakeup call that her lack of involvement is having an actual effect on both her life and the life of her child. \n\nDo not apologize. Remind her that she can be exactly as involved as she makes an effort to be, but that your son is already showing signs of not wanting her around, and that this isn't going to get better if she doesn't do something.", "What was the point of building the art studio if you're not going to make group costumes for your perfect family. \n\nThat lady you mentioned though, she sounds annoying.", "It would be great if wife was more involved with your son. \n\nIt would have been nice if she had expressed a definite interest in participating so you would have had a costume ready for her.\n\nWhen you were planning it, perhaps it would have been a good parenting moment to remind your son that being left out of the fun can hurt people\u2019s feelings and there was no reason to exclude mom.\n\nYou mentioned it would be nice if she was more involved with your son. Maybe she needs a little help feeling wanted since you and your son have already figured out your style of interaction and hers might be a little different but she doesn\u2019t know what it is yet. Maybe doing things together with her but being careful to make sure she doesn\u2019t feel like a third wheel would be a start if part of the problem is her not knowing how to connect with him.\n\nI just worry that there is a disconnect because she is gone for too many hours, and then the lack of connection makes her work more to cover and hide being hurt. And what might otherwise have been fixed remains forever broken.\n\nOf course, I could be totally misreading the situation. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc", "This is sad, but no, you\u2019re NTA.

She also needs to learn how to express hurt emotions rather than \u2018brushing them off\u2019 or just not participating. \n\nAnd you need to learn how to communicate with her and support her as part of the family, rather than shooting out passive aggressive commentary and further encouraging the \u2018us vs. Mom\u2019 mentality. \n\nYour son excluding her was his way of expressing his pain over being ignored. He\u2019s 4 and doesn\u2019t know how else to express it. You\u2019re an adult and can use your words, yet you choose to encourage the isolating of mom instead of saying, \u2018Mommy is going to be here for trick or treating, let\u2019s make it fun!\u2019 \n\nIt speaks VOLUMES that you spent weeks working on costumes \u2018for all of us\u2019 but didn\u2019t do anything for your wife. She probably didn\u2019t go because she felt isolated with no costume, while you, best friend, and son look like a family unit.", "I would really like to hear Mom's side of this story.", "NTA. You gave her lots of opportunities to engage and participate.", "I have to go with YTA. I'm halfway waiting for the update where you turn the guest room into an art studio for the best friend without discussing it with your wife.", "NTA. Now she knows what she's missing out on. The person she hurt by working so much  is her son. I think she's more mad at herself than she is with you.", "I'm torn with this one. I feel like your wife is wrong in how she reacted but I also feel that the tone of your writing almost sounds like you are punishing her for having to work and spend less time with your son but she works so you have the privilege to be a stay at home dad. And I also feel that you allowed your 4yr old to control the situation. To me, I feel if you can make a costume for your friend, why couldn't you have made a simple one on the side for your wife so she wouldn't have felt left out? After all, she's busy working to provide for your family. \n\nNEED INFO: You're a stay at home dad, are you providing any financial support as well with a small job at home or does that responsibility fall solely on your wife? And how many hours does she work? How much money?  Does she have a crappy paid job that forces her to need to work more hours or she just wants peace of mind to be financially stable?", "Info: couldn\u2019t she have joined even without a costume?\n\nEdit: NTA.", "Info: why is your wife more concerned with being included than being liked by her own son?", "Your attitude towards your wife vs best friend is weird. You make a costume for your friend to join trick-or-treating but not your wife? It\u2019s almost like you are punishing her for working long hours. YTA.", "NTA, it's not like you did this without her knowledge. You spoke about it multiple times. She should have told you and son she wanted to join.", "NTA - she said \u201cshe wasn\u2019t even going\u201d. Two things, if she doesn\u2019t take this as a signal that she needs to spent more time with your son, she\u2019s not really going to have a relationship with him. He\u2019s not going to want to. Imagine the hurt your boy will carry. And your wife as well. Just compare with the countless men a generation or two back who basically had no relationship with their kids (my dad included). It can still be mended. And number two, you and your wife need to sit down and talk. Communicate. You\u2019re not a mind reader. Nor is she. You can apologise for not including her (also let her know boyo was asked and declined her company). She might want to apologise for miscommunicating and assuming you\u2019d know what she meant. And she might want to apologise to boyo for not being involved and change that. Otherwise you\u2019ll have more of the same in the future.", "NTA. I really feel for your little boy. Your story reminds me of cat\u2019s in the cradle, where the dad doesn\u2019t have time for his son and his son grows up and has no time for him. \n\nI\u2019m a mother and I work outside the home. It\u2019s not about her career. It\u2019s the fact that she comes home and doesn\u2019t make time for him. Of course he\u2019s not going to suddenly want to be close because it\u2019s Halloween. He\u2019s protecting himself", "INFO - why did you let your 4 year old exclude mom and kind of just roll with it?  Especially since you say that she was clearly hurt by it and also that you wish they had a stronger bond. \n\nNot making a judgment yet - just looking for more clarification on your thought process when he said he didn't want her coming. Not down playing that she needs to make an effort cause she obviously does.", "Or maybe she could have expressed herself and wishes. She doesn't get a pass because she's a mom that works and he's a sahd. If this were the other way around op would be getting bashed right and left. The fact the 4 year old said what his wishes were in front of mom should have been an oh shit moment, let me get my act together. It wasn't and she doubled down on it. Op is NTA.", "I\u2019m reading it exactly the same way. Cycles of very slight offense or miscommunication layering to gradually create bigger rifts.", "Could I get some context?", "Wait wait wait. If the wife was a sahm, you wouldn't be questioning whether she provides financial support so don't question dad because he chooses to be there for his child.", "She could have. It was her choice to stay behind.", "Image probably. Maybe she thinks her looking like someone who does family stuff will help how she presents herself.", "How is he a AH? The mom barely makes time for her kid. Although you do have a slight point with the best friend, idk if YTA is justified here respectfully.", "The kid requested this, not like OP just did it without reason.", "I've tried to be understanding - sometimes people just don't have that pull to kids or to being parents. He was a surprise for us, so to an extent I get it. Still, I adore being a dad. She clearly hasn't found her rhythm with parenthood like I have. I've done my very best to surround him with people who love him and who are hands-on with him(myself, Best Friend, my parents and siblings) and am hoping she gets more into helping out when he gets older.", "I tried to suggest it to him that we include her in the costume. Like I said, I gently brought it up to him a few times over the course of the month. But pushing him into something he doesn't want isn't going to facilitate bonding, it will just put a damper on Halloween for him.", "Its regarding another post, if you don't know, don't worry. It's getting old, and has no impact on your post.", "I still would. I, myself am a stay at home mom so the whole time I wrote my reply I was thinking would I feel the same way if things were reversed and yes, I would still be asking those questions to get the whole picture. I also grew up in a home where my dad was the stay at home spouse. So I really did not intend for my comment to come off the way you are thinking :(", "You\u2019re NTA but you guys need to address the fact that your son doesn\u2019t like to spend time with his mother. Or this situation is gonna become a nightmare.", "NTA (for a vote), but I feel very sorry for your son. I hope someday you and her can have a calm conversation with good active listening to move past this and onto the bigger issue of image vs care. (Edited wrong wording)", "If this comes up again next year, after your son requests this for him, & that for you & BF, ask him what should Mommy be.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you as the adult were excluding her but maybe if you had nudged your son to include her & she heard it from his mouth, she might have played along.", "That sounds really tough for everyone. But when it\u2019s one\u2019s own child it\u2019s not \u201chelping out\u201d. It\u2019s just parenting", "Um... he's four and fickle.  Include her anyway.  Give her the chance and make it clear that you want her there... that'll make all the difference in his opinion.", "Gotcha. That makes sense. Thanks for clarifying  NTA - hopefully she gets it together and she doesnt grow older and end up with a \"Cats In The Cradle\" type of situation when hes an adult.\n\nMy husband is the workaholic in our marriage but he definitely makes an effort. It can surely be done. There has to be balance and you cannot do it for her."]}
