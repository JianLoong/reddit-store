{"id": 17648, "submission_id": "13lx9hf", "title": "AITA for telling my neighbor his wife and kids need to stay inside if they're scared of birds?", "selftext": "Ok, for context I am 32m, my wife is 29f, and our neighbors are a husband and a wife somewhere in their late 30s if I had to guess. They have two kids who are 10 and 12, both boys. \n\nWe have a pretty cordial relationship with the neighbors. We aren't friends but we chat from time to time about the weather or our families if we're both outside at the same time. Our yards are side by side with no fences and our houses are pretty close to each other (maybe about 15-20 feet between the two).\n\nWell, my wife and I have been really struggling with fertility. It's been hard on us both but it's hitting my wife really, really hard. She recently got into bird watching as a way to distract herself I think. As part of this she bought 2 bird feeders and a birdhouse to bring the birds to our yard. She sits out there and works (she WFH) sometimes and goes out and enjoys her morning coffee looking at the birds. It might sound goofy but it makes my wife smile so I'm all for it. \n\nNeedless to say since my wife has been feeding the birds there are more birds coming to the yard. I hadn't really thought much of it other than learning about types of birds when my wife brings it up. But my neighbor, we'll call him Todd, stopped me yesterday as I was getting out of my car to go inside to ask me if my wife and I could get rid of the birdfeeders. He said his wife and kids were terrified of birds and since they are coming to our yard they are coming into his yard, too. I told him that my wife and I were going through a lot and that the birds were really putting a smile on his face. I said \"I'll move the feeders to the other side of the yard, that should help, ok?\" and went to walk inside. \n\nHe grabbed my arm and said no, that wasn't good enough. we went back and forth a little and he was raising his voice, which I think is why my wife came out on the porch. I told him to let me go and that he needed to calm down. He then proceeded to say \"you don't have kids or you wouldn't be a dick about this. why would you want to make little kids cry?\". My wife immediately went inside (when i came in she was crying). I looked at Todd and told him that he was an ass and that he had no idea how hurtful what he just said was. I told him if the birds made my wife smile then they were here to stay and that if his wife and kids were that terrified of birds they should probably just stay inside. \n\nIn my mind I'm justified. They are BIRDS. It's not like my wife is playing Snow White and summoning raccoons, deer, or other major pests to our yards. It's also not like the yard is covered in birds. There's just some more than usual.

If anything, parents all over make batshit crazy arguments under the guise of protecting their kids, case in point. \n\nIf I put myself in his shoes, I can see that he cares about his family in the same way that you care about your wife. He wants them to be happy and safe, just like you do for your wife. But at the end of the day... They're birds. Objectively, birds are harmless (assuming you're not luring vultures or something). He crossed the line, move the bird feeders a little away from his yard and call it a day. Good luck to you and your wife.", "NTA, at all.

It's incredulous to me that someone would ask you to remove bird feeders. I assume the birds aren't attacking anyone so apparently his wife and kids don't like seeing birds. That's  just ridiculous.

The wife might be,  but she's projecting that onto the kids.", "NTA. Those poor kids would have been teased so mercilessly when I was in elementary school. They're BIRDS.

They\u2019re out to get us!!\u201d I\u2019m picturing this entire family running around the yard with umbrellas over their heads screaming at songbirds. \n\nWTF... we\u2019re moving.\n\neta", "The wife definitely taught the kids to be scared of birds.  OP needs to (truthfully) tell the kids that birds are tiny dinosaurs and the kids will start loving them.", "I\u2019m afraid of birds thanks to watching The Birds in 9th grade English. However, it\u2019s really just swarms of them, and the Canada Goose. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to stay away from them, especially since op offered to move the bird feeder.", "This is blatant misinformation.  \n\nr/BirdsArentReal", "LOL - my daughter had to do a \"hyperbole speech\" in high school, and it was all about how birds are all robots that secretly record people. \ud83d\udc26 The really funny part though, she used the Audubon Society site as one of her references because she didn't know what it actually was.", "The only birds I could see issue with are swans/geese that aren't properly (confined? Not roaming) they are terrifying, and I wouldn't mess with them, lol. It's not the case here, though. Maybe it's best if his wife and kids talk to a therapist about their fears if it's that bad. Mostly the wife, depending on the age of the kids.", "Yes they do, and they laugh, and then they put a toy bird in Timmy's desk desk and laugh again when he screams.", "LoL I don't think advising vandalism is the best thing here \ud83e\udd23", "It's bird feeders. It's really not that deep", "Omg hahaha", "I'm sure the birds will find somewhere else for food. I doubt those specific feeders are their only food source. If their houses are this close together, I assume they live in a pretty well populated area and its pretty common for people to have bird feeders.", "Bro, it's bird feeders. Lmfao.", "Your opinion is just wrong. It\u2019s bird feeders. She isn\u2019t hand feeding raccoons. If she stops feeding the birds they will find another bird feeder. They don\u2019t become helpless.", "Yeah I\u2019m speculating that maybe that\u2019s the real issue idk. I haven\u2019t noticed an increase in bird droppings on my own cars. I mean there\u2019s some but not more than usual. The birds are mostly outback where the feeders and trees are away from the street", "I\u2019d personally buy some chickens, ducks and emu.", "NTA    and add some fish..  let the sea bird assault begin !\n\nOh.. and fuck todd.", "If it was bird droppings I think he would have lead with that, because that's reasonable.  (\"Hey, I don't want to have to park my cars in the garage 100% of the time because you're attracting more than usual\")\n\nBut \"my family is terrified of birds\"?  Nah.", "You have found the answer.   That is absolutely it.  He just blamed it on the family because he thought that was less petty", "NTA The kids are terrified because the parents are terrified. \nI am so sorry for you & your wife's struggles. I am glad she has found something that makes her happy. Birds are cool!  I have a clear bird feeder that attaches to my window. We call it cat tv.", "Yep, it tracks that a man who thinks you can control birds would also scream at his family. No surprises there. Keep your distance from now on. Splash out on the extra good bird seed. Your wife deserves it. NTA.", "But you have spoken to each other ... outside, presumably in the yard, before this incident. The children have played outside before?? How do they function? Do they ever leave their home? I\u2019m so confused... \n\nSeems like if you lived next to someone for a year you might notice if the family all ran screaming back in to their house every time a bird flew in their yard. \n\nUnless your backyard looks like a Hitchcock movie scene.... there\u2019s no logical explanation for your neighbor\u2019s sudden reaction to birds. His behavior sounds very strange. Honestly, I hate flying things around my head but unless these birds are attacking his family... who even notices birds?? These people are weird. You should move. \n\nSince you only engage in small talk with your neighbors, I am assuming they would have no knowledge of your fertility struggles. So I can\u2019t imagine your neighbor\u2019s comment was intentionally meant to hurt your wife\u2019s feelings.\n\neta", "You\u2019re NTA. Have you seen the Bird Buddy feeder? Im sure there are other brands as well. It has a camera and logs the type of birds. Maybe that would be a good gift to help cheer up your wife since your neighbor is such a dick.", "Grabbing you counts as assault FYI. NTA he can get a net and fix it over his fence/yard/house so no birds can stay in his yard.", "I second the vote for Merlin. I have learned of several new bird varieties using it. Your wife will love it!\n\nEdited to add the judgement: NTA.", "It is so much fun.", "Merlin is the best. I also like the audio feature because I have been able to start putting the calls to the animals.", "Your wife can also make lists of bird sightings on eBird! It\u2019s super useful for research and fun for fellow birders to share lists and hotspots together! I\u2019m glad birding has brought her some much deserved happiness.", "I would love to know too. I\u2019m fascinated by those wiggle hops", "I too would like an army of emus.", "They're not birds, they're feathered dinosaurs.", "AKA Cobra chickens.", "I live in a place where geese come to lay eggs and raise their babies. We ALL hate geese season. But we deal with it. They are loud, mean and poop EVERYWHERE. But beyond shooing then away from my own private property I can\u2019t do anything about them and have just learned to keep my ice scraper in my car year round as it is useful with particularly aggressive geese", "NTA and invest in cameras around your property especially a ring. He gets handsy again you have proof of the police are called. Plus when your a t work you will get alerts if he is stupid enough to approach your wife\nWhile she is home alone. His entitlement seems to no. Bounds.", "And add a few more", "More people should be terrified of Canadian Geese.  They are MEAN!!", "That's fair, geese can be mean bastards.", "Lol! \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah I completely agree! Birds are harmless and yeah geese would be different but they don\u2019t eat from bird feeders", "Sounds more like providing for wildlife to me!", "And a Canadian Goose", "I'm terrified of birds, stupid, but I am. However OP is not responsible for my fears nor those of his neighbors. NTA and his neighbors are horrible.", "More likely to get the response he wanted.", "You want some interesting bird movements, look up the American woodcock. It's song is super ridiculous too. One of my fav birds, by far", "Oh yeah I understand that!! I was just saying in context of birds that people could have in their yards, geese/swans were the only scary ones I could think of. Obviously, there are other dangerous bird species, but saying those ones wouldn't have made sense. Regardless, it's normal birds, neighbors need to chill.", "LMFAO I see your point. But let's not inspire OP to do something that they'll end up liable for \ud83e\udd23", "Yes!!", "You said woodcock. \\beavis and butthead laugh", "It's even better when people set it to music.", "Yeah for real! Therapy is a great idea. Now if she were feeding a flock of geese I would understand because they are known to bite", "Lol I know, but seriously Google this bird. The face is derpy enough to fit the name.", "My favorite song people have paired the woodcock to is Shine. Dun nunuh du-nunununuh PEET."]}
