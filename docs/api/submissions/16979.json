Lee is wealthy and my mom never had to work and I was given everything growing up. The only thing we never received was acceptance from Lee\u2019s family\u2014they were not pleased that Lee chose to marry a widow with a child. Lee and I were close and he continued to care for me even after my brother Sam(18) was born. My mom clearly favored Sam and didn\u2019t really focus much on me. \n\nLee\u2019s relatives warmed up to my mom a little with the birth of Sam but I was still treated like something invisible. Sam was often invited to Lee\u2019s relatives\u2019 houses to play and he and I are not very close. I decided to go to university overseas and Lee gave me enough money that I didn\u2019t have to work or worry financially. He also was the only one calling/writing me regularly. I talked to my mom/Sam like once every couple of months during my university days.\n\nAfter graduation, Lee wanted me to \u201ccome home\u201d but I wanted to work and be on my own for a bit. The pandemic happened and I was unable to fly back. When the lockdown was over, my family came to visit me once and left when I preferred to continue working where I am. Lee came to visit me a few more times by himself. \n\nA few months ago Lee passed from a disease he never let anyone know he had. In his will, he left his businesses and house and most valuables to his relatives, my mom almost nothing though she can keep what he has already given her\u20142 cars, jewelry, and cash ~$60K(my mom never legally married him), Sam ~$150K and the rest of the money to me. It was 7-figure USD, a life changing amount.\n\nTurns out Sam is not Lee\u2019s biological child, which he found out only recently. \n\nMy mom and Sam were mad, of course, and demanded that I share money with them. I said I\u2019m willing to put the money in some low risk investments and we can split the gain. Not good enough. They want at least 25% each of what Lee left me. I argued that it\u2019s not like they are left destitute. Sam can still go to a good university (if he cares enough for further education) and my mom have enough money to get her own place and the investments will give us all long-termed incomes. They called me greedy and planned to take legal action, but Lee\u2019s relatives told them that they could make my mom and Sam\u2019s lives very difficult if they tried to give me a hard time and go against Lee\u2019s wishes. \n\nI intend to do as I promised them, splitting the gains from the investment with my mom and Sam. I won\u2019t let them touch the money Lee left me though because I don\u2019t trust them to not go through that money in just a few years.

She betrayed him and he clearly loved you like his own.\nDon't let them make you feel bad about your decision.", "NTA\n\nIt is your money which your (step)father wanted you to have. \n\nFrankly they could whistle if it was me. Lee wanted you to have that money ad left them what he wanted them to have.", "I think YTA for giving them anything. The man who was a father to you was tricked by your mother into raising a child he thought was his. Why are you not fully cutting ties? I would call my mom a few choice words until my voice was whoares. I'll never understand why people keep relationships based off blood history. Your mother doesn't deserve your money, your attention, or your love. So why give her any of it anymore?", "NTA.\n\nYou were the daughter he chose, I'm sure he loved Sam, but on finding out your mother cheated and lied to and on him when he found he was ill, he changed his will to favour someone who had always loved and cared for him.\n\nI wouldn't even give them the gains from it, play stupid games win stupid prizes. I'd definitely go low or no contact with them, you're grieving so I understand your thought process but they are leeches and will take every penny they can from you. \n\nIf possible use some of the money to invest in property and don't tell them, move somewhere they won't find you.

Sounds like you don't owe either of them anything either", "I believe in following the will- and honoring the will.  Lee has a right to do whatever he wants with his things outlined in his will.  To do anything else than what the deceased wanted is disrespectful IMO.  Don\u2019t split the gains, don\u2019t give away the money- honor Lee and his wishes.  Sorry for your loss.", "NTA.\n\nBut don't share profits with them. Actually don't do anything that can be misconstrued as you recognizing they have some right to the inheritance.\n\nNot that you could risk losing it, but it can easily bring you headaches if your mother and brother are obstinate and have money for a lawyer.", "NTA. Be sure to create a will for your inheritance. I\u2019m on the fence whether to let them know or not. People have done unlawful things for less money.", "NTA don't give them shit not a dime", "NTA. Don\u2019t give them anything", "Lee left his money to you, and he knew all three of you well. He could have split it between the three of you, but he didn\u2019t. You are not obligated to give.

Let things settle down for a year or two before you decide what to do with YOUR inheritance.", "Lee made his wishes very clear in his will and he was aware of your mom's betrayal and Sam not being his biological son. Definitely NTA and they are lucky you are willing to share the gains from investments with them. You owe them nothing.", "You're definitely NTA!\nFor whatever reason, Lee gave the money to you.\nHe seemed to know what he was doing, giving the business and house to a relative, money to you and a fair sum to your mum and Sam.\nYour mother got to keep the Jewellery (which I'm assuming will be high valued), not 1, but 2 cars and a good amount of cash. This is inspite of cheating on the man because of whom she didn't ever have to work. Anybody who's been cheated on can tell you what a horrible experience it is. \nThen to find out that said cheating led to the birth of a child you considered your own flesh and blood is a deeply hurtful. Inspite of that Sam got more than double the amount of money his mom did because it wasn't his fault that he was illegitimate.\nYou are already being overly good by agreeing to split the earning from investments, I would strongly advise against it. If you really feel the need to do it, please consult a Tax expert before you do so.\nAfter they threatened to sue you for it, I would carefully guard against any interaction with them", "NTA, as long as he was of sound mind and made his will without coercion.

Now it's your money and you can decide if you want to share otherwise....", "NTA- You are super generous with what you offered after the what you were treated in your childhood.\n\nLee sounds awesome, he found a way to show you how much he loved you.   I'm sure that you would rather have him in your life. \n\nTo your mom and half brother, karma?  Not to be cold but yeah.

They don't deserve a dime, do as Lee wished.", "You owe them nothing. Lee wanted you to have that money. Don't promise them anything. I'm serious. You're a better person than they are and I'm sorry, but clearly your mom cheated on him, foisted a child on him that wasn't his, lied to him for their entire marriage, and Lee did what he did because that's what he wanted to do. Honor what he wanted and keep it. NTA", "NTA. You are a smart young woman. She probably married Lee in the first place for money. Then everyone finds out Sam isn't his biological kid. On top of that, Lee never officially married your mom. She is literally owed nothing. Only things she has in her name are hers. It sucks for Sam but he isn't even related to Lee from biology or even Marriage. SAM is literally a kid Lee raised and paid for and that's it. This money was left to you, specifically by Lee, most likely because he cared about you and knew you had a good head on your shoulders. Cherish his gift to you and his love for you. Your family is no longer your family as all they care about is their greed. \n\nYou are already doing more for them than they deserve by splitting some of your investment earnings.

So sorry for your loss he sounded like an amazingly decent man! Yeah NTA, sod them and don\u2019t even dare split them gains!

Don't even give them the gains. It will never be enough.", "Lee knew exactly how he wanted his estate distributed and was very intentional in his directives. To do anything with the inheritance that changes his directives is a slap in the face to a man who has never been anything but good to you.\n\ndo not disrespect him by ignoring his dying wish.", "So let me get this straight. A cheating gf and an illegitimate son trying to claw for inheritance that they probably don\u2019t deserve to begin with? They are neither married (mother) or blood related (brother) to Lee? Sounds like a Game of Thrones episode SMH. NTA", "NTA- Very sorry for your loss. I think your idea is great & smart. Making sure they have income instead of blowing through it. You went to school and worked not expecting and not wanting to be supported by your stepdad. & you kept in good contact with him. I\u2019m going to state the obvious\u2026he was proud of you and trusts you. With your idea of making sure your mom and brother have some kind of income, he was right in doing so.

He gave your mother and Sam precisely what he wanted them to have.  \n\nHonor his wishes.", "NTA - he took you on willingly. Your mum is the one that fucked Sam over.

Your mom lied to him all those years about Sam. I\u2019m shocked he left her anything at all.

It sounds as though you had a fantastic relationship with Lee and he chose to leave you this money.\n\nIf your mum and Sam were left destitute then I could understand why you might want to give them at least some money but that isn't the case and Lee has left you all the sums he wanted to. \n\nLee wanted you to have this money, please don't feel pressured into giving them anything, investment gains or otherwise, this is your money and you should do with it as you wish.", "NTA.  Keep every penny, and if your mom and sam stop acting like assholes for a few years, maybe you can throw them a few bucks.  Don\u2019t commit yourself to giving them anything.", "NTA. In fact, I think choosing to share part of yours with them could create more problems.\n\nI have siblings and I think I have a good relationship with my parents. But if something happened and they chose to give my siblings all/most of their inheritance, there's nothing I can do about that.", "NTA. Lee wasn't stupid. Your mother cheated on him and neglected you in favor of her newer, more acceptable child. His whole family did that. Interesting that they are coming to your defense now that they no longer favor Sam.\n\nThis money belongs to you alone. You need a fiduciary to help you manage and protect it. Make sure your money manager has a fiduciary responsibility to you, and is not selling whatever crappy branded stock package his company is pushing.

Don't give anything to your negligent mother or her golden child.", "Your stepdad obviously felt a lot for you, it was his decision and he provided for your mother and stepbrother, I wouldn\u2019t even share the interest with them, like might see this this as an admission of guilt over being given more than them! \nHe must\u2019ve had his reasons, so trust his judgement and keep it for yourself!", "NTA. Lee wrote a legal will. Your mom and Sam will just be wasting everybodies time trying to get it overturned.

Your Mom and Sam may both have treated Leo similarly to how they treated you.  He left them enough money to get situated in their lives.  \n\nBut you treated Leo with the respect you would give to your father (or uncle), which is why he left you more money.

Then, cut contact with both Sam and Mom.", "NTA, but your deceased father is, he finds out that your brother is not his biological son and automatically throws him away (compared to what he had, what he gave to your brother is nothing), he also puts you in this situation, even so, no You are the bad one but I think that both your mother and father are a waste, and also your father's family", "NTA.

The difference between that and 150k is pretty staggering. Why did Lee choose to punish Sam by leaving him only a fraction of what he left you?
