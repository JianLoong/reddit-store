Lee is wealthy and my mom never had to work and I was given everything growing up. The only thing we never received was acceptance from Lee\u2019s family\u2014they were not pleased that Lee chose to marry a widow with a child. Lee and I were close and he continued to care for me even after my brother Sam(18) was born. My mom clearly favored Sam and didn\u2019t really focus much on me. \n\nLee\u2019s relatives warmed up to my mom a little with the birth of Sam but I was still treated like something invisible. Sam was often invited to Lee\u2019s relatives\u2019 houses to play and he and I are not very close. I decided to go to university overseas and Lee gave me enough money that I didn\u2019t have to work or worry financially. He also was the only one calling/writing me regularly. I talked to my mom/Sam like once every couple of months during my university days.\n\nAfter graduation, Lee wanted me to \u201ccome home\u201d but I wanted to work and be on my own for a bit. The pandemic happened and I was unable to fly back. When the lockdown was over, my family came to visit me once and left when I preferred to continue working where I am. Lee came to visit me a few more times by himself. \n\nA few months ago Lee passed from a disease he never let anyone know he had. In his will, he left his businesses and house and most valuables to his relatives, my mom almost nothing though she can keep what he has already given her\u20142 cars, jewelry, and cash ~$60K(my mom never legally married him), Sam ~$150K and the rest of the money to me. It was 7-figure USD, a life changing amount.\n\nTurns out Sam is not Lee\u2019s biological child, which he found out only recently. \n\nMy mom and Sam were mad, of course, and demanded that I share money with them. I said I\u2019m willing to put the money in some low risk investments and we can split the gain. Not good enough. They want at least 25% each of what Lee left me. I argued that it\u2019s not like they are left destitute. Sam can still go to a good university (if he cares enough for further education) and my mom have enough money to get her own place and the investments will give us all long-termed incomes. They called me greedy and planned to take legal action, but Lee\u2019s relatives told them that they could make my mom and Sam\u2019s lives very difficult if they tried to give me a hard time and go against Lee\u2019s wishes. \n\nI intend to do as I promised them, splitting the gains from the investment with my mom and Sam. I won\u2019t let them touch the money Lee left me though because I don\u2019t trust them to not go through that money in just a few years.

She cheated on Lee.", "Sam is 7 years younger, if OP was 18 when they went to uni Sam was only 11. You can't blame a kid 11 and younger for visiting relatives, they often don't get a choice.", "I don\u2019t understand your response.\n\nMy suggestion of purchasing them something relatively inexpensive like a house is because it is a one off and far less cumbersome than offering to share the appreciation of assets over a lifetime.   \nAs I stated, sharing appreciated assets is administratively impossible because the owner of assets needs to be free to invest their assets for a variety of financial and tax reasons. That is nit his any financial advisor wouid set things up.   \nHe can of course give them a finite sum and let them reap the benefit of their investments. \n\nOr give them nothing because the testator didn\u2019t want them to have anything. But OP should not make a foolish promise that will caise problems for the rest of his life", "This is a fair point. It was definitely on the mom to foster a good sibling relationship.

Although, he's not looking too good if he's focused on getting money from his sister instead of some shame for having been passed off as Lee's bio son when he's not.", "I will try to be clearer.\n\nFirst, Sam and mother do not care for OP. They see her as \"the gatekeeper of the treasure\" they'd like to put their hands on, instead of a living, breathing person with feelings. It's hard to be benevolent towards someone who sees you as nothing more than an ATM.\n\nSecond, I do not see a house as something relatively inexpensive, especially since COL has been rising everywhere. If OP had inherited, let's say, 1 million, buying a house worth 200K is far from inexpensive, and it would certainly be against the spirit of Lee's legacy.\n\nThird and final, maybe the problem lies in English not being my first language. By \"returns of the investments\" I was thinking about investments divided in \"chunks\" that would yield interests quarterly, or something like that. OP could share some of those interest amounts without touching the bulk of the inheritance. \n\nWhere I live it's common practice when people have enough money to make that kind of investment, since the interest is taxed separately from the invested capital.", "I was assuming the amount was quite large as it was described as \"life changing\" and the son got $150,000 and was suggesting gifts that were \"fixed\" in value and only if he wanted to be generous during his lifetime.\n\nLet me be clear that I don't think OP owes these people anything.\n\nMy comment is solely that to \"promise\" to share the appreciated value of the assets is potentially going to cause issues down the line. Over the course of his life, unless he squanders it, the amount will be more than the initial inheritance.\n\nIt was a WARNING that he should NOT promise to share the appreciated value of the assets.\n\nHe should consult a financial advisor and lawyer before he makes any promises or does anything with his inheritance.", "Although the two of us have been looking at the issue from different angles, I do fully agree with your final sentence, with a tiny caveat:\n\n*She* should consult a financial advisor and lawyer before she makes any promises or does anything with *her* inheritance.\n\n(I apologize if I look petty for pointing out this detail, and I reassure you I am in no way belittling your contribution to the debate).", "same here, as soon as my mom had my brother with my step father they forgot all about me, I was 10.", "NTA\n\nIf Lee wanted to leave either of them more money, he would have.

He treated you like a daughter probably because despite his family, you still treated him like a father. You yourself said you talked to your mother every couple months whereas Lee contacted you and visited you regularly. You are NOT selfish for keeping what is rightfully yours.

While also being a crap mom to you? \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them anything, OP.", "Yes, I am fully considered a millionaire with my inheritance.\n\nAs for Sam, he has always been\u2026spoiled and difficult. My mom never said no to him and he got everything he wanted. Lee was the stricter parent but Sam would always hide behind someone, like Lee\u2019s relatives, when he got in trouble. He had to repeat a grade because he refused to put in any work and I would say his academic record would not give him good university choices.\n\nHe had already wrecked 2 cars from reckless driving. He was also caught shop lifting once when he was 16 because his friends dared him to. I completed understand Lee not wanting to leave him more money than he did. \n\nSam is completely clueless about his bio dad though. Even my mom said she was almost certain Sam had to be Lee\u2019s child because there was only \u201cone other guy.\u201d My mom has had no contact with him for years.", "They had a wedding but nothing legally binding.", "honestly, I think they only sided with op cause of the affair. bet they pulled way back on their relationship with Sam after the found out. still, it's better than what ops own mother gave them.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give them anything. They\u2019ll never be satisfied and never stop hounding you for money.", "[removed]", "NTA and good for you! You sound like a genuinely nice person.", "Nta, and Lee\u2019s will should hold up since your mom and brother received stuff.  Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t share anything with them for making demands.  They will just demand more.", "NTA   You can afford a lawyer now. Get legal protection.", "NTA. You are talking about setting them up with a life long income (of whatever size) to assist them for the rest of their lives! How could you even think that your anything less then an angel here. I suggest that you setup a trust to handle a % of that investment gains into and setup reasons for disbursement to them. Things like medical bills, school bills and a stipend for food/rent. Don't think upper class either, think Minimum Wage full time income levels. If they decide to improve themselves with education then the amounts raise. I believe the saying is \"God helps those who help themselves\". If that is good enough for an entire religion why is that not good enough for you? If they don't want to help themselves then your trust can at least keep them from starving and being homeless. I would also use the trust as the only means to contact them or them you.", "NTA. He'd be rolling in his grave if you shared, I know I would. Fuck them for favouritism. Fuck them for leaving you out of things. Fuck them for cheating on Lee under his nose and have the **AUDACITY** to nag you for the money.", "NTA, Lee left you what he did intentionally and it's not your fault he left your mom and Sam a smaller amount. Given the way they treated you they are lucky you are even considering giving them gains. Be very careful, once you open the purse they will have their hands in it for life.", "NTA What your SD did was f$&ked. Not your problem though. Give your Mum and Sam money if you love them. Don\u2019t if you don\u2019t. I will be giving my sister half of everything even though I am fairly certain that she has been written out of the will. That\u2019s because she is my best friend and I want her to do well vs feeling some kind of obligation.", "NTA. You are being incredibly generous.", "NTA. You should really honor Lee's final wishes and not give your mother or your brother any additional funds. Sam is not Lee's child at all, and your mother was a liar and a cheat about Sam's true parentage. They both sound entitled and non-deserving of additional money from your inheritance from Lee. If he thought that they deserved more than what was in his will, Lee could have changed it at any time before his death but did not.", "NTA - I think it is very nice for you to share your future gains and they should be happy with that. Def get a lawyer involved to set it up properly.", "NTA.", "NTA- Don't compromise with them. Lee left you the money for a good reason. His wife of 2 decades cheated on him and had a kid that she lied about and said was his. You aren't robbing them of anything.", "NTA", "NTA - you probably shouldn't give them any money at all since your mother betrayed Lee by having an affair.  Also, why do you want a continued relationship with them?  It doesn't sound like you were treated as a daughter by anyone but Lee.", "NTA. Lee made his wishes crystal clear.", "NTA they didn\u2019t get as much as you but he knew he was the one who cared about you.  His will is exactly what he wanted for all three of you.", "NTA you\u2019re being very generous", "your bro is from an affair. as such no money for im and your mom. easy decision. NTA", "Nta. I'd argue that even if they sue you they wouldn't be able to get a dime from your split, since your step father had already given their part of the will.", "NTA. You are more than generous with your plans. \n\nTo be frank $150k is also life changing for a lot of people. It\u2019s not a small sum.", "NTA. Funny how the tables tuned when the money is involved. \n\nAsk them how they are entitled since lee never married your mother and Sam was never been his son.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Pretend you got a call from the executor and there was some sort of mix up and he actually left you nothing, then ask for shares of what he left them and see how they respond.", "Agreed. To them, OP is likely the only person in that trio who Lee considers to be of any import, and even though they never accepted OP, they clearly love Lee and respecting his last wishes is loving him.", "Please make a will immediately because the inheritance that Lee willed to you needs to be protected. Leave your mother and Sam exactly $1.00 so they cannot contest it. You are young but accidents/deaths do happen and they do not deserve to have any of Lee's money (yours now) fall into their greedy, entitled laps.", "First of all - I'm sorry for your loss. Losing a parent - even if it's a stepparent - is really hard. \n\nSecond - Lee left his money to you, because he clearly saw you as his daughter. You do not have to share anything. He also left some for Sam, he can start his life with that amount easily.\n\nThird - your mother seems like a piece of work, she lied to Lee about your brother, she treated you quite badly, she seems like she's only interested in money. \n\nSo, you do not have to share anything, but if you want to, then do what your heart wants. \n\nNTA", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry for your loss, he sounded like an endearing father.  You\u2019re being really generous about the investment sharing. Greedy? They\u2019re the ones being greedy. They need a reminder: \u201cYou get what you get and you don\u2019t throw a fit\u201d", "Nta. Personally, I don\u2019t think you owe them anything or have any reason to even split investment income with them unless you want to. Lee left the money to you. He wanted you to have it. He knew you were not treated well by either your mom or Sam and that neither of them have much of a moral compass. Poor man. He must have been so hurt by your mother\u2019s behavior.", "NTA. But if you give them the gains you would be to yourself. Who wants to deal with that and then in perpetuity. Go NC or LC and live your best life as Lee intended for you", "NTA, but your mum sounds like one. I'm sorry you lost Lee.", "NTA Get som elegant advice on giving any money re:investments and some accountant advise on the taxes on those gains. \n\nThis sounds like a stressful and shocking situation for you two kids to be in, but your post shows maturity and an ethics that will help you get through this moment. Get that legal/financial advise before proceeding with giving them anything though", "NTA - good for you. Poor Lee tho, to find out all that. Keep to your plan. It's his wishes and stick to that. You're a good kid.. well adult.", "Your mom is lucky she got anything at all...", "NTA  don\u2019t give them a cent. He wanted you to have the money (including any gain). Honor his wishes.", "NTA you\u2019re doing Lee a disservice though by still supporting your mom and brother financially. If he wanted them to have any of his money he would have given it to them. Or had it been a case of him not trusting them to handle it correctly he would have just put you as the financial (advisor, executor?) but he didn\u2019t. He gave them what he wanted them to have and you the remainder.", "NTA, in my opinion you shouldnt even give the money from the investment you gonna do either", "NTA", "NTA.\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. It\u2019s clear he loved you dearly. Your mum however needs a reality check.", "NTA\n\nYou've already made a generous offer to your mother and Sam.\n\nLee clearly loved you like a bio daughter, honour his memory and keep the money as he wanted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOut of curiosity, how does Lee's family now treat Sam, knowing they are not actually bio related?\n\n  \nEdit: sorry, got the wrong gender", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry for your loss - your stepdad sounds like a awesome guy", "> so lee might have felt bad about that too\n\nYeah I really like this Lee fellow. He realized at some point just how OP had been failed in that sense, probably long ago since he was more active than mom and brother- and honestly, sounds like OP might have their crap together a little bit more..", "I mean this in the gentlest way possible but you are silly.\n\nWould they even look your way had they been on the receiving end of that amount? Did Lee tell you in his will to share with them? They didn\u2019t treat you like family from what you shared, so I\u2019m not sure why you feel the need to treat them like it.", "NTA Lee wanted you to have the money. Your mother cheated on Lee, Sam isn't his biological child. Don't be guilted into giving them Lee's money. He didn't want that.", "NTA.\n\nSo sorry you lost your dad and the one family member who really adored you. The people who love you work to stay in your life, Lee did that.

Honour your dads wishes !!!", "NTA, you\u2019re only following Lees wishes.

Your mother basically had an affair and favoured the affair baby over you and the person that provided for them. Just cut them off.", "NTA. Give them bugger all. Tell them to take a hike or pound sand or rocks. Take your pick. Once you give them something, they'll always be waiting with their grubby little hands out for the rest of your life.", "NTA, this whole situation is kinda f*cked. But i guess Lee knew, or had a hunch, who's truly by his side until the end and chose to distribute his inheritance in a way that fits.

What's the bet that Lee, knowing he was going to die from an illness he never disclosed, also knew that he couldn't have kids, and that Sam was never his?

The tiny bit about not being his son... amazing."]}
