Lee is wealthy and my mom never had to work and I was given everything growing up. The only thing we never received was acceptance from Lee\u2019s family\u2014they were not pleased that Lee chose to marry a widow with a child. Lee and I were close and he continued to care for me even after my brother Sam(18) was born. My mom clearly favored Sam and didn\u2019t really focus much on me. \n\nLee\u2019s relatives warmed up to my mom a little with the birth of Sam but I was still treated like something invisible. Sam was often invited to Lee\u2019s relatives\u2019 houses to play and he and I are not very close. I decided to go to university overseas and Lee gave me enough money that I didn\u2019t have to work or worry financially. He also was the only one calling/writing me regularly. I talked to my mom/Sam like once every couple of months during my university days.\n\nAfter graduation, Lee wanted me to \u201ccome home\u201d but I wanted to work and be on my own for a bit. The pandemic happened and I was unable to fly back. When the lockdown was over, my family came to visit me once and left when I preferred to continue working where I am. Lee came to visit me a few more times by himself. \n\nA few months ago Lee passed from a disease he never let anyone know he had. In his will, he left his businesses and house and most valuables to his relatives, my mom almost nothing though she can keep what he has already given her\u20142 cars, jewelry, and cash ~$60K(my mom never legally married him), Sam ~$150K and the rest of the money to me. It was 7-figure USD, a life changing amount.\n\nTurns out Sam is not Lee\u2019s biological child, which he found out only recently. \n\nMy mom and Sam were mad, of course, and demanded that I share money with them. I said I\u2019m willing to put the money in some low risk investments and we can split the gain. Not good enough. They want at least 25% each of what Lee left me. I argued that it\u2019s not like they are left destitute. Sam can still go to a good university (if he cares enough for further education) and my mom have enough money to get her own place and the investments will give us all long-termed incomes. They called me greedy and planned to take legal action, but Lee\u2019s relatives told them that they could make my mom and Sam\u2019s lives very difficult if they tried to give me a hard time and go against Lee\u2019s wishes. \n\nI intend to do as I promised them, splitting the gains from the investment with my mom and Sam. I won\u2019t let them touch the money Lee left me though because I don\u2019t trust them to not go through that money in just a few years.

Splitting the gains is already nice from you. But don't give your mother to much, otherwise she will pay a lawyer to sue you.", "NTA - The best way to honor Lee\u2019s wishes is to let them have exactly what he wanted and no more.  They aren\u2019t entitled to what Lee plainly didn\u2019t want them to have.", "NTA\n\nThere's a reason you got what you got and they got what they got.\n\nAlso, good job on Lee's relatives stepping up for you and your late stepdad.", "NTA. He left the money to YOU. There is a reason for that!  I\u2019m glad his family is backing you up!", "NTA, honestly wouldn\u2019t give them a cent tho. They both sound like they suck", "NTA - it's *YOUR* money.  Do what you think is best.", "NTA. Do you think Lee knew that Sam was not his biological son, due to cheating, and thus decided Sam could be coddled enough by his mother and her family, but wouldn't inherit most of his money? \n\nKeep Lee's wishes. You owe nothing to any of them.", "NTA \n\nYour mom sucks and I would cut her off. They both know you have that money and will look to you to solve all their problems.", "You\u2019re the only one who never felt entitled to Lee\u2019s money, and the only one who really cared for him instead of his money. \n\nKarma has its way with these things. Don\u2019t go against his wishes now.", "NTA\n\nKeep the money you inherited, and do what you want with it. \n\nAnd please talk with a tax advisor for your country before proceeding with your plan to split the gains from the investments. Remember that because those investments will be in your name, you're likely the one to be liable for the taxes on those gains.", "NTA. Keep the money. You're already going above and beyond by splitting the investment gains.", "NTA. You reap what you sow?", "NTA. Lee willed that money to you and you've been more than fair by offering to split the return on your investments. The fact that they've threatened to sue you to try to get more of the money is just ridiculous. It sounds like you had a special bond with Lee, I'm sorry that you have lost a big supporter in your life. I hope you can honor his wishes and do good with the money you received.", "NTA. Nicer than I would have been. Glad Lee's family intervened to shut your mom and Sam down.", "NTA, your offer was generous and fair.", "NTA. Lee left it to YOU. He obviously loved you. You are under no obligation to anyone. Enjoy the money, I'm sure you will honor Lee's gift the right way.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s awful that Lee thought Sam was his child for so long and apparently punished him for his mom\u2019s actions. But you definitely are not obliged to share with them. \n\nIf you could afford it, I\u2019d give Sam apart of the investment income. \n\nFor your mom, nothing. She sounds awful.", "NTA, I wouldn't give them a dime. Let them fight you in court, you can afford it now. Good luck.", "Don't split the gains with them. She cheated on him and Sam already have more than a lot of people will ever have in their bank account. His dying wish is that you get the money. Keep it or donate some to charity.", "NTA. Lee left you the money because he loved you like you were his own daughter even when your own mother neglected you. I'm glad to see that his family is standing up for you!", "NTA - Lee left all of you with what he wanted to leave all of you.  Just because they are now seeing the reality of the relationship (hindsight is always 20/20) does not give them ANY right to come after you.  Like Lee's family said, if they come after you they are going to be the ones that ultimately pay.  Stand your ground.\n\nAlso, that is very generous and noble of you to split the investment profits.  Never change that heart of yours.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give them anything. Your stepdad made his wishes very clear.", "NTA, but I do feel sorry for Sam. \n\nYou weren\u2019t Lee\u2019s biological daughter either, so I guess Sam feels he\u2019s being punished not for not being Lee\u2019s biological son, but for Lee not knowing that at first, which I presume Sam didn\u2019t either. That\u2019s gotta be tough, finding out that the guy you thought was your dad wasn\u2019t, and then finding out posthumously that he saw you as lesser than another child he raised who wasn\u2019t his biological child, just because of the deceit on your Mum\u2019s part involved in his case. \n\nHonestly, you\u2019ll be NTA whatever you decide to do with *your* money, but given that you and Sam share a biological mother, you might want to give Sam a little extra. \n\nForget about your mum, sounds like it was her deceit that caused this, and now her chickens have come home to roost.", "NTA. They got what Lee wanted them to have. You're actually going against his wishes if you give them anything else. BTW make a will very quickly leaving them nothing so they know your death won't help them because they sound sketchy.", "This is so similar to another recent post that I have a hard time believing that it's real. \n\nThe fiction writers on this sub are plentiful and they tend to cycle through themes periodically.\n\nNTA for not sharing. \n\nYour mom was foolish. People shouldn't be putting all of their eggs in their partner's basket. She has decades to pursue her education and build a career.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
