Lee is wealthy and my mom never had to work and I was given everything growing up. The only thing we never received was acceptance from Lee\u2019s family\u2014they were not pleased that Lee chose to marry a widow with a child. Lee and I were close and he continued to care for me even after my brother Sam(18) was born. My mom clearly favored Sam and didn\u2019t really focus much on me. \n\nLee\u2019s relatives warmed up to my mom a little with the birth of Sam but I was still treated like something invisible. Sam was often invited to Lee\u2019s relatives\u2019 houses to play and he and I are not very close. I decided to go to university overseas and Lee gave me enough money that I didn\u2019t have to work or worry financially. He also was the only one calling/writing me regularly. I talked to my mom/Sam like once every couple of months during my university days.\n\nAfter graduation, Lee wanted me to \u201ccome home\u201d but I wanted to work and be on my own for a bit. The pandemic happened and I was unable to fly back. When the lockdown was over, my family came to visit me once and left when I preferred to continue working where I am. Lee came to visit me a few more times by himself. \n\nA few months ago Lee passed from a disease he never let anyone know he had. In his will, he left his businesses and house and most valuables to his relatives, my mom almost nothing though she can keep what he has already given her\u20142 cars, jewelry, and cash ~$60K(my mom never legally married him), Sam ~$150K and the rest of the money to me. It was 7-figure USD, a life changing amount.\n\nTurns out Sam is not Lee\u2019s biological child, which he found out only recently. \n\nMy mom and Sam were mad, of course, and demanded that I share money with them. I said I\u2019m willing to put the money in some low risk investments and we can split the gain. Not good enough. They want at least 25% each of what Lee left me. I argued that it\u2019s not like they are left destitute. Sam can still go to a good university (if he cares enough for further education) and my mom have enough money to get her own place and the investments will give us all long-termed incomes. They called me greedy and planned to take legal action, but Lee\u2019s relatives told them that they could make my mom and Sam\u2019s lives very difficult if they tried to give me a hard time and go against Lee\u2019s wishes. \n\nI intend to do as I promised them, splitting the gains from the investment with my mom and Sam. I won\u2019t let them touch the money Lee left me though because I don\u2019t trust them to not go through that money in just a few years.

That\u2019s gotta be tough, finding out that the guy you thought was your dad wasn\u2019t, and then finding out posthumously that he saw you as lesser than another child he raised who wasn\u2019t his biological child, just because of the deceit on your Mum\u2019s part involved in his case. \n\nHonestly, you\u2019ll be NTA whatever you decide to do with *your* money, but given that you and Sam share a biological mother, you might want to give Sam a little extra. \n\nForget about your mum, sounds like it was her deceit that caused this, and now her chickens have come home to roost.", "NTA.
