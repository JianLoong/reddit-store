This is animal neglect (at worst abuse), you saved the animals in his care, and now the aunt is aware of his short comings, she'll keep an eye on the animals so they are not abused further.", "Your cousin was abusing his pets. NTA.", "NTA and people saying you shouldn\u2019t have gotten involved are encouraging neglect of animals. Not cool.", "NTA - Neglect needs to be brought up, and that's what he was doing to those poor defenceless reptiles.", "NTA at all.\n\nOnce your cousin calmed down, you can help 'em with the fewer reppies they have and teach them through the process.", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA, but your cousin is. \n\n\nHe needs to understand that reptiles are live animals and have specific care needs, regardless of his interests. \n\n\nIf he's not caring for his animals properly, he is abusing them. He now knows this. If his response is anything other than \"I didn't realise, i feel terrible and will spend time rectifying this\" then he 100% shouldn't be allowed to continue abusing these poor animals.", "NTA - You tried save animals, well done", "So your cousins are ok he's abusing and not given the correct care to his pets.\n\nYeah YNTA but the cousins are", "NTA. It\u2019s his fault for neglecting the animals. You did the right thing by calling him out and saving them!", "NTA\n\nhe was being neglectful, borderline abusive to his animals. Doesn't matter if they are reptiles, same would be if he had cats or dogs...or even children. It is everyone's jobs to protect those who cannot protect themselves. \n\nIf he raises it again...call him out on being neglectful. Do not apologise to him, ask him if he has learnt better care now.", "NTA \n\nThere is NEVER an excuse for animal neglect and cruelty, thank you for stepping in and doing the right thing by these critters.", "NTA Op abusing animals should have consequences as it is beyond wrong. You need to get the rest of the animals he will likely continue to neglect. They weren\u2019t kept in the right conditions so do not expect him to suddenly step up as this pandemic has been going on for over two years now. Anyone that thinks abusing innocent animals like your cousin did is completely wrong and a jerk. Show them pictures of how they looked when you got them and then show images of healthy reptiles of the same species. Throw as much information as you can at them about how your cousin and them are wrong. Just do what you can to get the rest of them into your home or a home where they will not be neglected.", "Exactly, there\u2019s minding your business, but there\u2019s also knowing when you need to intervene in a concerning situation. \nAside from that, you didn\u2019t \u2018get involved\u2019 you were already involved the moment you were asked to care for his animals.", "Oh it is certainly abuse as stuck sheds can cause blindness in some reptiles and other permanent injuries."]}
