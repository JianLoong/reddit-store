She's fattening up and is a much healthier 23 g, and is still gaining. My corn snake was kept in a plastic tub under someone's bed for 4 years and only fed hoppers, so was also very underweight. Her body condition is SO much better now, and she has so much more space. You can see the difference in her - she's active, out and about in her tank, and no longer tries to musk me every time I pick her up.

Sometimes people impulsively will get reptiles or rodents or fish without doing proper research first, but then learn from their mistakes. Your cousin does not seem like someone that will learn from this based off of his response and his denial of his improper care with something as simple as heating and UVB sources.

He needed to be called out, because that had to stop. Tell the cousins if they are into treating animals bad they aren't worth knowing.", "NTA. What he was doing is animal abuse by neglecting them. You did the right thing", "Nta. He is neglecting his reptiles. That isnt ok. Just because they arent soft and fluffy and furry doesnt mean they dont deserve to be treated right.", "NTA and thank you for speaking up for those creatures who couldn\u2019t do it for themselves. If you have any pictures you\u2019d be willing to share, please do!", "You saved the animals FROM him.\n\nNTA.", "It's not like he was doing something harmless. He was neglecting and mistreating living creatures and he deserves to be called out for that. NTA", "NTA..if he had a dog that was starving would he have berated you for feeding it? You choose to pets, any pets then you should care for them correctly. You did the right thing \ud83d\udc4d", "OP=NTA\n\nThe animals were being mistreated--it is sad that your cousins'(plural) think that is acceptable.\n\nAll you did was educate your Aunt.  It was your cousin's(singular) choice NOT to step up and take care of his own animals.  or at least all of them.  SO he scaled down to what he could handle.  That is good.  Do not let anyone tell you that you did wrong.", "NTA.  \n\n\nWhen having a pet, pet owner is responsible to make sure their pet have decent quality of life at the minimum, which means the pet's needs should be met at the minimum.

Good for you! Helping any innocent being that is being abused/neglected and who can\u2019t help themselves is never wrong imo", "That\u2019s what I have been doing. My cousin isn\u2019t a terrible person, just VERY prideful and struggles with things such as asking for help. He is the type of person who would rather fail knowing he did it all by himself than ask for help. He also fell into a pretty common pitfall of impulse buying reptiles, and got overwhelmed. We had a LONG talk about it and he admitted he was a bit jealous of my room and realized he screwed up. He told me money was a big issue for him (He\u2019s only 19) and he had to cheap out on some things. I told him he is more than welcome to use any spare equipment I have as well as gave him some tips to save some money without impacting the animals health. I told him my door is always open if he needs anything. He and I have actually grown closer since the incident and he is keeping a much smaller collection (4 animals vs 20) without any issues.", "until their hair falls out....", "When I was a kid I went to church with a woman whose hobby was taxidermy. She was absolutely lovely, so I've always associated taxidermy with her and always thought it was a bit of an art form. I've never got how people are grossed out by it. But yes, I will grant you that old, mangy taxidermy is pretty gross stuff."]}
