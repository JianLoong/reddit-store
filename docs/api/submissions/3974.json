This is a nightmare waiting to happen. He should know that his fianc\u00e9e has been going behind his back discouraging his nephew from visiting unprompted - a habit that he has encouraged and supported to build their relationship - because he should know what kind of person she is. And his feelings on the matter need to be clarified anyway.", "In my opinion you are NTA this is a conversation that needs to happen with the BIL. I have a feeling that the BIL would not agree and she is trying to make you the bad guy in the situation.", "NAH. The fianc\u00e9e has a reasonable request and you have a valid request that you all get on the same page, especially since you probably don't want to change the rules on a 4-year-old too many times.", "ESH.

You don't get to dismiss her wishes simply because they aren't yours.\n\nShe sucks because the first person she needed to speak to is her fiance.  Not you.  Him.  She didn't because she figured it would be easier to tell you no than risk a fight with her fiance.  How was she not aware that this was normal behavior as I can't imagine she just started coming around.\n\nHe sucks because when moving in together EVERYTHING needs to be discussed.  Seeing as your families are exceptionally close how is this not brought up?  If this was going to be an issue it should have been dealt with before moving in together.\n\nThe only one who doesn't suck is the 4 year old.", "NTA. From what I gather from your post it's your brother's house and he has a standing arrangement of allowing his nephew to drop in and visit which I think is super cute. I get that his fiance moving in means that it's her home too but she's coming off as really unpleasant and I agree with you that it should be up to your brother and not just her if your son stops by anymore. Also what kind of a lady wants to discourage a little boy from visiting his next door neighbor uncle? She's choosing a really negative way to begin this new phase of their relationship and doesn't seem to care about the feelings of a four year old boy and his mother which is not a good look for someone who is joining your family.

Possibly walking in on some sexual activity? I get that your knee jerk reaction is to dump the decision on the brother in law here because you're not used to another person in the house to consider.  She has a right to personal space, and the time to get used to being there with new people/family. Maybe once she's comfortable and knows the routine more, she won't mind.", "YTA.  What makes you too good to talk to your BIL about it yourself?", "NAH, but you all need to have a conversation on boundaries.", "YTA.

Your BIL may have encouraged his little nephew to drop in whenever but it sounds like a dangerous practice to encourage kids to just walk into someone else\u2019s house.", "YTA- nothing wrong with your BIL\u2019s fianc\u00e9e that now lives there politely setting healthy boundaries. Not many people would appreciate unannounced drop in visits, even from a child, on a daily basis. If you can\u2019t respect her as an equal family member and her reasonable requests, it will be on YOU if they decide to move or set less polite boundaries", "YTA. It's her home now too and there could be lots of reasons she's not comfortable with this. You're right to not keep it a secret from BIL but you could have told your son to ask them first. That's good manners generally anyway. And you could have told her it's always been encouraged by BIL and suggested she get on the same page before then telling him yourself. Not ignoring her reasonable request unless it comes from BIL himself.", "YTA", "NAH, this is her home now too so she does have the right to make this request but I think that you should talk to your BIL and let him handle it.", "NTA\n\nBut it is time for a sit down conversation with the BIL and fiancee. I absolutely adore my niece and nephew. If I had this situation where they lived right next door, I couldn't imagine being with someone who would be upset with the kids visiting. \n\nHowever, if your bil's fiancee really feels this strongly about it and your bil is onboard with her feelings, then you have no choice but to respect the new boundaries. You may need to put up a fence as it will be really hard to explain to a 4 year old why they can't walk next door and see their uncle. \n\nThis is a sad situation. I don't have kids myself, however, if I was planning to marry someone and I was living right next door to their relative who had children, I would make every effort to get to know the children and not disrupt any arrangements that they have established.", "NTA / talk to BIL first.", "Esh", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You think that's OK?", "agreed. if she talked to BIL and he said no that would definitely be unfortunate because her request isn\u2019t unreasonable. but if she hasn\u2019t talked to BIL then I think it\u2019s very strange because 1. he is her fianc\u00e9 and they should be able to talk about literally anything and 2. she went to OP before having a conversation with the man she is supposed to marry\u2026 It all seems very passive aggressive lol.", "it definitely is until her name is on the deed. If she truly has a problem with her fianc\u00e9s nephew coming over whenever he wants she can talk to her fianc\u00e9. It seems strange that she wouldn\u2019t do that in the first place anyway", "She lives there. It\u2019s absolutely her home.", "Again, what you're speaking of is issues within their relationship that they need to work out. All that is OP's concern is someone asked her not to let her child just wander in whenever so she shouldn't let her child do that. If she is unhappy about that then she certainly can speak to BIL about it but it remains that someone in that home doesn't want the child just walking in, so you stop that.", "She can and did break it. \n\nAgain, very easily cleared up. \n\nNot her house.", "And tbh I'm not convinced the BIL isn't hiding behind the fiance. Also easily cleared up.\n\nWe've only got OPs account that BIL loves it. I'm guessing it was ok when he was alone. Things change. But who knows.", "OP asked her if she had spoken to her BIL about this and she has not. BIL is the owner of the home and the boy's uncle. If she has an issue with his nephew coming over then she needs to take it up with him. No one asked her to watch the boy. She can send him home if his uncle isn't there. OP isn't wrong to want to hear from the BIL 1st before altering a long standing agreement and possibly damaging the relationship between her son, BIL and maybe herself.", "> he totally could but its the fianc\u00e9 who has the problem in the first place so why would he hv this conversation with his bil when the fianc\u00e9 is clearly the one with a problem.\n\nBecause it doesn't matter what the brother says, she has a problem with it, she lives there, that's the end of it. If you don't feel comfortable with a 4yr old who randomly enters your home without warning when you might be going to pound town on the kitchen table then you have the right to say it's not okay for people to just walk in unannounced. \n\nWith some things you need both partners to agree, like for instance getting a dog/pet, buying a house, etc. For some things if either partner doesn't want it to happen, it's not happening even if the other partner is okay. A kid walking into your house unannounced is absolutely on the list of things that if either partner doesn't want it to happen it's veto'd.", "Well if he says - 'thats not my problem, you have the problem so deal with it' then he is essentially playing chicken with drama. With how easy it is to text someone, I dont see this as a hill to die on.\n\nHe may not have a problem now but she seems like a ticking time bomb if you dismiss her. Then he has a problem", "It\u2019s actually not. We don\u2019t know what the status of that home is. Whether he added her to the title if he owns the home or the lease if he rents it. She simply lives there because he\u2019s allowing her to do so. She has no legal claim to that home unless either one of the conditions listed above is met.", "this.", "She didn\u2019t break anything because it\u2019s not her agreement to break. Until she acts like an adult and stops trying to go behind BILs back with this rule, there isn\u2019t even any negotiation with the rule. \n\nThis also may be a reach but, it\u2019s not legally her house yet. So BIL can do whatever he pleases. It\u2019s not the right thing to do, but it\u2019s also not gonna help her case to go behind his back with stuff like this.", "Why are you not convinced? There\u2019s nothing signaling that the fianc\u00e9 is nervous. BIL has been doing this for awhile. OP seems more than willing to abide by the rule if the fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t play the backhand game.", "I don\u2019t disagree but again, she moved into his house and she hasn\u2019t had a conversation with him. if she wants the little boy to hv permission before he comes over she needs to talk to her fianc\u00e9 point blank period. he lived in the house before she did and thats the arrangement he has with his family so if she wants it to change then she needs to talk with the person she is living with.", "In the end OP should prob just text/ call BIL and tell him what fianc\u00e9 said and ask if he knew or what his thoughts are and just go from there bc i doubt the fianc\u00e9 will end up speaking to BIL ab it herself", "I assume you\u2019re in the US (\u201cmile\u201d). That\u2019s more a commentary on how ridiculously easy it is for someone in America to end up on those lists than it is an indication that your area is unsafe for kids.", "No, because people coming into your home without restriction is an imposition and disruptive.  Telling people to give you a heads up if they are coming is a common courtesy \u2014 this your comparison is without merit.\n\nShe is living there, she asked that the four year old no longer have unfettered access, 100% reasonable.  Maybe she want to walk around naked, or watch lien on the living room or just take a fucking nap", "It\u2019s completely irrelevant if she\u2019s on the title. She lives there. She has rights to boundaries.", "Her behaviour is also a big red flag and the BIL should notice this (once he\u2019s made aware of it).", "She has every right to decide she will not be forced to watch a four year old. Moving in doesn't make her OP's servant. If her kid wanders in while BIL isn't home, that's what going to be expected, isn't it? That she'll just babysit the kid without any warning, any pay or any consideration to if she might be sick, busy, have friends/family over, etc. So no, she has EVERY right to tell OP to knock it the fuck off.\n\nI'd call CPS the second that shit continued after telling her to knock it off, because I'm not going to be responsible for your fucking kid because you're too lazy to be a fucking parent.", "She's not immature. She's told her. Up front. More than OP is being. \n\nWhy is OP sending her kid over for her to be responsible for?? Not ok. \n\nNot OPs house so the rest is irrelevant. Very easy to sort out. As I said elsewhere, I'm not sure it is behind his back. But OP can fuck around and find out. She might find a for sale sign out the front soon.", "The BIL is hiding behind the fiance is what I can totally see being a possibility.\n\nOP is all BIL loves it and it's all great. But perhaps it isn't or isn't now. I can totally see the BIL and fiance having a conversation about how annoying it is but BIL doesn't know what to say to OP who has obvious difficulty reading a room. \n\nAnd the fiance says fuck it. I'll tell her. BiL doesn't want to deal with it. It's not don't tell BIL, it's actually he's pissed too but not forthright enough to deal with it. \n\nMaybe not but it's hardly a totally implausible possibility. \n\nI reckon they'll be moving soon. OP will blow it entirely. Fiance won't want to live next door to meddling Megan. Ugh. Who would.", "She really doesn't. I'm absolutely happy to fap to porn naked in my living room while I live alone. If I get a room mate in I'm not going to do that, I don't need to ask them if it's alright or not, it's just not. \n\nHe invited her to share his life with him, she might not have her name on the deed, that's for legal shit, he chose to share his life with her. That includes both allowing her to make decisions and making accommodations. It's completely unnecessary to talk to him, if your partner is uncomfortable having a child walking in to their house unnannouced that's as far as it goes.\n\nMore important if I as the father hear that someone in that house isn't comfortable with my kid walking in randomly then I'm going to stop the kid doing that immediately anyway because I can respect that she lives there and doesn't want it to happen. \n\nShe has full authority to make such a 'change' to her own house, the brother then has the ability to break up with her if it's some unreasonable thing and a deal breaker, OP doesn't have any right at all to dismiss or argue with the finance wanting something so basic as privacy in her home.", "I have the impression that it's fenced around the outside, they just removed it between their yards. We put a door between yards, too, but kept the perimeter fenced in.", "Seems like you are applying your fantasies and then assume your fantasies are true", "I've had a couple four year olds and my nieces have been four year olds. They ran between my backyard and my sister's front yard all the time. My house was directly in front of hers. There was no fence between our yards but there was a fence along the front of my house. In any case, they knew to go straight over. And 99.9% of the time, one of us was watching them make the walk. Plus, OP says nothing about not watching their kid walk over, just that he walks over alone", "Ridiculous because they don\u2019t think the finance should unilaterally introduce rules in a home that she shares with him that concern his family?? Wild", "Nope its not an imposition bc they were invited by BIL and its his HOME. He gave permission.\n\nNo she didnt. She TOLD OP that they had to ask first without consulting BIL. AND its something she knew happened and would continue to happen. \n\nAnd to that point what if BIL wanted to spend time with his family? Its 100% reasonable that BIL wamts to spend as much time as possible w his nephew since he lives so close.\n\n\nDid you ever stop and think that BIL lives there to be close to family?  Its insane obvious that BIL wants his nephew to feel like its like a second home and then fiamcee shows up and tries to put a stop to that", "Ohh she has every right and I even agree with her but she is going all wrong about that. She should first talk to her fiance and then they could together come with the solution.\n\nShe is the asshole about the approach but not for asking for privacy. \n\nSo I would say op NTA.", "No it's not. The BIL gave permission and encouraged it. If the fiance is against this then she needs to communicate this with her soon to be husband. Decisions like these require open communication between both partners.\n\nI do think the BIL fucked up if he didn't tell her about his nephew coming in and he should have told her. \n\nBut this isn't her sole decision to make. Cause what happens when they have a get together and the BIL asks hey how come nephew isn't coming over anymore? And family responds oh your fiance said she didn't want him over any more. \n\nYou don't see a fight ensuring because of this? It doesn't matter how valid her reason is. Maybe she's a nudist, maybe she doesn't want to be caught having sex with her soon to be husband. Or just values privacy.  All these are justified reasons but they still need to be conveyed to the soon to be husband.\n\nOr at the very least the family needs to talk with brother in law to see if he is still fine with his nephew coming over now that the living situation has change and thus he can start the communication with his soon to be wife.\n\nEither way it's not the soon to be wife's sole decision to make. It's hers and her soon to be husband. If their is disagreement then a compromise needs to be made. Bit that's for them to work out. Either way again it's not the soon to be wife's sole decision.", "nit without a open honest discussion with person who set up open door policy, there will definitely be objections raised. why didn't she address it with fiance first??? say hey since I'm moving in soon can we discuss new boundry/ guidelines for visits.... i mean they live next door and openly share backyard space for benefit of child  doesn't chg because just because she says.", "It\u2019s entirely relevant because if the owner of the house wants a guest there, their choice supersedes her boundaries. If for example she called the police to have someone removed from the house and the owner says they are a welcomed guest. What do you think the police are going to do?", "I never said she doesn\u2019t have the right to make decisions, but she has no right to make decisions about pre-existing agreements that affect BIL without including him. You\u2019re literally talking about things I NEVER said. She is not required to watch OPs child or be their servant, but she is required to BIL in conversation regarding their home. She had every right to set boundaries, but she has no right to set them without BIL in their SHARED space. \n\nCalling CPS because you decided to move in with someone with a pre-existing agreement involving a child, is absolutely insane. It\u2019s not like OP is dumping their kid on them without their consent, they had consent BEFORE the fianc\u00e9 moved in. They\u2019re not just gonna change it when the fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t even be truthful about it.", "She is immature. She might\u2019ve told OP but she went behind BILs back to enforce a rule that directly contradicts with the things he allows. OP doesn\u2019t need to be up front because they\u2019re not the one going behind BILs back.\n\nOP is sending their kid because BIL gave them his CONSENT to do so. That is ok. \n\nOnce again, it is relevant to OP because this is being brought to them. There is 110% nothing pointing to BIL hiding behind his fianc\u00e9. If he is, he is also immature and needs to reveal his feelings like an adult. The fianc\u00e9 is going to fuck around and find out if she keeps making rules about their house behind BILs back.", "Even if BIL is hiding behind his fianc\u00e9, that still wouldn\u2019t make OP the AH. If that is the case, then BIL and his fianc\u00e9 need to be adults and fess up to the fact that they don\u2019t want OPs son around all the time.\n\nHow is OP meddling over something that was BROUGHT TO THEM? That makes 0 sense. It\u2019s not OPs fault that they think the kid being over there is a positive experience, especially if BIL is not telling them otherwise. This all amounts to fianc\u00e9 and (on the off chance) BIL not being truthful about their feelings. OP isn\u2019t a mind reader.", "he may hv invited her to share his life with him but he might not for much longer when he learns that she is making decisions that impact them both without speaking to him first. if this were a healthy relationship she could go to her fianc\u00e9 and say something along the lines of \u201chey i think that it would be best if ur nephew asks for permission before coming over because I don\u2019t want to walk in on us being intimate in the house.\u201d And unless her fianc\u00e9 is completely unreasonable (in which case they hv other issues to deal with) he would most likely agree to this and either she or BIL could reach out to OP and tell him what they agreed upon. her moving into BIL\u2019s house does not give her free reign on all the decision making in the house especially without talking to her fianc\u00e9 first it literally isn\u2019t logical and is controlling asf.", "I have the impression 1fatsquirrel is 1fatkaren in real life and would call the cops for kids playing in their own yard without the parents right next to them.", "She has a right to privacy in her own home. JFC.", "Lol\u2014all the rules?  Again you\u2019re being ridiculous. She\u2019s asking for common courtesy they should not even be remotely controversial", "It\u2019s ridiculous because it\u2019s not a rule, it\u2019s common courtesy and respect.  \u201cplease ask before you let your 4 year old come to my home Every day\u201d. Not controversial, not disrespectful and not unreasonable.", "As she should.  One of the most common causes of divorce is intrusive and enmeshed families", "agreed. not an unreasonable request but partnership is literally ab doing and deciding on things together as partners and for some weird reason she isn\u2019t willing to do that.", "Read the  post,  she said nothing about not wanting the four-year-old to come over. She simply asked for the common courtesy of asking first. This is now her home, she could be napping, she could be showering, she could be prancing around in the living room naked with a dildo. She\u2019s asking for privacy and the simple courtesy of hey is it OK if my son comes over to say hi. She\u2019s also being put in the position of being the caretaker of a four year old that I presume she didn\u2019t sign up for", "this comment exactly.", "Well he doesnt have to worry about divorse, he can just kick her out bc ITS NOT HER HOUSE", "Exactly that's the main issue here.", "Doesn't matter, and yes I missed the without asking part when I first read it. But again it doesn't matter. She needs to have a discussion with her soon to be husband first and foremost. Or the family needs to get with both of them to have a discussion about this together. \n\nEither way it's not her sole decision. It was the BIL sole decision since it was made before she moved in and until a convo is had the prior decison is the current one to follow. And they should have had a convo about this at some point to establish boundaries. \n\nAgain I think she is valid in any excuse as long as it osnt some power play or territorial nonsense. But again this is a discussion she needs to make with her soon to be husband. They both need to be on board with it."]}
