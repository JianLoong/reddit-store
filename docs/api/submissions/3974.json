This is a nightmare waiting to happen. He should know that his fianc\u00e9e has been going behind his back discouraging his nephew from visiting unprompted - a habit that he has encouraged and supported to build their relationship - because he should know what kind of person she is. And his feelings on the matter need to be clarified anyway.", "In my opinion you are NTA this is a conversation that needs to happen with the BIL. I have a feeling that the BIL would not agree and she is trying to make you the bad guy in the situation.", "NAH. The fianc\u00e9e has a reasonable request and you have a valid request that you all get on the same page, especially since you probably don't want to change the rules on a 4-year-old too many times.", "ESH.  His situation has changed and he is not the only one living there.  You don't get to dismiss her wishes simply because they aren't yours.\n\nShe sucks because the first person she needed to speak to is her fiance.  Not you.  Him.  She didn't because she figured it would be easier to tell you no than risk a fight with her fiance.  How was she not aware that this was normal behavior as I can't imagine she just started coming around.\n\nHe sucks because when moving in together EVERYTHING needs to be discussed.  Seeing as your families are exceptionally close how is this not brought up?  If this was going to be an issue it should have been dealt with before moving in together.\n\nThe only one who doesn't suck is the 4 year old.", "NTA. From what I gather from your post it's your brother's house and he has a standing arrangement of allowing his nephew to drop in and visit which I think is super cute. I get that his fiance moving in means that it's her home too but she's coming off as really unpleasant and I agree with you that it should be up to your brother and not just her if your son stops by anymore. Also what kind of a lady wants to discourage a little boy from visiting his next door neighbor uncle? She's choosing a really negative way to begin this new phase of their relationship and doesn't seem to care about the feelings of a four year old boy and his mother which is not a good look for someone who is joining your family. Good luck with the situation she doesn't sound very friendly or fun.", "NTA. Talk to your BIL and get things straightened out. BIL can work out with his fiancee how to handle your son visiting going forward.", "NTA. Talk to your BIL ASAP and make sure everything is on yhe table..if ahe hasn't sponen to your BIL it's because she is trying to do an end run around him.", "NTA, her request is perfectly reasonable but it\u2019s weird she doesn\u2019t want your BIL involved in the conversation.", "YTA - but it\u2019s okay: you\u2019re all in a period of change right now. \n\nIf his fianc\u00e9 has moved in, that makes it her home too. You need her permission as well - not just your BILs. I know that\u2019s an adjustment - she\u2019s adjusting too - and there might be plenty of reasons why a couple might not want an unsupervised toddler roaming around their home. \n\nOP - do you really want your son to bust in on them mid-coitus? Or what about the fianc\u00e9\u2019s right to walk around naked in her own home?", "NTA. Sounds like she was trying to bypass your brother. In your place I would have spoken to brother as well as telling fiancee to talk to him.", "NTA. You had this agreement BEFORE she moved in and she should have talked to your BIL before bringing it up to you. She seems like she was trying to take control of the house but she is going about it completely wrong and it's causing or going to cause issues.", "YTA.  It is now her home too.  She has a right to decide who walks in unannounced.  Maybe she likes to cook naked?  Maybe she has breakable items she's worried he'll touch?  Maybe she's worried he'll get hurt and no one will know?  There are dozens of non-AH reasons for her to ask this.  You need to respect her decision on what to do in her own home.", "The fianc\u00e9e moved in. YTA because if one person who lives there is not ok with your 4 year old showing up unannounced you should not be letting him go over there. It is her house too. Do not send your child someplace where he isn\u2019t welcomed. He is four and needs you to watch out for him.", "NTA! But i think this fianc\u00e9 is going to be mean to your son if he goes over there while BIL isn\u2019t there and she is.", "YTA.  It's her home too now.  Your sons unannounced visits need to be cleared with both of them.", "YTA, it's a reasonable request, and if you want to talk to your BIL about it then you're more than welcome to. But she lives there too, and not having unannounced guests is a perfectly reasonable request to make", "That's your BIL home and until he says his nephew isn't free to come over whenever he wants then his fiance's wants can stand aside. NTA and good for you telling her to take this up with him. If she doesn't want his nephew, your son, to have open access then she can be the heavy and an adult by talking to BIL about it.", "NTA.  Sounds like she doesn't want to talk to BIL cause she knows he won't like it.  And thought you would just do it, making you look like the one cutting him from your son's life.  Talk to your BIL without his fiancee around.", "NTA\n\nOne, it's not her house. At the end of the day, it's BIL's house. If BIL wants to, he can send her packing at anytime.\n\nI wish people would stop thinking that you can change the rules in a house you don't own.\n\nTwo, she should be bringing this up with BIL, not bypassing to tell the wife of his nephew what she wants.\n\nThree, if she keeps this up, she's not going to have to worry about staying there for long.", "NTA.", "NTA", "YTA because it's her house now too. \n\nYou could just tell your BIL that she asked so that's why he won't be over as much. But you didn't so that makes me wonder. \n\nI'll await the AITA for letting my son just drop in on some adults when that goes badly. People should have privacy and space in their own homes. \n\nHe's not living alone anymore. Do you not see adjustments need to be made???", "YTA - KINDA\n\nIf he's decided to marry her and move her in, then she has a right to have a say in its comings and goings. There are new things to consider with a new person who deserves their personal space just as much as any of us. Would you want your son accidently walking in on her naked? Possibly walking in on some sexual activity? I get that your knee jerk reaction is to dump the decision on the brother in law here because you're not used to another person in the house to consider.  She has a right to personal space, and the time to get used to being there with new people/family. Maybe once she's comfortable and knows the routine more, she won't mind.", "YTA.  What makes you too good to talk to your BIL about it yourself?", "NAH, but you all need to have a conversation on boundaries.", "YTA. She lives there now and if she has a problem with your son being there then he can\u2019t be there. Simple as that. Please respect people\u2019s privacy. If your BIL wants to see your son he\u2019ll come over himself or ask you to keep letting him come over on his own accord", "YTA. Your BIL may have encouraged his little nephew to drop in whenever but it sounds like a dangerous practice to encourage kids to just walk into someone else\u2019s house.", "YTA- nothing wrong with your BIL\u2019s fianc\u00e9e that now lives there politely setting healthy boundaries. Not many people would appreciate unannounced drop in visits, even from a child, on a daily basis. If you can\u2019t respect her as an equal family member and her reasonable requests, it will be on YOU if they decide to move or set less polite boundaries", "YTA. It's her home now too and there could be lots of reasons she's not comfortable with this. You're right to not keep it a secret from BIL but you could have told your son to ask them first. That's good manners generally anyway. And you could have told her it's always been encouraged by BIL and suggested she get on the same page before then telling him yourself. Not ignoring her reasonable request unless it comes from BIL himself.", "YTA", "NAH, this is her home now too so she does have the right to make this request but I think that you should talk to your BIL and let him handle it.", "NTA\n\nBut it is time for a sit down conversation with the BIL and fiancee. I absolutely adore my niece and nephew. If I had this situation where they lived right next door, I couldn't imagine being with someone who would be upset with the kids visiting. \n\nHowever, if your bil's fiancee really feels this strongly about it and your bil is onboard with her feelings, then you have no choice but to respect the new boundaries. You may need to put up a fence as it will be really hard to explain to a 4 year old why they can't walk next door and see their uncle. \n\nThis is a sad situation. I don't have kids myself, however, if I was planning to marry someone and I was living right next door to their relative who had children, I would make every effort to get to know the children and not disrupt any arrangements that they have established.", "NTA / talk to BIL first.", "Esh", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Starting with fianc\u00e9. She should have communicated with her partner about how to handle your son popping in as he does. However, I absolutely see her point. You should give them some sort of notice before your son comes over. Or how about asking? It is also her house now, she lives there and should have a say in this. My mind goes to if they are doing you know what and oh wait there\u2019s a kid at the door again.\n\nYou, honestly probably because I\u2019m getting the vibe that you don\u2019t want anything to change. You should have a conversation with all three of you, your partner as well. When this conversation happens, do not go into it with the intention of having everything stay the same. It is beyond reasonable that they may want things to change.", "Esh. She has the right to deny your son entry but since this is an arrangement already in practice and encouraged by your BIL, she should've asked him to talk to you. You should follow her request and if BIL asks, you tell him why. It's simple as that. If there were 8 people were living there and even 1 said they weren't comfortable with someone coming over unannounced, then every has to respect that. Same logic here. But yeah, she should have to talked to her SO to talk to you.", "NAH but, maybe she\u2019s objecting to feeling like if he\u2019s there, she\u2019s responsible for him, and would prefer a heads up / are you prepared to do so kind of thing.

BIL needs to weigh in on it as well. Seems sus that fiancee doesn't want BIL involved", "But why didn't she bring it up to her SO and have him talk to HIS family instead of her butting in and trying to control everything. The BIL encourages the nephew coming over that's probably why she didn't want to talk to him in the first place so she's trying to go around him and end it with OP, even if it's not what BIL wants. \n\nAnd yes dozens of reasons but the way she went about it made her the A H not OP", "No.  It's her home too now.", "Because she didn't bring up the change of situation.

The fact that she is so willing to make a decision without talking to her fianc\u00e9 is already such a huge red flag, especially because it involves members of his family.
