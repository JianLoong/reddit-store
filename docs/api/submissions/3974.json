This is a nightmare waiting to happen. He should know that his fianc\u00e9e has been going behind his back discouraging his nephew from visiting unprompted - a habit that he has encouraged and supported to build their relationship - because he should know what kind of person she is. And his feelings on the matter need to be clarified anyway.", "In my opinion you are NTA this is a conversation that needs to happen with the BIL. I have a feeling that the BIL would not agree and she is trying to make you the bad guy in the situation.", "NAH. The fianc\u00e9e has a reasonable request and you have a valid request that you all get on the same page, especially since you probably don't want to change the rules on a 4-year-old too many times.", "ESH.

You don't get to dismiss her wishes simply because they aren't yours.\n\nShe sucks because the first person she needed to speak to is her fiance.  Not you.  Him.  She didn't because she figured it would be easier to tell you no than risk a fight with her fiance.  How was she not aware that this was normal behavior as I can't imagine she just started coming around.\n\nHe sucks because when moving in together EVERYTHING needs to be discussed.  Seeing as your families are exceptionally close how is this not brought up?  If this was going to be an issue it should have been dealt with before moving in together.\n\nThe only one who doesn't suck is the 4 year old.", "NTA. From what I gather from your post it's your brother's house and he has a standing arrangement of allowing his nephew to drop in and visit which I think is super cute. I get that his fiance moving in means that it's her home too but she's coming off as really unpleasant and I agree with you that it should be up to your brother and not just her if your son stops by anymore. Also what kind of a lady wants to discourage a little boy from visiting his next door neighbor uncle? She's choosing a really negative way to begin this new phase of their relationship and doesn't seem to care about the feelings of a four year old boy and his mother which is not a good look for someone who is joining your family.

Possibly walking in on some sexual activity? I get that your knee jerk reaction is to dump the decision on the brother in law here because you're not used to another person in the house to consider.  She has a right to personal space, and the time to get used to being there with new people/family. Maybe once she's comfortable and knows the routine more, she won't mind.", "YTA.  What makes you too good to talk to your BIL about it yourself?", "NAH, but you all need to have a conversation on boundaries.", "YTA.

Your BIL may have encouraged his little nephew to drop in whenever but it sounds like a dangerous practice to encourage kids to just walk into someone else\u2019s house.", "YTA- nothing wrong with your BIL\u2019s fianc\u00e9e that now lives there politely setting healthy boundaries. Not many people would appreciate unannounced drop in visits, even from a child, on a daily basis. If you can\u2019t respect her as an equal family member and her reasonable requests, it will be on YOU if they decide to move or set less polite boundaries", "YTA. It's her home now too and there could be lots of reasons she's not comfortable with this. You're right to not keep it a secret from BIL but you could have told your son to ask them first. That's good manners generally anyway. And you could have told her it's always been encouraged by BIL and suggested she get on the same page before then telling him yourself. Not ignoring her reasonable request unless it comes from BIL himself.", "YTA", "NAH, this is her home now too so she does have the right to make this request but I think that you should talk to your BIL and let him handle it.", "NTA\n\nBut it is time for a sit down conversation with the BIL and fiancee. I absolutely adore my niece and nephew. If I had this situation where they lived right next door, I couldn't imagine being with someone who would be upset with the kids visiting. \n\nHowever, if your bil's fiancee really feels this strongly about it and your bil is onboard with her feelings, then you have no choice but to respect the new boundaries. You may need to put up a fence as it will be really hard to explain to a 4 year old why they can't walk next door and see their uncle. \n\nThis is a sad situation. I don't have kids myself, however, if I was planning to marry someone and I was living right next door to their relative who had children, I would make every effort to get to know the children and not disrupt any arrangements that they have established.", "NTA / talk to BIL first.", "Esh", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Respect the boundary that she\u2019s requested of you.  Yeah, your FOUR YEAR OLD should NOT have open access to their home!  Eventually they will marry and probably have kids of their own, do you want these cousins to be close or do you want them to move further away from you?   Do you want a friend and ally in this woman or do you want difficulty and disconnect?  Listen to her when she makes a reasonable request. \n\nAlso, to commenters saying IT\u2019S HIS HOUSE/ SHE\u2019S NOT HIS WIFE YET!  She has no rights and no say!  You don\u2019t know her personal financial situation, I feel that if she was some kind of gold digger OP would have mentioned it.  She may have sold or rented out her home, she may have other assets that BIL will benefit from.", "You, the parent of the child, are okay with it. Your brother in law, the person being 'intruded' on, is okay with it. It sounds like he already has permission. NTA.", "NTA, like others pointed out it\u2019s troubling that she\u2019s hiding the whole thing from your brother-in-law.", "NTA- she needs to tell your BIL first if she is uncomfortable with your son popping over. I think the fact she's making rules without even telling him is shady. It's her home now too but it's still something they should be on the same page about.", "NTA- You need to tell your Brother in Law about it. His Fiancee sounds very controlling and is way out of line.", "ESH She lives there. She can say she doesn't want your kid there. But, the THREE, 4 if you have your child there, of you talking about this is the adult thing to do.", "I was torn between N A H and YTA, but tbh I'm gonna go with you as the asshole in this situation. Yes this has been the norm for y'all, but she's not being unreasonable. I would hate it if a toddler/kindergartener had free roam to enter my backyard or home. It feels unsafe and what if I'm not prepared to care for a kid at that moment? They're too young for that imo. This is a great opportunity to teach your son about boundaries.\n\nTbf I don't think you're being a bad parent or anything. You were caught off guard and changes are happening. But it's a reasonable request and I think your child's safety should factor into this.\n\nEdit: spelling.", "Agreee. It\u2019s not UNreasonable to ask even a close relative to call before dropping by. Even more so if you, like many others, appreciate the opportunity to do non-child friendly things in the privacy of your own home. \n\nI feel like OP sees this as a pissing contest to assert dominance as the HBIC of uncle\u2019s house when it\u2019s really the most natural request ever. It wouldn\u2019t have to even be made; I\u2019d have already told my kid or at least waylaid him as he was leaving the house to make a call next door first. I can\u2019t imagine OP doesn\u2019t know when her kid bops next door, and if she doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s an issue too.", "This is my thought, fianc\u00e9e only sounds slightly suspicious with not having talked to the uncle about it yet, but it sounds like it might very easily be solved by having a talk with everyone", "Talk to him with the fianc\u00e9 there so she understands everything will always be handled with transparency. You will not do that talking behind anyone's back..So \"'SIL' asked that 'son' not drop in anymore. I just want you to know that we respect your wishes as a couple and wouldn't want you to ever be inconvenienced...\"", "The bil eats lunch and dinner everyday at OP\u2019s house ? NTA since the child often calls him for said meals also. If that has changed , the bil should make the request himself and not the fianc\u00e9 behind his back.", "OP didn't dismiss her wishes though they just wanted to make sure the BIL was made aware of it by the person making the request. OP never said I refuse to stop my son they just said you should talk to my BIL about it first. As long as BIL was made aware and was on the same page as fiance OP has no problem with it.", "Since she is just moving in, that to me says it is his house first and foremost. She needs to set the ground rules with the BIL, not with OP. If BIL has the rule the kid can come over any time, the kid can come over anytime, and until the BIL says he can\u2019t come over, then the kid can. \n\n\nI would absolutely talk with BIL before I told the kid he could go over. That way he knows what he is getting into.", "> You don't get to dismiss her wishes simply because they aren't yours.\n\nreally don't see how that's happening here", "Sorry, the four year old is definitely TA in this case.", "This 100%. \n\nI also may be the crazy one, but I don\u2019t think the the fianc\u00e9e should have had to talk to the BIL first.

BUT, OP isn't wrong that BIL (the homeowner/renter) should be involved in the discussion. The two should've come to a consensus on the request before ever involving OP. The fact he doesn't even know yet is sus.", "Every single reason you gave is plausible but according to OP not a single one of those reasons are why she's doing this so for the sake of the argument none of those are why she made the request.\n\n If she had even one of the valid reasons that you gave, there's absolutely no reason why she couldn't just talk to her fiance and explain her side and they put a stop to the nephew visiting as a couple. The fact that not only did she NOT do that but she's trying to avoid the BIL being brought into the conversation altogether gives the notion that she just wants what she wants and thinks she should have it without any rhyme or reason but she understands that that's wrong which is why she doesn't want BIL to know about the request. \n\nYes it's her home too but if theyre going to get married then that's going to be her nephew too and for no rhyme or reason  she has unilaterally decided that her future nephew is not allowed to come over whenever he wants to see his uncle anymore.", "\n\"If your BIL wants to see your son he\u2019ll come over himself or ask you to keep letting him come over on his own accord\"\n\nBut according to the post the fiance never spoke to BIL about this so he would have no reason as to why his nephew suddenly isn't coming over anymore. If the fiancee wasn't willing to bring it up with him initially I highly doubt she's going to confess that she's the reason the nephew doesn't come over anymore. \n\nHow is that first conversation supposed to go btw?\n\nOP: \"hey BIL is it alright if my son comes over to hang out?\"\n\nBIL: \"of course it's alright you don't have to ask he always just comes over?\"\n\nOP: \"your fiancee told me that I have to ask for permission before he can come over from now on so I'm just trying to be respectful of her wishes\"\n\nBIL: \"she never said anything to me about this, I'll talk to her\"\n\nFight ensues about why she went behind his back and told OP nephew isn't allowed to come over like he used to.", "Exactly. Who lets a 4 year old wander unsupervised between houses?\n\nI mean you know where they are and keep an eye on them until \u201cUncle\u201d has answered his nephews call. \n\nHe is 4, not 9!", "I like this, but want to clarify something I think you mean and I definitely think. just make sure it's not in front of the little guy too, as I'm guessing a few would take that as 'true transparency' but might actually come off as 'pushy and guilting'", "How very Reddit of you to accuse a complete stranger of \"malicious interpretation\", LOL. (Sorry, I actually don't mean to mock you, I'm just laughing because if you knew me you'd know that I'm normally the person who gives everyone the benefit of the doubt, so this is actually making me giggle for real . . . )\n\nAnd you know, under other circumstances I would probably agree with you. But under THESE circumstances I have to think that you're either very naive or you haven't read the original post very carefully. Because the fianc\u00e9e came to OP in the most disingenuous, sneaky way possible. She wasn't simply \"looking for privacy\" or she would have handled this openly and aboveboard. Heck, she wouldn't have come to OP at all if she were looking for privacy. \n\nShe would have gone to her fianc\u00e9. The one who lives with her, and loves her, and whose arrangement this was in the first place. Theoretically, if she were seeking privacy, she needn't have left her own house to arrange it.\n\nBut I suspect that she either DID go to her fianc\u00e9, and he refused to put an end to the arrangement because it's important to him . . . or she knows that he will refuse or be hurt or upset if she goes to him. So she did a sneaky end run around him, which implies malice on HER part, interfering with his relationship with his nephew in a manner that he would neither want nor agree to if she approached him directly. \n\nSo you see, there was no malice inherent in my interpretation at all. Only experience with disingenuous people who like to get their way . . . and recognition of the fact that there was really no reason why she needed to go to OP in the first place unless she was up to something.", "Also that she said that he shouldn't have to talk to BIL because SHE told you to not let him come.", "I agree.  If she lives there, she has a say, without her BIL, about whether a 4 yo she barely knows comes in unannounced and unprompted. BIL has been ok with it but if she\u2019s not, she\u2019s not. And yes I have kids. We used to have a neighbor kid come over all the time like this, I didn\u2019t like it Even though  I liked him and his family.", "Definitely, I wouldn't put it past the fiance to take it upon herself to tell the 4 year old he isn't allowed and cause all sorts of issues.", "It\u2019s also a YTA for allowing a four year old to wander around unsupervised in the first place. But yes, the bil should be involved in the discussion.", "No ? What on earth was that ? That\u2019s not what I suggested at all. \nOp keeps her child at home, she said in the post her son is always over there unless his uncle is at her house which suggests that BIL does visit op so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s cutting him off \n\nIf BIL wants to see her son at home he\u2019ll say \u201c hey why is your son not coming by anymore? \u201c \nAnd op will be like \u201cofc he can come by if you and your fianc\u00e9 are okay with it\u201d\n\nAnd when he says yes.

My guess is the \"unsupervised\" walk consists of walking from the back door of his house to the back door of the uncle's house, probably with the parent watching the whole time.  \n\nIn any event, best to get ahead of this issue.  Get the BIL and fiance together and inquire about the request.  If they agree that it needs to stop, so be it, but that's a discussion they need to have.", "No. Not in front of 4 yr old. In front of all the adults. This way sil stops the 'you need to respect me' nonsense.", "We 100% know that based on the story.

But she has a responsibility to be honest and upfront with ALL parties involved in such request and she's being unnecessarily sneaky about it.", "It's less about a right to privacy and more the fact that she's trying to make a decision that affects both of them without his input. It's just as much his house as it is hers so she needs to talk to OP's BIL.

She wants the kid to stop going over, but doesn\u2019t want to admit to her fianc\u00e9 that that\u2019s what she wants.

There has probably been times where they didn't answer the door because they were busy or something. Of course they're allowed to say whatever but that's not what happened.
