This is a nightmare waiting to happen. He should know that his fianc\u00e9e has been going behind his back discouraging his nephew from visiting unprompted - a habit that he has encouraged and supported to build their relationship - because he should know what kind of person she is. And his feelings on the matter need to be clarified anyway.", "In my opinion you are NTA this is a conversation that needs to happen with the BIL. I have a feeling that the BIL would not agree and she is trying to make you the bad guy in the situation.", "NAH. The fianc\u00e9e has a reasonable request and you have a valid request that you all get on the same page, especially since you probably don't want to change the rules on a 4-year-old too many times.", "ESH.  His situation has changed and he is not the only one living there.  You don't get to dismiss her wishes simply because they aren't yours.\n\nShe sucks because the first person she needed to speak to is her fiance.  Not you.  Him.  She didn't because she figured it would be easier to tell you no than risk a fight with her fiance.  How was she not aware that this was normal behavior as I can't imagine she just started coming around.\n\nHe sucks because when moving in together EVERYTHING needs to be discussed.  Seeing as your families are exceptionally close how is this not brought up?  If this was going to be an issue it should have been dealt with before moving in together.\n\nThe only one who doesn't suck is the 4 year old.", "NTA. From what I gather from your post it's your brother's house and he has a standing arrangement of allowing his nephew to drop in and visit which I think is super cute. I get that his fiance moving in means that it's her home too but she's coming off as really unpleasant and I agree with you that it should be up to your brother and not just her if your son stops by anymore. Also what kind of a lady wants to discourage a little boy from visiting his next door neighbor uncle? She's choosing a really negative way to begin this new phase of their relationship and doesn't seem to care about the feelings of a four year old boy and his mother which is not a good look for someone who is joining your family.

Possibly walking in on some sexual activity? I get that your knee jerk reaction is to dump the decision on the brother in law here because you're not used to another person in the house to consider.  She has a right to personal space, and the time to get used to being there with new people/family. Maybe once she's comfortable and knows the routine more, she won't mind.", "YTA.  What makes you too good to talk to your BIL about it yourself?", "NAH, but you all need to have a conversation on boundaries.", "YTA.

Your BIL may have encouraged his little nephew to drop in whenever but it sounds like a dangerous practice to encourage kids to just walk into someone else\u2019s house.", "YTA- nothing wrong with your BIL\u2019s fianc\u00e9e that now lives there politely setting healthy boundaries. Not many people would appreciate unannounced drop in visits, even from a child, on a daily basis. If you can\u2019t respect her as an equal family member and her reasonable requests, it will be on YOU if they decide to move or set less polite boundaries", "YTA. It's her home now too and there could be lots of reasons she's not comfortable with this. You're right to not keep it a secret from BIL but you could have told your son to ask them first. That's good manners generally anyway. And you could have told her it's always been encouraged by BIL and suggested she get on the same page before then telling him yourself. Not ignoring her reasonable request unless it comes from BIL himself.", "YTA", "NAH, this is her home now too so she does have the right to make this request but I think that you should talk to your BIL and let him handle it.", "NTA\n\nBut it is time for a sit down conversation with the BIL and fiancee. I absolutely adore my niece and nephew. If I had this situation where they lived right next door, I couldn't imagine being with someone who would be upset with the kids visiting. \n\nHowever, if your bil's fiancee really feels this strongly about it and your bil is onboard with her feelings, then you have no choice but to respect the new boundaries. You may need to put up a fence as it will be really hard to explain to a 4 year old why they can't walk next door and see their uncle. \n\nThis is a sad situation. I don't have kids myself, however, if I was planning to marry someone and I was living right next door to their relative who had children, I would make every effort to get to know the children and not disrupt any arrangements that they have established.", "NTA / talk to BIL first.", "Esh", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They share a backyard without a fence, sounds pretty safe, especially if the child has been doing this for a long time and all responsible adults are aware and at home even if they're not directly holding his hand.", "Ir wouldn't have occurred to me that I needed permission to ask for privacy in my home. However once OP asked the question I would have said \"No I hadn't talked to him but will be doing so immediately.\" NAH.", "Esp since its not her house", "If he wants his brothers confirmation why is he asking her to get it? Apparently he comes over daily so he could just ask him or even just a text, could avoid drama.", "I\u2019m thinking the same thing, she\u2019s doing this behind his back because he probably already told her that his nephew has access whenever he wants to come over.", "I think the issue op had was that the fianc\u00e9 wanted to keep it secret. If my siblings significant other asked me to stop doing something that seems to make my sibling happy and keep why secret from them I would insist on telling them like op. \n\nWanting privacy from a 4 year understandable, wanting to change some big part of your significant others life, not tell them and ask others to keep it a secret less understandable more red flag", "She has a say but if BIL says \"no, this is my lifestyle and how I relate to my family\", then she needs to be upfront about it and either accept it or not. The setup sounds like a multi-generational compound of sorts where they share meals and hangout a lot. \n\nIt's not her home yet.", "But he is the one to request nephew visits him whenever, op isn't purposefully sending her kid there unprompted, since uncle was the one to request it first it is a conversation they need to have among themselves first and the fiance needs to learn that now that they live together is no longer her house her rules but he has to speak with her partner to reach an arrangement that works for both, something that OP has suggested she will stick to once it's presented as a united front.", "Me too - lol", "Aware is supervised!", "Yeah except my concern would be if the kid actually disappears nobody is likely to notice for how long? Uncle will just think the kid is home and parents will just think kid is at the uncles.", "Also, 4 year old may have to have it explained why he's suddenly no longer welcome to visit his uncle when he has been able to do so independently.  Independence is very important to developing children.  \n\nBTW, we were in and out of cousins and grandma's house all the time as very young kids and would go get a cup of sugar or some condiment mom needed for a meal.  If the inside door was closed or the curtains were closed, we knocked.  If they were open, we gave a quick knock and walked in.  Our friends and family did the same at our house.  \n\nWe, unfortunately, don't live in the same kind of world.", "She lives there now, it\u2019s her home. She gets a say in what she\u2019s comfortable with. A FOUR year old is just walking next door and going into his uncle\u2019s house? That alone sounds dangerous but more so is instilling some bad habits as he grows older- you can\u2019t just suddenly enforce a boundary when he ages up a bit when you\u2019ve let him do what he wants his whole life up until that point.\n\nEta: ESH to the OP. I get the hesitation and I don\u2019t like that the fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t consult your BIL first but like, I\u2019m uncomfortable with just letting a small child do what they want unattended in a neighborhood where anything can happen.", "It is now her HOME", "he totally could but its the fianc\u00e9 who has the problem in the first place so why would he hv this conversation with his bil when the fianc\u00e9 is clearly the one with a problem. it seems that if bil agrees with the fianc\u00e9 that OP would agree to hv his son ask before going over so again i don\u2019t think this conversation is his problem bc the fianc\u00e9 is the one who suggested it in the first place and should be the one to bring it up with the bil. Its the BILs house anyway and she moved into his home so if she has a problem with the way his nephew has access to his house that\u2019s definitely a conversation that should be had between the two of them", "She doesn't have a right to change a routine without consulting the home owner. Why would she not speak to him first? She probably already did and he said he didn't want to stop.", "Nothing in the post indicates she wanted or planned to keep the request a secret. She just told OP what her boundaries around her own house are. and anyway the situation that was working for BIL while he was living there alone has been changed. They may be having sex, she may have delicate or breakable things she brought to the house, she may simply not be cool yet with babysitting at any time the kid might be awake with no notice.. all reasonable Reasons to change this. OP is welcome to discuss with both of them more but I still think if I am not comfortable about something in my home, it\u2019s my right to set that boundary. She is right that she doesn\u2019t need BIL\u2019s permission to do so. anyway, this will eventually come out no matter what when the kid is no longer showing up unannounced.", "What? How long does she have to live there before it is her home? That\u2019s nuts. \n\nThis is a two yes, one no situation.", "That's a good point. A kid walking a few steps through the backyard when their respective adults are aware is a huge difference to a kid wandering out of the house and hopping next door without anyone knowing! \n\n(My kid growing up we lived in a rural farming village where my in laws lived next door and it was similarly walking across the backyard to get to their house, and there were cousins living down the block about 6 houses away - all the family kids just played outside and wandered between houses and backyards all the time. We were all aware where they were and what they're doing)", "He's not \"roaming the neighbourhood\", OP clearly states that they have no fence between backyards so nephew doesn't leave his yard.", "Dunno, the kid is going through the backyard not out into the neighborhood.... at least it appears to be that way as he talks about the backyard a bit.", "That\u2019s true. Even if he is just going to his uncle\u2018s, no telling what could happen. In the US, a 7yr old girl was abducted & murdered by a FedEx driver. And people would be so surprised at the registered sex offenders in the area. I live in a rural area & there was over 20 registered sex offenders within a 20 mile radius.", "She has no stake in the home. He owns it, her name is on nothing. If its what BIL wants, its up to her to discuss it w BIL. Not make an end all be all house hold rule without talking to the actual homeowner. If something happens to the kid, esp bc she caused it, its BIL\u2019s insurance and money that will be paying for bc (again) its not her house.", "Wow. Roaming around a neighborhood. \nI don't know where you are from, but luckily children around here get some modicum of freedom so they can learn (take the bus, go to school, go to  a bakery to buy bread, etc). \nGoing to your neighbors house, if both adults agree, is not roaming.\n\nAnd at 4 he is clearly capable of going next door and not leaving his yard", "it may be her home now but it still is her fiance's as well. She is unilaterally making decisions that effect her fiance, her fiance's  brother and her fiance's nephew without consulting him or even informing him. This is a huge control issue and a very large red flag. I do agree that OP has to comply with her wishes but he very much needs to discuss it with his brother ASAP.", "Then tell me about the reverse scenario\n\nFiancee owns the house next to OP, that couldve been how her and BIL met. BIL moves into fiancees home, being neighbors w OP, BIL tells 4YO yhat he may come and go as he pleases without discussing w fiancee.\n\nBy your logic thats fine bc its his house too bc its his HOME", "She lives there, but she doesn\u2019t own it.", "Agree 100%, but I would add that it was his home first. She moved in, but she's not the wife yet, and so it's not her house. Everything to do with the nephew continuing to follow a precedence already set of the routine about \"visiting\" Uncle is still Uncle's call, NOT hers.", "Same. We lived in the country and then when in the suburbs we played with the kids up the lane way!\n\nOur parents were always aware of where we were\n\nMy niece goes in between mine and my brothers house. We are separated by a laneway between streets. He can see down the laneway and I can stand out the front and see the bottom of the laneway. \n\nQuick call and I would step out and watch while she walked alone until she was about 7-8. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why a text is bad if you aware of where you kid is going\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want the responsibility of an unsupervised 4 year old walking straight in my house. I could be moving a boiling pot of water, checking a boil on my bum in the mirror. Lol. So many things a 4 year old should be shielded from. \n\nA text and knock isn\u2019t a big ask.", "Have you met a four year old? There\u2019s no telling what could happen or what may distract them away from the back door to back door route they usually take or what creep may be looking for an opportunity to snatch him. I wish we lived in a world where these weren\u2019t concerns, but assuming OP lives in the states, they need to be a lot more thoughtful about letting their kid go outside alone in a yard that\u2019s not fenced.", "Dude. She moved into the home of the person she is going to marry. It doesn\u2019t matter if her name is on the deed, she has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a say in what happens there now that she lives in the house. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s an actual relationship and not a dictatorship; she is well within her rights to set boundaries. Obviously she should have talked to him about it first but no reasonable adult would be comfortable with a child that isn\u2019t theirs coming and going as they please in their house.", "You\u2019re ridiculous", "It doesn\u2019t matter it\u2019s now her home no differently than if you rent, it may not be your property but it is your home. \n\nShe has every right to ask that she be made aware when a 4 year old or 30 year old is going to come into her home. I can\u2019t imagine anybody objecting to that. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous and entitled to think otherwise", "A text and a knock isn't a big ask at all, but the other party in question is totally fine without it and encourages the kid to visit any time, so it's no problem.\n\nOP and the brother need to have a conversation about this moving forward since the fiancee clearly isn't okay with it. Pretty simple solution for grown ups who are responsible and reasonable enough to supervise a 4 year old between houses, IMO. Could be as simple as fiancee isn't aware, or doesn't yet know the kid well enough to feel confident if she's responsible for him. No need for this to be drama at all.", "Then tell me about the reverse scenario\n\nFiancee owns the house next to OP, that couldve been how her and BIL met. BIL moves into fiancees home, being neighbors w OP, BIL tells 4YO yhat he may come and go as he pleases without discussing w fiancee.\n\nBy your logic thats fine bc its his house too bc he now lives there", "Finacee or not id never move into someones house and immediately assume i could make rules changing something theyve specifically set up. Theyre fucking engaged. She KNEW this was something that happened on a daily basis. She didnt talk to him about it before, now shes making this unilateral decision without discussing it. Its not her property, she does not get to decide who comes and goes. He can compromise and agree with her on the matter, but in the end he is the homeowner, its his insurance, he is solely liable.", "So, the fianc\u00e9 moves in and suddenly she gets to make all the rules without discussing them with her intended?", "Then why isn\u2019t she talking to her partner about it? That would have been the right move. They are supposedly partners. I wonder if he already said no to her boundaries and she\u2019s trying to go around him. Her boundaries are entirely fair, but really should be discussed with her partner not the somewhat in laws.", "Yeah well OP and BIL plus BIL and fianc\u00e9e!\n\nIt really doesn\u2019t seem like it should be a big deal. My niece is welcome here at anytime. She has her own room. No one could tell me she wouldn\u2019t be welcome. \n\nBut I think you\u2019re right just be adults and use the novelty thing of having a conversation", "She shouldn\u2019t have made a unilateral decision, we agree on this. But it is now her home and she does get a say who comes and goes.", "She should say this to her fiance (BL) so this can be resolved once and for all.", "Not when that say is in direct contradiction to the owner. She needs to speak to him first, full stop."]}
