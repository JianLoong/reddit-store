This is a nightmare waiting to happen. He should know that his fianc\u00e9e has been going behind his back discouraging his nephew from visiting unprompted - a habit that he has encouraged and supported to build their relationship - because he should know what kind of person she is. And his feelings on the matter need to be clarified anyway.", "In my opinion you are NTA this is a conversation that needs to happen with the BIL. I have a feeling that the BIL would not agree and she is trying to make you the bad guy in the situation.", "NAH. The fianc\u00e9e has a reasonable request and you have a valid request that you all get on the same page, especially since you probably don't want to change the rules on a 4-year-old too many times.", "ESH.  His situation has changed and he is not the only one living there.  You don't get to dismiss her wishes simply because they aren't yours.\n\nShe sucks because the first person she needed to speak to is her fiance.  Not you.  Him.  She didn't because she figured it would be easier to tell you no than risk a fight with her fiance.  How was she not aware that this was normal behavior as I can't imagine she just started coming around.\n\nHe sucks because when moving in together EVERYTHING needs to be discussed.  Seeing as your families are exceptionally close how is this not brought up?  If this was going to be an issue it should have been dealt with before moving in together.\n\nThe only one who doesn't suck is the 4 year old.", "NTA. From what I gather from your post it's your brother's house and he has a standing arrangement of allowing his nephew to drop in and visit which I think is super cute. I get that his fiance moving in means that it's her home too but she's coming off as really unpleasant and I agree with you that it should be up to your brother and not just her if your son stops by anymore. Also what kind of a lady wants to discourage a little boy from visiting his next door neighbor uncle? She's choosing a really negative way to begin this new phase of their relationship and doesn't seem to care about the feelings of a four year old boy and his mother which is not a good look for someone who is joining your family. Good luck with the situation she doesn't sound very friendly or fun.", "NTA. Talk to your BIL and get things straightened out.

Possibly walking in on some sexual activity? I get that your knee jerk reaction is to dump the decision on the brother in law here because you're not used to another person in the house to consider.  She has a right to personal space, and the time to get used to being there with new people/family. Maybe once she's comfortable and knows the routine more, she won't mind.", "YTA.  What makes you too good to talk to your BIL about it yourself?", "NAH, but you all need to have a conversation on boundaries.", "YTA.

Your BIL may have encouraged his little nephew to drop in whenever but it sounds like a dangerous practice to encourage kids to just walk into someone else\u2019s house.", "YTA- nothing wrong with your BIL\u2019s fianc\u00e9e that now lives there politely setting healthy boundaries. Not many people would appreciate unannounced drop in visits, even from a child, on a daily basis. If you can\u2019t respect her as an equal family member and her reasonable requests, it will be on YOU if they decide to move or set less polite boundaries", "YTA. It's her home now too and there could be lots of reasons she's not comfortable with this. You're right to not keep it a secret from BIL but you could have told your son to ask them first. That's good manners generally anyway. And you could have told her it's always been encouraged by BIL and suggested she get on the same page before then telling him yourself. Not ignoring her reasonable request unless it comes from BIL himself.", "YTA", "NAH, this is her home now too so she does have the right to make this request but I think that you should talk to your BIL and let him handle it.", "NTA\n\nBut it is time for a sit down conversation with the BIL and fiancee. I absolutely adore my niece and nephew. If I had this situation where they lived right next door, I couldn't imagine being with someone who would be upset with the kids visiting. \n\nHowever, if your bil's fiancee really feels this strongly about it and your bil is onboard with her feelings, then you have no choice but to respect the new boundaries. You may need to put up a fence as it will be really hard to explain to a 4 year old why they can't walk next door and see their uncle. \n\nThis is a sad situation. I don't have kids myself, however, if I was planning to marry someone and I was living right next door to their relative who had children, I would make every effort to get to know the children and not disrupt any arrangements that they have established.", "NTA / talk to BIL first.", "Esh", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you don't feel comfortable with a 4yr old who randomly enters your home without warning when you might be going to pound town on the kitchen table then you have the right to say it's not okay for people to just walk in unannounced. \n\nWith some things you need both partners to agree, like for instance getting a dog/pet, buying a house, etc. For some things if either partner doesn't want it to happen, it's not happening even if the other partner is okay.

The fianc\u00e9 is her neighbour and its now her home too. It's not about whose family it is. It's about entering unannounced someone's home and if 1 person of a household isn't ok with that, it should be respected. It's so strange how everyone is so caught up with whose name is on the title of the house or whose family it is instead of seeing the fianc\u00e9 as a human being of her own. \n\nNow put yourself in the shoes of the fianc\u00e9e. You move into a house with the love of your life. It's now your home. But you can't expect any boundaries in your house unless your husband approves and announces them to others first. You'd run from that family as fast as you can, wouldn't you. \n\nAnd I don't see this as her being sneaky. I see her having a problem and her trying to solve that problem herself. That's what adults do. OP doesn't see women as equal but as someone who needs a man's approval to set her own boundaries. She's not asking anything unreasonable. She doesn't hate thr child or doesn't want the child ever to visit. She just want heads up.", "My thoughts exactly. I would think she is more likely to come back in a hour and say talked to the BIL while in reality she didnt", "Then she talks to her fianc\u00e9, the one who allows and encourages it. Just because you move into a house doesn\u2019t mean you dictate everything unilaterally without discussion.", "Dunno about that. Of the three men that raped me as a child, only one went onto be on a list.\n\nAnd one of the others got caught flashing his genitals to a small child.", "And that makes sense but how she went about it was an AH way.  She should have talked to her fiance and said \u201choney I know you love your nephew but lets talk to his parents about having him give us a heads up from now on instead of just walking in\u201d rather than going to nephews parent behind her fiances back.  The desire for privacy isn\u2019t the problem.", ">She has every right to ask that she be made aware when a 4 year old or 30 year old \n\nRight, so why hasn't she asked her partner to change the terms of the invitation to a 4 year old? Why is she going behind her partners back to carry out her rights? Why is she not speaking to the one person who has joint control over 'her home'?", "This isn't everything she's just asking they give a heads up before he turns up as she lives there, and it prevents kiddo seeing things he shouldn't", "That is not at all how this works.", "I'm not sure what you don't understand about this being OPs kid and their house.

And it totally is. \n\nAnd what happens if the kids has an accident? \n\nNo boundaries OP is a walking red flag for massive trouble ahead if it's not nipped in the bud now.

I'm not convinced she went behind BILs back. I don't think it's likely. \n\nIt's OPs version. Not relevant anyway. \n\nIt's OPs kid. It's their house. \n\nAnd as I have said numerous times, she can address that very very easily.

NO ONE is saying that the fianc\u00e9\u2019s request is unreasonable, but she is going about it the wrong way by not telling BIL. \n\nNo one wants to be in the middle of one partner being untruthful to the other.

OP would 100% be the AH of it weren\u2019t so clear that the fianc\u00e9 is going behind BILs back to ask for this.  \n\nNo one is demonizing the fianc\u00e9, it\u2019s just blatantly obvious that she\u2019s not being truthful with BIL. \n\nOP is not violating boundaries. Her BIL is ok with the kid coming over. If he wasn\u2019t, then OP would be violating them, but they\u2019re not.

Not taking the responsibility of solving THEIR home issues that the fianc\u00e9 went behind BILs back about? OP didn\u2019t do that because it\u2019s not their responsibility to cover up or reveal fianc\u00e9 going behind BILs back.

You are adults, right?  So, freakin talk to each other.  You are right that the fianc\u00e9 should talk to your BIL about the situation and why she feels the way she does.  Honestly, if I was home  alone, I would not want anyone just coming over when they please.  Now, why I say all esh?  Because I can guarantee you that once that little four year just goes over anytime he wants to, pops in and comes back home telling you that he saw BIL and fianc\u00e9 in their birthday suits playing leap frog in the living room, that all of a sudden, now all the adults involved will want to have a discussion on boundaries.", "NTA but you handled it a bit roughly. Should be more \"of course if the current arrangement no longer works for the two of you we can reassess, but son is 4 and needs one set of rules. So rather than uncle saying one thing and you another, we all need to chat together to agree new rules and boundaries that son can follow. As he hasn't done anything wrong its important he doesn't perceive this as arbitrary punishment. And we don't want him to think uncle doesn't love him any more now that you're on the scene.

Also, what if they spontaneously want to have mid-day sex in the living room? I mean it\u2019s their house and they just started living together. So requesting privacy is reasonable change. \n\nOn the other hand, I think it would have been more tactful for her to speak to her fianc\u00e9 first, for the sake open communication and easing her way into the family, rather than making demands. \n\nI\u2019m going to go with NTA.", "ESH.
