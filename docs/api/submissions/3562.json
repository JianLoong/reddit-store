Another example of people 18 and over are by no means \"adult\". \nI go with EAH - as friends you're supposed to lift each other up, help each other and be kind. Not try to compete in front of others and making the other seem small. Since he seems to have started that behaviour and you're only reacting, I wouldn't call you the sole AH here. Also - saying that what you did was worse than anything he did might be HIS opinion to make HIM look better. By no means does that have to be the actual truth. It DOES look to me as if he is the \"leader\" in your friendship - but not in a good way. You should speak up for yourself and reconsider that friendship.", "ESH.
