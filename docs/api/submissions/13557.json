My dad didn't want to be married anymore. But they have kept a friendly relationship over the years, my dad comes to some holidays, etc. My mom has been dating her bf for over 10 years.\n\nHowever, I could tell my mom was not over my dad. The comments she makes to me about the divorce and how sad she was, how she wishes she was still married, the horrible way she treats her bf, she is always nasty to him and refuses to move in with him....I just had a feeling even though she didn't directly admit it. Until last week.\n\nLast week during my sister's birthday dinner after a few drinks my mom suddenly said she has not gotten over nor will she ever get over our dad leaving. She said she would take her old life back in a second. She said she wants us to tell him all that when he is on his death bed. My sister and I were like WTF? She said fine tell him when I am on \\*my\\* deathbed. I thought this was incredibly ridiculous and dramatic and we did not need to hear this. And quite honestly I am tired of being the therapist all the time.\n\nMy sister was really disturbed and uncomfortable and afterwards told me she does not want to hear anything from our mom about dad anymore.\n\nSo the other day I mentioned to my mom how we were uncomfortable about her comments during the bday dinner and it isn't something we needed to hear. My mom got mad at me and said \"it is just like you, always sticking up for him.\" WTF? I am trying to be rational with her. Plus I do not think it is appropriate talking about this over and over how devastated you are about your divorce with your children, it doesn't matter if we are adults. AITA for feeling this way?

I'd tell her that any time she starts down this topic and hang up the phone/leave the room immediately. Make it clear to her that she requires professional help and your personal boundary is not listening to her drag you into a 15 year old divorce.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She's putting you and sister in the middle. She's also trying to turn you into flying monkies. Tell her if she's really that upset and still clinging to all this she needs therapy. Professional help. Trauma dumping on her kids doesn't equate to therapy. She needs prof help.", "NTA. She's trauma dumping on you and your sister instead of getting the help she needs from a professional. I also feel like this is a covert way to get you and your sister to align with her *against* your dad and that's not okay, no matter what age you are! I'm sure you love your mom immensely, but this just isn't your burden to bear.", "NTA! \n\nWe're not our parents' therapists or best friends they can unload their personal stuff on. Some is fine but there have to be boundaries.\nWith my mother, it took me threatening to not talk to her anymore at all for her to understand that she couldn't unload her issues on me. When she cried and said she had no one else to talk to, I told her that I'm sorry but it's still not my job.\nThat was about 3 to 4 years ago and nowadays our relationship is better than it ever was and I don't get annoyed anymore whenever I see her name on my phone.\nSo my advice to you is: set clear boundaries, stick to them, and go through with the rules you set (no contact until she learns etc). Best of luck!!", "Absolutely NTA. Research gray rocking. If she won\u2019t listen to you and your sister asking her not to put you in the middle and talk about her divorce, then just gray rock her constantly. Change the subject and walk away/hung up. If you want, have one last attempt at telling her/last conversation about it and tell her that you and sister both don\u2019t want to hear about it, you\u2019re not her flying monkeys, you\u2019re not choosing sides and you both recommend she seeks professional help\u2026then never speak of it with her again. If she chooses to ignore your wishes, she\u2019s only hurting her relationship with you & your sister. She\u2019s crossing boundaries and boundaries need consequences.", "NTA\n\nShe should have gotten a real therapist years ago. She wants you to pick sides, and that's not a healthy way to be with her children. And is she with her boyfriend because she's afraid to be alone? Why be with him if she isn't over the divorce? He must be very submissive if he has put up with her so long.", "NTA. But this is not your problem, and it should not be. If she won't stop talking about the past, all you can do is minimize her opportunities to do so. She knows how you feel now, so in the future, maybe your sister and you can collaborate to stand up as soon as she starts in, and make motions as though you're ready to leave the room or the house. If she realizes you're doing that and asks you to stay, you will need to either stay and be ready with some very different topics of conversation, or make good on the threat and leave altogether. Maybe she will figure it out eventually when you both keep getting up and leaving.", "NTA at all\n\nDon\u2019t complain to your kids about the divorce is like rule #1. I saw your comment that she doesn\u2019t believe in therapy but even one hour coparenting seminars cover this as rule #1. It\u2019s not fair to the kids.", "NTA, set those boundaries.  If need be leave her presence should she continue along these lines.  You and your sister don't need to constantly be pulled into this.  Her issues are with your father and their former marriage, not with you and your sister.  If she hasn't seen a therapist by now she isn't likely too.  The best you can do is shut these conversations down even if that means walking away.  Hopefully she will get the message.", "NTA\n\nI would wager OP is glossing over a lot of issues in the statement, \"dad didn't want to be married anymore\". Almost all of the divorce advice I've seen revolves around not putting your kids in the middle of it. You should only answer questions about the divorce if the kids ask when they are old enough to understand. \n\nI think OP needs some curt statements to stop these gatherings from becoming pity parties.\n\n\"Still bitter huh?\"\n\n\"That's enough this is a happy occasion.\"", "NTA, the moms reaction to being told she made her kids uncomfortable was just not good. The original comment was inappropriate. I personally(which doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right) would give her a break. It sounds like she\u2019s been suffering and unhappy, and drinking will bring that out. The whole situation , to me, seems a tad blown out of proportion", "NTA. Your children are not your therapists and she shouldn\u2019t be badmouthing your dad around you guys.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure divorce sucks especially when children are involved but it really isn\u2019t appropriate for her to lay that heavy shit on you. That\u2019s what therapists are there for. Kids go through their own grieving process when their parents split, they shouldn\u2019t have to endure additional trauma. Also, I feel bad for her current boyfriend.", "NTA. I wish your mom could get over him. And not be a dick to her current bf. Poor guy, hasn't he figured out he's not the one?", "ESH. You might have wanted to come at that at a different angle. Also your adults now she's gonna tell you things like that. But I will agree she's taking it to far. So it's not surprising her children are not happy with it. \n\nIt's sad that she feels that way after 15 years, shes morning for the life she had. The family together and the idea of loving eachother and living together until they go old and gray and eventually die. So when he left her no only did he take that dream with him. It was then put back in her face when you and your sister did trips with them both. I think You all need to reflect on your selfs, and try and empathise with eachother. \n\nShe needs to see that in her lashing out saying these things it's hurting you and sister. But she needs to someone she can trust to talk to.", "ESH", "ESH- can you have less empathy for your mother? Any less? \n\nSo she was with your father, raised you kids , and once she was what 40 he ditched her. The kids are grown right?\n\nShe had built and planned for two decades around that man. But he changed his mind. He got to have his children raised, and then dumped her. And he's the good guy in this story? \n\nYou think they get along fine because your mother has had class enough not to tell you outright how shitty it has been being used and dumped. \n\nNow she's opened up about it and your reaction is to be rude.\n\nYou are a 30 year old adult. It's time to look at your mother as a woman. a human. Not just your mother. \n\nYou might not want to hear negativity about your dad. But it's really immature to act like your mother is wrong for still feeling betrayed and being upset that her kids still defend the man who betrayed her. \n\nIt's not about you. It's about her. Wrong place wrong time . Yeah . \n\nBut get over the fact that maybe your dad is the arse here. Give your mother some credit.

Your mom needs to realize that your relationship with your father is entirely separate from her relationship with him as her ex-husband. It\u2019s unfair and unfortunate that she\u2019s trying to pull you into the middle of her complicated feelings about the split with him. As others have stated, she needs therapy. Perhaps it would be a good idea for you and your sister to attend a session with her.\n\nAnd no, it\u2019s not \u201cstanding up for him\u201d to ask not to be placed in the middle of whatever dynamic exists between the 2 of them.", "NTA she needs therapy and her bf needs to run.", "Unfortunately she thinks therapy is a sham. I feel like I might have to limit interactions with her for now.", "I agree. Because when I say anything that is perceived by her as taking sides then she twists it and complains we are always sticking up and feeling sorry for him.", "Esh- agreed. He didn't just end the marriage as soon as you were adults. He ended her planned future for the last 2 decades of her life. She was lied to. And cheated out of the life she invested in.   It's a part of her life. A major one. You can't just tell someone they can't talk about it. You are an adult. Have some empathy for the woman.", "And that someone she can trust are not her children. How is OP the AH? Because she doesn't wanna talk about the divorce of their parents that happened 10 years ago? After listening to her mother complaining FOR YEARS. There's no other angle, if they don't want to hear about it that's it. NTA", "Damn, you're assuming so much about this guy, with no basis for any of it whatsoever.\n\nAll we know is he broke up with her. That is not enough info to conclude that he used or betrayed her.\n\nMaybe he just fell out of love with OPs mom? And given how OP described how she acts with her BF, and what she wants OP to do, if any of that is indicative of how she acted before the divorce, I can't really blame him.", "And that's ok! Your mom needs to learn to respect boundaries. Draw this one clearly, make it clear what the consequences are for disrespecting it, and hopefully she will learn.", "thats fine, you cant force people into therapy after all anyways.\n\njust explain to her that if she talks about her divorce again, you ll go low or no contact with her until she has sorted her issues out or start leaving the room like imothro suggested.\n\ni am in a similar boat as you and it has really bothered me in the past and had a profound impact on my child/adulthood. shes been doing this ever since i was about 11 or 12, my parents divorced when i was 8 and im in my 30s now. its not as bad as it used to be but she has her moments and its uncomfortable because she holds so many grudges and just cant let go.\n\nyou need boundaries and stick to them and if she crosses them then there will have to be consequences. even though you are an adult, you re not her therapist.", "Then you very frankly tell her that you refuse to discuss this further as it's toxic, manipulative behavior. She's not behaving like a parent; in fact, she's not even behaving like an adult! This is some high school drama behavior, and nobody wants or needs that.", "I really don't think we know anywhere near enough details of this relationship and how they split up to say that he lied to her or cheated her out of the life she invested in.", "I didn't think OP was. I think the idea that mum won't discuss adult topics with her 2 grown up children is the only thing OP was incorrect about. The rest of it is empathy for the mother. She's planned a life that though no fault of her own was ripped from her. \n\nAlso I haven't said who the person she trusts should be. You have assumed I ment the children, I gave no answer to who because I don't know what situation she's in. If she lonely outside of the kids and BF. If not maybe she could try opening up to a friend, if she has the money a therapist would be best, if she's willing to go. There are alot of options here that can be done.\n\nNo where have I said mum should go round bitching about dad. I do think she can say she still misses him. Which is different from you better tell him on my death bed that he made me miserable. There are different ways to express the same thing mum went OTT which my comment states  \n\nBut your mistaking being in ear shot and listening, because if they were this would have been seen for what it was years ago.", "Here are facts. \n\nAfter the children were grown, he ended the marriage . \n\nIn marriage you say vows , for better or worse until death due us part. \n\nIf she believed and trusted in those vows/ promises, she would have every right to feel used and discarded . \n\nCurrent behavior states, she waited 15 years to say anything. And she was drunk when she said it. \n\nShe doesn't want her boyfriend to move in. So what. After being betrayed after 20 years, no I would never support or rely on anyone else. \n\nHave perspective outside of a child's.", "I know a twenty year marriage ending in ,daddy just doesn't want to be married, that 15 years later she still wants her life back.  \n\nWhen you say vows they are a forever promise. Ending that promise is a lie. \n\nSpending 20 years supporting a person in life just to have them walk away , is getting cheated out of the emotional and time investment . \n\nA forty plus year old woman in society is all but invisible. A woman who dedicated her life to a marriage doesn't have the same support as a single woman would. Men too. \n\nSo yeah I'm going to stand by and defend my thoughts on it.", "You voted ES H, now you say OP is not the AH. She's not incorrect, because she, as a grown up children, also known as adult, can decide whether he wants to discuss their parents divorce or not. Also, this was a birthday dinner, so it wasn't appropiate to dump her misery or regrets to their children. \n\nShe can say whatever she wants, they can decide they are uncomfortable and tell her to stop talking about their dad.  \n\nMaybe you wanted to say N A H and was a mistake. E S H means Everyone Sucks here.", "So what, he fell out of love with her, and that means he should just be stuck in a loveless marriage for the rest of his life?\n\nNah, fuck that. Sometimes people fall out of love with each other. It sucks, but it doesn't make either person an asshole, nor does it mean either person is a bad person.", "Yes everyone does suck here doesn't mean I think OP is AH. The world's not black and white, and sometimes there's a gray area.\n\nAt the end of the day none of them have empathy for each other. It's a sad story all round. And they need to work on them selfs and how they treat eachother.", "And yet she still retains the right to feel betrayed and want what was once promised to her that she worked towards. \n\nIt's still valid .", "She can feel betrayed all she wants, that doesn't mean it's true or valid.", "If someone makes you a promise, a vow before God and country,signs a legal binding contract, and then breaks that promise. It is absolutely valid to feel betrayed. \n\nAny other logic doesn't make sense. Any way you try to spin it."]}
