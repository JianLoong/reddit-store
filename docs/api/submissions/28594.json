She just stole your lasagna", "NTA in any respect. WTAF is with the sister? Denying her kids food? Didn't everyone just eat? AND, ain't them her kids? She's responsible for them not you. The sister is a piece of work. She is TA in this story. Your BF just lost his job. The food should be left for you two. Jeebus! People are so selfish and entitled anymore. She's rude and inconsiderate. I would've opened the door up for her and slammed it behind her. You did absolutely nothing wrong. I hope your BF doesn't blame you for his sister's actions either.", "NTA \n\nI seriously don't understand what you could have done wrong here. You didn't even demand that she shouldn't take any lasagna, she was just asked *how much* she would be taking. She has no reason to blow up.", "NTA bc as their mother it is her responsibility to provide her children dinner, not yours. The fact that she blatantly stole your lasagna and then screamed about \"denying\" her children left over food that you prepared in the first place is just mind-blowing.", "NTA\n\nHonestly if I was visiting family and they got fired two days into the trip, I would leave unless I am physically unable to do so. \n\nCan't believe they stayed and thought the leftovers are just theirs for no good reason. Super weird", "NTA. She overstepped by packing up the food and then getting confrontational with your boyfriend.\n\nYour boyfriend fought with her, she got upset at being called out, and you started crying and ran to your room. Why are you crying and carrying on? Your poor boyfriend definitely caught between a rock and a hard place. Just apologize to your boyfriend.", "NTA at all, like not even close", "NTA. Your bf's sister should have at least asked.", "You are definitely NTA. I would say Sister is by virtue of her resorting to screaming. Its natural for BF to have a bit of anxiety about money having JUST lost his job.", "NTA. She stealing your food. As a guest in your home this is YOUR food, and if you don\u2019t want to give her the leftovers she can figure it out for herself she sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA- is she the golden child or what? Because she sounds so horribly entitled. It\u2019s a very fair question to ask. It\u2019s your home, your rules. Same for your boyfriend to ask legitimately to his sister.", "NTA Is this real? She feels entitled to leech off you.", "Well you clearly didn\u2019t make her feel unwelcome.. she stole your lasagna lol\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Was she raised under a slug under a rock?", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't do anything. Your bf took it up on himself to ask how much she was taking. She didn't need to get so defensive.", "NTA. It\u2019s the sister\u2019s turn to make and donate the lasagne next time.", "NTA so knowing her brother got laid off she decided to section off food for herself and kids and FU to everyone else. She wouldn\u2019t be welcome in my home. She knew better but as they say the best defense is a good offense. Instead of saying oh my gosh I wasn\u2019t thinking no she attacked. Don\u2019t worry about it", "NTA.\n\nWhen I stay with someone, I generally make a dinner as thank you. Or take the hosts out.", "NTA. You did not make them feel unwelcome. Your bf gently flagged their selfish / entitled behaviour, and they kicked off. NTA. I would not invite them to stay again unless they have learned better manners", "NTA. Maybe there is missing information, but I cannot see where you did anything wrong in this situation.\n\nI hope you and BF don't invite these people back into your home anytime soon.", "NTA. She tried to make you feel bad about *her* rudeness and theft!", "NTA. Its YOUR house and THEY'RE the guests. Not the other way around but the sister sure is acting like it. She's obviously taking advantage and then trying to guilt trip you when she doesn't get her way. I pray for her kids futures if that's how she behaves.", "Sorry, I don\u2019t think I clarified well enough: \n\nHer kids were eating and they didn\u2019t finish, so she packed what they didn\u2019t finish and added some more on top and that\u2019s when my bf asked her how much she\u2019s planning on taking.", "Thanks for your comment!\n\nHis sister feels like I was rude in telling my bf that if there wasn\u2019t enough left for us, that it was fine. She felt like that comment was rude, and it made me feel like I started the whole thing and did something wrong. I feel like, had I not said anything, none of this would\u2019ve happened.", "Oh, gotcha.\n\nStill counts though I think. She should only have taken what they were served and haven\u2019t finished. Nothing extra.", "As soon as she started adding to the plate she was rude for taking leftovers that were not offered to her.", "She feels it was rude to point out that she was taking more than her due. That\u2019s terribly convenient *for her.*"]}
