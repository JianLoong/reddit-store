She just stole your lasagna", "NTA in any respect. WTAF is with the sister? Denying her kids food? Didn't everyone just eat? AND, ain't them her kids? She's responsible for them not you. The sister is a piece of work. She is TA in this story. Your BF just lost his job. The food should be left for you two. Jeebus! People are so selfish and entitled anymore. She's rude and inconsiderate. I would've opened the door up for her and slammed it behind her. You did absolutely nothing wrong. I hope your BF doesn't blame you for his sister's actions either.", "NTA \n\nI seriously don't understand what you could have done wrong here. You didn't even demand that she shouldn't take any lasagna, she was just asked *how much* she would be taking. She has no reason to blow up.", "NTA bc as their mother it is her responsibility to provide her children dinner, not yours. The fact that she blatantly stole your lasagna and then screamed about \"denying\" her children left over food that you prepared in the first place is just mind-blowing.", "NTA\n\nHonestly if I was visiting family and they got fired two days into the trip, I would leave unless I am physically unable to do so. \n\nCan't believe they stayed and thought the leftovers are just theirs for no good reason. Super weird", "NTA. She overstepped by packing up the food and then getting confrontational with your boyfriend.\n\nYour boyfriend fought with her, she got upset at being called out, and you started crying and ran to your room. Why are you crying and carrying on? Your poor boyfriend definitely caught between a rock and a hard place. Just apologize to your boyfriend.", "NTA at all, like not even close", "NTA. Your bf's sister should have at least asked.", "You are definitely NTA. I would say Sister is by virtue of her resorting to screaming. Its natural for BF to have a bit of anxiety about money having JUST lost his job.", "NTA. She stealing your food. As a guest in your home this is YOUR food, and if you don\u2019t want to give her the leftovers she can figure it out for herself she sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA- is she the golden child or what? Because she sounds so horribly entitled. It\u2019s a very fair question to ask. It\u2019s your home, your rules. Same for your boyfriend to ask legitimately to his sister.", "NTA Is this real? She feels entitled to leech off you.", "Well you clearly didn\u2019t make her feel unwelcome.. she stole your lasagna lol\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Was she raised under a slug under a rock?", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't do anything. Your bf took it up on himself to ask how much she was taking. She didn't need to get so defensive.", "NTA. It\u2019s the sister\u2019s turn to make and donate the lasagne next time.", "NTA so knowing her brother got laid off she decided to section off food for herself and kids and FU to everyone else. She wouldn\u2019t be welcome in my home. She knew better but as they say the best defense is a good offense. Instead of saying oh my gosh I wasn\u2019t thinking no she attacked. Don\u2019t worry about it", "NTA.\n\nWhen I stay with someone, I generally make a dinner as thank you. Or take the hosts out.", "NTA. You did not make them feel unwelcome. Your bf gently flagged their selfish / entitled behaviour, and they kicked off. NTA. I would not invite them to stay again unless they have learned better manners", "NTA. Maybe there is missing information, but I cannot see where you did anything wrong in this situation.\n\nI hope you and BF don't invite these people back into your home anytime soon.", "NTA. She tried to make you feel bad about *her* rudeness and theft!", "NTA. Its YOUR house and THEY'RE the guests. Not the other way around but the sister sure is acting like it. She's obviously taking advantage and then trying to guilt trip you when she doesn't get her way. I pray for her kids futures if that's how she behaves.", "Sorry, I don\u2019t think I clarified well enough: \n\nHer kids were eating and they didn\u2019t finish, so she packed what they didn\u2019t finish and added some more on top and that\u2019s when my bf asked her how much she\u2019s planning on taking.", "Thanks for your comment!\n\nHis sister feels like I was rude in telling my bf that if there wasn\u2019t enough left for us, that it was fine. She felt like that comment was rude, and it made me feel like I started the whole thing and did something wrong. I feel like, had I not said anything, none of this would\u2019ve happened.", "Oh, gotcha.\n\nStill counts though I think. She should only have taken what they were served and haven\u2019t finished. Nothing extra.", "As soon as she started adding to the plate she was rude for taking leftovers that were not offered to her.", "She feels it was rude to point out that she was taking more than her due. That\u2019s terribly convenient *for her.*", "INFO: If she's staying with you, where was she packing it up to take?

Why? If they\u02bbre staying with you why wouldn\u02bbt they be eating lasagna for dinner? Why weren\u02bbt the kids there for lunch?", "NTA I would not invite them (or at least the sister) into my home again. Instead meet up at neutral locations.", "This is hilarious.", "NTA.  But if he isn't working, why isn't he dealing with his whacko family's messes?", "NTA - I saw in another comment that they were going to be out of the house for dinner. You have no responsibility to feed HER kids when they're not in your home. She's the AH for presuming to tale more than her due when she already knows you guys are in a tough spot. To then get confrontational about it in your home? That's unacceptable.", "NTA\n\nLasagna thief. \n\nThere was a post here years ago about a guy whose girlfriend had made lasagna for them. She was on a strict budget and she had planned to eat the lasagna for the week. He eats, then asks if he can take leftovers for his parents.\n\n The next day the gf asks him where the lasagna was, he had taken it all, does he say sorry and bring it back? \n\nNope, he and his family ate for days. \n\nHe was actually annoyed that she asked him to buy her lunch because he had no food left.\n\nOne of my fav asshole.", "NTA.", "NTA. What the actual fuck kind of people think they are entitled to take left overs without even asking. I would never assume I could take food to go for someone who wasn't at the meal.\n\nMake them more unwelcome, and maybe they won't darken your doorstep again.", "You weak people creep me out.", "NTA.\n\nTry T-Posing next time.\n\nBest of luck to the bf, I hope he finds something soon!", "NTA.  This is his family and take a cue from him.  He was mad she was taking food without asking.  She was being rude.  Then she yelled in your home while stealing your food.  She didn\u2019t feel you were denying her child food.  She was using her child as an excuse to steal your food.  That is not okay.  You need to find your voice and realize neither of you deserve to be treated that way in your home.  It is completely acceptable for your response to behavior like that in your home to be, \u201cget out now.\u201d", "NTA OP.  Taking more on top of what they didn\u2019t finish?  That\u2019s just poor manners.", "Were they still staying with you and we\u2019re going to be eating the leftovers at your house anyway that night, or were they leaving to go home after lunch?\n\nEither way NTA, just didn\u2019t get why they were taking leftovers when they are staying with you for a week", "NTA i guess. but the whole situation does not revolve around you, you are a mere bystander if that makes sense, and also collateral dmg. as such you dont have to worry about a thing this is between the siblings", "Thanks for your comment!! She wanted to pack a quick and fast dinner for her kids because they were going to be out of the house for their dinner time. \n\nAlso, 100%. With chicken and bechamel sauce\ud83e\udd0c", "> *I would not invite them to stay again*\n\n.....especially for a holiday dinner.  She'd probably bring tupperware, expecting a great haul.\n\nNTA", "Great questions! They have consoled him a bit, and told him that everything will be fine and that he will find another job. \n\nThey haven\u2019t offered to help out with expenses. We\u2019ve been treating them to most things, which I have no problem with because that\u2019s how I usually treat my guests. \n\nMy thing is; the way she acted was so out of hand, and especially in front of her children. The entitlement she had was obscene and the fact that they packed their things and went to a rental is just insane to me. I love my boyfriend, but his family has absolutely no manners.", "Thanks for your comment!! So they were going to spend the rest of the day at the park, and then go to a friends house and she wanted to have dinner ready for her kids.  The kids were there eating lunch, but they didn\u2019t finish. That\u2019s when she packed their leftovers and began adding more, and my bf asked her how much she was planning on taking", "Sorry - she screamed at you in your own house? I would tell her that yes, people who don't respect their hosts, abuse their hospitality by freeloading and hoarding the hosts' food, and are doing so when they KNOW that finances and nerves are strained, are indeed not welcome. What would be welcome is an apology, a financial contribution to the food consumed, and respectful behaviour.", "Sounds like one visit is enough. Don't invite them to stay again"]}
