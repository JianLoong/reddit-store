By magic?", "Why didn't she text them", "NTA\n\nI imagine she *felt* insensitive and inattentive and wrongly took that out on you. I'm sure she feels horrible about hearing LO fuss and not being able to tend to that herself. I suppose she would have appreciated your text sounding less like her doling out orders and more like, \"Hey if LO won't settle, he might be hungry, kiddo is growing like a weed!\" If that's the case, she needs to convey that to you, though.\n\nMight be worth it to check in with her and see if she's content with how she feels the grandparents are handling things. I wouldn't apologize for this instance since I don't feel you did anything out of line, but wouldn't hurt to acknowledge that she feels some kind of way about it and get to the bottom of why. Once you know that you two can brainstorm a way to move forward.", "NTA - I could see your wife being upset that you passed along \"my wife\" and made her seem critical of your parents as caretakers. There might've been a more delicate way to suggest giving the child more food without mentioning your wife, like just saying you weren't sure the baby got enough to eat earlier. \n\nBut it's not something you actually did wrong, and it sounds like you only mentioned her because you weren't home so of course you personally wouldn't have heard the baby being fussy.", "NTA. She's taking her frustration out on you.", "NTA\u2026 you didn\u2019t throw her under the bus at all and she is just being sensitive because she didn\u2019t come check on the baby herself. She needs to get a grip.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife knows that your parents have raised children before, right?\n\nAnd how would that make her look insensitive and inattentive? I thought it made her look more micro-managey.", "Really? \n\nAnd just how were you supposed to know your baby was fussing, unless she told you? Clairvoyance?\n\nNTA. Your wife is being ridiculously irrational.", "NTA unlucky", "Women are programmed to hone in on baby cries and sounds. It was probably killing her that she couldn\u2019t go and give her attention to your baby. It probably made her feel guilty too. This has nothing to do with you and just her frustration over being committed to something else. NTA, wouldn\u2019t take it personally.", "NTA. She made a bad call and she\u2019s putting her frustration on you.", "Martial advice here ( I have 4 kids been married to the same woman for over a decade) you ATAH, always.  Not really but if you want to have a happy marriage you will accept the blame, just use the phrase, \"Yes dear, you are right, I am an idiot.\" If you want to be \"right\" marriage and kids were not the correct choice for you.\n\nSeriously, your wife's hormones and baby protecting urges are in overdrive (hearing their own baby cry makes Mom want to kill anything and everyone who is in the way, literally even you) she CANNOT do what her body is telling her to do so you must do everything she asks you to do and even the things she doesn't know to ask you for. \n\nYou know you're doing it right if it feels harder than anything you have ever done and it won't end until death or divorce.  \n\ud83e\udd72I have only one tear for you my friend, get over it! Lol\nBut seriously good luck with your new family!", "NTA", "There is a LOT of guilt around being a working mother, even in this day and age. It doesn't seem like you or your parents are causing the problem, but it might help to ask your wife if she's getting flak from anyone about your arrangement for child care.\n\nSome are brought up with a mid-20th century mindset (sometimes in an abusive way) about being a mother, and when they do what is typical in the 21st century workplace and run into something that triggers them, they have a reaction that doesn't seem to fit the situation. \n\nTake a breath and talk with her. She may be experiencing a bit of anxiety/depression.  Help her talk through it.", "NTA but your mom might be. You say she asked why your wife didn\u2019t just come down herself; I\u2019m kind of wondering if she then gave your wife a hard time and your wife interpreted that as meaning you had blamed her in some way. Older folks sometimes have unfortunate biases about how women should drop their work for baby needs, and it seems odd that your mom didn\u2019t already know/understand that your wife was busy in meetings - wasn\u2019t that the whole reason you needed your mom there?", "As a husband you are just suppose to know what your wife wants/means. The Y chromosome allows men to be mind readers and sense when a baby is fussy.", "NTA \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut I completely get why your wife is annoyed, she wanted you to mention things without mentioning her, because it does make her look bad to your parents, but she was probably not wanting to go down and say anything because she didn't want to come across as not trusting them to take care of your kid. And you in your honesty said exactly what she told you to, which is fair... Lol. But fyi... In future... She doesn't want you to mention her when bringing up an issue. That's just my female point of view. I would have had the exact same thought and reaction as your wife ;) lol.", "LMAO! And this, good friends, demonstrates one of the differences between men and women. A man just spouts facts, while his wife wanted him to sugar-coat it or reword it so it didn\u2019t sound like\u2026 exactly what it was. Made her look a little bad, but a bit of embarrassment never killed anyone, especially when it\u2019s justified.", "NTA.  Miscommunication.  She told you in short hand because she was busy and expected you to translate to be more affectionate and personable.  You dropped the ball but the drop is not asshole worthy.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s 2023. If she was that invested in the baby crying, she could say one second folks, I hear something downstairs and ppl will understand, especially if it\u2019s a one off. I\u2019m on calls all day, and once a week someones like brb. You\u2019re not performing surgery. \n\nSo her saying she came off insensitive (ya!) and inattentive (ya!). Why, because she inserted herself into something through proxy when she could have just come down to assist. If she was unable to come down, then stay out of it, the infant is with two what I assume to be functioning adults.", "INFO\n\n> We have a 7 month old baby that is watched by a nanny most days but on some days, my parent's come over during the day to help out.\n\nYour parent's *what* come over?

You are the bosses in partnership.  \n\nHow do you feel when your boss tells you of a new policy and says \"my manager asked for this?\"  It implicitly undercuts the manager, because it implies you don't endorse the decision. \n\nWhen your wife asks for something, and you are willing to accommodate it, you present yourselves as a united front.  \n\n\"Mom, Dad, we noticed the baby's fussing a bit, and we've found that sometimes a little extra food will help with that.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
