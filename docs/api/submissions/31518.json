I (as a woman) have worked hard on always trying to see both sides and trying to always verbalize what it is I'm thinking and feeling. So I completely get where OP was coming from, I also agree that a lot of the time most women expect their partner to know what they want or meant. And that's not fair on the partner. My thought process behind the talk it out, is in the hope that ops wife is mature enough to look back on the event and realise how what happened was unavoidable in the way she communicated with op. A lot of the time people are so quick to assume that everyone else is at fault or females are just male bashing, when in actuality I'm not. I already posted that OP is NTA. And I stand by that. Now, do I think the situation is fair on op...? No! But I'm also not going to call his wife the AH because she's not either. Her request and reaction was not malicious, it was not done to hurt either op or his parents. It was clearly done because she didn't want to come across as the bad guy, and felt like raising a concern about their child would come across better from OP. Now, was the execution of this well done- absolutely not! Lol. Ops wife made a request without clarifying and stipulating how she wanted op to proceed, that's on her. She assumed op would understand what she wanted and execute it the way she wanted him to and he didn't. -still on her. Ops only mistake was not clarifying how exactly she expected him to call his parents about a solution to a problem he was not in residence to witness. OP's calling his parents as requested is a mark in his favour, he trusted his wife. There was no way for him to know how exactly his wife wanted it handled. But I personally don't think there would be any point in making this bigger than simple miscommunication. I do believe ops wife should apologize for her lack of verbalizing her wishes and her reaction to op doing what she asked. And that is why I had recommended talking it out. There is no other way to resolve an issue like this unless both parties understand how the issue occurred and work together in the future to prevent it from occurring again. If ops wife doesn't recognise her participation in the issue- then that would be a different story, and a bigger problem. Right now, I hope they can honestly and openly talk It out and both learn to communicate better.

But what family do you see that is struggling to provide food and pay rent that has a nanny? Wealthy families have nannies. families that struggle with these things send the kids to grandma, work during school hours, work nights so one parent is always home, etc. Families struggling to put food on the table don't have nannies.", "Weird take", "Ah yes, I\u2019ll take the night shift teaching at the public high school /s", "This just sounds like one of those \"we were miserable so everyone else should be too\" parents.", "Also yelled at the sky and tied an onion to his belt because that was the style at the time...", "Precisely. At that point, they're not mere in-laws, but they're babysitters for HER kid", "I\u2019m glad you and your fianc\u00e9 were able to work that out!", "I also think he is not the AH. However, I suspect she assumed he\u2019d pad it a little more. Example: \u201chey mom, I was just talking with Wife and she mentioned/I could hear in the background that Baby was crying. Wife was worried she forgot to tell you that we\u2019ve been giving Baby his bottle at Z o\u2019clock, so she just asked me to check in. She wishes she could come herself, but she was just going into a meeting she can\u2019t get out of.\u201d \n\nThat conveys the same information as \u201cWife told me Baby is crying. She says you should feed him. She can\u2019t come down right now because she\u2019s busy with work.\u201d But the first version is a lot softer and less likely to come across as if he\u2019s relaying a peremptory command from an annoyed Wife. \n\nAgain, I DON\u2019T think OP is an AH if he missed that nuance. I\u2019m just saying there\u2019s a middle ground between \u201cWife hears Baby crying, feed him now!\u201d and \u201cI psychically know baby is crying and you should feed him; my wife has zero involvement with this.\u201d This kind of nuance is especially important if, for instance, there has already been friction between the wife and mother.", "Thank you for your feedback.", "Or... they could all be adults and use their words, and not sink into existential angst over the possible subtext their words might engender.\n\nAs you said, this is an assumption. \n\nCurious how hard some are reaching in an effort to make the OP the bad guy.", "Yep.. my mom's response to my wife is always \"I've raised plenty of kids\"\n\nAnd I tell her. Things have changed since then. A lot of what you did would land you in jail today.", "I did not. Your spouse has a problem, which is common in your family and instead of figuring out why it exists you're like _hur dur women_. I feel sorry for your wife", "The fallout doesn\u2019t automatically mean they aren\u2019t on great terms. Appearances matter, and not wanting to bring things up for fear of a negatively look is a common thing. My fianc\u00e9 has this issue and sometimes still worries coming off a certain way to my family. \n\nAnd no, they\u2019re a team, but they\u2019re still two individuals. He shouldn\u2019t have to lie to his parents to save face for her. Especially in this situation where\u2019s there\u2019s pretty nothing he could\u2019ve done to not seem suspicious.\n\nI agree they need to talk. But just as much as you claim he needs to be understanding, so does she.", "Of course. This is why I said NTA. Still, to make a marriage work it\u2019s sometimes useful to try to do a moderate amount of investigating because even decent people aren\u2019t always perfect communicators.", "And how do said families become wealthy? By being SAHPs, or by being out working? Yes, it\u2019s possible for one parent to bring in enough that the other parent could stay home, but this can come at huge costs to the SAHP, who then has to quit a job and find their way back into the workforce with a gap in their resum\u00e9.", "How so?", "Yep, sounds like it.", "Spot on, him and wifey blew up their marriage so everyone else needs to sacrifice theirs insteas of utilizing childcare.", "We weren't it was hard but we did it.", "Way back in nineteen dicketty two. They had to call it \u2018dicketty\u2019 cause the Kaiser had stolen their word for \u2018twenty\u2019", "Yikes, this is way off. You\u2019re not obtuse, and your tried to help as you were asked. All wife has to do was say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m stuck in a meeting. If the baby is extra fussy, can you please give him a little extra in the bottle? That would help so much. Thanks for all of your help. It\u2019s greatly appreciated!\u201d\nThis is not the time to get into historical in-law trauma. Save those conversations for when the parents are off the clock. If she\u2019s not comfortable engaging with your parents, then you should look into alternative childcare.\nAbsolutely NTA", "OP is not the bad guy, only somewhat misguided. I don't know if it's a cultural thing (OP seems to be from a similar culture to me) but I would expect my partner deals with their parents when certain expectations are at play, and vice versa. \n\nOP has known his mom all his life while wife is a relative stranger. No one gets immediate intimate family status and hence, it takes time to get to the level of informality that would be required when questioning the ILs parenting skills. OP can do it, maybe wife cannot yet, not without side eyes or a sharp remark. Maybe wife is completely delusional, but not in my experience. \n\nWhich is why a conversation is needed", "Huge assumption there. We've talked and talked about it. Sometimes husbands are the emotional backbones but you're like hurr dur men.", "Sure. But she\u2019s not the one here asking for advice from Reddit.", "I never suggested being a SAHP? I don't understand what you are saying. I grew up with both parents working at different hours when possible or sending me to grandma when not to keep food on the table. No one in my city who went to the public school that I did had a nanny. No one who is struggling like that has a nanny.", "I\u2019m h shit my bad. I\u2019m drunk. I responded to the wrong comment", "Good for you. Doesn't mean it's for everyone. Kind of insane that something worked well for you so you decide to violently shove it down everyone's throat.", "Nah man. I'm like hur dur you. Plenty of men who know how to respect their partners out there. You don't seem to be one of them"]}
