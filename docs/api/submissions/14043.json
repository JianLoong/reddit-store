If a parent is comfortable in a particular environment, that parent might feel it's OK to bring a baby in a carrier into that environment.  What would be more dangerous is to bring a toddler into the kitchen.  But what is a baby in a carrier going to do?

I was napping under the salad bar when my baby sister was born. \n\nFor smaller, mom and pop type places, this is very common.
