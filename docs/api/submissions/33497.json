But before that, I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to the original post; your insights were incredibly valuable in helping me navigate this situation.\n\nAs expected, I did end up spending a few nights sleeping on the couch. My wife was very angry with me, so I kept my distance and allowed her time to cool off. During this time, I've been keeping the replacement ring with me, as I didn't think my wife would even want to see it. Our youngest asked me why I was sleeping on the couch the other night, and I told him that it was good for his old man's back. It's another lie, but I didn't feel too bad going ahead with it.\n\nTuesday night, after the kids went to bed, I apologized profusely for the entire situation. I told her that there was zero justification for what I did and that I should have listened to her rather than tried to replace the ring. I told her that what I did was unbelievably foolish and inconsiderate and I then offered to explain to her family and friends the situation if they were to ask about it.\n\nWe did end up talking for a long time, and she told me that it was very difficult to describe how she felt about my actions. On the one hand, she was very frustrated that I thought I could just replace the ring; yet, on the other hand, she was a bit amused that I\u2019d go to such lengths and said she appreciates that aspect.\n\nShe ended up reaccepting the ring, and I was allowed back into our bedroom. Things do seem to be slowly returning to normal, but if there\u2019s one thing I've learned about married life, it\u2019s that this conversation will probably be revisited a few more times in the future, and they will likely make my wife upset again. For that reason, I have decided to buy my wife a necklace, which I'll surprise her with in a few days. I\u2019m thinking that this will hopefully soften her anger if this conversation ever does come up again.", "created_utc": 1703164467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18nmrcx/update_aita_for_having_my_wifes_missing_ring/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Maybe ease off on the jewelry giving.\n\nDo something sexy.

However, as I\u2019m sure you read a few times in the last post, you were in the wrong. I understand your intent was to ease her pain, however, I would argue your commitment to a potentially life long lie was not worth it. \n\nI would absolutely NOT call you an asshole. I would call you a very loving partner that was extremely dedicated to helping their partner but mistakenly went about it in a misguided way. \n\nYou accepted what happened, you apologized, you continue to try and make it right. You\u2019re a good dude that made a mistake, don\u2019t let anyone call you an AH.", "#[Please Find Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ktygw/aita_for_having_my_wifes_missing_ring_replicated/)", "Hooray!

I hope the two of you can find that ring somehow.\n\nGood luck.", "Why do some people always run to the fix, buy the thing and do this and bam it\u2019s all better. I get it, this is going to come up again and it\u2019s gonna make you feel bad and yucky again so you\u2019re now trying to prevent feeling bad in the future. \n\nOh the things we do to escape feeling bad. Thing is there\u2019s nothing wrong with negative but the fastest way to get over it is to feel it \n\nMy dude stop trying to fix or prevent negative feelings or situations. Just feel them and then move on. You don\u2019t have to live there but f\u2014k you cant outright avoid it. \n\nDaddy why are you sleeping on the couch?\n\nWhelp kiddo daddy messed up so he\u2019s in a time out until he learns his lesson.\n\nWhere\u2019s the lie? Also yeah what you said to the kid isn\u2019t a big deal but you get the point I\u2019m actually trying to make? You keep running from negative feelings or uncomfortable shit and make things worse than just sitting and feeling them. \n\nNegative doesn\u2019t last forever as long as you experience feel it and then move on.", "Good for you.  Maybe take the stones from that ring and have a necklace or bracelet made. What you did was so thoughtful and foolish,  it maybe that ring repurposed will give your wife another piece of sentimental jewelry.  If she ever finds her ring again, she would have a matching piece.  \n\nYou\u2019re a good man and a caring husband.  She\u2019s annoyed for now, but she already sees the misguided,  it beautiful sentiment. \n\nHave a great holiday.", "So I would take the couch cushions of, then stand on the springs and see all the crap that comes out even despite how you've looked there with your hands... I wouldn't be surprised if that's where you actually find the real ring", "I can't believe you thought that was gonna work originally. This isn't a sitcom.", "I guess the lesson here is that material value doesn't make up for sentimental value.", "*swoons*", "Lol, the deep voice suggestion sent me straight into the giggle zone!\n\nBut seriously, OP, definitely think of non-jewelry ways to show you appreciate her, too. Glad you two are working through this, and good luck!", "This would be soooooooooo sexy!", "Yeah I don\u2019t think OP was an asshole, I think he was an idiot. Hopefully he\u2019s learned the error of his ways. Sounds like yes."]}
