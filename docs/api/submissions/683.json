It was a quiet ish night when we made it to the bar, we thought it\u2019d be more people out and about but when we arrived it was pretty quiet. I had a nice time but at about 2am (we\u2019ve gone out around 10pm) I stated I was going home because I was tired and wanted to chill having a smoke before going bed. \n\nI did say earlier in the day that last night we could potentially go out until late (or early in the morning) as today is bank holiday and some of our friends don\u2019t have work. But as I said, the atmosphere wasn\u2019t great for partying hard as there was barely some people out and I just didn\u2019t feel in the mood to stay out drinking.\n\nAnyway, as I said I was leaving my friend started to question me for it, why was I leaving? And pointing out I was the one in the group chat saying we were going to stay until late but then was the first one leaving. I reminded her she has said earlier she was going home soon too, so asked what was her issue giving that she was planning to leave pretty much straight after me. \n\nOther thing that bothered me was that when I said I was planning to leave soon, I asked if she wanted to leave at the same time and accompany me and my other friend to walk the dog to where my car was parked. She said she didn\u2019t as it was cold and rather to go straight home but when I said I was leaving she said she had agreed to come with us to walk the dog to the car but SPECIFICALLY remember she saying no about that. Truth is that after arguing for some time whilst my other friends were quiet (they kinda bullied me at the beginning when I said I was leaving but I\u2019m a jokingly way), I got agitated and defensive and said \u201cI am leaving now, you\u2019re not the boss of me and don\u2019t tell me what to do.I know its not a big deal for me to wait 10 minutes but you\u2019ve literally tried to pressure me into staying and for that reason, I am now leaving so you don\u2019t try pressuring me next time I say I want to leave\u201d. (As this is not the first time she makes comments about me leaving at the time I want).\n\nAfter I left I texted in the group chat that I was sorry if I got a bit defensive but explained that I feel overwhelmed when I\u2019m am forced to give explanations of why I want to leave. Everyone said they did want to make me feel overwhelmed and that I can leave whenever! But her response was \u2018it\u2019s okay, I knew you was going to leave anyway, I know you well\u2019. So yeah, everyone took a hint but the one who actually made an issue out of it keeps blaming me! \n\nAm I the asshole here for not wanting to stay 10 more minutes or is it my friend for literally not being able to put herself in other people\u2019s shoes?", "created_utc": 1667305805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj7ga9/aita_for_changing_my_mind_and_wanting_to_go_home/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend sounds insufferable and childish. I think the one thing you probably did wrong was hanging around and letting her pressure you. Next time just say your good byes and leave. \n\nAlso if she keeps putting you down and being passive aggressive towards you, it might be time to stand up for yourself and let her know that the way she treats you is not okay.", "NTA.\n\nWhat the heck is wrong with your friend group?
