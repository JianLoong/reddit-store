But, it would be nice to have unbiased opinions on the matter. So, here goes.\n\nThere are various tv shows that I (30M) love to catch up on in my free time. Because of that, I have just about every TV streaming service you could think of. I do share access to these services with my mom and sister. I have created profiles for them and there are no issues there. I also share these services with my best friend, (31M). We will call him Vee. \n\nVee refuses to create and/or use his own profile on the streaming platforms. Instead, he uses mine. This is likely because I am the first profile at the top of the list. The issue here is that he and I enjoy many of the same shows. Often, I may pause or stop an episode in the middle of it in order to study, work or go to sleep. \n\nWhen Vee watches the same show on my profile, I lose my place and the next time I log in to watch, I have to figure out which episode I left off on and at which point. If he completes the show or movie, it also removes it from my \"Continue Watching\" feature altogether, which leaves me to search for the show AND THEN figure out where I left off. \n\nThis has grown to be pretty frustrating when it happens regularly. Work can be pretty challenging at times and I do think this exacerbates the situation as I tend to use TV to decompress from work.\n\nI have went as far as to create profiles for him and ask him several times to use it. But, I still come back to the same situation. So, WIBTA if I just changed my password altogether, locking him out?\n\n**Why I may BTA:** Well I think I might BTA because this feels like his actions may be insignificant and my response may be inappropriate. It feels like it may be a childish thing to do.\n\nTL;DR My best friend won't use his own profile on streaming networks and it leaves me to figure out where I left off.", "created_utc": 1683575486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13c2ppj/wibta_for_changing_my_tv_streaming_passwords/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NOPE.", "NTA, seeing as how you've created them a profile and asked them politely to not mess up your continue watching cue. You've given them a solution, they didn't take it, THEY AREN'T PAYING FOR IT! So I say, lock them out, maybe then they will be able to just use their own profile! \n\nSide note, this really fucks with people, I used to bully my ex's cue and mess up his continue watching cue by either fast forwarding a couple episodes and leaving it half way through and episode or going back a couple. Mild inconveniences that lead to (from what I have heard) huge meltdowns. LOL", "He who pays the bills gets to control the passwords in this situation.
