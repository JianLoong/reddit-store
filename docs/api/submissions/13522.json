I\u2019m not super close to her or her fianc\u00e9, but I love weddings so I said yeah I\u2019ll go.\n\nNow, the relevant part here is that I have a very good career and make an excellent living. Plus I love giving gifts and splurging a bit. So, I spoke with Molly and her fianc\u00e9 and promised them a custom made gaming pc since they game together. They were very happy, and thanked me a lot . The price of the pc would come out to be a little over $1500, not counting the monitor I was willing to throw in.\n\nA two months ago, Molly told me that unfortunately I had to be uninvited to the wedding as part of a cost cutting measure. She apologized, but assured me it was only because of cost. I was upset, but let it go. Then I found out a week or so later from a mutual acquaintance that was still going that Molly told her she had to cut people because she needed the invites for some of the groom\u2019s family who decided to come. I was pissed, so I decided to not give Molly the PC I promised.\nMolly\u2019s wedding happened two weeks ago  and from what I can tell, it was a nice ceremony. Afterward she actually texted me asking if we can talk about when the pc would arrive. I asked if we could call, she said yes. I told her that since I didn\u2019t go to the wedding that I wasn\u2019t going to get her a gift. We had a long argument, where she said I was being petty and that I was holding it against her that I couldn\u2019t come and that I made a promise. I didn\u2019t tell her what I knew because I wanted to protect the person who told me.\n\nShe called me a petty AH and complained to our friend group. I explained to a few select people the whole story, most agreed with me, but some said that weddings cause people to make very tough decisions that aren\u2019t personal.\n\nNow I\u2019m doubting myself, maybe it wasn\u2019t personal and I\u2019m just being petty, but she did lie to me and uninvited me while still expecting an expensive gift from me.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680130311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1263hvm/aita_for_not_giving_a_wedding_present_i_promised/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
