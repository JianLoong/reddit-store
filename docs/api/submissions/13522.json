I\u2019m not super close to her or her fianc\u00e9, but I love weddings so I said yeah I\u2019ll go.\n\nNow, the relevant part here is that I have a very good career and make an excellent living. Plus I love giving gifts and splurging a bit. So, I spoke with Molly and her fianc\u00e9 and promised them a custom made gaming pc since they game together. They were very happy, and thanked me a lot . The price of the pc would come out to be a little over $1500, not counting the monitor I was willing to throw in.\n\nA two months ago, Molly told me that unfortunately I had to be uninvited to the wedding as part of a cost cutting measure. She apologized, but assured me it was only because of cost. I was upset, but let it go. Then I found out a week or so later from a mutual acquaintance that was still going that Molly told her she had to cut people because she needed the invites for some of the groom\u2019s family who decided to come. I was pissed, so I decided to not give Molly the PC I promised.\nMolly\u2019s wedding happened two weeks ago  and from what I can tell, it was a nice ceremony. Afterward she actually texted me asking if we can talk about when the pc would arrive. I asked if we could call, she said yes. I told her that since I didn\u2019t go to the wedding that I wasn\u2019t going to get her a gift. We had a long argument, where she said I was being petty and that I was holding it against her that I couldn\u2019t come and that I made a promise. I didn\u2019t tell her what I knew because I wanted to protect the person who told me.\n\nShe called me a petty AH and complained to our friend group. I explained to a few select people the whole story, most agreed with me, but some said that weddings cause people to make very tough decisions that aren\u2019t personal.\n\nNow I\u2019m doubting myself, maybe it wasn\u2019t personal and I\u2019m just being petty, but she did lie to me and uninvited me while still expecting an expensive gift from me.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680130311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1263hvm/aita_for_not_giving_a_wedding_present_i_promised/", "score": 3802, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Years back, I had a young woman \"Lisa\" who worked for me. I got engaged and Lisa was invited to my bridal shower and wedding. She didn't attend the shower, but sent a gift. Then, Lisa and her boyfriend came to the wedding and also gave a generous gift. Great - I was glad they were there.\n\nThree years pass. Lisa gets engaged to her boyfriend. At this point, she hadn't worked for me in two years. She was transferred to another department in another part of the building. I'd see her only occasionally and we'd just say \"hi\" as we passed in the halls. \n\nSo, I was not at all surprised when I did not receive an invite to her shower or her wedding. I did contribute to the group office gift that was purchased for her. I was surprised, however, to hear from a co-worker after her wedding that Lisa was \"upset\" with me because I didn't send her a gift for her wedding. Ummm, what? You didn't *invite* me to your wedding, Lisa. No invitation = no gift. Had she invited me, I would likely have declined and sent a gift (I had a young infant at the time and wasn't up for going to late-night events), but she didn't invite me... So, whatevs.", "My cousin and his (now wife) fiancee specifically stated that those coming in from out of town didn't need to bring gifts because their presence was gift enough.

Sure everyone brings a gift... But generally they're 'white' showers - so, towels, sheets, kitchen implements, that kind of thing.

OP is told they are uninvited due to costs, OP goes, 'That sucks, but ok' and still plans to give them the PC. Once OP finds out that the costs are that Molly and Groom can't afford the family members and the five friends, OP got huffy and decided not to get the PC, in essence saying that they had more of a right to be there then the GROOM'S  FAMILY. If after OP was first uninvited they decided not to get the PC, they wouldn't be TA, it's the fact that they were petty and spiteful in deciding not to get the PC because the couple had to make room for family that makes them TA, and honestly, this would be a deal breaker in friendship for me, if someone told me 'no I didn't get you anything because you had to uninvite me because family members were unexpectedly able to come.' It bitter, petty, and spiteful to the core and very main character syndrome of OP, thinking that as an acquaintance, her invite is irreversible to family unexpectedly being able to make it.
