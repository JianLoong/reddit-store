Between work and childcare (six kids aged 5-14), we're absolutely exhausted and wanted to use our anniversary as a short getaway for three days.\r\n\nWith six kids, finding someone who could be a sitter for three full days was a little tricky. Fortunately for us, my youngest brother (Alan, M33) lives pretty close by. Alan and I were born with 6 other siblings and with having so many nieces and nephews, Alan has been staunchly child-free himself. His fianc\u00e9e (Maria, F28) is even more strict about being childfree than he is. According to Alan, she literally describes herself as a \u201cchildfree warrior\u201d and talks a lot about how having children destroys the environment, etc.\r\n\nI was talking to Alan and happened to mention our struggles with finding a babysitter. He scoffed at this and started saying things like how taking care of kids was very easy and parents are often overreacting. I jokingly asked him if that meant he was open to taking care of our kids for a few days. He seemed hesitant, but when I offered $600 in return, he accepted it as \u201ceasy money\u201d. Alan arrived as scheduled on the day of the trip and my husband and I headed off on our vacation.\r\n\nWe returned after 3 days and found everything at home was in order. The kids told us they had a great time with their uncle and Alan (looking more exhausted than I\u2019ve ever seen) said that it was surprisingly enjoyable.\r\n\nFast forward to yesterday and Alan and Maria come by and visit us. We chatted about our trip and Maria seemed, for some reason, to be annoyed. When Alan started talking about how he enjoyed talking to the kids about school and playing basketball with our sons, Maria kept on sighing and doing that exasperated laugh she does when she\u2019s annoyed. She then mentioned how since Alan had babysat for us, he\u2019s been opening up to the idea of having his own children.\r\n\nI said there was nothing wrong with that, but she cut me off and said she didn\u2019t want to get into the \u201cmoral and ethical\u201d implications of having children. It was a really awkward conversation, and I\u2019m happy that none of our children were home to hear it. She even suggested that it was irresponsible of us to let Alan babysit.\n\nWhen they were heading out, Alan apologized to me and my husband (Maria was in his car so she didn\u2019t hear). He said that Maria would be fine and that she was going through her own stress right now and didn\u2019t mean it.\r\n\nFrom the car, I could see Maria giving us the death glare. I told my husband later that I didn\u2019t think we should have gone on vacation since it might affect Alan\u2019s and Maria\u2019s relationship but he said we didn\u2019t do anything wrong and it wasn\u2019t our concern if Maria decided to make herself upset.\r\n\nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1696864483, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173ubvy/aita_for_letting_my_childfree_brother_babysit/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is NOTHING wrong with not wanting children. It's not for everyone - it's a HUGE commitment and many people prefer to have freedom. However being a \"child free warrior\" at 28 freaking years old is a red flag. Pushing your own beliefs onto others to that extreme is NOT normal.\n\nI think Alan was enjoying being a young adult, met Maria and then was committed to the child free lifestyle because he had been striken with fear. If watching six kids for 3 days makes you think about kids, well I'm guessing for sure he's not a child free warrior.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, if anything you did Alan a favor.", "\" I didn\u2019t think we should have gone on vacation since it might affect Alan\u2019s and Maria\u2019s relationship\"\n\nThat's the worst possible take.

And your brother seems a decent human being, let him make his own choices, and definitely ask him again if it seems reasonable - just never pressure him to do so. If his relationship with his nieflings is going to cause friction in his relationship, it might be something Alan is wanting to bring to a head anyway.", "NTA. Alan and Maria\u2019s relationship problems are really and truly not your problem. If Alan has realized he wants or could want kids, fair enough. If Maria has further had her own decision confirmed, also fair. You\u2019ve got bugger all to do with any of it. You just gave them $600 and some serious stuff to think about (actually a favor to them, because imagine if they\u2019d realized this in 10 years time!!)", "As soon as I heard the term \"childfree warrior\", I knew you were NTA.", "NTA. other than your brother clearly enjoying himself while strengthening his relationship with the minis in your family, he got out of his echo chamber just long enough to stretch his opinion. admittedly, i\u2019ve seen the children topic break relationships but it is something that comes up no matter what and has nothing to do with factors external to the couple", "NTA. \n\nYou let a grown man you trust watch your children. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that; plenty of childfree people are excellent babysitters. If Alan is now opening up to the idea of having children because of the time he spent with your kids, which she seems to be very much against, it's not that far fetched to think Maria resents you for it. \n\nThis issue is between them. Alan maybe changing his mind on his childfree stance is nothing bad, and definitely nothing you should be sorry for.", "NTA, but Alan needs to REALLY understand that he got to experience the FUN side of kids.  But he MISSED the sick, whining, picky eating, running to 3-to-6 directions to get them to practice/lessons/birthday parties/doctors appointments/school functions, fun times!\n\nI just had two adorable girls.. and their friends.  I can't imagine keeping up with 6 during the early teen years!\n\nit's not ALL constant fun and games.", "NTA. I don't have children because I just never wanted to.

Maria is pissed off because Alan has revised his view on having kids after having taken care of yours, and is blaming you for the whole thing.  She sounds like a real work of art, being the self-described \"child free warrior\".\n\nOn a related note, I've seen several posts on Reddit recently about how people decide they don't want kids - ever - and that's that.  (One girl was a 20-year-old, and I got raked over the coals by Redditors when I suggested that her view could change over time.)  So, Alan rethinking his position after babysitting the kids is a really good example of how situations change and evolve.", "NTA.

You'd cancel a vacation you and your husband were looking forward to because your BIL's wife is crazy enough to be angry at you for allowing her husband to babysit because, omg, he might find out he enjoys kids.\n\nInsisting on that would have made you the asshole.

You came here to vent.", "NTA....\n\nMy husband and I don't have children either for our own reasons, but have babysat a number of our nieces and nephews frequently. Including for overnights.   \nMaria is going overboard. The way she talks about having children \"ruins the environment, etc\" is ridiculous.   \nI'm not a childfree warrior, I stand on the ground that it's a personal decision and no ones business on why you don't have children.\n\nI'm glad he had fun with his nieces and nephews.  \nI cross my fingers he gets rid of the fiance", "This is about your brother's fiance wanting a childfree lifestyle. And that really has nothing to do with you or your kids. If he's changing his mind about being childfree its because his world view is changing. It happens. And Maria may need to reconsider their future? It might not be viable any longer? And that's fine too. (Maria is a non problem in your life. Don't overthink this. Her issues are on her.)\n\nNTA. I have been watching people's kids since I was like 11. So, while I'd never do that with a kid of my own, I still accept that 33 is more than grown enough to manage children - even six of them. (I think my mother had 6 by the time she was 33, anyway?) \n\nIMO there is nothing complicated about managing my nieces and nephews. There wasn't when I was over 25 and still had no children of my own. (And I too came to want children of my own because of my love for my siblings' children. Its a very natural projection and progression in many of us.)", "NTA. Alan is a consenting adult and even though it could be tiring, he told you he genuinely enjoyed it. Maria is the issue here. Alan can change his mind about having kids. Their marriage may suffer, but you in NO meaning are the reason they are struggling. It seems there is a deeper reason Maria is so annoyed.\n\n Did she baby-sat with Alan on the first time tho? Perhaps it was tiring for her if she was part of this.\n\nHowever It would be nice to double check with Alan if he is still ok on baby-sitting your children on the upcoming vacation.", "I cannot possibly see a way that you would be the AH in this situation. NTA", "NTA- you allowed him to see the other side of the fence.  This is HIS decision to make, and with that he needs to know what having kids is really like and not just have his head filled with weird talk by his girlfriend.\n\nHe is 100% able to deal with his own relationship, its nothing to do with you. But least you know you can count on him to help with the kids if anything should happen.", "NTA you asked and he agreed. That's between you and not a big deal.", "NTA - your brother discovered that kids aren't the evil things he thought they were before. You did nothing wrong in asking him to babysit, and he even enjoyed it. Any difference of opinions is between Alan & Maria.\n\nRelax, Mama, and I hope you enjoyed your child-free vacation", "NTA. Alan's comments about kids not being that hard makes me wonder if he kinda already resented Maria's stance and was just expressing it in a weird way.", "NTA. Everyone makes their choices and what\u2019s right for them but his fianc\u00e9e sounds like a nut for how much she detests children/anyone having them. Also like\u2026.a massive red flag for your brother if he\u2019s now open to possibly having kids but his fianc\u00e9 hates them this much.", "INFO. Did Alan ask Maria before he accepted if it was ok that they take care of your kids?", "NTA (neither is Alan but Maria\u2026\u2026\u2026..) \n\nI wish people could be sensible enough to know that childfree doesn\u2019t mean hating kids or not wanting to spend time with them as family or friends. I\u2019m (m39) and childfree, been snipped since my early 20\u2019s but I love being a part of my friends families with going round for tea and helping her kids with homework or problems they would rather not tell their parents straight away without talking to an adult.", "NTA.  Sounds like there were already cracks in the relationship that were opened up more when Alan discovered he liked spending time with your kids, but that\u2019s not on you.  It\u2019s good that they realize now that they may not be compatible in long term goals, though Maria obviously doesn\u2019t see it that way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hope it works out for you.\" \ud83d\ude02", "Alan lives in the same city as us, Maria lives about a 1.5-hour drive away so she can be closer to her place of work. Alan took care of the kids on his own for the 3-days, but I am unsure if he let her know about that beforehand", "i have a child and the idea of babysitting 6 kids for 3 days sounds like actual hell", "It doesn't alone but her reaction suggests a reasonable amount of control", "The whole question came about because OP *couldn't* find another sitter.", "Why should she find another sitter when her brother was happy to do it?", "There are childfree people. Then there are those that claim they\u2019re childfree, when they\u2019re actually child haters.", "Did Alan stay with the kids at your house or bring them to his place? Not that it would have really impacted Maria either way, it sounds like. But it REALLY wouldn't impact her if he was staying with the kids for a few days in the house the kids are normally at, anyway.", "I know the amount of shit my cousins, sister, and I (5 kids, total age gap: 6.5 years) could pull in a single afternoon once Thanksgiving dinner was done.... much less 1 additional kid and 2.5 extra days.", "Ah.\n\nTry harder. For reals.", "I\u2019m talking future.\n\nMaybe to not add to a conflict in his home. I wouldn\u2019t do that to my brother. I love him.", "Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a sitter for *two* kids, much less *six*?!", "You... wouldn't ask your brother for a favor?", "When a person decides to have 6 children, after having 1, they know what they are in for.\n\nThey can do better."]}
