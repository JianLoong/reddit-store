That's it. Don't glamorize it. That's what makes it weird.", "Absolutely Found Out!!!", "Or when he comes over, you go hang in your restaurant.", "OP served a hot plate of cold revenge.", "My thoughts exactly. \"He's old school\" (he can't evolve?) and don't make waves (let the AH be an AH so we can pretend they're not an AH). Wife needs to grow a backbone.", "Different and complementary fields, IMO.\n\nMy culinary arts student can cook a perfect restaurant-worthy steak, and showed me how.  I, on the other hand, know how to make good soup out of scraps without a recipe, and showed *him* how.", "Yeah it literally means someone who does something for the love of doing it", "A chef basically runs the kitchen, plans the menu, experiments with new dishes, delegates tasks to the other kitchen staff.   A managerial role over the kitchen. \n\nA cook is more someone who follows a recipe (it me!).

You can also have Executive Chefs or Executive Sous Chefs who usually oversee multiple restaurants or food outlets (like at a hotel) with CdCs at each to command the individual teams.    \n   \nMost (almost all?) line cooks have the ability to throw together a dish on their own without a recipe, and in good restaurants they would be encouraged to think creatively for new menu items/specials.", "Be a professional cook and an actual chef are not the same skill sets.", "My job title is Chief Engineer. I tell people who see my business card that I just drive the train.

You must have various knife and preparation skills to be so called. You can get these in one of two ways - either by going to culinary school or by apprenticing under a chef for several years. You cannot simply declare yourself so no matter how long you have worked in a professional kitchen.
