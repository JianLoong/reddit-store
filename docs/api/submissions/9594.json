Shame your wife doesn't have your back.", "NTA. Maybe you should stop cooking such nice food for your wife since she\u2019s not willing to be confrontational with her rude, misogynist father, but seems perfectly content to be confrontational with you, her supportive, feminist husband. She can go over to his house and cook them both dinner every night since it\u2019s women\u2019s work.", "NTA\u2026 wow he sounds like a piece of work", "NTA.\n\nBut I am a bit confused about pairing onions with Bratw\u00fcrste. My first thought was: bold to try something that extravagant with that mamy guests. But well, he is a chef so people will expext that. \n\nWent down a rabbit hole after that reading about American Bratwurst recipies. Please do not cook them in beer with onions. They are supposed to be fried (braten) or better, grilled like OP did. Also it's a waste of beer. \n\nI don't mind the onions and I am not gatekeeping Bratwurst, but please don't cook Bratwurst.", "Lol at your first sentence. Yup, in many cases it is. I had a boss that was \"old school\".", ">\tWhat\u2019s \u201cold school\u201d, a euphemism for asshole?\n\nOh it\u2019s a wonderfully versatile phrase. It can also stand in for sexist or racist or even homophobe. Generally any form of bigot. Isn\u2019t language wonderful", "Maybe don\u2019t have this guy over any more. Or when he comes over, you go hang in your restaurant.", "Or an apprenticeship as a sous chef for several years under a recognized & culinary trained chef.", "Cooking for your in-laws is totally optional.", "Of course you did not make an effort on the meals before.", "It\u2019s easy to point the finger of blame at the FIL, and he definitely deserves a lot of blame for this situation, but the main source of conflict is coming from the wife being completely unwilling to stick up for her husband in any way. \n\nShe\u2019s so far onto her father\u2019s side that she\u2019s demanding OP cook bad food for people who have the basic human decency to just appreciate someone cooking good food for them instead of hurling a bunch of sexist jibes at the person cooking the food.", "working professionally as someone who cooks food makes you a chef. chef is a profession, not a degree", "Yeah but I bet whenever you were on chopped or whatever they called you \u201cchef forsaken order\u201d.", "The way I see it, a person is a chef or not depends on whether there is any leadership involved, since the word means chief or head.", "Disagree.  There are plenty of jobs that are like this.  Lawyers and paralegals might be a good example, or paramedics, nurses and doctors, along with the various other medical roles, teachers and ECE's.  In each of these groups, both roles work within the same domain, and can be gifted at their jobs without suddenly acquiring the title of the other.  In many professional roles you can even go to school, graduate and work without having the right to use the designation until you pass a complicated certification test.  OP seems like a kick ass human, and is NTA, and is also making a meaningful distinction between chef and cook.", "Are you make your money by cooking, right? You are a professional. You just took a different route to get there.", "I took a culinary class in high school and, at least in the States, the difference is that a Chef has formal culinary education/training and cooks learn informally. Both can invent recipes, work in the culinary field professionally, be amazing at what they do, or shitty. \n\nI\u2019m willing to bet that at some point OP spent significant time with someone who by that definition is a chef. Because the difference between the two is obscure enough to make a good jeopardy question.", "Agreed. You're a Chef, just not a traditionally trained one.", "That does make sense as a definition. It's better than my suggestion.", "They can be both Cook and a Chef. But go on, what's your definition? I suppose we should also consult the Oxford English Dictionary, or something equally authoritative, which I haven't yet done."]}
