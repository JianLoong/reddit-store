My kids also have been taking dance since they were 4. My sister (30F) has 2 kids, Alex(13M) and Ella(11F).\n\nI live in a good area which means good school. My sis wanted her kids in that school but she doesn\u2019t wanna drive nor pay for the kid\u2019s tuition so we have an agreement. I have her kids on school days and on Friday-Monday she has her kids. I also pay the tuition.\n\nThe day before winter break I took the kids to an outdoor mall and there was a little dance off, the kids wanted to join so I said ok. I told my kids when going against their cousins to go easy on them. Long story short it comes down to Alice vs Ella. I told Alice go easy, and she agreed but she won. This made Ella upset and she even threw a tantrum in public.\n\nthe next day we got report cards and when this happens my sister comes out here to review them with me, this time she brought my mom. she hasn\u2019t really been supportive of me growing up. when I went to go pickup the kids my oldest was upset. Apparently there was a rumor that she pays teachers to give her good grades. I told her don\u2019t feed into it if it aint true, but she was still upset. She said the rumor started from Alex\u2018s instagram account. I told her we will confront him with his mom and she said ok.\n\nwhen we got home we opened report cards, my kids got good grade and my sisters kids didn\u2019t do so well. they had failing grades. Alex pulled up the rumor of Alice paying the teachers and when I defended her my sister said that I was paying the teacher. \n\nI told them I couldnt do this anymore. And either my sister start paying tuition for her kids or take them and their stuff home with her and dont bring them back. She said that I just wanted an excuse to make her kids sad and have them fail in life. This wasn\u2019t true. Then she started saying I wanted this to send my youngest to a special need\u2019s school. I said she doesn\u2019t need a special needs school And she does just fine where she at and a fight ensued.\n\nMy mom during this fight pulled my youngest aside and told her that this was her fault. she scolded teddie for having adhd and autism apparently ending this conversation with calling her a r\\*t\\*rd.\n\nI ended up kicking them out. later that night I heard my youngest crying. I asked her what was wrong and she apologized to me. she said she was sorry for having adhd, for having autism, and for being different. My wife ended up cheering her up. Telling her she was perfect the way she was and she doesn\u2019t need to change a thing about herself. but now I feel guilty. If I had just stayed quiet maybe My daughter wouldn\u2019t be so upset.

Your family are malicious and entitled. They don't deserve the support you have been offering and they sure as hell don't deserve to be part of your or your children's lives, either.", "NTA With two less kids in the home you can focus on your own kids.  Your kids don't need bullies like Alex living with them or in their school and you know where the rumor ultimately started now, your sister.  The kid overheard it and spread it. It sounds exactly like something your sister and your mother would say.  I would also cut your mother completely out of your child's life.  What grandmother whispers that kind of poison to a child!!!", "NTA your sister and mother and the spoiled unappreciative kids of your sisters are all the AH\u2019s. You need to go NC with them. They\u2019re all toxic. \n\nAny woman, especially a grandmother, that can call a young kid a vulgar slur like that is a bully and  hateful abuser. Your sister is as guilty. They\u2019re all verbally and emotionally abusive. And she\u2019s teaching her children how to be abusive as well. \n\nNot to mention that they\u2019ve been given a generous gift of school tuition, transportation and living accommodations for the school year and they treat their donor/benefactor like garbage. And that\u2019s not even saying anything about you being family. Talk about arrogant, selfish entitled narcissistic behavior.  \n\nYou\u2019ve done enough for the people who have 0 respect for you. It\u2019s time to eliminate them from your family\u2019s life. It\u2019s healthier for them than the abuse they suffered at your sister and her children\u2019s and your mothers behavior. Protect your kids first. And yourself second. And the best part is that can all be done in one action of NC and cutting them out of your lives. \n\nAlso if you read this, Give Teddie a hug from me and my family. She\u2019s perfect the way she is. I have 2 sisters with ADHD too. It\u2019s definitely not her fault and it\u2019s okay to be the way she is.", "No, no no no no!!!!!\n\nNTA!\n\nGod almighty both your mother and sister need to be barred from your life permanently or as close to that as possible!!!\n\nTelling a sweet, innocent child it is their fault for having a disability as a result of a fight escalation? I can hardly even think of lower things to say to a child.\n\nBoth your sister and mother are emotionally abusive and manipulative. Please tell Teddie this, coming from a neuroscientist:\n\nYour differences are actually what will set you apart and make you special. They may make certain things more difficult, but you would be surprised to find out in what ways they may also help and make you shine. It is not Teddie's or anyone's fault that she has autism and ADHD, and she is a beautiful soul to be cherished just as anyone else. \n\nTell her like this: Did she feel any lesser as a person over her disorders until her **BITCH ASS GRANDMA** (I would use softer language when discussing with her) decided to berate her for it?\n\nRemind Teddie that she did not do anything wrong. Remind her of her kindness, and remind her that her grandmother said what she said because she is a bully who was without options. \n\nGrandma couldn't do anything about you standing up for yourself, so she goes for your youngest, most vulnerable child. Disgusting, deplorable, inhumane is an understatement. Your mother is a *monster*.\n\nUnfortunately, your sister likely learned from your mother, and Alex likely learned from your sister. Emotional manipulation cannot be given any leeway. It must be quashed.

While their financial state is unfortunate, you are not obligated to continue to fund two private school tuitions for your sister\u2019s children.

If they cannot treat you and your family with basic respect, they don\u2019t deserve your support", "NTA. Of course! It's even not your responsibility.", "NTA- time to go No contact with your mom. As for your sister she sounds very entitled. It takes more than a good school to teach a child. As a matter of fact the number one determining factor is a child\u2019s success is parent involvement.", "Your mom and sister sound like such delightful people. /s. NTA and you know it. You defended your kids. You should have never told them to take it easy on their cousins though. You obviously don't need to pay your sister's kids' tuition and why have entitled brats in your life and the lives of your children?", "NTA, sounds like you do enough for your sisters kids by basically being their mother 5 times a week.

Seems like assholery runs in the family, though, and you somehow didn't inherit it here.

As for your mother? That needs to be put in the most cheapest nastiest retirement home you can find.", "NTA. \n\nInstead of thinking you should just stay quiet , you should think of going low contact with your sister and your mother. Those entitled people won't do any good for you and your family. your instict should be about protecting your family and not let them cause any harm to your kids. \n\nyou have been generous enough providing for your sister's kids but they are not just ungrateful but spiteful. Time to rethink of your actions", "NTA, please please don't subject your kids to this terrible people, what type of grandma tell that to her grankid? Like wtf. I know I don't have the whole family story, but God I will go NC the moment someone said that to my child", "NTA Effective immediately stop enabling your sister and her kids.

Send them back.", "NTA.\n\nNothing to feel sorry for (except maybe for having such a shitty mom & sis)...\n\nSaying such things to children leaves a very bad impact; get them away from your mom & sis (lc / nc)... out of sight, out of mind...", "NTA, but what you need to do is cut contact with your mother since your mother is emotionally abusing your children. She no longer should have any contact with you or your children period. \n\nYou should also cut contact with your sister and send her children home with her, cuz the situation you are describing is your sister dropping off her kids with you and expecting you to not only take care of them physically but financially because she simply does not want to put in the effort, but is taking the time to fill their heads with the same disrespectful bullshit she serves up to you.\n\nSo you're taking on the responsibility of parenting these children while dealing with them having a bad influence who is teaching them to not only disrespect you and your wife, but actively mistreat your neurodivergent child. You need to disconnect and protect your kids", "Woah no OP NTA infact your youngest now will be able to share problems you even in the future because she trusts that you and your wife will be there with her no matter what.

I am so sorry your children have been hurt by these people!

This should have been an adults only conversation or you should have pulled the offendjng kid into a room with the adults ro discuss what they did. This whole situation sucks. Also, if these kids basically live with you monday-friday, why don't you discuss it with the kid who was a being a jerk. And I have no clue what the dance situation has to do with anything. It's very normal for an 11 year old to have meltdowns. It's very normal for 11-13 year olds to be jerks and it's on the adults to work together to figure out how to fix that and address it.
