Someone's baby is calling my boyfriend \"Da-Da,\" and I told him that I'm not comfortable with the mother of said baby being a part of our life.\n\nA little backstory: I am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend. I met my bf while on vacation and, at the time, he was living pretty much alone as the people he lived with (A 40+ year old couple) were always away for work\u2026 Until the couple's daughter and her baby moved in with my bf. At first, over the phone, she seemed friendly enough. However, when I went to visit, and met her for the first time, she openly kept calling my bf \"Baby Daddy.\u201d Mind you, she does have a baby but the baby's father is in jail. Anyways, this repetitive comment made me uncomfortable and I felt disrespected, but she assured me that she meant no harm. Over time, I got frustrated.\n\nShe would do things that I felt were disrespectful to our relationship. For example, she would often walk into his room and have 30min-1hr long conversations with my bf while I was on the phone with him. (Side note: these conversations were in Spanish, as Spanish is my bf\u2019s first language. So I had no idea what they talked about). She would also ask him to take care of the baby while he was on the phone. Often, the baby would scream-cry for the majority of the time we were on the phone if her mother left her there. I mentioned to my bf that some of her actions made me uncomfortable, and he kept brushing it off as her being a friendly roommate.\n\nHere was my breaking point: My bf sent me a video showing his new haircut. In this video he is holding the girl's baby, who keeps calling \"Da-Da\" to get his attention. I mentioned this made me feel uncomfortable, as someone had to have taught the baby to call him that. The dad's baby is not in her life. So, without someone teaching her, she would have never even heard the word to learn it. I had a conversation with him about how I felt. Yet, the girl he lives with continues to disrespect me and encourage her daughter to call MY boyfriend \"Da-Da.\" The baby is a year old now and that is how she refers to him, as this behavior was never corrected. \n\nMy bf and I are finally moving in together this week. I'm uprooting my whole life (leaving my family, friends, and school) and moving to a state 7.5hrs away, where I don't know anyone except him.\nI had a conversation with him and told him that I don't feel comfortable with the baby's mom being a part of our life. Now that he is moving out, I don't see a reason why I should have to be around her. I feel that she has consistently crossed my boundaries and disrespected me, and I don't want to see or talk to her now that it's not required. He was upset by this. He said that he cares a lot for the baby and loves the baby, therefore he wants the baby and her mother to be a part of his life (and therefore, mine).\n\nAm I overreacting? Am I the asshole for suggesting that the baby's mother shouldn't be a part of our life?", "created_utc": 1687071692, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cdnea/aita_her_baby_is_calling_my_boyfriend_dada/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I felt disrespected by her baby calling my boyfriend \u201cDa-Da,\u201d among other things.

I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m in the right and cutting off the baby\u2019s mom is fair, as conversations about my feelings didn\u2019t help.

Now he wants to move in with you 7.5 hours away from your family and friends to another state, where you know no one but him, the woman, and the baby, and have no support system.

For now the judgement is NAH", "NTA. Oh hell no! Baby mama wants him. Paternity test is probably a good idea.

Helping a roomate out with caretaking is different to being a dad and being forever tied to a child. \n\nIf he was completely honest, he should have said \"I view this kid as my own and want to take on the father role.\" Maybe he said that and it was left out in the story, but the way the story reads it does not sound like he was that clear with his intentions.\n\nBesides that, having and taking care of a child is one thing. But being closely tied to the child's mother, living with her under a roof and having conversations with her for hours is quite another thing. Is does raise the valid question which of the two women he wants to spend his life with. Does he want to take on the father role AND be tightly companioned with the child's mother? Then maybe there is no room for a second woman in his life. At least not one who repeatedly tells him how uncomfortable his lack of boundaries makes her.", "So are you the boyfriend or his \"roommate\"?", "So many comments - seems like you\u2019re very invested. If you\u2019re the mother of the baby then you need to pull your head in - ops boyfriend is not the father, will never be the father and a bit of distance between him and the child would be healthy all round.", "And you are still going on. Stop brigading this post.", ":)", "I have a beautiful son and another baby on the way with my partner. I know what a blessing a child is and how a connection can be formed. :)", "Are you the roommate? You keep commenting on all the comments defending the roommate.", "ALL Of this is well and nice. But they are going from long distance to moving in together. And OP is an AH for NOT adressing the issue BEFORE moving in. She KNOWS that is the situation - he did not hide anything - and she is accepting it by moving in. - The reasonable approach would have been to TALK To her partner BEFORE moving. But she likely did not do that because he might have said NO - she expects him to knuckle under just because she will be there - and she will get her surprise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut in the end, she is mosty doing this to herself anyway. SHE is moving to another state, and SHE will be the one alone without friends and without a relationship when she suddenly starts harassing her partner fpr relationships she PRETENDED to be ok with.", "Did you even read what I said???", "Hello.

Sorry I misunderstood. I definitely should have mentioned in my post - My boyfriend is black (very dark complexion). The woman\u2019s baby is whiter than a sheet of paper. I haven\u2019t even thought about asking him for a DNA test because the probability of him producing such a white baby seems low to me.", ">I don't understand what I just read. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah. I can explain it to you, but you would have to understand it yourself.", "Because it's not actually his kid and she's been telling him she's not comfortable with it and he probably told her stuff to reassure that it will stop.", "Info why are you all over this comment section basically insisting that OP\u2019s bf is the baby daddy when he isn\u2019t??", "ITS NOT HIS CHILD", "INFO: did you read the post or?", "I get your point and don't find this view completely wrong. \n\nBut I want to address:\n\n>She had the option to discuss it, or tell him she was not ok with that.\n\nShe did discuss it. Told him several times that she sees boundaries crossed and that it makes her uncomfortable. We don't know how the bf reacted in those discussions though, and how open and honest he was about his intentions.\n\nEdit:\n>WHY would OP expect that to change?\n\nBecause bf said he was just helping his roomate out and OP hoped the dynamic would change when they move in somewhere else together.\n\n\n\nI still don't think OP is the asshole for not wanting the child in her life. But again, I get your point. Like the first commentor said, the only reasonable thing for her to do is to not move in with the guy, since it would only make her unhappy.", "This is not about the baby mama.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is about not respecting her partner's choices - and ending up alone and withoutfriends after moivng to another state.
