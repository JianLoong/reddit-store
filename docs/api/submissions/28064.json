{"id": 28064, "submission_id": "16xzm18", "title": "AITA for having my brother & SIL stay in our daughter\u2019s room when they visit at Thanksgiving?", "selftext": "My first time making a post like this. I will try to keep it brief, but descriptive. \nMy husband (26m) and I (26f) recently bought a house. It\u2019s a 4 bedroom, 3 bath. It\u2019s a large house and the bedrooms are decently sized. \nWe have 3 kids so each of our kids gets a room. Daughter is 8, oldest son is 6, youngest is 4. They all share the upstairs bathroom. My husband and I have the master bedroom and bathroom. \nMy brother and his wife, along with their 1 year old son, are visiting for Thanksgiving for 2 weeks.\nWe told them we would give them our daughters room as it\u2019s the largest and has a queen sized bed. Our daughter will just sleep in one of our sons\u2019 rooms. We were planning on making it look really nice in there for them. Giving them new sheets and bedding, making sure that all of my daughters things are put away, etc.\n\nAnyway, my mother says that my husband and I are being extremely rude and inconsiderate for not giving them our master bedroom and bathroom. She said it\u2019s just not right that they will have to share the upstairs bathroom with our kids while they\u2019re here. I honestly did not think we were being inconsiderate at all. \nMy brother was very happy when I told him they could stay with us, because they wouldn\u2019t have to pay for a hotel/Airbnb. He didn\u2019t seem at all like he minded they would be in our daughters room. \n\nAITA??\n\nEdit to add a bit more background: My parents and my brother and his family both live across the country. My sister and her husband, along with my family, live within 30 minutes from each other. We decided that we are having Thanksgiving here. So my sister is having my parents stay with her. \nTo put it nicely, my sister is a suck up. Always has been with my mom. So she offered for my parents to stay in their master bedroom and my sister and her husband will stay in their other bedroom. \n\nI feel like that bit of information might be pertinent to this. Just because I think my mom is basically implying that my husband and I are not being as accommodating as my sister is towards them.\n\n2nd edit: My daughter and I talked and she told me she is fine giving up her room for the 2 weeks. She is so excited to see them and she said it\u2019s not a big deal to her. My daughter is 8, oldest son is 6 and youngest is 4. \nOldest son has a twin bed in his room, youngest has a bunk bed in his room from when the boys shared a room in our old house. \nI am giving my brother & SIL our daughters room since it\u2019s largest and has a queen bed. I am probably going to have my two sons just sleep together with the bunk bed. And then put my daughter in the room with the twin bed. So she at least has her own space and privacy.\n\nLastly, yes 2 weeks is a long time lol. But my brother and I are very close and we only get to see his family about once a year. It\u2019s a sacrifice and of course it can be stressful. But my whole family is so excited for them to be with us.\n\n\nI wanted to say thank you for all of the feedback everybody! I genuinely was worried that I was being inconsiderate or not a good host. So thank you for the resounding NTA feedback. I think my mother is just being extra delusional and wants to have a say in every single thing that goes on in the family. I\u2019m going to stick to my guns and just tell her that if she is seriously that concerned about it, she could always get them a nice hotel or Airbnb!?", "created_utc": 1696260448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xzm18/aita_for_having_my_brother_sil_stay_in_our/", "score": 2318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No rules of etiquette include giving up your own bed. Simply tell her (don\u2019t negotiate!!!) that your bedroom will be occupied, but your daughter will **graciously** make hers available. If she tries to talk you into changing your mind, just go on auto-repeat, even using exactly the same response over and over, with a smile on your face.\n\nMy guess would be you have a history of caving to your mother, so that is now her expectation.

To give guests the master bed + bath? Cause where I'm from this is NOT a thing. \n\nGuests stay in guest rooms if the house has one, or some other room that can be made available - perhaps a child's bedroom, or a den/basement situation.

That is uncomfortable on so many levels!!", "Nta sounds like you got it worked out nicely for everyone actually involved", "NTA- They are guests and you can accommodate.

We decided it was the best option and you don't need to know the specifics why as it doesn't involve you\"", "NTA\n\nWho cares. If they don\u2019t like it they don\u2019t have to stay.

You have a whole other bedroom, with a queen sized bed! AWESOME! \n\nIt's really about what is available. Not everyone has a guest room anymore.

But for cultures or families with a lot of reverence for parents/older relatives, it\u2019s an expected sign of respect. Also seems to be a thing where older generations tend to expect this sort of thing, where younger folks don\u2019t, likely because children\u2019s sleeping arrangements in older generations weren\u2019t as comfortable as they are today.

I will try to keep it brief, but descriptive. \nMy husband (26m) and I (26f) recently bought a house. It\u2019s a 4 bedroom, 3 bath. It\u2019s a large house and the bedrooms are decently sized. \nWe have 3 kids so each of our kids gets a room. They all share the upstairs bathroom.

Our daughter will just sleep in one of our sons\u2019 rooms. We were planning on making it look really nice in there for them. Giving them new sheets and bedding, making sure that all of my daughters things are put away, etc.\n\nAnyway, my mother says that my husband and I are being extremely rude and inconsiderate for not giving them our master bedroom and bathroom. She said it\u2019s just not right that they will have to share the upstairs bathroom with our kids while they\u2019re here. I honestly did not think we were being inconsiderate at all. \nMy brother was very happy when I told him they could stay with us, because they wouldn\u2019t have to pay for a hotel/Airbnb.

Now you've got me all nostalgic too xD", "We used to go to my aunt and uncle's dairy farm every summer. My cousins gave up their room for my sister and I. I don't remember where they slept.

Good lord.", "Please tell me what hotel has 5 layers of bed sheets? I have stayed in many, even 5 stars and have never seen 5 bed sheets", "Um...no, they don't.

You don't think sweat and other body fluids soak through layers of sheets? You think they just peel back one layer and it's ready for the next guest? Yuck! Nope...that's not how it works. If you stay regularly at a hotel that does this then they probably are due for a surprise inspection from the health department. Gross.", "Read the edits. You\u2019re taking a hard line based on a bunch of your assumptions when it wasn\u2019t presented as an option for a reason. Perhaps they can\u2019t afford it or are compromising so that visiting family doesn\u2019t cost $2000 in hotel stays and they all want to see each other for that long. Not to mention transportation or rental cars to and from. Even if they couldn\u2019t afford it, I would ABSOLUTELY offer one of my four bedrooms to my family who are flying across the country to spend the holidays together, and I would hope that if feasible they\u2019d offer the same the next year when we do it at their house. Even if the hotel is close, they\u2019d have much more time together during one of few opportunities they get to spend it by staying together rather than shuttling back and forth to the hotel and bringing all their things back and forth so they can hang out all day. Not to mention causing a family get together to burn that much money. That\u2019s what families do - they make small sacrifices so they can spend time with each other without costing each other a fortune. And given the edits, this IS a small sacrifice the whole family is excited to make.\n\nThe stabbing thing is absurd. Putting the daughter out of her room is comparable to stabbing?
