{"id": 28064, "submission_id": "16xzm18", "title": "AITA for having my brother & SIL stay in our daughter\u2019s room when they visit at Thanksgiving?", "selftext": "My first time making a post like this. I will try to keep it brief, but descriptive. \nMy husband (26m) and I (26f) recently bought a house. It\u2019s a 4 bedroom, 3 bath. It\u2019s a large house and the bedrooms are decently sized. \nWe have 3 kids so each of our kids gets a room. Daughter is 8, oldest son is 6, youngest is 4. They all share the upstairs bathroom. My husband and I have the master bedroom and bathroom. \nMy brother and his wife, along with their 1 year old son, are visiting for Thanksgiving for 2 weeks.\nWe told them we would give them our daughters room as it\u2019s the largest and has a queen sized bed. Our daughter will just sleep in one of our sons\u2019 rooms. We were planning on making it look really nice in there for them. Giving them new sheets and bedding, making sure that all of my daughters things are put away, etc.\n\nAnyway, my mother says that my husband and I are being extremely rude and inconsiderate for not giving them our master bedroom and bathroom. She said it\u2019s just not right that they will have to share the upstairs bathroom with our kids while they\u2019re here. I honestly did not think we were being inconsiderate at all. \nMy brother was very happy when I told him they could stay with us, because they wouldn\u2019t have to pay for a hotel/Airbnb. He didn\u2019t seem at all like he minded they would be in our daughters room. \n\nAITA??\n\nEdit to add a bit more background: My parents and my brother and his family both live across the country. My sister and her husband, along with my family, live within 30 minutes from each other. We decided that we are having Thanksgiving here. So my sister is having my parents stay with her. \nTo put it nicely, my sister is a suck up. Always has been with my mom. So she offered for my parents to stay in their master bedroom and my sister and her husband will stay in their other bedroom. \n\nI feel like that bit of information might be pertinent to this. Just because I think my mom is basically implying that my husband and I are not being as accommodating as my sister is towards them.\n\n2nd edit: My daughter and I talked and she told me she is fine giving up her room for the 2 weeks. She is so excited to see them and she said it\u2019s not a big deal to her. My daughter is 8, oldest son is 6 and youngest is 4. \nOldest son has a twin bed in his room, youngest has a bunk bed in his room from when the boys shared a room in our old house. \nI am giving my brother & SIL our daughters room since it\u2019s largest and has a queen bed. I am probably going to have my two sons just sleep together with the bunk bed. And then put my daughter in the room with the twin bed. So she at least has her own space and privacy.\n\nLastly, yes 2 weeks is a long time lol. But my brother and I are very close and we only get to see his family about once a year. It\u2019s a sacrifice and of course it can be stressful. But my whole family is so excited for them to be with us.", "created_utc": 1696260448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xzm18/aita_for_having_my_brother_sil_stay_in_our/", "score": 481, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No rules of etiquette include giving up your own bed. Simply tell her (don\u2019t negotiate!!!) that your bedroom will be occupied, but your daughter will **graciously** make hers available. If she tries to talk you into changing your mind, just go on auto-repeat, even using exactly the same response over and over, with a smile on your face.\n\nMy guess would be you have a history of caving to your mother, so that is now her expectation.

To give guests the master bed + bath? Cause where I'm from this is NOT a thing. \n\nGuests stay in guest rooms if the house has one, or some other room that can be made available - perhaps a child's bedroom, or a den/basement situation.

Master bedrooms are for the couple that owns the house.  Your mom is out of line.\n\nI've seen on here  that in some Eastern cultures, that's not the case, and I'm not judging that situation at all.  I am assuming this post is about a Western country.\n\nYour sister can be a suck up all she wants.  that doesn't mean you have to. Does your mom give  up her bed room when you visit with your 3 kids?  I'm betting no.", "NTA my parents did the same thing when I was a kid. its pretty normal and the mom is just being demanding.", "NTA!! Nobody in their right mind gives the master bedroom !

He knows that he's saving money by staying with you guys and he's grateful. Your mom needs to mind her own business.

Your brother is happy.\n\nIgnore your mother.", "NTA you are giving them a perfectly good room for free. If they are not happy there are hotels and air b&b\u2019s they could stay at and is you daughter okay with this or did you just tell her tough luck your room is needed.

We decided it was the best option and you don't need to know the specifics why as it doesn't involve you\"", "NTA\n\nWho cares. If they don\u2019t like it they don\u2019t have to stay.

You have a whole other bedroom, with a queen sized bed! AWESOME! \n\nIt's really about what is available. Not everyone has a guest room anymore.

Our daughter will just sleep in one of our sons\u2019 rooms. We were planning on making it look really nice in there for them. Giving them new sheets and bedding, making sure that all of my daughters things are put away, etc.\n\nAnyway, my mother says that my husband and I are being extremely rude and inconsiderate for not giving them our master bedroom and bathroom. She said it\u2019s just not right that they will have to share the upstairs bathroom with our kids while they\u2019re here. I honestly did not think we were being inconsiderate at all. \nMy brother was very happy when I told him they could stay with us, because they wouldn\u2019t have to pay for a hotel/Airbnb.

Your mom needs to zip it. She\u2019s gotta stop sticking her nose in your personal family life. Especially when it doesn\u2019t even concern her. It\u2019s none of her damn business.", "My daughter was around 8 and shared a room with her brother who was 6 at the time  when my parents lived with us for a few months while house shopping. They had a few fall through with inspections during the big boom.They had moved cross country to us and my kids were just excited to live near them at all ( military). Rooms are for sleeping so no TV or Computers. Neither cared as it was temporary.", "I think they are saying it is nasty because they may have sex in your daughters bed though I would hope adults would be mature enough not to do so.", "Hotels have like 5 layers of sheets. It\u2019s not one sheet them mattress.", "And yet she was kind enough to share that info with us!", "I\u2019m very impressed! Accomplishing that while having three kids is major.", "NC. Not deceased. In any event, not a loss.", "Yea I have very fond memories of sharing an attic with my brother and cousins in my grandparent's house during a Chinese New Year celebration. All us kids got wrangled up to the attic while the adults stayed up late to party downstairs. We had so much fun exploring the stuff that was stored in the attic and creating blanket tents. Now you've got me all nostalgic too xD", "We used to go to my aunt and uncle's dairy farm every summer. My cousins gave up their room for my sister and I. I don't remember where they slept. Or my parents, maybe a pullout in the living room. The water was gross, it smelled, only had raw milk to drink. Best memories of my childhood \u2764", "So it was a kind offer.  Your uncomfyness is yours.", "Happy Cake \ud83c\udf82 Day!", "Your uncomfyness is yours.", "Half of these apply to the couple staying on the child\u2019s bed. I don\u2019t trust any couple enough to stay celibate for two weeks. OP doesn\u2019t have an extra room. They need a hotel.", "I didn\u2019t say put them up in your own room. I said she doesn\u2019t have room to put them up.", "Oh someone has the rule book!  \n\nPlease share it!  \ud83d\ude44", "I was thinking the same, but for all 3 kids. They're all being accommodating in this musical beds situation, and they are being very gracious about it, especially for their ages!", "OP, This!  Praise your little munchkins for being so good during an abnormal bedroom situation.", "Or a normal Kid who doesn\u2019t care about such things.    Good lord.", "Please tell me what hotel has 5 layers of bed sheets? I have stayed in many, even 5 stars and have never seen 5 bed sheets", "Um...no, they don't. I worked in an upper-tier hotel for over a decade and they make the beds just like anyone else would. Putting more than one set of sheets on a bed at the same time would make absolutely no sense. They would just have to take all the sheets off between guests and wash them all.", "They have a 1 year old baby.  I assure you that 2 weeks is far from the longest time they've not had sex LOL.  Plus,  said baby will be I'm the room with them... it won't be hard for them to keep their hands to themselves.", "That wasn\u2019t presented as an option. I agree with you about the celibacy, but if they\u2019re staying in the house, it would be much weirder to accept the master for two weeks. And by \u201chalf of these\u201d you only mean #1 right?", "It\u2019s amusing to me that people are so bent out of shape about a couple staying in a kid\u2019s bed. Even if they did have sex, the sheets will very likely be washed before the daughter sleeps in her bed again. Think about hotel beds! Or really any surface in a hotel \ud83d\ude02 Anyway, I LOVED getting to camp out in the dining room when family came and slept in my room. It was fun for me and gave them privacy/comfort while staying with our family.", "Best Western is where I usually stay. It\u2019s so many layers. Nothing is getting to the mattress.", "1&4 It\u2019s imposing to kick a child out of their room as well. (Though I guess it depends on who asked who.)\n\nIf you agree with me about the celibacy then WHY are you ok with this. It\u2019s an option in reality. Doesn\u2019t matter if OP gave that option, it exists. Like if someone said AITA should I rob my upstairs neighbor or stab my downstairs neighbor the answer is Y T A do neither, even if that wasn\u2019t presented as an option.", "I have stayed at quite a few Best Westerns, Washington, Oregon, California, Texas and Florida and I have never seen  5 layers. One layer, yes. Some places will put on a mattress\u2019s a mattress cover/protector.", "If you think that is sanitary then I'd hate to see your home. Yuck. You don't think sweat and other body fluids soak through layers of sheets? You think they just peel back one layer and it's ready for the next guest? Yuck! Nope...that's not how it works. If you stay regularly at a hotel that does this then they probably are due for a surprise inspection from the health department. Gross.", "Read the edits. You\u2019re taking a hard line based on a bunch of your assumptions when it wasn\u2019t presented as an option for a reason. Perhaps they can\u2019t afford it or are compromising so that visiting family doesn\u2019t cost $2000 in hotel stays and they all want to see each other for that long. Not to mention transportation or rental cars to and from. Even if they couldn\u2019t afford it, I would ABSOLUTELY offer one of my four bedrooms to my family who are flying across the country to spend the holidays together, and I would hope that if feasible they\u2019d offer the same the next year when we do it at their house. Even if the hotel is close, they\u2019d have much more time together during one of few opportunities they get to spend it by staying together rather than shuttling back and forth to the hotel and bringing all their things back and forth so they can hang out all day. Not to mention causing a family get together to burn that much money. That\u2019s what families do - they make small sacrifices so they can spend time with each other without costing each other a fortune. And given the edits, this IS a small sacrifice the whole family is excited to make.\n\nThe stabbing thing is absurd. Putting the daughter out of her room is comparable to stabbing? You\u2019re not being reasonable. I get you\u2019re doing it to make a point, but it\u2019s like calling someone Hitler for being firm on something, it\u2019s just not in the same conversation and you lost all credibility with me by going there.", "Ok well that\u2019s just an argument not to use hotels. It\u2019s not an argument to let couples f in your child\u2019s bed.", "In theory they take off all the layers\u2026 (two sheets, comforter, blanket, white cover) \n\nAnd if cum is soaking through one sheet to the next sheet then it\u2019s soaking through one sheet to the mattress.", "Most adults would have the sense to not fuck in a child's bed."]}
