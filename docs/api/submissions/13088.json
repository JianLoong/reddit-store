The only reason I could really get behind would be service dog, in which case many countries will have an exception to quarantine for actual registered service dogs, but there is a ton of paperwork to be done in advance.\n\nEDIT: I am thinking of island nations in this comment, not all counties. I should have been much clearer.\n\nI am assuming this destination wedding is on an island.", "Maybe it\u2019s equivalent to the cost of boarding. Not every pet owner is comfortable with boarding for there a lot of stories of neglect.", "Probably the dog mom type that thinks her dog is equivalent to having a human infant", "So they don't have to stay at the same resort as mom ;)", "I\u2019m not arguing for or against OP because I don\u2019t have all the info, but there are valid reasons why this isn\u2019t always possible:\n\nA dog-aggressive dog may not be accepted at a boarding kennel, more of which are moving to a social/daycare model.\n\nAn intact dog won\u2019t be accepted at a boarding kennel past a certain age. (One of mine is ineligible to board for this reason; that will change when he\u2019s old enough to neuter.)\n\nDogs that are fearful and/or human-reactive are often a poor fit for a boarding kennel, for their own wellbeing and that of staff. (My other dog is fearful and would stress himself into oblivion in a kennel environment; he can\u2019t be boarded either.)\n\nSome breeds are restricted due to the kennel\u2019s insurance (unfortunate but still reality). Some breeds may be too much for a typical dog sitter to handle (I would be very careful about leaving a Fila Bras\u00edlio with anyone).\n\nSome dogs have health issues that make it difficult to board them or leave them with a sitter.\n\nIt REALLY sucks to look at your dog and realize, *I have nowhere to leave this dog if I have to leave town.* My fearful dog is actually a super car traveler and is good in a crate, so I could go somewhere WITH him and crate him at an Airbnb. That\u2019s what we do when we visit family who don\u2019t like dogs. We just limit or split the amount of time we leave them.

I highly suggest not doing that\u2026 it sounds like you are leaving the country so you will have to go to not just a normal vet, but a specially accredited vet to sign off on health documents.  Then those health documents have to be sent to a governmental agency that deals with animals/agriculture to sign off on those for just one part of the travel documents. Oh, and that health cert could be valid for 30 days, or for 72 hours (depending on the country you are going to and where you are coming from), so it\u2019s always nice to sweat out the mail sending you your official documents right before your flight.\n\nDepending on the location there could be permits needed, or a designated quarantine time period once you arrive, or if your going to Hawaii the absolute craziest rabies check that you have ever seen (Hawaii is rabies free and plans to stay that way)\n\nMany airlines will also force you to use a pet travel agency (since it is so damn complicated to ship animals internationally and if just anyone tried it they would fuck up and get their pet stuck in customs), and the lowest quote I\u2019ve seen is $1500 for a small trip, one way.  Even though your pet is 10lbs and could sit on your lap on a domestic flight, some countries, like the UK, have regulations that say your dog cannot ride in the cabin, they would be in a crate in the baggage hold no matter the size, And crate regulations/checking in your dog to the cargo hold is a whole other story \n\nIt\u2019s expensive, a massive headache, and absolutely no one understands the process before they start is and easily get overwhelmed by all the little things you have to do.

I know dogs are family and all, but we are talking about a literal animal over your relationship with your sister and family. \n\nA wedding is a big deal, and it sounds like they are spending a lot of money to have their guests be comfortable at their destination wedding resort.

I flew a dog this way one time and I believe it contributed a lot to his now 13 year long anxiety streak. If you fly with a pet buy them a spot in the cabin. And as someone else mentioned you\u2019ll have to make sure the country you\u2019re going to and the country you\u2019re going home to will allow animals to cross the border without quarantine, otherwise you may be leaving your dog alone for several weeks/months for quarantine.

Outside, she does her business much more quickly and then immediately tries to crawl back into her crate rather than go for a walk!As for the flight- I once flew in the middle seat for a 7 hour journey, and when I pulled her crate out at the end of the flight, the people next to me were actually shocked there was a dog there the whole time because they hadn\u2019t even realized.

Similarly, I have some go-to friends my pup can stay with because they LOVE having her, but even just getting her to them and picking her up is a bigger pain in the ass than just flying with her. Leaving her in a kennel would be really ruff (sorry) for her because she gets overwhelmed and stressed around a lot of other dogs, and does better one-on-one.\n\nNaturally there are also other more extreme concerns about the potential dangers of kennels or people you barely know taking care of your dog, especially when you\u2019re far away.\n\nI don\u2019t see anything wrong with nor weird about someone choosing to travel with their dog if they can do so easily.

Possibly jealous because dogs are easier? They just don\u2019t get that you can care about your pet and want to spend time with them because you enjoy their company. Just because I love my dog and don\u2019t trust strangers to care for her doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a replacement kid or equivalent to an infant. I don\u2019t want kids, I want the dog. I can leave the dog home alone for a few hours, it doesn\u2019t need constant care or attention. How can I be using it as a replacement or think its equivalent to something I don\u2019t want? lol I prefer the dog because it\u2019s not like an infant. Not because it\u2019s a replacement/equivalent anything. \n\nIts almost ironic because if pet sitting was as safe or as regulated as daycare or babysitting - most pet parents would be more comfortable using it. But it\u2019s not, so we end up having to travel with the pets. Then you get assholes thinking just because you want to travel with your pet you somehow think it\u2019s an infant. They have to turn everything into a competition and can\u2019t just let people live how they want to live. It\u2019s like when you mention being tired around a parent and they have to turn it into the tired olympics, give themselves the gold and push everyone else off the podium. lol\n\nAgree with the plane thing, a pet in cargo is just as scary and dangerous as boarding.

It can be done, but in my experience most owners do not understand proper import/export procedures, even traveling between states. I\u2019m a veterinarian who used to write health certificates for animals needing to travel, and I no longer do it because it\u2019s not worth the headache for how little clients pay, especially when they try to bully me into falsifying medical records because they don\u2019t think the rules apply to them.\n\nAustralia is not the only place with a long quarantine. Hawaii does as well, even if the animal currently lives in another state in the US. There are many countries with strict rules. At least part of it has to do with their Rabies\u2019 free status.
