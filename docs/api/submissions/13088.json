Just weird. I guess if you\u2019re actively trying to see your family as little as possible and avoid having to hang out with them outside of the wedding it makes sense, but just really unusual and strange.", "INFO: Have you checked with that nation\u2019s rules about allowing foreign animals in & have you checked with your home country\u2019s rules about allowing your animal\u2019s re-entry? \n\nSome countries require a strict quarantine on animals. \n\nAside from that, though. YTA kind of. I mean, it\u2019s a family event & you\u2019re going but only seeing anyone at the actual wedding. Unless you\u2019re actively trying to avoid your family because you don\u2019t like them, leave your pup at home.", "NTA. But I'm really confused as to why you want to bring your dog...to a wedding...that you have to fly to. Weird to me, but you do you.", "Slight YTA. It's strange that as the sibling of the bride you are choosing your dog over spending time with her and the family at a destination wedding. If the resort gave you more than a one day pass it would be different, but at destination weddings part of the fun is having all of your loved ones in the same place. Even if you don't spend every minute together, it's nice to grab a meal together at night, etc. You literally won't see them outside the wedding if you do this, which is odd to me personally. Just have someone dog sit, it's a few days.", "INFO: Have you seen the schedule of events for the wedding? Are there events you will be missing by being unable to get a guest pass? Just because you have an experience at a previous wedding where the only event is the wedding doesn't mean that would be the case here.", "YTA just leave the poor dog with a sitter at home instead of stressing it out with unnecessary travel and actually spend time with your human family.", "INFO: Are there specific reasons the dog can't be with a sitter at home or do you just want it with you?", "YTA. This is about your sister. Stop being weird.", "Info: are you involved as a wedding party member at all?", "YTA. There are only 2 ways you can get that dog to the location:\n1. By unnecessarily crating it below the plane where it\u2019ll be uncomfortable, cold, alone and stressed for hours. Also considering your dog is only 10 pounds, this could be detrimental to its health. OR\n2. By getting a bogus service dog permit/vest and actually bringing it on the plane with you. Which would be insulting to people who truly need service animals, whereas you just want to take your pet somewhere it has no business going\n\nYour dog is not the full extent of your personality (I hope). Leave it at home where it\u2019ll be happier and safer, and enjoy the time with your family.", "INFO Does your dog talk? and follow up will he be giving a speech at the wedding?", "Info: where is the dog flying (in cabin or cargo)? How long will you be at this wedding?", "YTA, sort of.  \n\nThe purpose of the trip is the wedding.  \n\nIt seems sort of cruel to bring a pet due to stress to the pet  associated with international travel, especially if by plane.  Since you have to leave the dog with a sitter anyway,.it seems much kinder to leave your pet with a pet sitter in your country, to avoid stress on the pet and extra expenses associated with traveling with a pet.\n\nAlso leaving the pet allows you to stay at the resort with everyone else.  It just seems as though you are adding alot of uneccessary stress to yourself (and to your pet) by bringing them to a different country for a wedding.", "YTA Leave the dog home and get a sitter or board the dog. No need to bring it to the resort with you. Go spend time with your family.", "I guess NTA. But it is for-sure, weird how y\u2019all can\u2019t just leave the dog at a dog hotel back home and not even have to worry about it.", "INFO--are you paying for the entirety of the costs associated with traveling, resort fees, attending the wedding, etc? Or are any of the associated fees being covered by your sister or other members of your family? \n\nIf some or all of the cost is being covered by your family, then YTA, definitely. \n\nIf you're paying for everything yourself, you're still being kind of an immature jerk but not a full asshole.", "NTA\n\nI would leave the dog with a sitter at home, stay at the other resort, lie to my family about having a dog and not being able to stay with them or see them much, and then go off and do my own thing, only seeing my family at the wedding and reception. But, that's me.", "Considering how many small pets die on airplanes annually, your dog will be safer at home or in a kennel for the duration. I can't imagine stressing about my pet's survival for something as short and nonessential as a wedding. YTA.", "NTA- that doesn\u2019t work for us is all you need to say.", "NTA technically. You had special accommodations and you made it work. BUT are you those hyper dog mom people? Like why on earth couldn\u2019t you just leave the dog at home? The dog doesn\u2019t need to come to a wedding I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA - but your dog is going to be left alone for too long while you do family stuff.  I realize you said there was daycare, but there are issues you might not forsee with that - like they close it - someone is sick etc..  Leave the dog home with a trusted pet sitter and go enjoy the family time - you only get to do it this one time.", "If you're not part of the wedding party, I see no issue with this arrangement. That being said, if you are part of the wedding party it would be best to stay at the same resort just for day of wedding prep. Trust me, day of is a b!t\u00a2h before the event is in full swing.\n\nYou don't need to be up your family's ass the whole time. What are you really missing at this hotel vs the one you're planning on staying at, besides your family?

You\u2019re trying to snake a vacay out of your sisters wedding, go to your sisters wedding and be present with your family, the dogs presence is not worth missing the majority of family time at the resort.

I have questions as well as others but you do you.", "N T A technically. But why would you put your dog through the stress of flying? (Even in the cabin since it\u2019s small enough for a carrier under a seat.) \n\nDo you know if the destination municipality/country has any quarantine laws? Will you need additional vaccinations for your dog?\n\nI would seriously think about this decision. The impact/stress of travel on your dog, leaving it with an unknown dog sitter, not being able to fully enjoy being with your family for your sisters wedding. Unless there\u2019s something more going on between you and your family, which you didn\u2019t indicate. But really, there must be a dog sitter/boarding facility where you live that would be a better solution.", "NTA. But why do you even need to bring it? And are you aware of any laws that would prohibit you from bringing a dog from an outside country/ re-entry in the first place?", "YTA - it's about your sister, not your dog. Hire a puppy sitter and leave it at home. Really rude to prioritize the animal over family togetherness to be honest. I would be offended", "I\u2019m really wondering if OP has a reason why the dog can\u2019t be left. Sometimes due to age, breed, temperament, etc., a dog can\u2019t be left with a sitter or in a kennel. In my case we\u2019d skip the wedding completely or we\u2019d divide and conquer (I have two who can\u2019t be boarded right now). I saw someone else asked that question, so I\u2019ll delay judgment until OP answers. I kind of lean that it isn\u2019t great and may be an AH move, but maybe it\u2019s the best they can do and better than missing it completely.", "They said in the post that they don't spend all the time together. Not every family is the same and expect everyone to be around eachother all the time just cuz.", "This should be the only question OP. Because either the dog doesn't go or this is a 3 week or so long vacation for the dog in quarantine. Possibly 3 more weeks when you get back.", "This is probably the best answer \u2026 pretty much all countries have quarantine requirements for pets\u2026 any it\u2019s usually months, not just days.\n\nI also curious about why they would bring the dog at all? Is it a service dog? Like actually and not just for emotional support? The only reason I could really get behind would be service dog, in which case many countries will have an exception to quarantine for actual registered service dogs, but there is a ton of paperwork to be done in advance.", "Maybe it\u2019s equivalent to the cost of boarding. Not every pet owner is comfortable with boarding for there a lot of stories of neglect.", "Probably the dog mom type that thinks her dog is equivalent to having a human infant", "So they don't have to stay at the same resort as mom ;)", "I\u2019m not arguing for or against OP because I don\u2019t have all the info, but there are valid reasons why this isn\u2019t always possible:\n\nA dog-aggressive dog may not be accepted at a boarding kennel, more of which are moving to a social/daycare model.\n\nAn intact dog won\u2019t be accepted at a boarding kennel past a certain age. (One of mine is ineligible to board for this reason; that will change when he\u2019s old enough to neuter.)\n\nDogs that are fearful and/or human-reactive are often a poor fit for a boarding kennel, for their own wellbeing and that of staff. (My other dog is fearful and would stress himself into oblivion in a kennel environment; he can\u2019t be boarded either.)\n\nSome breeds are restricted due to the kennel\u2019s insurance (unfortunate but still reality). Some breeds may be too much for a typical dog sitter to handle (I would be very careful about leaving a Fila Bras\u00edlio with anyone).\n\nSome dogs have health issues that make it difficult to board them or leave them with a sitter.\n\nIt REALLY sucks to look at your dog and realize, *I have nowhere to leave this dog if I have to leave town.* My fearful dog is actually a super car traveler and is good in a crate, so I could go somewhere WITH him and crate him at an Airbnb. That\u2019s what we do when we visit family who don\u2019t like dogs. We just limit or split the amount of time we leave them. Obviously that doesn\u2019t work for a destination wedding, so if I were in OP\u2019s shoes, my husband and I would either be deciding who went and who stayed with the dogs, or we\u2019d just both skip it altogether.", "They won't be able to do family stuff if there is any at the wedding resort - they can only get a guest pass for the other resort for one day.", "I'm wondering if it's the kind of thing where if the bride and groom get enough people to stay at the resort, their room gets comped. Maybe they need OP to stay there to hit the right number.\n\nBut, yeah, that's not OP's concern. If OP is paying, OP stays where OP wants.", "They said \n\n have been to a family wedding internationally before on a beach island and spent most of our time individually (with our SOs), spending any family time mostly on just the day of the wedding and the occasional dinner.\n\nThat was a prior wedding so depends of the activities planned for this wedding, which OP didnt elaborate upon.  Just because a prior wedding was that way, it doesnt mean this one will be the same", "Right? We literally had a local kennel burn down, you never know what people are afraid of.", "I wish she had elaborated a bit on her reasons for bringing her dog except for \u201cwe want to.\u201d Seems like unnecessary stress for everyone. But if there\u2019s a reason (like you outlined above) then I would say N A H. The family wants them all together, they need? their dog with them. Both potentially valid.", "They can stay at the same resort AS THE REST OF THE FAMILY.", "I agree then why did you say N-T-A. Sounds like choosing the dog over being a part of the wedding festivities makes them at least a tiny bit of an AH"]}
