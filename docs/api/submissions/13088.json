Is it a service dog? Like actually and not just for emotional support?

I should have been much clearer.\n\nI am assuming this destination wedding is on an island.", "Maybe it\u2019s equivalent to the cost of boarding.

(One of mine is ineligible to board for this reason; that will change when he\u2019s old enough to neuter.)\n\nDogs that are fearful and/or human-reactive are often a poor fit for a boarding kennel, for their own wellbeing and that of staff. (My other dog is fearful and would stress himself into oblivion in a kennel environment; he can\u2019t be boarded either.)\n\nSome breeds are restricted due to the kennel\u2019s insurance (unfortunate but still reality). Some breeds may be too much for a typical dog sitter to handle (I would be very careful about leaving a Fila Bras\u00edlio with anyone).\n\nSome dogs have health issues that make it difficult to board them or leave them with a sitter.\n\nIt REALLY sucks to look at your dog and realize, *I have nowhere to leave this dog if I have to leave town.* My fearful dog is actually a super car traveler and is good in a crate, so I could go somewhere WITH him and crate him at an Airbnb. That\u2019s what we do when we visit family who don\u2019t like dogs. We just limit or split the amount of time we leave them.

I highly suggest not doing that\u2026 it sounds like you are leaving the country so you will have to go to not just a normal vet, but a specially accredited vet to sign off on health documents.  Then those health documents have to be sent to a governmental agency that deals with animals/agriculture to sign off on those for just one part of the travel documents. Oh, and that health cert could be valid for 30 days, or for 72 hours (depending on the country you are going to and where you are coming from), so it\u2019s always nice to sweat out the mail sending you your official documents right before your flight.\n\nDepending on the location there could be permits needed, or a designated quarantine time period once you arrive, or if your going to Hawaii the absolute craziest rabies check that you have ever seen (Hawaii is rabies free and plans to stay that way)\n\nMany airlines will also force you to use a pet travel agency (since it is so damn complicated to ship animals internationally and if just anyone tried it they would fuck up and get their pet stuck in customs), and the lowest quote I\u2019ve seen is $1500 for a small trip, one way.  Even though your pet is 10lbs and could sit on your lap on a domestic flight, some countries, like the UK, have regulations that say your dog cannot ride in the cabin, they would be in a crate in the baggage hold no matter the size, And crate regulations/checking in your dog to the cargo hold is a whole other story \n\nIt\u2019s expensive, a massive headache, and absolutely no one understands the process before they start is and easily get overwhelmed by all the little things you have to do.

I know dogs are family and all, but we are talking about a literal animal over your relationship with your sister and family. \n\nA wedding is a big deal, and it sounds like they are spending a lot of money to have their guests be comfortable at their destination wedding resort.

I flew a dog this way one time and I believe it contributed a lot to his now 13 year long anxiety streak. If you fly with a pet buy them a spot in the cabin. And as someone else mentioned you\u2019ll have to make sure the country you\u2019re going to and the country you\u2019re going home to will allow animals to cross the border without quarantine, otherwise you may be leaving your dog alone for several weeks/months for quarantine.

Outside, she does her business much more quickly and then immediately tries to crawl back into her crate rather than go for a walk!As for the flight- I once flew in the middle seat for a 7 hour journey, and when I pulled her crate out at the end of the flight, the people next to me were actually shocked there was a dog there the whole time because they hadn\u2019t even realized.

Similarly, I have some go-to friends my pup can stay with because they LOVE having her, but even just getting her to them and picking her up is a bigger pain in the ass than just flying with her. Leaving her in a kennel would be really ruff (sorry) for her because she gets overwhelmed and stressed around a lot of other dogs, and does better one-on-one.\n\nNaturally there are also other more extreme concerns about the potential dangers of kennels or people you barely know taking care of your dog, especially when you\u2019re far away.\n\nI don\u2019t see anything wrong with nor weird about someone choosing to travel with their dog if they can do so easily.

Most places laws treat pets like property. If you have a dog reactive dog it\u2019s even more scary because not everyone takes that seriously and will put the dog in a dangerous situation, and most of the better boarding places won\u2019t even take a dog reactive dog or will charge crazy amounts because they can only watch that one dog instead of a few at the same time. \n\nThat comment is just an annoying thing people say because they are ignorant. Possibly jealous because dogs are easier? They just don\u2019t get that you can care about your pet and want to spend time with them because you enjoy their company. Just because I love my dog and don\u2019t trust strangers to care for her doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a replacement kid or equivalent to an infant. I don\u2019t want kids, I want the dog. I can leave the dog home alone for a few hours, it doesn\u2019t need constant care or attention. How can I be using it as a replacement or think its equivalent to something I don\u2019t want? lol I prefer the dog because it\u2019s not like an infant. Not because it\u2019s a replacement/equivalent anything. \n\nIts almost ironic because if pet sitting was as safe or as regulated as daycare or babysitting - most pet parents would be more comfortable using it. But it\u2019s not, so we end up having to travel with the pets. Then you get assholes thinking just because you want to travel with your pet you somehow think it\u2019s an infant. They have to turn everything into a competition and can\u2019t just let people live how they want to live. It\u2019s like when you mention being tired around a parent and they have to turn it into the tired olympics, give themselves the gold and push everyone else off the podium. lol\n\nAgree with the plane thing, a pet in cargo is just as scary and dangerous as boarding. But there may not be a plane involved, or if the resort caters to dogs there maybe dog friendly airlines that go to the area that don\u2019t put dogs in cargo areas.", "some pets also have anxiety.  My cats have developed severe anxiety after we were displaced when the building we lived in caught on fire.  One of my cats hide and had to be left in the building and it was almost 4 full days before we were allowed access to find him (he was alive and was physically ok) and while my other cat we were able to grab, sitting outside for hours surrounded by people and firefighters in his carrier was terrifying for him, on top of being carted around unfamiliar places for the next month until we found a new home. \n\nIts not always crazy pet people.

It can be done, but in my experience most owners do not understand proper import/export procedures, even traveling between states. I\u2019m a veterinarian who used to write health certificates for animals needing to travel, and I no longer do it because it\u2019s not worth the headache for how little clients pay, especially when they try to bully me into falsifying medical records because they don\u2019t think the rules apply to them.\n\nAustralia is not the only place with a long quarantine. Hawaii does as well, even if the animal currently lives in another state in the US. There are many countries with strict rules. At least part of it has to do with their Rabies\u2019 free status.

Traveling between countries of a different rabies status can be extremely time-consuming and expensive, plus it can take 6+ months of planning, vet visits, blood tests, etc.\n\nI think going through all of that effort is worth it when you\u2019re moving, but it seems like a hassle for a short trip like a destination wedding (although it can be possible, and nothing is stopping you if you\u2019re willing to follow the rules).", "It's a 10 lb dog.

As someone whose family has owned a travel agency for over 30yrs, there is normally an extensive process to bring an animal into a foreign country and that just proves point 1.

Your questions are very very valid.\n\nQuarantine times are usually a month each side, from what I remember (at least leaving the UK).\n\nFurther questions I have:\n\nIs the maltipoo in question fit and healthy? Up to date on major vaccinations? Vaccines for diseases prevalent in the country of travel? \n\nIs the dog short snouted (braccy something)? This can be a MAJOR issue for flights as these dogs struggle to breathe as is.\n\nOn the other side of it:\n\nIs the dog anxious? Difficult? Aggressive? Stranger aversive? Complicated care requirements?\n\nThese things can make it a valid reason wanting to bring the dog. \n\nSome dogs can do TERRIBLY in kennels. I\u2019m talking being so anxious they don\u2019t eat or drink, cry constantly and hurt themselves. They can chew themselves raw, pull their fur out and piss all over themselves.\n\nMy dog came back with an ear infection from the kennels (and we\u2019re still dealing with it 4 YEARS later, to the point I might need to rehome due to the medical expense).\n\nThen pet sitters - if the dog is not okay with unfamiliar people and there\u2019s no time to acclimatise them to the situation with CONSTANT visits and games with the new person\u2026 then it\u2019s really not in the dogs best interest to be left with a pet sitter.\n\nIf the dog is difficult or aggressive then it might not be safe for a pet sitter.\n\nIf they require complicated care, it could be difficult finding a pet sitter willing or able to help.\n\nConcluding: \n\nGetting a dog is a life decision. Sometimes shit doesn\u2019t work out and you sacrifice your personal freedom. My dog ended up anxious and broken (I love her but still) and I can\u2019t leave her alone for even 5 minutes without her screaming. She can\u2019t go in kennels because of her ears and also she would literally chew her legs til they\u2019re pink and hairless. I can\u2019t get a pet sitter because she screams even if someone other than me/my family is with her. She\u2019s also extremely unpredictable due to her ears being fucked. She will bite without warning. I would never leave her with someone who couldn\u2019t deal with this. She stays with my dad and my dad only.\n\nIF OPs dog is half as problematic as mine then I understand wanting to solve the problem and do both.\n\nIF there are options for the dog to stay home then I would definitely recommend that regardless as the dog will be stressed on a flight even being fit and healthy!!", "I was going to say this as well: I went to a destination wedding last year and the best part was hanging out with everyone at the resort!\n\nIt was a big group of family and friend, mostly couples, and I didn\u2019t know anyone other than my husband.

I love travelling, especially walking around a beautiful old town and seeing everything I can. Old architecture is a big passion of mine. I always hated the idea of spending a whole vacation sitting at a beach or lounging in a pool getting sunburned. What a waste of time!\n\nSo I was vehemently anti-resort my entire life\u2026 right until the second day of the trip. As I sat in the pool with my husband, with absolutely no inkling of the time of day, drinking my 5th mojito of the day, deciding which on-property restaurant to go to for dinner after our spa appointment, I had an epiphany\u2026 this is IT! \n\nAn all inclusive means you\u2019re not just on vacation, you\u2019re on a *brain vacation*. You get charged for almost nothing on the resort, so after a few days you forget money exists (other than for tipping). You find yourself in an all new realm of decision making: where I would normally look at the prices first at a restaurant, I just ordered what I wanted. Instead of ordering something \u201csafe\u201d that I knew I\u2019d like, I was being adventurous and trying new things. Instead of getting the cheapest beer on tap, I was ordering elaborate cocktail concoctions. Should I get a massage by the pool tomorrow or reserve a cabana down by the beach? Why not both! It\u2019s already paid for, so you never feel like you\u2019ve wasted money. And I was so much less critical of things because of that! Not the best cocktail? Oh well, order another one! No pressure!\n\nOf course we also went into town to walk around on some of the days, and ventured out to visit some of the local bars and restaurants. But I also didn\u2019t feel like I was missing out on the days that we chose to stayed on resort. \n\nAn all inclusive means that your wants will be truly catered to. I\u2019ve never experienced that type of self-indulgence before. I never even wanted to! I thought it was too selfish and gross and boujee. But I was pleasantly surprised to find out I was wrong! \n\nI\u2019ll always prefer traditional trips spent hiking and roaming around old villages. But I would also absolutely do an all-inclusive again if the opportunity arose. If possible, I think everyone should try it just once.", "I\u2019m so sorry, that\u2019s horrible and traumatizing.

You seriously can't go a few days/week (you didn't specify the time apart) without your dog?\n\nI love animals, and love my pets, but I just can't fathom why people feel the need to take them with them on flights and international trips. Seems to me it would be really stressful on the pet. I've seen little dogs boarded on planes, crammed under the seats, and it just looks like a cruel event to me. Most of the time they're scared to death.", "YTA", "I mean depends on the dog. My dog would be farrrrr more stressed being left behind than traveling. In fact he loves traveling. \n\nCar or plane doesn\u2019t faze him, the only stress is thinking he\u2019ll be left when I\u2019m packing. Once I grab the leash, it\u2019s all wags. \n\nHotels are fun for him, he loves the big beds. \nSleep in a tent? Sure! Car camp? Lights out. \n\nHis happy place is with me, and as long as he\u2019s included, he\u2019s game. \n\nIf he\u2019s left, even with someone he trusts and likes, he\u2019s stressed the entire time. That\u2019s terrible for his immune system and health. \n\nI\u2019ve boarded him once and never again. He got so sick and also got an eye injury \u2014  he had vet follow-ups for weeks and had to take so much medication. He felt terrible and was freaked out by it all and I felt guilty as hell. And this was a very nice reputable place. \n\nI found out from his vet even the nicest boarding places are a risk simply because of the number of dogs there. There\u2019s dog fights, illnesses, injuries, possibility of escape, and there\u2019s those stories of fires and animal abuse.   \n\nThat\u2019s way more stressful for both of us, and especially for him, than just simply going with me. \n\nIt would be selfish of me to travel without him or leave him even with family for more than a couple nights, because even with them, around day 3 he\u2019ll refuse to eat.", "If they have enough money to book their own resort, I think they can shell out some cash for a professional dog sitter.", "...", "This.
