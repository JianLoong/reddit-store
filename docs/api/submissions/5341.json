File a police report and leave ASAP, you are not safe there.", "OP might want to crosspost this on r/legaladvice to explore her options.", "What could she do to you while you are asleep if you can't even lock your door then? Police report then demand security deposit back ASAP and move. Tell landlord it is this or you file criminal charges against her daughter and violations of landlord tenant laws in your area against her.", "Exactly, I was just talking off the cuff but they have a whole thing going on here, I mean someone who enters your room without permission, vandalizing your property with a Butter Knife, I mean cmon, if that doesn\u2019t sound psychotic I don\u2019t know what does but again this is just an off the cuff remark I am not actually analyzing this crazy woman- again for the Redditor above- its just an off the cuff remark.", "There\u2019s a reason she\u2019s 45 and still living with mommy\u2026", "employing a favorite word I've seen used here in appropriate context a couple of times, I'ma call these \"butter-knife shenanigans\"\n\nAlso, OP is NTA and yikes ...", "NTA. You need to move out though. Charge them for a new computer. Save the video of her daughter stabbing it.", "NTA\n\nGet the hell out of there. They're destroying your property, and the way she reacted about the camera makes me think that they are doing something else in there they don't want you to know about, It's sketchy.", "NTA take the video of the property destruction to the police, file whatever reports you can and fine a new place to live. Asap.", "NTA....look for another place to live, you are living with a psycho...what lunatic 45 yo would do this?", "NTA but I'd move asap", "NTA but If I were you, I\u2019d be looking for a new place, not asking us what you already knew! This is a crazy situation, I wish a mf would stab my MacBook, what in the world\u2026", "NTA move out and bring the video of her stabbing your computer to the police", "You need to present a bill for the damages. Keep the camera, keep the locks, until you can find a better place. They have demonstrated they cannot be trusted. NTA", "Get out of there asap! Nta!", "NTA, move out asap", "NTA. Sounds like the daughter has some serious hate for Apple products... Good advice already given regarding getting the police involved.", "NTA and call the police and have the daughter charged.  Expect to be evicted, whatever that process is where you live, but you cannot put up with this.", "I suggest taking that vid to the police. File a report for destruction of property. Then look for a new place to live since neither roommate repect your privacy. Keep the lock on the door until you move.", "NTA but seriously move asap", "Just move out. Your actions are a short time solution. You do not want to live with someone who intentionally destroys your stuff while you aren't at home and another backing them up.\n\nJust no.", "NTA but this may be more of an r/legaladvice issue since I don't know if you can legally change the locks on the landlord or not. Small claims court for sure though. Good luck!", "U need to move house otherwise she will be stabbing you next. That's not a normal behaviour from the daughter", "Leave that place ASAP.  The daughter might end up stabbing you with the butter knife while you're asleep.", "NTA I agree find a new place report everything to the police and sue", "A knife, used in your personal space, to damage your belongings. What if it had been a sharp knife? While you were sleeping? GET OUT NOW!", "You need to find a new house share", "Seriously what the actual fuck", "Good point.  It could be fueled by jealousy!  Whatever the case, I agree with you....this girl needs to get the heck out of there before the middle-aged daughter tries to use the butter knife to stab at her.  Scary stuff!", "Right?  Something very \"off\" with the 45 yr old.....like, scary stuff!", "Maybe back it up on a friend\u2019s computer too just in case.", "OP has a right to safety in her room, and protection of her property. If a 45yo woman is going in there stabbing at a computer, defended by her mother, this is not a safe place. Who knows what else could be damaged. OP, when you\u2019re out report this to whatever service you came to learn about the room by. They\u2019ll blacklist those woman from hosting through their service again.", "I\u2019ve legitimately never ran into that problem before, I\u2019ve asked and received advice there \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "JFC I glazed over the ages before and thought the daughter was an unsupervised toddler. GET OUT OP! THAT WOMAN IS GOING TO MURDER YOU IN YOUR SLEEP!!"]}
