Please consider talking to a police officer and just asking them what they think about the behaviour/ages involved. The mother was not immediately apologetic and outraged on your behalf. This is telling. The daughter had done this more than once before you caught her. This is also telling. Flag it ASAP with someone in your world - a police officer, a therapist, a doctor or friend - ANYONE so that at least someone knows just in case.", "[removed]", "These people, especially the daughter, are unhinged.\n\nPlease go to the police and move out ASAP.", "and maybe online, just think what that'd do for her life.", "> This will prove that they broke your lease. Tell her that if she doesn't  return your security deposit,\n\nThat's not how that works. The house is in the name of the mother. There's no situation in which the mother, the landlord, is legally liable for the actions of her adult daughter. Depending on local laws, OP might have the right to terminate the lease without notice but this still wouldn't affect the security deposit. \n\nThe only person liable for the damages is the daughter here.", "Don't get rid of the camera until you are out either. Research tenant (or boarder) rights and laws in your area. Find out if they have a right to enter your room without notice. Find out if it is okay to have a lock, if they need a key to the room or just prior notice for you to let them in. Anything and all things, start researching. In some areas boarders have less rights than a tenant would leasing an apartment. Also review whatever lease or contract you have. I am worried about OP and hope they take this all very seriously.", "My brain parsed that as 4-5, it had to be a little kid, because the idea of a woman older than I am doing this is horrifying.", "OMG!! I never thought of that. That could actually be a possibility. If she is, that takes the 45 year old\u2019s strange actions to a whole other level of creepiness. Wow!", "Indeed, and her mother just doesn't want you to have documentation of the behavior", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

The daughter's behavior is strange.", "So agree! This is disturbing", "Yes - I'd be concerned about living with someone who invades my space and damages my things with a butter knife.  She's 45, FFS.  She can't be stable if this is how she acts.", "I disagree. Two perspectives :\n\n1. The daughter is a tenant.\nThe landlord is aware that OP has a breach in OP ' s home and is demanding that OP remove her locks and camera defenses against the daughter tenant.\nThis shows the landlord is allowing harm to the tenant and violation of her home. This is a crime and willful negligence. \n\n2. The daughter and the mother are  landlords.\nThe landlord is violating the sanctity of the home, causing damage to property and endangering the OP.\n\nBOTH are legally actionable. Sue them. They aren't just AH, they are criminals. They must be sued. Keep the camera, install a deadbolt, record any interactions with them, and do not vacate hastily. Do not shy away from court. Some people deserve a  financial punch in the gut. This is more than just getting a deposit back.\n\nPlus if youre 20, you can get experience on how the legal system is, and protect yourself for the rest of your life. You win either way.", "Oh my god", "Pleading insanity is not a defense. All it means is that in the *very* unlikely case that it succeeds, you get placed under medical supervision *indefinitely* until you are deemed competent. Which is basically a sentence without an end. It's almost never successful, and isn't a \"get out of jail free\" card.", "Yeah, this is incredibly bizarre but there\u2019s nowhere near enough info to call it psychosis. I\u2019d definitely be wary of someone who goes into peoples rooms stabbing computers for fun because that\u2019s fucking weird, but it\u2019s not psychotic in and of itself.", "What *possible* scenario are you imagining that pleading insanity would even remotely potentially come up?", "I mean, OP only recently put a new doorknob with a lock in it, to replace the\n\nold one.\n\n The creepy Norman Bates -wannabe daughter could have gone in the room at any time, before that.\n\nI wouldn't want to spend one more night in that house, especially since the\n\nlandlady and her daughter are now aware that OP is on to them.\n\nI'm hoping the woman doesn't escalate.", "Seriously. Seems like something a precocious child or angry teen might do, not a 45 year old!"]}
