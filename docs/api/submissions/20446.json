Both my mom and my dad has had several relationships since then and I liked all of those. My mom got together with his now boyfriend and around that time my dad got together with his now wife (40f), who I'll call B.\n\nB was a very nice and sweet woman when I first met her. She already had a son (11m) when he met my dad. So things went great for a while. \n\nBut then B got pregnant in the beginning of 2021, which gave another reason for her and my dad to get married. I was happy for them and was very excited to have another brother. However, as time went on B's pregnancy did too and she became a pregnant at risk so she had to stop working a lot earlier than usual. And that's when it all started going downhills. \n\nShe became insufferable. She started insulting everyone. She even managed to yell at my then-boyfriend right after he asked me to become his girlfriend with a reason still unknown. She started disrespecting everyone so obviously me too. But I tried my best to ignore it all. That's what my dad advised us to do too, blaming her attitude and behavior on the pregnancy and I said fine. When she finally gave birth to my half-brother (1.5m) we thought it was over. Oh boy were we wrong... \n\nMy half brother was barely 3 months old when my dad told me B was pregnant again. I, again, underestimated B by thinking that it couldn't get any worse because it did. It so did. Because she not only became a pregnant at risk again, a loud, non-stop crying baby was by her side now too. \n\nAnd this time, she wasn't rude to everyone, only me. And yes, I admit I wasn't and am not the perfect step-step-daughter but I was dealing with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression and anorexia and she knew it all. And she not only didn't care about all this, she even called out how lazy I was, how useless I was, and always said I was a nightmare and wished I didn't exist. Wished I \u20acnd\u20acd myself already. \n\nThe worst thing about these insults wasn't the insults themselves but that my dad never said anything. One time she was so mad I ate the last yogurt in the fridge (that's all I ate that day because of her following sentence) she threatened me with $uff0c@t!ng me that night with a pillow. By the time she went into labour I didn't want to look in her eyes or say one word to her. \n\nIt's been 6 months and B stayed the same narcissistic asshole. She apologized to my dad for her behavior during and post pregnancy but never said a word to me. She asked my dad to talk to me about forgiving her. When I told my dad I intend on staying silent he got really mad at me and refuses to accept my point and wants to force me to apologize to her.\n\nNow I'm the \"evil step-daughter who wants her step-mother gone\" in the family. Honestly the statement is true, I want her gone.\n\nSo Dear Redditors, please help me decide because I seriously don't know what to think at this point. Am I really the asshole in the story?", "created_utc": 1687567495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14heuzz/aita_for_refusing_to_repair_my_relationship_with/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hear me out. \n\nYou are a child (not a dig\u2014a factual statement), and working through mental health issues. Your stepmother\u2019s treatment of you is not only monstrous, but unfair; you have every right to act your age. Teenagers are not supposed to be \u201cperfect stepchildren\u201d. No one has it all figured out at your age. You are navigating an emotionally, mentally, and physically volatile phase of life. And you deserve to have people who support you and love you through this difficult phase. \n\nAs for your stepmom, pregnancy hormones can make someone almost unrecognizable. Her behavior strongly suggests perinatal mood disorders, especially if it seemed out of character for her. The fact that she got pregnant again less than 3 months later means that she was still probably not sleeping through the night, feeling touched out and overstimulated by a screamy infant, and her hormones were FAR from returning to normal, so she still likely does not feel anything like herself. Then the hormonal and physical whiplash of a new pregnancy compounds the hell out of everything. \n\nShe probably has no idea how to make amends with you (if that\u2019s what she really does want to do), which is why she\u2019s talking to your dad instead of you about it. \n\nNone of this is to belittle how poorly you\u2019ve been treated. But I hope it helps you understand the situation a little more clearly. It\u2019s impossible to understand how much a pregnancy can mess with a person\u2019s head until it happens to you (if that\u2019s what you want someday). I was suicidal in my first pregnancy, which was highly out of the norm for me, especially since I struggled with infertility for many years before getting pregnant and desperately wanted to BE pregnant. I didn\u2019t recognize myself, and it didn\u2019t get much better by 3 months postpartum (although I wasn\u2019t suicidal by that point; I was just having terrifying and graphic intrusive thoughts). \n\nPrioritize your safety above all else. But please know that it is likely your stepmom actually is not this monster under normal (hormonal) circumstances. Best of luck to you.", "ESH.Ever hear of hormones?  Hope to God you don't experience Post partum depression along with raging hormones.  Her getting pregnant the 2nd time was probably quite the shock for her as well.  Now I have no idea how one sided your description is, but high risk with all the other indicators mentioned....it has to be the hardest time of her life.  Should she apologize to you?  I dunno, what did you say to her?  I suggest family therapy or you may be the AH, in everyone else's view.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
