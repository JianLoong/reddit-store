I'm 37 years old now, he hasn't called my brother that since we were teens but it still hurts.", "Yta", "OP, YTA\u2026 it\u2019s very easy to say suck it up and live with it when you aren\u2019t the one being called a hag. She is your sister.  You should be sticking up for her.  If someone at school bullied her, would you have stood by and told her that she should suck it up and live with it?  I sincerely hope not.  This is different only in the fact that your uncle is a grown ass man and should know better!  \n\nAlso, you make the argument that he has always been this way, will always be this way, won\u2019t change so we all have to accept the way he is.  This is the same argument that gets made for accepting family members that use the N word or any other derogatory word out there.  It\u2019s a specious argument whose time has long since passed.  If things never changed, you wouldn\u2019t have a vote or own property, your husband would have the right to beat you with a stick as long as it was smaller than his thumb, marital rape wouldn\u2019t be a crime, domestic violence wouldn\u2019t be a crime, if your husband got tired of you, he could commit you to an asylum against your will and African Americans wouldn\u2019t even be considered a whole person, let alone a free one.  \n\nJust sayin\u2019", "Just in case you don\u2019t know what hag means an ugly, slatternly, or evil-looking old woman. As children they  don\u2019t know better so they go along with the jokes but as adults we know better and should do better so yea  YTA", "YTA. You seem to enjoy bullying your sister.", "It takes zero effort for your uncle to either come up with a nice nickname or just not call her any nickname. \n\nYou should ask yourself why you are so hell bent on your uncle being allowed to call your sister something she doesn't like. \n\nImagine that every time your uncle greeted you he gave you a pat in the back, but he always put too much force into it so that it hurts. \n\nI'm guessing after a certain point you would rather your uncle didn't pat you at all. \n\nHow would you feel if, after asking your uncle to either ease up or stop it all together, your siblings told you to just deal with the pain and you might get used to it eventually? Even though your uncle could EASILY just not hit you as hard or not pat you at all, he still put too much force every time and suddenly you are the bad guy for wanting it to stop.", "**YTA**", "Your uncle sounds like a weird dude. Not for the initial nickname, but once she threw a tantrum and made it clear she didn\u2019t enjoy it, it\u2019s just bullying from there on.\n\nIt\u2019s weird. I felt bad for weeks once when I tried to mock my neice lovingly about her terrible British accent (lol) and she got SUPER mad and insulted. I reminded myself that kids can be sensitive and I\u2019m the adult and I made sure to watch how I interacted with her from then on.  (Now she\u2019s 19 and can give it as well as she can take it lol, but point is your uncle not shifting is kinda weird)", "ESH. \n\nYou're not responsible for your uncles choice of nickname, but you're kind of the AH for dismissing your sisters feelings", "YTA. Sounds like you come from a family of assholes if not one person will defend your sister from unwanted \u201cteasing\u201d.   You are obviously old enough to know that \u201cthe hag\u201d and \u201cblondie\u201d are not comparable nicknames, so acting like it\u2019s relevant that others aren\u2019t bothered by their nickname is disingenuous", "To be fair he started calling her the hag because she's like her mom and those 2 have an ongoing joke about her being the hag. It doesn't sound like he was trying to offend her.", "NTA. If she really wanted a new nickname she could\u2019ve asked for one politely. Like \u201cAye, can my nickname get some sort of promotion?\u201d or \u201cSince I got a \u2018glow up\u2019, can I get a name to match?\u201d. But, honestly it\u2019s not that big of a deal. My grandpa calls me, Haystack, because I hardly do my hair.", "ESH.", "Tell her to stop acting like the names she has been given. Lol\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA. He did change her nickname to grouch and if she is still making a fuss, the nickname fits. Instead if throwing a tantrum she could just come up with a better one for herself or just not accept gifts from him moving forward.", "ESH, returning a present because of a childhood nickname is a bit childish. But c\u2019mon she\u2019s asked time and time again to cut it out and y\u2019all aren\u2019t getting the message. Also for context, how old is your sister?", "YTA! Do you hate your sister? Why are you supporting this bullying? Why aren't you standing up for her? If anyone insulted my sister I'd hand their ass to them on a platter and make them eat it.\n\nYou're only fine with the names because you didn't get a shitty one. And even if you truly would be \"fine\" if he called you sonething stupid like \"little miss poopyface\" you should support your sister if only because it hurts her feelings.", "She used to tell him he could be Santa\u2019s twin because he\u2019s old and fat and when he took us to the pier she pointed out a seal and said it looked like him. They used to tease each other all the time", "I have a hunch there are many other screwy dynamics in this family and if OP eventually grows up and matures enough to start seeing it clearly she will have a lot of awkward realizations.", "Or OP's sister could just start calling her \"the bitch\" from now on. There is always that.", "I assume \u201cThe big one\u201d and \u201cthe little one\u201d are about birth order, not physical size. At least, that\u2019s what we call the oldest and youngest kids in my family.", "13", "Big one is the oldest, blondie\u2019s hair is kinda reddish, the boy is actually a boy, the little one is the middle but she\u2019s tiny, then there\u2019s my sister whose nickname shall not be spoken (or written). With the big one, the boy, and little one he couldn\u2019t get their names right when they were little so he gave them those names and it stuck. Then he had to include blondie and she who shall not be named.", "I don\u2019t know. If the uncle gets to call OP\u2019s sister a hag, why shouldn\u2019t she get to call OP a bitch? \n\nBoth are nasty things to call someone with sexist connotations.", "Haystack is a lot nicer than the hag.", "She's asked them many times to stop and they're not listening, no more playing nice it seems.  (Good for her)", "Well one was a child and the other was/is an adult. So. You (and your uncle) are definitely TAs. Your uncle is a bully. I mean who name calls *kids* like that? An AH that\u2019s who.\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: she\u2019s only a 13??? Yeah. You guys suck.", "Keyword there is \u201cused to.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want to play the game anymore.", "Info: \nWhen is this mysterious \"used to\"?\nLast week? Last month? Last year? \nTake a second- when was the last time your sister participated in this ribbing?\nWhen was the last time she started it?", "So as a child she engaged in mean spirited teasing that she had been taught was \u2018acceptable\u2019. As a now older and more empathetic child she has learned that this kind of behavior is hurtful not only to herself but others and has asked for it to stop.\n\nHere is a lesson you should have already been taught. \u2018If the person in the gallows isn\u2019t laughing, it\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s part of the execution.\u2019\n\nShe isn\u2019t laughing. She\u2019s asked for it to stop. It\u2019s no longer teasing it\u2019s an adult bullying and her parents and siblings laughing while he does it.", "Imagine thinking because someone did something when they are young that it is the same as an actual adult acting that way", "Yeah likely because she was socialized to see that as normal. Then she got older and realized how mean and hurtful these things are and stopped. I used to say things I never would say these days, because I grew up and matured and learned that there are things you shouldn\u2019t say. It\u2019s a shame your uncle never did that.", "It\u2019s only teasing when the receiver accepts it as such. Otherwise it\u2019s mean and cruel.", "I'm guessing she grew out of it and he didn't. She realized things like that hurt others and he and you just think its funny.", "Yeah I remember being a literal child and when people in my family would make cruel jokes at my expense I would play along because I wasn\u2019t comprehending how disrespectful these \u201charmless\u201d jokes were. How about you and your uncle respect your sisters wants and find a nicer f*cking nickname for her", "They aren\u2019t though, \u201cthe hag\u201d is the youngest according to the post. So it likely *is* about size which is extra gross on top of a whopping serving of already awful.", "And how long has he been calling her a hag ? I assume awhile since you can't even remember her original nickname.", "Yea, this child should absolutely suck it up that her uncle is bullying her while the family laughs along/s/", "Wow\u2026 I thought she was going to be older. Y\u2019all are sick for calling a middle schooler \u2018a hag\u2019. How cruel to a girl going through puberty", "She\u2019s just a child????? 100% YTA.", "Ok so in the 13 years she's been alive, your uncle who never changes nicknames has changed hers 3 times, 2 of them being rude ones? Also she's 13, just a kid so she was fine before, but it sounds like she's learned what a hag actually means.", "ESH. While I agree with others you shouldn't have told her to get over herself and accept it, if she's 13 she should be old enough to simply ask for a new nickname instead of throwing a tantrum. But on the topic of age, your uncle should be old enough to think that maybe a nickname like hag wouldn't work as your sister got older, regardless if she looks like your mother.", "Your uncle is an asshole and you are too. YTA.", "This comment proves YTA how condescending. Show your sister some damn respect and drop the stupid nickname shit", "Well, your sister\u2019s nickname for you sounds like it is a good fit, so it may stick. Guess you\u2019ll just have to get over yourself and accept it.", "You are petty AF.", "I come from a culture where people get nicknames and they don\u2019t get to pick them. Clearly no one else on Reddit does. I\u2019d say your NTA she can get over herself.", "True, but it\u2019s still taking a jab at me. Another nickname I have is Lizardbreath. This one I would cry when I was younger, now it\u2019s like *\u201dwhatever\u201d*", "She apparently asked and was renamed \"grouch\"...that's when she had the tantrum.", "Her sister is 13. You do not call a 13 a hag. Nicknames should not be mean or make the person uncomfortable", "I come from a culture were we move far away from our family members who refuse to treat us with love and kindness and our lives are better for it.", "So since you're bullied by your family, its okay if this child is too? Wtf.", "It would not be unheard of where I\u2019m from to call a 13 year old a hag as a nickname, usually they are clearly not a hag. That would be the joke. \nMy point is, maybe it\u2019s a normal thing where op lives.", "I said she could ask for a different nickname. I guess people don\u2019t read.", "It doesn't matter a nice human does not continue to call someone something that makes you feel bad or uncomfortable."]}
