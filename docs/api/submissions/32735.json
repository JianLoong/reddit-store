I texted her and told her that I would not be able to make it and I would give her the gift when I saw her at school.  \nShe didn't respond to my text and I was removed from the party group chats as well as any group chats that I was in with her. I have two friend groups and the one with her has completely cut me off. My second friend group heard that she was talking about me behind my back at the party and calling me fake and saying that I needed to move on and \"be there for the people who were actually still alive\".  \nI feel like not going to her party was ok but I am also in a state of mourning so I might be in the wrong.

Just when you need support for the worst event of your life, your group has pulled away. \n\nIt's important for you to find supportive people in your life, but those friends may take a while before they can be there for you. Many teenagers don't know how to deal with death and thinking about losing people close to them can be too uncomfortable for them to think about.\n\nMy mom died when I was 16. Friends at school (long before the internet) pulled away. They didn't know how to react or what to say. I got the feeling that they wanted to distance themselves from the idea that a parent, any parent, even their own, could die. \n\nI talked some to my favorite teachers who were very supportive. And I had a small group of friends who continued to be there for me and eat lunch with me and talk about normal things. Find people who have the maturity to be supportive. Let the others go, as painful as that might feel. They are not ready to be friends on that level. \n\nYou sound like you've got a level head on your shoulders. Keep putting one foot in front of the other. Pour yourself into your studies so that you have more opportunities for college. Find a counselor or therapist if you can.", "Holy hell. You are absolutely NTA. Anyone who cares about you would understand that you are hurting and need time to mourn. This girl is not your friend. The trash is taking itself out. Also, I'm so sorry for your loss.", "Oh darling girl NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d however is a major AH. Until your world is sent upside down they will never know the pain you\u2019re in. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this and it sucks so hard. Allow yourself to feel the pain and it gets less sharp eventually. I think cutting that set of friends out may help. Stick with those that allow you to feel your feelings and grieve the way you need too", "She cut you off from a group chat. Girl, she's doing you a favor. She's nothing more than a self centered bitch right now who feels she's entitled to your time when you needed it most for yourself! \n\nYour grief for your father is not going to go away. It will get better with time, but it is not going to ever fully go away. It represents not just the loss of someone you deeply loved and loved you, but a major disruption in your life entirely.", "NTA. First of all, no one is obligated to go to parties ever, unless it's your own child or something. Your \"friend\" shouldn't be holding a grudge because you weren't 'there for her'. Clearly she isn't there for you, either. She sounds like an entitled brat who doesn't understand grief.", "Most 16 yr olds do not go through what you hare dealing with.\n\nYou lost your only parent.  You are dealing with grief, it hurt, it is awful.  I am very sorry for your loss.\n\nThe friends who cut you off are not your friends.  They lack in empathy.  Friends will understand that you are dealing with a major emotional episode in a person's life.  Jerks will think their parties are more important.\n\nIt is horrible that you are losing so called friends at the same time you are dealing with you very personal grief.\n\nYou did not, and should not have gone to the birthday party.  It was the day of the funeral, and I am sure your emotions were raw.\n\nNTA.  Please reconsider if these friends will support you though tough times.\n\n.", "NTA  \nI am so sorry. I can only imagine how devastating this is and it infuriates that some narcissistic mean girl is adding to your pain.  What this girl is saying about you is heartless.  There is nothing to feel guilty about, no one in their right mind would expect you to come to that party. \n\nYou have learned far too young that life is short. Do not waste any time with this horrible girl and her cowardly friends who have stopped talking to you.", "If anyone even think you are AH over this then you need to cut that person off as your friend for the incredible lack of empathy over the tragedy you are enduring right now.  You are ABSOLUTELY NOT WRONG in what you are going through right now because it really hurt.\n\nI am very sorry to read about your loss of your father.  All I can say is time will eventually dull the pain and you will remember more the good times you have had with your dad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your friend should understand that you are going through a lot and it's not fair for her to expect you to put on a happy face and attend her damn sweet 16 party the same day as your father's funeral. She needs to have some empathy, but I wouldn't hold my breath for that one. Focus on yourself and those who truly care about you during this tough time.", "NTA, your friend Katelyn sounds like a real piece of work. Losing a loved one is not something that can be easily moved on from and it's understandable that you would need to take time for yourself. Your other friends should have been more understanding instead of talking behind your back. Focus on those who truly support you during this difficult time.", "NTA. You bought her a gift during this time. That indicates you were thinking of her even during a traumatic time. She\u2019s a horrendous person.", "In my opinion, the trash takes itself out, nta, you are better off without her and others who support her.", "Big hug from this stranger", "NTA and cut that cancerous tumor of a friend out of your life, and everyone who feels as she does.  They\u2019re mutts.", "Anybody expecting you to attend a party the day of your father\u2019s funeral is extremely immature, unkind and not worthy of being a friend. Just focus on taking care of your mental health right now and let people who care about you support you. It sounds like this girl was envious of the huge amount of sympathy and attention you were getting and could not handle it -extreme immaturity and narcissism. That is all about her. Ignore all of that as much as you can and do not engage with her. Childish dramas are invented by young people who do not know what real life loss and grief are. You may find yourself emotionally more mature compared to many of your friends going forward because of what you have endured so young. Can you seek out someone close to your age who has lost a parent young. Those are the only kids who will understand you and your experience. Give yourself at least a few months, not days, before you expect yourself to be fully functional and engaged in all your usual activities. Is there a counselor you can see regularly as you go through this grief?"]}
