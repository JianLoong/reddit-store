This is one of the reasons I don\u2019t care for birthdays. People get it in their head that it\u2019s a free pass to do anything they want. After all, it\u2019s their birthday. Who cares who they screw over or how they make someone feel? A birthday is a free pass right? When you begin a relationship with someone, you join your lives, especially in the important moments, birthdays getting to be one of those important moments. When she changed plans on you without first discussing it, she was disregarding you and your feelings. To do it again showed a complete lack of respect for you as her companion, making it seem as though you must bend to her will and desires on a whim simply because it\u2019s her birthday. \n\nYou didn\u2019t blow up at her. You didn\u2019t try to make her feel bad. She asked a question and you responded honestly. Definitely NTA", "NTA, but were you invited to the party with her friends? If not, why not?", "NTA\n\nshe has ruined her own birthday and upset you in to the bargain. You even took the day off for this you had every right to be annoyed and she knows this. She knows she is in the wrong for changing plans twice.\n\nTBH I would have told her to shove it and she can have her Birthday alone. And gone off for the day by my self.\n\nShe is ungrateful and entitled, she messed you around and then sounds like once she heard the truth from you sulked for the day.", "I'd say NTA\n\nIt was her birthday but she changed the plan twice without consulting you and asked you what you thought.  \nI don't know how you worded it to her, but telling the truth doesn't make you an A.", "NTA, but your GF is a big one.\n\nYou planned a month ahead your plans, reserved a place to have dinner and even took the day off from work to spend the whole day together, yet, she changed the plans on the last minute to be with her friends, become just half a day together and not even going shopping to just be at home.\n\nShe ask you if you were annoyed, you expressed your feeling and she gets mad? Even saying that she does \"even get to plan what she is doing on her birthday\"?\n\nOP, your GF is toxic, or at least this behaviour it is, as she not only didnt care about your feelings, what you planned, but was also more concerned about hanging out with her friends that being with you, pretending to being the victim when she didnt get things her way and blame you.", "NTA - You communicated how you were feeling after being asked. You also didnt ruin anything, she was not considerate of the plans you had made.", "NTA she could plan her birthday however she wants. If she wanted to have a girls day and celebrate her birthday with you on some other it would be fine. However, constantly treating you like an afterthought is not.", "NTA \n\nthe plan was made by both of you and than changed.\n\nof course you feel that way i would to, but the only way to change how things are done is to address the issue.", "NTA. She sounds kind of wishy-washy", "NTA- If she didn't want to know she shouldn't have asked, which is what she should've done because it's obvious she doesn't care how you feel. If she cared she would have told her friends that she had already made plans and arranged it on a different day or slightly later/early so that she still had time with you.", "NTA. Dump her and find someone that wants to spend time with you enough to keep the plans you made together.", "NTA, and you\u2019re correct that she showed you neither you nor your relationship is a priority for her. \n\nShe asked you to take the day off, you did. She asked you to change the plan bc other people she likes/respects more than you asked her to change it (she could have pushed back and said she already had plans, but she wanted to be with the girlfriends more than you), you did. Then she ask you to change the plan AGAIN, relegating you to basically a YouTube viewer watching her out on makeup, and then she gets mad at YOU for calling out her shit behavior?? \n\nNah, man, let the girls have her.", "NTA, just because it's her birthday doesn't mean she can mess people around like that. Why didn't she tell her girlfriends that she couldn't do the Tuesday when they wanted to change it? That's what a decent person would do considering you'd booked the day off", "NTA I\u2019d be annoyed she wasted my day off", "NTA. But her obvious prioritising of her friends over you is a giant red flag. You rightfully felt dispensable and an afterthought, and I don't blame you. Imagine if you'd changed plans with your girl in order to meet your mates, then changed them again and cancelled with your girl. I doubt she'd be impressed. \n\nIn your shoes, I would be putting in as little effort into this relationship as possible, and see if she notices. It sounds to me like she's already got one eye on the exit door.\n\nGood luck,OP", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
