When you begin a relationship with someone, you join your lives, especially in the important moments, birthdays getting to be one of those important moments. When she changed plans on you without first discussing it, she was disregarding you and your feelings.

Even saying that she does \"even get to plan what she is doing on her birthday\"?\n\nOP, your GF is toxic, or at least this behaviour it is, as she not only didnt care about your feelings, what you planned, but was also more concerned about hanging out with her friends that being with you, pretending to being the victim when she didnt get things her way and blame you.", "NTA - You communicated how you were feeling after being asked.

That's what a decent person would do considering you'd booked the day off", "NTA I\u2019d be annoyed she wasted my day off", "NTA. But her obvious prioritising of her friends over you is a giant red flag. You rightfully felt dispensable and an afterthought, and I don't blame you.

Their party was originally on the Friday. I was not informed on the reason for the change", "That\u2019s not including the \u00a3200 I\u2019d already spent on her for her birthday in physical presents. That was just ignored at this moment", "Seeing that more and more with each comment. It\u2019s", "These are questions I have \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26", "Agreed with work and other day-to-day activities having a social life is difficult. I work in hospitality/service and she works in an office so most of the time when she\u2019s at work I\u2019m not and vice-versa. This was one day we\u2019d both booked of and we would spend some quality time together. Just didn\u2019t end up panning out the way either of us expected", "Fair point, I initially was going to plan her day. Was going to take her to the spa. However, she told me that within her household/family the person who\u2019s birthday it is decides what they\u2019re doing. \n\nThis came as a surprise to me as my birthday was before hers and she was asking what we were doing. I\u2019m used to someone else planning for me. So she explained how it worked for me and I planned my day. So this carried over to her birthday aswell.", "I\u2019d rather not die thank you \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26", "Bro dump her ass yesterday, holy fuck that.", "I agree with that. If she behaves like this now, it\u2019s likely she normally does", "If all of a persons past relationships with multiple different partners have been bad,  it may be them that is the problem. \n\n\n\nIn a relationship, there is no luck. There is intent, there are choices, and there are  actions and consequences.  But there is no luck involved. \n\n\nNTA.  \n\n\n\nBut i will say if a person goes through life and everyone they meet is an asshole they should consider the fact they may, in fact, be the one who is an asshole. You are not the asshole in this situation,  but your girlfriend is TA. The question is, was she in those other relationships, too?", "Well thats just like your opinion man... \n\nBut in all seriousness, you shouldn't be someone's priority. It's a partnership - you're both in it together. One person isn't more important than the other. That's such an alpha perspective - I should be priority number one for my woman. Like Andrew Tate is running the comments section. It reads like a neck beard support circle up in here\n\nOr OP could  just stop being a little boy, buck-up and learn how to deal with disappointment and the outside world. \n\nIt's so childish to whine like this and dump your shit on her right before she's to go out and be at a party for her. \n\nWhat's she's going to do? Tell her friends she's not going to the birthday party they want to throw her because she has to cuddle her BF and make him feel better? Doesn't sound like she planned this party - and OP didn't even have the cojones to actually plan a day with her. Just, \"ya I'll take you shopping and you choose a restaurant I'll make a res\" - if the day was so important you'd think OP could man up and plan something fun. \n\nGo shopping is like default Saturday morning - real special OP. \n\nOP isn't invited because the girls are getting together to show his GF a good time. OP sounds like a stick in the mud and the comments section here sounds like y'all are too. \n\nHe's got the day off now, hit the town - hard day of day drinking. Have a good time. Life is too good to whine about a party. It's a giant nothing burger. \n\nBut I'm getting downvoted to oblivion - so clearly I'm the minority. But hey, fuck-it - it's how I feel", "But for your birthday you planned your day so then it would make sense for her birthday that she planned her day right?", "\"massive L\"?", "Thank you, I guess for the most part I may be making excuses to justify her actions. Sometimes it is difficult when you love someone to see into these things", ">you shouldn't be someone's priority \n\nThere's literally no point being in a relationship if neither of you prioritise the other, there is no functional difference between that and acquaintances", "Yeah, you're getting downvoted to oblivion because you're being an ass. Comparing people saying that people in relationships should prioritize one another to Andrew Tate is so disingenuous and off the mark that all it does is paint you as a bigger AH. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with two people in a relationship prioritizing the other over friends. There is something wrong with jerking your partner around about plans that had been set a month prior and prioritizing your friends instead. A relationship is a partnership, and right now OP's GF is not treating OP like a partner at all. OP's GF easily could have -and should have-  reinforced that the party needed to be Friday because that Tuesday was already spoken for (which it was). \n\nAlso shopping can be a nice day out, especially if they don't go window-shopping. It means more than just going to the grocery store to pick up food. I guess it just reflects how limited your imagination is if you think shopping automatically equates to default Saturday morning. \n\nAs it is, OP's GF twice changed plans on OP without considering OP beforehand, despite their already made plans. That's an AH move. Her friends decided to change the party date on their own, and the GF didn't fight them on it because she'd rather disappoint her partner than her friends. That's an AH move.", "Yes. Which she did. By point about the cancellation isn\u2019t a frustration that she changed the plans. It was the reasoning why. I made a point of saying if the shoe was on the other foot, she would also probably feel let down", "Massive loss. Hope this helps", "Tread carefully friend. I spent too long in this kind of relationship. I've spent a little over a year being single and rebuild - my confidence was murdered and I felt so left out so often. Thinking \"why can't I have a normal gf\" etc. \n\nHopefully this isn't normal behavior for her and she can grow from it.", "I hope so, I take responsibility for my actions as-well, maybe in hindsight biting my tongue and getting on with the day would have been easier for both parties. But being a male who struggles with mental health issues. I know that\u2019s a slippery slope"]}
