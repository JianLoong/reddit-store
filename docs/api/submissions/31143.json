When you begin a relationship with someone, you join your lives, especially in the important moments, birthdays getting to be one of those important moments. When she changed plans on you without first discussing it, she was disregarding you and your feelings.

Even saying that she does \"even get to plan what she is doing on her birthday\"?\n\nOP, your GF is toxic, or at least this behaviour it is, as she not only didnt care about your feelings, what you planned, but was also more concerned about hanging out with her friends that being with you, pretending to being the victim when she didnt get things her way and blame you.", "NTA - You communicated how you were feeling after being asked.

That's what a decent person would do considering you'd booked the day off", "NTA I\u2019d be annoyed she wasted my day off", "NTA. But her obvious prioritising of her friends over you is a giant red flag. You rightfully felt dispensable and an afterthought, and I don't blame you.

However, she told me that within her household/family the person who\u2019s birthday it is decides what they\u2019re doing. \n\nThis came as a surprise to me as my birthday was before hers and she was asking what we were doing. I\u2019m used to someone else planning for me. So she explained how it worked for me and I planned my day.

Tell her friends she's not going to the birthday party they want to throw her because she has to cuddle her BF and make him feel better? Doesn't sound like she planned this party - and OP didn't even have the cojones to actually plan a day with her. Just, \"ya I'll take you shopping and you choose a restaurant I'll make a res\" - if the day was so important you'd think OP could man up and plan something fun. \n\nGo shopping is like default Saturday morning - real special OP. \n\nOP isn't invited because the girls are getting together to show his GF a good time. OP sounds like a stick in the mud and the comments section here sounds like y'all are too. \n\nHe's got the day off now, hit the town - hard day of day drinking. Have a good time.

There is something wrong with jerking your partner around about plans that had been set a month prior and prioritizing your friends instead. A relationship is a partnership, and right now OP's GF is not treating OP like a partner at all. OP's GF easily could have -and should have-  reinforced that the party needed to be Friday because that Tuesday was already spoken for (which it was). \n\nAlso shopping can be a nice day out, especially if they don't go window-shopping. It means more than just going to the grocery store to pick up food. I guess it just reflects how limited your imagination is if you think shopping automatically equates to default Saturday morning. \n\nAs it is, OP's GF twice changed plans on OP without considering OP beforehand, despite their already made plans.

It makes her acting incredibly selfish. You shuffled your schedule and plans twice to accommodate her and on the third time she asked you a question. What right does she have to get mad at your feelings. If she is upset it is because she is only thinking about herself birthday or not. \n\nAsk yourself this question what would her reaction have been if you did that to her? \n\nSetting boundaries is hard for some of us, but stand up for yourself.
