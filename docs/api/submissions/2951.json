Don\u2019t ask her to walk. She will be able to twist it around and tell your father how you expect her to walk while pregnant. It\u2019s just not a good look and going to hurt you more than help you.\n\nSo overall, your stepmom is atrocious. I think you should just bite the bullet and get your dad to teach you to drive. She will get angry, but she is going to get angry anyway. Just tell your dad that you know it will make it harder at first but it\u2019s better long term for both him and you and your stepmom. She just doesn\u2019t know it. I guess your father enjoys the chance to get away and be with you. But he would be better of getting divorced.", "NTA. She\u2019s being vindictive likely from jealousy. She cannot say you aren\u2019t allowed to get your license and then also go on about your father driving you. What does your father say about all of this? Does he actually ever step up to her and advocate for you, or does he let her treat you how she wants? \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re needing to deal with a step mom like her. I imagine it\u2019d be quite isolating for you. I think if you can start saving money for a place to live, you should. It\u2019ll be far better for your mental health if you can find a place that you can afford. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t tell her that she needs to walk as it\u2019d fuel the fire. Id be having a conversation with your dad though. She is being abusive and that\u2019s not okay. Good luck OP", "NTA.  She's being shitty for the purpose being shitty.  There's no universe in which she's going to actually agree to walk home, she's comfortable with there being a double standard here.\n\nI would keep in mind that telling her this isn't actually going to get her to stop what she's doing--she's going to keep right ahead with it.  It will likely just piss her off further.  That doesn't mean you'd be wrong to do it, I'd just think carefully about what you're actually trying to accomplish and whether your plan of attack has any real chance of accomplishing it.\n\nMost of all, it's time to sit down with your Dad and have a frank conversation about how your stepmom is treating you--this behavior is abusive, and she's in a position of power over you.\n\nYou're 18 now, so I'd also give some thought to whether it's time to be saving up to get your own place, because being under the same roof as your Stepmom is not sustainable in the long term.\n\nYour Dad isn't the only licensed driver out there who could teach you to drive, so I encourage you to find someone else who can do that--but also, he should be standing up for you and insisting that this is an important thing, not letting your stepmom run roughshod over both of you here.", "NTA, but I mean you can't 'tell her' to walk home.  I honestly don't see the point as she will at best just ignore the 'suggestion'.", "NTA - just stop talking to the woman, she doesnt like you, talk to your dad and ignore the (w)/(b)itch", "NTA, but it\u2019s pointless.\n\nYou can\u2019t force her to do that, your father is the only one who can. Suggesting it is just fuelling fire for the fight to keep going.\n\nHe\u2019s your father, if he wants to drop you anywhere, he doesn\u2019t need her approbation. Half an hour without him is not you actively keeping him away. It could be hormones, it could be that she\u2019s always been close to crazy, but this is not straight thinking.\n\nBut also, he\u2019s her husband and he wants to drive her everywhere anywhere, he can and will. And he doesn\u2019t need your approbation either.\n\nBut, she\u2019s insulting you, and that\u2019s not OK. Talk to your dad and try to make it stop at least. You don\u2019t seem to have a great relationship with her anyway, maybe moving out as soon as you\u2019d be able to safely do would be great.", "You should trade stepmom's with Cinderella. You'd get a much better deal.\n\nAs you say, she never wanted to be a step parent. And she obviously resents the fact that her husband has a child that isn't hers. And evidently, she's never made up her mind to try and work past it. The fact that you're living in the same house, yet she demands you have no part in her child's (which would be your half-sibling) life is patently ridiculous.\n\nWhere is your father in all this? It sounds like she's trying to push you to leave by being as insufferable as possible.\n\nBut to answer your question, YWBTA. You're asking a pregnant woman to walk an hour in an unsafe area. I get that you don't like your stepmother. I don't like her either, and I've only just heard of her. But let's not ask her to do something dangerous for her and her unborn child.\n\nGet your license, get a car and move out. If your father won't teach you, then there are driving instructors you can go to.", "There are so many AH's here it is hard to keep track.\n\nBoyfriends mum - She is legitimately suggesting that 2 vulnerable women walk through a dangerous area at all hours of the day and night just to make a point and stop a petty squabble. Don't take her seriously. R\\*pe and m\\*rder happens.\n\nYour dad - he could stop all this. He has a wife and atleast 3 kids and he apparently can do nothing but sneak around and tell half truths and avoid responsibility.\n\nYour stepmum - she has no right to tell your dad how to raise you or what he can and can't do. She shouldn't be yelling at you or body shaming you and her disappointment about you is irrelevant as her opinion is irrelevant to you.\n\nOP - \"third child which I openly admit being against. However, I support their decision to have more kids...\" You clearly do not. You are an adult with a job. Save up to move out and get your own licence. There is a startling lack of you yelling or arguing or anything really. Put the full story in next time. Not just the info that you think makes you look good.    \n\nESH and yes asking her to walk would make you an AH.", "NTA have someone else teach you how to drive and take you to get your license. She isn't your bio parent she doesn't get a final say with you and your 18 so don't listen to her anymore.", "Don't do it, don't want it on your conscience if things go south.  Move out and get on with your life.", "This dilemma is so minor. There's no way you should walk to work; and neither should she. The pettiness and ignorance ugh.\n\nESH.\n\nBut, your Stepmom is an abusive toxic asshole. If you remain in the household, you will become more and more like her. Your real challenge is to prepare yourself to move into a different environment as soon as possible. \n\nYour dad appears nice from your post so maybe you should discuss all this with him and figure out a plan. Oh and buy a ninebot scooter. An hour walk will be 8 minutes on the scooter. You need to take a step towards independence. \n\nPS, dont get pregnant.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Have you considered that her sleep may be disturbed by your father getting up early? That she may need more help aroound the house and with the other children?\n\nPerhaps instead of making spiteful and unhelpful suggestions you can work on a plan that makes life easier for everyone in the household."]}
