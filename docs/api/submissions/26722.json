The other family should have realized that and known it would catch up to them eventually.", "I know that I'm going against the grain here, but oh well. NTA. You moved to a home specifically for the school, which is a common thing. The people that move out of the school district while their children still attended were breaking the law. I get that it's hard and expensive to raise a special needs child but that doesn't justify breaking the law. You're children have the right to go to the school, their children need to attend a school based on their address.

Just because the other family was being dishonest does not stop it from being her turn.", "Possibly an unpopular take, but ESH. \n\nThe fact that the US school system is based on ZIP codes is a huge problem. We fund education primarily through property taxes, so the more expensive areas have the better schools. People who can't afford houses in those areas are essentially condemned to a substandard education. So basically, the US public school system is the biggest a--hole here. \n\nThe other family in this situation sucks because they were breaking the law. Even if it's a law that shouldn't exist, it does, and they needed to follow it. It's my understanding that many districts will accommodate kids and families with special circumstances. At the very least, before moving, the family should have talked with the district about legal ways to keep their kids in their schools. If they needed their kids in these schools, then they needed to move within the district, or find a way to get a transfer back into the district.  \n\nYou suck because you threw another family under the bus.

I\u2019m guessing all of these YTA responses are also people that think you should turn a blind eye to when people are doing stuff they shouldn\u2019t be doing.

They knew they were no longer eligible but lied and would have continued to doing so.", "Obviously NTA.\n\nDon't feel terrible for doing the morally, and ethical right thing against entitled people. You pay taxes which goes to the local schools. Entitled people have no say.", "NTA.

When a civilian calls the cops it\u2019s just them reporting a crime. \n\nI understand you think I\u2019m an asshole and I accept that but we should teach our children to speak out against wrong doers.", "and because of that we were unable to provide after school extracurriculars.", "As you said in a previous comment \"family is family.\"", "You\u2019re grossly over estimating how this is going to play out in school. \n\nMost kids won\u2019t even care. Three will max. This isn\u2019t a movie.", "My job as a parent is to look out for my chidlren.. not other peoples children. \n\nWith that said, the special needs child being moved also allowed another child with needs being given a spot. A spot his parents pay taxes for.. does that not seem fair at all?", "I don\u2019t think you understand school funding.", "Federal taxes fund interstates and the federal government gives money to states for upkeep on infrastructure.\n\nSchools are funded by local property taxes.", "Nah. They\u2019ll be fine. This is an elementary school. I\u2019m not sending them to class with slytherin.", "Do you honestly think that kids care what other kids parents do? Unless the ones ousted were the most popular kids in the school, no one will care at all.", "Absolutely.", "It wasn\u2019t harming op kids. Op just wanted their kids to be able to walk to school.", "Why not they are breaking the law? Why are you willing to smile and nod along to jaywalking?", "Or they would end up incredibly late to school one day, there were a few of situations like this in my grade and my favorite time was when a girl was late because someone's cows escaped and we're blocking the road.", "How do their parents feel about it?", "That\u2019s creepy, dude.", "Is inner city schools vs the school I want my kids in some kind of code perhaps?", "Not really. When parents in the school knows that OP will throw their kids under the bus any chance they get they're not going to be opening their arms to her or her kids for fear. You think those kids are the only ones not being honest about where they live?", "Your job isn\u2019t to look out for your children at the expense of others.", "This isn\u2019t about them, it\u2019s about you and what you did. I\u2019m not talking about jobs, I\u2019m talking about what makes someone an asshole vs not an asshole    If you cut in line at a circus to get your kid the last balloon, you\u2019re an asshole", "Trust me I do. A lot of people will live outside of a district and still send their kids there, they just pay a separate tax towards that school", "Not really my point. The point is that it shouldn't matter if they pay or not", "Not every district is funded this way, though. For instance, zero property taxes in my district fund education\u2014only business taxes do. If this were my district, I\u2019d say what you did was straight up evil.", "OP said in a comment that they moved there specifically for the great school, implying that this school is better than the one their kids got sent to. If this school is better then OP did 100% the right thing. A parent's job is to look after and do what's best for THEIR kids, not look out for some random person's children. OP did the right thing.", "The parents don\u2019t pay the taxes in that school district anymore, they don\u2019t get the benefits of that school. It\u2019s that simple.", "The crime harms no one and is over quickly.", "I was informed by one of them. Most of them understand. The only thing negative I have heard is \"I just don't understand why them moved knowing everything.\"", "Yeah.. better education lol.", "I think you want to be angry about this and you\u2019re not looking at it logically.", "So, what should OP have done? Nothing? That\u2019s not a realistic answer. OP made a tough call but the correct one.", "I get what you\u2019re saying, but what was he suppose to do then? Just gripe and deal with it? He informed the proper people.\n\nLook, I get it, I\u2019m a teacher and I teach in inner cities. Kids from the burbs are going to have is very tough, but that is their parents fault. \n\nOP didn\u2019t actually do anything wrong.", "That\u2019s not how his or her school operates. It\u2019s unfortunate but that\u2019s how it goes sometimes.", "It's actually not that simple. The benefits of education far outlast the K-12 years. People in all areas benefit from people being better educated. The US school system shouldn't be funded on property taxes.", "The question is does op only do it when it benefits their family. If they heard another family doing the same thing would he report it again? Or no because his kids at the school they want.", "Technically not true. There are deaths caused by people who jaywalk at night time and drivers don\u2019t see them quick enough not to hit. \n\nMy sil had two cousins who were sisters died from getting hit by car while jaywalking.", "Righhhht. Look my kid went to a less desirable school (there were people who weren\u2019t white there\ud83e\udd2f ) and she graduated cum laude from law school and was hired by a top ten firm in a major city.", "I want to be angry \ud83d\ude06 okay... I thought I was up at 4am doing assignments but nope I was trying to be angry the whole time.", "Yes, she can do nothing. That is a realistic answer.", "She hurt people for her own gain", "She did. She dogged on someone else and now complained that people are upset with her. Her kids' enrolment might have been accepted, but they're not going to have any friends as their parents will fear that OP will make reports on whatever they may or may not be doing. She did what she thought was right for her kids, but she killed her and her kids' reputation.", "But it is. So you are legally required to send your children to the according school district that you pay taxes in. Also, the benefits do outlast k-12, that\u2019s why OP set her kids up for success.", "School shouldn\u2019t be funded by property taxes. That\u2019s not the question.\n\nThe question is should OP willfully neglect the long term needs of her children by not ensuring they get the education her taxes pay for. \n\nThe question is why do OP\u2019s children - who\u2019s parents are following the law - deserve a quality education less then the children who\u2019s parents aren\u2019t following the law. That\u2019s the question.", "Who cares if they only do it when it benefits their family? OP shouldn\u2019t put some rando kids whose parents are breaking the law above their own.", "Sounds like it was over quickly then?", "Thats awesome! I'm proud that your child is doing well in life!", "Did she attend the school that was in your district?", "As a teacher, we teach our children accountability and process decision making. \n\nWhomever taught the other children\u2019s parents did not do a great job because it is the parents who failed them.", "And her children would suffer because someone else is in the wrong? Would you do the same to your children?", "Someone who was doing something illegally, who was hurting OP for their own gain. See how that works here? So OP has to be the bigger person, when she is legally and maybe even morally correct? What would you do - sacrifice your children's education and comfort for this?", "She or he did not harm anyone. Again, they called the proper people and informed them of a real legitimate problem. \n\nThese rules exist for real reasons, and I know they are often hard to swallow but OP didn\u2019t write the law or rules. He or she is looking out for their children. The other parents failed to do that.", "OP said they live behind the school and have kids over every weekend. Most people won\u2019t care tbh.", "Yeah I don\u2019t think so. I think the parents in that sun would do the exact same thing. The kids will be clueless.", "Yeah... f--- those poor people. \ud83d\ude44", "But logic still applies that family is breaking the rules. Im sure there are other families on the waitlist. Why wouldn\u2019t op also report other families?", "Not the drivers and families that were affected.", "And yours could do just fine if their parent weren\u2019t a snitch.", "No. Actually for a couple of grades she went to the nasty horrible Title I school where I worked.", "You are acting like OP\u2019s children will be denied an education unless she acted. That isn\u2019t the case at all. They wouldn\u2019t go to a preferred school. That isn\u2019t \u201csuffering\u201d by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nAnd, yes, I have made decisions that \u201churt\u201d my kids for the benefit of others. My eldest just graduated. He was in competition with another student for valedictorian. The other student got into a fight right before Christmas, which is grounds for expulsion. I am on the board of the school and have considerable swag with the administration (my committee determines whether to renew staff & staff salaries). I lobbied the administration to not expel the other student.\n\nThat is one dealing with education, I can point you to others as well.\n\nBut, it is AH behavior to do something that could greatly harm someone else while providing you with a marginal benefit.", "Do you really think they \u201caccidentally learned\u201d that a family had moved even though they didn\u2019t know the family. They had to have looked up where they lived and found out it wasn\u2019t in the school district solely to get their kids in there. Admittedly I don\u2019t have children so I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d do for them, but I can\u2019t imagine doing this to people when I don\u2019t know their situation\n\nOP wasn\u2019t being the \u201cbigger person,\u201d they were only looking out for their own interest. They didn\u2019t do it so that the law was followed, they did it for their family\u2019s own gain", "I\u2019m not going to put random children over my own, especially when they\u2019re breaking the law to my detriment.", "Because she didn\u2019t run a full blown investigation of every family in the school. She happened to find out about this one and reported it.", "That's up to the families that are still on the waitlist to prioritise their own children and do what's best for their children.", "They'll be fine.", "Was her getting to attend a perk of you working there?", "And so was the family that was there already? No, OP was not being the bigger person (did you even read my post?), but why should she be? OP is already in the school district but her kids were being excluded from attending the schools because of the other family (who are doing something illegal). Is that fair?\n\n**Since you do not have children** and do not understand the consequences, why are you so adamant about this?"]}
