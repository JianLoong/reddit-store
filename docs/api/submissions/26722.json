You moved to a home specifically for the school, which is a common thing. The people that move out of the school district while their children still attended were breaking the law. I get that it's hard and expensive to raise a special needs child but that doesn't justify breaking the law.

Even if it's a law that shouldn't exist, it does, and they needed to follow it. It's my understanding that many districts will accommodate kids and families with special circumstances. At the very least, before moving, the family should have talked with the district about legal ways to keep their kids in their schools. If they needed their kids in these schools, then they needed to move within the district, or find a way to get a transfer back into the district.  \n\nYou suck because you threw another family under the bus.

Here\u2019s the thing: they also get way less per child because they live in lower income neighborhoods. Most school systems base it on property tax.  The property tax only funds schools in the immediate district and not the entire city or county system. \n\nThe district is a small part of the overall school system.  Keeping the tax income limited to districts instead of the system ensure that the poor stay less educated and the wealthier kids keep getting a premium public education. \n\nAt least if they distributed it from a pot collected by the entire system and then divided by child, the poor districts will see a little relief in funding. \n\nSource: Mom\u2019s a retired teacher from a district with a poverty rate over 80%.

And some get federal funding, primarily for school lunches and such. Poorer districts tend to get more of both of these than richer ones.\n\nSo I wasn't sure if you were talking about just property taxes or all sources of funding.", "I agree wholeheartedly!!! My only difference would be slightly more per child to account for cost of living. If a teacher lives in say NYC, and has to pay $3,000/ month for her and her families 2 bedroom apartment, and the teacher who lives in a small Upstate NY town, where the same 2 bd apt only costs $850, the teacher in NYC will need more pay. But other than the COL increase for teachers and staff, the buildings, libraries, sports, amt of computers per student, etc. Would be the same."]}
