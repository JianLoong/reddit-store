I get that enough from owners at work, dont need it from my BF. He apologized and said he doesnt think he is ready for a dog after all and when the time comes, hes happy with looking at dogs from the shelter I work at\n\nso, the issue with his friend. I did something I had NEVER done before, asked to see his phone, their messages. friend got a very one sided version of events (thinking I unfairly vetoed him) but never used any derogatory language. showed him what this friend sent me and he was pretty taken aback, told me he would deal with it. if he doesnt this relationship cannot continue\n\nand money... that was hard. tried to be gentle but it feeds into a deeper issue with his mom (not a new issue), and I told him enough is enough and I cant keep supplementing his income because he gives so much to her. Something happens and suddenly has a big medical bill? car randomly breaks down? obviously I would help him. money for psycho mom? no. done. her, or me. he chose me. going no or low-contact with her, and absolutely no money, even if she does her manipulative bs. we'll see if he holds to that. if he doesnt, he knows Im done", "created_utc": 1682736133, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132h6e3/update_aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_is/", "score": 138, "replies": ["I am overjoyed to hear that such an awful imapsse led to a potentially truly productive breakthrough .\n\nWhatever happens in the future,  at least it will happen from a place more grounded in real communication and,  as heartbreaking as I imagine it was, I think it is truly important that he has come to understand some hard truth about his childhood dog & how terribly neglectful his adults were.  I can only assume that the neglect was not limited to the family pets. This set of realizations,  though,  coupled with the current need to change his relationship with his mother is A LOT to take in. Would he consider a few sessions with a therapist to help him process this? \n\nI wish you both all the luck in the world and,  separately or together,  I hope you both thrive.", "#[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zoxs8/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_is_financially/)", "NTA. It sounds like you had a productive conversation with your boyfriend and he is willing to make changes. It's understandable that you were hurt by his disregard for your professional opinion and his lack of concern for the health of his previous dog. It's also reasonable for you to set boundaries around financial support and his relationship with his mother. It's good that he chose you over his mother and it's important that he follows through on his promises. Keep communicating and working towards a healthier relationship.", "Good luck with him going N/LC with his mom. I mean this sincerely. Growing up in that dynamic is a process to break out of, and I hope he does.", "Sometimes a dog is just a dog. And sometimes it's not. \n\nSounds like a super productive conversation and a mature response to conflict (even if he is pretty naive about dogs).", "Poor D.  The moment I read \"...thought D was always very healthy\" I knew that disaster was coming.", "Good luck, he doesnt have one issue to fix for your relationship but like 3", "Wow, I never hoped for such a great update.  Better than just breaking up, it sounds like this was a huge breakthrough.\n\nI hope your bf is getting some help for these issues, because they are A LOT.  He is lucky to have you, but he needs his own supports, too, and you need him to have them.\n\nGood luck to you both.", "I'm glad you talked him out of it. And this is coming from someone that kind 2 pugs. Your right they are very expensive pets. I got mine from a very reputable breeder so lu kily very little health issues, but still had to get both of them rhinoplasty to open their airways up. Plus the preventative stuff. I love my pugs very much but they are Def the kind of breed that you need to absolutely stay on top of vet care with."]}
