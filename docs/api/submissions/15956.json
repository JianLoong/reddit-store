I get that enough from owners at work, dont need it from my BF. He apologized and said he doesnt think he is ready for a dog after all and when the time comes, hes happy with looking at dogs from the shelter I work at\n\nso, the issue with his friend. I did something I had NEVER done before, asked to see his phone, their messages. friend got a very one sided version of events (thinking I unfairly vetoed him) but never used any derogatory language. showed him what this friend sent me and he was pretty taken aback, told me he would deal with it. if he doesnt this relationship cannot continue\n\nand money... that was hard. tried to be gentle but it feeds into a deeper issue with his mom (not a new issue), and I told him enough is enough and I cant keep supplementing his income because he gives so much to her. Something happens and suddenly has a big medical bill? car randomly breaks down? obviously I would help him. money for psycho mom? no. done. her, or me. he chose me. going no or low-contact with her, and absolutely no money, even if she does her manipulative bs. we'll see if he holds to that. if he doesnt, he knows Im done", "created_utc": 1682736133, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132h6e3/update_aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_is/", "score": 468, "replies": ["I am overjoyed to hear that such an awful imapsse led to a potentially truly productive breakthrough .\n\nWhatever happens in the future,  at least it will happen from a place more grounded in real communication and,  as heartbreaking as I imagine it was, I think it is truly important that he has come to understand some hard truth about his childhood dog & how terribly neglectful his adults were.  I can only assume that the neglect was not limited to the family pets. This set of realizations,  though,  coupled with the current need to change his relationship with his mother is A LOT to take in.

It sounds like you had a productive conversation with your boyfriend and he is willing to make changes. It's understandable that you were hurt by his disregard for your professional opinion and his lack of concern for the health of his previous dog. It's also reasonable for you to set boundaries around financial support and his relationship with his mother. It's good that he chose you over his mother and it's important that he follows through on his promises. Keep communicating and working towards a healthier relationship.", "Good luck with him going N/LC with his mom. I mean this sincerely. Growing up in that dynamic is a process to break out of, and I hope he does.", "Sometimes a dog is just a dog. And sometimes it's not. \n\nSounds like a super productive conversation and a mature response to conflict (even if he is pretty naive about dogs).", "Poor D.  The moment I read \"...thought D was always very healthy\" I knew that disaster was coming.", "Good luck, he doesnt have one issue to fix for your relationship but like 3", "Wow, I never hoped for such a great update.  Better than just breaking up, it sounds like this was a huge breakthrough.\n\nI hope your bf is getting some help for these issues, because they are A LOT.  He is lucky to have you, but he needs his own supports, too, and you need him to have them.\n\nGood luck to you both.", "I'm glad you talked him out of it. And this is coming from someone that kind 2 pugs. Your right they are very expensive pets. I got mine from a very reputable breeder so lu kily very little health issues, but still had to get both of them rhinoplasty to open their airways up. Plus the preventative stuff.

That poor dog though \ud83d\ude22", "Yeah, this will last about two weeks.", "Pugs unfairly get a bad reputation.  Like most purebred dogs, they are at higher risk of health issues than most mutts, but they tend to be fairly long-lived, and the most common issues are not life-threatening (like vision problems).  And they tend to be very happy dogs, even when they do have disabilities.\n\nMost people wouldn't consider a Golden Retriever unhealthy, but they have one of the highest cancer rates of any dog breed.  And don't get me started on Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, nearly all of which eventually get heart disease.\n\nI suspect your dislike of Pugs, in particular, is a bit biased and unfair.", "Your boyfriend sounds so much like my ex that I feel queasy. I\u2019m glad you were able to discuss the issues. I hope he learns to save and gets away from his toxic mother, for your sake and his.

I hope your partner is okay while he processes.", ">I can only assume the neglect was not limited to the family pets\n\nUnfortunately you are correct. he was raised by just his mom and she was... not great. but that's his story to tell, not mine. but it resulted in him feeling like he has to be responsible for her now, like he was back then. I was also raised by an abusive/neglectful mother and parentified as a child but him and I have resulted as opposite in many ways relating to that. I have been low contact (couple times a year, maybe) with my mom for a long time now. I understand the struggle though so wasnt quite as willing to immediately toss the whole relationship like many (well intentioned) commenters wanted me to over it\n\n>therapy\n\nhe actually was in therapy previously and we talked about him going back and he is pretty on board with it. he only stopped due to money. I think it's a pretty worthwhile expense though and he agrees so we will do what we have to for it to happen", "yeah.... with the background I knew about how he grew up I had a feeling of what the situation was\n\nbut again, he was a literal child. he shouldnt have had any responsibility around the dog's medical care or \"known\" about their issues or what should have been done", "thank you, I came from a very similar background to him so I know firsthand how hard it is. Even if we broke up, he is a genuinely good person and I'd want to support him trying to break out of the abusive cycle with his mom", "yeah, and I get the fixation with a childhood pet if they were the only comfort you had in an abusive/neglectful/unstable household though. honestly, I think that's why I work with animals now. one of my most vivid childhood memories was when my mom made me sleep on the porch as \"punishment\", in the winter, in the PNW, and our house was in the middle of the woods. I ended up curled up in the doghouse on the porch with the dog we had when I was a kid and he licked my face whenever I cried and kept me warm. I still get emotional when a dog that looks like him comes through the shelter and usually have to go take a break by myself to regain composure\n\nmy BF was being a major AH before, but with the context I know now and him being willing to admit he was being an AH, I dont really hold a grudge over it", "well, I made my feelings and expectations abundantly clear. Im willing to do my part, he knows he has to also if he wants us to stay together", "Yip. \n\nMy purebred pomeranian has a lot of health issues. \n\nMy rescue only now has a problem at 5 years old because she tore her cruciate and has hip dysplasia,  not uncommon for large breeds.\n\nMy cat that I got from a pet shop only ever went to the vet 3 times besides her annual shots before she died. \n\nProblem with pure breeding, you know the lineage but if you're not prepared for the higher risk of health problems then you shouldn't get from a reputable breeder. Cause I don't consider backyard breeders at all.", "yeah.. I felt a bit guilty for making him realize what the dog had actually gone through, especially when he started crying. I think that made him realize how poorly his mom cared for the dog and got him cross enough with her to agree to distance himself from her. he was a kid, he didnt know any better", "maybe youre right, but I am wanting to try. breaking up without giving resolution a chance isnt how I want to approach relationships", "I have to disagree with you. The issues with brachycephalic dogs, pugs in particular, are [well documented](https://cgejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40575-022-00117-6#Abs2) and a [current hot topic issue within the vetmed community](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/pugs-anatomical-disasters-vets-must-speak-out-even-bad-business). and it doesnt help that owners of brachycephalic breeds are notorious for being unable to recognize breed related illness in their own dogs. [there was even a study backing this up](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6641206/)\n\nand just because a dog is alive for a long time does not mean their quality of life during that time is good. just because an issue is not lethal does not make it not serious or incredibly harmful for the animal\n\nmy opinion on pugs and other brachycephalic breeds is based on the research and lived experience of myself and my colleagues across the vetmed community. there is a reason a lot of the people most vocally against brachy breeds are those with a background in vetmed. it's hard to see their issues firsthand with an educated perspective and NOT be against their continued breeding", "I'm sorry both of you got the short end when it came to parents but I am glad he's open to getting some professional guidance.  It would be a great thing if this were the catalyst for truly resolving some of the trauma.\n\n(I get the feeling that you have a lot less crap that isn't resolved, if you're thinking \"how is this broad so sympathetic to him, but brushing my shit aside?\" There's a clarity in the way you express yourself that makes me believe that you have mostly made peace with the demons you haven't slain, maybe even made friends with a few \ud83d\ude09....and if you two are staying together,  you definitely deserve for him to have more resolution so his past intrudes less on your present and future)", "As a kind gesture, it might sound silly, but could you buy him a stuffed pug toy to remember D with. When my childhood dog died, I was heartbroken. She was with me through my parents' divorce, 2 custody battles and my mums death, and a lot of other BS that isn't as bad as what some people experienced but was crap for me. A family member gave me the soft plush teddy bear holding a photo frame, and I put a picture of her in it, and I cuddled it for a while whenever I missed her.", ">  I felt a bit guilty for making him realize what the dog had actually gone through, especially when he started crying\n\nYou tried to warn him subtly the first few times but he didn't listen.", "well I have been in therapy on and off since I was a kid so I have a bit of a head start lol", "Ugh I want to give your bf a hug for the realization his beloved dog was suffering. My mom was not a good mother but was a devoted pet parent. The cats were treated way better than me - including actually getting medical care and special diets.\n\nWhich may sound terrible but those cats were my lifeline and so precious to me and I think it weirdly helped a *lot* to see them properly cared for.

So, could be a great investment, not just psychologically. \n\nGood for you for setting some really good boundaries with him about what you wanted your money spent on (I.e. not supporting him while he was propping up his mother).", "His fixation with the pug makes sense now.", "Honestly it sounds like this is the best possible resolution at the moment. The question is will he stick to it in the future, and you just have to wait and see. This is definitely positive though."]}
