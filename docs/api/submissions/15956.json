I did something I had NEVER done before, asked to see his phone, their messages. friend got a very one sided version of events (thinking I unfairly vetoed him) but never used any derogatory language. showed him what this friend sent me and he was pretty taken aback, told me he would deal with it. if he doesnt this relationship cannot continue\n\nand money... that was hard. tried to be gentle but it feeds into a deeper issue with his mom (not a new issue), and I told him enough is enough and I cant keep supplementing his income because he gives so much to her. Something happens and suddenly has a big medical bill? car randomly breaks down? obviously I would help him. money for psycho mom? no. done. her, or me. he chose me. going no or low-contact with her, and absolutely no money, even if she does her manipulative bs. we'll see if he holds to that. if he doesnt, he knows Im done", "created_utc": 1682736133, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132h6e3/update_aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_is/", "score": 1869, "replies": ["I am overjoyed to hear that such an awful imapsse led to a potentially truly productive breakthrough .\n\nWhatever happens in the future,  at least it will happen from a place more grounded in real communication and,  as heartbreaking as I imagine it was, I think it is truly important that he has come to understand some hard truth about his childhood dog & how terribly neglectful his adults were.

I ended up curled up in the doghouse on the porch with the dog we had when I was a kid and he licked my face whenever I cried and kept me warm.

You can perform surgery on a Pug or Frenchie to widen its airways or nostrils, but you cannot surgically give it a new skull. Your argument comparing cancer in Goldens to the health issues facing Pugs is spurious.\n\nA healthy Golden Retriever that develops cancer IS healthy, until it develops cancer. It is not BORN with cancer. A brachycephalic dog is BORN brachycephalic and does not \"develop\" brachycephaly later in life.\n\nI also see that you place more value on a health issue being \"non-life-threatening\" than you do on the quality of life that the dog has with its issues. So, if a Pug has severe entropion (which is painful), or skin fold dermatitis (which causes irritating chronic itching and pain), or brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome (which causes respiratory distress and overall stress) those are all okay, because they are \"non-life-threatening\", correct? \n\nPugs are also extremely prone to hip dysplasia, with over 64% of Pugs in a 2010 OFA survey being diagnosed with hip dysplasia. Pugs are ranked #2 on the list of breeds with the highest instances of hip dysplasia. Hip dysplasia can lead to arthritis and pain, but it is \"non-life-threatening\".\n\nThe animal could be suffering, possibly every single day of its life, and could possibly be suffering from *multiple* issues that are common in the Pug breed, and it may have an extremely poor quality of life, but that's fine, right? Because all of those aforementioned issues are \"non-life-threatening\", unlike cancer.\n\nAlso, the average lifespan of a Pug is 12-13 years, which is comparable to other breeds of its size, so it is not particularly \"long-lived\" as a breed.\n\nI suspect your defense of Pugs and your minimizing of their extreme and prevalent health issues, which are well-known and well-documented, is *also* a bit biased and unfair.", "When he's ready for a dog, if it's not too emotionally painful, he could look into puggles or retromops! The retros are especially cool as it's a coordinated effort to return pugs to their original standards of being slightly funny looking but otherwise perfectly athletic little dogs. They often compete in agility trials!
