When you notice someone has integrity, it\u2019s a sign they\u2019re trustworthy, a good person to be friends with, someone you want in your life. It\u2019s a characteristic that helps to develop a strong sense of self and enables one to be a valued community member. So, you lacked integrity in this instance.
