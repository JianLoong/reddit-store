It\u2019s a characteristic that helps to develop a strong sense of self and enables one to be a valued community member. So, you lacked integrity in this instance.

And how is that pay determined? By the business, and communicated in the form of a bill. \n\nMy argument would be that the restaurant has the duty to bill correctly. Or if they bill incorrectly, to catch it.", "We thought it would come out of the owners pocket (which I now know is incorrect) who make millions more than we do, so that\u2019s how we justified that. So I guess the question is, is it wrong to take from rich people if you are hurting for money? And I think that\u2019s why people are arguing in the comments, it\u2019s a broader question. Although it is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things seeing as now I know it comes out of the waiters pockets. But now I know.", "Nope. Had this happen to me a few times and you know what I did? Pointed it out to the server that they gave us the wrong table\u2019s receipt and paid for what I actually ordered like a decent person.", "Society and civilization flourishes when everyone in it acts in good faith; it dies when people start justifying shitty behavior is okay because \u201ctechnicalities\u201d.", "Yeah. Depending on the restaurant, the server who made the mistake may be required to make up the difference with money taken from their tips. If the restaurant eats the cost and spares the server, then are they really that soulless?", "I want to know if OP left a decent tip in relation to the $200 bill they should have paid\u2026 or the $38 bill they actually did pay. Did they leave the server $40 or $7.50 at 20%? Not that it makes their actions less crummy, but they seem to be using it as a way to delude themselves into thinking they didn\u2019t totally screw over the little guys.", "It\u2019s illegal to dine and dash, too, but it happens. At the end of the day, the person most likely to feel the consequence of OP\u2019s action, legal or not, is the server.", "It\u2019s so sad that you\u2019re such bad people that you spent ten minutes debating whether or not to steal and still landed on it. You really decided that was the correct and acceptable move \u2014 in some ways that\u2019s even worse than people who wouldn\u2019t think about it at all.", "\u201cI\u2019m not an asshole, I argued with my husband before I agreed to steal!\u201d", "Even if the server didn\u2019t because they worked at a decent restaurant that ate the cost of their workers\u2019 mistakes\u2026 wouldn\u2019t that mean she\u2019s screwing over a good boss trying to do right by their workers? How is that much better? Because the boss, OP assumes, can afford it?", "This is AITA tho not am I legally in the right or not.", "Maybe. Obviously \u201ctheft\u201d has a legal definition, but is also used colloquially to describe similar actions that are not necessarily prosecutable. \n\nE.g. one kid steals another kid\u2019s eraser. Not a crime but still a theft.", "The prices for what you are consuming are clearly communicated to you in the menu provided at the start of the meal so that you can chose items that fit the amount you want to spend.\n\nI don\u2019t think human error when calculating the bill at the end absolves you from the need to pay for what you consumed.", ">is it wrong to take from rich people if you are hurting for money?\n\nTaking stuff that isn't yours is wrong, yes.\n\nAnd if you're \"hurting for money\" you don't need to go out for $200 fancy meals.\n\nThat's not a necessity. It's not like you were stealing bread to keep your children from starving in the cold.", "You did not do anything illegal, but you did do something wrong. YTA.", "Fine then. You were wrong, and YTA. Good enough?\n\nEdit: How is stealing from the restaurant owners morally better than stealing from the waiter? That loss has to be made good by someone.", "Good for you, but like every single person on here is against her when you know very well that not every single one of them wouldn\u2019t do the same thing.", "Now the server was fired - you make a lot of assumptions. But you're entitled to your opinion.", "That\u2019s very much untrue. A large chain does not get affected by something like this, again, unless it\u2019s in the case that it\u2019s franchised.", "I dated a woman who worked as a server at this high end local chain seafood buffet with about 4 locations. $50 a plate. \n\nPolicy stated that if anyone dined and dashed, she was responsible for their bill. It would wipe her out and it happened quite frequently, as the buffet didn't do anything to help prevent it. One time I picked her up after work for a date and she was sobbing because they'd made *her* pay *them.* Absolutely criminal. \n\nI actually worked as a server way back when at a national chain (you've heard of it) and they wouldn't make us pay back anything if someone took off. \n\nLocal buisness doesn't always mean good business practices. Sometimes a big buisness has the funds or is just more willing to eat costs that a small buisness can't or won't. And sometimes what we think is a \"big buisness\" is actually owned by a franchisee, and is more like a small buisness in terms of operating costs.", "That's illegal in all 50 US states to make a server make up cost from a stiffed tip or a comped meal. Just a friendly reminder. If your boss tells you you're responsible for dine and dashed meals, ask for it in writing and report it.", "Should've left them what, $162 minimum? Since they ordered at least $200 worth of food/drinks but only paid $38. So even if that is their attempt to make themselves feel better, they're still dicks lol.", "But she left a decent tip, guys! ETA: /s just in case, ha ha", "No, what\u2019s sad is deciding someone is a fully bad person based on one mistake. I never felt comfortable with it, I let my husband make the choice and I came here to see if people agreed with him or me. I was curious to see both sides since this is a question of morals. And I know my husband is a good person. We have been hurting for money and put aside money to celebrate and took advantage of someone\u2019s mistake because of that. If you base someone\u2019s entire character on that then that\u2019s sad. We made a mistake, does not make us bad people.", "Yes, you are correct about the purpose of this sub, and OP is YTA. But this is not theft, as the top comment in this thread suggests. Theft is a legal designation, and this is not it. This is immoral, but not illegal. And it is not theft.", "You example is theft in a legal sense. It might be too minor to bother prosecuting, but it is theft formally and not just colloquially. What OP did is not theft. It\u2019s immoral - I think we agree about that - but it\u2019s not theft.", "Not all menus and restaurants have prices. And the business adds taxes afterwards too. The final bill is the first time you see all the charges. \n\nI agree it\u2019s normal to have human error, and if the business caught the mistake before they left, it should be fixed. A waiter had to print the bill, run the card, and add the tip. 38$ bill was viewed by staff a minimum of 3 times.", "That\u2019s true, I guess it would make it more morally grey if we were in dire straits stealing from a rich person", "We tipped $60", "Well, read far enough and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s not 100%. There\u2019s definitely a small minority of you who are fine with admitting to the internet that you\u2019d be okay nabbing a little old lady\u2019s purse if she accidentally walked off without it. You\u2019re not mugging her, after all; just taking advantage of her mistake.", "It does happen.  It shouldn\u2019t but it does.  You even said it yourself:  \u201cif that (the server getting fired) the case.\u201d  So yes, if it DOES happen, it IS her fault.", "That actually was criminal. An establishment cannot force a server or other staff to cover a dine and dash.", "I know the Applebee's I used to go to wouldnt take it out on the employees. I was in there with my partner when someone dined and dashed and my partner was so worried about it being taken out of the waitresses pay. They assured us it wouldn't but my partner still left them a big tip.", "That\u2019s all fine and good, but obviously something being a crime doesn\u2019t prevent it being done to someone. \n\nIn this case, if the restaurant made the server pay the difference, then OP essentially conspired with the restaurant to commit a crime against the server. Just because there are now two parties responsible for victimizing the server doesn\u2019t let OP or her deadbeat husband and relative off the hook for their part in it.", "Yeah, if they tipped out the difference in the actual bill, then at least the server wouldn\u2019t be out their own money if they\u2019d been forced to cover the rest of the bill.\n\n(But of course we know that is not what OP and her party did.)", "Seeing as how you\u2019re refusing to acknowledge any of the comments that say you can go back and make things right, not so sure it was a mistake. Everyone is hurting for money doesn\u2019t mean you get to steal from someone else.", "My sister worked at a restaurant that did this. They all knew it was illegal, but people needed their jobs. There are workers that don\u2019t have the luxury to just quit or hope there isn\u2019t retaliation if they report to the labor board. We are in the US where waitstaff rely on tips. At the time she worked there, she was getting paid $2.30 an hour before tips. Even with tips, she couldn\u2019t really save up money after paying her bills.", "If your friend loses $200 at your house and you find it, is it then your money? After all, it was their job not to lose it. \n\nSometimes things can be \u201cnot your job\u201d and you can still be the asshole for not doing them.", "OP admitted they know the bill should have been $200. They knew they signed up to pay $200. The prices were clearly communicated to OP before the bill.", "If you had read all my comments you would see I didn\u2019t thank anyone who agreed with me and I commented that I realized we made the wrong choice.. but I still wouldn\u2019t call myself a thief, just taking advantage of a situation", "Yeah, my guess is they tipped on the $38 and left patting themselves on the back for their generosity.", "I\u2019m not saying I would. I just think it\u2019s ridiculous seeing someone getting lectured over and over by people who would do the same thing.", "But it happens, and the low man on the totem pole is always the victim. The dine-and-dashers not only committed theft against the restaurant, they also played as conspirators to the restaurants committing theft against their employees. \n\nOne criminal does not make the other criminal less of a criminal.", "Who says we aren\u2019t going to fix it? I have acknowledged all of the comments who say we did the wrong thing and I have come to that conclusion, but just because we made a mistake does not make us bad people. Stop fucking assuming things about people.", "Expecting a higher bill isn\u2019t the same as signing up to pay it. Bills often come back lower due to discounts and deals and promotions that are applied at checkout. \n\nAdditionally it\u2019s not uncommon for strangers to pay it forward, maybe the last costumer paid a portion of the bill and the myriad of waiters forgot to communicate that. \n\nRegardless of knowledge, the duty of the costumer is to pay the bill. A company has the resources and duty to make sure the bill is correct.", "Thieves take advantage of situations. Just because you don\u2019t consider yourself something doesn\u2019t make that true.
