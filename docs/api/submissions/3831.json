When you notice someone has integrity, it\u2019s a sign they\u2019re trustworthy, a good person to be friends with, someone you want in your life. It\u2019s a characteristic that helps to develop a strong sense of self and enables one to be a valued community member. So, you lacked integrity in this instance.

We never imagined it would hurt the waitstaff.", "This.\n\nYTA", "You do realize the point of this post was to find out if what we did was wrong, right? I have no reason to lie, I did not have any idea that it might affect the waiters in any way. I was always told that waiters are paid a very small hourly rate and then their tips, so I assumed the rest would have no bearing on their paychecks, only the business owners.", "Well I mean I do feel bad, I never wanted my husband to do it in the first place. But I\u2019m not gonna sit here and agree that it\u2019s the same as telling someone an untruth, if the waiter would\u2019ve noticed we would\u2019ve said oh yes of course change it. I think there is more grey area than people are allowing for.", "Even though it is illegal in most states to deduct mistakes from employees pay, you can Google and find that it is somehow still the norm to punish employees this way in the restaurant industry...", "And yet you didn\u2019t. YTA", "I mean, sure, but as someone who's worked retail that's also a different kettle of fish because:\n\na) Walmart doesn't change the worker's pay *directly*, but they do change policies that affect the employees in a negative manner (like putting frequently shoplifted items in locking cases and making them have to take time away from other tasks to go unlock them) and often results in pay loss indirectly due to making them out to be \"less productive\" when it comes time for bonuses/promotions.\n\nb) They also ignore it *deliberately*, at least for the petty shit, because they're waiting for the shoplifter to either become a chronic enough problem or steal something valuable enough that they can hit them with the big charges.", "Yes, restaurants really do this.  They will find the person who was responsible for not catching the mistake or the one who added the numbers wrong, and it comes out of their pay.  A cashier who undercharges mistakenly will also have to make up the different in pay.  Both my kids worked in retail, and both had costs deducted from their pay if a mistake got by them.  Companies are so rich because they don't lose money from their own pockets.  It's the small workers who get the brunt of it.", "If lowering to zero counts then sure", "Luckily, I'm looking to be of service. It may be rude to make assumptions, however it's also natural to do so. \n\nOnce a cheater always a cheater is something not many people argue about. Same goes for thieves and cheapskates. So I don't think it was too far of a stretch.  \n\nI'm glad he at least tipped, but I doubt it was a $200 tip that would have made up for the difference.", "Got it. You are not a cheater. You are a 10 min later- cheater", "The fact that you discussed it for 10 minutes makes it even worse. You KNEW what you were doing is wrong", "Hundreds telling you, that you are in the wrong. Quit trying to justify your actions. You stole the money owed.", "So fucking fix it then.", "Everyone is telling you what you did is wrong. You're all mad because people are (rightfully) calling you a thief. If you're not one and if you're getting the clarification you sought are you going to go pay your tab today or?", "Waiters can often have to pay for discrepancies out of their pay. If your tip didn't cover the rest of the bill, the server who will get the blame might have to cover the cost. \n\nSo, are you calling them to fix the error or going in?", "I don't really see what's morally grey here. Sure, they messed up. Doesn't mean you didn't lie by omission and steal though. Multiple things can be true at the same time. YTA by the way, in case that was unclear. So is your husband actually.", "Listen, when I was younger <i used to work odd jobs. They would make you recount everything for any differences between what is expected to be in the money drawer and what really is there and you could be fired for pennies missing.\n\nwhat do you think will happen to someone with a 100+ $ mistake ?\n\nare you comfortable putting someone\u2019s job in jeopardy ?", "Because they don\u2019t enforce their rights. Nearly every state has some form of employment agencies were you can file grievances and actions at a much quicker rate and cheaper cost than litigation.
