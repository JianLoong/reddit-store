You do not need to accommodate them for their bad decisions.\n\nNTA", "NTA no - they are the ones who want to change the living arrangements, they are the ones who need to move.

We moved 9 times before I graduated high school.", "That sucks so damn much! \n\nIn your shoes, I'd contact everyone else you work with, carefully suss out who wants to continue wfh, and if it was over 50 percent, start a rebellion. \n\nBut I'm a  \"fuck these rules, they are illogical, and I'm not going to just roll over because you said so\" type. Defiant, noncompliant, without overt aggression, but absolutely immovable, no negotiation. I faced down the U.S. Army, when I was in, risking imprisonment...and I succeeded. Because the rules were antiquated, not actually part of the official code (UCMJ), and frankly, idiotic and discriminatory; and far too many others were with me. I broke no actual law; just refused to comply with the \"unwritten, but understood\" ones. The Army tried to ground me, if you can believe that, lol. I said \"you have no grounds to restrict my movement\", and walked off base anyway. Shenanigans followed, but in the end...I won. That rule has been changed since then, much to my amusement.\n\nIt can be done. Do your research about any precedents, other companies similar or nearby that are still remote, and have a backup plan, be prepared to jump ship. But most importantly, get as many on your side as you can, and all of you be prepared to say, \"nope. Make me. Make us\". Enough of you means you'll have *them* in a tight spot. Few companies staff to the level they should, let alone with redundancy. This means that if even 20 percent of their workforce rebels, they are fucked. \n\nThe other colleagues who want or feel obligated to go back to onsite will give you shit. Lots of shit. Too bad. Let them be mad. The rest of you, give them zero reason to complain about you, document everything everything everything, send emails after phone conversations about those conversations as word for word as possible, immediately after the conversations \"just to confirm per our phone discussion (date and time)\", lay a paper trail. Not for a lawsuit. For accountability.", "Gotta suck for the lessee if someone they traded with damages the apartment. Or are students not liable for the damage they cause?"]}
