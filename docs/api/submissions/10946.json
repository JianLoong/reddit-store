It\u2019s a perfect time to start setting boundaries.", "NTA. Your Mum sounds like she\u2019s emotionally abusive.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your Mom is jealous of the baby? Those are really passive aggressive comments to be making. Two weeks isn't long at all, and all your reasons are valid.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is selfish as fuck.\n\nThe next generation is always more important.  You have a 2 week old baby!?!\n\nTake care of yourself and your baby.  Your mom is acting like a whiny ass toddler. Ignore her.", "NTA. Leaving a breastfed 2-week-old for the night, or taking them to a restaurant are both completely non-viable options, as no doubt your mother is aware. I\u2019m sure you are used to this kind of passive-aggressive behaviour from her. Just ignore it and carry on with your life as a new parent. Congratulations:)", "NTA!\n\nYou have a new born. I don't blame you for not wanting to take a 2wk old to a gathering with a bunch of people and I couldn't imagine leaving a 2wk old with a sitter. Your mom was being unreasonable. It's like she forgot what it was like to raise young kids. Good luck with this type of grandma! It sounds like she's jealous of her own grandchild.", "NTA, you just pushed a football put of ypur vagina. You're entitled to at least a month of excuses to not leave the house. And her comments are only \"jokes\" because they didn't make you feel bad like she intended for them to.", "You are a first time parent with a brand new baby. Your mother is on something if she thinks you are going anywhere. I am so sorry. She should be a help right now, not an additional stress. So completely NTA.", "NTA 2 weeks is a fair reason to decline. It sounds like your mother is a bit of a drama queen, but perhaps you could mitigate this by inviting her for lunch sometime in the near future.", "Those kind of comments would piss me off even more and definitely make me not want to go. However on a useful note, you could offer (if you feel up to it) to host a lunch or supper at your house for her at a later date (with the help of hubby) so that way if you need to breastfeed you can do so in the comfort of your own home. Idk just a thought?", "NTA. I don\u2019t have a kid but you can be sure if I do, I won\u2019t leave them with anyone alone at 2 weeks old. Also if you ares till recovering that that\u2019s also a reason not to go. You have to rest.", "NTA. Her comments about you not loving her after giving birth are also manipulative. Time to answer, \u201cyou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t love you anymore,\u201d or \u201cyeah I really don\u2019t want to see you again\u201d and just go LC with her until she starts to behave. She wants to act like a brat? She can be put in time out like a brat.", "NTA\n\nWanting to stay home with a baby new enough that you're still recovering from the birth is a perfectly valid reason to bow out of anything. \nThe whole 'you don't care about me anymore' shtick is a lame gimmick practiced by narcissist parents.", "NTA, but if you were going, why wouldn't your husband and daughter be going along?", "NTA. Your mum, having had 4 kids, should remember that at 2 weeks you are exhausted, still bleeding, likely still getting used to breastfeeding etc. and your baby is somewhat vulnerable in a restaurant as they haven\u2019t yet had any vaccines and more so because there\u2019s the virus that shall not be named everywhere. She\u2019s trying to emotionally manipulate you.", "Your mom is passive -aggressive and needy.  You just HAD A BABY for God's sakes!   She needs to grow the hell up.  You are NTA.", "NTA. Your mom is being a passive aggressive biotch.", "NTA.  Your mom is being passive-aggressive.  Don't fall for it.  Stick to your guns.  A good breastfeeding regimen takes time.  At this point in your child's life, your milk has come in and in copious quantities.  It takes a while to regulate correctly.  Plus feeding demands ebb and wane a lot in the first three months of a child's life.  You should be focused on properly feeding your bundle of joy and anyone who doesn't respect that isn't worth losing sleep over.", "NTA. Your priority is the baby and her welfare. Her being as a mother too, should understand your situation and not gaslight you.", " NTA. At two weeks, I was still bleeding, breastfeeding, sore from stitches and had cabbage leaves stuck down my bra to soothe mastitis. No I did not want to go out anywhere lol.\n\nYour mother has clearly forgotten what it's like and is being unbelievably selfish, unreasonable and unsupportive. It sounds as though she's queen bee in your family and everything revolves around her. \n\nTell her: 'guess what, mother, there's someone new in my life making demands on me now, and since they're too weeks old, they take priority over a grown ass woman. Stop being so needy and start getting on board otherwise you won't be seeing much of us going forward.'", "When your newborn is more mature than your mother, that's when you know you're NTA. What a despicable thing to say to your daughter, ABOUT YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER. And then saying \"it's just a joke\"; which part was the funny part mom?", "NTA, this is a massive change and childbirth is very consuming. if she was upset, she can communicate better than snarky remarks. YTA if you cancelled last second. you mentioned it\u2019s a usual occurrence, and you\u2019ve had your baby for 2 weeks. surely you should\u2019ve had time to talk and figure out what\u2019s doable and not beforehand", "Your mom is manipulative and controlling. She's also selfish and probably narcissistic. She isn't joking. She's excusing her behavior by saying it's a joke, but she's actively trying to guilt you into doing something you do not wish to do. If she says something like that again, don't argue, and don't give in. Say 'good joke, Mom. You're so funny. Take care now, I've got to run.\" And walk away. She will learn that  you will preemptively agree it's a joke and that the result for her will be that you will no longer participate in her guilt or manipulations. NTA", "NTA.", "NTA- you made the right decision. You're going to make plenty more decisions for yourself and your baby that she has no say in and likely won't agree with. Establish a respect 'my parental boundary/decision making/ authority' early on and stand firm in it. \n\n>My mom was upset with me though for not going and she keeps saying things like \u201cI get it, you don\u2019t care about me anymore\u201d and \u201cI knew you would never wanna see me anymore after having the baby\u201d. Whenever I get mad at her for saying those things, she says she was just joking. \nAsk her to explain the joke. Point out the punchline.

You are exhausted and going through the most significant change of your life. You don't need this.

We go to restaurants with them. But the earliest we took them was at two month or so. When we all had adapted to the new situation, i was fully healed and and well again and breastfeeding went well. But within the first two weeks? Nope...", "NTA\n\nBaby comes first.  Your mother's carrying on in this manipulative, self-centered was is pretty vile.

I just saw a commercial about babies getting rsv and parents running to the hospital with them. I have a new grand baby. That scared me. I wouldn't want to take any chances that my grandbaby would get sick. Two weeks old is just too young. Your mother's little jokes are odd and not funny at all, too. What is her malfunction? You're NTA, but your mother sure is.", "NTA my mom is the same exact way and wants all the attention on her.

You might have a newborn, but your mom sounds like the biggest baby in this story.", "NTA\n\nYou have a newborn w no immune system, why on earth would you go to a restaurant w your baby? Your mother is emotionally blackmailing you. Ignore her comments.", "This!", "She was the same way when I got married. My siblings had to deal with this stuff too. She gets so mad and jealous anytime we go through something that makes us not see her as much. I mean I do kind of understand though because her mother was pretty detached with her, so now she\u2019s too attached to us.", "I can't speak for OP but speaking for myself I wouldn't dream of bringing a 2-week old to a crowded restaurant.", "I wouldn\u2019t want to bring a newborn into a restaurant. She\u2019d be disturbed by all the loud noises and she\u2019d probably disturb others too if she\u2019s crying.

It's her mother's duty to support her through the tough weeks, not make demands on her physically or mentally. She's a shit mother and a drama queen to boot.", "Excellent advice.", "Then you could explain to her that you are now going through exactly the same thing - you want to be with your child 24/7. She must surely understand that a 2 week old baby demands this attention, but a woman of her age shouldn't need so much. That it isn't normal and will eventually drive her loved ones away.", "A routine. At 2 weeks. Seriously, is she high? No one has a routine at 2 weeks with their first baby. You haven't slept in days, your boobs are doing weird things, and your body is still healing. She is a hot mess. Ignore her.", "NTA at all. That is plenty explanation and you had all the right to do what you did."]}
