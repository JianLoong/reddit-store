Why the hell are you paying their bills!??", "NTA.  My opinion is you\u2019re being taken advantage of by your family and they do not care one bit.  In addition to having you foot their bills, they stole cash from you.  You\u2019re NTA for asking for it back.  Will they actually return it? Likely not.  Moving forward I see it as you have two options.  1.  Stop paying for your family members.  Hold them accountable for their own lives and their own bills.  2.  If you continue to pay for them, set some strict boundaries. Protect yourself first.  Never give them cash or checks.  Pay the companies/creditors directly.   If any refunds are being issued, have the refund go back onto the card that was used for the purchase.  Bottom line, protect yourself first.", "NTA. It's ok to be upset when someone steals from you, and then lies about it when asked directly about it. I wouldn't be paying for any more extras for either of them going forward. Just remind them that they obviously already have $250 cash that they took from you the next time they ask for something.", "NTA.  \n\nI would take this as a perfect opportunity to cut them off, financially.  Anybody asks, the answer is NO.  NO excuses, no explanations.  Just a firm NO.  End of discussion.", "NTA. You have every right to feel upset over your mother and brother stealing from you. They\u2019ve become so accustomed to taking advantage of you, they don\u2019t see an issue with going into your belongings without your knowledge or permission and just selfishly taking. And for what? When you\u2019re already paying 90% of the bills. \n\n\nYou should stop giving them money. Pay whatever share of the bills, but stop giving them money outright. If you feel like helping them pay for something, instead of giving them the funds, put your money directly toward the bill. This way, it\u2019s completely up to you as to what your money goes to.", "Info: is it $300? Or $300 + 90% of the bills? Do you live with them? Are they restricted from working?", "NTA. BUT dont let them money never again. Did you live with them?? If these its the case, please, find your own place and tell them that its your money, and if they need more, they have to figure out, BUT you dont wanna give money to people Who dont respect you, lie to you and stole from you.", "Nta.

Eventually, they will cause you to lose your job or worse. Get out now, while you can afford to do so. They are selfish bums who steal, lie, and cheat their way through life. You (somehow) came out of that household with a moral compass-not sure how-but if you don\u2019t leave, they will keep you trapped. And do not give them another penny until (maybe) you leave them any savings in your will.\n\nThere is something fundamentally horrible about a parent who takes money from their kid.
