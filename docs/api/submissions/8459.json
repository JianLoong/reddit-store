Ok, whatever. It\u2019s her job. I get it. I declined again and then she went \u201cIf you can afford to take care of a dog then you can afford some $5 cookies.\u201d That struck a nerve and I blew up at her saying she was setting a terrible example for her daughter and $5 to her isn\u2019t the same $5 to me.

That's the end of the interaction.\n3. Shall we count the number of different ways the mom breached the Girl Scout Law?", "This is an easy NTA. Is there anyone who can give you a lift to the food bank? I am more concerned about your situation than a woman and kid selling cookies. There are organizations that will also help drive you depending where you are.", " NTA. It\u2019s unfortunate this happened in front of the child but it sounds like her mom behaves this way often enough that she\u2019s seen this kind of behavior and response before.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, I have a daughter who is a girl scout.

She's setting a terrible example for her daughter and that is not how sales are supposed to happen.", "NTA. You played nice, twice even. Even when you exploded, you didn't utter anything a child shouldn't hear someone say (to their mother). She fucked around, you made her find out.\n\nI hope your situation improves soon, OP.", "NTA. A nice valuable lesson for the daughter to witness. Badgering a potential customer to buy a product is wrong.

That's completely against every bit of training parents and kids get regarding girl scout cookies. I'm sorry that happened to you.", "NTA. One of the lessons the girls are SUPPOSE to learn is dealing with rejection, not high pressured sales tactics.\n\nWhen my own child was selling them, we were ADAMANT that when someone said no, you thanked them and moved on.", "NTA The girl scouts do not promote harassing people into buying cookies nor do they encourage scouts or their parents to harass, belittle and demean people.  The girls scouts is mission is to help girls build their courage, confidence and character to make the world a better place. All you did was put this odious woman in her place.", "NTA.
