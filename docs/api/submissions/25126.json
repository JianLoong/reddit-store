{"id": 25126, "submission_id": "15wmbxo", "title": "AITA for refusing to eat with my Stepchildren during their latest stay?", "selftext": "I (28F) have been married to a wonderful man (31M) for two years. He has two children from a previous relationship (10F) and (7M). They didn't work out because they got together too young and weren't compatible, it wasn't anything in particular that broke them apart and they are still close to this day which I fully support as it's best for their children. \n\nI am currently 11 weeks pregnant and dealing with brutal morning sickness, I can barely stand to eat and the sight and smell of most food especially meat sends me running. Because of this during my stepchildren's latest visit I talked to them and explained that their little brother/sister was making it hard for me to be around food right now and so their Dad would be eating meals with them at the dining table every meal over the next three days but I wouldn't be and it wasn't because I didn't want to be around them or anything was wrong. My plan was to grab small plates of food (without meat) as and when I felt able rather than trying to force myself to eat at meal schedules.\n\nI thought it was fine and my husband felt i'd explained it great to the kids, so I didn't dwell on it beyond that. Today a few hours after their Mother picked the kids up she phoned us upset and demanded to talk to me, she then began to talk about how it was so rude i'd not eaten a single meal with them and that i'd made them feel unwelcome and unwanted and things along that line. I tried to explain that i'd told them that my morning sickness is just very bad right now and it had never been my intention to make them feel that way and I hadn't known that. I asked to speak to them to explain this again but she refused, then began to say how this was clearly an excuse as she'd never had morning sickness that bad and how even if it was the happiness of the kids should come first and how could I expect to be a good Mother if I didn't know this?\n\nAt this point I was getting teary as my emotions are all over the place and my husband seeing this realised something was up and took the phone off of me to find out what was going on. They ended up arguing and he told her he'd come see the kids tomorrow to clear this up but that she wasn't allowed to speak to me that way. \n\nHe keeps assuring me that I didn't do anything wrong and that it could be his ex is perhaps feeling odd as he's having another kid but that it's something she needs to come to terms with if so. I myself am less sure, as if the kids made a point to tell her perhaps they're also upset and it's not just her saying this? I never want to make them feel unwanted or unwelcome and I don't want them to feel like the new baby is pushing them aside. Should I have handled this in a different way? I just feel overwhelmed right now.", "created_utc": 1692564102, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wmbxo/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_with_my_stepchildren/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This led to their mother being upset with me as she feels I made them feel unwanted, unwelcome etc and that I should have pushed through it.

My guess is she is the problem, not the kids. Let your husband deal with it. Good luck with your pregnancy, hopefully your morning sickness will pass soon. Best wishes for a healthy baby.", "NTA. The kids probably told their mom you have morning sickness so they ate with dad the whole time. She flipped it to use against you and make you the bad guy to the kids.", "NTA, sounds like ex is upset that you\u2019re pregnant. The kids probably went home and told their 7/10 yr old version of \u201cStepmom got sick and dad said she can\u2019t eat with us\u201d totally innocent but ex spun it because exes do that when breakups and baggage aren\u2019t dealt with properly. Get ready for the crazy to ramp up as the pregnancy progresses and birth happens.", "NTA. Remind her no two pregnancies are alike.  Just because she didn\u2019t have it that bad doesn\u2019t mean nobody does.  I\u2019m very glad your husband has your back.\n\nShe became the total asshole when she tries to say the happiness of the kids comes first and you won\u2019t be a good mother.", "How welcome would they have felt if you spewed all over their meatloaf?", "NTA - you are sick. End of story, and the why doesn\u2019t matter. If you had a chronic Illness would she say the same? Kids may have mentioned you weren\u2019t eating with them as you usually do. You are doing good, just worry about your health right now.\n\nIf you are worried about your morning sickness affecting your child talk to your GP or OBGYN depending on who would be better, and request a nausea medication that pregnant women can take. If you are in the UK try 111 as well, they may be able to triage and sort something out same day.", "NTA. No two pregnancies are the same. You even took the time to explain to the kiddos why you wouldn\u2019t be eating with them. A cousin of mine actually had nausea so bad she couldn\u2019t talk because the slightest no it h movement could cause her to throw up and she actually ended up in the hospital to try and regain weight. You do you. Talk to the kids again. Offer to spend time with them outside of meals.", "NTA. You just don\u2019t want to get sick. That\u2019s all. It is nothing against her kids and I doubt they felt it was until she put the idea in their heads.", "NTA. You had a legitimate reason for not being able to eat with them and communicated it to everyone clearly. If they think it\u2019s an excuse and refuse to believe you that\u2019s not your fault, they have their own insecurities and emotions that they need to work through without projecting them onto you in a hurtful manor.\n\nIt seems like a good idea for your husband to go over there to talk it over, hopefully everyone can come to a more compassionate understanding of your situation.", "NTA. It\u2019s her issue. You were up front and clear about the situation with everyone", "Okay definitely NTA \n\nI get she\u2019s protective of her kids and may be a little fearful that yes you\u2019ve been good to them now but when your own child comes are you still going to be?\n\nNonetheless your partner is right she absolutely does not get to talk to you that way at all. We all have our own experiences and pregnancy is not the same in any woman. You know you\u2019re not trying to hurt the kids feelings and she knows that too.\n\nA little while for you both to calm down and talk would probably put all of this behind you both. Reassure her that her children still have a place in your heart and you simply just cannot be around food at the moment. But that doesn\u2019t mean you around spending time with them when it\u2019s not food time.", "I would go no contact with her. Let your deal with.  I wouldn\u2019t respond to texts or answer your if it is her. She is not entitled to treat you this way.", "NTA but the ex wife certainly is. I had super bad morning sickness so I completely empathize with you. Hopefully your partner will explain on your behalf and the ex calms her shit down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She doesn\u2019t get a say in what goes on in your home and she certainly isn\u2019t a medical expert who gets an opinion on your pregnancy symptoms. \n\nDon\u2019t waste more time worrying about her. \n\nFocus on spending other quality time with the kids next time they visit.", "NTA - Either there was miscommunication with the kids (which happens to the best of parents at times) and can be easily addressed or the Ex is just being a b*. Either way, NTA.", "NTA- she\u2019s clearly triggered and it\u2019s her problem not yours. Congratulations and I hope you get help for the morning sickness.", "\"she'd never had morning sickness that bad\"\n\nWell she just got lucky. She could have been another Kate Middleton, whose body reacted to pregnancy with hyperemesis gravidarum. Your husband's ex was totally out of line talking to you that way, and you and you didn't do anything wrong. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nThis seems like she displaced negative issues from somewhere else onto you and this. Maybe you having his kid bothers her and she doesn't feel ok to express that anywhere. Maybe some other issue with the kids exists and she failed to communicate that. It may be something entirely different. Either way, you absolutely are not the Ahole. This is clearly her issue. No sane person has ever said morning sickness or having it triggered by smells isn't real. \n\nJust wait until you can talk to the kids (with him there) to see what they really said. They are young, and miscommunication is super easy. Clear up any that exist. It's also likely non exist and she is just crazy. Either way, the kids and your relationship with them are your concern. Not her misplaced anger and idiotic statements.", "Thank you, i'm planning to bring it up at my next appointment but if it gets worse before then i'll ring up 111 for sure.", "I'm sorry about your cousin! i'm thankfully not that bad currently though I dread potentially getting worse as i'm miserable enough right now. I spent time with them outside of meals to be clear we watched movies, played games and went to the park I also did my stepdaughters nails as she liked how mine look.", "Thank you, of course having a biological child would never make me care for my stepchildren less. I love them and care about them deeply and i'd also do my best to not play favourites. I know that is something i'll need to work on once the baby is here and am not about to promise that I will without hesitation as it'd be instinctive at times to favour your biological child but I will be actively working to ensure I don't do that.  \n\nOnce tensions are less i'll reach out to her to try and explain this to her I think."]}
