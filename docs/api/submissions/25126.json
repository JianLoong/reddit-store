They didn't work out because they got together too young and weren't compatible, it wasn't anything in particular that broke them apart and they are still close to this day which I fully support as it's best for their children. \n\nI am currently 11 weeks pregnant and dealing with brutal morning sickness, I can barely stand to eat and the sight and smell of most food especially meat sends me running. Because of this during my stepchildren's latest visit I talked to them and explained that their little brother/sister was making it hard for me to be around food right now and so their Dad would be eating meals with them at the dining table every meal over the next three days but I wouldn't be and it wasn't because I didn't want to be around them or anything was wrong. My plan was to grab small plates of food (without meat) as and when I felt able rather than trying to force myself to eat at meal schedules.\n\nI thought it was fine and my husband felt i'd explained it great to the kids, so I didn't dwell on it beyond that. Today a few hours after their Mother picked the kids up she phoned us upset and demanded to talk to me, she then began to talk about how it was so rude i'd not eaten a single meal with them and that i'd made them feel unwelcome and unwanted and things along that line. I tried to explain that i'd told them that my morning sickness is just very bad right now and it had never been my intention to make them feel that way and I hadn't known that. I asked to speak to them to explain this again but she refused, then began to say how this was clearly an excuse as she'd never had morning sickness that bad and how even if it was the happiness of the kids should come first and how could I expect to be a good Mother if I didn't know this?\n\nAt this point I was getting teary as my emotions are all over the place and my husband seeing this realised something was up and took the phone off of me to find out what was going on. They ended up arguing and he told her he'd come see the kids tomorrow to clear this up but that she wasn't allowed to speak to me that way. \n\nHe keeps assuring me that I didn't do anything wrong and that it could be his ex is perhaps feeling odd as he's having another kid but that it's something she needs to come to terms with if so. I myself am less sure, as if the kids made a point to tell her perhaps they're also upset and it's not just her saying this? I never want to make them feel unwanted or unwelcome and I don't want them to feel like the new baby is pushing them aside. Should I have handled this in a different way?

You are doing good, just worry about your health right now.\n\nIf you are worried about your morning sickness affecting your child talk to your GP or OBGYN depending on who would be better, and request a nausea medication that pregnant women can take. If you are in the UK try 111 as well, they may be able to triage and sort something out same day.", "NTA. No two pregnancies are the same. You even took the time to explain to the kiddos why you wouldn\u2019t be eating with them.

You had a legitimate reason for not being able to eat with them and communicated it to everyone clearly. If they think it\u2019s an excuse and refuse to believe you that\u2019s not your fault, they have their own insecurities and emotions that they need to work through without projecting them onto you in a hurtful manor.\n\nIt seems like a good idea for your husband to go over there to talk it over, hopefully everyone can come to a more compassionate understanding of your situation.", "NTA.

We all have our own experiences and pregnancy is not the same in any woman. You know you\u2019re not trying to hurt the kids feelings and she knows that too.\n\nA little while for you both to calm down and talk would probably put all of this behind you both.

Congratulations and I hope you get help for the morning sickness.", "\"she'd never had morning sickness that bad\"\n\nWell she just got lucky.

Your husband's ex was totally out of line talking to you that way, and you didn't do anything wrong. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nThis seems like she displaced negative issues from somewhere else onto you and this. Maybe you having his kid bothers her and she doesn't feel ok to express that anywhere. Maybe some other issue with the kids exists and she failed to communicate that. It may be something entirely different. Either way, you absolutely are not the Ahole. This is clearly her issue. No sane person has ever said morning sickness or having it triggered by smells isn't real. \n\nJust wait until you can talk to the kids (with him there) to see what they really said. They are young, and miscommunication is super easy. Clear up any that exist. It's also likely non exist and she is just crazy. Either way, the kids and your relationship with them are your concern.

I spent time with them outside of meals to be clear we watched movies, played games and went to the park I also did my stepdaughters nails as she liked how mine look.", "Thank you, of course having a biological child would never make me care for my stepchildren less. I love them and care about them deeply and i'd also do my best to not play favourites. I know that is something i'll need to work on once the baby is here and am not about to promise that I will without hesitation as it'd be instinctive at times to favour your biological child but I will be actively working to ensure I don't do that.  \n\nOnce tensions are less i'll reach out to her to try and explain this to her I think.", "Nta. The kids are fine. They went home and told her all about their weekend, inuding the big talk you had with them about their new sibling and being sick, and eating dinner with their dad. That's all. \n\nBut she can't handle that he's having children with someone else and is taking it out on you. I mean, come on, everyone knows what morning sickness is and that it both varies and can be bad. Then she wouldn't let you talk to the kids. This is clearly  her problem, not the kids' problem.\n\nYou're doing a great job, but your husband has an ex that will not make things easy for you guys.", "Id say they didn't make a point to tell her. Maybe the fact that you'd had that conversation with them so clearly, that it stuck with them, so they mentioned it, but I bet any money she dug deeper, and asked questions to get to what she suspected. Maybe not intentionally or consciously... but I bet it's a miscommunication that she refuses to see as one.\n\nYoure absolutely NTA, if anything you couldn't have done it better if you tried.\n\nAwesome for her that she didn't have morning sickness that bad. But she's been pregnant twice. As a guy, I've never been pregnant (despite trying) and even I know every pregnancy is different. Your second pregnancy with the same father could be completely different to the first. And same again with the third.

Not sure how your step kids shared the story with her. Had your husband already told her that you were pregnant? It\u2019s customary in many places to wait until the second trimester, so I could imagine it may have been news to her in the moment or recent news that she was digesting. She may be afraid that you are going to treat her children like second class citizens when the baby comes. Sadly there are some step mothers who do just that. Hopefully that will not be you!", "NTA", "NTA sounds like ex is worried that you guys will treat her kids differently now that you'll have one of your own. It's a common fear and there are many Reddit posts where that has happened. Sounds like she and your husband need to talk this through a bit. You didn't do anything wrong here.", "NTA. I have had similar conversations with my own kids when I am unable to eat due to my mental health issues.", "Nta at all! \n\nWhen I was pregnant with my oldest son (18) I had morning sickness so bad that I couldn't keep anything down. Barely could keep water down. My doctor told me eat whatever I wanted in reason just so he could get nutrients. Some people get morning sickness or what I like to call it \"All Day Sickness\" extremely bad or not at all. Just because she doesn't have it that bad doesn't mean you won't.

Your needs were met.\n\nEx is in the wrong for gaslighting you about your own morning sickness, first of all.\n\nSecond, she took the kids' information and filled in the blank spots with a story that fit what she felt like. That's on her.", "NTA- your husband needs to have a stern talk with his ex.", "Nta sweetie. I couldn't eat or be near the smell of meat until morning sickness past. The ex had an unreasonable reaction. I think you explained it well to the kids. If this continues block the ex for the time being.

Your explanation was perfectly reasonable, and your partner\u2019s ex is being wildly *un*reasonable in her response.

Each time the kids return from a visit to your husband, she pumps them for intel to see if there's something she can twist into a complaint, an insult, an attack.\n\nAt last she found one, even if she had to utter stupid BS to make it into a crise. She probably tried to goad the kids into feeling unhappy and it didn't work.\n\nEven if she gets married again, she will never stop looking for an opportunity for mischief. Some ex-wives are like that.\n\nNTA. Your condition is simple to explain and you gave it to us with great clarity. I'm certain your kids get it and just hope you feel better soon.", "Anyone else notice how people raising kids in broken homes are always so ignorant?", "Unequivocally this", "This. NTA", "She and the children already knew about the pregnancy we'd have liked to keep things hidden until I was a little further along however given they stay with us three days every week we didn't want them to be scared by how sick I was or risk them learning by overhearing anything so we decided to just tell early. I'd of course never treat them like second class citizens.", "There's a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum. Princess Kate had it for the entire first trimester of each of her 3 pregnancies, and my niece had it every single day of all 3 of hers. Basically it's excessive vomiting during pregnancy, and it can leave the mom-to-be seriously dehydrated and potentially undernourished.

Seriously 9 months of constant illness.  Things you could stomach the day before set you off the next day.  I mainly lived on slushies to get me through.  Honestly the kids may not have understood well enough but one time watching you go green and running to any basin close enough, would send that message clear.   \n\nDon\u2019t apologise to anyone because you need to take steps from being sick.  When others compare themselves to your pregnancy and tell you they never had it so bad, you must be putting it on - just tell them lucky you, I\u2019m sorry but I fail to see your point why I would carry on if it wasn\u2019t true.  To this day I can\u2019t tolerate runny eggs any more as it resembles the stomach acid, that comes up when your stomach is empty but still making you I\u2019ll.", "I think your husband is being optimistic in his assumption that the issue is his ex feeling uncomfortable. The kids clearly told their mum almost immediately about the situation so they probably were upset by it. \n\nI also think it's likely the kids may not feel comfortable admitting to their dad that this situation upset them even when he comes over tomorrow. It would be great if you husband and his ex could present a united front when explaining these situations to the kids but I've found through personal experience that these situations tend to be the women's version of \"toughen up\" - many women just don't have sympathy for female issues.\n\nUltimately, moving forward I'd recommend that if you need to do something that could be interrupted as excluding the children that you introduce an additional activity that includes them eg not eating dinner together but instead having ice cream together after.", "NTA, their mom is, though.  I imagine they mentioned the morning sickness in passing, and she latched onto it for whatever reason. She\u2019s making drama on purpose.

You aren't obligated to interact with her at all.", "Or it could get better! I had terrible nausea with both of my kids but in each case it went away after roughly three months.

She was hospitalized with IVs and then had to use suppositories when she was back home because she couldn't take meds orally.", "Put it this way. I'm on 2 different high-strength prescription antiemetics, both maximum dose, for morning sickness. Every few hours. And that is barely enough for me to eat bland food (plain rice, buttered noodles. Chicken noodle soup if I'm really feeling good) most days. \n\nThat's not considered severe morning sickness, and is in no way close to HG.", "I have chronic nausea.  When my niece was pregnant she had horrible morning sickness. One might I was at work and went to buy gum but accidentally got peppermint candy.  Well it is so good for nausea. They would not give my niece more meds so I told her about the peppermints.  They work so good I recommended them to my dog walker who has nausea and he keeps a bag in his car. Sometimes I have to use 2 but they work", "Peppermint, ginger, lemon... Tried it all. My body just isn't a fan of pregnancy and food at the same time. The meds help, which is good. I'm hoping as we get later in the pregnancy it eases up some \ud83e\udd23", "Whatever works.  I once got food poisoning when I went to Florida to visit my parents. I had both ends going, laying on the bathroom floor in pain.  My mother shoved 2 peppermints in my mouth and in 15 minutes my vomiting stopped.", "YTA. You're not even 3 months pregnant, but you are so sick you cannot be around other people eating and you start crying because of pregnancy hormones. Sounds like an excuse, and you're going to be using your pregnancy and later on, child, to get out of things you do not feel like doing.", "Morning sickness is different for everyone. Some people don\u2019t even experience it, doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t happen. She should know that. Honestly I\u2019d just bring a bucket to the table. They\u2019ll understand then.", "NTA. The Ex is.  You did nothing wrong. It would not surprise me at all that they were fine with it and she's just trying to make trouble.", "NTA. Having someone wretch and throw up right in front of you while you are eating is conducive, neither to a good appetite nor to happiness. You did the right thing both for yourself and for them.", "Nta.  The way you explained it was just fine, and I doubt the kids thought much about it, other than mentioning it in passing.  (Mom, \"How was your weekend? Kid, \"It was good.\" Mom, \"Did anything interesting happen.\"  Kid \"Not really.  Well, stepmom couldn't ever eat with us or she would throw up.  That would be gross!  Can I play on my tablet?\")  \n\nMom is either jealous and afraid that YOUR new baby is going to displace HER babies, and projecting that onto the kids and planting seeds of concern in their minds, or it's all just her emotions and the kids are oblivious. \n\nLet your husband take care of it.  It's his ex, it's his problem to deal with.  You just focus on getting through this stage and having a healthy (for you both!) pregnancy.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m also 11 weeks pregnant. And nauseous as all hell. You handled this great, just because their mom either doesn\u2019t remember being pregnant or had a unicorn pregnancy doesn\u2019t mean your valid boundaries with morning sickness should be ignored.", "NTA", "NTA in any way. Stop overthinking and stressing yourself.", "OP if your husband isn't using a shared calendar with his ex the local courts/Reddit probably can recommend one for messaging, setting up appointments, etc. Things are going to become hetch in the coming months so getting everything streamlined and in one place and less of he said she said... the better. Also, for the time being, record all phone calls with her - was she being rude or mean but you're tired and stressed or a bit of both? Also, this let's you double-check dates and times if a baby starts to cry.", "Ignore the ex, she's jealous.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nI think vomiting all over the table probably would have been a bigger issue for the children.  It seems quite likely the children's mother has made this into something the children didn't.  She's trying to make you feel bad. Don't. Each pregnany is different (I'm on my third and none have been the same) ans nobody gets to tell you your symptoms aren't real because they didn't have the same thing you did.  Sounds like jealousy is creeping in because the children are probably talking about their new sibling.  Don't answer the phone to her if she tries this again.", "I just want to add that if OPs husbands ex has had two pregnancies, then she of all people should know that every pregnancy is different, not just every person's experience of pregnancy. \n\nMy first was easy, no morning sickness, my second I had first trimester full of morning sickness but came good during the second trimester. My last pregnancy, however, my food tolerance changed daily as to what I could keep down and lasted the entire pregnancy (I actually ended up losing 10kgs-from pre pregnancy weight- by the time I delivered my baby) and even that wasn't bad compared to some women because I have seen teeth destroyed and one pregnant woman hospitalised due to morning sickness.\n\nOP, NTA, listen to your body and what it is telling you it needs. Make sure you discuss any dietary issues with your pregnancy medical team if you are concerned, but for now, listen to your body.  \n\nI agree with everyone here saying this is a \"hubby's exs\" problem, not a you problem. There are some great apps out there for tracking your pregnancy, the one I used actually showed a 3d image of the baby developing in utero which my eldest two loved checking every Monday morning to see how their little sibling was growing. Maybe something like this in addition to \"a gift from the baby to the current children\" once the baby is born can help include your step children and help them to feel involved and help them bond too, if you are really worried.", "It's definitely this.\n\nYou can tell her intentions weren't pure either because most normal people wouldn't freak out about something like that.\n\nHonestly going forward there doesn't seem to be much of a need for OP and the ex to ever really interact.", "I'm probably going to get hate for this but here goes... 90% of the time during the first 2 trimesters of my pregnancy I was nauseous. If I didn't get enough sleep, brushed my teeth, drank water, honestly the only thing I could really keep down occasionally was some sweet tea, and I was violently ill, like would throw up so hard I'd piss myself everytime, id have to sit on the toilet and throw up in the trash... tmi I know but it was bad like to the point that I was getting worried because I wasnt big at the time 5'1\" and 140lbs and my comfort weight is 145, i look my best at that weight in my opinion.... Now the controversy... It was in the first month of finding out I was pregnant (8+ weeks at this point) and the whole day I could keep anything down. Didn't matter. Noodles, crackers, water, tea, I even tried sweets because that was almost guaranteed to stay down. By the time dinner, rolled around I was so sick from barely getting anything down for 24 hours and general morning sickness on top and I was miserable. Now I smoked weed before I was pregnant but stopped when I found out because I wanted to have as healthy a pregnancy as possible.... Yeah that didn't last long. I should add for context that I have troubles eating. Like one meal a day if I could even stand putting food in my mouth because it turns to sawdust or eating just doesn't appeal to me. I started smoking weed to help that because I was starting to lose weight and like I said there really isn't much for me to lose... So yeah I ended up smoking weed for the rest of my pregnancy, I was upfront at my first appointment and everything, all they told me was here is a paper we have to give you and stop vaping. That was it. I know a lot of people would see it as abuse or being a bad parent but my concern was my baby growing and nothing else. She was little the whole pregnancy especially in the beginning when I was having problems eating, she was in the 12 percentile at my first appointment and was 7lbs 13oz birth weight and didn't even lose the usual weight outside of the womb (maybe 6oz) and was back up by night fall (about 3.5 hours). She is now 3 months old and wearing 6/6-9 month clothes, weighing in last night at 14 lbs 14 oz and I'm the 60-70 percentile for babies. This little girl who worried me my whole pregnancy, until the end, that she wasnt going to make it (previous miscarriage {baby A}, she's my rainbow baby) and that she was going to be so small we wouldn't get to take her home. Yeah, no. The last month I stopped worrying, until labor and her umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck. My baby girl is such a trooper I couldn't be more proud and would be perfectly okay if I never had another, don't get me wrong I want one, but I don't know how I'd ever love anything like her. I gave her, her middle name since it was my best friend/cousin/sister's who passed away,  year to the date before baby A passed. Sorry for the rambling but I couldn't help not sharing with people whom have also had rough pregnancies. Thank you!!!", "Sometimes bodies don't allow you go through your pregnancy the \"perfect\" way. I had a friend in primary school who's mum smoked cigarettes the entire pregnancy (reduced from when she wasn't pregnant) because the stress of the nicotine withdrawals would've been much worse for the baby than her continuing to smoke (she'd previously had multiple miscarriages because of the stress quitting smoking was putting on her body). This was actually done at the recommendation of her doctor because of her history. She had 2 boys and they both turned out healthy aside from asthma for one of them, it wasn't a very severe case either and it may have gone away as he got older but I'm not quite sure, he managed to play sports just fine as a kid though so it certainly didn't hold him back. So smoking a bit of weed throughout the pregnancy to actually be able to keep food down and feed yourself and therefore the baby is quite minor in comparison, and like in my primary school friend's mum's situation probably ended up making for an overall healthier pregnancy than the alternative", "NTA.  She SAID the kids were upset, but were they really?  I suspect she has projected this onto them - they obviously mentioned it, because she would not know otherwise, but I'm betting they never said anything negative about it.", "NTA she\u2019s having problems dealing. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA You explained it very well to the children. \n\nIt's the mom who's got a problem with it not the kids.", "NTA - I bet the kids just said something like you were sick. If they were upset at all, it would have been in a sympathetic or empathetic way. Ignore the ex.", "NTA she was looking for an excuse to start a fight", "You sound stupid do you have kids? Do you know what morning sickness is like? Because if what you wrote I don't think you do", "I had it horribly, I could only keep a few things down and had to switch to drinking half and half just to get enough to not be constantly collapsing. The night before my induction I weighed myself and I was 43lbs lighter than the day I found out I was pregnant, and the medium maternity pants were so baggy they would have fallen off me if they didn\u2019t have the elastic band on them. Even with me visibly deteriorating my ex\u2019s family gave me crap for being a wuss over what they insisted was \u201ca little bit of nausea\u201d since none of them even had morning sickness at all. It can legitimately get life threatening.", "i had HG when i was pregnant with my son, and it was a nightmare. i honestly thought i was dying. i ended up in the hospital for almost 2 weeks, and was sent home with a PICC line for strong IV anti nausea medication and fluids. \n\nprobably the worst 3 months of my life.", "There's a woman I know that has two kids. One she had at like 14 and the other in the last year and shes in her mid-ish 20's. The most recent one, she smoked cigarettes, weed, and did cocaine the whole pregnancy... Baby is perfectly fine except for some respiratory stuff that he can never seem to get rid of. \nMy poor baby is actually sick rn, 2nd time since birth, both times were because her of her Uncle (age 4 then, 5 now) {he was one of Bob Ross's happy little accidents}", "NTA. My eldest sister had hyperemesis the entire 9 months of her pregnancy with my oldest nephew. It was brutal. This isn't your fault. Let your husband deal with his ex and speak to his children. Drink lots of pedialyte to recoup lost fluids if you throw up too much and get some well-deserved rest. Hopefully the morning sickness goes away soon.", "NTA and honestly, there's a good chance the kids weren't upset when they told her. If you ask kids what happened over a very regular thing that was slightly different, they'll often tell you the different bit. So \"Neat_Sample couldn't eat with us because the baby is making her sick\" may have been simple conversation. Or possibly they did express to their mother that they missed you even though they knew you couldn't help it and she's blown up.", "I can't decide between N A H and E S H, apart the kids.You could have done differently at least 2 things: Say that you are ill and you have an upset stomach instead of involving the baby, and sit at the table with them, during a couple of meals, without any meat on the table. Your husband and their mom should have explained better the situation to the children. This goes especially for their mother because they revealed their feelings to her, and she could have calmly reassure them, instead of taking offence.", "Nta", "NTA it could very well be that their mother is just reading into what the kids have told her. The kids have more than likely just shared what\u2019s happening, especially considering you explained it as their sibling is making you a little sick but you still care for them. I think your husband is right, ex is just dealing her her emotions and going momma bear for no reason. \n\n\nI know your hormones and emotions are everywhere and it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone says, you\u2019re still going to feel guilty to the kids because you love them. Why not do a fun activity with the kids to replace you not being there during meal times, replace the time with something else whilst the little belly nugget is getting settled. \n\nYou\u2019re doing great and I think your explanation for why you can\u2019t sit for meal times with them was amazing! \n\nGood luck with your beautiful family", "Or invite her over for a meal... Blast her with the full experience \ud83d\ude09", "The older one probably just said \"OP is having a tough time, she wasn't able to eat with us\" and the ex jumped on it to pretend they were upset about it and berate you", "My first pregnancy was a breeze, I ran four miles a day until the day I delivered. My second pregnancy, I couldn't keep down anything. I wound up with a bleed in my esophagus from the vomiting. Thankfully, my son is healthy and happy.", "Wow thats such a huge difference in pregnancies! Glad to hear your son is well after a rough pregnancy!", " Thank you!", "nta", "NTA the kids probably said what you told them and are fine and it is her who has a problem with you being pregnant, don't let her words live rent free in your head it's horrible being sick so often she is just looking for an excuse to be mean to you, you told the kids in such a lovely way that they wouldn't have been bothered but may just have been worried about you and the baby that's why they mentioned it to the mum, good luck with baby and try ginger biscuits if you can it may help.", "NTA. Would she rather you sit at the table with them with a puke bucket?", "NTA.", "My wife had terrible morning sickness until she started on vitamin b6 and unisom. Hopefully your doc has recommendations to help!", "I have had 5 pregnancies, two that miscarried before the second trimester and 3 that ended with a baby born around my due date.\n\nAll first trimesters where the same and the three second and third trimester I had where too. The birth where all different but all relatively easy, not a lot of pain, no stiches needed, walking around right away, picking up my older kids the same week.\n\nI had insanely easy experiences that didn't change to much. Never have I had any morning sickness. The gastric acid was awful the third trimester, all three times. But that was it. That was the worst of it. Tired and some acid. Big whoop.\n\nI am however very, very aware that I had insane luck with this. And I will never assume other will have it easy too. But saying she had to know all pregnancies are different because she has had two just isn't true.", "I didn\u2019t have hyperemesis but it was very close. I had to carry a backpack with Gatorade, gravol, and little snack foods everywhere I went bc if I even got SLIGHTLY hungry I would be vomiting for over an hour. I probably threw up 10-20 times a day for 18weeks.
