I barely had time to grieve because I was the one doing everything from dealing with the funeral to making sure we had another place to live all on my own. And they feel they can just do and say whatever to me and I\u2019m still supposed to be there because we are \u201cfamily\u201d. Some say it\u2019s selfish I feel this way and it\u2019s inconsiderate of me to not think about them but I\u2019m literally stopping my life to tend to them and I\u2019m not their parent so I feel like that isn\u2019t my responsibility.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your siblings should be independent if they all the over 20, and everyone has to split from their family at one point.", "NTA. They will never grow up and find themselves without a push. You need your own life too.", "NTA - why is this even big moral question? Everyone here is an adult. You aren\u2019t responsible for raising your siblings, or paying their bills. \n\nIf you move out and give up the housing benefits to one of them, you\u2019re giving up your inheritance as well.

You said you are all adults. So you're not abandoning anyone. They need to learn to take responsibility in their own lives and be able to live independently of a mother figure - which it sounds like you were for awhile. Go, live your life.", "NTA! Bounce on their asses. They are adults and you are only enabling them to take advantage of you. They are not your problem to solve You are! I would run so far away asap.", "NTA\n\nI think it is perfectly normal to want your own space from your adult siblings. Best way to move forward is to give them a month or so notice that you are leaving and to sort themselves out ASAP.", "NTA. Your siblings are not your responsibility. You need to live your own life, too.", "NTA go live your life and enjoy.  Your siblings are adults and will figure it out.  They need to learn to be independent and stop mooching off you.", "NTA. You were there when they were younger. Now they are adults, as you are. You deserv your own life. Give them some form of notice. And maybe the equivalent of one to three month rent, if you choose to leave at the same time you tell them (so they can't guilt you to stay). \n\nIf you want, you can still be in their lifes. By calling them or so. But they have to grow up. And if you feel traped, move on.", "NTA. They\u2019re grown. They can support themselves. Go live your life.", "NTA. Unless you want to live this way for the next 40 or 50 years, then you need to put a stop to it now. Now is also the best time for them. They need to learn to be adults before they wind up with more responsibilities. What if one of them gets pregnant or gets a girlfriend pregnant? You will end up supporting even more people. \n\nMy advice: Tell them they have 90 days to make arrangements and PUT IT IN WRITING. Maybe get someone you all respect to be a witness. In most places in the US, 30 days might be necessary. But since it is family and you are feeling (undeserved) guilt/anxiety, I suggest 90. Then they will have no excuse to not save up and prepare.", "NTA\nThey are adults. They can't be dependent on you forever.", "NTA\n\nYou already know what's coming though.  It's the reason you haven't left yet.\n\nYour siblings are not likely to figure out anything and will soon lose that housing without you there.  They will then be homeless and coming to you for help, wanting to move in with you at your new place.\n\nYou need to be prepared for this.  Otherwise, if you let any of them in then, you will have wasted your time moving out in the first place.", "NTA.  If they are adults and mentally competent, you should all be able to live your own lives.", "NTA - sounds like your sibs are using weaponized incompetence to get you to take on all the not fun parts of adulting. You deserve to leave, and they will be better off for learning how to function on their own. I would give them a heads up though - give them some notice so they can start to get all their ducks in a row.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
