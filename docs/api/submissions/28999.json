When I was little, she would always ruin my birthday parties so I stopped having parties with my mom\u2019s family. I usually have parties with just my dads family and my friends. This year, I\u2019m turning 16 so I\u2019m having a bigger party which my dad is mostly paying for but I\u2019m inviting my mom, stepdad, stepbrother and half siblings (13M and 11F). I\u2019m having a party with about 90 people and over the weekend my grandma is gonna take me and some of my friends and cousins to their cabin in the mountains.\n\nI do not want my stepsister to come to the party or to the cabin. I know she\u2019s going to ruin it. She gets jealous whenever I get anything and my dad is planning to gift me my dream car at the party so I know she\u2019s gonna throw a tantrum. She always steals the attention from me and I just don\u2019t want her there. I\u2019m not inviting her to the cabin either because it\u2019s just for my cousins on my dad\u2019s side and my friends. I\u2019m not that close to my stepsister. Besides, we\u2019re going to hike, boat, ride horses, and do other outdoor events that I know my sister can\u2019t handle. She\u2019s gonna start crying if we try to go on the water and she can\u2019t walk further than half a mile without getting tired.\n\nYesterday my stepsister told me that she\u2019s really excited for my party because it\u2019s at the zoo and she loves it there and she has never stayed in a cabin before. I told her that she\u2019s not invited and she started crying and ran to her room. My mom called me an uncaring brat for not inviting her and telling her so bluntly. She said that her and my stepdad aren\u2019t coming either if she\u2019s not invited.

I've also seen so many siblings turn 18 and ghost their parents and entire families, especially those who were being forced to train to take care of said sibling throughout their lives whether they liked it or not.

So disabled people need to survive in the world when they become adults? That\u2019s extremely disgusting. There are plenty of disabled people who never function at that level. Shame on you. I don\u2019t even know what to say. You think a spectrum kid is just going to have to learn how to behave in adults and all of that when some people on the spectrum never do is crazy. It\u2019s not a failure on their part or their parents. Having a disability is not a failure.", "No, not inviting the sister makes no sense if she's going to invite the people who are raising and enabling and supporting the person doing everything they can to ruin OP's life.  \n  \nYou don't punish a dog from a dog fighting ring and then invite the people who trained and fought them to your bday party.", "Really sorry to hear that!

C'mon grandad", "But it is very normal to ask where on the spectrum a bisexual person falls?", "You mentioned clinical setting so I assumed you work at a place since I don\u2019t know if you work at a doctors office or group home, facility can be used. Also ASD level 3 is okay for my medical folder and to make sure my doctors and providers know especially when needed but most people who interact with me would never comprehend what that means and would never place me in that group. I am extremely high masking and high functioning and to the outside world I don\u2019t appear to need any help, until I do. That is what people are trying to explain that you aren\u2019t getting. \n\nMedical terminology, especially when diagnosis is stagnant and actual functionality is fluid, will not fit with layman\u2019s understanding of our outward behaviors. I may be part of a really small group of individuals and I get that. But using only diagnostic is a huge disservice in my opinion and more detrimental than saying high masking or high functioning.

Every child is different and it\u2019s how the parents choose to advocate for that child.  There are many parents out there who work very hard for their child to have the most normal life they can with their disabilities.  Then there are others who just give them whatever they want and never try to help them understand at all.  This is not the child or adult\u2019s fault but those who are charged with taking care of them.  These are the people that their siblings take off as soon as they can because they want a life that doesn\u2019t revolve around the disabled child/adult.  These parents are also the ones who expect their other children mostly the female child to take care of the disabled child when the parents no longer can.  \n\nIn this situation the mom and stepdad give in to the stepsister who happens to be autistic.  So when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants she throws a tantrum while sometimes it can\u2019t be avoided other times I bet it\u2019s easier for them to just give her what she wants.  What happens when they can no longer care for her?  Whose job will it be because the stepsister hasn\u2019t been taught even the slightest coping mechanisms?  Now it won\u2019t work with all children but depending on where they are on the spectrum the parents are doing a great disservice to the child.  Some parents hear the word autistic and any form of normalcy has just been thrown out the window and they give in to everything.  There are parents out in the world who are saints they have a hard life dealing with their disabled children but they try to make it work.  You have many autistic adults in the world who have learned to live life and you would never know they have their quirks.  Their parents worked hard to help them be independent.  This may not be the case for all autistic people but they are people like everyone else but need extra guidance.  Some parents just aren\u2019t equipped to handle the extra work it takes to raise a challenged child.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an ah for wanting to invite her mom to her birthday. It\u2019s really not a good idea though. As for the step siblings, I have no issue with them being invited. If one of my siblings was like that I would still want my parents at my birthday, within reason. We don\u2019t know the intricacies of how they\u2019re parenting the sister, although clearly they\u2019re lacking."]}
