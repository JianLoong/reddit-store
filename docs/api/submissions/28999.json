When I was little, she would always ruin my birthday parties so I stopped having parties with my mom\u2019s family. I usually have parties with just my dads family and my friends. This year, I\u2019m turning 16 so I\u2019m having a bigger party which my dad is mostly paying for but I\u2019m inviting my mom, stepdad, stepbrother and half siblings (13M and 11F). I\u2019m having a party with about 90 people and over the weekend my grandma is gonna take me and some of my friends and cousins to their cabin in the mountains.\n\nI do not want my stepsister to come to the party or to the cabin. I know she\u2019s going to ruin it. She gets jealous whenever I get anything and my dad is planning to gift me my dream car at the party so I know she\u2019s gonna throw a tantrum. She always steals the attention from me and I just don\u2019t want her there. I\u2019m not inviting her to the cabin either because it\u2019s just for my cousins on my dad\u2019s side and my friends. I\u2019m not that close to my stepsister. Besides, we\u2019re going to hike, boat, ride horses, and do other outdoor events that I know my sister can\u2019t handle. She\u2019s gonna start crying if we try to go on the water and she can\u2019t walk further than half a mile without getting tired.\n\nYesterday my stepsister told me that she\u2019s really excited for my party because it\u2019s at the zoo and she loves it there and she has never stayed in a cabin before. I told her that she\u2019s not invited and she started crying and ran to her room. My mom called me an uncaring brat for not inviting her and telling her so bluntly. She said that her and my stepdad aren\u2019t coming either if she\u2019s not invited.

OPs mother didn't celebrate her daughter's bdays and did nothing to change that. That's a lifelong problem. A problem that OP didn't create. Her mother did.

She\u2019ll get mad about that too.", "The problem with that is that my mom and stepdad would not take her home if she threw a tantrum.

Only the fact that no child is obligated to involve someone else at their birthday.", "at the zoo?? Seriously? You can't save the gifts for the cabin? why? A birthday party at the zoo is one thing, but I would not want to be carting around gifts. Do the staff hold on to them for you? Does someone have to take them back to the car? Do you even care about the zoo?\n\nI'm so confused as to how this works.\n\n*Will* she get mad about the gifts?

Without actually being a part of your family, I can't say whether it's deserved or not, but from an outside perspective, it looks really bad that she is the only one not invited.

I find it concerning that you stopped having birthday parties with your mom's family and she never asked you why. You are her child.
