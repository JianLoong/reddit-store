Basically saying unless that thing divorced you, I\u2019m distancing myself have fun bye. \n\nI think this wedding really showed how entitled and spoiled she really is. So good call on getting the hell away from her and anyone associated with her. Keep your peace.", "Not near enough info. I don't think I even undersrand what caused the original problem that got you kicked from maid of honor.", "No you are not.  You gave perfectly reasonable responses to her demands, but you were right she wanted to blow up the situation so she could be a victim.  Good luck to your brother.  There will always be someone being mean to her and he will have to defend her.", "There's a lot going on here. At face value, it sounds like B is throwing temper tantrums at every turn, completely unappreciative of what you've done for her, and flies off the handle if she gets a text message she doesn't like. If that's the whole story, then definitely NTA. \n\nThat said, I'd be very curious to hear from her or your brother's perspective on the situation. Removal as MoH is one thing, but excluding you from the whole wedding is the nuclear option. What drove them to make that change? I'm finding it hard to fathom that it's just about the bachelorette trip and a few texts. \n\nThe part about removing family from the wedding - are they excluding everyone from your brother's family? It's glossed over in your post, but that would be a really big deal as well and speak to much larger issues. \n\nAnd as I write this I just saw the comment from /u/Unusual-Prompt3532 corroborating that B is in fact this toxic.

I mean, did they really think you would still let them get married and party at your home after uninviting you?\n\nNTA.  I'm guessing bride got pissy about you not paying for the whole Bachelorette trip, and it went downhill from there.  I'm sorry about things with your brother,  but I have a feeling the bride is burning a lot of bridges with your family and may not be around as long as she thinks she will be.", "But\u2026are we sure it was the brother who sent that message?", "But to me it sounds like that is exactly what OP did - isnt it better to have the discussion abt cheaper options (which may have been more inclusive by letting other ppl attend w/out financial strain), than to  just cancel it and walk away?
