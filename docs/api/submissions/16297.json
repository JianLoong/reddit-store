This was surprising because the fianc\u00e9 and I have always had some issues. We\u2019ll call the fianc\u00e9 B. I agreed without a second thought because it was for my brother. I\u2019ve helped planned color schemes, bought planners, been dress shopping, even did her makeup for their engagement pictures. All of the normal maid of honor duty\u2019s. No problem with any of this. \n\nThis is where the problems begin. I had planned a Bachelorette trip for B and she was really excited as far as I knew. A few days after I had book the airbnb and finished planning the trip B texted me asking if we could go with a cheaper route on the trip. I responded asking what she else would she wanted to do instead. The only response I got was idk.  So i told B okay I will cancel the trip I had planned. This apparently wasn\u2019t the reaction she had wanted so we did not speak for the next few weeks. I had still been speaking with my brother throughout this time and was waiting for him to get back form work (he works away from home) because I wanted to have a conversation with both of them about what happened with the trip. I had told this to the both of them. \n\nLast night I received this  text message \u201cBrother and B have been discussing some things. We can talk more about it when he gets home if you would like.

This set B off where she told me to lose my attitude towards her she was sick and tired of us walking all over her and that it had been going on for years that\u2019s why they decided to remove family from the wedding. I\u2019ll admit ITA. I asked if she wanted me to gravel at her feet for them to change the decision? i told her that it was my family that had been putting the whole wedding together not hers so her decision to remove family just meant my brothers not hers (Her family hadn\u2019t been involved). That the only way we had ever walk all over B was because she needs  to be the victim in every. single. situation. she had ever been in. I informed her that my brother would always be my brother but i had scraped better thing off the bottom of my shoe then her. Yes this was an asshole response and I know that but I was so fed up with her playing a victim when we had done everything in our power to make this special for her. \n\nI then got a text from my brother saying I was no longer allowed at his wedding, his home or his life that our relationship was done. I told him Okay that i loved him but didn\u2019t want a relationship with him if B was involved. I also told him my home was no longer available for his wedding. They were going to use the pasture for the \u201cvenue\u201d to decorate set up tent, dance floor etc. That was the last of it I blocked B number and social media.

Basically saying unless that thing divorced you, I\u2019m distancing myself have fun bye. \n\nI think this wedding really showed how entitled and spoiled she really is.

I don't think I even undersrand what caused the original problem that got you kicked from maid of honor.", "No you are not.  You gave perfectly reasonable responses to her demands, but you were right she wanted to blow up the situation so she could be a victim.  Good luck to your brother.  There will always be someone being mean to her and he will have to defend her.", "There's a lot going on here. At face value, it sounds like B is throwing temper tantrums at every turn, completely unappreciative of what you've done for her, and flies off the handle if she gets a text message she doesn't like. If that's the whole story, then definitely NTA. \n\nThat said, I'd be very curious to hear from her or your brother's perspective on the situation. Removal as MoH is one thing, but excluding you from the whole wedding is the nuclear option. What drove them to make that change? I'm finding it hard to fathom that it's just about the bachelorette trip and a few texts. \n\nThe part about removing family from the wedding - are they excluding everyone from your brother's family? It's glossed over in your post, but that would be a really big deal as well and speak to much larger issues. \n\nAnd as I write this I just saw the comment from /u/Unusual-Prompt3532 corroborating that B is in fact this toxic.

I mean, did they really think you would still let them get married and party at your home after uninviting you?\n\nNTA.  I'm guessing bride got pissy about you not paying for the whole Bachelorette trip, and it went downhill from there.  I'm sorry about things with your brother,  but I have a feeling the bride is burning a lot of bridges with your family and may not be around as long as she thinks she will be.", "But\u2026are we sure it was the brother who sent that message?", "But to me it sounds like that is exactly what OP did - isnt it better to have the discussion abt cheaper options (which may have been more inclusive by letting other ppl attend w/out financial strain), than to  just cancel it and walk away?

Had she imagined herself in your shoes for a minute, she may have realized you reacting to a manipulation could be a deal breaker.\n\nLiving with you from the age if 15 may have entitled her to equal status as a sibling.  Her parents weren\u2019t involved, living, or generous.  Your family took her in. She decided your family owed her whatever they gave to their own. Can that be the conflict?\n\nWas your wedding one that she needs to match or top in order to secure her position in the family. In other words, would that make her feel safe from getting tossed out one day?  Do she see herself as competing with you and needing you to cater to her so she doesn\u2019t have to feel beholden?", "I feel like we are missing substantial portions of the reality of the situation here...", "ESH", "INFO because I'm struggling to see what you actually did to upset her, so I'm assuming things were left out.

She is going to play the major victim and talk about the hurtful words you said for yeaaaaaaarrsss. You just fell right into her petty trap and gave her more fuel for her victim mentality. When people act like her, just shut it down and walk away. You may have felt fired up and justified but those five minutes of a tongue lashing will be weaponized forever. \n\nYour brother sucks btw.", "YTA for how you reacted, yes. But I don\u2019t fault you for that as I would most likely act the same way if my effort time and energy was so easily discarded.", "NTA. I've been in a similar position as your brother, blinded by love for someone who doesn't get along with my family. Though, to cut you out of his life over a comment like that is a real asshole move.

Then she's throwing a tantrum when you,  gracefully and in an nonconfrontational way I may add, agree and ask to talk to schedule something else. Other than that, you apparently were going to allow them the use of your property for a wedding venue, for free supposedly, because there is no mention of money anywhere in the post. Did I get that right?\nTwo thoughts for you:\n1. It sounds like she was fishing for you to bank part of the bachelorette party cost. I can't think of a different reason for her melt down when you agreed to cancel, otherwise. \n2. How certain are you that the messages you got from your brother's phone were from him? It may be my suspicious brain talking, but it doesn't seam like you contacted your brother directly in any way. Is your brother likely to blindly agree with everything she says without listening to your side of the story?

She baited you into a fight and you obliged her by saying things you didn't need to say. But you know what? Fuck her. Let them sit and talk shit wherever they end up having their cheap wedding.

Mainly because I feel like this is one of those story\u2019s that you need to hear both sides of. It dose seem strange that she would have you as MOH if she didn\u2019t like you. And it seems like they did that because of your brother. You not protesting the removal isn\u2019t about your relationship with her but your brothers. Idk maybe in his mind if you cared you would put up more of a fight. It also seems strange to me that the brother was so willing to cut his whole family out of the wedding. That, her comments about being \u201cwalked all over.\u201d And the way you talk about her,Make me wonder if there is in fact some more to the story we have not heard.\n\nBecause of this I don\u2019t really feel confident in giving a judgement.

This woman is ungrateful, and shame on your brother for allowing her to treat you this way! Seriously, pull the plug. She can plan and pay for her own wedding! Uninviting the MOH and grooms sister over a party? Playing the victim? Expecting you to still allow the wedding on your property? His family is doing everything?? No way.
