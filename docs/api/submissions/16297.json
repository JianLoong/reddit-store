This was surprising because the fianc\u00e9 and I have always had some issues. We\u2019ll call the fianc\u00e9 B. I agreed without a second thought because it was for my brother. I\u2019ve helped planned color schemes, bought planners, been dress shopping, even did her makeup for their engagement pictures. All of the normal maid of honor duty\u2019s. No problem with any of this. \nThis is where the problems begin. I had planned a Bachelorette trip for B and she was really excited as far as I knew. A few days after I had book the airbnb and finished planning the trip B texted me asking if we could go with a cheaper route on the trip. I responded with okay i will cancel the trip I had planned. This apparently wasn\u2019t the reaction she had wanted so we did not speak for the next few weeks. I had still been speaking with my brother throughout this time and was waiting for him to get back form work (he works away from home) because I wanted to have a conversation with both of them about what happened with the trip. I had told this to the both of them. \nLast night I received this  text message \u201cBrother and B have been discussing some things. We can talk more about it when he gets home if you would like. We both think it would be best to put someone else as maid of honor. This will help limit issues with everyone.\u201d (Edited to remove names). I \nresponded with \u201ccool \ud83d\udc4d\u201d.  This set B off where she told me to lose my attitude towards her she was sick and tired of us walking all over her and that it had been going on for years that\u2019s why they decided to remove family from the wedding. I\u2019ll admit ITA. I asked if she wanted me to gravel at her feet for them to change the decision? i told her that it was my family that had been putting the whole wedding together not hers so her decision to remove family just meant my brothers not hers (Her family hadn\u2019t been involved). That the only way we had ever walk all over B was because she needs  to be the victim in every. single. situation. she had ever been in. I informed her that my brother would always be my brother but i had scraped better thing off the bottom of my shoe then her. Yes this was an asshole response and I know that but I was so fed up with her playing a victim when we had done everything in our power to make this special for her. I then got a text from my brother saying I was no longer allowed at his wedding, his home or his life that our relationship was done. I told him Okay that i loved him but didn\u2019t want a relationship with him if B was involved. I also told him my home was no longer available for his wedding. They were going to use the pasture for the \u201cvenue\u201d to decorate set up tent, dance floor etc. That was the last of it I blocked B number and social media.

As I understand it you cancelled the trip because B thought it was too expensive and then planned to meet and discuss it. If you would've just cancelled it and said the \"whole thing is off\" maybe the ruling would be different. B seems to be quite immature for getting so aggravated over you being fine with their decision. What did she want from you? For you to offer to pay for the expensive trip? To begg for the position back? Sad about you and your brother though.", "Based off what you have posted here you are definately NTA!\n\nBut I believe additional context is needed.\n\nWhat has your family been walking all over her about?  What does that mean?\n\nWhy hasn't her family been involved in the wedding planning?

She was being one first, and to me that means you don't have to hold back. She sounds exhausting to deal with, and her snapping at \"cool\"? I'd have torn into her too.", "NTA She started it instead of communicating her desires or needs with the bachelorette trip. Sounded like she was fishing to get her portion paid for. Your brother escalated it.", "Dumb move on the bride and groom\u2019s part if they were counting on your $$$ or your home.  Your response was a bit classless and dramatic but you have no obligation to finance the wedding of people who don\u2019t want you around otherwise.", "Nta You should\u2019ve let them think they could use Your location until the last minute then yank it away", "NTA, and the best revenge is to post a lot of pics of you laughing and enjoying your life.

She actually move in with us at 15. So i\u2019m guessing because my parents \u201cparented\u201d her like they did us it was walking all over her. I really don\u2019t understand her perspective on it at all so that\u2019s really all I can come up with.

I just knew she didn\u2019t want to go with the one i had planned.", "Same", "Well she's fucking stupid. That's not how these bachelorette parties happen. Also, I do think she wanted you to grovel and say \"oh no!! Please oh please let me be your maid of honor, or I cannot live with myself if I'm not!!\" And probably the reason why you were her Maid of Honor is because is she is unsufferable and has no friends that will put up with her shit. Hoenstly your better off, here's hoping your brothers next marriage is better.  \n\n\nEDITED; btw B is no way ready to be married. She has expectations but doesn't voice them. She needs to grow up and realize you are not a mind reader. If she wants something she needs to use her voice.", "Ok, but you said she asked for a cheaper route, what does that mean? Like, cheaper way to get there? Or was it bad wording on your part and she asked for a cheaper event overall?", "She never elaborated on what she meant by a cheaper trip. She just told me she wanted a cheaper trip. We were driving and I was going to pay for the gas so i don\u2019t think she meant that by it.", "I think OP means B wanted to make the overall event/trip cheaper.", "Ok I get you, thank you. I thought she just wanted to switch from like, a plane to a bus or something."]}
