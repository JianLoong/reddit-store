I am lucky to have a few grocery stores and restaurants across the street from my house and when I returned home, I found out she went ahead and invited over a \"friend of hers\" that  just so happened to live nearby my fianc\u00e9 and I, without making sure I was ok with it or without asking for permission. \n\nI wouldn't have cared if she invited a friend of hers over. However, she did not ask me or my Fianc\u00e9.

I then raised my voice out of frustration, because she continued to deny being in the wrong, and  then I told her that this is my home, and if she would like to go elsewhere, she may as she does not respect me or my home. Furthermore, I do not know this person that she invited over, and for her to come into my home without my permission while I am busy and working is not okay. My fianc\u00e9 was also upset, however, he said to just let it go, though I am not and still quite upset. \n\nAITA?\n\nhow I could be the AITA: She is a guest, and a family member of my fianc\u00e9.

There are so many things that she can do on her vacation.", "NTA\n\nAuntie has no manners.  Yes, it's her vacation and she can do what she wants.

Kick her out.", "NTA.\n\nThe aunt was a guest in your home, so she should have cleared bringing in other people ahead of time. That was a faux pas on her part. Insisting that she could do whatever she wanted in your home because it was her vacation is the act of an entitled AH.", "Need more info: were the two of them being disruptive in any way? Did you even give them a chance to hang out to see if they were peaceful in their activities? Or were you just irritated at the fact someone you didn\u2019t know was there without permission?\n\nBecause to me, it sounds like you were ready to fight as soon as you saw them. I can understand being a bit annoyed, but like, it\u2019s not a big deal. Unless your aunt is some kind of deviant who has dangerous acquaintances I don\u2019t see what the big deal is. Were they cutting lines of cocaine on the table? Planning a bank robbery? Or were they just two old friends catching up at a place your aunt thought she was welcome?\n\nI\u2019m leaning YTA.

First, your fianc\u00e9 should have approached her.

The fact that she waited until you had gone out and couldn't stop it is very telling.  Personally, I'd ask her to spend the rest of her vacation at a hotel.", "Based on what you\u2019ve presented ESH.\n\nIt\u2019s not that far outside the norm for a family member to invite a friend of theirs over for a couple hours while their host is busy - unless they were disruptive or you or fianc\u00e9 had previously established that guests were not welcome. \n\nYour reaction is over the top, making you an AH. You could have addressed this in any number of more reasonable ways or had your fianc\u00e9 do so. \n\nThe aunt\u2019s statement that she can do whatever she wants makes her an AH. A normal person would have apologized for violating the previously unknown household norm and for making their host uncomfortable. Then moving forward everyone would be aware that visits of this type need to be prearranged. \n\nIn the future, you should probably provide houseguests a hint that this is outside your comfort zone.  Or just chill out.", "NTA She can rent an Airbnb if she want to do as she want\nIt's not difficult to ask, and it could have be okay if she was sorry after you spoke to her, but aggravated??", "When I find an unknown intruder in my home, my first inclination isn't to be polite.  OP didn't blow this out of proportion.", "I'm with this response. Nice, respectable Auntie inviting a nice, respectable friend to hang out vs. sitting on the sofa by herself while you work? What's the matter with that? A good host makes everyone feel welcome. YTA", "HELL no. Op is definitely NTA -- Who just.. invites someone else into their host's home without telling the host? That's absolute bullshit, and if anyone did that to me I'd be fucking livid.", "\u201cUnknown intruder\u201d - this wasn\u2019t somebody who broke into her property. This was somebody who was enjoying pleasant company and had been invited.\n\nYou sound like somebody who\u2019d draw a gun on a the paperboy.", "Lol I bet you\u2019re the aunt in this story, because that\u2019s such an entitled and disrespectful take. If someone invites you into their home, that invite is for you and for you only. The homeowner isn\u2019t obligated to host anyone else, and it\u2019s definitely not up to the guest to decide who gets to come over or not without asking first.", "Clearly this is a matter of differing values. I come from a place where we\u2019re taught to make everybody welcome. Especially if they are family. I\u2019m guessing a lot of these responses are coming from particular citizens from the US where it\u2019s more common to shoot visitors than accept them. That\u2019s fine.

This is not something you let go.", "NAH\nShe has different boundaries and treated your house as her home. I don't blame you for being surprised and upset returning to get back to work and finding unexpected company. You were both upset when you talked about it.\nMaybe, when you're both calm, you can tell Auntie how it disturbed your feeling of peace and privacy to be surprised like that. She'll probably say she never thought having her friend over would be a problem. She was flustered and upset when you reacted and corrected her. \n\nYou can request prior notice, and approval, before she hosts friends at your house. If she can accept your feelings and your boundaries to protect them, all good.\n\nIf this is the first time it's happened, it's worth a calm conversation to build a bridge with mutual respect.", "\u201cPack your things and get out.\u201d", "ESH.

We haven't seen each other in ages.\" As you were out at the time, she could not ask you. \n\nA presumably respectable, older woman dropping in is not a huge deal.\n\nI do have a problem with your aunt saying, \"I am on vacation and I can do as I please.\" She should have simply said, \"Sorry, I didn't think you would mind.

We live in a popular beach town. We told people when we moved that if they wanted to visit, it was to see us and not to go on vacation. That included all in-laws of all types. We still have to work and do day to day stuff, even if they are on vacation. There is a short list of people we would allow to crash at our place while they were vacationing here. Those people we trust. Everyone else can get a hotel if they want to visit the area.", "All of this. \n\nAs an adult, even on vacation, she is able to do whatever she wants.
