Around 10 weeks into my pregnancy I suffered a miscarriage and then I returned home to find my husband in bed with my sister. The two of them tried to apologize and convince me that we could all get over it. But I wanted nothing to do with either of them and even less so when I found out she had gotten pregnant. My divorce was finalized quickly because I wanted nothing from him other than the divorce and was willing to leave the marriage with nothing but the clothes on my back. \n\nPretty early I realized my parents were hoping I would want to still be part of the baby's life but I wanted nothing to do with the baby my sister conceived while sleeping with my husband (now ex) as I lay in hospital losing my own pregnancy. I refused any and all contact with my sister and ex. They married and had two more children after the one she concieved during my marriage to him.\n\nI met my current husband when I had distanced myself from my whole family and he was amazing and his family were great. We got married two years ago and his family are nothing short of the best. I adore the nieces and nephews I have gained through my marriage to him and we spend a lot of time together.\n\nAround three months ago my sister called me at work (using my work phone) and told me she needed me and could I please come to her. I hung up the phone and continued about my day. It was several hours later that I got a message from my parents saying I needed to be with my sister. A few days later I got another call and was told my sister had been pregnant, the baby passed away inside of her and she delivered a stillborn all while he was out sleeping with someone else. My parents and sister expected me to rally around her and I didn't. Now that some time has passed and she lives with them, I have been inundated with them saying I should meet her kids, be there for them like I am my husband's nieces and nephews and that I should reconcile with the family. My sister told me how sorry she was again and that she wanted us to make up. I told the three of them that she and her kids are not my problem and I still want nothing to do with them.\n\nMy parents are furious and they say I need to forgive because whatever she did, she is now suffering worse than would ever be deserved and her kids are innocent and deserve an aunt.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670151305, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc6sf7/aita_for_telling_my_estranged_sister_and_our/", "score": 20005, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is one of the worst things a human can go through. My comment was more aimed at the cheating aspect, and the fact that the two situations are so damn similar.

And no one deserves to lose a child. But that has nothing to do with what she did to you. And yes, she absolutely did deserve the rest of what happened to her, that's just called karma. And your parents saying \"she's suffering worse than would ever be deserved\" is just bizarre to me because...It's EXACTLY what happened to you, except in your situation it was worse because it was your SISTER who did it.\n\nYour sister and your ex-husband are, of course, the biggest assholes here. But your parents aren't much better for trying to manipulate you. And I have a strong feeling it's out of pure selfishness that they want you back in your sister's life, most likely because they're a bit overwhelmed having both her and the children staying with them and want some help in some form or another.\n\nEither way, I'm so happy to hear that you found a great husband with an amazing family who has given you the support you both needed and deserved. Focus on them. Go low contact with your parents, and if they can't respect your boundaries then maybe no contact (at least for now).", "NTA.

Around 10 weeks into my pregnancy I suffered a miscarriage and then I returned home to find my husband in bed with my sister. The two of them tried to apologize and convince me that we could all get over it. But I wanted nothing to do with either of them and even less so when I found out she had gotten pregnant. My divorce was finalized quickly because I wanted nothing from him other than the divorce and was willing to leave the marriage with nothing but the clothes on my back. \n\nPretty early I realized my parents were hoping I would want to still be part of the baby's life but I wanted nothing to do with the baby my sister conceived while sleeping with my husband (now ex) as I lay in hospital losing my own pregnancy. I refused any and all contact with my sister and ex. They married and had two more children after the one she concieved during my marriage to him.\n\nI met my current husband when I had distanced myself from my whole family and he was amazing and his family were great. We got married two years ago and his family are nothing short of the best. I adore the nieces and nephews I have gained through my marriage to him and we spend a lot of time together.\n\nAround three months ago my sister called me at work (using my work phone) and told me she needed me and could I please come to her. I hung up the phone and continued about my day. It was several hours later that I got a message from my parents saying I needed to be with my sister. A few days later I got another call and was told my sister had been pregnant, the baby passed away inside of her and she delivered a stillborn all while he was out sleeping with someone else. My parents and sister expected me to rally around her and I didn't. Now that some time has passed and she lives with them, I have been inundated with them saying I should meet her kids, be there for them like I am my husband's nieces and nephews and that I should reconcile with the family. My sister told me how sorry she was again and that she wanted us to make up. I told the three of them that she and her kids are not my problem and I still want nothing to do with them.\n\nMy parents are furious and they say I need to forgive because whatever she did, she is now suffering worse than would ever be deserved and her kids are innocent and deserve an aunt.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she calls me and apologizes for the mom thing, acknowledges we never really had the best relationship and probably won't ever be super close but we can still be family... Yeah I think I could forgive her. But none of this \"you need to come see her, you need to talk to her\" bullshit. Its in her hands and on some level she knows or at least is vaguely aware of why I've stopped contact and even if she starts at that I can definitely fill in the gaps for her and see what comes next. \n\nI guess some people would call that being stubborn and probably not the best move since it'd be easier to just completely let go and never hold out any hope for it getting better. But thats where I've been, living my life perfectly fine with the idea in the back of my mind that maybe someday things can get better.", "I\u2019m sure she spends money on the nieces and nephews, too, and OP\u2019s parents want her to spend it on sister\u2019s kids.", "I am sure it is babysitting or taking the children for a while to give sister a break, I mean OP almost became mother to them so she will be a willing replacment mother, right?", "You read my mind!!", "[removed]", "She did not deserve a stillbirth.

It is disgusting and people doubling down to karma-splain that as replies are not making it look better.\n\nI also pointed out the sister has living children. OP was robbed of that. That is a secondary loss around child loss. Sister is compounding this by asking her to support *because* she has kids. Kids who just lost a sibling and had their daddy leave and their home break up. OP cannot be expected to support that depth of pain and she is right not to.\n\nThe living children make it an even bigger insult that the family are \u2018but faaamily\u2019 her now so the lack of compassion to how upsetting the nibling aspect of the retraumatising is while people act like Jerry Springer audience rejects about \u2018fucking her blood\u2019 is absolutely the nastiest most knitting round the guillotine thread I\u2019ve seen here. The OP was incredibly dignified how she wrote and the early responses were putrid.
