Around 10 weeks into my pregnancy I suffered a miscarriage and then I returned home to find my husband in bed with my sister. The two of them tried to apologize and convince me that we could all get over it. But I wanted nothing to do with either of them and even less so when I found out she had gotten pregnant. My divorce was finalized quickly because I wanted nothing from him other than the divorce and was willing to leave the marriage with nothing but the clothes on my back. \n\nPretty early I realized my parents were hoping I would want to still be part of the baby's life but I wanted nothing to do with the baby my sister conceived while sleeping with my husband (now ex) as I lay in hospital losing my own pregnancy. I refused any and all contact with my sister and ex. They married and had two more children after the one she concieved during my marriage to him.\n\nI met my current husband when I had distanced myself from my whole family and he was amazing and his family were great. We got married two years ago and his family are nothing short of the best. I adore the nieces and nephews I have gained through my marriage to him and we spend a lot of time together.\n\nAround three months ago my sister called me at work (using my work phone) and told me she needed me and could I please come to her. I hung up the phone and continued about my day. It was several hours later that I got a message from my parents saying I needed to be with my sister. A few days later I got another call and was told my sister had been pregnant, the baby passed away inside of her and she delivered a stillborn all while he was out sleeping with someone else. My parents and sister expected me to rally around her and I didn't. Now that some time has passed and she lives with them, I have been inundated with them saying I should meet her kids, be there for them like I am my husband's nieces and nephews and that I should reconcile with the family. My sister told me how sorry she was again and that she wanted us to make up. I told the three of them that she and her kids are not my problem and I still want nothing to do with them.\n\nMy parents are furious and they say I need to forgive because whatever she did, she is now suffering worse than would ever be deserved and her kids are innocent and deserve an aunt.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670151305, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc6sf7/aita_for_telling_my_estranged_sister_and_our/", "score": 653, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Around 10 weeks into my pregnancy I suffered a miscarriage and then I returned home to find my husband in bed with my sister. The two of them tried to apologize and convince me that we could all get over it. But I wanted nothing to do with either of them and even less so when I found out she had gotten pregnant. My divorce was finalized quickly because I wanted nothing from him other than the divorce and was willing to leave the marriage with nothing but the clothes on my back. \n\nPretty early I realized my parents were hoping I would want to still be part of the baby's life but I wanted nothing to do with the baby my sister conceived while sleeping with my husband (now ex) as I lay in hospital losing my own pregnancy. I refused any and all contact with my sister and ex. They married and had two more children after the one she concieved during my marriage to him.\n\nI met my current husband when I had distanced myself from my whole family and he was amazing and his family were great. We got married two years ago and his family are nothing short of the best. I adore the nieces and nephews I have gained through my marriage to him and we spend a lot of time together.\n\nAround three months ago my sister called me at work (using my work phone) and told me she needed me and could I please come to her. I hung up the phone and continued about my day. It was several hours later that I got a message from my parents saying I needed to be with my sister. A few days later I got another call and was told my sister had been pregnant, the baby passed away inside of her and she delivered a stillborn all while he was out sleeping with someone else. My parents and sister expected me to rally around her and I didn't. Now that some time has passed and she lives with them, I have been inundated with them saying I should meet her kids, be there for them like I am my husband's nieces and nephews and that I should reconcile with the family. My sister told me how sorry she was again and that she wanted us to make up. I told the three of them that she and her kids are not my problem and I still want nothing to do with them.\n\nMy parents are furious and they say I need to forgive because whatever she did, she is now suffering worse than would ever be deserved and her kids are innocent and deserve an aunt.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Smh", "Husband mart.....made me laugh", "She should definitely go NC with the parents if they continue to pressure her to have a relationship with her and her kids.", ">It always amazes me when someone begins a relationship by cheating with someone,\n\nBad enough if this is all it was.\n\nBut cheating with your sister's husband? When the sister is IN THE HOSPITAL due to a miscarriage?!!! Cheating in the said sister's home and bed??!! What kind of a person does that?!! It boggles the mind. The cheater sister deserves her karma!.  Sorry that sister had a still birth but why does she need OP? Does she want to hit on OP's new partner now that her cheater has cheated and left.  OP is NTA and should block all those numbers.", "My cousin got with her husband by him cheating on his then wife.  My cousin is always shocked and upset each and every time he cheated on her.  She would fuss about it on Facebook and I almost spit out my drink when her husband's ex chimed in and reminded my cousin that she got him by his cheating and kept losing him by it.  Cousin keeps thinking it's the women's fault and not her hobosexual husband that even tried his shot with my own mother.", "My grandmother always thought it was so great how my aunt and uncle always called each other to check in.. I don't think she understood that my uncle and aunt were together because he cheated with her on cousin's mom. and they were making sure the other wasn't cheating", "She will never know how her sister felt.  Her sister was betrayed by both husband & sister.  OP didn\u2019t sleep with her sisters husband.", "Having been there in college (trust me, I learned my lesson) yes that's exactly what I believed.", "And people also ignore that forgiving and forgetting are different things. Like I totally forgave the relatives that stole some family heirlooms to sell them. But not letting those relatives anywhere near my stuff again, no hard feelings, it's just basic logic.\n\nKinda same with sis here, OP can totally forgive and still don't want a relationship with them.", "My grandmother also said this, and it's so simple and true.", "Wow, that line is beautiful to the point of being poetic, it should be repeated more often", "Yup, NC is the way! And a nice dose of [Phucumol](https://youtu.be/6DqEOG5cWDw)", "THANK YOU! I was trying to think of the right way to word it, it\u2019s totally weird to me that they said the kids \u201cdeserve an aunt\u201d", "Seriously. If one of my sisters did this to me then I would end up on an episode of Snapped.", "Agreed.", "Too true. I should have said she now feels a fraction of what OP felt."]}
