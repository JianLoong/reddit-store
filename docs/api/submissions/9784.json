And so did my elderly mum. We put on our masks (almost no one else at the funeral was wearing one . . .

Unless you forgot to share some critical information that's not going to kill you. It wouldn't have much impact on your life overall at all. You would have to do a commute that you do all the time anyways? You do it 5 days a week. Again, no overall affect on your life.(As an aside, I've lived really not far outside NYC for most of my life... And especially based off the phrasing - that does not sound that bad at all. You'd be an AH regardless, but get a grip). You only met her grandmother once? Ok, cool. That's essentially irrelevant. You wouldn't have inherently been going for her grandmother you would have been going for your girlfriend. You've been together more than long enough for it to be a reasonable expectation.\n\nYour girlfriend just lost someone that presumably was a part of much of her life and in an overall positive way (I assume you'd have said if otherwise, given you're attempting to justify this blatant assholery). This is largely *your girlfriend's \"situation\"*. If I were in your place I would likely be beside myself thinking of the struggle my SO was going through and attempting to do whatever I could to be there for them. You prioritized some small amount of physical comfort over your girlfriend when you could have been actively helping her through an understandably difficult time.\n\nHell, my ex drove me to and supported me through my mother's funeral. And we were already broken up at the time for ~4 months, having not seen each other since (only phone calls and it was a very difficult breakup). I assume he did have to get up early too... Then my close friend who lived about a 12 hour flight away put her entire life on hold to come visit and support me ASAP. I didn't ask either of them, they just *cared*. Why are you even with this girl?\n\nThe fact that, assuming this is real, you have to even ask or think that your justifications make even the tiniest bit of sense to anyone that has the slightest semblance of ability to empathize with other humans is more telling than anything.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. Funerals are about the person that died, but they're *for* the living to grieve, reminisce, and find support. \n\nYour purpose was love sympathy compassion... support for the living. You failed that. Hard. Why? Because it's inconvenient?? Wow.", "Yes obviously YTA. Funerals are for the living. It\u2019s obvious your gf would\u2019ve liked you there for support.", "YTA\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter that you never met the grandmother, you were going to support your g/f.  \n\nBoo boo you have to wake up at 7:30am once in a while.  That\u2019s life. \n\nYou are 100% wrong here", "It's about being there for your GF, not her grandmother.  You are definitely the asshole.", "YTA on the grounds of being lazy and unsupportive.", "YTA. You going to the funeral has nothing to do with YOUR relationship to her grandmother, it's to do with your relationship to YOUR gf. She needed your support and you are so self centred that you couldn't see it.", "It was too early in the morning? Good lord. Yta and a pretty bad bf.", "YTA. Part of being in a relationship is being there for each other.", "YTA. Huge one. Hope she makes that break permanent", "Lolll welcome to being an adult. Sometimes as an adult, you have to do inconvenient things because you love someone and you want to support them and show them you care. With your choice, you have shown your gf that you don\u2019t care about her grief or her emotions, in what is probably a difficult time. YTA. Big time. \n\nI also can\u2019t stop laughing that you thought waking up around 6.30am is too early and leaving the house at 7.30am is too early. Lollll.", "YTA....yikes. I was prepared to hear you out (like maybe you had some trauma around funerals or something, and would have had a hard time going), but \"it's too early for me to get up\" is about as pathetic excuse as any.", "YTA. She should break up with you. You\u2019re an insensitive person who showed her that she would not be able to rely on you on her worst days. Not only that but the sheer audacity of even thinking that there\u2019s a possibility that you are right in this situation.", "Clearly YTA. Your girlfriend and everyone on Reddit understands why you didn\u2019t WANT to go. That \u201clogic\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have supported your gf when she had a death in the family. You\u2019re clearly a very uncaring partner.", "Yes YTA", "YTA. You should have gone to support her. You can\u2019t sacrifice one morning to support your partner who just lost her loved one? I hope for her sake that she realizes she deserves better and the \u201cbreak\u201d ends up being permanent. You don\u2019t sound ready for a serious relationship or frankly any relationship if you can\u2019t do the bare minimum when your partner really needs some compassion and support.", "Yta", "You will never be able to live this down with her family. If you had gone, they more than likely would have sung your praises for making the effort to get up early and take a long train to be there to support their daughter/loved one. But now you\u2019re just the dolt who couldn\u2019t be bothered to do the bare minimum when she needed you the most.", "Oh no, not 730am! Why that is just cruel and unusual punishment! \n\nYTA. Seriously. YTA. Her grandmother died and she would\u2019ve liked to have someone hold her hand or rub her back or offer her tissues but not you. Oh no. You can\u2019t possibly wake up at 730am to acknowledge her loss or support her. That is just asking too much. \n\nLet me explain something to you and I\u2019ll use small words to help. It isn\u2019t just the funeral. She needed you and you decided sleep was more important. What happens when her car breaks down in the middle of the night? You will pick sleep. What happens if someone breaks into her home in the middle of the night? You will pick sleep. What happens if she has a health emergency? You will pick sleep. \n\nYou broke her faith in you. You showed that you do not care about her. You showed her that she is nothing to you. She cannot rely on you for the big things so you will definitely not show up for the little things. You\u2019re selfish and petulant. You need to realize that other people have value and worth. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and her world will not contain you again, if she is smart with this break.", "You know the \"break\" is permanent, right? YTA", "YTA. You had one job as a boyfriend- to be supportive and there. You failed on both accounts. You told her that supporting her on one of the hardest days of her life during a rare occurrence matters less to you than sleeping longer. You also told her that you don\u2019t respect her grandmother or the relationship they had. \n\nWhen my grandmother passed (the first person I ever lost) my ex-boyfriend (who I was dating for a similar length of time when it happened) went to the funeral home in Brooklyn (sure he lived there too but it was a completely different neighborhood), drove to the cemetery in like Jersey, and then went to the repast in Far Rockaway before driving back to Brooklyn. \n\nHe also only met her like once, but he put that all aside because it was important to me and he cared about me. Of course my family also loved him for that. You have ensured that your girlfriend won\u2019t trust you to have her back or be a true partner. You also made sure that even if she were to forgive you that her family would wish she didn\u2019t and never truly accept you.", "i genuinely can\u2019t understand the logic and lack of compassion you have for your girlfriend during this time. whether you knew her grandma well or not, it isn\u2019t about that. it\u2019s about showing your girlfriend the love you have for her and how you can emotionally and physically help her during this time.\n\nshe has everyyyyyyyyyy right to dump you because this just goes to show whenever she needs your comfort and support, she\u2019ll never get it from you because you\u2019ll make some lame ass excuse like you have to walk your fish or something.\n\nyou\u2019re about to get a lot of sleep once she breaks up with you.", " YTA. Hopefully, she will smarten up & drop you.", "You're too lazy to get up and support your gf? Guess you're too lazy to have a girlfriend at all.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if you knew her grandma well enough. Your girlfriend loved her and she asked you to go, so you go to support HER. \n\nAnd too early on the morning? Actual, adult relationships sometimes require waking up early in the morning. 95% of an successful relationship is showing up and supporting your partner.", "YTA, you've shown her that you won't be there to support her when needed. At least she found out before the relationship became more serious", "YTA- You'd be going for your gf, not the grandma.  Gf is mature for 18, she saw thru your BS and took a step back from the relationship. Good for her! You should've gone though.", "YTA I have a feeling that you\u2019ll soon be able to sleep as late as you want\u2014alone\u2014after offering these ridiculous excuses for not supporting your gf during this sad time. I have to question if you care about your gf at all and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s come to a similar conclusion. That\u2019s why she is taking a break from you. You sound exhausting and extremely selfish.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not a case of not understanding your situation. Your girlfriend understands you perfectly. You are selfish. She is grieving and you couldn\u2019t be bothered to get up early and travel for an hour to go to the funeral. You may have only met the grandmother once, but you have (presumably) met your girlfriend more than once. And you (presumably) claim to at least like her. You don\u2019t go to funerals at a time like this to honour the dead, you go to support the living. You know, your girlfriend.\n\nThe only good thing is that now she is fully aware of how selfish you are, so she can dump you.", "YTA, super shitty thing to do, hope she doesn\u2019t plan on having a future with you.\n\nWow dude. You\u2019re there for HER, not her grandmother.", "YTA. Funerals are for the living. You're not going because of the grandma you didn't know, but to support and comfort your girlfriend who loved her.", "YTA and as an extremely selfish person, there\u2019s a high chance you will be single soon. She\u2019ll start thinking about her future with you and what that would be like.", "Yta. No explanation needed. You should know yta.", "YTA and i wouldn\u2019t call her your girlfriend anymore because if she has any intelligence at all she\u2019s already moved on", "YTA. \n\nPretty selfish of you to not support someone you \u201ccare about \u201c because \u201cI only met her grandmother once\u201d. Being in a relationship means you support each other. Your sleep seemed more important to you. \n\nYou\u2019re sounding selfish and entitled. I hope she breaks up with you honestly. You don\u2019t seem to want to put any effort into the relationship anyway. \n\nEmpathy and support are important in a relationship. I\u2019m surprised you weren\u2019t taught that by whoever raised you.", "This!", "Exactly this!  Funerals aren't for the dead, they are for the people who loved them and are mourning their loss. \n\n\n When my husband and I had been dating for less than a year, his grandmother, who I had met 2x passed.  I accompanied him to the hospital before she passed and was by his side during the funeral.  I didn't have a relationship with this woman, but my DH did, and I was able to be there for HIM.\n\nYTA", "Yeah, bet you 10 months ago, she was a minor", "He's not in a relationship anymore...", "He can only hope she's nicer than me. I'd never give him another chance. I'd act like he never existed to me because clearly, her loss and need for support don't exist and are not a priority. Pure selfishness. I'm still in disbelief that someone could really be so dense.", "And even if she forgives him, her family members will never look at him the same way again.", "Well she\u2019s 18, so definitely in the last 12 months\u2026\n\n\nETA: Oh dang, I\u2019m an idiot. I didn\u2019t get your point until just now.", "I'm with you on that"]}
