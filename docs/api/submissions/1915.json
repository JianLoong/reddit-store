This was devastating for the whole family, obviously especially my mum, and as the eldest child I had to pick up the slack and hold things together. It\u2019s a role I\u2019m still having to do to this day, and honestly I really resent the position I was put in whilst my dad rode off into the sunset with his new partner. \n\nMy dad and my relationship took an immediate nose dive and I instantly lost the close relationship I had with him. Things have been very strained over the past ten years, and there have even been times of no contact due to our inability to see one another\u2019s point of view. He is dismayed at my refusal to accept his partner (with whom he had the affair) and I am upset that he continues to try to force me into a relationship with her. I have made it quite clear to him that I only wish to have a relationship with him and him only, and I will never want to have a relationship with her. \n\nI have children now and he continues to try and encourage me to have a relationship with his partner, and even has gone as far as to suggest that I should allow him unsupervised contact with my children and he and his partner. This is unfathomable to me, as I barely have a relationship with him, let alone his partner (although I acknowledge that this is not for his lack of trying). However, I am also aware that it is perhaps not normal or healthy to hold a decade long grudge, but I am truly not sure I will ever be ready to accept her.

That's a difficult action to \"get over.\"\n\nYou do what feels best for you.  It's fine if you want to build a relationship and it's fine if you don't.  You will move past it when & if you are ready.  He doesn't get to dictate when or if that will be.", "NTA\n\nYou are under no obligation to have a relationship with his affair partner.", "NTA. It's not a grudge, it's a boundary that he seems hellbent on trampling on. Stand your ground.", "NTA.  My dad's father had an affair and married his affair partner.  He had six kids, including my dad, and at the time of the divorce they ranged from the ages of 3 to 15.  My grandmother never spoke badly about them but all my dad's siblings cut off contact with my grandfather when they were old enough.  My dad chose to try and maintain a relationship.  Everyone is allowed to feel how they feel and none of my aunt's or uncles have regrets, even after my grandfather passed.  You do what's best for you, not for your dad.", "NTA.   \nIt does not sound like you are holding a grudge - but you have a lasting impact, that your father caused, and he has not truly acknowledged. The course of your childhood changed when he made his choices. \n\nYour father has not respected the boundaries you have put in place. He is making your relationship a package deal with his partner, someone that you feel resentment towards and are not interested in gaining a relationship with. Your father needs to understand that his actions have last consequences and you have no respect for the affair partner or a parent who continually puts their needs first. \n\nThe next time you he pushes, you can inform him that he made his choices without regard for you, and you are making your choices in the best interest of you and your family. You do not respect either of them for their lack of understanding, or boundaries, and you will not allow that to follow to your children.", "NTA\n\nIf you don\u2019t wanna connect then you don\u2019t have to. At this point it might even be easier to go NC", "It would be different if he had remorse and was begging for your forgiveness.  However, it sounds like he is trying to force you to accept the life he chose over you and your mom and dismissing the carnage left in its wake.  Because of that, you don't owe him anything.  NTA", "NTA, this is the risk he ran when he started an affair before ending his marriage.  He doesn't get to dictate your feelings or steamroll your boundaries.  If you want to work on accepting all this, you could ask him to do some counseling with you.", "NTA. On the one hand, I do believe that people are complex and can be horrible partners yet good parents, but a good parent respects the boundaries of their children. Your father knows that he harmed you and put you in an unfair position at a young age, and should respect the fact that while you are willing to see him, you do not want to see his partner. It is okay to have this as a boundary, and while you're free to change it at anytime, he needs to accept this as a fixed position right now and work on rebuilding your trust. Wishing you the best as you work through this.", "NTA.  It's completely normal to still be angry after years.  He didn't just cheat and abandon his wife, he cheated and left his family and that's you.  He has to live with the consequences of his actions.  And if that includes after little to no relationship with you and your family, that's totally on him.", "NTA - IMO you don't ever have to accept her. I'm just gonna guess that she knew your dad was married? Yet still had an affair with him? So she is a home wrecker? \nEven if she didn't know at first, eventually it had to come out that he was married. Soooooo, yeah I wouldn't want a relationship with someone who ruined my family.\n\nThey both Destroyed a whole family for their own selfish reasons. Then you had to pick up the slack.\nThat is unfair to you. I do suggest some some therapy to help unpack this though. TBH my dad did the same thing to my mom and we'll his first wife. Wife #3 seems to be doing well so far.\n\nAlso you don't need to leave your kids with him unsupervised, especially when you don't have a good relationship with him. All he is going to do is introduce them to his partner, who you don't want anything to do with. Probably try to use that against you. It will only add fuel to the fire.", "*Dad, when you bailed on mom, I had to pick up your slack and take over your responsibilities.  It became MY job to hold the family together.  So let me make myself clear.  I blame you and your partner for stealing the life I was supposed to have from me.  I resent the both of you for what you did to my family and I resent that she had an affair with a married man and destroyed his family in the process.*\n\n*I will never do to my kids what you did to me and I will not allow you to break their hearts like you broke mine.  And while I am willing to swallow my pride because you are my father and I still have some kind of connection to you, at no point will I ever have anything to do with your partner.  Not now.  Not ever.  This is not me holding a grudge.  This is me holding the both of you accountable for your actions and the devastation you left when you made them.*\n\n*You need to either accept that you and you alone can be in my life and completely on my terms...or you just need to walk away and abandon me again.  But I am done having this discussion with you.*\n\n*This is a take it or leave it offer.  Accept my terms or get the hell out of my life for good.  The choice is yours.*\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is perfectly normal. What isn't normal is abandoning your family for someone else then trying to force that person on the people you abandoned. Just because he wants something doesn't mean he's entitled to it or deserves it. Don't even consider giving him unsupervised contact.", "NTA\n\nYour dads affair ruined the family & what ever relationship you had with him. You had to be your moms support while he got to move on! His actions has consequences & this is it.", "NAH. Your reaction, and your father's attempt at a fuller more complete reconciliation are understandable and normal human reactions to an awful situation. One that you had zero ability to control, had devastating consequences for you, and forced you into a parenting role.  But time moves on. Allowing your father and his partner into the lives of your children could be beneficial to them. I grew up in the sixties with three sets of grandparents which to my mercenary little toddler heart meant I got more presents at Christmas and birthdays than folks who only had two, so I was glad of the circumstances. Remember that when you forgive someone, especially when they dont deserve it, it benefits you as much, sometimes more. So try very hard to find it in yourself to give Dad and his wife another chance. I think in the end you will be glad that you did. And if you just can't, you just can't, which doesnt make you a bad person either. My best to you and all of your family.", "NTA. However while boundaries are good and necessary, you are going to have to make a decision in one way or another. Accept your father as he is, or don't. While you don't want to include his SO, he has decided that she is who he wants to spend his life with, at least for now. It's more than likely that the ultimatum will come as her or you, unless you find a way to coexist.", "Your dad caused you a lot of hurt and his partner is always gonna be a reminder of that.  You tried to compromise that you can mend your relationship with him but he will not till you accept his partner.  \n\nMy suggest would be a family therapy session to have a non involved mediator between you and your dad.  If not I think you should write a letter and get all your feelings out and expressed to him the hurt he caused you.  \n\nYou can only move on when you are ready.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your father has a life and often times marriages are not meant to be. It\u2019s time to put away your grudge and recognize that he has a right to be happy in his relationship. If you had to pick up the prices of your moms devastation, that\u2019s on your mom for leaning on a child for moral support rather than her friends. That should never be the role of a child.", "NTA, but I think you should consider talking to a therapist to work through your feelings. It\u2019s understandable that you were resentful when you were a child during that situation, but you\u2019re an adult now and you should look on it with new eyes. Process that resentment and let it go. Your father betrayed your mother, not you. You don\u2019t need to carry that pain/anger for her, too. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that your dad didn\u2019t make you have more responsibility-your mom did. You mother never should  required that you \u201cpick up the slack,\u201d or \u201chold things together.\u201d You could easily resent your mom for the same things you resent your father for.

If OP wants one then good, if not then that's good too. OP is entitled to feel however she feels about the situation.", ">It would be different if he had remorse and was begging for your forgiveness.\n\nExactly. He sounds like one of those people who tries to force other people to accept their mistakes so they don't have to deal with the guilt.", "It's also not okay that a father leave all his kids for a mother to raise because he decided he wants run off with a new honey pot to poke in. So you think it's okay that the father abandoned his children? \n\nAnd while she might have had to be there for moral support she didn't explicitly say that here. It reads \" had to pick up the slack\", which probably means that OP had to take on a parenting like role because there were younger kids and her mother needed help because she couldn't work/provide for the family and be there all the time as well.", ">often times marriages are not meant to be\n\nThis is definitely true, but the right thing to do is to end your marriage before you start sleeping with someone else.", "He can be happy in his relationship. However, he shouldn't try to make OP have a relationship with the person who ruined her home life. He hasn't listened to OP because presumably he feels that he should be able to have things however he wants them.", "And no one talks about the fact he betrayed OPs mom by cheating. Who would be friendly with someone who betrayed their mom? \n\nCheating damages more than just the couple\u2019s relationship.", "I can agree with that.
