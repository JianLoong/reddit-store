If you want to work on accepting all this, you could ask him to do some counseling with you.", "NTA. On the one hand, I do believe that people are complex and can be horrible partners yet good parents, but a good parent respects the boundaries of their children. Your father knows that he harmed you and put you in an unfair position at a young age, and should respect the fact that while you are willing to see him, you do not want to see his partner. It is okay to have this as a boundary, and while you're free to change it at anytime, he needs to accept this as a fixed position right now and work on rebuilding your trust. Wishing you the best as you work through this.", "NTA.  It's completely normal to still be angry after years.

Then you had to pick up the slack.\nThat is unfair to you. I do suggest some some therapy to help unpack this though. TBH my dad did the same thing to my mom and we'll his first wife. Wife #3 seems to be doing well so far.\n\nAlso you don't need to leave your kids with him unsupervised, especially when you don't have a good relationship with him.

His actions has consequences & this is it.", "NAH. Your reaction, and your father's attempt at a fuller more complete reconciliation are understandable and normal human reactions to an awful situation. One that you had zero ability to control, had devastating consequences for you, and forced you into a parenting role.  But time moves on. Allowing your father and his partner into the lives of your children could be beneficial to them. I grew up in the sixties with three sets of grandparents which to my mercenary little toddler heart meant I got more presents at Christmas and birthdays than folks who only had two, so I was glad of the circumstances. Remember that when you forgive someone, especially when they dont deserve it, it benefits you as much, sometimes more. So try very hard to find it in yourself to give Dad and his wife another chance. I think in the end you will be glad that you did. And if you just can't, you just can't, which doesnt make you a bad person either. My best to you and all of your family.", "NTA. However while boundaries are good and necessary, you are going to have to make a decision in one way or another. Accept your father as he is, or don't. While you don't want to include his SO, he has decided that she is who he wants to spend his life with, at least for now. It's more than likely that the ultimatum will come as her or you, unless you find a way to coexist.", "Your dad caused you a lot of hurt and his partner is always gonna be a reminder of that.  You tried to compromise that you can mend your relationship with him but he will not till you accept his partner.  \n\nMy suggest would be a family therapy session to have a non involved mediator between you and your dad.

My dad unleashed the affair bomb on our family midway through my pregnancy with our first child. He took no responsibility for the hurt he caused, yet expected me to accept the situation and his new partner without issue. Neither he nor his girlfriend really took ownership over the stress and emotional weight that was unexpectedly put on my shoulders during the pregnancy, yet they both expected full access to my children. I'm also the oldest and felt the need to carry the unnecessary responsibility of trying to keep my family together. I've slowly, but surely been working through that tendency with my therapist. My husband and I agreed to revisit the issue at the five year mark (we didn't think they'd make it that long). To our surprise, they did. We reevaluated and still felt confident in our decision to limit contact with my dad and to continue not having a relationship with his girlfriend. My brother, the very agreeable and welcoming one of the family, has run into numerous issues with my dad's girlfriend. If he can't have a calm relationship with the two of them together, then I most certainly don't want to introduce that drama and stress into the lives of my children. It sucks and it makes me sad. I miss my dad, but I have to take care of my own little family unit. I still mourn who I expected my Dad to be as a grandfather and the fact that his actions have caused my mom to have less time for being present with us, but I'm coming to terms with our reality. Take your time. Protect your own heart, mental well-being, and the well-being of your little family unit. Boundaries are healthy. Hopefully your dad will one day see more clearly the ways in which his actions harmed you. If he doesn't, at least you know you did your best to thoughtfully navigate the situation. These scenarios are the worst. I'm sorry you've also had to walk this path.\n\nEdited: to fix a few things and to also say thank you for posting this. It's hard to explain to people outside of the situation and I often feel lonely -- like people think I'm petty and unreasonable.
