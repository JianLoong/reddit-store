On the one hand, I do believe that people are complex and can be horrible partners yet good parents, but a good parent respects the boundaries of their children. Your father knows that he harmed you and put you in an unfair position at a young age, and should respect the fact that while you are willing to see him, you do not want to see his partner. It is okay to have this as a boundary, and while you're free to change it at anytime, he needs to accept this as a fixed position right now and work on rebuilding your trust.

Your reaction, and your father's attempt at a fuller more complete reconciliation are understandable and normal human reactions to an awful situation. One that you had zero ability to control, had devastating consequences for you, and forced you into a parenting role.  But time moves on. Allowing your father and his partner into the lives of your children could be beneficial to them. I grew up in the sixties with three sets of grandparents which to my mercenary little toddler heart meant I got more presents at Christmas and birthdays than folks who only had two, so I was glad of the circumstances. Remember that when you forgive someone, especially when they dont deserve it, it benefits you as much, sometimes more. So try very hard to find it in yourself to give Dad and his wife another chance. I think in the end you will be glad that you did. And if you just can't, you just can't, which doesnt make you a bad person either. My best to you and all of your family.", "NTA. However while boundaries are good and necessary, you are going to have to make a decision in one way or another. Accept your father as he is, or don't.

It's more than likely that the ultimatum will come as her or you, unless you find a way to coexist.", "Your dad caused you a lot of hurt and his partner is always gonna be a reminder of that.  You tried to compromise that you can mend your relationship with him but he will not till you accept his partner.  \n\nMy suggest would be a family therapy session to have a non involved mediator between you and your dad.

My dad unleashed the affair bomb on our family midway through my pregnancy with our first child. He took no responsibility for the hurt he caused, yet expected me to accept the situation and his new partner without issue. Neither he nor his girlfriend really took ownership over the stress and emotional weight that was unexpectedly put on my shoulders during the pregnancy, yet they both expected full access to my children. I'm also the oldest and felt the need to carry the unnecessary responsibility of trying to keep my family together. I've slowly, but surely been working through that tendency with my therapist. My husband and I agreed to revisit the issue at the five year mark (we didn't think they'd make it that long). To our surprise, they did. We reevaluated and still felt confident in our decision to limit contact with my dad and to continue not having a relationship with his girlfriend. My brother, the very agreeable and welcoming one of the family, has run into numerous issues with my dad's girlfriend. If he can't have a calm relationship with the two of them together, then I most certainly don't want to introduce that drama and stress into the lives of my children. It sucks and it makes me sad. I miss my dad, but I have to take care of my own little family unit. I still mourn who I expected my Dad to be as a grandfather and the fact that his actions have caused my mom to have less time for being present with us, but I'm coming to terms with our reality. Take your time. Protect your own heart, mental well-being, and the well-being of your little family unit. Boundaries are healthy. Hopefully your dad will one day see more clearly the ways in which his actions harmed you. If he doesn't, at least you know you did your best to thoughtfully navigate the situation. These scenarios are the worst. I'm sorry you've also had to walk this path.\n\nEdited: to fix a few things and to also say thank you for posting this. It's hard to explain to people outside of the situation and I often feel lonely -- like people think I'm petty and unreasonable.

But our relationship will never be the same again, and I don't want anything to do with the woman you cheated with.  She destroyed my family.  I don't want to talk about this with you any more, if you need to talk about it, please see a therapist.  And stop asking me to form a relationship with your partner, it's not going to happen.  If you continue to persist, our contact will go lower and lower, and perhaps our relationship will eventually dissolve as well.  End of discussion.\"  Then refuse to engage.  That's the really important part:  refuse to engage.  Your dad can't argue with someone who won't have an argument with him, it takes two.  You have every right to hate this woman and not ever want to get to know her, so just spell it out for him using small words that even a child could understand.", "> I am also aware that it is perhaps not normal or healthy to hold a decade long grudge, \n\nNTA We all need to stop this pervasive societal norm that is the nonsense of forgiveness. It\u2019s great if forgiveness or letting go of a grudge works  for an individual, but let others feel how they feel, for goodness sake! \n\nOP, maybe your dad apologized to you and you didn\u2019t mention it. It doesn\u2019t matter. Because if he was truly acknowledging the burden of his affair on you in particular he wouldn\u2019t be pushing a relationship with his (now out in the open) partner. Lasting consequences occur and not meaning for them to do so doesn\u2019t lessen the impact. \n\nHe chose to have an affair. He doesn\u2019t also get the choice for you to accept his partner or be unfair. It is your choice. And you finally get to decide who will be in or out of your life.", "I didn\u2019t speak to my father for almost thirty years. He sounds a lot like your father.

If he continues to push boundaries I'd go no contact again if I were you.", "NTA.\n\nIt hits a bit too close to home for me to elaborate any further so no other justifications. You are not the ahole. You, and only you, get to choose if, or when, you want to move forward or establish anything more. That type of betrayal is deep and personal.", "NTA\n\nWe can't help our feelings and you aren't wrong for having them.", "nta. he didn\u2019t cheat on your mom, he betrayed your family & uprooted your life. that has lasting consequences for you. so he , the perpetrator, can deal with some consequences too", "It\u2019s not a grudge.

He doesn\u2019t get to wreck everything and then expect acceptance after some time has passed.", "NTA. \n\nYour dad hurt not only you but destroyed your family. I wouldn't want that woman near me either, let alone my children. As far as the grudge goes you need to let it go for your own mental health and sanity, so you can get to a place of peace but still not let her around you or the kids.", "NTA\n\nYou can forgive but you don\u2019t have to forget. It sounds like this man broke your trust in him (along with many other things) and there\u2019s no time frame or deadline by when that trust can / should be regained. Take your time OP, and if you don\u2019t want your kids to see him, prioritize your kids.", "It is funny when people ask you \"get over this hurt I caused you, and which I never truly atoned for so I don't suffer because I can't get over it\". Which is basically what he is saying.\n\nHe walked away on you, not just your mom. He at the time could have chosen to prioritize his children, instead he chose himself. He could have divorced and still take care of you guys, if your mom wasn't able because the whole thing hit her hard, he could have taken the slack until she felt better. Instead he said \"I will leave my best life, see you!\" And he dumped everything on his ex wife, which in turn wasn't able to hold everything together and a lot of the responsibility spilled out to you.\n\nYou don't owe him anything. 0, nada. He decided to have children and when things didn't suit him, he dumped them. Even if he paid child support if he didn't actually take at least 50% of the effort he just dumped you. It was his responsibility that he didn't want.\n\nNow he is older and might feel a bit guilty or wants to play grandad and wants to force you to accept him. Has he done any real soul-searching to show he understands how much he messed up? I bet he didn't. He wants you to give him some slack, I say he got enough slack already when he didn't raise his kids. He can't have the cake and eat it. And BTW if the only reason you have a relationship with him is because he is your father, well you don't have too, he dumped you, he is really not too much of a father. If you are happier not dealing with him just go NC. If you want to maybe give it a try, make it clear he has has already enough slack, that if hurts him, tough luck, you have a right to chose who you associate with and he should be thankful he is in that list.\n\nNTA. You are not really holding a grudge as much as a limit and it makes you feel angry because he is trying to trampled over your limits and boundaries. Prioritizing what he wants over what you need and want, sound familiar? He never changed.", "Honestly, you are a bigger person than I am for willing to work in your relationship with you father, I don\u2019t think I could.  In regards to the mistress, you own her nothing, keep in mind this is a person without principles, you don\u2019t want that kind of people near your child.  Strong NTA", "NTA Don't leave them alone with your children. People like that do not deserve your trust at all.", "NTA - you have not obligation to forgive, forget or accept his partner. Him leaving meant you had to take on responsibilities that you wouldn't/shouldn't have. \n\nI think part of why you're still upset is that he hasn't acknowledged the impact on your childhood his actions had. If you are interested in a relationship with him I'd talk with him, preferably face to face, and start here. \n\nAs for me, I'd focus on your own family and stop playing his games.", "NTA imo", "Legitimately crying.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "This.

It's not a grudge...it's consequences", "plus if OP \"forgives\" then the affair wasn\u00b4t that bad, it\u00b4s in the past, dad has nothing to feel bad about", "So this happened with my husband and his mother. However I grew up without grandparents and I have seen how much love grandparents have for grandkids even when they themselves were horrible parents. I have seen these relationships with my friends and even my husband tells me stories about how amazing his grandparents were in his life. This always makes me sad that I never got the opportunity to know my grandparents. So I talked to my husband and I asked him if he was ok if I reached out to his mother and he partner (the person she ran off with over decade ago). To give our kids the opportunity to know all their grandparents, an opportunity I never had. He reluctantly agreed as long as he doesn\u2019t have to be involved in anyway. It started off with him never going over when I would with the kids. To now 5 years later he will visit on holidays only but doesn\u2019t talk much, I never force him to go or even ask. I just tell him I am going if he\u2019s ok with that and he usually tells me if he wants to come or just drop us off. My kids love all their grandparents and I can\u2019t imagine life if they didn\u2019t. So if it\u2019s possible maybe see if your partner can supervise these visits but tell him straight up you are not interested. Just someone who didn\u2019t have grandparents but really wish she did. I mean how was your grandparents? Were you close with any of them? How would you feel if your parents never gave you the opportunity to know them. Just my thought.", "NTA\n\nWhile yes 10 years is along time to hold a grudge and I do think talking to a therapist would help, You have every right to feel the way you do and to set boundaries.\n\nYour dad and his AP can either suck it up and act mature by not crossing your boundaries and allowing you to do what's best for you and your kids or they can just deal with you going NC with them", "NTA... he changed your life forever when he walked away. The pain might not be fresh but it is remembered.  This is his outcome, you decide how much power he has in your life. Do you trust him not to abandon your children?", "Parental abandonment is something that will mess you up for life. You are not holding a grudge, you don't trust him for strong reasons. It sounds like he has taken zero accountability and pushes to get his way. Reminds me of my dad and his revisionist history. Maybe just block contact with him. NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly OP i'd consider just cutting the cord and going NC, he clearly values his partner over you. \n\n\nFurthermore what role does he expect her to play in you and your kid's lives? Stepmom/Stepgrandma?", "Nta keep boundaries no un supervised visits an he must come alone.", "Nta - he has proven to not be a moral Upstanding person and it makes sense that you don\u2019t want that around your kids.", "NTA\n\nYour father couldn\u2019t even protect, raise and look after you and your siblings. What makes him think he can do the same for your grandchildren. His partner had no concern for your well-being when she was fucking him so why would you think she could be trusted with another child\u2019s emotional well being?", "NTA!!!! Nobody is ever an AH when it comes to coping with a parent's affair partner. \n\nMy mother had a 29-yr affair with a distant relative's husband. It ended when he died, in 1988. My father grimly plowed on being a living and dutiful husband. Nothing in my own life has affected me as much as this affair. It still has repercussions; last year I was very pointedly not invited to a funeral of someone dear to me, because of this history.", "Nta", "NTA \n\nYou have right to feel what you are feeling.\n\nYour father broke your family and impacted your life negatively. No one should force you to forgive him before you are ready (IF you are ready).", "Why is a grudge bad to have? Did you dad tell you that? Sounds like something he'd say to make you stop inconveniencing his pibedream in which everybody get along, so he can feel less guilty about his choices.", "NTA. What has HE done to repair your relationship and make right the hurt that he caused?", "It's really up to you where you place your boundaries. \n\nHe should be happy that you are still willing to have a relationship with him, he really is not in the position to ask for more.", "I hold grudges for life!! He\u2019s reaping the consequences of his actions and he forever will! If I was the home wrecker I wouldn\u2019t fancy meeting his kids that hate me and him. So I wonder if this is all him trying to put a puzzle together if so he has all the wrong pieces. Furthermore NTA.", "We don't know what dad's relationship with mom was before said affair.  Happy men don't stray and it's not any woman's job to keep a man faithful.  It's not anyone's fault when someone cheats except the couple involved.  It takes two to tangle and two to untangle.  I've seen spouses drive the other away with....pick a reason.  Grow from your experience.  Bitterness serves no master.", "Agree to the NTA part. But only suggestion for OP is that drawing this boundary should not have to be mental toil to you because more than the dad's partner, OP is hurting themselves. If need be go for NC because you don't deserve to be continuously pestered for this.", "They both sound stubborn as hell tho. Both stances are fine but at that point there is nothing left to discuss and just go your separate ways.", "I wish I could upvote this 10,000 times...this is perfect; OP say this to him, verbatim, or email it to him, it is literally the perfect statement.", "Holy frack I hope OP uses this!", "I dunno the first part doesn\u2019t land right for me. If OP was parentified that\u2019s actually on the mom not the dad. OP should not have had to pick up the slack, yes. And the dad shouldn\u2019t have had the affair, yes-  but the mom also shouldn\u2019t have put the burden of the divorce on the kids. OP should be blaming the mom for stealing the life they feel they should have had.", "I can\u2019t believe no one else is picking up on this - if OP was parentified that was hugely his mom\u2019s fault too!", "There is an AH though.
