You were honest without being insulting, and you got him to stop berating you.  Most important, you were able to finish the transaction and get him out of the store.  \n\nYour manager sounds like this is his first job.

Your manager just doesn't want to deal with it either", "NTA\n\nI feared the worst when you said \"snarky\" but you handled it like a pro.  Heck that's how my bosses would have us respond to those who are mean (which happens all the time).  How would your boss have handled it?  LET yourself be verbally abused?  No, that's not healthy for work and it only lets those people think they can get away with this behavior.", "ESH. Obviously he was being terribly rude. But there are more customer service appropriate ways to deal with this than calling him out. It sucks, but sometimes you need to bite your tongue with rude customers. I usually recommend the tried and true method of just getting non-responsive except for some \"mhms\" and the job scripts.", "ESH. The customer for being rude to service workers. Your manager for not having your back. But also, I\u2019m sorry but when you work a customer facing job, you\u2019re gonna need to suck it up, or at least release the tension somewhere else that\u2019s not in front of the customer.

WTH is wrong with the manager?! They are rewarding someone lying?", "I agree with you one hundred percent . The Customers is NOT always right.", "It doesn't have to be. I worked in service-side jobs for my teens and most of my twenties, you can absolutely set expectations like this and most supervisors worth their salt will back you up to the hilt. Having customers rail against your staff is a great way to lower the prestige of your brand, and will ultimately hurt sales and brand goodwill in the long term. Most other customers in line will also, generally, appreciate the pushback against assholes.\n\nDoes that mean a lot of mass market store supervisors with bad training will be jerks just because its what they went through? Of course. But any brand management team and corporate trainer will push for employees to firmly assert normalized manners in this way. It's the sign of a solid employee who can not only manage difficult customers while making a sale, but also managing store prestige.", "It really shouldn't be tho. It's not hard to be nice to people, especially ones just doing their job.", "Sure, but as OP tells it they were polite but firm. They did not insult the customer or yell or even snap at them. It's OK to verbalize the behavior like this.", "Bs. If your employer expects you to put up with that  then you have a shitty employer. \n\nHis behavior was not just typical rude cranky customer attitude, it was abusive & OP handled themselves very well. \n\nFYI I\u2019ve worked in customer service like positions & all of my employers would\u2019ve been so angry at me for just putting up with him berating me like that. I hung up on more than 1 person who decided to use me as a verbal punching bag just bc they thought they could get away with it. Every time I told my employer what happened & what I did they told me they we\u2019re glad I stood up for myself & if that person called back to let them know & they\u2019d deal with them bc they would not let that person treat their staff that way.", "No, you don\u2019t.

I literally had an HR rep tell me that I\u2019m not allowed to used the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d as it\u2019s an admission of guilt and leaves you liable for a lawsuit. What you can/can\u2019t say to customers is very patrolled. \n\nMorally I want to say you handled that well in terms of \u201csticking up for yourself;\u201d but from a professionalism stance, HR will say you are in the wrong. \n\nGo into project based jobs and avoid customer service jobs.

You won\u2019t again. It sounds like you did fine.", "NTA.  You were polite in your response despite the verbal abuse.  That is pretty professional and hopefully the old coot went home and maybe felt some guilt.", "NTA. Management is not there to have your back in most circumstances, unfortunately.

SHARE PLATES\u201d in a super condescending voice. So I stare at her and go like those? And point to them. They were right by her right hand. \n\u201cOh\u201d that\u2019s all I got from her. \nIDGAF what you\u2019re going through don\u2019t take it out on others.", "NTA you did nothing wrong, no reason to be berated by a cranky old man.", "NTA. Actually I thought it was very professional, you made it clear in a civilised way how he was affecting you, me on the other hand would not have been so kind...", "NTA I get it, I had one idiot old woman thank me for coming to work...I looked straight at her and said, \u201cdon\u2019t thank me, I have no choice I have to work\u201d..", "NTA Old people are the worst, it\u2019s probably been decades since he worked\u2026", "Yeah I don\u2019t think this response even remotely qualified as snarky.  It was basically the equivalent of \u201cplease stop abusing me, thank you.\u201d", "People like you who think this shit is normal are why customer service jobs suck.", "If you want to be liable to a lawsuit, then yeah the employer can force them to endure abuse. But no, it is illegal to force an employee to endure abuse in any form", "NTA. Customer facing jobs for 20+ years and I don't take crap from people. I have snarked back to many customers and if my managers have an issue with it, too bad. I work hard, do my job very well and am not going to be treated like crap. \n\nAnd before any one asks, I was at one store for 17 then it closed and have been at the other 2.", "NTA - I think you reacted perfectly", "NTA - good for you for sticking up for yourself. The customer is not always right! \n\nI remember when I worked for a retail store a well-dressed man came up and asked if he found everything okay. He looked at me & in a rude tone he said, \"I don't know what that means.\" Working in retail, you know when someone is just being an ass. I should add, there was absolutely no language barrier.\n\nI then explain if he was looking for anything specific & if he found what he was looking for...he said it again. Rudely. I look this man dead in the face and tell him, \"Well, I get paid to say it.\" He didn't speak to me the rest of the transaction. I topped it off with, \"Have a nice day!\"", "NTA but you could\u2019ve gone about the situation better", "NTA. A minimum wage job should not expect you to brown nose customers that treat you like a verbal punching bag.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA\u2014your manager is not a very good manager. Wearing a customer service or retail uniform feels like the adult equivalent of having a kick me sign on your back. Employees aren\u2019t just there to deal with people\u2019s shit, and having worked a few jobs in the service industry, it still pisses me off how much workers don\u2019t even get treated with basic human respect.", "NTA and I would not have been this nice. The whole customer service no matter the cost to the employee thing is complete and utter bullshit, and frankly breeds exactly this type of narcissistic behavior. You want good service? Be a good customer. Workers are not your slaves and they aren't robots devoid of feelings.", "NTA - your manager isn't a very good one. \n\nIf what you said is accurate, it actually sounds quite reasonable and you handled his behavior well. Good job!\n\nThis \"customer is always right\" message towards employees makes for a toxic work environment, and many workplaces are steering away from it to better support their workers.", "Give yourself a clap on the back.\n\nHe was abusive and you handled it like a Pro.\n\nNTA but your boss is a massive AHOLE", "NTA!", "NTA. Just commenting to say it's possibly also worth looking into the grey rock technique for dealing with narcissists. My partner who worked retail had a theory that a lot of those stereotypical demanding older customers are that way because they need the attention and by this stage of life all their friends and family have noped out of supplying it to them. If they can't get a rise out of you they might start going to other places instead. It's also helpful to have a very low key technique to use when you're not allowed to speak back to customers (you're nta for doing so but these assholes are not worth losing your job over).", "> of course it\u2019s a cranky old man.  \n...  \nI start ringing his multiple cans of cat food (all different flavors, poorly organized ofc  \n...  \n> I was told I was in the wrong. I don\u2019t see how  \n  \nIf you didn't see it there you won't see it here either, but you're not fit for this job.  \nYTA.", "Being paid a barely livable wage only to be yelled at by rude ass customers for no reason? Yeah no, they can get fucked. Customer service workers are still human beings and deserve to be treated with respect."]}
