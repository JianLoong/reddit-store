That was a great, direct response without insulting him or yelling. I\u2019m impressed, and I hope he remembers it next time he\u2019s a cranky AH to someone in a service job.", "NTA.  What you said doesn't sound bad to me.  You are a human being and deserve to be treated with respect.  \n\nNobody has the right to insult cashiers and retail workers.", "Personally I don't think this comes with a b&w answer. Whilst I agree your comment is accurate, and I guess you're NTA, at the same time when you work in customer service you're expected to never argue back. Listen to his bs feedback, but never challenge them. \n\nI've disagreed 1000s times, felt their comments are bs, and just bite my tongue whenever it happens", "NTA - You gave a very polite and appropriate response to someone who was treating you poorly.  Congratulations on standing up for yourself in such a polite and controlled manner.", "You're NTA in this situation, the customer was clearly spoiling for a fight. That said, being snarky to customers is not a good career move in the service industry.", "Definetly NTA. Similar story in nursing, it happens.

They do that :)", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nThat old man was clearly spoiling for a fight and you handled it very well. I'm sorry your manager said you were unprofessional because you were not.

They should be sticking up for you unless you just decided to go off on someone for no reason.", "NTA: people who think they can treat retail workers as such are made twice as bad by shitty management supporting their behavior.    If you see him again, make sure to go a little slower than usual.", "Yes, you are. You choose how you react to people. If you meet rudeness and distract and give it back your just a trashy as the person who started it", "That was a professional reply to a customer who wanted to be angry. In your place, I would have put on my best big clown smile and moved as slow as possible while looking him in the eye. No matter how slow you think I\u2019m being, I can be slower. \n\nNTA", "NTA. From a former retail manager I\u2019m here to say: your manager sucks. Happy employees bring great worker environments which helps provide better customer service. If your employees feel like you won\u2019t back them up, then the entire operation falls apart.", "NTA. My daughter works at a convenience store and has had to deal with her share of rude people while trying to be professional. Sometimes you do everything right and its still not good enough for some people.", "NTA. Your manager is a spineless coward.\n\nHere's the thing with retail: old people think you're there to be their friend, therapist, and emotional punching bags. And with a manager like that, you'll not get an end to them.\n\nKeep standing up for yourself (if you live somewhere you can easily find another job), and know the customer is not always right.\n\nThe full quote is actually quite different from what customers think it means.\n\n\"The customer is always right in matters of taste, even if they are wrong.\"\n\nBasically, customers are idiots and if agreeing with them makes a sale, go for it. But know they're not in the right.\n\nI've used the \"sir/ma'am, I appreciate you're in a hurry. I'm doing my job, and this is my workplace. Please treat me with respect or I will have to refuse you service\".\n\nThe let your manager deal with them. Managers are literally there to deal with bad customers. That's their role in retail. That's why they're paid $2/h more than you.", ">So I looked the old fucker dead in the eye with a fake smile and said very deadpan: \u201cYou know, sir, you\u2019re not being very nice right now.

Please don\u2019t berate me, I\u2019m almost done now.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been in retail for over 20 years.  That wasn\u2019t snarky at all.  You were honest without being insulting, and you got him to stop berating you.  Most important, you were able to finish the transaction and get him out of the store.  \n\nYour manager sounds like this is his first job.  Being \u201cprofessional\u201d does NOT mean standing there like a statue and letting customers insult you however they feel like it.  There\u2019s a code of conduct they need to follow too.\n\nNTA", "NTA. That was much more polite than I've been. I worked at a pet store before during college for 4 years and some people were such absolute knobs. You are fine!! He was a douchedog.", "NTA\n\nNot in the wrong. Your manager just doesn't want to deal with it either", "NTA\n\nI feared the worst when you said \"snarky\" but you handled it like a pro.  Heck that's how my bosses would have us respond to those who are mean (which happens all the time).  How would your boss have handled it?  LET yourself be verbally abused?  No, that's not healthy for work and it only lets those people think they can get away with this behavior.", "ESH. Obviously he was being terribly rude. But there are more customer service appropriate ways to deal with this than calling him out. It sucks, but sometimes you need to bite your tongue with rude customers. I usually recommend the tried and true method of just getting non-responsive except for some \"mhms\" and the job scripts.", "ESH. The customer for being rude to service workers. Your manager for not having your back. But also, I\u2019m sorry but when you work a customer facing job, you\u2019re gonna need to suck it up, or at least release the tension somewhere else that\u2019s not in front of the customer. It is indeed unprofessional to talk back to the customer, and then go tell your manager and expect to be comforted or told good job. Unless you want to risk losing your job, chin up and tough it out.", "NTA", "yeah sorry that's just not how customer facing jobs work ..you literally do have to take a lot of their shit especially at entry level jobs ..it's sucks but that's the job ..", "Exactly. WTH is wrong with the manager?! They are rewarding someone lying?", "I agree with you one hundred percent . The Customers is NOT always right.", "It doesn't have to be. I worked in service-side jobs for my teens and most of my twenties, you can absolutely set expectations like this and most supervisors worth their salt will back you up to the hilt. Having customers rail against your staff is a great way to lower the prestige of your brand, and will ultimately hurt sales and brand goodwill in the long term. Most other customers in line will also, generally, appreciate the pushback against assholes.\n\nDoes that mean a lot of mass market store supervisors with bad training will be jerks just because its what they went through? Of course. But any brand management team and corporate trainer will push for employees to firmly assert normalized manners in this way. It's the sign of a solid employee who can not only manage difficult customers while making a sale, but also managing store prestige.", "It really shouldn't be tho. It's not hard to be nice to people, especially ones just doing their job.", "Sure, but as OP tells it they were polite but firm. They did not insult the customer or yell or even snap at them. It's OK to verbalize the behavior like this.", "Bs. If your employer expects you to put up with that  then you have a shitty employer. \n\nHis behavior was not just typical rude cranky customer attitude, it was abusive & OP handled themselves very well. \n\nFYI I\u2019ve worked in customer service like positions & all of my employers would\u2019ve been so angry at me for just putting up with him berating me like that. I hung up on more than 1 person who decided to use me as a verbal punching bag just bc they thought they could get away with it. Every time I told my employer what happened & what I did they told me they we\u2019re glad I stood up for myself & if that person called back to let them know & they\u2019d deal with them bc they would not let that person treat their staff that way.", "No, you don\u2019t. You have to be polite, but you don\u2019t have to take abuse.", "**Very, very soft YTA**\n\nAs someone who has also worked customer service jobs **it sucks, but you need to shut up and keep lines like that to yourself!** \n\nComments like that can get you fired. is it fair? No! It absolutely sucks, and customer service jobs in the USA are miserable because of people like him; but when you are the employee the liability is on you and the company to maintain professionalism even when the customer is an AH. \n\nMorally I want to say you handled that well in terms of \u201csticking up for yourself;\u201d but from a professionalism stance you are in the wrong. \n\nGo into project based jobs and avoid customer service jobs. I found working for state parks, community gyms/rec centers and landscaping companies are much more pleasant than cashier/customer service jobs.", "NTA.  I thought you were being very polite.", "NTA. I worked in customer service for years and if I had a client like that I used to respond in the same way. You don\u2019t need to take BS from a client like that.", "NTA. You kept your cool and you stated it professionally. You are NOT the punching bag of the general public. Your manager is a bad manager if he doesn't understand that. Working retail sucks: it's not just the low pay and shitty customers, it's management not having your back.", "Post on Not Always Right.  I wish I could have said this to customers.  Management (most) don't protect you from customers.  I have been harrassed by customers and yelled at for not being professional.", "Nta, I understand the frustration, I wish I could do what you did but I\u2019m too scared. Most of the time the customer is in the wrong anyway, the \u201ccustomer is always right\u201d is bs. Why should we just have to sit there and let them take their anger out on us when we\u2019re just doing our jobs? We aren\u2019t punching bags like that guy thinks and what some people in the comments think. Once you\u2019ve had enough you\u2019ve had enough of being nice to them.", "NTA. I had to use the whole \"I understand your frustration\" line with a customer the other day. I did, the situation sucked. But they chose to have a go at me for attempting politeness while I handled the situation. Sometimes customers are determined to pick a fight no matter what", "Nta that's not even snarky", "NTA, absolutely not I\u2019m a supervisor at a grocery store and honestly I\u2019d tell you good job. It\u2019s time we stop letting abuse happen to people just working a minimum wage job. No one should receive any sort of abuse for just working.", "NTA. The mistake is telling your manager. You won\u2019t again. It sounds like you did fine.", "NTA.  You were polite in your response despite the verbal abuse.  That is pretty professional and hopefully the old coot went home and maybe felt some guilt.", "NTA. Management is not there to have your back in most circumstances, unfortunately. You were doing your best, and you were still genial to the old guy in the end.", "ESH.  A good response would have been, \"I have to scan each one for inventory purposes.  If you would like to wait for me to get a manager up here to request approval for me to scan them as a group I would be happy to call one and we can wait (then stop scanning, look him in the eye, and wait for a response)?  Nasty customers are the worst.  Giving a nasty customer the option to wait longer while waiting for his response is the way to go and it leaves you as being professional.  Go check out malicious compliance.", "Truly! If only everyone on AITA could be as direct and truthful as you were! You literally only said out loud exactly what was happening. Absolutely NTA--nice job!", "People saying they should\u2019ve been \u2018professional\u2019 get a customer service job and see how you feel.", "That's not how customer service works at all, I think what OP did is a perfect example of how customer service works. He told someone who was having a tantrum in a reasonable way that the way they are behaving is not acceptable.", "You really don't though. And attitudes like that only perpetuate the abuse, because customers feel like they CAN.."]}
