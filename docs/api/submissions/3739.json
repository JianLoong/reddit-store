We have a four year old and a 7 month old. My husband is in the army, he's in a specific part of it that's quite secretive and as a result he didn't tell me what his actual job was until we got engaged. When we met he told me he was a data analyst that worked for companies abroad which was why he was gone for long periods of time when we were dating. After we got engaged he told me his real job and I was really shocked and also kind of upset because even though it wasn't really his fault that he didn't tell me (he is encouraged to only tell close family) I still felt a little weird about it. I always told him from the start that I didn't want our whole life to be him abroad for months at a time whilst I'm worried that he's dead somewhere. He reassured me he was only going to be in this specific part of the army for a few years because it's such a big deal to be chosen for it and the experience is really valuable before moving to a different part of the army that will allow him to work mostly domestically. Five years later and he's still doing the same work and is deployed abroad for several months at a time. He recently was home for an entire year where we talked about him changing roles soon so he wouldn't be abroad so much, but he willingly redeployed a few months ago and is currently abroad. He's allowed to video call us at specific times and understandably he always takes these opportunities to talk to the kids and me. This week the time he could video call us clashed with our four year old's nursery christmas fair and nativity. We have to be at home on our own computer when we video call him as we aren't allowed to use my phone or have random people in the background so I had to message my husband to tell him that we couldn't make the video call. I didn't think it was a big deal because he video calls every week but he was extremely upset with me for not \"explaining to our daughter that it's important to make time for family\" - she's four years old and barely knows what's going on when they do video chat and I didn't really think it was such a big deal to miss it one time. I filmed her performance at the christmas fair and sent it to him via email, I didn't think he would expect her to miss something fun at school to sit at a computer and talk to him for thirty minutes. I told him that if he was so upset about missing a video call he should be here with her rather than thousands of miles away. This I admit was out of pocket but I was just feeling kind of wound up by the whole thing. \n\nAm I being an asshole here? I know he worries about not coming home or missing out on important things but I was so blindsided by his reaction. He's still being short with me over messages three days later. I'm anonymously asking here because none of my friends know the specifics of my husband's job and I can't vent to them.", "created_utc": 1669947988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za8etm/aita_for_letting_my_kids_skip_video_calling_their/", "score": 522, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He chose a job that takes him away from his family. Yes, that hurts all of you. Yes, he looks forward to your weekly calls. But, no, your lives don't stop while he's gone. When there is an event that he misses, when there's an event that keeps you away from the video call, when there's a milestone like first steps that he didn't see... well, that's sad, but that job was his choice. He should watch the video of the program & be happy he got to see it. I understand that his job is important & military families make sacrifices, but there's no need for extra sacrifices when you're already sacrificing so much. He can keep missing out, or he can change jobs. He knows where you stand, so the repercussions of his choices lie squarely on his shoulders.", "NTA. It's honestly rich coming from him that you have to \"teach your kids about putting family first\", when he's still taking deployment jobs overseas after promising it would only be for a few years. I would've told him the same thing you did, just with more cursing because I'm not even married to him and I'm pissed on your behalf. If he wants to see his kids regularly, he needs to stop going abroad and be a present dad. Weekly calls aren't good enough.", "NTA\n\nOne of the sacrifices of his job is, that you, his family, his children are going to have other things to do at the time of his video calls. Life outside of the army doesn't revolve around his schedule, and sometimes you'll miss his call time. Sucks for your husband, but for your daughter this nativity and Christmas fair was a priority. I don't think your comment was out of pocket. You're allowed to have negative feelings about your husband voluntarily being gone for months in time, when he had told you he'd switch to different career option more near to home.", "I will say from experience NTA.  My kids hardly ever would talk to their dad more than 5 min at that age. He isn't there and so they don't really miss them to terribly.  This was a school function.  Sometimes schedules clash. It happens.  Just like deploying every six months happens.  If he really had the choice to switch jobs why doesn't he? That would piss me off, knowing he could but wouldn't after telling you he would.  Being a military spouse is hard. Sometimes the military member doesn't understand the toll it takes on you as well.  He should remember that is not just always about him. If he is going to readily volunteer to deploy all the time, then you are going to live your life with your kids. If schedules clash Sometimes so be it.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe literally expects your kids to just sit on a shelf waiting for his calls. The older your kids get. The more they will have going on in their lives.", "INFO: is your husband Jack Ryan?", "Sounds like there is a fundamental disconnect in your marriage that goes FAR beyond the video call itself.\n\nAs to whether or not you are TA, lemme ask a follow up question: did you give your husband any advance notice that he wouldn't be able to make the call this week or did you just ghost him?\n\nI'm really suspicious from how you described neither of you communicating well that you sucker punched him with this.", "NTA. \n\nIt's even possible that the kids don't even see him as a father/dad, since he's gone for so long and so many times. \n\nAnd appears that your marriage is somewhat in peril too. Sounded like you don't see him as a real partner right now.\n\nYour husband's choice is work. Ok, it's something that he loves and fulfilled his needs. \nBut it has a price. Been there for his family. The kid are young now, so if he stays home more, perhaps they won't remember much. But what about you?", "NTA. Life happens. My ex-husband was gone a lot with the military. They know that your lives at home don't stop and that calls are missed at times. It's a hard situation, but you aren't an asshole for keeping your family going and functioning while he is away.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is a choice at this point to do these deployments.  How was he in the year that he was home?  Was it a good dynamic and he was helpful and spent a lot of time with them?  Or did he continue to work long hours and came home after they were in bed?  He may have realised that what he expected home life to be (some idealised notion) is not what real life really is and is happy to go on deployment.  He'd spent the previous 4 years away from you guys for long periods and it's very different to be with you a lot more.\n\nAt this point your husband is your kids biological sperm donor but he's not really their dad.  They have a connection with him but they don't have a connection with him.\n\nThere will be more and more potential clashes as the years go if he continues to spend so much time away from them.  This was your daughters only opportunity to attend her Christmas concert for nursery and I take it she'll be at school next year.  She'll get another phone call with her dad next week.  He's already been away for months this time.\n\nI get that his job is important and all that, but he also has a family that he's rapidly losing contact with.\n\nI'd suggest you speak to a marriage counsellor, perhaps linked with the army, for ways to manage this.  And you may have some difficult decisions to make in the future.  You're essentially a single mother and at this point it doesn't really seem like your husband plans on changing jobs so this might continue for a few more years.  It's just whether you can tolerate it.", "NTA", "NTA he doesn't get to complain about this when he willingly redeployed. You've had to stay behind and basically be the sole parent for four years, you're not a bad person for choosing to act like a parent instead of ripping the kids away from their activity.", "NTA. At first I thought yta because I thought it was a pre-scheduled time. But with same-day notice and a school function it wouldn't have made sense to pull your child from the event. You gave him as much notice as possible.", "NTA he wants to see his kids he can get a job that allows him to see his kids. He choose to redeploy it\u2019s his own fault he doesn\u2019t see them regularly. If he wanted to be an active part of his kids life he would get a different job.", "NAH. This is just a rough situation all around. Hopefully you can call each other again soon.", "NTA As a military spouse, I\u2019m super pissed for you. He\u2019s being an AH for expecting a 4 year old to miss her school performance because \u201cit\u2019s important to make time for family\u201d when he\u2019s routinely on deployment away from his family. The fact that it\u2019s last minute notice on top of that really grinds my gears. Your husband should effing know better that your life doesn\u2019t stop when he\u2019s deployed, and you\u2019re absolutely right that your daughter shouldn\u2019t have to miss the the Christmas fair that she practiced so hard for and was looking forward to. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019d say in your husband\u2019s defense is the timing of the Christmas Fair shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to him. Did he know when it was ahead of time? If he had no idea when it was until you told him you couldn\u2019t talk, I can empathize a bit with his disappointment that he couldn\u2019t talk to you that week. And had he known about it ahead of time, he might have been able to schedule the call at a different time. So if you aren\u2019t already, keep him abreast of important events that will conflict with possible phone calls.\n\nAlso, please connect with local military spouses who you can lean on and vent to, and will really \u201cget it.\u201d", "ESH. You were fine until you said the last part about how he should be there instead of thousands of miles away, as if that was a simple thing like him deciding to go to a bar instead.\n\nMeanwhile, he should've been understanding that life happens and sometimes schedules don't work out - he overreacted.", ">I told him that if he was so upset about missing a video call he should be here\n\nYeah, YTA.  Those video calls are probably the highlight of his week.  Even if you chose to go to your daughter\u2019s recital instead of doing the video call, you should be doing everything you can to arrange another call or accommodate his schedule so he can see his kids.  You should *not* be making him feel bad for being deployed.", "YTA simply for the comment at the end. Also, define voluntary. Was he pressured to go abroad or offered incentives to help your family?

I was in the army 9 years and my husband is still in, just got back from a deployment 1 year ago. I learned that a lot of men like taking deployments because life is easier- they don\u2019t have the burden of raising children, household duties, husbandly duties when they\u2019re deployed. It\u2019s pretty messed up that they can choose to check out and leave you to manage everything on your own then get mad when you don\u2019t drop everything for him.

I wholeheartedly support fellow military spouses setting boundaries and prioritizing their routines independent of the service member. It\u2019s not quite the same but my spouse is on submarines, which means that communication by phone is very infrequent, almost always unexpected, and often one way - like if I miss the call, I can\u2019t always easily return it. So for years I put so much importance on being flexible for that communication that I was actually making myself miserable. Sometimes I love talking to him at 3am cause it\u2019s daytime in whatever port he\u2019s in, or FaceTiming him from an after school Target run, but other times I\u2019m not feeling it, and the disruption to mine and our kids\u2019 schedule isn\u2019t worth a fleeting and forced connection. I know it might be hard on my husband when I don\u2019t make myself available, but he\u2019s never pushed back or tried to make me feel guilty. Your husband needs to get over this ASAP, and the fact that he\u2019s still being snippy about it makes him TA.

He chose to deploy, he wasn't volunteered. He made the conscious decision to put his wants above his family. When he signed up for this he also signed himself up to miss important moments in his family's life, and to have little to no contact with them. He was extremely self centered and, if he didn't think his decision would come with these sacrifices, astoundingly short sighted. Does he realize how lucky he is to get one video call a week? Does he think that all soldiers get that privilege? What if he was living in a pre video call world, and y'all had to rely on hand written letters?

I say this as the child of a father who spent over 50 years working for a government intelligence service in a covert job. He also traveled extensively and in the years before cell phones  we went weeks without hearing from my dad or even really knowing where he was. I can remember hearing that a bomb went off in a particular airport and knowing that he was flying out of that airport that day; and waiting 8 hours to hear that his flight had left an hour before the bomb exploded. When my spouse left the service my dad tried to recruit him to join the agency. I told my spouse that if he did, I would divorce him; the life I lived as a child and that I watched my mother live was not the one I wanted for my family.

Although, I can understand why he is upset. I get it. I really do. Those calls are very likely the one thing he has to look forward to, and it's likely a very long weekend between video calls for him. I get that you cannot put every single thing on hold to always be at home when those calls come. Sometimes things happen. But, if you can be there, I would highly suggest doing everything you can to make it happen. Because *now you DO KNOW * just how important these calls are to him! When my dad was deployed, video chat wasn't even possible, it didn't exist yet! So we were lucky to get a phone call on a secure land line! I worried every single day that he might end up dead, blown up by some landmine, or taken out by a sniper, when he was in the Gulf War. Being able to talk to each other..... It meant everything, not just to dad, but us! I had massive anxiety every time he was gone! Especially during the war! He was gone 8-10 months out of almost every year while I was growing up. It was difficult. But we did it.  \n\nSo while I say NTA in this instance, *YOU* did know very well what his job was and what it entailed before you actually married him. You did in fact choose this life while having all of the information. So it's unfair to make it seem like he's doing something wrong by being in the military and being deployed. Your post reads to me like you are very resentful that he is in. If I am mistaken, then my apologies. The thing about the military, and it's the same across all branches, where they send personnel, and for how long, it's beyond their control! Unfortunately that's just the way it is. Always has been. \n\nI understand that military life is not for everyone. However, there are resources available to help you cope! You absolutely can speak with other Army wives going through tt same things. Not too mention the fact that there are also Ombudsmen available to help you through these things, ie tough deployments. My mom was an Ombudsman for years! She helped *A LOT* of other military wives and through the years! I was always in awe of her. \n\nReach out for help. And talk to your husband.

Does he ask about what you have going on in the week? Is there a family calendar he could see where he would know what events are happening at home?

Especially at their young age when the concept of time is pretty loose (what's 1 week or 2 weeks difference)? I agree with what some other Redditors said, it will be like a punishment to your child and they could start to resent video time with dad if it makes them miss something else they were looking forward to. Either way, it's your judgement call because you are the parent who is currently present.\n\n(3) Gently remind your husband that you and family are fully supporting his voluntary redeployment as best you can....so in return he can also support and respect the family's commitments.

He lied and his profession until they were engaged.  But she deserves better. I'm sure she could find someone who prioritizes her.", "Another other way to look at this, this isn\u2019t just about it being between him and her. This was about her kid being able to on in with normal kid things and not be bound to arbitrary restrictions chosen by adults for their own purposes.\n\nAs long as he has a choice of whether to continue this assignment abroad or be reassigned closer to home, he is still *choosing* to be way from his children (and his wife). He can hate that he missed an opportunity for a weekly chat, but he shouldn\u2019t really be salty at the mother. It could be E S H, but he\u2019s definitely the bigger AH regarding this situation. And specific to this scenario about the kid\u2019s activity, OP is NTA", "She knew he worked abroad, but she literally didn't know it was for the military until after they got engaged...", "I can\u2019t assess this case, obviously, but spouses not having a clue is often SOP. One of my uncles was a sub commander, would be submerged for months and couldn\u2019t share details ever\u2014before, during or after. 20 yrs after retiring he still can\u2019t tell anyone, including his spouse, where he was and what he was doing. Same for a great uncle who served during WWII\u2014he was not allowed to tell anyone ever, even his spouse, what he was up to. He died without sharing a single detail.", "I'm surprised I had to scroll lso far for someone else to be suspicious of him. He is either doing these things and keeping her in the dark beyond required or he isn't military at all. \n\n It's throwing up so many red flags. Honestly I think he's straight up lying and has never even served. Or did serve but now is a mercenary or something, but I'm more inclined to believe he's just a liar. Navy seals and green berets can tell you they're in the military when they meet you. Am I supposed to believe this guy is in some uber secret military team that he can't even tell people anything about his job? The US is spooky but the odds are so low of this being true. I'd believe it more if he said he was a CIA operative", "Before my husband got out of the military, he had a job with this sort of secrecy as well. I was brought in by his CO and they basically told me that he would be unavailable, I was told not to talk about it, be understanding that he couldn\u2019t talk about it even with me, and there was a ton of paperwork and clearance forms I had to sign to even go into that meeting. Some jobs are like that. My husband stayed true to his word and got out after a couple of years though.", "AND then he made her a bunch of false promises about how he was gonna transfer soon and be home much more.  He's just stringing her along.", "Yeah, that was a dick move. She still chose to stay with him and have children knowing he's in the military, it's not like he would stop being in the military, just that he would transfer to a different branch within the military. He lied, and she saw the world through rose tinted glasses, ESH.", "Yeah, you're right, he is choosing that now. Is she working? Does he actually have the ability to move branches within the military? If he did, would he have to take a pay cut? Again, I agree with you, he's an asshole. But she chose to marry that asshole knowing what he does. IMO she should have ran away when she found out he lied to her until they were engaged.\n\n Besides, she was still dating him even when she knew he had a job that required him to be away from home, regardless of if she knew exactly what that job was. Again, if she wanted a man who was home all the time, she shouldn't have married someone who's job forces them to be away for long periods of time. This is also on her, she CHOSE to marry him knowing what his job was. He's an asshole, and she tried to change him, ESH.", "And she still chose to marry him. You're not obligated to marry or have children after getting engaged. I agree that he shouldn't have lied, but she still had the time and knowledge necessary to back out. My judgment is still ESH.", "So in your head, she was supposed to wait until *after* his lies proved themselves as such to get married or have kids? Interesting view. And here I just went in trusting my partner about the plans we made prior to marriage.", "You do realize how strong the sunk costs fallacy and general feeling of love is, right? This may have been something that would have been a deal breaker for her had he been clear from the start but she didn't feel justified leaving when a relationship is established. That's entirely on him for tricking her in the first place, imo, not on her. He also told her during engagement that this was only for a little while longed, and as someone who wasn't intending to date a military man and wasnt able to talk to other partners of military personelle before because she didnt even know he was military, she likely didn't have the knowledge available to her about whether that was likely to be true.\n\nI do totally agree that it's a bad call to trust a military man when he says something like that, but as she didn't have the experience of dating a military man, she didn't have the chance to form the understanding of what marrying one meant.", "Not at all. She still knew he had a job that required him to be away from home, even if she didn't know exactly what that job was. I'm saying she knew that he worked abroad, and she knew exactly what that job was before she chose to marry him. She also knew he lied about his job and still chose to marry him. \n\nI'm not allowed to marry someone who I know does meth, and then complain that they still do meth years after marrying them. She knew what he did for work and still married and had a child with him. That's on her. He lied to her, that's on him. Blame is never 100%  on one party, we all make choices and sometimes we have to live with those choices.", "How is this entirely on him when she knew he had a job that required him to be away from home when they were dating? Sure, she didn't know exactly what that job was, but she still pursued a relationship with someone who had an incompatible lifestyle, and still chose to marry him after she knew the whole situation. Please tell me why she isn't responsible for her choices?", "Comparing the military industrial complex to a method addiction might be the literal best, most accurate thing I've read on reddit for a long time. 10/10, you deserve an award.", "NTA sadly his attitude is why there are many divorces in military families. He can choose to make sacrifices but the whole family doesn\u2019t need to miss out on important milestones due to his choices.", "NTA. He should take his own advise and make time for family. Whether that is time at home, or giving his family some space to maneuver. If this is the first time in all those years, then I don't think he should be upset. He could have just been happy for this daughter to have that experience.", "NTA.  I was your daughter.  My dad prioritized the military (and continues to venerate it) 32 years after he retired with 20 years of service.  He and it was always more important than us kids, our feelings, our lives and our experiences.  As a result, we grew up independent and without a close relationship with our father.  \n\nI\u2019m a parent with kids of my own and I still resent it and parent intentionally in opposite of it. We are not close, my dad continues to focus on learning about the military/history and does the bare minimum for his family and grandchildren (and by does, I mean he shows up to holidays if I host). \n\nYour husband is making choices that are his to make. But you and your kids are living and your life experiences matter too and shouldn\u2019t be shunted aside for him.  It is what it is.  NTA", "NTA\n\nThe balls in this guy for saying \"it's important to make time for family\" when he WILLINGLY leaves his family for MONTHS at a time.", "NTA but I couldn't do that out of fear that it might be his last call.", "NTA.  If it's so important to make time for family then he should start making it.  I get that he's in the military and it is not usually an option to stay or go but in this case it sounds like it IS an option and he made the decision to leave you raising the kids as a single mom.", "NTA. He\u2019s being unfair. He\u2019s choosing to be gone for career gain and glory. Granted, his career success helps the family but he\u2019s not the only sacrificing and he should be sensitive to all of the uncomfortable parts of his being gone not just where it affects him.", "YTA before you married and had children you knew he was in the military. If this was something that you could not have handled you had to chances to leave the relationship. I am a wife of a veteran and the parent of a soldier. You take those calls when they come.  He made the choice to serve his country you made the choice to be with him. \n\nYes being married to someone in the military can be hard because they do get deployed at times. Sometimes it is not easy to change your job. If he is in a special unit that he was selected for that means he is damn good at his job. That is a honor. The one thing that military need is support from their love ones at home. That is what gets them through. Right now my daughter is serving in South Korea and I don\u2019t care what I am doing when she calls I answer.\n\nWhat if something happened to him the last memory you are going to have is being mad about a phone call and that right there is on both of you. \n\nI am proud of the work my husband did and I am proud of what my daughter is doing. \n\nI am also warning anyone that comments in my post speaking bad of the military will not like the response that they will get.", "NTA \n\nHe CHOSE to continue a job that keeps him away from his family. He wanted to see/talk to his children, he should have kept his promise to move to a job that keeps him home. He CHOSE not too", "NTA. My husband knew before he left that we would be available when we were available, but I wouldn\u2019t be sitting by the phone waiting for a call. He was gone 6-8 months every year, and I told him we would go along with him for the ride as long as that was what he was choosing to do, but that means he had to fit into our lives and not the other way around. Our routines and everything stayed the same and so he had to fit into that when he was home. It was the only way to keep 3 kids and myself sane.", "OP, I think you would benefit from asking this question in a military sub to get their opinion or shed light on how he\u2019s feeling so you guys can find some common ground. Everyone here is likely to side with you because everyone here is not likely in the military or married to military. If he cannot tell you what kind of job he\u2019s doing overseas, then that means that he is potentially in constant danger from enemy forces and HAS to keep both his role and location a secret because OPSEC. For all you know, he could be in Ukraine. If his life is in danger, then to him, he views those calls as potentially the last time you will ever see/speak to each other. Your daughter\u2019s Christmas performance is a big deal, but if that was potentially the last time she would ever see her dad\u2026which one is more important? It sounds like that\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to say here. If he\u2019s allowed to, he needs to communicate that with you. \u201cI\u2019m in a very dangerous part of the world, I love you and I do this job to provide for you, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll never see you guys again, so please make time for my calls, I know it\u2019s not fair but that\u2019s how the military works.\u201d My verdict, NAH", "NTA.\n\n>I filmed her performance at the christmas fair and sent it to him via email\n\nYou had an event that you could not reschedule.  You filmed and sent it to him and that is the best you can do.  You have things to do and cant put things on hold every time his call comes.\n\n> I told him that if he was so upset about missing a video call he should be here with her rather than thousands of miles away.\n\nThis is harsh for him to hear, but it is TRUE.  He choose his profession.  If he wants to have that family time he needs to move to a different position where he can be home more.", "NTA...he is making his career choice so jeeds to accept the bad along with the good. Its not like you can explain to a 4 year old what daddys does without breaching security..so sounds like your hands are tied to either hold you children back from thier lives to make time for dad..or let dad miss some conversations", "NTA\n\nHe's choosing his job over his family and is getting upset that his family isn't choosing him over everything else. Maybe explaing that to him, especially since he didn't keep the deal of changing jobs. Im not telling you that you have to get a divorce or anything, but I'd bring up these legitimate concerns to him.", "NTA - He was demanding to hurt his own daughter because he wanted his weekly video call . . . . .  when he was the one to choose to go against your wishes and be abroad while he should be home helping to parent his children.

A \"few\" to me is 20%. When you factor that in to what is normally a 40+ year career we are only half way to a few, I would expect him to still be in this particular branch of the military at least another 3 to 5 years before I would consider this promise broken.\n\nOP is still NTA because someone deployed has to remember that those still at home have lives to lead and other commitments and OP was right to go to the play.

As a milspouse of a man who was in special operations for our entire 15 year marriage, there's very rarely any jobs they can't at least give you some info. I generally knew enough info to know where to send care packages, even when they weren't located on a FOB. And I knew he was SF before we married. Not a secret, especially when he graduated the course just before our engagement. I have found, more often than not, that the guys who act \"super secretive\" tend to be.... NOT special operations in any capacity, and like to have the drama of how special they are for effect. You can absolutely know a lot about your husband's job and training, you can even go to his course graduations and stay at different bases with him while he trains in places if you are a SAHM from time to time. We absolutely did that.

Hes an asshole for lying, but that doesn't absolve her of her choices. Life isn't black and white, there's multiple things at play here. Yes, he lied. But she chose to date someone who works away from home, she chose to do that before she was aware of what exactly it was he did. Even after knowing it was military, she still chose to marry. Even if it was a different role within the military, it's a job that usually requires you to be away from home, regardless of the position. She knew that he had a job that requires him to be away from home, chose to marry him and have a child anyway, then gets upset that she married someone who works away from home. She made that choice, and she is responsible for it. Just because he's an asshole doesn't absolve her of poor choices. Bad take."]}
