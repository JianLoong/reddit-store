We have a four year old and a 7 month old. My husband is in the army, he's in a specific part of it that's quite secretive and as a result he didn't tell me what his actual job was until we got engaged. When we met he told me he was a data analyst that worked for companies abroad which was why he was gone for long periods of time when we were dating. After we got engaged he told me his real job and I was really shocked and also kind of upset because even though it wasn't really his fault that he didn't tell me (he is encouraged to only tell close family) I still felt a little weird about it. I always told him from the start that I didn't want our whole life to be him abroad for months at a time whilst I'm worried that he's dead somewhere. He reassured me he was only going to be in this specific part of the army for a few years because it's such a big deal to be chosen for it and the experience is really valuable before moving to a different part of the army that will allow him to work mostly domestically. Five years later and he's still doing the same work and is deployed abroad for several months at a time. He recently was home for an entire year where we talked about him changing roles soon so he wouldn't be abroad so much, but he willingly redeployed a few months ago and is currently abroad. He's allowed to video call us at specific times and understandably he always takes these opportunities to talk to the kids and me. This week the time he could video call us clashed with our four year old's nursery christmas fair and nativity. We have to be at home on our own computer when we video call him as we aren't allowed to use my phone or have random people in the background so I had to message my husband to tell him that we couldn't make the video call. I didn't think it was a big deal because he video calls every week but he was extremely upset with me for not \"explaining to our daughter that it's important to make time for family\" - she's four years old and barely knows what's going on when they do video chat and I didn't really think it was such a big deal to miss it one time. I filmed her performance at the christmas fair and sent it to him via email, I didn't think he would expect her to miss something fun at school to sit at a computer and talk to him for thirty minutes. I told him that if he was so upset about missing a video call he should be here with her rather than thousands of miles away. This I admit was out of pocket but I was just feeling kind of wound up by the whole thing. \n\nAm I being an asshole here? I know he worries about not coming home or missing out on important things but I was so blindsided by his reaction. He's still being short with me over messages three days later. I'm anonymously asking here because none of my friends know the specifics of my husband's job and I can't vent to them.", "created_utc": 1669947988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za8etm/aita_for_letting_my_kids_skip_video_calling_their/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He chose a job that takes him away from his family. Yes, that hurts all of you. Yes, he looks forward to your weekly calls. But, no, your lives don't stop while he's gone. When there is an event that he misses, when there's an event that keeps you away from the video call, when there's a milestone like first steps that he didn't see... well, that's sad, but that job was his choice. He should watch the video of the program & be happy he got to see it. I understand that his job is important & military families make sacrifices, but there's no need for extra sacrifices when you're already sacrificing so much. He can keep missing out, or he can change jobs. He knows where you stand, so the repercussions of his choices lie squarely on his shoulders.", "NTA. It's honestly rich coming from him that you have to \"teach your kids about putting family first\", when he's still taking deployment jobs overseas after promising it would only be for a few years. I would've told him the same thing you did, just with more cursing because I'm not even married to him and I'm pissed on your behalf. If he wants to see his kids regularly, he needs to stop going abroad and be a present dad. Weekly calls aren't good enough.", "NTA\n\nOne of the sacrifices of his job is, that you, his family, his children are going to have other things to do at the time of his video calls. Life outside of the army doesn't revolve around his schedule, and sometimes you'll miss his call time. Sucks for your husband, but for your daughter this nativity and Christmas fair was a priority. I don't think your comment was out of pocket. You're allowed to have negative feelings about your husband voluntarily being gone for months in time, when he had told you he'd switch to different career option more near to home.", "I will say from experience NTA.  My kids hardly ever would talk to their dad more than 5 min at that age. He isn't there and so they don't really miss them to terribly.  This was a school function.  Sometimes schedules clash. It happens.  Just like deploying every six months happens.  If he really had the choice to switch jobs why doesn't he? That would piss me off, knowing he could but wouldn't after telling you he would.  Being a military spouse is hard. Sometimes the military member doesn't understand the toll it takes on you as well.  He should remember that is not just always about him. If he is going to readily volunteer to deploy all the time, then you are going to live your life with your kids. If schedules clash Sometimes so be it.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe literally expects your kids to just sit on a shelf waiting for his calls. The older your kids get. The more they will have going on in their lives.", "INFO: is your husband Jack Ryan?", "Sounds like there is a fundamental disconnect in your marriage that goes FAR beyond the video call itself.\n\nAs to whether or not you are TA, lemme ask a follow up question: did you give your husband any advance notice that he wouldn't be able to make the call this week or did you just ghost him?\n\nI'm really suspicious from how you described neither of you communicating well that you sucker punched him with this.", "NTA. \n\nIt's even possible that the kids don't even see him as a father/dad, since he's gone for so long and so many times. \n\nAnd appears that your marriage is somewhat in peril too. Sounded like you don't see him as a real partner right now.\n\nYour husband's choice is work. Ok, it's something that he loves and fulfilled his needs. \nBut it has a price. Been there for his family. The kid are young now, so if he stays home more, perhaps they won't remember much. But what about you?", "NTA. Life happens. My ex-husband was gone a lot with the military. They know that your lives at home don't stop and that calls are missed at times. It's a hard situation, but you aren't an asshole for keeping your family going and functioning while he is away.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is a choice at this point to do these deployments.  How was he in the year that he was home?  Was it a good dynamic and he was helpful and spent a lot of time with them?  Or did he continue to work long hours and came home after they were in bed?  He may have realised that what he expected home life to be (some idealised notion) is not what real life really is and is happy to go on deployment.  He'd spent the previous 4 years away from you guys for long periods and it's very different to be with you a lot more.\n\nAt this point your husband is your kids biological sperm donor but he's not really their dad.  They have a connection with him but they don't have a connection with him.\n\nThere will be more and more potential clashes as the years go if he continues to spend so much time away from them.  This was your daughters only opportunity to attend her Christmas concert for nursery and I take it she'll be at school next year.  She'll get another phone call with her dad next week.  He's already been away for months this time.\n\nI get that his job is important and all that, but he also has a family that he's rapidly losing contact with.\n\nI'd suggest you speak to a marriage counsellor, perhaps linked with the army, for ways to manage this.  And you may have some difficult decisions to make in the future.  You're essentially a single mother and at this point it doesn't really seem like your husband plans on changing jobs so this might continue for a few more years.  It's just whether you can tolerate it.", "NTA", "NTA he doesn't get to complain about this when he willingly redeployed. You've had to stay behind and basically be the sole parent for four years, you're not a bad person for choosing to act like a parent instead of ripping the kids away from their activity.", "NTA. At first I thought yta because I thought it was a pre-scheduled time. But with same-day notice and a school function it wouldn't have made sense to pull your child from the event. You gave him as much notice as possible.", "NTA he wants to see his kids he can get a job that allows him to see his kids. He choose to redeploy it\u2019s his own fault he doesn\u2019t see them regularly. If he wanted to be an active part of his kids life he would get a different job.", "NAH. This is just a rough situation all around. Hopefully you can call each other again soon.", "NTA As a military spouse, I\u2019m super pissed for you. He\u2019s being an AH for expecting a 4 year old to miss her school performance because \u201cit\u2019s important to make time for family\u201d when he\u2019s routinely on deployment away from his family. The fact that it\u2019s last minute notice on top of that really grinds my gears. Your husband should effing know better that your life doesn\u2019t stop when he\u2019s deployed, and you\u2019re absolutely right that your daughter shouldn\u2019t have to miss the the Christmas fair that she practiced so hard for and was looking forward to. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019d say in your husband\u2019s defense is the timing of the Christmas Fair shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to him. Did he know when it was ahead of time? If he had no idea when it was until you told him you couldn\u2019t talk, I can empathize a bit with his disappointment that he couldn\u2019t talk to you that week. And had he known about it ahead of time, he might have been able to schedule the call at a different time. So if you aren\u2019t already, keep him abreast of important events that will conflict with possible phone calls.\n\nAlso, please connect with local military spouses who you can lean on and vent to, and will really \u201cget it.\u201d", "ESH. You were fine until you said the last part about how he should be there instead of thousands of miles away, as if that was a simple thing like him deciding to go to a bar instead.\n\nMeanwhile, he should've been understanding that life happens and sometimes schedules don't work out - he overreacted.", ">I told him that if he was so upset about missing a video call he should be here\n\nYeah, YTA.  Those video calls are probably the highlight of his week.  Even if you chose to go to your daughter\u2019s recital instead of doing the video call, you should be doing everything you can to arrange another call or accommodate his schedule so he can see his kids.  You should *not* be making him feel bad for being deployed.", "YTA simply for the comment at the end. Also, define voluntary. Was he pressured to go abroad or offered incentives to help your family?

I was in the army 9 years and my husband is still in, just got back from a deployment 1 year ago. I learned that a lot of men like taking deployments because life is easier- they don\u2019t have the burden of raising children, household duties, husbandly duties when they\u2019re deployed. It\u2019s pretty messed up that they can choose to check out and leave you to manage everything on your own then get mad when you don\u2019t drop everything for him.

I wholeheartedly support fellow military spouses setting boundaries and prioritizing their routines independent of the service member. It\u2019s not quite the same but my spouse is on submarines, which means that communication by phone is very infrequent, almost always unexpected, and often one way - like if I miss the call, I can\u2019t always easily return it. So for years I put so much importance on being flexible for that communication that I was actually making myself miserable. Sometimes I love talking to him at 3am cause it\u2019s daytime in whatever port he\u2019s in, or FaceTiming him from an after school Target run, but other times I\u2019m not feeling it, and the disruption to mine and our kids\u2019 schedule isn\u2019t worth a fleeting and forced connection. I know it might be hard on my husband when I don\u2019t make myself available, but he\u2019s never pushed back or tried to make me feel guilty. Your husband needs to get over this ASAP, and the fact that he\u2019s still being snippy about it makes him TA.

He chose to deploy, he wasn't volunteered. He made the conscious decision to put his wants above his family. When he signed up for this he also signed himself up to miss important moments in his family's life, and to have little to no contact with them. He was extremely self centered and, if he didn't think his decision would come with these sacrifices, astoundingly short sighted. Does he realize how lucky he is to get one video call a week? Does he think that all soldiers get that privilege? What if he was living in a pre video call world, and y'all had to rely on hand written letters?

I would have done the same, and I think it\u2019s lovely you sent the video to your husband so he could be a small part of it. \n\nI\u2019ll say it again: your life doesn\u2019t stop just because he\u2019s away. NTA.", "NTA. He chose a job that takes him out of normal family life, and chooses to continue it. That means sometimes he has to make family sacrifices in place of you and the kids (ie missing family time vs missing community events)", "exactly! So his daughter has to sacrifice having her dad around AND sacrifice a special event? I empathize with him feeling like he's missing out, but you don't put that burden on your child.", "Well, she probably also thought his words meant something... so.. this might be the problem", "Why not? He chose to stay in the military despite claiming he would change careers, he deserves to be made to feel bad about missing moments", "Deployment is not a choice sometimes BUT you CAN volunteer for deployments and assignments. -Coming from someone prior service.\nI know a lot of service members who volunteer for deployments because deployment life is simpler and easier than having to deal with their family life. It\u2019s easier to just go to work/gym/barracks-30 min call home. Than having to deal with work and then coming home and being and active parent/husband.", "But you can volunteer to deploy. The difference here is clear. He volunteered.", "Where is the communication issue? It sounds like she clearly communicated what the issue is for her and that he chooses to ignore this.", "\"Wich isn't long in the military\" -\n\n\nI think it very much is. In my country an aktive duty term is around 4 to 6 years.\n\n\nIt seems in the us they start with 4 year term and after that terms are 2-6 years. \nhttps://www.asvabprogram.com/media-center-article/67\n\nAfter 20 years of aktive duty you are elible for retirment. 5 years is already 25% of that. \n\n\nAs he already did the job before they married, 5 years is definitly long in military thinking and it is very possible he signed up for another term while already being married to her. \n\n\nI read he was home for a whole year and we miss obviously a lot lot lot of details, but as active duty serving is not a career you do for 40 years like an office job..."]}
