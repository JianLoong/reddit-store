We have a four year old and a 7 month old. My husband is in the army, he's in a specific part of it that's quite secretive and as a result he didn't tell me what his actual job was until we got engaged. When we met he told me he was a data analyst that worked for companies abroad which was why he was gone for long periods of time when we were dating. After we got engaged he told me his real job and I was really shocked and also kind of upset because even though it wasn't really his fault that he didn't tell me (he is encouraged to only tell close family) I still felt a little weird about it. I always told him from the start that I didn't want our whole life to be him abroad for months at a time whilst I'm worried that he's dead somewhere. He reassured me he was only going to be in this specific part of the army for a few years because it's such a big deal to be chosen for it and the experience is really valuable before moving to a different part of the army that will allow him to work mostly domestically. Five years later and he's still doing the same work and is deployed abroad for several months at a time. He recently was home for an entire year where we talked about him changing roles soon so he wouldn't be abroad so much, but he willingly redeployed a few months ago and is currently abroad. He's allowed to video call us at specific times and understandably he always takes these opportunities to talk to the kids and me. This week the time he could video call us clashed with our four year old's nursery christmas fair and nativity. We have to be at home on our own computer when we video call him as we aren't allowed to use my phone or have random people in the background so I had to message my husband to tell him that we couldn't make the video call. I didn't think it was a big deal because he video calls every week but he was extremely upset with me for not \"explaining to our daughter that it's important to make time for family\" - she's four years old and barely knows what's going on when they do video chat and I didn't really think it was such a big deal to miss it one time. I filmed her performance at the christmas fair and sent it to him via email, I didn't think he would expect her to miss something fun at school to sit at a computer and talk to him for thirty minutes. I told him that if he was so upset about missing a video call he should be here with her rather than thousands of miles away. This I admit was out of pocket but I was just feeling kind of wound up by the whole thing. \n\nAm I being an asshole here? I know he worries about not coming home or missing out on important things but I was so blindsided by his reaction. He's still being short with me over messages three days later. I'm anonymously asking here because none of my friends know the specifics of my husband's job and I can't vent to them.", "created_utc": 1669947988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za8etm/aita_for_letting_my_kids_skip_video_calling_their/", "score": 286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He chose a job that takes him away from his family. Yes, that hurts all of you. Yes, he looks forward to your weekly calls. But, no, your lives don't stop while he's gone. When there is an event that he misses, when there's an event that keeps you away from the video call, when there's a milestone like first steps that he didn't see... well, that's sad, but that job was his choice. He should watch the video of the program & be happy he got to see it. I understand that his job is important & military families make sacrifices, but there's no need for extra sacrifices when you're already sacrificing so much. He can keep missing out, or he can change jobs. He knows where you stand, so the repercussions of his choices lie squarely on his shoulders.", "NTA. It's honestly rich coming from him that you have to \"teach your kids about putting family first\", when he's still taking deployment jobs overseas after promising it would only be for a few years. I would've told him the same thing you did, just with more cursing because I'm not even married to him and I'm pissed on your behalf. If he wants to see his kids regularly, he needs to stop going abroad and be a present dad. Weekly calls aren't good enough.", "NTA\n\nOne of the sacrifices of his job is, that you, his family, his children are going to have other things to do at the time of his video calls. Life outside of the army doesn't revolve around his schedule, and sometimes you'll miss his call time. Sucks for your husband, but for your daughter this nativity and Christmas fair was a priority. I don't think your comment was out of pocket. You're allowed to have negative feelings about your husband voluntarily being gone for months in time, when he had told you he'd switch to different career option more near to home.", "I will say from experience NTA.  My kids hardly ever would talk to their dad more than 5 min at that age. He isn't there and so they don't really miss them to terribly.  This was a school function.  Sometimes schedules clash. It happens.  Just like deploying every six months happens.  If he really had the choice to switch jobs why doesn't he? That would piss me off, knowing he could but wouldn't after telling you he would.  Being a military spouse is hard. Sometimes the military member doesn't understand the toll it takes on you as well.  He should remember that is not just always about him. If he is going to readily volunteer to deploy all the time, then you are going to live your life with your kids. If schedules clash Sometimes so be it.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe literally expects your kids to just sit on a shelf waiting for his calls. The older your kids get. The more they will have going on in their lives.", "INFO: is your husband Jack Ryan?", "Sounds like there is a fundamental disconnect in your marriage that goes FAR beyond the video call itself.\n\nAs to whether or not you are TA, lemme ask a follow up question: did you give your husband any advance notice that he wouldn't be able to make the call this week or did you just ghost him?\n\nI'm really suspicious from how you described neither of you communicating well that you sucker punched him with this.", "NTA. \n\nIt's even possible that the kids don't even see him as a father/dad, since he's gone for so long and so many times. \n\nAnd appears that your marriage is somewhat in peril too. Sounded like you don't see him as a real partner right now.\n\nYour husband's choice is work. Ok, it's something that he loves and fulfilled his needs. \nBut it has a price. Been there for his family. The kid are young now, so if he stays home more, perhaps they won't remember much. But what about you?", "NTA. Life happens. My ex-husband was gone a lot with the military. They know that your lives at home don't stop and that calls are missed at times. It's a hard situation, but you aren't an asshole for keeping your family going and functioning while he is away.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is a choice at this point to do these deployments.  How was he in the year that he was home?  Was it a good dynamic and he was helpful and spent a lot of time with them?  Or did he continue to work long hours and came home after they were in bed?  He may have realised that what he expected home life to be (some idealised notion) is not what real life really is and is happy to go on deployment.  He'd spent the previous 4 years away from you guys for long periods and it's very different to be with you a lot more.\n\nAt this point your husband is your kids biological sperm donor but he's not really their dad.  They have a connection with him but they don't have a connection with him.\n\nThere will be more and more potential clashes as the years go if he continues to spend so much time away from them.  This was your daughters only opportunity to attend her Christmas concert for nursery and I take it she'll be at school next year.  She'll get another phone call with her dad next week.  He's already been away for months this time.\n\nI get that his job is important and all that, but he also has a family that he's rapidly losing contact with.\n\nI'd suggest you speak to a marriage counsellor, perhaps linked with the army, for ways to manage this.  And you may have some difficult decisions to make in the future.  You're essentially a single mother and at this point it doesn't really seem like your husband plans on changing jobs so this might continue for a few more years.  It's just whether you can tolerate it.", "NTA", "NTA he doesn't get to complain about this when he willingly redeployed. You've had to stay behind and basically be the sole parent for four years, you're not a bad person for choosing to act like a parent instead of ripping the kids away from their activity.", "NTA. At first I thought yta because I thought it was a pre-scheduled time. But with same-day notice and a school function it wouldn't have made sense to pull your child from the event. You gave him as much notice as possible.", "NTA he wants to see his kids he can get a job that allows him to see his kids. He choose to redeploy it\u2019s his own fault he doesn\u2019t see them regularly. If he wanted to be an active part of his kids life he would get a different job.", "NAH. This is just a rough situation all around. Hopefully you can call each other again soon.", "NTA As a military spouse, I\u2019m super pissed for you. He\u2019s being an AH for expecting a 4 year old to miss her school performance because \u201cit\u2019s important to make time for family\u201d when he\u2019s routinely on deployment away from his family. The fact that it\u2019s last minute notice on top of that really grinds my gears. Your husband should effing know better that your life doesn\u2019t stop when he\u2019s deployed, and you\u2019re absolutely right that your daughter shouldn\u2019t have to miss the the Christmas fair that she practiced so hard for and was looking forward to. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019d say in your husband\u2019s defense is the timing of the Christmas Fair shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to him. Did he know when it was ahead of time? If he had no idea when it was until you told him you couldn\u2019t talk, I can empathize a bit with his disappointment that he couldn\u2019t talk to you that week. And had he known about it ahead of time, he might have been able to schedule the call at a different time. So if you aren\u2019t already, keep him abreast of important events that will conflict with possible phone calls.\n\nAlso, please connect with local military spouses who you can lean on and vent to, and will really \u201cget it.\u201d", "ESH. You were fine until you said the last part about how he should be there instead of thousands of miles away, as if that was a simple thing like him deciding to go to a bar instead.\n\nMeanwhile, he should've been understanding that life happens and sometimes schedules don't work out - he overreacted.", ">I told him that if he was so upset about missing a video call he should be here\n\nYeah, YTA.  Those video calls are probably the highlight of his week.  Even if you chose to go to your daughter\u2019s recital instead of doing the video call, you should be doing everything you can to arrange another call or accommodate his schedule so he can see his kids.  You should *not* be making him feel bad for being deployed.", "YTA simply for the comment at the end. Also, define voluntary. Was he pressured to go abroad or offered incentives to help your family?

I was in the army 9 years and my husband is still in, just got back from a deployment 1 year ago. I learned that a lot of men like taking deployments because life is easier- they don\u2019t have the burden of raising children, household duties, husbandly duties when they\u2019re deployed. It\u2019s pretty messed up that they can choose to check out and leave you to manage everything on your own then get mad when you don\u2019t drop everything for him.

I wholeheartedly support fellow military spouses setting boundaries and prioritizing their routines independent of the service member. It\u2019s not quite the same but my spouse is on submarines, which means that communication by phone is very infrequent, almost always unexpected, and often one way - like if I miss the call, I can\u2019t always easily return it. So for years I put so much importance on being flexible for that communication that I was actually making myself miserable. Sometimes I love talking to him at 3am cause it\u2019s daytime in whatever port he\u2019s in, or FaceTiming him from an after school Target run, but other times I\u2019m not feeling it, and the disruption to mine and our kids\u2019 schedule isn\u2019t worth a fleeting and forced connection. I know it might be hard on my husband when I don\u2019t make myself available, but he\u2019s never pushed back or tried to make me feel guilty. Your husband needs to get over this ASAP, and the fact that he\u2019s still being snippy about it makes him TA.

He chose to deploy, he wasn't volunteered. He made the conscious decision to put his wants above his family. When he signed up for this he also signed himself up to miss important moments in his family's life, and to have little to no contact with them. He was extremely self centered and, if he didn't think his decision would come with these sacrifices, astoundingly short sighted. Does he realize how lucky he is to get one video call a week? Does he think that all soldiers get that privilege? What if he was living in a pre video call world, and y'all had to rely on hand written letters?

I would have done the same, and I think it\u2019s lovely you sent the video to your husband so he could be a small part of it. \n\nI\u2019ll say it again: your life doesn\u2019t stop just because he\u2019s away. NTA.", "NTA. He chose a job that takes him out of normal family life, and chooses to continue it. That means sometimes he has to make family sacrifices in place of you and the kids (ie missing family time vs missing community events)", "exactly! So his daughter has to sacrifice having her dad around AND sacrifice a special event? I empathize with him feeling like he's missing out, but you don't put that burden on your child.", "Well, she probably also thought his words meant something... so.. this might be the problem", "Why not? He chose to stay in the military despite claiming he would change careers, he deserves to be made to feel bad about missing moments", "Deployment is not a choice sometimes BUT you CAN volunteer for deployments and assignments. -Coming from someone prior service.\nI know a lot of service members who volunteer for deployments because deployment life is simpler and easier than having to deal with their family life. It\u2019s easier to just go to work/gym/barracks-30 min call home. Than having to deal with work and then coming home and being and active parent/husband.", "But you can volunteer to deploy. The difference here is clear. He volunteered.", "Where is the communication issue? It sounds like she clearly communicated what the issue is for her and that he chooses to ignore this.", "\"Wich isn't long in the military\" -\n\n\nI think it very much is. In my country an aktive duty term is around 4 to 6 years.\n\n\nIt seems in the us they start with 4 year term and after that terms are 2-6 years. \nhttps://www.asvabprogram.com/media-center-article/67\n\nAfter 20 years of aktive duty you are elible for retirment. 5 years is already 25% of that. \n\n\nAs he already did the job before they married, 5 years is definitly long in military thinking and it is very possible he signed up for another term while already being married to her. \n\n\nI read he was home for a whole year and we miss obviously a lot lot lot of details, but as active duty serving is not a career you do for 40 years like an office job...", "NTA but\u2026.you need to have a really deep conversation with your spouse about your expectations and his about his career. I say this as the child of a father who spent over 50 years working for a government intelligence service in a covert job. He also traveled extensively and in the years before cell phones  we went weeks without hearing from my dad or even really knowing where he was. I can remember hearing that a bomb went off in a particular airport and knowing that he was flying out of that airport that day; and waiting 8 hours to hear that his flight had left an hour before the bomb exploded. When my spouse left the service my dad tried to recruit him to join the agency. I told my spouse that if he did, I would divorce him; the life I lived as a child and that I watched my mother live was not the one I wanted for my family. I appreciate the sacrifices that my dad and mom made during the Cold War to do what they thought was best to keep our country safe, but this is not the life I would want for my family or my children.  It may not be the life you want for you or yours either.", "NTA and honestly I would seek therapy bcuz he should\u2019ve told you sooner about what he really does and personal for that lie imo he seems to be a hypocrite also imo.", "NTA in this particular situation. Although, I can understand why he is upset. I get it. I really do. Those calls are very likely the one thing he has to look forward to, and it's likely a very long weekend between video calls for him. I get that you cannot put every single thing on hold to always be at home when those calls come. Sometimes things happen. But, if you can be there, I would highly suggest doing everything you can to make it happen. Because *now you DO KNOW * just how important these calls are to him! When my dad was deployed, video chat wasn't even possible, it didn't exist yet! So we were lucky to get a phone call on a secure land line! I worried every single day that he might end up dead, blown up by some landmine, or taken out by a sniper, when he was in the Gulf War. Being able to talk to each other..... It meant everything, not just to dad, but us! I had massive anxiety every time he was gone! Especially during the war! He was gone 8-10 months out of almost every year while I was growing up. It was difficult. But we did it.  \n\nSo while I say NTA in this instance, *YOU* did know very well what his job was and what it entailed before you actually married him. You did in fact choose this life while having all of the information. So it's unfair to make it seem like he's doing something wrong by being in the military and being deployed. Your post reads to me like you are very resentful that he is in. If I am mistaken, then my apologies. The thing about the military, and it's the same across all branches, where they send personnel, and for how long, it's beyond their control! Unfortunately that's just the way it is. Always has been. \n\nI understand that military life is not for everyone. However, there are resources available to help you cope! You absolutely can speak with other Army wives going through tt same things. Not too mention the fact that there are also Ombudsmen available to help you through these things, ie tough deployments. My mom was an Ombudsman for years! She helped *A LOT* of other military wives and through the years! I was always in awe of her. \n\nReach out for help. And talk to your husband. Because it sounds like he's struggling, too.", "NTA. Being away is what He chose. He doesn\u2019t get to complain about missing out. And he certainly doesn\u2019t get to complain that the three of you don\u2019t plan your entire life around him.", "NTA. If he keeps going abroad the children are only going to get older and have more activities. Having more activities will definitely lead to more missed 30 video calls. This was his choice", "NTA. You aren't performing monkeys to appear at his summons. You have lives and plans, and I would argue that a four year old's performance in a Christmas event is an important event that absolutely gets priority over a weekly video call. Your DH sounds quite selfish.", "NTA. I agree with everyone here about him realising that life happens at home for the three of you while he is gone. I wonder if he is remotely interested/involved in that life or if he\u2019s just thinking about his own schedule/work while he is away and you all need to slot in with that because his brain hasn\u2019t even thought of what you might be doing. Does he ask about what you have going on in the week? Is there a family calendar he could see where he would know what events are happening at home? Not just so he could avoid or be aware that these times are off limits- but so all five of you could feel like you are sharing your life/experiences despite the deployment. Good luck OP. I think your husband needs to try to be more involved in the life he\u2019s not living at home with you and the children.", "He sure has got some balls lecturing HER about making time for family!", "Exactly. If making time for \"family time\" is so important to him why didn't he choose to make time for \"family time\" and I stead took a job away? He chose to miss out. Oh well, sad for him.  NTA OP.", "Agree with you about the post, I was thinking the same thing. However, even if this was an involuntary deployment, she\u2019s still NTA. The children should be the priority regardless and this was an important event to the child. It\u2019s only going to get worse as they get older because there will be more and more activities and they won\u2019t want to be sitting by the phone.", "My entire post is completely anonymous, I'm not sharing any identifiable details so I don't really see what damage has been done? He didn't tell me about what he did when we were dating because he was encouraged not to, I choose to believe him when he says that as I'm not sure why he would lie about it if he didn't need to but I can see why it would seem strange.", "Why should the child be punished? My husband would never want our daughter to miss something important to her because of his schedule. It\u2019s super unfortunate, but add it to the list of many things unfair for everyone in a deployment.", "I think to prevent built-up resentment and this from happening again in the future...you and your husband should specifically outline the expectations of family calls.\n\nFor instance:\n\n(1) best effort to make the call and to communicate conflicting times as soon as possible - emphasis on best effort\n\n(2) in the event of unavoidable conflict despite best efforts, special event that is important to the children will take priority. Especially at their young age when the concept of time is pretty loose (what's 1 week or 2 weeks difference)? I agree with what some other Redditors said, it will be like a punishment to your child and they could start to resent video time with dad if it makes them miss something else they were looking forward to. Either way, it's your judgement call because you are the parent who is currently present.\n\n(3) Gently remind your husband that you and family are fully supporting his voluntary redeployment as best you can....so in return he can also support and respect the family's commitments. There will be times that don't work out, especially as the kids grow older and do more activities.", "That's a very fair point, too. I definitely remember being really disappointed as a young kid whenever I had to miss out on events like this, regardless of the reason why or how \"important\" it may have been. I also saw the OP say she only had a few hours notice, so the kids would be operating on the idea that they were going to this event for quite a while, and would be understandably upset if they didn't get to go.", "Him lying to you, and whether or not that was actually necessary aside, you have absolutely posted identifying details. You shared his and your age, how long you've been married and that you have two kids and what their ages are. You also shared that your four year old just performed at her school's Christmas fair three days ago, which is extremely specific. \n\nI urge you to please discuss this with your husband so he can explain to you what exactly OPSEC is, and the fact that you are never anonymous online, especially with the amount of details you shared. People online have found a person's location based off air traffic trails in streamed videos before. You've made it extremely easy for someone to find you if they wanted to.", "Wait, so by voluntary you didn't mean that he volunteered but that he didn't change jobs? That's a big misrepresentation what happened. So I say YTA I have the feeling that you used it because you are pissed. Especially regarding your last part.", "It\u2019s a communication problem because they are on differs pages about him leaving the military.  He might not realize how frustrated she is with things. They need to talk frankly about things.", "Nta. As a military spouse myself, I'd be short with him when he left for that voluntary deployment. He'd be lucky if I answered once a month. As a couple you plan your future together. It's especially important to be on the same page in the military because you're often taken away from your support people by moving. I'd be giving out ultimatums..", "NTA. He should be home as he promised you several years ago. I'm going out on a limb here because I have q really suspicious mind, are you sure he's in the army and deployed?  Is there anyway he could be leading a double life?", "NTA he needs to realise the older your kids get the more he will miss out on if he keeps this job.  Your children's schools and clubs will not organise around his work.  Your kids come first not him getting time with them but them getting to have a normal life which means when events happen they are involved in thats during his call time he will miss out on seeing his kids rather than them missing out on events and activities.  Family dose come first but the needs of the children come before the wants of a parent.", "INFO for your husband\n\nWhen was the last time he made time for family rather than prioritising work", "NTA OP\n\nGuessing he\u2019s lashing out at you because deep down he realizes this is because of his choices, and it\u2019s easier to be mad at you then to do the self reflection that requires, and to acknowledge to himself these are choices.\n\nAnd also I\u2019m so very sorry. Deployments are hard. And being blind-sided into military/ deployment life is brutal.\n\nThank **you** for your service. It\u2019s very clear who in your family is actually sacrificing the life they want for their country. And it\u2019s not your husband who is doing a job he clearly loves.", "NTA. You should.divorce your part time husband who does nothing to help you and your \"family\" while he's \"working\".\n\nLet me guess, he's in food service?", "NTA \n\nHe needs to grow up.", "Yes", "You chose to stay with him when you knew he had that job! It\u2019s understandable to be frustrated but that\u2019s part of a relationship, it\u2019s not always easy. If he truly refuses to ever quit then that\u2019s fine but he seems to be down to quit soon, even though if it still would take a year or two. Taking an hour or whatever once a week is not that much to ask for, this is your loved one not a random friend.\nI\u2019m sure his professional situation is much more complex than you\u2019re explaining it here, knowing how the army usually functions. Quitting at the wrong time could ruin his future prospects and his life goals in general.", "INFO: Real talk, do you think your husband is ever going to transfer out of this division?", "Are you sure that families are not allowed to come with.......??????", "NTA He's selfish.", "Nta, you're doing fine.", "NTA \n\nMy dad traveled a lot for work when I was growing, although not in the military, so his schedule wasn't as strict, and he would never have expected us to miss events for calls with him. \n\nYour husband has chosen this life. That means he misses time with the kids. It does NOT mean they have to miss activities for his calls. They didn't choose this and have a right to keep living, which apparently DH doesn't understand.", "NTA you let him know from the start that y\u2019all had your kids Christmas program. You can\u2019t explain family time to a 4 year old. I FaceTime with my 4yo nephew and you\u2019re right he\u2019s all over the place barely paying attention. \nHe\u2019s T A for willingly deploying abroad for a few months when y\u2019all have a newborn.", "NTA.

He does not get to control your child\u2019s lives or your life while he is away.  You are sorry, but just because he can only call at certain times and days does not mean you and your children must wait with baited breath for those specific times.  The children are getting older and will be involved in activities.  And you can vent to friends.  I know many people who are military who work in secret parts of the government.  Of course you can\u2019t say where he works or what he does, but you can vent about the situations that are caused by his job.", "Omg. Loose lips sink ships- or whatever the army version of that saying. It\u2019s probably best to not post much of this on here, you could have left how super secret your husbands job is off reddit. You likely succeeded in getting him out if his job. That being said, NTA for missing that one event. It sounds like you\u2019re usually good about them. My husband got out because family was more important to him and he didn\u2019t want the kids to be raised in the military. We decided this together. Neither of you are bad people but there are many reasons military marriages sometimes don\u2019t last.", "If he had the choice of not deploying then NTA. He can't expect your lives to hault while he's away. As far as making time for family, that's pretty rich coming from him. He willing spends months oversees. You should have waited to have children until he changed his role like he told you he would before you were married.", "And he chose to do this with a NEWBORN. The younger kid is only 7 months old now and he left a few months ago - so when the baby was like 3 months old?!? He\u2019s got some nerve lecturing anyone when he took voluntary deployment to actively avoid parenting.", "What he means is women and kids (girls) have to put men first.", "Since his job is apparently so top-secret, it might be helpful if he asks the other guys in his specific unit if their wives and girlfriends have a group chat. I doubt she'll be allowed to talk to the partner of someone who turns a wrench in the motor pool or works payroll at the local base.", "I don\u2019t know why your downvoted. That\u2019s 100 percent the first thing I thought too. Lol.", "BuT He iS Off dEFendINg HiS CouNTrY! \n\nThat's got to trump family life. Right? \n\nRight? \n\n(/s)", "Sounds like your husband had a reality check that you & your kids have a whole life that doesn't stop when he's not around. And he didn't like that. So he's getting angry at you because he wants to pressure you into prioritising his calls so he doesn't feel like that again. \n\nBut in reality, if your kids have to spend their whole childhoods having to drop out of many things they have worked on and been excited about for weeks & months on a few hours notice because their Dad has called, than they are doing to grow up hating you both for it. \n\nWhich begs the question, is your husband truly going to transfer out of this division?", "I can't believe this post is still up. So many identifying details! And so cavalier about them.\n\nIf your husband job is classified to the extent that you can't call him in public, you certainly shouldn't post with so many identifying details on Reddit.\n\nHasn't he instructed you on not sharing details of your life online? This is honestly baffling to me.", "Those details are all tweaked slightly from reality to maintain anonymity without affecting the overall facts of the situation. Please don't worry!", "It is very common for when they are deployed not to tell exact dates or where they are going.  \n\nI have friends that are in intelligence for the military and they have very high clearances. They don\u2019t tell what exactly they do but they still tell people they are in the Army or whAt ever branch they are in.", "Exactly, like wouldn't most people say, \"I work in the Army\" and leave it at that? Why lie and say he works in a completely separate career? How can you trust he doesn't have a 2nd family & a high paying job and that's why he disappears because he's flip-flopping between you both?", "I've met his coworkers, seen his uniforms, etc etc and unless he's hiring out a set to look like he's on deployment in the background when we video call I believe that he is actually where he is lol."]}
