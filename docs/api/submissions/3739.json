We have a four year old and a 7 month old. My husband is in the army, he's in a specific part of it that's quite secretive and as a result he didn't tell me what his actual job was until we got engaged. When we met he told me he was a data analyst that worked for companies abroad which was why he was gone for long periods of time when we were dating. After we got engaged he told me his real job and I was really shocked and also kind of upset because even though it wasn't really his fault that he didn't tell me (he is encouraged to only tell close family) I still felt a little weird about it. I always told him from the start that I didn't want our whole life to be him abroad for months at a time whilst I'm worried that he's dead somewhere. He reassured me he was only going to be in this specific part of the army for a few years because it's such a big deal to be chosen for it and the experience is really valuable before moving to a different part of the army that will allow him to work mostly domestically. Five years later and he's still doing the same work and is deployed abroad for several months at a time. He recently was home for an entire year where we talked about him changing roles soon so he wouldn't be abroad so much, but he willingly redeployed a few months ago and is currently abroad. He's allowed to video call us at specific times and understandably he always takes these opportunities to talk to the kids and me. This week the time he could video call us clashed with our four year old's nursery christmas fair and nativity. We have to be at home on our own computer when we video call him as we aren't allowed to use my phone or have random people in the background so I had to message my husband to tell him that we couldn't make the video call. I didn't think it was a big deal because he video calls every week but he was extremely upset with me for not \"explaining to our daughter that it's important to make time for family\" - she's four years old and barely knows what's going on when they do video chat and I didn't really think it was such a big deal to miss it one time. I filmed her performance at the christmas fair and sent it to him via email, I didn't think he would expect her to miss something fun at school to sit at a computer and talk to him for thirty minutes. I told him that if he was so upset about missing a video call he should be here with her rather than thousands of miles away. This I admit was out of pocket but I was just feeling kind of wound up by the whole thing. \n\nAm I being an asshole here? I know he worries about not coming home or missing out on important things but I was so blindsided by his reaction. He's still being short with me over messages three days later. I'm anonymously asking here because none of my friends know the specifics of my husband's job and I can't vent to them.", "created_utc": 1669947988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za8etm/aita_for_letting_my_kids_skip_video_calling_their/", "score": 637, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He chose a job that takes him away from his family. Yes, that hurts all of you. Yes, he looks forward to your weekly calls. But, no, your lives don't stop while he's gone. When there is an event that he misses, when there's an event that keeps you away from the video call, when there's a milestone like first steps that he didn't see... well, that's sad, but that job was his choice. He should watch the video of the program & be happy he got to see it. I understand that his job is important & military families make sacrifices, but there's no need for extra sacrifices when you're already sacrificing so much. He can keep missing out, or he can change jobs. He knows where you stand, so the repercussions of his choices lie squarely on his shoulders.", "NTA. It's honestly rich coming from him that you have to \"teach your kids about putting family first\", when he's still taking deployment jobs overseas after promising it would only be for a few years. I would've told him the same thing you did, just with more cursing because I'm not even married to him and I'm pissed on your behalf. If he wants to see his kids regularly, he needs to stop going abroad and be a present dad. Weekly calls aren't good enough.", "NTA\n\nOne of the sacrifices of his job is, that you, his family, his children are going to have other things to do at the time of his video calls. Life outside of the army doesn't revolve around his schedule, and sometimes you'll miss his call time. Sucks for your husband, but for your daughter this nativity and Christmas fair was a priority. I don't think your comment was out of pocket. You're allowed to have negative feelings about your husband voluntarily being gone for months in time, when he had told you he'd switch to different career option more near to home.", "I will say from experience NTA.  My kids hardly ever would talk to their dad more than 5 min at that age. He isn't there and so they don't really miss them to terribly.  This was a school function.  Sometimes schedules clash. It happens.  Just like deploying every six months happens.  If he really had the choice to switch jobs why doesn't he? That would piss me off, knowing he could but wouldn't after telling you he would.  Being a military spouse is hard. Sometimes the military member doesn't understand the toll it takes on you as well.  He should remember that is not just always about him. If he is going to readily volunteer to deploy all the time, then you are going to live your life with your kids. If schedules clash Sometimes so be it.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe literally expects your kids to just sit on a shelf waiting for his calls. The older your kids get. The more they will have going on in their lives.", "INFO: is your husband Jack Ryan?", "Sounds like there is a fundamental disconnect in your marriage that goes FAR beyond the video call itself.\n\nAs to whether or not you are TA, lemme ask a follow up question: did you give your husband any advance notice that he wouldn't be able to make the call this week or did you just ghost him?\n\nI'm really suspicious from how you described neither of you communicating well that you sucker punched him with this.", "NTA. \n\nIt's even possible that the kids don't even see him as a father/dad, since he's gone for so long and so many times. \n\nAnd appears that your marriage is somewhat in peril too. Sounded like you don't see him as a real partner right now.\n\nYour husband's choice is work. Ok, it's something that he loves and fulfilled his needs. \nBut it has a price. Been there for his family. The kid are young now, so if he stays home more, perhaps they won't remember much. But what about you?", "NTA. Life happens. My ex-husband was gone a lot with the military. They know that your lives at home don't stop and that calls are missed at times. It's a hard situation, but you aren't an asshole for keeping your family going and functioning while he is away.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is a choice at this point to do these deployments.  How was he in the year that he was home?  Was it a good dynamic and he was helpful and spent a lot of time with them?  Or did he continue to work long hours and came home after they were in bed?  He may have realised that what he expected home life to be (some idealised notion) is not what real life really is and is happy to go on deployment.  He'd spent the previous 4 years away from you guys for long periods and it's very different to be with you a lot more.\n\nAt this point your husband is your kids biological sperm donor but he's not really their dad.  They have a connection with him but they don't have a connection with him.\n\nThere will be more and more potential clashes as the years go if he continues to spend so much time away from them.  This was your daughters only opportunity to attend her Christmas concert for nursery and I take it she'll be at school next year.  She'll get another phone call with her dad next week.  He's already been away for months this time.\n\nI get that his job is important and all that, but he also has a family that he's rapidly losing contact with.\n\nI'd suggest you speak to a marriage counsellor, perhaps linked with the army, for ways to manage this.  And you may have some difficult decisions to make in the future.  You're essentially a single mother and at this point it doesn't really seem like your husband plans on changing jobs so this might continue for a few more years.  It's just whether you can tolerate it.", "NTA", "NTA he doesn't get to complain about this when he willingly redeployed. You've had to stay behind and basically be the sole parent for four years, you're not a bad person for choosing to act like a parent instead of ripping the kids away from their activity.", "NTA. At first I thought yta because I thought it was a pre-scheduled time. But with same-day notice and a school function it wouldn't have made sense to pull your child from the event. You gave him as much notice as possible.", "NTA he wants to see his kids he can get a job that allows him to see his kids. He choose to redeploy it\u2019s his own fault he doesn\u2019t see them regularly. If he wanted to be an active part of his kids life he would get a different job.", "NAH. This is just a rough situation all around. Hopefully you can call each other again soon.", "NTA As a military spouse, I\u2019m super pissed for you. He\u2019s being an AH for expecting a 4 year old to miss her school performance because \u201cit\u2019s important to make time for family\u201d when he\u2019s routinely on deployment away from his family. The fact that it\u2019s last minute notice on top of that really grinds my gears. Your husband should effing know better that your life doesn\u2019t stop when he\u2019s deployed, and you\u2019re absolutely right that your daughter shouldn\u2019t have to miss the the Christmas fair that she practiced so hard for and was looking forward to. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019d say in your husband\u2019s defense is the timing of the Christmas Fair shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to him. Did he know when it was ahead of time? If he had no idea when it was until you told him you couldn\u2019t talk, I can empathize a bit with his disappointment that he couldn\u2019t talk to you that week. And had he known about it ahead of time, he might have been able to schedule the call at a different time. So if you aren\u2019t already, keep him abreast of important events that will conflict with possible phone calls.\n\nAlso, please connect with local military spouses who you can lean on and vent to, and will really \u201cget it.\u201d", "ESH. You were fine until you said the last part about how he should be there instead of thousands of miles away, as if that was a simple thing like him deciding to go to a bar instead.\n\nMeanwhile, he should've been understanding that life happens and sometimes schedules don't work out - he overreacted.", ">I told him that if he was so upset about missing a video call he should be here\n\nYeah, YTA.  Those video calls are probably the highlight of his week.  Even if you chose to go to your daughter\u2019s recital instead of doing the video call, you should be doing everything you can to arrange another call or accommodate his schedule so he can see his kids.  You should *not* be making him feel bad for being deployed.", "YTA simply for the comment at the end. Also, define voluntary. Was he pressured to go abroad or offered incentives to help your family?

I was in the army 9 years and my husband is still in, just got back from a deployment 1 year ago. I learned that a lot of men like taking deployments because life is easier- they don\u2019t have the burden of raising children, household duties, husbandly duties when they\u2019re deployed. It\u2019s pretty messed up that they can choose to check out and leave you to manage everything on your own then get mad when you don\u2019t drop everything for him.

I wholeheartedly support fellow military spouses setting boundaries and prioritizing their routines independent of the service member. It\u2019s not quite the same but my spouse is on submarines, which means that communication by phone is very infrequent, almost always unexpected, and often one way - like if I miss the call, I can\u2019t always easily return it. So for years I put so much importance on being flexible for that communication that I was actually making myself miserable. Sometimes I love talking to him at 3am cause it\u2019s daytime in whatever port he\u2019s in, or FaceTiming him from an after school Target run, but other times I\u2019m not feeling it, and the disruption to mine and our kids\u2019 schedule isn\u2019t worth a fleeting and forced connection. I know it might be hard on my husband when I don\u2019t make myself available, but he\u2019s never pushed back or tried to make me feel guilty. Your husband needs to get over this ASAP, and the fact that he\u2019s still being snippy about it makes him TA.

He chose to deploy, he wasn't volunteered. He made the conscious decision to put his wants above his family. When he signed up for this he also signed himself up to miss important moments in his family's life, and to have little to no contact with them. He was extremely self centered and, if he didn't think his decision would come with these sacrifices, astoundingly short sighted. Does he realize how lucky he is to get one video call a week? Does he think that all soldiers get that privilege? What if he was living in a pre video call world, and y'all had to rely on hand written letters?

I say this as the child of a father who spent over 50 years working for a government intelligence service in a covert job. He also traveled extensively and in the years before cell phones  we went weeks without hearing from my dad or even really knowing where he was. I can remember hearing that a bomb went off in a particular airport and knowing that he was flying out of that airport that day; and waiting 8 hours to hear that his flight had left an hour before the bomb exploded. When my spouse left the service my dad tried to recruit him to join the agency. I told my spouse that if he did, I would divorce him; the life I lived as a child and that I watched my mother live was not the one I wanted for my family. I appreciate the sacrifices that my dad and mom made during the Cold War to do what they thought was best to keep our country safe, but this is not the life I would want for my family or my children.

Although, I can understand why he is upset. I get it. I really do. Those calls are very likely the one thing he has to look forward to, and it's likely a very long weekend between video calls for him. I get that you cannot put every single thing on hold to always be at home when those calls come. Sometimes things happen. But, if you can be there, I would highly suggest doing everything you can to make it happen. Because *now you DO KNOW * just how important these calls are to him! When my dad was deployed, video chat wasn't even possible, it didn't exist yet! So we were lucky to get a phone call on a secure land line! I worried every single day that he might end up dead, blown up by some landmine, or taken out by a sniper, when he was in the Gulf War. Being able to talk to each other..... It meant everything, not just to dad, but us! I had massive anxiety every time he was gone! Especially during the war! He was gone 8-10 months out of almost every year while I was growing up. It was difficult. But we did it.  \n\nSo while I say NTA in this instance, *YOU* did know very well what his job was and what it entailed before you actually married him. You did in fact choose this life while having all of the information. So it's unfair to make it seem like he's doing something wrong by being in the military and being deployed. Your post reads to me like you are very resentful that he is in. If I am mistaken, then my apologies. The thing about the military, and it's the same across all branches, where they send personnel, and for how long, it's beyond their control! Unfortunately that's just the way it is. Always has been. \n\nI understand that military life is not for everyone. However, there are resources available to help you cope! You absolutely can speak with other Army wives going through tt same things. Not too mention the fact that there are also Ombudsmen available to help you through these things, ie tough deployments. My mom was an Ombudsman for years! She helped *A LOT* of other military wives and through the years! I was always in awe of her. \n\nReach out for help. And talk to your husband.

Especially at their young age when the concept of time is pretty loose (what's 1 week or 2 weeks difference)? I agree with what some other Redditors said, it will be like a punishment to your child and they could start to resent video time with dad if it makes them miss something else they were looking forward to. Either way, it's your judgement call because you are the parent who is currently present.\n\n(3) Gently remind your husband that you and family are fully supporting his voluntary redeployment as best you can....so in return he can also support and respect the family's commitments.

Why did she continue to pursue that relationship when she found out he was military, a job notorious for being away from home? Just because she isn't an asshole doesn't absolve her of her choices.

Honestly I think he's straight up lying and has never even served. Or did serve but now is a mercenary or something, but I'm more inclined to believe he's just a liar. Navy seals and green berets can tell you they're in the military when they meet you. Am I supposed to believe this guy is in some uber secret military team that he can't even tell people anything about his job? The US is spooky but the odds are so low of this being true. I'd believe it more if he said he was a CIA operative", "Before my husband got out of the military, he had a job with this sort of secrecy as well.

This may have been something that would have been a deal breaker for her had he been clear from the start but she didn't feel justified leaving when a relationship is established.

He also told her during engagement that this was only for a little while longed, and as someone who wasn't intending to date a military man and wasnt able to talk to other partners of military personelle before because she didnt even know he was military, she likely didn't have the knowledge available to her about whether that was likely to be true.\n\nI do totally agree that it's a bad call to trust a military man when he says something like that, but as she didn't have the experience of dating a military man, she didn't have the chance to form the understanding of what marrying one meant.", "Not at all. She still knew he had a job that required him to be away from home, even if she didn't know exactly what that job was.

I ALSO SAID I DON'T THINK HE LIKES HIS JOB MORE THAN HIS FAMILY.\n\nNot sure who you're arguing with since we're both talking about completely different things.  Let me know if you need me to explain it again.", "So he'd known about it for weeks and must have known it was going to clash, then. So, in other words, he wanted you to cancel last minute.\n\nDefinitely NTA, then and he's being a massive one expecting his kid to suddenly miss out on something they were probably excited for.\n\nI'm sure it hurt him that he missed his vid call with his family, but he's an adult and he can keep his emotions in check. A little kid cannot.", ">\tTake that one variable out of the equation, do you still think her position is reasonable?\n\nYes. She told him she wasn\u2019t making the kid miss a limited window school function. Their lives get to go on. They don\u2019t put them on hold because he **chose** this assignment. Even if she was cool with him working abroad, her choice to not make the kid miss the event would still hold. And he\u2019d be the asshole for giving her shit about it.\n\nHe\u2019s telling his wife she should teach their daughter to prioritize family while he proceeds to do exactly *not that*. Your argument that she is also at fault because she \u201cknew what she was getting into\u201d fails specifically **because** he lied. He said it would be a \u201cfew years.\u201d It\u2019s been more than a few.\n\nLet\u2019s go with your sidestep of ignoring the fact that he lied. Let\u2019s ignore that he lied. He was mandatorily volun-told to go do this. It still stands that his family shouldn\u2019t be required to put their lives on hold. Being assigned like that against your will would be a good reason to leave the military at your first opportunity.\n\nThey likely didn\u2019t get married the day after he proposed. And you need about 10 months for a pregnancy. So he\u2019s been doing this for five or six years since she told her. It\u2019s a voluntary assignment. So as you said yourself, he lied and is the asshole for it. Yet for some reason your claiming she is also the asshole because she didn\u2019t magically know in advance that he was going to lie and keep choosing work over family.\n\nYour question as to whether she works or it would mean a pay cut are irrelevant. They can address and plan for that together once he comes home, if he chooses to do so, which he choosing not to. Every time. Remember as well that he came home for a while and then **chose** to redeploy abroad.\n\nHe consistently choosing to prioritize this assignment/role over his family. He can make choices, but missing opportunities to talk to his daughter is a consequence of *his* choices at this point \u2014 not his wife\u2019s. \n\nHe\u2019s probably not going to change until it\u2019s too late and he comes home to a divorce and a custody agreement. Those are going to be the consequences of his choices, which you espouse to believe in.\n\nBut none of that is going to make OP also the asshole.", "Its not unreasonable to expect a military person to get out when they tell you they will. I've been in the military and let me tell you, we think those who tell their wives/spouses they are gonna get out and then don't are huge assholes. This is not something normal, not something you should ever expect like with a cheater.", "If it's the US, they all have the same rules. And I know people from all over the country, in every branch. There aren't different rules for different parts of the country, that's not how any of this works.", "No idea where your from, but most countries are not going to make their military keep being in the military a secret. What they do or where they are stationed - yes but not the whole being in the military. Considering it\u2019s international law that military has to id themselves as military while working (some caveats) that would be pretty ridiculous to cover it up from friends.", "If he did not like his job more than his family, he would be with his family or at the very least not ice out his family for not throwing out their schedule to suit his.  \n\n\nI am arguing that he likes his job more than his family, and you don't agree, that is okay, but that does not make my arguments invalid", ">Yes. She told him she wasn\u2019t making the kid miss a limited window school function. Their lives get to go on. They don\u2019t put them on hold because he chose this assignment.\n\nAgain, I agree, he is a hypocritical asshole, nothing new here. \n\n>He\u2019s telling his wife she should teach their daughter to prioritize family while he proceeds to do exactly not that.\n\nAgain, asshole. \n\n\n\n>Your argument that she is also at fault because she \u201cknew what she was getting into\u201d fails specifically because he lied. He said it would be a \u201cfew years.\u201d It\u2019s been more than a few.\n\nThis I where I disagree. A few years is not a concrete time-line, a lot of people don't even know that \"a few\" generally means three, most just use it colloquially to mean, not that many. 5 years is realistically not that much longer than 3, maybe she should have asked him to specify exactly what he meant. Besides, does he even still have the option to change roles within the military? Would it come with a major pay cut? Did he ever actually want to switch roles, and only said \"a few years\" because he felt pressured? There's a lot of variables that I would need to know to accurately assess blame, hence the ESH judgement. \n\n>Your question as to whether she works or it would mean a pay cut are irrelevant. They can address and plan for that together once he comes home, if he chooses to do so, which he choosing not to. Every time. Remember as well that he came home for a while and then chose to redeploy abroad.\n\nAgain, I disagree. This is putting the cart before the horse, you don't quit your job and then look for work, you look for work while you're still employed. Do you actually know if he has other options within the military, or even in the public sector, or are you just assuming it would work out somehow? \n\n>Hea consistently choosing to prioritize this assignment/role over his family. He can make choices, but missing opportunities to talk to his daughter is a consequence of his choices at this point \u2014 not his wife\u2019s. \n\nThat's a matter of perspective, he's choosing to provide for his family by going out for deployment. Again, do you know that he has other opportunities, or are you just assuming?\n\n>He\u2019s probably not going to change until it\u2019s too late and he comes home to a divorce and a custody agreement. Those are going to be the consequences of his choices, which you espouse to believe in.\n\n\nYeah, you're probably right. Is this because she chose to marry someone who works, and has always worked away from home, or because he hasn't found a job that allows him to stay home? They're two sides of the same coin, both decisions lead them into this situation. The onice of change is on him, I agree. He could quit his job and be more present in his family's life, I agree. But would that actually be the best decision for him and his family? Let's not forget that this story is being told from her perspective.. I'm willing to bet there's more at play here. \n\n>But none of that is going to make OP also the asshole.\n\nAgain, I agree, she's not an asshole, but she is still responsible for the choices she has made. If she wanted a husband who's at home, she could have ensured that by not marrying someone who's job it was, and always has been to be away from home. If I didn't want to be cheated on, It wouldn't be a good move to marry someone who's cheated on me in the past. Even if they're the cheating asshole, I would be the person who stayed with them, and I would be responsible for that decision. Again, he's an asshole. Period. She stayed with him knowing that he both lied, and works away from home. I feel bad for her, but she could have known better.", "That's not my point, the point is this has always been his lifestyle, and SHE is the one who wants it to change. It's entirely possible that he actually has no desire to change careers, but felt pressured to say he would because it's what she wants. I don't want to assume without context, but I really don't think she's blameless here. She dated him knowing his lifestyle, she married him knowing his lifestyle, she had a kid knowing his lifestyle. If she didn't want this kind of life, then why did she pursue it and accept it for so long? Am I really the only one seeing this nuance? And for the like 100th time, he's an asshole. I'm not defending him. But she made a choice to be with that asshole, and I'm not going to defend her.\n\nEdit: I'm not trying to be obtuse, I just honestly don't think she's blameless, I happily accept the downvotes. She may not be an asshole, but that doesn't absolve her of responsibility.", "I'm not going to say anything about location, region or countries so we'll just leave it at that. :)", "Good for you.  Your  thought processes don't add up and I'll try to humor you.\n\nIf he liked his job more than his family he wouldn't have given a shit about not talking to them.  Since he is upset, and makes a point to get in contact with them every chance he gets, your *argument* no longer makes any sense.", ">\tAgain, I agree, she\u2019s not an asshole\n\nThen you don\u2019t vote E S H. That requires both parties of the dispute being an asshole to each other. This is him being an asshole to her because she didn\u2019t make her daughter miss out on something as a consequence of a decision *he* made.\n\n>\tI feel bad for her, but she could have known better.\n\nCareful. That\u2019s very close to victim-blaming. We\u2019re going to have to be done here. Sorry. I\u2019m not looking to add my block list today.\n\nGood day. See you around the sub", "If it's straight up not the US military then the rules could be different. I don't really care either way, just letting you know if it is the US, this isn't normal. If it's not the US, then I don't know, nor do I care. Just trying to help you with your asshole husband", "You fail at this point...\n\nHe does care about his family...\n\nJust not as much as he cares for his job\n\nIt is not a question of caring or not, it is a question about how much.", "Thank you, I appreciate that, wasn't trying to come off as rude sorry if I did."]}
