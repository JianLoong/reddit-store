Three of the kids are teens, and the younger girl is in middle school. She said she is going to keep dating him until the three older kids are out of the house, and then she will move in with him. She said she can handle living with the youngest a couple of years because she is the \"least annoying\" and will be able to babysit if they have a baby.

She got mad and said I had no right to decide how she lives her life.

First off NTA. I would be very concerned if this was my sister. Serious red flags that he did not tell her that he had children from the jump. Then she is ok with lowering the bar that she set for herself in regards to dating a man with children. OP you are right, that is a stupid plan. Don\u2019t worry, this crap fest won\u2019t last long.

Describing your bf/gf kid as \u201cleast annoying\u201d is horrible. And then only moving in with them because she can use the youngest as a babysitter for your own kid you might have with this guy? Your sister really just sounds like a shitty person.

Did she tell her boyfriend her grand plan?", "Nta", "NTA and I hope the guy she's dating eventually finds out her plans.

If I had kids and was dating someone I would absolutely want to know if they \"hated\" my children and were just waiting for the first moment it would be acceptable to kick them out of my life.", "ESH. Personally I would have just laughed at her plan (maybe silently if I wanted to be polite) and said, *\"gosh, I hope that can work out for you. We'll see, I guess.\"* (edit: forgot to flag this as sarcastic tone, with eye roll)", "ESH. You are right that her plan is stupid, delusional and shows classic \"evil step mom\" tendencies. But the way you put it to her was equally stupid. Name calling and aggression are not going to make anyone re-consider or change their mind. And for the sake of the children involved, it *would* be best if your sister backed off from this. \n\n(And planning to use a child for free childcare is actually abusive.)", "Your sister is correct that you don\u2019t have to decide how she lives her life.\n\nShe seems wrong about much everything else - but you cannot convince her. In fact, the more you try, the stronger she would resist. So, step back. Tell her you disagree with her - but will be there for her regardless.\n\nNTA - but try to let go of the judge-y attitude in favor of more loving one. Your sister is more likely to hear it.", "Ehhhh. I\u2019m really leaning more towards NAH. If she really likes the guy, she\u2019ll find her way around any issues she has. You should be happy that she\u2019s happy (if she is). There\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a relationship slow but that\u2019s for them to discuss. \n\nThe name calling might be a bit much, but your heart is in the right place.

Your sister is acting extremely unwisely and her plan is silly and delusional. She is wasting her time. She needs a wake up call. You tried to give her one.", "Yta for interfering with her choice. Just let her suffer the consequences.", "NTA.\n\nOne thing you might want to point out - if all of his kids are badly behaved, then it's likely from his parenting.  They're a peak into what he's like when he's not on his best behavior during dates.  Either he doesn't give his kids structure so they're entitled jerks or he's an entitled jerk and they're growing up just like him.  Does she really want to have kids with him and risk those kids behaving like the current batch?  (I realize there might be a mom/ex-wife in the picture somewhere and it's possible she's the entire reason the kids are so badly behaved.  It's also possible the kids are just kids and your sister is projecting bad behaviors onto them.)  He's already lied to her about the kids even existing - what else is he lying to her about?\n\nHer attitude is also not fair to those kids but since she already hates them, it's not worth pointing that out.", "ESH", "NTA. Hope your sister shows her true colors be for it gets to the I DO Part. Adult steps have feelings. She'll find things change real fast.", "NTA. She is absolutely delusional to think that once the kids turn 18 that they\u2019ll be gone. That\u2019s it at all how parenting works.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a 13 year old girl making plans to marry a boy bander. You've said your piece. Let it go and let her do her thing.", "Yes, OP, YTA. What you did is pretty much the exact opposite of constructive criticism. Your sister is going to make her own life choices; all you can do is hope that she makes good ones and support her if they don't work out. If anything, your 'reality check' did nothing but make her double down.", "ESH, but you slightly more so \n\nYour sister's idea is terrible. And you could have told her that without going for the jugular. \n\nIt may be your job as a sibling to be honest. But I find most often that \"brutally honest\" is a code word for \"arsehole.\"", "I doubt it, the fact he hid his kids from her in order to date her is giving off shitty father who won't give a flying fuck that his gf hates his kids vibes.", "I hope you're right.", "As a stepmom very well said. When I read this I read it from the perspective of marrying a man that had a child. I would do nothing to harm my bonus daughter and treat her just like she is my own even after I gave birth to my daughter. I help pay bonus daughters rent for her off campus apartment. This is even knowing that my own daughter will be in college next fall. It\u2019s awful and disgusting behavior and it makes me angry.", "I feel like if I reach out to him, my sister would never forgive me. Like, that would be crossing a line that can't be uncrossed.", "Of course not", "Why would I want that to work out for her? Her plan is to banish those kids from their home the second they turn 18. I'd have to be completely heartless to hope that happens.", "Well, if she is right, we'll definitely have something to fight about.", "The kids might suffer because of it though", "Yeah, you're right. I put her on the defensive, and now she's not going to want to listen to anything I have to say on the topic.", "I'm glad there are people like you that treat kids like human beings instead of inconveniences. Restores a little bit of my faith in humanity.", "But those kids will be harmed forever if you don\u2019t. 4 kids wounded emotionally by what your sister is trying to do. And what she wants for the youngest child is abusive. It will cross an uncrossable line, no doubt, but it would be the right thing. At least I think. You\u2019ve heard how harmful she\u2019s talks. I\u2019m a parent. I would hope someone would tell me when someone means evil for my kiddos.", "Then I would suggest you tell your sister to ask her boyfriend about her plan.  No decent parent is going to be on board with that.  He can end the relationship since he will learn she see them as annoying and 1 as a babysitter for her future child.  The problem will solve itself.", "Oops, I forgot to mark that as sarcasm... sorry about that.", "You see no issue with someone's significant other hating their children?", "Why though? If she\u2019s right, she\u2019ll be dating him for a few years and will eventually be happy with him moving into the home? I wasn\u2019t implying she was right about the insults, but neither were you. But it seems to me that as long as she\u2019s communicating with her partner, there aren\u2019t any issues with the relationship. \n\nCompromise is needed, and she\u2019s doing what she thinks is best to stay with someone she seems to be happy with. At least, that\u2019s what I got from the info you provided.", "Does your other family members know about this grand plan? OP are you a mom? Just wondering because you have such a keen sensitivity to the children.", "I want to believe that the dad will pick up on her intentions before any harm is done without me needing to permanently sabotage my relationship with my sister. Is that naive?", "Ohhhh. Sorry. Hard to read tone in text.", "I see a massive issue with it. That's why, even if she is right, we'll definitely still fight about the topic. I don't think it's right for her to plan to estrange this man from his children. It's gross.", "So what if she'll be happy? Why is that worth ruining a man's relationship with his children? Four people have to suffer so she can be happy?", "I don't think so. My mom and sister currently aren't talking. My dad isn't really someone you talk about relationships with. No, I don't have children. I'm only 24 and single. I hope to one day, as I very much love children.", "Oh OP, I want to tell you no because I absolutely want to see the best in people too, but yes. It\u2019s very naive. You\u2019re in such a tough spot!! There is no good solution. If you\u2019re any sort of praying person, I\u2019d say pray about it. Can you talk to your parents in private about it and maybe grab some advice from them? Obvi only if they\u2019re safe to talk to. I\u2019m so sorry \ud83e\udd7a\u2665\ufe0f", "It's too hopeful and not very realistic, as she's deceptively hiding it from him - and perhaps even pretending to **like** his kids.\n\nWe don't - and shouldn't - assume that people are lying to us, so he has no idea she's a two-faced evil, and thus he isn't able to protect his children.", "No, no, that was my fault.", "Sorry that was meant for the other individual, not you", "I might have missed the part where she\u2019s trying to ruin his relationship with them. When did that happen? When she purposely made it so that she wouldn\u2019t intervene in their lives as a \u201cstand-in\u201d mother to teenagers?\n\nEither you left out some very important context of her trying to turn him against his children, or it isn\u2019t happening. In fact, the narrative you proposed puts forth the opposite impression. That she\u2019s being careful to not let her dislike for his kids interfere with His relationship with them. \n\nAll things considered, she\u2019s doing a LOT better of a job than most people would in her situation. There are tons of horror stories of parents bringing in a partner that try to weasel the children out of the favored eye and she doesn\u2019t seem to be doing that. I don\u2019t see any problems with what she\u2019s doing.", "I don't really want to gossip about her to our parents. That feels like trying to pit them against each other.", "You're the third person to say so. I guess I have a moral obligation to reach out to him. This won't be fun.", "That makes sense", "Did you read the post?", "Your sister could (and should) tell him herself - does she really want to be honest with you, but not with him?\n\nThey can still visit each other, when his children are in their mother's home, so they don't have to break up.", "A couple of times. I stand by what I said. Nowhere in that does it show that she\u2019s trying to wedge between them. Expect maybe the comment about the \u201cleast annoying\u201d one. But that doesn\u2019t really seem like she\u2019s trying to make Him like his kids less. Just that she has a least disliked of them. \n\nHonestly, the only vibes I\u2019ve gotten from the post is that for some reason you seem to have an extreme distaste  for either the guy your sister is dating, or your sister. Like I said. If you left out some context about how she\u2019s trying to turn him against his kids, please provide it. But the more the thread goes on the more I\u2019m leaning towards YTA.", "So you don't think trying to force your SO to kick his own kids out of their own home is like... in any way messed up? You do know most kids haven't even graduated high school yet when they turn 18, right?", "Is that what she\u2019s doing? Because if so you explained it poorly. \n\n\u201cShe said she is going going to keep dating him until the three older kids are out of the house, and then she will move in with him.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t saying she\u2019s pressuring him into kicking them out on their 18th birthday. It isn\u2019t saying she\u2019s even forcing him to kick them out. You literally said she would wait for them to move out. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that IF she was forcing him to kick his kids out and turn him against them she wouldn\u2019t be in the wrong. But the picture that YOU painted doesn\u2019t tell that narrative. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just a lack of explaining what happened in the conversation or your anger at her, but what you\u2019re saying she\u2019s doing, and what you said she said are two very different things. \n\nAll I see is a woman being patient and waiting to make a deeper commitment with someone she loves as to avoid problems. And a few years is a long time for things to happen. Especially considering how new the relationship is. \n\nMy issue right now isn\u2019t with your perspective. It\u2019s that you\u2019re not providing the necessary context to explain WHY you think she\u2019s doing something, when you explain that she\u2019s planning to do the opposite.", "She literally said when they turn 18 legally he won't be responsible for them anymore and they'll be out of the house. Hence the whole, only having to deal with the younger one (the \"least annoying\") a couple of years, because she's three years younger than the next youngest kid.", "The sister stated that she \u201chates\u201d his kids. Hate is a very strong word. Also it seems as if she is just tolerating being around his kids. It\u2019s nasty and disgusting behavior. Trust me, I\u2019ve been in the situation of a partner with children. Her attitude is all wrong. To say she is being patient is not even close to what the heck is going on here. Make no mistake this will fall apart very quickly. When it comes to children and teens they are very perceptive. They will feel that hatred and her just tolerating them. Because of that they will stay away from dad. He will end up resenting her at the end of it all. Let\u2019s be clear she never wanted to date a man with kids and here she is. Then she wants to use the youngest as a baby sitter. Smh", "ESH. I hate that you're using mental illness terms to abuse her. She needs to think things through and respect that the BF'a children are part of the package.", "Your sister is an idiot but it's not your job to give her anything.", "The name calling may have been too much but still NTA. She\u2019s awful just by planning around the kids leaving, like they\u2019re going to move to a different planet and the youngest becoming the babysitter!! Her entitlement has no limits. I understand your frustration.", "NTA good god not the asshole. But you\u2019ve said your piece now. Allow her to destroy her life if that\u2019s what she\u2019s committed to doing. I think we all know precisely how this will end.", "NTA tbh like yeah it was mean but she had it comin", "i 100% agree you know in like 6 months well be reading a reddit post from one of those teens", "Do not get involved yet. Your sister and this guy aren't moving in together anytime soon. See if the relationship with his kids get better. If she remains two faced and toxic and they plan to get serious then say something to him. This is new and hopefully they'll start seeing this isn't going to work.", "People change. My son told me he never wanted kids. He dated a woman who had a daughter. He started talking about how \u2018neat\u2019 the daughter was. He and the woman have now been married twenty years. Besides his step daughter, they have a daughter. He has two grandchildren. Life is good.", "She has very high expectations of her future in regard to when the teenagers would be moving out of their home.   My brothers dd not move out of our family tom until they got married.   They were both college graduates and employed.  One was 25 and one was 22.  My father was FURIOUS when I moved out as I was nt going into a marriage , I just wanted to be independent..  You were right to give your sister a reality check.  kt", "Yeah, let's love a woman who is going to abuse children until their relationship is ruined with their father. Stand by that woman, don't judge her, love everything she does, and never disagree with her, even while hurting children that don't deserve that.", "she is a delusional psycho tho", "If any of her vile nonsense is in a written format to you like text or email, please for the love of the kids involved screenshot and send it to him. He deserves to have the knowledge to protect his kids!\n\n\nNTA", "Honestly, from the sound of it, I don't think this guy would care even if he knew your sister will hate his kids. **Someone who has a lot of love and care for his childrens' wellbeing would not hide their existence in order to date someone who doesn't want children.** He sounds like as much of a shit human being as your sister, and those poor kids are the ones who will suffer from indifferent, uncaring adults.", "Judging and condoning are two distinctly different concepts.", "Please, you know how people feel about children on reddit, they don't care. As long as an adult woman can act how she wants without restriction, that's all they care about.", "Be prepared for him not to listen to you, or not to care what your sister said, but can you live with yourself if you know the abuse your sister will be dishing out to get his kids and him to not have a relationship? It will be shitty to have to watch that, and you said nothing to try and stop it.", "NTA and you need to tell the dad what she said.", "NTA I'd be letting the bf know because there is children involved and are at risk of being abused.", "Also why was she meeting the kids after a few months?", "Ah yes, it's perfectly fine to hate your SO's kids to the point you force them to move out at 18, then you make the youngest babysit for you. Yeah let's just ruin this man's relationship with his children for the vibes.", "This guy isn't good for her or the kids either. My dad raised me as a single parent. He told all his girlfriends about me within the first couple of dates (they usually sent home presents for me with him).  That this guy waited so long to mention the kids to your sister does not speak well of him at all.", "My dad married this absolute nightmare of the woman who demands I help with the new baby but she won't even let my older siblings visit...practically writes itself.", "No. Don't. \n\nOdds are this relationship will fail within the year.  However, even if it doesn't, she's not going to move in until the older children are out. You have literally years to wait for this relationship to crumble on its own. \n\nYou don't need to do anything until then.", "Chances are his next step will be to have her stay with the teens while he goes out of down for a week.", "I wonder if the guy will care.  He kept the kids\u2019 existence secret for six weeks.  I agree that he definitely needs to be told though."]}
