A little quirk I have is being able to recognize songs quickly. I've just always known a lot of songs, and learning lyrics is something I enjoy. We were chatting with a few people I hadn't met till that night and multiple times songs had come on that I liked so I sang along to them. \n\nMy close friend, as a joke, said \"You literally know every song.\" To which I replied \"Yeah I literally know every single song in the world I can't lie.\" I said it in a fake-arrogant way.   \n\n\nSome random dude in the group heard me and started trying to challenge me on it. He started saying stuff like \"No you don't, that's impossible!\" He then went to his Spotify to bring up songs to test me. He got weirdly passionate/aggro about it.\n\n  \nI really didn't think it was that serious so I deadpanned \"I'm obviously joking.\" I got a few laughs from the group, and I guess he got embarrassed and went silent for the rest of the night. I heard from a few mutual friends that he thought I was a b word. \n\nSo am I reddit?", "created_utc": 1698433711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17huyz2/aita_for_making_fun_of_a_guy/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He overheard a comment you made and thought that it was his place in the world to prove you wrong. Your comment was the appropriate response.", "NTA, and like you said, it's some random dude that you don't know. I wouldn't even interact with a random dude either.", "NTA dude sounds unstable. Overly literal and unable to take criticism... who cares what he thinks?", "NTA-  As we can clearly see, drunk and stupid doesn't get the girl! He sounds kind of mentally touched one way or another.", "NTA.  This dude needs to check his ego.", "No, he's an idiot.", "NTA, but now that you know a little more about how easy it is for someone to misunderstand context and get embarrassed, you can decide whether you want to handle it the same way or a different way in case it happens again.", "ESH.", "ESH.
