My family were hardly supportive, even got angry at the idea, even though I told them I was taking part for the above reason.

There are a lot of diploma programs that are 1-2 years that could be a better fit sometimes in terms of what that student ultimately wants to do. \n\nHowever, in an ideal world - postsecondary education should be about further exploration of your interests without the fear of racking up debt.

As a young high school graduate my plan was to become a teacher but I did not fully understand both how little a teacher makes and the insane amount of stress and expectations a teacher is under. Before you fund anything you and your niece need to sit down and have several discussions about what she is going to do with a history degree (the two main options are teaching or getting a masters but probably a PHD and being an academic). Once she thinks she has a plan for what she is going to do career wise you guys then need to compare beginning salary vs cost of living. My first teaching job was in the 10/11 school year. I made 26,000 for the year. I was paid once a month and after taxes and retirement and insurance I had like 1200 for the month to live on. If your niece was my daughter I would be encouraging her to explore other majors that fit her interests and got for a minor in history or even a double major if she is studious.

It seems that you plan on paying for the degree, do plan on paying for their other kids degree? Maybe sharing this piece would be useful information. \n\nFYI my daughter wants to be a teacher. I support her decision in doing so. We have the ability to pay for her to attend a local college and graduate debt free. She has interests in going off to college to have the experience. I am absolutely trying to discourage her doing so, because I know how challenging it will be for her to life comfortably with student loans while being paid a teacher\u2019s salary.

Not everyone needs to make a ton of money to be happy, but you just dont want her to struggle.", "First, NTA. \n\nThere are two sides to this story. There are a great many degrees that are totally unmarketable, yet expensive. People get into serious debt, only to find that they cannot find a job related to their degree. Then they get low paying jobs they could have gotten out of high school, struggling to pay off student loans the size of a mortgage. This has become so common that it\u2019s a driving force in the demand for student loan forgiveness. People want to be able to major in surfing studies or erotica, for fun, but have taxpayers pay for it because they can\u2019t get a job. Someone only has total freedom to study what they love if they either have a career path, or are independently wealthy.\n\nOn the other hand, students forced into a major they don\u2019t enjoy tend to struggle with bad grades, and end up working in a field they loathe.\n\nI think it would be wise if she maps out various career options with the history degree, as part of preparing for college. She needs to decide what careers interest her, to determine if she\u2019ll need a masters or PhD. History degrees are useful if she wants to become a teacher, a writer of historical fiction, run a history YouTube channel that either teaches history or discusses inaccuracies in movies, or get into politics, among other options. Just as there is no point in students majoring in a field they dislike, which prepares them for a career they will dislike, she has to have interest in a career path that will be open to her with a history degree. She also needs to research the job market in her chosen career. Is her perfect job common, or hard to find? Will she need a Masters degree to start on that career, and if so, will she have funding?\n\nHer parents are worried she will get into debt and waste her time in college getting her a degree that will make her unmarketable in finding a job. They are forward looking. Teenagers tend to exist in the present and not think about if they can get a good-paying job with that degree. \n\nA degree in history is one of the classics. While it\u2019s not as marketable as a degree in law or medicine, it is not a fluff degree. My son\u2019s favorite teacher is his history teacher. History had always seemed dull, but this teacher is a young, recent graduate who makes history fascinating. Perhaps this will be her role, too.\n\nAs long as she researches the jobs a history degree will qualify her for, and is still interested, then she should go for it.", "I wanted to do a history degree. Instead, fearful of what my (banker) parents would think, and too chicken to face their judgment, I spent four years doing a business / commerce degree that I did well in (first class honours)  but never enjoyed. It was clear to me, by the time I finished it, that I would make a terrible business person, so I ended up going overseas for a bit to teach English. Enjoyed teaching, came back to my home country and did a post-grad education diploma, and I've been a high school teacher for the past 20 years. It turns out the history degree would have been much more relevant and useful to me! Wish I'd had the guts as a 17-year-old to do what I wanted, and that I'd had a relative like you, OP, to back me up.

It was pretty much assumed that she would be a veterinarian and she went to a school that her parents paid for and she was a veterinarian for like 5 or 7 years. I met her after she quit being a veterinarian, to be a farmer. Her income is cut in half, but she does not regret it one bit. She loves every bit of what she does and she is taking classes to learn more about agriculture.\n\nSo had her parents allowed her to get whatever degree she wanted in the beginning she wouldn't have wasted a dozen years of her life and still paying for college.

Usually it's a combination of those two things. Universities tend to do a terrible job setting their non-STEM students up for success. They make it seem like you get your degree and a job will just magically manifest alongside your diploma.\n\nYou are NTA, but discuss career goals with your niece *now*.

Over the decades I've been teaching and advising students, I can't even count how many have come to my office in tears about what they're being forced to study (or not study) because their parents are convinced that certain majors have a better ROI than others.\n\nI'm here to tell you that most college graduates do NOT work in the area they majored in.   That's because the point of college is (contrary to popular opinion) NOT career training.  It's learning about the world, and learning how to think critically, and learning how to deal with other people.  And you can gain those skills in ANY major. \n\nSure, if a student has a specific career track they know they want, then they should follow that path.  And that path might even be trade school instead of college!  But most students arrive at university not yet knowing what they love, not yet knowing what really interests them.  They're in college to find out.  And that's a gift.\n\nAlso, many of the jobs out there are not things that have an associated college major!  The folks I went to college with are doing all kinds of things, many of which are jobs that I didn't even know existed when I was in school.  \n\nYou know how many folks found their career fields?  Internships and the networking that provides.  I think most college students should get an internship job of some kind. But my opinion and five bucks will get you a cup of coffee. \n\nTLDR: Encourage college-age students to explore and find out what they love, and let them major in whatever the hell that is.  At the same time, be practical, and encourage them to do an internship at some point while they're in school; summer internships can be super helpful to launch a career.", "Yta.

I wasted getting my first BA in history. I went back, got a better degree and then grad school. My history degree isn\u2019t even on my resume. I got nowhere with it. I have a career in the mid six figures and it was not due to history. \n\nCollege is not about pursuing interests. If it was then loans wouldn\u2019t come knocking 6 months after you finish.

Instead (if) they graduated with six figure debt and they are fighting behind English and History majors to get those same job were a 2.0 with a Chemistry degree does not impress anyone because no one cares about a STEM degree more outside of a STEM field, and most STEM fields are not the place anyone trusts the \u201cCs get Degrees\u201d mentally.", "That boy made a decision not his parents fault .", "It\u2019s amazing how much people overlook the sheer number of jobs that involve careful reading, writing, art, etc. Almost every major company and institution is constantly churning out massive amounts of writing.
