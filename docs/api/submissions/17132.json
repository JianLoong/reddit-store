They want her to get a degree that will lead to good job opportunities, like science or engineering. \n\nI make mid to high 6 figures and am a single father (widower) to one daughter (15). I also am a big believer of doing what you love because life is short. I told Ella that if she can\u2019t get a scholarship, I\u2019ll provide her with financial aid during university and she can pay me back whenever. She\u2019s now working on her early admissions and is doing volunteer work while cutting her usual summer job hours at the local amusement park in half.\n\nMy niece\u2019s parents called me a huge AH for doing this. They said I don\u2019t understand their struggle. My BIL studied liberal arts and works as an HR in a medium-sized company and my sister has an associate degree and is currently a manager at a chain restaurant. They are doing OK but they are not comfortable.\n\nThey said the only reason I get to throw my money around is because I\u2019m an engineer and my late wife was a pharmacist.

They said if I thought a degree that won\u2019t make money is so great, maybe I should pull my daughter out of the gifted science program she\u2019s in at her school.\n\nI told them I know plenty of people who studied various different degrees that are successful, but they said the successful ones are far in between. They also said they don\u2019t want Ella to set a bad example for her brother Ben (14) who expressed interests in being a veterinarian.\n\nI told them I\u2018ll support Ella\u2019s decision no matter what and if she\u2019s doing what makes her happy that shouldn\u2019t be a bad example and Ben is too young to settle his mind on anything. I then threw them out of my house. Still, I wonder if I\u2019m the AH here.\n\nEdit: I only said for her to pay me back only to make sure she doesn\u2019t waste her opportunities.

Your nieces parents are understandably concerned about her future. However they are using their life experiences to try to force your niece onto a path they wish they had taken. But it's a path she doesn't want to take. Her dreams ARE important. It is extremely generous of you to do what you are doing. Stick to your guns.", "NTA BUT I would highly recommend pushing her to start having meetings with advisors, career planners, etc. I did a history degree and am now doing a PhD in history and the job market is\u2026tough, to say the least, if you want to actually use the degree. She should absolutely choose the major she wants, especially if she just wants to have a degree and not necessarily go into the field, but she should also be prepared for the realities of doing a liberal arts degree.", "NTA.  You're being the supportive figure she needs and deserves her parents to be.", "NTA. Your brother and sister need to stop blaming their degree choices on their careers and earnings. I did an English degree and now in my 30s currently earn 50k (which in the UK is not at all bad). A history degree would not be at all useless; she will gain a lot of skills from this, and the fact that she is already working so hard towards this strongly suggests she could be one of the successful graduates.", "NTA, your niece is still young and definitely needs someone to support her. You are doing the right thing. It's a pity that her parents don't want to support her dreams. If her dream doesn\u2019t work out, she can always try something else in the future, without getting punished in the future by wondering 'what if...?'", "NTA, I know lots of people who studied liberal arts in undergrad then went on to do law school after or teaching. If your niece is pushed into a career without the passion it will  only set her up for failure.\n\nYou are absolutely disrespecting your sister\u2019s wishes though. Spend some time guiding your sister in the right direction. Otherwise, Ella will be caught in the middle.", "NTA.\n\nI can't shake the thought that they're counting on a \"successful\" daughter to provide their retirement.\n\nAnd if the son can be dissuaded from becoming a DVM because his sister majored in history, he hasn't got the commitment needed to get through vet school.", "NTA. Just because a degree doesn't have a career in its name doesn't make it useless. There are many careers that can come from a history degree and Ella's parents are being short-sighted. Her getting this degree has nothing to do with Ben's chosen career path (although in the coming years before high school graduation he might change his mind on his own).", "NTA. It is very hard to accurately predict the future and the job market, and while they can talk to their daughter about their experiences and potential hardships she may face, they should let her make her decision at the end. You are doing something great for your niece.", "NTA. A history degree is hardly useless. Teaching, writing, working in a museum, and many many other things are good career choices with a history degree. But aside from that, any college degree is a good college degree. Just because you've got a degree in history doesn't mean you have to go into something that relies on it for your career choice. Many jobs just want you to have some kind of a degree, I guess to prove that you're an adult.", "NTA. It\u2019s fair for the parents to be concerned, but they made their choices, your niece has the right to make hers, and she should do whatever she wants to do.", "NTA.

She needs that, given the unsupportive parents she has.", "I get where the parents are coming from as they don\u2019t want her to be in/under employee with a history degree living with them.  However their view is myopic:   If she were forced to get a degree she\u2019s not interested in, she would underperform and not necessarily pursue a career in those fields.  Also, I can\u2019t count the people with good careers that have an unrelated degree.  NTA\nPS:  are you adopting any middle age men?  I want a BFA in photography \ud83d\ude01", "NTA, but your sister and her husband are absolute morons if they think veterinarians are in it for the cash. \n\nVet school is *incredibly* expensive and vets make very little money, unless they're either microdosing rich people's Chihuahuas with LSD or artificially inseminating race horses in Dubai.", "NTA. As a pretty successfully individual at a large consulting firm who *gasp* graduated with a Russian & Eurasian Studies Degree I agree with the focus of following your interests. I also really appreciate your edit. My uncle lent me money so I could go to the school of my choice and when I reached out after graduation to discuss repayment he told me it was a gift. I will forever be grateful to him.", "Well, NTA if you make it clear to them NOW that it's a gift. Otherwise you're asking parents to sit by while they believe that you're putting a 17 year old into significant debt. There's a reason 17 year olds aren't allowed to sign for loans and no good parent would sit by and watch that train wreck.\n\nYour gift is absolutely lovely and beautifully intentioned. Just make it clear now, to everyone, that it's a gift. You can always tie to her keeping up her GPA.", "NTA I have an English lit degree and work for the single most profitable company in the world, which happens to be in tech.

I can\u2019t even begin to count how many of our coworkers can also say the same. There\u2019s no reason to assume that a non-STEM degree means low income earning potential. It\u2019s understandable that they\u2019re worried and want her to do well, but their fears are misplaced. She can make as much or as little of whatever degree she decides to do, and ultimately you\u2019re right; life is too short not to do something you love if you have the opportunity to.", "NTA\n\nYour niece makes this choice with first-hand experience of living on relatively low income. She's not a delusional girl who thinks history degree guarantees a six-figure salary. As long as she understands and accepts consequences, she deserves to make this decision.", "NTA and what a nice thing to do! Let me tell you my story just to further prove NTA- I was initially a pre vet major in college because my parents also pushed me to do something that would make good money, and I love animals. However I ended up being miserable in my science classes all day when my real passion was creative endeavors like English and marketing. I ended up bouncing around degrees and it took me 8 years to graduate college as a result. I\u2019m happy with the degree I got but wish I had pursued it from the gecko.

They are absolutely correct that you are financially comfortable because you made practical choices and they are not because they did not. Guess what? I had to go back to school in my thirties to undo the fantastical decisions I made the first time around. If her degree doesn't work out, are you also prepared to financially support her?
