Have you asked her what career path she plans on taking with a history degree? I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s something specific she\u2019s aiming for, or if she\u2019s just really into history. That could also play a part in her parent\u2019s reasoning. \n\nI suggest everyone sit down and talk about it.

If you want to spend your money to help your niece pursue a passion, that is an amazing thing to do.\n\nAnd her parents are also correct, that picking a major that is not as marketable as so many others will place a lot of obstacles in her path that could be avoided.\n\nBut this falls right into my personal idea of college. If you want to self pay, study whatever you want. If you are going to take out loans, then they should be given out based on risk and ability to pay them back, like every single other loan. And not used solely to fund a passion and non study related purchases.", "Lots of people are focusing on her wanting to do history being valid - it was my major too so I empathise. However, I dont feel enough people are pointing out that enrolling into a science programme you aren't 100% enthusiastic and committed to is subjecting yourself to years of misery and no desire to get a job in the field. Following your passion doesn't always pay well but doing STEM for the money when others are in it because they enjoy it will leave you trapped in at best middling roles that you hate, if you dont swap fields", "My brother did a history degree and then did masters in museum studies.

My family were hardly supportive, even got angry at the idea, even though I told them I was taking part for the above reason.

I didn't pursue anything in the end.\n\n\nAnyway, my point is, at least she has something she wants to do.

I do say to my students who want to do a degree - \"and what is your plan for after?\" Because it can be harder than a degree that has more of a clear path to a job. I want them to at least be thinking about what their endgame is before they take on debt because university has been pushed as the be all and end all, but the reality is sometimes it's not the right fit. There are a lot of diploma programs that are 1-2 years that could be a better fit sometimes in terms of what that student ultimately wants to do. \n\nHowever, in an ideal world - postsecondary education should be about further exploration of your interests without the fear of racking up debt.

As a young high school graduate my plan was to become a teacher but I did not fully understand both how little a teacher makes and the insane amount of stress and expectations a teacher is under. Before you fund anything you and your niece need to sit down and have several discussions about what she is going to do with a history degree (the two main options are teaching or getting a masters but probably a PHD and being an academic). Once she thinks she has a plan for what she is going to do career wise you guys then need to compare beginning salary vs cost of living. My first teaching job was in the 10/11 school year. I made 26,000 for the year. I was paid once a month and after taxes and retirement and insurance I had like 1200 for the month to live on. If your niece was my daughter I would be encouraging her to explore other majors that fit her interests and got for a minor in history or even a double major if she is studious. The liberal arts are super important to who we are as people and our society but the reality is that most liberal arts degrees do not pay well in our current society and that is something to be mindful of for someone who is looking to set themselves up in the working world for the next fifty years.", "NTA and not just because I think more young people need to study history.

It seems that you plan on paying for the degree, do plan on paying for their other kids degree? Maybe sharing this piece would be useful information. \n\nFYI my daughter wants to be a teacher. I support her decision in doing so. We have the ability to pay for her to attend a local college and graduate debt free. She has interests in going off to college to have the experience. I am absolutely trying to discourage her doing so, because I know how challenging it will be for her to life comfortably with student loans while being paid a teacher\u2019s salary.

It wasn't true 30 years ago and it still isn't.\n\nI work in engineering.  I'm not hiring history majors.

I agree with you, the degree should just be what you're interested in. I just disagree that OP should tell the parents that according to strangers on Reddit, it's a fine choice", "Do you know different places have different costs of living, right? What would be about 500 USD a month lets me live pretty comfortably and put some into savings, because I live in a pretty cheap country", "The pound is pretty low these days thanks to brexit", "I was speaking as a partner in a large accounting firm rather than some random Redditor but okay", "Nobody can possibly verify that..."]}
