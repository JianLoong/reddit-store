Very few good schools offer \"liberal arts\" as a standalone undergrad major (except in conjunction with an teaching license for elementary students) and if the bil got a weirdly broad liberal arts  only degree from a scammy online school, that's fairly different from a history degree from a well respected university (especially if graduate school is something she is considering).

One of my fellow students made it his goal to work for the History Network. There are also jobs for historians for the government - not only writing histories, but working for the Parks as many national parks have staff historians - but again, many want advanced degrees. Generally, historians have to write it down at some point, so writing skills are very important.

Also economics and psychology are both liberal arts degrees that have great career opportunities (historically most sciences have also fallen under the liberal arts category though I understand most people don't use liberal arts to mean chemistry these days... I'm coming at this from the perspective of a school that has very few undergrad degree programs outside of the school of liberal arts and sciences and it is always wild to me when ppl insist that undergrad degrees in communications or business are the best.
