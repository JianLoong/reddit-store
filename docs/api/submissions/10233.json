If you\u2019re uncomfortable then bow out. ((Hugs)) from an internet stranger!", "NTA\nYou have no obligation to be in the bridal party. Thank her for the invite, but say you just can\u2019t do it. If she blows up over it, no loss. Like you said, a friend wouldn\u2019t  be so callous about your feelings.", "NTA.\n\nTell her as gracefully as you can \"I'm uncomfortable with the dress, and that's an end to it.  But I'll be there, just not as a brides-maid, because it's your day and I love you and will support you one hundred percent from the Bride's Side.\"", "Wow, who is she to decide that you should be ready for this? Definitely NTA, and yes, get out of the wedding. This is not a friend, this is a very shallow someone who just wants the pretty pictures.", "NTA. Just because it\u2019s her wedding does not mean it\u2019s okay to make you feel uncomfortable.  I would also reevaluate this \u201cfriendship\u201d as I question someone who would be so inconsiderate, especially considering your recent mastectomy.", "NTA - I think it\u2019s really unfair she would put you in that position. It\u2019s up to you decide how much of your body you show and when. There are so many beautiful styles of bridesmaids dresses to choose from that you would feel comfortable in.", "NTA at all. She has no right to tell you how you should feel. She's completely inconsiderate.", "NTA \n\nThat bride is an appalling friend. Holy shit.", "NTA. I am so sorry your friend is so insensitive.", "NTA, and honestly, f her for telling you how you should feel about your breast cancer and mastectomy. If the thing she is demanding you wear makes you uncomfortable, then tell her you'd prefer to be a comfortable guest and let someone else wear the strapless dress. She's totally out of line and I'm really sorry she's treating you this way.", "NTA It takes time to accept scars. It's your timeline, it's all about your pace. It's been a little over three years since I have facial reconstructive surgery and there are still many days I'm happy to still wear a mask. On another note, strapless sounds painful on fresh scars. I wouldn't do it just for that reason alone, no matter how I felt about my scars. Plus exposure to UV causes scar darkening so covering up is better on the long run. Constant sunscreen application is a necessity.", "NTA\n\nShe should be proud and embrace *you* instead of pressuring you into (I'm going to guess here) making all of her wedding photos match.", ">\tsays \u201cI should be proud and embrace my scars and lack of breasts\u201d \n\nShe absolutely does not get to tell you this\u2014you\u2019re entitled to feel however you want! I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re in this position, OP. You\u2019re NTA for not wanting to wear something you wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable in but I\u2019m not sure what option you have if the bride is resolute on her bridesmaids wearing a strapless dress?", "NTA. It\u2019s your body and your experience. She doesn\u2019t get to tell you how you should feel", "NTA after going through cancer and a mastectomy you do whatever makes you comfortable.", "NTA. Your friend may just be trying to be supportive and encourage you to not be self-conscious but you have a right to your comfort level. Maybe a shawl or shrug to cover it could be a compromise.", "Yes it's her wedding but a good friend would be considerate of the situation and help find an alternative for you.\n\nI do agree that you should embrace your battle scars for your victory for beating breast cancer.... but ONLY when you feel comfortable with it.\n\nCongratulations for beating it.\n\nNTA.", "What a self absorbed AH of a\"friend\". Who is she to dictate when you should feel ok showing your scars .. if you ever are. \n\nJust tell her no thanks to being in her wedding. I'd just send a token gift and not even go personally. That's next level atrocious behavior on her part\n\nNTA", "NTA. \nI would perhaps speak to her once more about how you feel about it and if she still tries to tell you how you should feel, rather than being a decent friend and try to understand and make adjustments so you can feel good, then I'd tell her then and there that you'll be stepping down from being a bridesmaid. \n\nI'd hope she can be an understanding friend. But the fact she has already told you how she thinks you should embrace it, rather than taking you seriously and listening to how you feel and try to make more comfortable, then I'm sorry to say the likelihood is it may end the friendship. \n\nIf your feelings aren't important to her then she isn't a friend worth having.", "NTA. Normally I would say the bride has right of choice for the dresses, but not today. She has no right to tell you how to feel about your surgery and to make you feel uncomfortable to attend her wedding. Stay strong and all the best for your recovery.", "This is the opposite energy of the BM who wants to wear a bare midriff dress to her modest friend's wedding.\n\nTHIS is a reason to argue against a dress, THIS is a reason to compromise.\n\nCan she allow you to add spaghetti straps for support and let you wear a wrap/shawl/bolero in a complementary fabric? Like chiffon or a pretty lace? If covering chest scars is the issue, what about a heavily bangled necklace? \n\nDoes the dress store have in-house alterations you can consult with?\n\nA thousand times  NTA ! Fight for a compromise, but stand your ground. Don't rule out dropping out.\n\nETA a simple solution:\n[a chiffon shawl draped like so](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51j+ZjqpcEL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_FMwebp_.jpg)", "NTA. That isn\u2019t a friend. How disappointing and unsettling.", "Oh hell no. Drop out. That bride is no friend of yours. How cruel of her to have no sympathy for someone she considers such a close friend. You and you alone get to decide how you feel about your scars. You went through something and nobody dictates how you feel about it. NTA", "Life's way too short to put up with that. \n\n\n\nBe kind, but firm and let her know that regardless of what she thinks you should feel, you don't feel that way and you'd rather not be uncomfortable, so you'd prefer to simply support her as a guest and remove yourself from the wedding party. \n\n\n\nFrame it around being as supportive as you can for her and wanting to not be distracting from the esthetics of her day, because you won't be able to wear the dress without covering up or having a different style.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely NTA", "nta - your friend should be grateful your alive to see her get married!", "NTA and she honestly sounds toxic (which is a word I hate to use because of how much it's thrown around willy nilly). I'm worried she would intentionally want you in a dress that brings attention to your scars and your figure that you are still working on accepting so that she can look \"better\" by comparison. Yuck.", "NTA. Bridezilla strikes again. If she's being that stubborn I would either bow out of the bridal party or not go at all. Which might end up happening when she throws a hissy fit over not getting her way. How could she demand you wear a dress that is definitely going to make you uncomfortable? Is she trying to make a spectacle of you? Or trying to make you feel less than? Because it sure sounds like it to me.", "Oh my heavens, will the Bridezilla curse ever end?\n\nYou do what makes you comfortable and nothing else.  NTA", "NTA.  Someone who wants to put you in this situation doesn't deserve your presence at their wedding or in their life.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve had a double mastectomy as well. \n\nYour body is still yours. Covering or not covering is your choice alone.\n\nI would politely drop out.\n\n\nGood luck with your reconstruction. I went with DIEP for mine. If you have any questions I\u2019m happy to answer them.", "Nta", "NTA, what a horrible friend she is.", "Normally I would say bridesmaids should go along with the dress code of the wedding, but this is one of those exceptions where the bride is in the wrong. It's not the bride's place to dictate how you should feel about your mastectomy. You're also not a performing seal for her to show off on the day. If she was anyway decent she would have asked if there was a particular style of dress that would be most comfortable for you, or suggested a few styles and asked you to choose.  NTA.", "NAH.

While some women may find it empowering to flaunt their scars, many feel shame, anger, and/or resentment, and should not be forced to wear anything they are uncomfortable in.
