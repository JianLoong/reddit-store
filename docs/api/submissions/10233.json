Her friend is a 1st class Bi*ch. Between the BMX, chemo, and whatever other treatment OP has to go thru, NO ONE should be telling her to do anything or how to feel. \n\nNo one fully understands what it is to go thru a massive surgery and cancer treatments unless they have been thru it themselves. I worked in healthcare for 25+ years with 100s of cancer patients and still had no clue what it was going to be like for me.\n\nOP,  if you like the dress but are worried that it won't stay up, they make strapless mastectomy bras (with inserts). If you just aren't ready for dressing up like that yet... That's ok, too. Recovery takes a long time. Like I said, it's been 4 years, and I'm still learning to embrace the new me.  If you need someone to talk to, you can message me. \n\nNTA, but your \"friend\" is a MASSIVE one.", "Yeah, NTA, and hugs from me as well", "Yes! A good friend would help their friend work to find a dress that she felt comfortable in. You are getting used to a big change. Don\u2019t feel bad about bowing out.", " I personally would back out of attending at all if she didnt back off. It's a matter of respect.", "She would probably need a strapless mastectomy bra with inserts in order for the strapless dress to be held up into place.  I'm not sure how comfortable they are, but I have seen them at the \"cancer spa\" in my area. They aren't too high in price. Another thing to consider is if she has expanders placed. Those things are like having big, bulky, square-ish inflatable blocks on your chest. These can be really uncomfortable if a bra rubs the edges of them the wrong way. People like OPs friend really have no clue whatsoever about all the crud breast cancer patients go thru just to survive and to be able to look at ourselves in the mirror again without being shocked about how we look.\n\nEdit: the shawl is a good idea if OP is comfortable in a strapless dress. Good idea!", "Eh, when you agree to being a bridesmaid you're agreeing to be a part of the brides vision. If they want the same dress then it's the same dress, if they want the same color but different dress the it's that. \n\nAt the same time if someone is uncomfortable with that  decis then they have every right to step down and no hard feelings to be made. \n\nThe bride isn't the asshole for wanting the dress choice bit she is the asshole with that battle scars \"compliment\".", "Fair enough. It's easy to take sides when you don't personally know either party. I'd say OP probably wants to remain friends despite how bad this looks right now. But damn, you should let your recent cancer-surviving friend with body image issues wear a slightly customized dress if it means feeling comfortable.", "You could let people add sleeves or wear shawls/shrugs. It's actually a really nice and elegant solution. If you get a dress hemmed, it's easy to have the seamstress add straps.", "Completely agree.  A good bride is a gracious one who cares less about the photos than about the moment, so no argument from me.\n\nBut as she doesn\u2019t attend our Master Classes in Assholery here, she hasn\u2019t the benefit of our insight and all we have to work with is OP and her path forward.\n\nYou and I agree on far more than we disagree on!", "NTA. 2 months isn't enough time for you to decide to defiantly embrace scars.  Has she even seen what they look like?", "NTA - the bride telling you to \u201cembrace your scars and lack of breasts\u201d is the equivalent of telling you to get \u201cover it\u201d. Shame on her for her lack of empathy and sensitivity. She sounds like a terrible friend.", "NTA. Nobody would make me wear a strapless now and would be totally impossible if i was in your situation. She doesn\u2019t know how you feel and all that self acceptance thing happens when YOU are ready, not when she says.", "Friend is being a dick. Nta.", "The audacity to tell you what you should feel jesus christ", "NTA", "NTA. Tell her that you are NOT comfortable showing what the surgery left, and if she actually wants you at the wedding, you will not wear any kind of revealing dress! Your body, your comfort level.\n\nIf she values her fancy dress over your feelings and your being there, say goodby on the wedding.", "Not at all if you're uncomfy then they can't make you wear the dress", "NTA Why on earth would she want to force you to display scars from a life threatening condition? And then she tells you to be proud of it and show off your surgery scars??? Seriously wtf??? If she is adamant that you must do so in order to participate in her wedding then decline to participate. I would probably not even go as she seems like a thoughtless entitled person and not at all like a friend. seriously what the actual F????", " How about.. \"I decided to just show up topless! What better way to show off these awesome scars you seem so proud of.\" Seriously though, I would reconsider if that person is truly a friend or some kind of sadist.", "NTA.  She really needs to be more empathetic. As long as color matches what you want and frankly need should be okay. If not being in the wedding feels less traumatic and easier for you, then that's what you should do. You've been through and survived enough.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, I hope you're recovering well. Rooting for you.\n\nI think it's a very small ask to be allowed to wear a dress with sleeves. Also, I think it's quite cute (not boring) and practical to let each bridesmaid choose the style they want, the color and material just all have to be same.\n\nINFO: Who is paying for the dress?", "NTA. Have you sat down to talk with her about this? I mean a serious heart to heart. Open up about it and see what she says. If it comes down to it. Do what is best for you. Even if it means not being in the wedding.", "NTA\n\n\nYour friend doesn't get to decide how fast you mentally recover from something like that\n\n\nEdit to add: if you really want be a part of the wedding still and keep the bride as a friend you could tell her\n\n\n\"I really want to be there for you on this special day but I'm still grieving and processing what happened to me. I'm just not ready for something like that and if that's not okay with you then I need to step back from this. It's your wedding and it should be the way you want it.\"\n\n\nBut personally I don't know how I'd feel about a friend who isn't considerate of your feelings in that way", "NTA  Tell her that you just won't be comfortable and you want to celebrate her and be happy for her on her wedding but if you are in a strapless dress you will be feeling awkward and self concious and not able to focus on the happy celebration.  If she wants everyone matching then you would be happier to attend as a guest.", "NTA.\n\nYour friend sounds like a bridezilla. She values how her bridesmaids look over how her best friend feels?", "NTA.\n\nditch those toxic friends.", "If you were launching a campaign against a colour, even an ugly colour,  that would be unfair to the bride. Her day, her weird rainbow tartan dresses.\n\nBut NTA at all for not being able to comfortably wear strapless 2 months after ANY major surgery.", "NTA, but if you want some advice maybe say, you don\u2019t want to show off the scars, cuz then people will want to talk about them and you don\u2019t want to distract from the bride", "Exactly, its all right and good to advocate body positivity, even easier when you aren't the one suffering.", "yeah but as her friend she should also want her bridesmaids and friends to be comfortable", "So true re: 2mo post op.  Grieving is still occurring. Just asking OP to wear strapless dress is triggering a grief response.  So m  as by things that may have once been taken for granted, completely changes after life altering and fear experience (the cancer itself).", "Good one!", "Absolutely YES.", "[deleted]", "But...but...isn't the only major thing going on the wedding?!", "She can step down as bridesmaid. If the bride can't understand why she's uncomfortable then she doesn't deserve OP's support as a bridesmaid.", "Apparently to her it is.  I get her wedding is important but\u2026 she can also be a good friend at the same time.  I know bridezillas are becoming more common but I\u2019m older (mid 50\u2019s) I don\u2019t recall any of my friends pulling this crap when we all got married 30 or so years ago"]}
