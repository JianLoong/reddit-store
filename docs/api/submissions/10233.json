It's been a little over three years since I have facial reconstructive surgery and there are still many days I'm happy to still wear a mask. On another note, strapless sounds painful on fresh scars. I wouldn't do it just for that reason alone, no matter how I felt about my scars. Plus exposure to UV causes scar darkening so covering up is better on the long run.

Yuck.", "NTA. Bridezilla strikes again. If she's being that stubborn I would either bow out of the bridal party or not go at all.

Everyone has differing body types and confidence levels and this needs to be respected.

But I\u2019m also not going to throw away all my friends who have similar weaknesses: otherwise I\u2019d have no friends.", "Agree.  I think it's fine to say that it's the bride's day and if these are the dresses she really wants then she should have them but OP doesn't feel comfortable wearing that dress due to her situation.  So she'll bow out of being a bridesmaid if the dresses are that important to the bride, and happily attend the wedding as a guest.  \n\nPersonally, if I were the bride in this situation, I would select a different bridesmaid dress, although I don't really like strapless dresses for anyone.   But if the bride had always wanted this dress for her bridesmaids, then she can still have them, just without the OP."]}
