{"id": 30252, "submission_id": "17n3t9u", "title": "AITA for asking my fianc\u00e9 to bring me a glass of prosecco?", "selftext": "I (20sF) and my fianc\u00e9 (30sM) were enjoying a Friday night wind down. Had dinner, yoghurt and were sitting down for TV (we're on season 7 of 24, my first time watching).\n\nI decide to paint my nails pink as we're going out tomorrow and seeing my family. They haven't seen us since we got engaged last month. I'm in a good mood and feeling happy. \n\nAfter painting one hand, I ask him if he fancies opening a bottle of prosecco tonight (well stocked post-engagement). He says yes. I ask him if he could bring me a glass too please.\n\nThat's where the argument began. No shouting, stomping, etc. Just speaking our minds and then silence before resuming. Generally, we get along great and have very healthy communication.\n\nHell, we managed to compromise on a child-free wedding easier than this (he wanted children there, I didn't, we've settled on child-free ceremony and kids for the dinner and reception).\n\nBack to the argument.\n\nHis perspective: it's weird of me to ask him to bring me things, be it a a beverage or a blanket. That I'm a grown woman and should do these sorts of things for myself. Doing it for me would be \"simping\" and asking him to is \"toxic\".\n\nMy perspective: it's a glass of prosecco and my nails were drying. My love language is acts of service and I make him at least 3 cups of tea a week. A simple refusal is fine. His attitude about me asking was, in my opinion, \"toxic\".\n\nEarlier on in our relationship I did ask him to get me glasses of water semi-regularly. We had a discussion and he expressed his frustration. I now don't really ask, maybe once a week at most. The last time was in a cafe.\n\nFor unnecessary context, if you're interested: I wonder if it's how we grew up. He's an only child and claims his Mum never asked him to do anything like this for her. He's fiercely independent and can sometimes exist in his own little world.\n\nWhereas, I have an older sister and we just did as we were told really. Definitely learnt to play host at family gatherings, offering food and drink and just being pleasant. If someone asked for something (like a drink) and you said no, that'd be considered rude.\n\nBut I digress. I asked for prosecco, even though my 5'0 legs do in fact work.

From an American POV, it's a red flag that someone who is 30 would want to marry someone who can't legally drink out in public. If you went to a restaurant here, the two of you would not be able to share a bottle of prosecco in celebration. This is nothing against you or your age. You are exactly the right age for who you are right now!

It doesn't sound like you ask him to get things for you often, so I really don't see the issue (at least and especially if was made into such a huge issue) in asking him to get you a glass of the prosecco he also seemed to want -- unless the huge issue was asking you to open it and bring it to him instead.", "NTA and it's weird for him to make a big deal out of just a random thing that people do for their partners all the time. What was his plan? Get a glass for himself and then nothing for you?

It does sound like he's gone on the Andrew Tate bandwagon and clearly very insecure about some things.  But the comment \" his Mum never asked him to do anything like this for her\" is pretty F\\*\\*ked up. You are not his mum and that should not be the standard he holds you to. \n\nINFO Did his mum ever do thing for him? And does he expect you to to do things for him as well?  See he might be a spoiled brat. But its also possible that \"acts of service\" mean nothing to him. I mean 3 teas a week his hardly impressive by any standard but if he's happy making his own drink it means nothing to him.

Don't marry this man.\n\nGetting things for your partner is simply part of being in a relationship.

Any man who uses the term \u201csimping\u201d does not like or respect women.  You\u2019d be smart to get out before you are legally tied to the fool.

Run away now, girl!", "I really hope you take this to r/relationships or r/relationship_advice for some feedback because I think you need it. Please get some more opinions on it.", "NTA it's quite selfish in my opinion to decline to hand you something, regardless of your nails being wet or not. You'd do the same for him and he knows this so why can't he reciprocate the same standard? It's part of every day life in relationships, in families, in social settings, in the workplace, etc to ask someone to hand you something (usually because they're closer or you're too tied up with something). If sitting at a dinner table I ask someone to please pass the salt does that mean I'm lazy or \"toxic\" or that the other person is \"simping\"? Certainly not. Spending two seconds of your time to pass someone something is in my eyes a social skill and part of good manners, since you describe him as someone who \"exists in his own little world\" this could explain why he lacks this skill, and it may be a reflection of many other little social things that he doesn't do and will challenge you about.", "NTA myb your Fiance should read some comments, he probably didn\u2019t get the communal exposure of doing little favors for each other being an only child but he\u2019s an adult now starting his own family and that\u2019s what a productive family does for each other, small favors are part of the norm, nothing deeper than that it\u2019s what one does being in a community and he should probably learn that to have a happy coexistence with you", "NTA just for asking.

Had dinner, yoghurt and were sitting down for TV (we're on season 7 of 24, my first time watching).\n\nI decide to paint my nails pink as we're going out tomorrow and seeing my family. They haven't seen us since we got engaged last month. I'm in a good mood and feeling happy. \n\nAfter painting one hand, I ask him if he fancies opening a bottle of prosecco tonight (well stocked post-engagement). He says yes. I ask him if he could bring me a glass too please.\n\nThat's where the argument began. No shouting, stomping, etc. Just speaking our minds and then silence before resuming. Generally, we get along great and have very healthy communication.\n\nHell, we managed to compromise on a child-free wedding easier than this (he wanted children there, I didn't, we've settled on child-free ceremony and kids for the dinner and reception).\n\nBack to the argument.\n\nHis perspective: it's weird of me to ask him to bring me things, be it a a beverage or a blanket. That I'm a grown woman and should do these sorts of things for myself. Doing it for me would be \"simping\" and asking him to is \"toxic\".\n\nMy perspective: it's a glass of prosecco and my nails were drying. My love language is acts of service and I make him at least 3 cups of tea a week. A simple refusal is fine. His attitude about me asking was, in my opinion, \"toxic\".\n\nEarlier on in our relationship I did ask him to get me glasses of water semi-regularly. We had a discussion and he expressed his frustration. I now don't really ask, maybe once a week at most. The last time was in a cafe.\n\nFor unnecessary context, if you're interested: I wonder if it's how we grew up. He's an only child and claims his Mum never asked him to do anything like this for her. He's fiercely independent and can sometimes exist in his own little world.\n\nWhereas, I have an older sister and we just did as we were told really. Definitely learnt to play host at family gatherings, offering food and drink and just being pleasant. If someone asked for something (like a drink) and you said no, that'd be considered rude.\n\nBut I digress. I asked for prosecco, even though my 5'0 legs do in fact work.

I was super weak after the birthing & he would bring home takeout everyday & feed me while I fed the baby.\n\nAlso he never failed to make me all the milkshakes I wanted.\n\nBig part of why we had that second kid. \ud83e\udd23", "When my friend was breastfeeding her partner bought a camelback and would fill it, bring it and put the hose so she could continuously have easy access to water while she did the baby thing. This allowed him to focus on her other needs like food and comfort while still taking care of the water. I can\u2019t imagine not doing the same should anyone around me be in the same boat. Toxic masculinity needs to be wiped out already. It has no place in our society anymore", "When I got pregnant with my last, I was still breastfeeding the baby before him. This continued through the first trimester of that pregnancy. It wiped me out. I was beyond exhausted - and as it turned out, very anemic. I was a SAHM of 4, the oldest of whom was only 6. I managed to keep them fed, changed, off to school/preschool, etc... during the day and got dinner started in the evenings. As soon as my husband got home from work, I went to bed. He'd finish cooking and bring me a plate in bed. He got the kids fed, did the bedtime routine, and anything else that needed to be done, including bringing me anything I needed. If any of the kids needed me (such as the nursing baby), he'd bring them to me too (not ask me me to come to them). It was a really rough few months, but he stepped up without complaint. Or not any that I remember lol.", "The only bulletproof excuse our house for letting the other person do all the work is \"I'd help but Walter is on my lap.\"  Walter will be 21 in February, we do not move him. \ud83d\udc95", "That\u2019s a biggy! My husband almost daily delivers one of the cats to me.", "Ditto!", "I'm sorry to hear that, you do deserve better than having to drive for soup. I gave my partner a list and they came home with more than I had even asked for. I've done the same for them, I feel like everyone should have and deserves a partnership like that.", "Opening up a bottle or pouring a glass of wine for only yourself when it's going to be shared with others is just fucking weird no matter what your relationship is with the other people. What kind of arsehole does that?", "> I personally associate the use of this term with super toxic incel culture, and I think it comes from the idea that being of service to a woman in any way is automatically emmasculating for \"real/alpha males\", and if you do so you feminize yourself and accept a subservient/submissive role in the relationship.  \n>  \n>Fucking gross and total red flag.\n\nYep, incel was the first thing to come to mind when I saw \"simping\". Over the simple act of bringing her a glass while he was getting one for himself too. Major red flag. I'd get out of there before it's too late.", "I wouldn\u2019t stick around long enough for him to ask. Girl needs to run.", "Yeah nah the question was more like shall we open a bottle cos I doubt she wanted to smash the whole thing herself. Pretty obvious, really", "Yeah it's just some language tools to communicate better without sounding like you're just demanding TOUCH ME AND AFFIRM ME MORE, but rather inviting your partner to learn about you and show their love for you.\n\nJust people take it in weird directions", "Cat paralysis.  I can't even begin to guess how many chores my daughter got out of because of \"cat-on-lap!\"", "r/cathostage", "Oh same here, like if the cat is on you then you don't move and can ask the other person for whatever", "Totally agree.", "\"I've been catted\" is a valid excuse for not being able to do everything in my house too.", "Hrmm, a \u2018bit\u2019 predatory", "We say encatted", "Just had to go in the other room and put my husband\u2019s phone in to charge because he\u2019s \u201cbecatted.\u201d", "Ah well... She said she has a \"different lifestyle\".\n\nPeople tried explaining being a teenage is not a \"lifestyle\" but a life stage. To no avail.
