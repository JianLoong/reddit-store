I also have 2 adult children and a granddaughter, who live on their own. \nI had a traumatic childhood. My mother and I have a strained relationship because of it. I\u2019ve been to therapy and she has not. I\u2019ve learned to forgive and due to my culture (Indigenous American) I personally cannot just go no contact without severe repercussion from the rest of my family who were supporting and did indeed try to help me. \nMy mother now 62 loves back in our home state. She still has a drinking problem.She recently divorced her husband, moved out of her apartment and became roommates with this young couple (early 20\u2019s). She needs a new place to stay as they want to start a family and have asked her to move out. \nWe recently had a fight because I discovered she has been drunk driving. Drunk driving is a hard boundary for me as I\u2019ve lost several family members from it. I\u2019ve had to help those family members through it. You don\u2019t want to know the pain of picking coffins for toddlers. \nI won\u2019t drink and drive. Period. Learning my mother had been doing it made me furious. I stopped talking to her for several weeks because she admitted she\u2019s \u201chad\u201d to do it several times to get home. I\u2019ve taught her to use Uber and Lyft. \nAs a child (10ish) I had to drive to the bar to pick her up some nights, if I knew she\u2019d have to get up in the morning. I did this frequently enough the bouncer and bartender knew who I was and who I was there for. \nWhen I learned she\u2019d been doing it again I was livid. Then she asked if she could come live me me and my husband. I told here there are rules and she\u2019d have to abide by them. I don\u2019t think they are unreasonable. \n\nThe rules: \n1. Absolutely no drunk driving. If I find out she was drinking and driving she\u2019d be asked to leave regardless of the time or day.\n2. Do not get drunk in front of my son or my g-daughter. If my husband and I drink, it\u2019s after he goes to bed. Our g-daughter sometimes comes and spends the night and the same rule would apply.\n3. She may not share a room with the baby. We\u2019d make a space for her in the living room until we found a larger place to accommodate her.\n4. More warning than a rule, I did say I was finished picking her up from bars.\n\nThose are the rules. After hearing them, she stated \u201cI can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t do that.\u201d So I said simply, \u201cthen the answer is no\u201d. She said \u201cFINE.\u201d And has been distant since. She called me several days later saying she\u2019s a grown woman and I can\u2019t force her not to drink. I never said she\u2019s not allowed to drink, I said \u201cdon\u2019t drink and drive and don\u2019t be drunk around my son and granddaughter\u201d. Of course she called my Aunties and my uncles and told them I won\u2019t let her live with me. I did explain it to them, and I\u2019m being told from them she\u2019s my mother and I should care for her the way she did for my Gran. \nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1694058445, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16c5hfh/aita_for_not_letting_my_mother_come_live_with_me/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are protecting your family. That's what you should be doing. You know in your heart you're right, stay strong.", "Nta, but she's right in that she can't agree to abide by those rules she is an active alcoholic. And it wouldn't be appropriate for an active alcoholic to live with your 5 year old. \n\nEven if she had said yes, it wouldn't matter she'd break the rules very quickly. It would just bring a lot of turmoil to your home. It might be hard, but it's better for you just to say no. As long as it's reasonable, help her find somewhere else to live (perhaps somewhere within walking distance of the alcohol. At least then, she'd be less likely to drive. Idk that might be considered enabling)\n\nI'd also recommend returning to therapy and/or al-anon meetings.", "NTA. You know you\u2019re right. \n\nHow different would your childhood have been if you\u2019d had someone to screen you from your mom\u2019s behavior when you were a kid? \n\nProtect your children. I don\u2019t even think I\u2019d let her live with me even if she *did* agree with your rules, because you know she can\u2019t follow them. \n\nAsk her to get some help for the drinking and once she\u2019s been sober for a year, you can revisit the whole subject.

Not even a bit.\n\n2-bedroom appartment is a small place even if you had a good relationship with mom.\n\nYour rules are perfectly reasonable. You'd be a bad parent if you let her be a bad influence on your children.", "NTA\n\nYou already have a strained relationship and she wasn't really much of a mother while you were growing up and it sounds like little has changed.\n\nYou also don't have enough room to accommodate her at the moment and giving up your living room means you have no shared space to sit in other than your kitchen.  A bigger place will cost more and your mother isn't going to be contributing to the expenses.\n\nYour child will be traumatised by her because she will drink.  And she'll not be saying very nice things about you when she is alone with him.  And all it would take is the length of time for you to take a shower, that she can be saying things behind your back.  She doesn't even need to be baby sitting him.  \n\nYour mother is likely an alcoholic.  She sounds like she drinks a lot and has for a long time.  So she won't seem as drunk as others having a similar amount as she has built up a tolerance.  But it doesn't mean she isn't badly affected by the alcohol and will make poor decisions.\n\nTo be honest, if you know she is drink driving, I would find out what bars she's going to and calling the police when she leaves so they can pick her up while she's drunk in the car.  That might get her some jail time... especially if they catch her multiple times... she won't have to worry about where to live then.  She's gotten away with it so far but I'd be seeing if I could do something to get her caught in the act.\n\nYour priority is to your son.  You need to protect him.  You may think you are obligated to take your mother in but if you do this it will be to the detriment of all your other relationships ie your husband and your child.", "NTA.  You are much more than not the asshole.  You are a hero.  Generational abuse run rife and ruins far too many native people.  The cure is hard and it's so much easier to just let it go.  And so it continues.  Your actions may or may not save your mother.  But it will save your children and grandchildren.  They will demand better and higher standards.\n\nThe steps you are taking are exactly how change happens.  Follow your heart and head.  Lead your family towards the light.  And thank you.", "NTA. Protect your kids.", "NTA.\n\nThese are not so much rules as they are boundaries to protect your family. She is right about one thing though; she is a grown woman and she needs to start acting like one. God knows she hasn't done that  your entire life.", "NTA\n\nThese are your boundaries, if she can't promise to live within them don't let her stay. I guarantee she will have broken every one of your boundaries within a week, but by then you will be stuck with her.\n\nLet someone else in the family take her in.", "I would never let an alcoholic live in the same home as my children. It\u2019s unsafe and they don\u2019t need to be exposed to drunkenness as if it\u2019s something normal", "NTA; not even a little.\n\nI have a similar history with my mother and one thing I had to learn is that I don\u2019t owe my mother anything. I know a lot of people and cultures feel that it\u2019s the child\u2019s job to care for the parent, but my mother was basically a mother in name only and I would never risk her being around my children. \n\nHonestly, your children and grandchildren need you more and you owe it to them to have a safe, calm home to grow up in. She\u2019s right; she\u2019s an adult. She can figure her life out for herself.\n\nGood luck to you. \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA. This is the hill to die on.", "NTA you didn't tell her she couldn't live with you. You put down boundaries if she was going to. If she doesn't want to abide the boundaries, than she can choose not to live with you. Don't let anyone flip this around on you. She is choosing not to live with you. In fact, I think your offer was pretty gracious. She's lucky she even got the offer at all.", "NTA, people with addiction have to hit rock bottom before the clean up their lives.  Being homeless might be her rock bottom.  How can you trust her around your young child and grandchild?  What if she gets drunk after everyone goes to bed and starts a fire?  What if she gets drunk, gets a ride home and brings him in to the home?  There are so many dangers for you and your family having her there.", "NTA.

The best you can do for her is to point her in the direction of healing.
