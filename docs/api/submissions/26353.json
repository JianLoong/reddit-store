I also have 2 adult children and a granddaughter, who live on their own. \nI had a traumatic childhood. My mother and I have a strained relationship because of it. I\u2019ve been to therapy and she has not. I\u2019ve learned to forgive and due to my culture (Indigenous American) I personally cannot just go no contact without severe repercussion from the rest of my family who were supporting and did indeed try to help me. \nMy mother now 62 loves back in our home state. She still has a drinking problem.She recently divorced her husband, moved out of her apartment and became roommates with this young couple (early 20\u2019s). She needs a new place to stay as they want to start a family and have asked her to move out. \nWe recently had a fight because I discovered she has been drunk driving. Drunk driving is a hard boundary for me as I\u2019ve lost several family members from it. I\u2019ve had to help those family members through it. You don\u2019t want to know the pain of picking coffins for toddlers. \nI won\u2019t drink and drive. Period. Learning my mother had been doing it made me furious. I stopped talking to her for several weeks because she admitted she\u2019s \u201chad\u201d to do it several times to get home. I\u2019ve taught her to use Uber and Lyft. \nAs a child (10ish) I had to drive to the bar to pick her up some nights, if I knew she\u2019d have to get up in the morning. I did this frequently enough the bouncer and bartender knew who I was and who I was there for. \nWhen I learned she\u2019d been doing it again I was livid. Then she asked if she could come live me me and my husband. I told here there are rules and she\u2019d have to abide by them. I don\u2019t think they are unreasonable. \n\nThe rules: \n1. Absolutely no drunk driving. If I find out she was drinking and driving she\u2019d be asked to leave regardless of the time or day.\n2. Do not get drunk in front of my son or my g-daughter. If my husband and I drink, it\u2019s after he goes to bed. Our g-daughter sometimes comes and spends the night and the same rule would apply.\n3. She may not share a room with the baby. We\u2019d make a space for her in the living room until we found a larger place to accommodate her.\n4. More warning than a rule, I did say I was finished picking her up from bars.\n\nThose are the rules. After hearing them, she stated \u201cI can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t do that.\u201d So I said simply, \u201cthen the answer is no\u201d. She said \u201cFINE.\u201d And has been distant since. She called me several days later saying she\u2019s a grown woman and I can\u2019t force her not to drink. I never said she\u2019s not allowed to drink, I said \u201cdon\u2019t drink and drive and don\u2019t be drunk around my son and granddaughter\u201d. Of course she called my Aunties and my uncles and told them I won\u2019t let her live with me. I did explain it to them, and I\u2019m being told from them she\u2019s my mother and I should care for her the way she did for my Gran. \nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1694058445, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16c5hfh/aita_for_not_letting_my_mother_come_live_with_me/", "score": 391, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would just bring a lot of turmoil to your home. It might be hard, but it's better for you just to say no. As long as it's reasonable, help her find somewhere else to live (perhaps somewhere within walking distance of the alcohol. At least then, she'd be less likely to drive.

A bigger place will cost more and your mother isn't going to be contributing to the expenses.\n\nYour child will be traumatised by her because she will drink.  And she'll not be saying very nice things about you when she is alone with him.  And all it would take is the length of time for you to take a shower, that she can be saying things behind your back.  She doesn't even need to be baby sitting him.  \n\nYour mother is likely an alcoholic.  She sounds like she drinks a lot and has for a long time.  So she won't seem as drunk as others having a similar amount as she has built up a tolerance.  But it doesn't mean she isn't badly affected by the alcohol and will make poor decisions.\n\nTo be honest, if you know she is drink driving, I would find out what bars she's going to and calling the police when she leaves so they can pick her up while she's drunk in the car.  That might get her some jail time... especially if they catch her multiple times... she won't have to worry about where to live then.  She's gotten away with it so far but I'd be seeing if I could do something to get her caught in the act.\n\nYour priority is to your son.  You need to protect him.

I guarantee she will have broken every one of your boundaries within a week, but by then you will be stuck with her.\n\nLet someone else in the family take her in.", "I would never let an alcoholic live in the same home as my children. It\u2019s unsafe and they don\u2019t need to be exposed to drunkenness as if it\u2019s something normal", "NTA; not even a little.\n\nI have a similar history with my mother and one thing I had to learn is that I don\u2019t owe my mother anything. I know a lot of people and cultures feel that it\u2019s the child\u2019s job to care for the parent, but my mother was basically a mother in name only and I would never risk her being around my children. \n\nHonestly, your children and grandchildren need you more and you owe it to them to have a safe, calm home to grow up in.

In fact, I think your offer was pretty gracious. She's lucky she even got the offer at all.", "NTA, people with addiction have to hit rock bottom before the clean up their lives.
