If his wife hosts team events and excludes her, it\u2019s a hostile work environment. Petulant children in the workplace with the attitude you\u2019re describing wreak SO MUCH havoc with their careless pettyness. \n\nThat behavior will fly while you\u2019re a student, or president of some extracurricular club. But when you have expensive, *avoidable* mistakes that can any way at all be attributed to not being included in team related activities due to the bosses personal vendetta, the higher ups get pretty pissy pretty quickly.  \n\n\n-signed, a tired engineer who would love not managing interpersonal conflict for grown ass adults. Like sorry, some people have jobs where avoidable mistakes are absolutely unacceptable. For one of my old jobs, an accident means an airplane can have a catastrophic failure in the air. The number of crotchety old hags who wouldn\u2019t work next to someone they were mad at was insane. And guess what program has constantly hemorrhaging money?? Oh yeah, the ones where crucial work related info was discussed at those non-work related happy hours, and then the people excluded from that would never even know the conversation already happened. UGH", "you are right, they should just fire the employee who accused the spouse of being a deadbeat rather than risk keeping them on to randomly start fires.", "Oh, in my personal opinion? When I see drama stirrers on my team like the coworker in this post, I\u2019ll jump on any opportunity to get them off the team I can get. Cant fix stupid", "legend", "Nta the spoils of working hard and saving.", "Nah. They\u2019re the asshole. Your comment was snarky mic drop worthy.", "NTA. I\u2019d have singled out the one making the comment and kicked her out.", "Nta. Why do some guests find it acceptable to insult the owner or the spouse of the owner of the house especially when theyre guests in that home? If i were the host, id want to kick them out right away coz that\u2019s offensive and rude", "NTA. The coworker is though.", "Hahaha nice. She deserved it 100%. It\u2019s awful that your wife didn\u2019t stood up for you though.", "NTA but I wanna know what happened next! Did this person say have a retort? Did they have a shocked Pikachu face? Did your wife defend you when they said that in the first place? C'mon man, don't leave us hangin'!", "NTA.  That woman was incredibly rude to both you and your wife, in your own home. No holds barred.", "ESH", "You don't MAKE money. You're an unemployed trustfund kid. \nTbh, she should have kept her mouth shut. But, I believe you're insufferable to be around.", "You seem to have posted this in the wrong reddit, this belongs in \"That Happened\"", "NTA\n\nthey deserved all that smoke lmao \nIt's 2023 and people still judge a book by it's cover\n\nI'm surprised your wife wasn't offended when they trash talked about you right in front of her", "NTA - you didn't start it but you did finish it :)", "NTA your comment to  co workers for the win.\ud83d\udd25", "NTA \n\nWho says that in someone\u2019s home? At a work function! When you hardly know them!\n\nBrain cells of a dory fish!", "NTA. the entitlement of that lady.... geez", "Even so, shouldn\u2019t you not want to make your wife\u2019s life more difficult?", "\u201cLazy slob\u201d who was a doctor and is now currently studying law?\n\nSure.", "I mean they didn\u2019t know anything about the husbands work or finances, so how is this an equivalent? The equivalent is making the judgement while having no idea what the wife does.", "Who said she's poor? If they moved to another country for her job, I highly doubt her coworkers are poor. Putting some snobbish middle class person in their place is entirely different than you on your soapbox about dissing people in poverty.", "If a woman responded this way to a man who insulted her you would be calling her a \u2018queen\u2019, not petty.", "Exactly", "No, I'd still be calling her petty.", "Yeah I'm not buying it either. If it happened at all, this is what the husband wishes he'd said.", "Jerk store!!"]}
