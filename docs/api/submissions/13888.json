I've had him since he was 6 months old and he has always slept on *his* bed in my bedroom. He has quite bad separation anxiety (he's a rescue) so he has always slept in my room.

He will sometimes get up turn round and lay back down but the noise is minimal.

This is easily resolvable so not sure why this is being made into a big deal.", "NTA. Your dog is family and he comes first. I can slightly understand if he doesn\u2019t want the dog in the bed with you but if he\u2019s in his own bed that\u2019s his bed. He shouldn\u2019t have to be moved (which causes anxiety to an already anxious dog) because he moves around a lot or snores. What if you start snoring? Will you have to move out of your bed too?", "NAH.\n\nThe dog was there first. The dog is family, that is your baby and you all have a routine. It is not unreasonable for you to be against changing that. \n\nHowever, your BF isn't an AH either as his life and routine do not include a dog like yours does, that's a big change/adjustment as well. \n\nAs ridiculous as it can be at times, there is something to be said for the whole \"cat people/ dog people\" argument.  Cat people need to be with cat people, dog people with dog people. Yeah you can like both and be alright with having both, but your partner needs to be in that boat too; and if you want no pets, date someone who wants no pets.\n\n Is your BF a dog lover? If so, maybe suggest alternatives to the noise, such as a fan? (white noise like that can prevent the dog from waking him). Talk to him, as a fellow dog lover I'm sure something can be arranged that is more fair. If he ISN'T a dog person, you have to decide if that's ok in your relationship. I know that sounds extreme but seriously, I'm not saying just dump him. What I AM saying is everyone makes sacrifices and compromises in relationships, and maybe this sacrifice/compromise is one too many to make; only you can know that, so be mindful and look at the big picture when deciding what to do.\n\n It can be hard managing pets and relationships sometimes lol BUUUT hey, we say pets are family, family can OBVIOUSLY be difficult on relationships so I guess this should be expected \ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019m going to say NAH.\n\nTotally understandable that you do not want to cause your dog undue anxiety and stress, and displace a well established routine. But it\u2019s also understandable that your partner is unhappy about it if it is disturbing his sleep. \n\nSo I see the following options:\n- sleep separately, then you can keep the dog with you and he can sleep undisturbed (requires a second bedroom);\n- decide whether you\u2019re willing to compromise on your dog\u2019s quality of life and care for the partner. Your dog might adjust, but he also might not. Are you willing to try that? If you are, then you\u2019re going to need to be disciplined (ie every night). But it\u2019s also okay if you\u2019re not willing to. It\u2019s okay to be incompatible on this issue. But this is potentially going to be a dealbreaker, because this is about diametrically opposed needs (his sleep vs your dog\u2019s anxiety).\n\nI have a cat I love very much and I don\u2019t let her in the bedroom at night because I need undisturbed sleep; she\u2019s always had that routine and she\u2019s fine with it. But having seen the stress that a change in routine causes her, I would certainly think twice about a relationship if that\u2019s what they needed me to do.", "Nope NTA at all. This might just not be the partner for you and that\u2019s ok. Treasure your dog. Tell your boyfriend that you are sorry but the dog has to be in his bed in whatever room you are sleeping whether his house or yours. Tell him if this is a deal breaker than sorry.", "NAH. You both have quite reasonable positions that neither of you want to compromise on. You don't want your dog to be stressed, your boyfriend wants to get a decent night's sleep. Unless you can find a compromise that works, this may be a make or break issue. You might think your boyfriend's position is one that's dumb or comes from a lack of empathy, but he very clearly feels strongly about this, so it's worth sitting down and having a reasonable conversation about.\n\nAlso, because no one else has mentioned it, and I know it would be an issue for me, you might want to ask if boyfriend's actual problem is having the dog in the room while you're having sex. Because that will be much easier to solve.", "NTA - doggo is family.  now if doggo was sleeping on your bed, thats a problem.  but he's got his own bed.  if bf can't deal with that it's best you know about it now before you waste too much time on him.", "NAH. There is no easy answer here. Yes it\u2019s your place, your pup was there first and you\u2019re well within your rights to not want to switch up the routine. Your doggo is hugely important to you and that\u2019s more than understandable. I absolutely love dogs and love having them around.\n\nI have also however been in the situation of your partner. I dated a guy whose dog would sleep in the same bedroom and, as a light sleeper, it drove me nuts. You also mention your dog is large: that can make a difference. My dogs have always slept in another room. Not that you\u2019re wrong, at all, I just can hear everything and they can shuffle around, snore, pant etc\u2026.You mention your partner didn\u2019t grow up with pets, so whilst the situation is hard for you to understand, that\u2019s just his preference. \n\nYour preference for doggo in your room is more than ok, as is his for not wanting your pupper in the room you both sleep in. This is about current compatibility, and if either of you can adapt/compromise. I hope you can, and best of luck.", "NTA - the dog has been their longer and you know what is best for him, it's your house. Also, I'm sure your BF moves around and snores which might distract you or the dog, just saying...", "oh my god, doggo has been with you for *years.* one year is nothing next to that. NTA. *he* can sleep in the landing lol", "NTA.\n\nI can almost guarantee that if you were to allow this guy to move in, he would eventually insist on you getting rid of your dog, \"since it's my home too\".", "Everyone is different, I like animals but I would never dream of allowing a pet on my bed ever and especially when I sleep. I do have allergies and such but even without them, it\u2019s not happening\n\nHowever I understand people are close with their pets and can\u2019t imagine a reality where their pets don\u2019t sleep with them and that is okay, cute even.\n\nNone of these realities are wrong, they are just different, there is no AH or badguy simply from the differences\n\nHowever, if you combine these two people, it\u2019s chaos. Your dog is part of your home and it is his right to sleep in the bed so naturally you don\u2019t understand why the dog should be made to be put out.\nYour partner doesn\u2019t even believe the dog should be in the bed so they don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t put the dog out. \nTo you, the dog snoring isn\u2019t a big deal and you are able to sleep through but you don\u2019t see the fact that your partner is struggling to sleep, as a direct result of the dog, as a big issue. disturbances in sleep are serious no matter how fickle. \nI see why your partner feels upset that you don\u2019t seem to think it\u2019s a big deal.\nYour partner however also fully knows your relationship and habits with your dog and still wants to sleep in your home. They could simply not sleepover or could understand that you too have completely different ideas on the boundaries of the dog. He knew the situation when he got into it and chose to continue and so it\u2019s weird that he is now trying to change something that you have always done.\nThen comes the fact that the dog takes a portion of the bed, for you, youre used to it and you don\u2019t even notice it, to your partner it\u2019s a huge adjustment in their comfortability whilst they sleep and again affects the amount of sleep they get. \nHowever, your dog should absolutely be able to go where it wants and it\u2019s comfort should also be considered. This is also what they are used to, they\u2019re used to sleeping there and i know changing it habits is probably confusing to him. Its a no win situation. It\u2019s up to you which one matter the most to you and act accordingly Z\nBut you can\u2019t negate the physical issues that your partner has with the current routine\nNAH/ ESH", "NTA. It seems unfair to you and your dog that both of you should get worse sleep for someone who starts fights when he's ultimately in your home as a guest and he's seemingly taken no steps to resolve the situation other than trying to make you and your dog alter your routines.", "NTA. Make the boyfriend sleep on the landing.", "NAH. He\u2019s your dog and he was there first, but not everyone can sleep well with dogs in the bed and he\u2019s not an AH for not wanting a dog in his bed (I do think you\u2019re overreacting a bit with the \u201cwhat if it were a baby?? part - animals are not children). It sounds like you two just aren\u2019t compatible.", "Your boyfriend lacks empathy.

Move the bed to the doorway inside the room for a while. Then outside the room with the door open. Then eventually with the door closed. Unless you have a studio appt, then bf needs to suck it up and get himself some earplugs.", "NTA It's your house and your dogs.

I won't lie and say they fell in love with each other, but they did eventually learn to tolerate one another.

Personally, my doggo sleeps with me, I\u2019d be damned if someone told me he couldn\u2019t anymore. He\u2019s 95 lbs., hogs the bed, sideways-donkey-kicks me in his sleep and his snoring sounds like pig-monster noises. He\u2019s still not going anywhere.\n\nI\u2019d understand if someone didn\u2019t like that. But we wouldn\u2019t be compatible. It\u2019s too important to me as well as my velvety pig-monster.", "NTA\n\nMy dogs slept on my bed, despite having their own beds.   I'm not making them move for anybody.", "Dog stays, dude goes", "NTA.  Kick bf to the curb.", "NTA. Find a new man and buy your doggo a toy for putting up with this clown", "NTA\n\nDogs are more intuitive than men are most times. Let the dog in the room.", "NTA - dude can take a sleep aid if he\u2019s that light of a sleeper.", "NTA, and it's up to you to decide if your boyfriend is worth working through this with. Have you tried getting a box fan, or white noise machine or something? My wife can't sleep without noise, so we have a box fan in our room that she turns on every night at bedtime. I got used to it easily, and it's been great for drowning out the neighborhood noise in the morning. We used to live in an apartment with a baby living below us, he'd wake up our roommate super early every morning, but we'd sleep through it because of the fan. I'd consider trying that, it might be enough to drown out the dog nose so you can all sleep comfortably.", "NTA - it's not about the noise your dog makes - otherwise your bf would have issues sleeping beside any other living being as ALL of us move and snore/fart/ talk in their sleep/ etc.", "Nta, but I do understand the bf not being able to sleep I'm SUCH a light sleeper it's why we don't let the dog sleep in the bedroom with his night time running and licking and snoring! \nHe's your dog and he was there first, bf can wear headphones or ear plugs, or get used to it but it's not fair to the dog to suddenly kick him out", "No. I've got the same thing with my cat (right down to him being a rescue too/separation anxiety) and the worst thing I ever did was let my (now ex) boyfriend shut him out of my bedroom. They don't understand and they've done nothing wrong to deserve it, and I would never ever let a man lay down the law like that again in MY house! Boyfriend needs to realise he's coming into your dog's house, he doesn't get to start making decisions like that. Suck it up or don't stay over.", "NTA. One of my dogs is the same way. They sleep in my room and sometimes wake me up when they move or lick. I use a sound machine to drown it out. Works perfectly. Try that", ">>let the bf sleep on the landing...\n\n....because HE makes noise moving around and snores at times \ud83d\ude09", "Woah a reasonable answer !\n\nPoor sleep is not healthy for OP \u2018s partner nor their relationship. \n\nIf OP chooses the dog over the partner, that\u2019s all fine and dandy, but it means their relationship likely won\u2019t last.\n\nMost dogs (not all) will adjust given proper training. As you noted, consistency is key. OP needs to make the dog new new home and make it special and have it that way all the time. I would suggest OP try this first as a reasonable solution because the 2 bedroom option is still choosing dog over partner and probably won\u2019t go over great.\n\nOther potential solutions:\n- earplugs\n- white noise maker\n- sleep music that plays all night\n- if OP doesn\u2019t have them, curtains and rugs help absorb noise", "I don't blame him being a rescue for his anxiety, but it is a big part of the root issue. Before I got him, he was locked in a room for days on end with no food. We have worked on it A LOT and he is much better today vs when he first came to me as a terrified skinny pup.\n\nI'll have had him for 3 years in a couple of weeks.", "What ridiculous speculation. Guy just doesn't want to be woken up in the middle of the night, that must mean he hates dogs", "Haha I feel you with boxers, they are snory boys! \n\nI'll look at white noise apps and earplugs as a second suggestion from people and have a sit down with bf to try and find a solution that works for both of us.", "Aww that's so sad, I get people aren't all dog lovers but it was kind of the deal when we started dating. I never hid my furball, he knew that it was a 2 for 1 deal from the start", "Most people don't equate human children to dogs and likely would treat them very differently. \n\nI realize that many dog owners view them similarly and treat them that way. Most non-dog owners would likely treat a human child very differently than a dog.", "Ear plugs are not very comfortable but may a white noise machine can help \nNah", "Well, it *is* a very common issue. Lots of people have different opinions and preferences. Is there a specific part of the dog moving around that wakes him? Like I'm thinking since the dog isn't on the bed at night and if your floors aren't carpet, get a large rug to put under the dog bed that spans towards the door so if the dog moves around, the sound is cushioned and there's no nails on a hard floor sound.\n\nOther than that, have an honest conversation. You've tried to compromise on it and are willing to try other things to help, but the dog staying in the room is non negotiable. Explain the dog has been there longer, and you made a commitment to your dog when you got him, so the dog is going to take priority barring extreme circumstances. If he's an okay guy, he'll understand and yall can figure something out, like possible separate rooms if you move into together down the road and he doesn't adjust", "Honestly I\u2019d talk to him about getting separate bedrooms if you move in together. It\u2019s really not that uncommon to do when one person is a light sleeper. My grandparents did it cause my grandma snored and they were married for 55 years.", "If you think your bf would treat a child poorly that reflects badly on him, but most people dont view dogs and children the same. You can't really equate to the two. \n\nI don't have a dog and wouldn't let one sleep in my room. Both my children slept in my room as infants. I cared for them often during the night, feeding and changing as needed and getting them back to sleep. My ability to parent my children is has no relation to the fact I wouldn't want a dog sleeping my room. \n\nDogs are not children.", "A big soft Rottie? \ud83d\ude0d BF is dreaming if he thinks you\u2019re choosing him over that sweet chonky angel. \n\nSeriously though my big old American Bully sleeps on my bed and snores like a\u2026 well like a big old American Bully. I pop in the earplugs, problem solved.\n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA and keep on advocating for your fur family.", "Hahaha bless your big floof! My buddy is too big to be on the bed he would need his own entire side \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 he is literally human size once he's lying down fully comfy legs extended \ud83d\ude48\n\nI'm definitely going to suggest trying earplugs a few people have mentioned it", "Thank you for taking care of so many babies that deserve a loving home \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c I can only imagine the work that goes into it so you my friend are an angel \ud83e\udd70", "If he's on the bed, does he try to contort his giant body to fit the space? My brother's huge dog loved to cuddle but was way too big to fit on the bed with two other people. So she would squeeze between them, very carefully contort herself, and hold this awkward pose and pretend to sleep, as if to say, \"See! I fit! Let's snuggle and go to sleep as if I'm just a little 15 pound pup. This is totally normal!\"\n\nShe was such a good goofball.", "I believe it, lol.  I have a 40 lb GSD/Pit Bull/Shih Tzu/ Rotti mix (bizarre mix I know, lol), she basically looks like a GSD with stumpy little legs, and she STILL manages to hog half of my queen size bed every night, lol.  Some nights it\u2019s more like 3/4, depending on how she stretches out.  \ud83d\ude02"]}
