I've had him since he was 6 months old and he has always slept on *his* bed in my bedroom. He has quite bad separation anxiety (he's a rescue) so he has always slept in my room. He doesn't sleep on my bed unless I'm sick and comes for a snuggle.\n\nI have been dating a wonderful guy (34M) for just over a year. Everything else is amazing. But.\n\nHe hates having the dog in the bedroom \"because he makes noise moving around/snores at times\"\n\nI have made my dog sleep on the landing several times (on his bed) at the request of my bf, but he (the dog) gets visibly anxious (he sits right behind the door and pants for hours) and it breaks my heart. This dog has gotten me through some extremely rough times and he means the world to me. Knowing he's out there stressed just makes me anxious and everyone but my bf has a bad night's sleep as a result.\n\nThe past few times bf has stayed over, I have tried leaving dog outside the room but ended up letting him in because a) it's my house/dogs house and b) I just can't leave him stressed all night and c) it isn't fair to have him in some nights but not others, the dog doesn't understand.\n\nHe isn't even that loud, usually lies on his bed and goes to sleep and doesn't move until morning. He will sometimes get up turn round and lay back down but the noise is minimal. I admit some nights he does snore, but I drown it out whereas bf is a lighter sleeper.\n\nThis has caused a few small arguments/us going to sleep not talking and I'm seriously wondering if this can even work long-term if we can't even agree on where the dog sleeps. What if it was a baby in a crib? Are they a nuisance too?\n\nI've decided I just won't put my dog and myself through this again night after night, so he will sleep on his bed in my room whether bf sleeps over or not.\n\nSo..AITA for refusing to make my dog sleep out on the landing because it inconveniences my bf?\n\nEDIT: for those confused by \"landing\" I mean the hallway outside of my bedroom door.\n\nEDIT 2: The dog does not sleep on *my* bed.

This is easily resolvable so not sure why this is being made into a big deal.", "NTA. Your dog is family and he comes first. I can slightly understand if he doesn\u2019t want the dog in the bed with you but if he\u2019s in his own bed that\u2019s his bed. He shouldn\u2019t have to be moved (which causes anxiety to an already anxious dog) because he moves around a lot or snores. What if you start snoring? Will you have to move out of your bed too?", "NAH.\n\nThe dog was there first. The dog is family, that is your baby and you all have a routine. It is not unreasonable for you to be against changing that. \n\nHowever, your BF isn't an AH either as his life and routine do not include a dog like yours does, that's a big change/adjustment as well. \n\nAs ridiculous as it can be at times, there is something to be said for the whole \"cat people/ dog people\" argument.  Cat people need to be with cat people, dog people with dog people. Yeah you can like both and be alright with having both, but your partner needs to be in that boat too; and if you want no pets, date someone who wants no pets.\n\n Is your BF a dog lover? If so, maybe suggest alternatives to the noise, such as a fan? (white noise like that can prevent the dog from waking him). Talk to him, as a fellow dog lover I'm sure something can be arranged that is more fair. If he ISN'T a dog person, you have to decide if that's ok in your relationship. I know that sounds extreme but seriously, I'm not saying just dump him. What I AM saying is everyone makes sacrifices and compromises in relationships, and maybe this sacrifice/compromise is one too many to make; only you can know that, so be mindful and look at the big picture when deciding what to do.\n\n It can be hard managing pets and relationships sometimes lol BUUUT hey, we say pets are family, family can OBVIOUSLY be difficult on relationships so I guess this should be expected \ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019m going to say NAH.\n\nTotally understandable that you do not want to cause your dog undue anxiety and stress, and displace a well established routine. But it\u2019s also understandable that your partner is unhappy about it if it is disturbing his sleep. \n\nSo I see the following options:\n- sleep separately, then you can keep the dog with you and he can sleep undisturbed (requires a second bedroom);\n- decide whether you\u2019re willing to compromise on your dog\u2019s quality of life and care for the partner. Your dog might adjust, but he also might not. Are you willing to try that? If you are, then you\u2019re going to need to be disciplined (ie every night). But it\u2019s also okay if you\u2019re not willing to. It\u2019s okay to be incompatible on this issue. But this is potentially going to be a dealbreaker, because this is about diametrically opposed needs (his sleep vs your dog\u2019s anxiety).\n\nI have a cat I love very much and I don\u2019t let her in the bedroom at night because I need undisturbed sleep; she\u2019s always had that routine and she\u2019s fine with it. But having seen the stress that a change in routine causes her, I would certainly think twice about a relationship if that\u2019s what they needed me to do.", "Nope NTA at all. This might just not be the partner for you and that\u2019s ok. Treasure your dog. Tell your boyfriend that you are sorry but the dog has to be in his bed in whatever room you are sleeping whether his house or yours. Tell him if this is a deal breaker than sorry.", "NAH. You both have quite reasonable positions that neither of you want to compromise on. You don't want your dog to be stressed, your boyfriend wants to get a decent night's sleep. Unless you can find a compromise that works, this may be a make or break issue. You might think your boyfriend's position is one that's dumb or comes from a lack of empathy, but he very clearly feels strongly about this, so it's worth sitting down and having a reasonable conversation about.\n\nAlso, because no one else has mentioned it, and I know it would be an issue for me, you might want to ask if boyfriend's actual problem is having the dog in the room while you're having sex. Because that will be much easier to solve.", "NTA - doggo is family.  now if doggo was sleeping on your bed, thats a problem.  but he's got his own bed.  if bf can't deal with that it's best you know about it now before you waste too much time on him.", "NAH. There is no easy answer here. Yes it\u2019s your place, your pup was there first and you\u2019re well within your rights to not want to switch up the routine. Your doggo is hugely important to you and that\u2019s more than understandable. I absolutely love dogs and love having them around.\n\nI have also however been in the situation of your partner. I dated a guy whose dog would sleep in the same bedroom and, as a light sleeper, it drove me nuts. You also mention your dog is large: that can make a difference. My dogs have always slept in another room. Not that you\u2019re wrong, at all, I just can hear everything and they can shuffle around, snore, pant etc\u2026.You mention your partner didn\u2019t grow up with pets, so whilst the situation is hard for you to understand, that\u2019s just his preference. \n\nYour preference for doggo in your room is more than ok, as is his for not wanting your pupper in the room you both sleep in. This is about current compatibility, and if either of you can adapt/compromise. I hope you can, and best of luck.", "NTA - the dog has been their longer and you know what is best for him, it's your house. Also, I'm sure your BF moves around and snores which might distract you or the dog, just saying...", "oh my god, doggo has been with you for *years.* one year is nothing next to that. NTA. *he* can sleep in the landing lol", "[deleted]", "Everyone is different, I like animals but I would never dream of allowing a pet on my bed ever and especially when I sleep. I do have allergies and such but even without them, it\u2019s not happening\n\nHowever I understand people are close with their pets and can\u2019t imagine a reality where their pets don\u2019t sleep with them and that is okay, cute even.\n\nNone of these realities are wrong, they are just different, there is no AH or badguy simply from the differences\n\nHowever, if you combine these two people, it\u2019s chaos. Your dog is part of your home and it is his right to sleep in the bed so naturally you don\u2019t understand why the dog should be made to be put out.\nYour partner doesn\u2019t even believe the dog should be in the bed so they don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t put the dog out. \nTo you, the dog snoring isn\u2019t a big deal and you are able to sleep through but you don\u2019t see the fact that your partner is struggling to sleep, as a direct result of the dog, as a big issue. disturbances in sleep are serious no matter how fickle. \nI see why your partner feels upset that you don\u2019t seem to think it\u2019s a big deal.\nYour partner however also fully knows your relationship and habits with your dog and still wants to sleep in your home. They could simply not sleepover or could understand that you too have completely different ideas on the boundaries of the dog. He knew the situation when he got into it and chose to continue and so it\u2019s weird that he is now trying to change something that you have always done.\nThen comes the fact that the dog takes a portion of the bed, for you, youre used to it and you don\u2019t even notice it, to your partner it\u2019s a huge adjustment in their comfortability whilst they sleep and again affects the amount of sleep they get. \nHowever, your dog should absolutely be able to go where it wants and it\u2019s comfort should also be considered. This is also what they are used to, they\u2019re used to sleeping there and i know changing it habits is probably confusing to him. Its a no win situation. It\u2019s up to you which one matter the most to you and act accordingly Z\nBut you can\u2019t negate the physical issues that your partner has with the current routine\nNAH/ ESH", "NTA.

However I do think you coming here for an outside opinion means that you're not fully dismissing him, so that's a very good thing. \n\n>I accept that I am putting my dogs wellbeing above his currently\n\nAnd you are well within your right to do so. My comment was more about wondering why everyone is calling your b/f an AH (by their NTA judgement) when I still haven't seen a single comment actually explaining why he is one. Anyone wanting decent sleep is not only perfectly reasonable but should be expected. \n\nYou definitely should have a conversation and compromise, if he isn't willing to compromise then *that* would make him an AH. But keep in mind people do sleep differently - just because some people can sleep with earplugs doesn't mean everyone can, and honestly even if I could sleep with earplugs I wouldn't want to sleep with them long-term. I think everyone needs to be comfortable, and that might end up meaning you're not compatible sleepers.", "Where does OP mention that \"he's not at all considering how this impacts the dog's health\" or anything similar? I think you've made that assumption based on \n\n>He hates having the dog in the bedroom\n\nbut that is in no way the same thing at all - he hates the noise, NOT the pet. And OP has even mentioned in another comment that he loves her dog and she jokingly suspects the dog loves him more than her. It would be ridiculous for me to equate a mother hating the noise from having her own baby in her bedroom with her \"not at all considering how it impacts her baby's health\" (rephrasing your comment). Yet that's what you're trying to do.\n\nIt certainly is possible he is prioritizing his own health over the dog's, as many people might, but for you to assume he has \"not at all\" considered the dog is awfully naive. Ultimately this requires some compromise, but calling him an AH for something that OP hasn't even mentioned of him is pretty ridiculous.", "For the dog?

I think I'll suggest a white noise machine over earplugs as a starter, because like you said not everyone wants to sleep with earplugs, but I'll mention them as an option and see if he's open to at least trying one or both options and go from there. Not sure how open he will be to the ideas but I do want to try and find something that works for all of us.\n\nI don't personally think he's an AH, but I do think that he knew the dog was part of the \"package\" so we need to figure something out if this is going to work long term.\n\nI'll update on how the conversation goes!", "Because he still wants the dog to sleep out on the landing despite it negatively impacting the dog's health. Not sure how it gets any clearer than that.\n\nOr his girlfriend's health for that matter, since it's ruining her sleep too.\n\nHe can hate the noise all he wants, but that's why a separate sleeping situation would be ideal, then all three of them get their sleep.", "You also mention your dog is large: that can make a difference.

She belonged to his son and son's (now ex) girlfriend. Son worked full time, gf would shut the dog in the kitchen when she was a puppy and go off with her friends all day. Dog has separation anxiety (understandably) and gets distressed if she thinks she's been left alone. She sleeps in our room, on a dog bed in a kids pop-up tent, because she feels safe in there. She used to sleep under the bed (her choice) until she got too big to get under it - she likes an enclosed space. Yes, the tent takes up a bit of space in the room, and it would be much easier for us if she would sleep on her bed downstairs, but she would be so unhappy if we tried to make her do that, so it's not even a consideration. We've even arraged our working hours around making sure she's never left alone, and if there's ever a time where one of us can't stay with her (e.g. hospital appointments), we will take her across town to my daughter or to an elderly friend so that she doesn't have to be left alone. Doggo is still anxious, but not to the point that she will injure herself trying to get out to find me or my OH (which would totally happen if she was left completely alone). She likes visiting both my daughter and my friend, but she is soooo relieved when we pick her up. \n\nAll the above rambling is just to say - you do what's best for you and Doggo, and if bf don't like it, tough shit, dude.\n\nNTA, totally, completely, 100%.", "Agreed. \n\nOP is NTA.

If they have poor experiences during those periods, their fears are reinforced and can result in lifelong anxieties.

I'd figure out how to fix my own sleep situation to make it work.\n\nTalk to your boyfriend when you two are in a good mood and it's not bedtime.  Tell him you care for him a lot.
