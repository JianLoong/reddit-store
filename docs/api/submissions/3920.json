It was a normal aspect of life to save as much money as possible; but when I had to spend money, to extract as much value as possible. Despite being in a much better position today those behaviours never went away.\n\nYesterday my university friends \\[30-36 M & F\\] and I \\[30M\\] caught up over dinner at a restaurant called HaiDiLao. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, it's basically an exorbitantly overpriced hot pot restaurant, that justifies its pricing by offering an assortment of complimentary gifts that you can take at your pleasure. For context, there were 8 of us, and together we spent $509.71; a not insignificant sum. So, yes, I was going to get as much of the complimentary offerings as possible. I loaded up on a small bag worth of the snacks, got a dozen hair ties, and even negotiated with the waitress to give us three of the take-home soup base packages (normally you're only given one). Did I need any of it? No. To be honest, most of the reason why I did it was just to be good fun.\n\nAnd it was good fun. Almost everyone there had a good laugh from my antics. Even the restaurant's staff members. Well, everyone except one person: Reginald \\[32M\\]. If I'm going to be honest I've never liked Reginald. I've always thought he walked around with a 2 metre pole stuck up his ass. Specifically, he liked to always act as if he is some high society twat despite the fact of everyone at dinner he might just make the least. As we were leaving the restaurant Reginald commented, \"That was so embarrassing. I'm never eating out with you again.\". Something about his tone just made his comment stood out from the banter. So I asked him to explain what he meant by the comment.\n\nReginald basically went on to say that how I acted was of someone that is beneath him, and that in other circumstances he wouldn't interact with people like me. At this point other members of the group started chiming in with reactions ranging from \"What is wrong with you, Reginald?\" and \"I think JDP-Phoenix is just trying to be funny\". If Reginald would have backed down and apologised, I would have let things go. But he stood his ground and said, \"I'm just being honest. JDP-Phoenix acted low class and I don't want to be associated with that behaviour.\". Here's where I may be the asshole. I know full well that Reginald is extremely insecure about how much he makes. He's expressed that to the group a few times when he gets overboard with his drinking. Despite being cognisant of that, I fired back with \"Firstly, everyone else enjoyed my jokes. Even if the staff. So what's the problem? Secondly, I literally make multiples of you, mate. So calm it with the elitism.\".\n\nBefore things got more heated my partner pulled me away and we went home. Earlier today I was told by my friends that my comment really hurt Reginald, and he spent Saturday night drinking himself into a stupor.\n\nDid I go too far? Or was I just \"being honest\"?", "created_utc": 1670154820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc7yct/aita_for_responding_to_my_friend_calling_me_low/", "score": 2041, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Class is about how one carries themselves, neither you nor Reginald have much expertise in that area", "NTA. I fail to see how you are responsible for Reginald's income, insecurities, and prejudices. His comments were rude and obnoxious and you defended yourself. If he never goes to dinner with you again, everyone did everyone a favor.", "NTA at all! Sounds like he's more bothered about everyone thinking he's high class and rich than he is about anything else - someone genuinely rich would usually be unphased by your amusing behaviour. \n\nHe sounds like the \"don't you know who I am\" type, with a touch of small man syndrome.

I doubt it.\n\nAnd drinking himself into a stupor just because of that?  Reginald has issues, and you did not cause them.\n\nMaybe a slight TA because you knowingly retaliated directly onto his known insecurity, but meh.

I would make off like a bandit at that restaurant, too. You\u2019re my kinda people.\n\nPeople can dish it but not take it. He insulted you first and you insulted him back.

He later goes on to criticize an uncle for also being a gambler (hypocritical, I might add).\n\n- He represented a company that was being accused of something really bad (and seemed guilty, based on OP\u2019s comments) just for the extra money, and when a cousin questioned how he could have such bad morals, OP lashed back at them.\n\nI don\u2019t really have time to go into the other ones but, they mostly consist of OP being stolen from people or them messing with some of his expensive stuff.

He was talked about for the rest of the evening.", "The staff laughing is on par with the female colleagues who laughs at the office \u201cbanter\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t find OP\u2019s antics funny in the slightest and he\u2019s absolutely one of their arseholes of the day.", "Former waitress here. Nope, I don't know a single waiter/waitress who would think of it as funny. We would habe laughed at this because there is nothing else you can do if a group of wannabe upper-class people show up and behave like this (unless you had a cool supervisor who would have your back if they try to argue). People like OP were the worse  and I bet he and his friends gave little to no tips.", "Gotta give it to OP, they obviously learned how to be manipulative in a very charming way! \n\nI mean, when he introduced the villain as *Reginald* I literally heard the *dun, dun, DUN!*\n\nWhat a great choice. \n\nAnd OP is right, we all learn behaviors from the way we are brought up that served us and helped us survive BUT the fact that OP felt the need to put that upfront, as a justification, tells me they are likely aware that while they make their behavior \"good fun\" *and* felt more than confident that they would get away with it, suggesting that this is something they do fairly often in a variety of circumstances... Doesn't mean they aren't aware that they are \"pulling\" something somewhat unacceptable, at the very least.\n\nJust because you're a charming scamp doesn't mean you're not a scamp.", "Working in food and beverage you have to smile and be friendly to the guests. Trust me, they seriously went to the back of the house and talked some serious shit about you.\n\nYTA for real. You abused the restaurant's gracious amenities. The bill wasn't even that high for eight people. Where I live that's average.", "Yeah came here to say that too ... I bet the staff were mortified for you and were just happy to see the back of you . YTA and you sound  exhausting to be around ... hope you left a good tip at least .", "If the bread sticks are unlimited why can't I shove them in my backpack?", "Honestly\u2026 yeah. I\u2019m poor but I went to go eat at Haidilao a couple months ago, and the staff actively tried to get us to bring leftovers and stuff home (we didn\u2019t take it cause 6 hour drive home) but not to the extent that OP went. They just offered for us to take some snacks, a container of soup, the hair tie they offered me, and whatever else.", "Yeah lol I grew up poor and frugal and my attitude is to think whether I actually need something, whether it's free or not.", "Wonder if op ever waited tables since they're oblivious to the smile and nod to deal with the customer technique.", "Wow, really spot on!", "Op is the kind of guy who thinks that strippers are into him. \n\nYTA", "Exactly", "Agreed.", ">As an American, this reads very British to me.\n\nAs a British person, I see what you mean about the class comments, but it's really \"off\" in terms of how British people understand class and money.  I don't know if I can articulate it very well but... \nYou can have really rich people who are low class, and some upper class people can be poor (maybe asset rich and cash poor).  \nThere's a large part of class distinction which is more about how you behave and how you treat others as well as your upbringing etc. \n\nI'm afraid to say I'm 'Team Reginald' here, specifically because OP isn't just taking the allocated freebies, he's asking for extra stuff.  And it's one thing to do that if he was dining with just a few people, but it's a different dynamic to do that in a group setting.  The other thing that is 'low-class' behaviour is hitting back with an insult and bragging about how much he earns.", "Yes,  Australians like to think of themselves as a classless society,  but they are not at all (source I\u2019m Australian and British and experienced more snobbery in Australia", "Use of dollars is deeply un-British lol", "Could be Singapore too.", "Not as much at all to be honest. I'm sure we have at least our fair share of uptight millionare cockheads but generally the playing field is a bit more flat, doctors are mates with tradies are mates with lawyers are mates with retail staff etc.", "OP owns watches worth several thousand dollars *each*, which makes this entire story even worse. Who makes a big fucking deal out of spending $60 on what essentially is an all-you-can-eat place if they obviously have that kind of money?\n\nThat's not being frugal, that's just being a cheapskate.", "I went out with a friend to one of those hipster burger bars a few weeks ago. With a shared appetizer, entree, shared dessert and one drink it came to almost $60. Spending that much is fairly standard if you\u2019re going out for a sit down dinner that isn\u2019t fast food.", "seriously! i think elitism/classism is abhorrent, it's also not tied to your bank balance by any means (social class i mean not fiscal class), but if anyone's acting 'lower class' it's OP because of their scrounging. manners maketh man!", "This is what jumped out to me. OP thinks he proved he was \u201chigh class\u201d by pointing out how much he makes. It\u2019s just the opposite, dude.", "Yeah, there's a clear difference between new money and old money. In my experience most people that show off their wealth and equate wealth with class are new money. I know folks who hold actual titles and are from wealthy families, yet they never show it off like people who are new money.", "Ah. HaiDiLao is also in Australia, where OP's post history suggest they are. \n\nA typical restaurant meal is more than $20 but $60 for hotpot still seems pretty excessive to me (also in Australia), depending on how much the drinks bill was.", "Don\u2019t let our Canadian neighbors off the hook. It\u2019s the same there. And really, once you get used to it, it\u2019s not a big deal at all. I remember being confused about adding tax when I was eight years old and spending my first allowance money, but after that, it becomes second nature. This is one of those things that non-Americans on Reddit find completely baffling but almost 400 million North Americans can navigate it without much of a problem.", "Yes it\u2019s added at the register and it\u2019s based on state and even city. Also, different places have different exclusions for sales taxes. We are used to it and expect it, but I can see how baffling it is for people not used to it.", "Yup. You go out, sit down and order a coffee that says it\u2019s $2. And the bill comes and it\u2019s $2.33. And then you have to tip the waitress. Generally that\u2019s 20%, but at least a dollar. So the cup of coffee listed at $2 is now $3.33.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many t times I\u2019ve been at the register with a little kid excited that they have exactly $1.50 for a candy bar, only to realize it\u2019s $1.78.", "Yes, exactly how it works. It\u2019s a terrible pain if you are on a tight budget and trying to do the math to see if you have enough money to afford something.", "Yes, it truly is the most baffling system.", "A lot of items come with the pre-tax price listed on them from the manufacturer and tax amounts are different from city to city and state to state. The tax is added at the register to make it easier for the stores. If the tax amount rises, items don't have to be repriced.", "Yup. Tax varies by location and is based on a combination of state and local taxes. \n\nSales tax where I live is 8.25%. I could drive a bit into the next county and pay a bit less.", "Yeah we're ridiculous. Even different items are taxed at different rates at the same store and it is all dependent on city/county/state. Food might have no tax. However, prepared food might be taxed (so think buying ingredients to make a sandwich = no tax but buying a ready made sandwich = taxed). Clothing might be one tax rate. Baby supplies or feminine hygiene products another tax rate. \n\nGo to the county over? Different! Go to a totally different state? Could be WILDLY different...\n\nI was just at a store and was taxed at 8% on some products and 4% on others. \n\nI hate it here. \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit: clarification", "Had a teacher compare what wait staff in the US make to a form of \u201cbarely legal slavery\u201d since they aren\u2019t offered anything close to a living wage", "I hope your excluding tip income from that amount because as a tipped server the fed minimum(when I worked) was 2.35 plus tips to  bring it to at least the federal minimum (7.25) of course this varies by state and their minimum wages. If you don't make enough in tips to equal minimum wage the restaurant needs to pay you minimum wage for those hours. I know because it happened once. Very bad day to have a morning shift.\n\nSo yes my weekly check from the restaurant was 20 bucks <after taxes on tipped wages> and what not.  But what I took home all including was well over 500 a week. (Went a lot further back then.)", "Then he should have sued his employer. The law says that you need to get at least minimum wage.", "That's on quite a different level than the US though. I'd leave 80 bucks on average on a 400 bill.

I have laughed at customers horrible asshole \u2018jokes many times before shit talking them for a damn week. If I\u2019d had someone like op it would have been the same. Op wasn\u2019t being funny and the staff probably shit talked him for days after. Honestly from me it\u2019s closer to a yta because again, I am poor and I wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with someone who behaved like that either.", "He probably thinks strippers genuinely like him.\n\nYTA, OP.", "Oh fair enough, I missed that. I specifically meant the focus on class status. I\u2019ll take my downvotes as the ugly American, I suppose, god forbid someone make a mistake.", "I used to work in a menswear shop selling expensive labels and there would be repeat customers the staff and owners knew were rich and they would still ask for deals and discounts.\n\nRich people are cheapskates", "If you\u2019re in a city and doing a long, full menu with friends it can be hard to avoid $60 between drinks, apps, and dessert.", "Don\u2019t get it twisted tho, old money are still mostly POSs and cheap af", "I do know here in the NE US for decent hot pot you're likely looking at probably $40-50 per person by the time it all adds up at the end.\n\nHowever, that's still not \"exorbitant\" to eat out. Idk what actual high end restaurants charge in Oz for a meal, but when my fiance and I go \"fancy\" for a special occasion, it's usually in the $100 per person range, and that's not even the priciest fine dining in our city!", "HaiDiLao is also in singapore", "That worst of the hassle is when you get to other states and find out their taxes are different. I went to Florida once and was ready with exact change but was so confused when my $6 item was over $7 instead of $6.60. As long as I\u2019m in my own territory it doesn\u2019t bother me much", "Yeah, when my daughter was younger I just paid the tax for her. Now, since she's 12, I just tell her to add 10% (our tax is 8.25%, but why calculate that?) to what she wants to buy to make sure she has enough.", "In some cases yes, but I have plenty of server/bartender friends who \u201crely on tips\u201d and can easily make $500+ in a night of working. That\u2019s why so many servers fight FOR tipping in the US. Really depends on location.", "Which funnily enough, this whole tip culture has its origins in racism.", "I personally would leave 10% in the UK. Most people I know would. 80 bucks in the US would be pretty close to standard. Certainly not unusually generous. As I said it is different in the UK than the US but most people here in the UK would leave around 10% in OPs situation.", "I doubt even his friends found it funny. I would have been slightly embarrassed if someone I was with acted like that, but often embarrassment comes out as nervous laughter, and sometimes laughing along with something is the quickest way to get it to stop.\n\nIf OP thinks $60/person for dinner is \u201cexorbitantly overpriced\u201d I\u2019m not going to trust his assessment of what \u201ceveryone thought was funny\u201d!", "I worked retail for over 12 years. The \"It must be free without a price tag on it\" joke is not orginal. But I pretended to laugh every time.", "I just said the exact same thing.", "Yeah, rich people can still be cheapskates.\n\nOP is confusing money with class when they are not the same thing in the slightest.", "yeah and its not \"oh thats how they got/stay rich\" behavior either, since they're spending unneccessary money on ridiculously overpriced luxury items in the first place. They just want to have that luxury item and also pay as little as possible for it.", "Oh there is a high chance they found it funny because they don't consider waiters and waitresses as people. They sound exactly like the type of people who behave like idiots who they think they own the place and don't pay any tips."]}
