{"id": 3920, "submission_id": "zc7yct", "title": "AITA for responding to my friend calling me \"low class\" by reminding him that I make his salary multiple times over?", "selftext": "I grew up extremely poor. It was a normal aspect of life to save as much money as possible; but when I had to spend money, to extract as much value as possible. Despite being in a much better position today those behaviours never went away.\n\nYesterday my university friends \\[30-36 M & F\\] and I \\[30M\\] caught up over dinner at a restaurant called HaiDiLao. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, it's basically an exorbitantly overpriced hot pot restaurant, that justifies its pricing by offering an assortment of complimentary gifts that you can take at your pleasure. For context, there were 8 of us, and together we spent $509.71; a not insignificant sum. So, yes, I was going to get as much of the complimentary offerings as possible. I loaded up on a small bag worth of the snacks, got a dozen hair ties, and even negotiated with the waitress to give us three of the take-home soup base packages (normally you're only given one). Did I need any of it? No. To be honest, most of the reason why I did it was just to be good fun.\n\nAnd it was good fun. Almost everyone there had a good laugh from my antics. Even the restaurant's staff members. Well, everyone except one person: Reginald \\[32M\\]. If I'm going to be honest I've never liked Reginald. I've always thought he walked around with a 2 metre pole stuck up his ass. Specifically, he liked to always act as if he is some high society twat despite the fact of everyone at dinner he might just make the least. As we were leaving the restaurant Reginald commented, \"That was so embarrassing. I'm never eating out with you again.\". Something about his tone just made his comment stood out from the banter. So I asked him to explain what he meant by the comment.\n\nReginald basically went on to say that how I acted was of someone that is beneath him, and that in other circumstances he wouldn't interact with people like me. At this point other members of the group started chiming in with reactions ranging from \"What is wrong with you, Reginald?\" and \"I think JDP-Phoenix is just trying to be funny\". If Reginald would have backed down and apologised, I would have let things go. But he stood his ground and said, \"I'm just being honest. JDP-Phoenix acted low class and I don't want to be associated with that behaviour.\". Here's where I may be the asshole. I know full well that Reginald is extremely insecure about how much he makes. He's expressed that to the group a few times when he gets overboard with his drinking. Despite being cognisant of that, I fired back with \"Firstly, everyone else enjoyed my jokes. Even if the staff. So what's the problem? Secondly, I literally make multiples of you, mate. So calm it with the elitism.\".\n\nBefore things got more heated my partner pulled me away and we went home. Earlier today I was told by my friends that my comment really hurt Reginald, and he spent Saturday night drinking himself into a stupor.\n\nDid I go too far? Or was I just \"being honest\"?", "created_utc": 1670154820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc7yct/aita_for_responding_to_my_friend_calling_me_low/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What Reginald said was poorly worded and elitist but you didn\u2019t have to double down and hit below the belt. Be thankful you can (both) afford to go to a meal like that with friends. \n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s low class to shit on people\u2019s financial status/choices.", "Just a guess, you're not nearly as funny as you think... and making more money has nothing to do with how you act. We all know money can't buy you class, or in your case funny jokes.", "Well, it is pretty rude to try to get as much free crap as possible out of wait staff who are paid to be nice to you & have to act like whatever the customer does is great or lose their jobs. If you can afford to pay $60 or $70 on dinner, do you really need to game the staff for hair ties & soup packets? You\u2019re 30, not a teenager. I can imagine the way the staff laughed at you after you left. \n\nFYI, it isn\u2019t money that makes people low class or upper class, and tbh, only someone who is low class thinks that. Reginald might have gone a bit overboard with what he said, but maybe he, too, was \u201cjust being honest\u201d. YTA for saying that you are better than Reginald because you make more money than he does.", "YTA \n\n\nI'd be embarrassed to eat with you, too. You kept asking the waitstaff to give you free stuff, and as workers that rely on tips, they had to be awkward and play along with your \"jokes\". There is a difference between making your money go far and taking advantage of a situation. \n\n\n\nYou asked Reginald what he meant when he said he was embarrassed by your behavior. Your behavior was absolutely classless, regardless of your \"economic class\".", "ESH. My guess is most of your party was actually embarrassed by you. $60ish per person is not extravagant for a big group dinner and the restaurant doesn\u2019t owe you anything. I probably wouldn\u2019t have said anything to you, but I would have distanced myself and snuck the waitstaff an extra cash tip for dealing with you. Loud people who think they are funny, rarely are. They gave you shit to shut you up. Not because they liked you. \n\nAnd then you got called out on your bad behavior and you couldn\u2019t take it so you lashed out. I think he took it too far as well, which is why you\u2019re both assholes, but you\u2019re the bigger one.", "ESH. \n\nReginald was a bit dickish about his discomfort at your behavior.\n\nBut let\u2019s get something clear. Money/income level does not equal class. And your behavior was classless.", "YTA. Uncalled for comment. Sure, you were welcome to mooch as much as you could at HDL but your friends are also welcome to find that embarrassing and not want to be associated with that behavior", "ESH. The more you try to prove yourself to Reginald the less he thinks of you. Is he an ass for that? Yes. Are you an ass for fixating on money and thinking it matters if a random dude thinks you low class? Yes.\nHe is insecure about his money while you seem to be insecure about your past poverty.", "YTA. Dinner was less than $65 per person - as such, trying \u201cto extract as much value as possible\u201d was gross and obnoxious.", "YTA.  Your behavior in the restaurant was obnoxious, arrogant and entitled, and no, it has NOTHING to do with growing up poor.     That's just the behavior of scammers and narcissists.\n\nI wouldn't eat a meal with you either.  Trust me, the staff weren't amused.  They were frustrated, confused and embarrassed and just wanted your obnoxious self to leave.  \n\n\nFinal note, your friend calling you low-class had NOTHING to do with your salary.  he was referring to your lack of manners and morals.            \n\n\nIt doesn't surprise me you decided to make it about money, though. \n\nGrow up.", "ESH - telling someone that they should shut up because you make a lot more money than them is\u2026 uncool. \n\nReginald was also quite uncool to make a stink about you maximizing the freebies.\n\nTerrible etiquette, all around.", "ESH\n\nComing from money, having money and / or making money doesn't automatically mean \"having class.\"  \n\n\n> Having class involves good manners, politeness, pride without showboating, empathy, humility, and an abundance of self-control.

You can see it in their body language and the way they carry themselves.\n\n/from google", "ESH - Reginald sounds like a huge jerk and calling someone \u201clow-class\u201d is completely inappropriate. Everyone in your group was having fun, and nobody lost out from your actions. \n\nBragging about how much you make is so seedy in my opinion though. Money doesn\u2019t necessarily make you more important and valid, and while Reginald is someone who probably deserves it, there could be people in your group who are struggling financially or worried about money, and for you to outright use \u201cI make more money than you\u201d as an insult or \u201cplay a winning card\u201d, it\u2019s just really condescending and elitist.\n\nESH, I think it\u2019s probably best if you stop hanging out with Reginald if you both get on each others nerves.", "YTA, class has nothing to do with income.  as you've shown in your post.  Like telling us what Daniel \"basically\" said instead of what he actually said to make it seem more in your favor. \n\nI have no idea how much my friends make, and find it odd you not only do, but seem to rank them by it.", "YTA.  Reginald was criticizing your behavior. You went on an attack about how much he earns.", "YTA. money can\u2019t buy class. wait staff are just trying to do their job, I promise you they don\u2019t find your \u201cantics\u201d funny, just exhausting. also\u2026 $500 bill for 8 people isn\u2019t even that much? like $60 per person, that\u2019s hardly \u201cexorbitant\u201d and doesn\u2019t justify being obnoxious to the wait staff and haggling with them for free stuff.", "From your other comment it seems R chose the expensive place and wanted to control the mood.

Unless the restaurant is in tough financial straits, NTA.", "NTA..\nSome saying about people living in glass houses should not be throwing rocks", "ESH, Reginald sounds like a total prick, but you sound like an insecure AH as well. \nInstead of going for his known insecurities you could've also just said that you're rather low class having fun than elite with a sucky attitude in life' or something like that.", "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. NTA", "ESH\n\nThough the hoarding of complimentary items was cringe-worthy, it was rude of R to comment on it so publicly. Not sure if it's a backhanded insult to your impoverished bg (does he even know?) but that tacky behavior can come from rich or poor people. \n\nHowever, your salary retort was more offensive and worse AHishness.\n\nOn the bright side, you two will probably steer clear of each other.", "Very confused by the people on here saying that class is about behavior and not wealth. Literally the entire class system is based on money. If someone is saying that you\u2019re \u201cacting low class,\u201d they are saying you\u2019re acting like person from a low socioeconomic status. If they\u2019re using that phrase as an insult, they\u2019re simultaneously insulting poor people-saying poor people have bad behavior. \n\nReginald insinuated your behavior was bad because you were acting like a poor person. You told him you have more money than him. If he didn\u2019t want to be reminded that he isn\u2019t as wealthy as you, he shouldn\u2019t have made an income-based insult. He fucked around and found out. \n\nNTA.", "You met him with the same energy he came out, at you with. He said worse.", "NTA . Reginald made it a point to criticize you about how you acted lower class, which is a way of saying you sounded poor, and he wouldn't associate with you again.\nSo your come-back regarding his income vs.  yours was appropriate. He went home and drank himself into a supor? That's entirely on him. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA\n\nBuddy Reginald kept poking you, and you poked back (and won, in my opinion). It's kind of like someone punching someone over and over \"come on hit me, hit me, hit me\" and then you knock them the fuck out. They start it, you finished it. \n\nI WILL agree with others though, that just because you earn more money, doesn't make you higher class. Class is about how one carries themselves, neither you nor Reginald have much expertise in that area", "NTA. I fail to see how you are responsible for Reginald's income, insecurities, and prejudices. His comments were rude and obnoxious and you defended yourself. If he never goes to dinner with you again, everyone did everyone a favor.", "NTA at all! Sounds like he's more bothered about everyone thinking he's high class and rich than he is about anything else - someone genuinely rich would usually be unphased by your amusing behaviour. \n\nHe sounds like the \"don't you know who I am\" type, with a touch of small man syndrome. Like he'd make himself poor to buy flashy car just to ensure everyone thought he had money.", "I would say NTA.\nDon't dish out if you can't receive.\nHe went after you first, but then breaks down when you retaliate? \nDid he ever consider that it might be a sensitive subject for you before calling you low class?  I doubt it.\n\nAnd drinking himself into a stupor just because of that?  Reginald has issues, and you did not cause them.\n\nMaybe a slight TA because you knowingly retaliated directly onto his known insecurity, but meh.  I would have done the same to someone I didn't really like in the first place.", "NTA he has it coming! Good for you for stepping up! You sound like a fun time. And free hair ties in a hot pot restaurant sounds so cool lol", "NTA. I mean maybe the place you went to isn't one Reginald would be comfortable returning to, but it sounds like you didn't do anything not part of the typical experience there.", "Lmao NTA but damn thats gunny", "Nta because he provoked it", "NTA. \n\nYou wanna be friends? I would make off like a bandit at that restaurant, too. You\u2019re my kinda people.\n\nPeople can dish it but not take it. He insulted you first and you insulted him back. All\u2019s fair.", "There is a difference between having money and acting lower class.\n\nBut that being said, I don\u2019t think you acted lower class\u2026right up until the point that you said you earnt more than him.\n\nHe was being a snob, and deserved it though \ud83d\ude00", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
