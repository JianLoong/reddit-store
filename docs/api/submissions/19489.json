Turns out were going to the mountains. While we have been here before, everyone is still really excited. The entire trip has been planned out so far. And we are all ready to go on vacation.Not only that but our grandparents are coming with us. So everyone is really excited for this trip. \n\nThough due to their age my grandparents don't want to dive 6+ hours to a mountain cabin, so their riding with us. With the addition of them, the total going in 7 people and its hard to find a vehicle that would fit us comfortably . So the solution is for someone to take another car, and I volunteered to take my truck along with my brother. While this fixed the crowding problem, it caused another to pop up.\n\nMy sister wants to ride with my brother and I. We have the room for her, and it would allow for the other car to have more room. But I don't want her to ride, for a number of reason. Mainly she is the worlds worst backseat driver.  No matter how well i drive somethings always wrong. I'm too close to one side, or I'm not checking blind-spots enough. Rather than calmly point out my mistake she screams at me that I cant drive and often demands i pull over and switch with her.\n\n Then there are a number of smaller reasons. She has to have complete control of music and ac, she has to be in the passenger seat, and  she is the only one who can choose rest-stops, restaurants, and gas station.Then the worst is she takes her damn shoes and sock off, then puts here nasty ass feet on the dash. When these things combine its honestly impossible to focus on the road as she gets load and mean when we don't listen to her. \n\nThe thing is she sees this as a sibling road-trip and away out of riding with all of the \"old people\". She has vowed to be calm and has agreed to stop backseat driving. But i don't trust her, and if I'm driving up a mountain in the dark I want more than a promise that nothing will happen. \n\n If i tell her no she will freakout before we leave. But i cant deal with her and navigate the interstate/mountain roads. So its essentially choosing between the lesser of two evils. A freak out at home before we leave  or on the middle of the interstate .  Id rather not have conflict at all but it unavoidable at this point, and i don't want to ruin vacation over the car arrangement.", "created_utc": 1686435961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146d142/wibta_for_refusing_to_let_my_sister_ride_with_my/", "score": 606, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly I think the backseat driver issue is reason enough. I'm assuming you will be traveling quite a distance on highways, and her screaming at you is just dangerous.

Driver gets last say on music and stops, you can take things under advisement but ultimately you get final say. A family member of mine is very similar in terms of backseat driving and anxiety around the car. I really like a calm drive if I\u2019m behind the wheel, I like listening to the music I like or podcasts that suit me because it makes it easier to concentrate. It got to the point she shrieked one day and startled me so hard I jerked the wheel and almost crashed and that\u2019s when I put my foot down. I said under no circumstances can she behave like that or id stop the car and she could get out, she could drive (she is an anxious driver so not an option) or she would have to sit in the back seat with a blindfold. Needless to say she had found the self control to not shriek and backseat drive while I\u2019m driving. \n\nIf you truely cannot dodge her tell her if she carries on you absolutely will pull over at the next truck stop and leave her, no exceptions, then follow through.", "You're all the asshole, how about you sort your shit out and just get along for the duration of the vacation your parents are treating you to?", "NTA, from what you said, I would also not want to drive with her for even a small trip let along a 6+ hour one. Her saying she will be good is nice but your history with her shows other wise. I would tell her that if she can show she wont act that way before the trip after this one she can ride with you for that, but not this one.", "NTA. I doubt she could behave no matter what she says. Let your brother know she wants to come, if he confronts her that's fine. You could confront her too but it seems your personality is nicer and doesn't allow you to do that. Why not let him? Also, someone had a sweet idea of offering your grandparents to ride with you instead in turns, maybe that's what you would like to do?
