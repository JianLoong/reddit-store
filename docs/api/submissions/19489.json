Turns out were going to the mountains. While we have been here before, everyone is still really excited. The entire trip has been planned out so far. And we are all ready to go on vacation.Not only that but our grandparents are coming with us. So everyone is really excited for this trip. \n\nThough due to their age my grandparents don't want to dive 6+ hours to a mountain cabin, so their riding with us. With the addition of them, the total going in 7 people and its hard to find a vehicle that would fit us comfortably . So the solution is for someone to take another car, and I volunteered to take my truck along with my brother. While this fixed the crowding problem, it caused another to pop up.\n\nMy sister wants to ride with my brother and I. We have the room for her, and it would allow for the other car to have more room. But I don't want her to ride, for a number of reason. Mainly she is the worlds worst backseat driver.  No matter how well i drive somethings always wrong. I'm too close to one side, or I'm not checking blind-spots enough. Rather than calmly point out my mistake she screams at me that I cant drive and often demands i pull over and switch with her.\n\n Then there are a number of smaller reasons. She has to have complete control of music and ac, she has to be in the passenger seat, and  she is the only one who can choose rest-stops, restaurants, and gas station.Then the worst is she takes her damn shoes and sock off, then puts here nasty ass feet on the dash. When these things combine its honestly impossible to focus on the road as she gets load and mean when we don't listen to her. \n\nThe thing is she sees this as a sibling road-trip and away out of riding with all of the \"old people\". She has vowed to be calm and has agreed to stop backseat driving. But i don't trust her, and if I'm driving up a mountain in the dark I want more than a promise that nothing will happen. \n\n If i tell her no she will freakout before we leave. But i cant deal with her and navigate the interstate/mountain roads. So its essentially choosing between the lesser of two evils. A freak out at home before we leave  or on the middle of the interstate .  Id rather not have conflict at all but it unavoidable at this point, and i don't want to ruin vacation over the car arrangement.", "created_utc": 1686435961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146d142/wibta_for_refusing_to_let_my_sister_ride_with_my/", "score": 254, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly I think the backseat driver issue is reason enough. I'm assuming you will be traveling quite a distance on highways, and her screaming at you is just dangerous.

Also putting her feet on the dashboard is a stupid thing to do, can cause her more harm if an accident happens.", "NTA that kind passenger is just dangerous and her putting her feet on the dash is also super dangerous.

Mix up the music on the radio, switch regularly from music they like to stuff you like (that won't drive the gparent nutty), and try and get stories about whichever parent of yours they raised, as future ammo!\n\nAnd I'm guessing your parents are encouraging your sister to ride with you because they know she sucks.", "Nta.\nI do not drive with one of my family members in the car for the same reason.

I would just flat out say no if she asks again.  Tell her all the reasons why and if she flips out use that as proof that she can not remain calm and in control of herself and her emotions.

Also tell her not put her feet on the dash because if something happens she is most like to break her legs automatically (from stories I have heard on internet and EMS people I know). Also tell her that IF she does ride with she isn\u2019t gonna have control over everything especially since she isn\u2019t the driver and the only person in the truck.

You only agree as long as the folks and grandparents agree to let you be the lead car, AND with the understanding that at the FIRST infraction, you will pull over and send her to the old-smobile. \n\nEveryone has to agree or no go. \n\nAlso, very publicly start taking bets on how long it will be before she fucks around and finds out. Let grandma and grandpa in on the action. Folks too. Price is right rules. Closest guess without going over. $1/guess.

Also, tell her to keep her damn feet away from the airbags.", " NTA When I started reading, I thought your sister was 6 from your description of her behaviour.

She knows she's screaming at someone who is driving.", "This is a fantastic idea!  The non-driving brother could even take a phone video of some of the story telling.
