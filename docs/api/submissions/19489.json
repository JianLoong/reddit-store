{"id": 19489, "submission_id": "146d142", "title": "WIBTA for refusing to let my sister ride with my brother and I on the way to vacation.", "selftext": "My parents just decided earlier this week on where we are going for vacation. Turns out were going to the mountains. While we have been here before, everyone is still really excited. The entire trip has been planned out so far. And we are all ready to go on vacation.Not only that but our grandparents are coming with us. So everyone is really excited for this trip. \n\nThough due to their age my grandparents don't want to dive 6+ hours to a mountain cabin, so their riding with us. With the addition of them, the total going in 7 people and its hard to find a vehicle that would fit us comfortably . So the solution is for someone to take another car, and I volunteered to take my truck along with my brother. While this fixed the crowding problem, it caused another to pop up.\n\nMy sister wants to ride with my brother and I. We have the room for her, and it would allow for the other car to have more room. But I don't want her to ride, for a number of reason. Mainly she is the worlds worst backseat driver.  No matter how well i drive somethings always wrong. I'm too close to one side, or I'm not checking blind-spots enough. Rather than calmly point out my mistake she screams at me that I cant drive and often demands i pull over and switch with her.\n\n Then there are a number of smaller reasons. She has to have complete control of music and ac, she has to be in the passenger seat, and  she is the only one who can choose rest-stops, restaurants, and gas station.Then the worst is she takes her damn shoes and sock off, then puts here nasty ass feet on the dash. When these things combine its honestly impossible to focus on the road as she gets load and mean when we don't listen to her. \n\nThe thing is she sees this as a sibling road-trip and away out of riding with all of the \"old people\". She has vowed to be calm and has agreed to stop backseat driving. But i don't trust her, and if I'm driving up a mountain in the dark I want more than a promise that nothing will happen. \n\n If i tell her no she will freakout before we leave. But i cant deal with her and navigate the interstate/mountain roads. So its essentially choosing between the lesser of two evils. A freak out at home before we leave  or on the middle of the interstate .  Id rather not have conflict at all but it unavoidable at this point, and i don't want to ruin vacation over the car arrangement.", "created_utc": 1686435961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146d142/wibta_for_refusing_to_let_my_sister_ride_with_my/", "score": 56, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly I think the backseat driver issue is reason enough. I'm assuming you will be traveling quite a distance on highways, and her screaming at you is just dangerous. I'd question whether this is something she's even able to \"turn off\". If her immediate reaction to some kind of driving scare is to scream, I doubt she will be able to control that. \n\nAlso side note, it's *incredibly* dangerous to put your feet up on the dash. If you crash, you're kind of fucked.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s tough. What did your brother say?\n\nshe is a grown adult, not a toddler. If she still throws a tantrum whenever she doesn\u2019t get her way then absolutely she is an asshole. If she has a meltdown, then SHE would be ruining the trip, not you.\n\nI would say don\u2019t let her ride with you and MAYBE  this will encourage an introspection and make her think about why her siblings refused to go on a roadtrip with her.", "NTA! Your vehicle, your rules. Someone would have ONE TIME to put their bare feet up on my dashboard before they received the permanent ban from my vehicle.", "NTA. Tell her no, and when she freaks out tell her that this is proof that she can\u2019t be calm and will ruin the trip. You do you.", "Just say no to her. Being afraid of her freakouts is no way to live. Decide what you think is right and if she has a tantrum just don\u2019t engage and walk away.", "NTA\n\nIf she is known to be like that, don't. You don't need someone screaming at you when you are navigating a somewhat complicated road. Also putting her feet on the dashboard is a stupid thing to do, can cause her more harm if an accident happens.", "NTA that kind passenger is just dangerous and her putting her feet on the dash is also super dangerous. Would it cramp you and your brother\u2019s trip if your grandparents road with you? If you do relent can it be on the condition that if she has to be in the back/ starts to back seat drive she has to move to the other vehicle?", "Offer to take your grandpa instead. Make it an opportunity to spend time with him. And offer to switch and have grandma ride with you on the way back. You get to play it off as awesome grandkid. Your sister is stuck in the other car. And you (hopefully, I don't know what your grandparents are like) get to have a chill ride there and back. Mix up the music on the radio, switch regularly from music they like to stuff you like (that won't drive the gparent nutty), and try and get stories about whichever parent of yours they raised, as future ammo!\n\nAnd I'm guessing your parents are encouraging your sister to ride with you because they know she sucks.", "Nta.\nI do not drive with one of my family members in the car for the same reason.  It stresses me out and makes me so nervous I can\u2019t focus on driving.  Safety first.", "How old is your sister that she can't even be respectful of the driver in HIS car? \n\nIf she behaves, she rides with. But the second she violates any behavior she promised to watch... she goes into the older generations' car. \n\nI just can't believe how entitled some folks are with other people's property or space...or driving habits.", "NTA.  I would just flat out say no if she asks again.  Tell her all the reasons why and if she flips out use that as proof that she can not remain calm and in control of herself and her emotions.  Having her in the truck with you seems like a liability and in fact dangerous to drive with.", "NTA, she sounds like a real pill.  Can she take her own car?", "NTA- I refuse to ride with my cousin because they drive with their volume up super high and worst it's all country music. Which is fine, but not really what I'd want to listen to in general on a road trip. Maybe the family can pool together money for a rental minivan? They do make ones that can fit 7 people, then it'd be less miles on your vehicles. Otherwise, stand your ground!!", "NTA, it doesn't sound safe to have her with you. Safety comes first", "Nobody puts their feet on my dash.", "Talk to your parent,  ask them if they\u2019ll ask her to drive them in their car. That way she\u2019s out of your hair & gets to control the driving, music & can\u2019t put her nasty feet on anyone\u2019s dash \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA, grow a backbone and tell her no. Someone is going to be put out either way, don\u2019t be a martyr, choose safety (and yourself)", "Tell her the list of things you've written here. Tell her these are not acceptable, and for you to even consider taking her, she will agree to not do any of those things. Ensure she agrees in front of your parents, and agrees she will ride with them if she breaks the rules. Then, the moment she breaks a rule, you contact the parents, find the closest rest stop, and she rides with them the rest of the way there. NTA", "WBTA. Have a grown adult talk with your sister about this rather than saying \u201ci don\u2019t trust her\u201d. Maybe you should work on that and learn to trust her.

Donr wanna deal with it on the road. And don't give in", "NTA the demand on your driving is a good enough reason. You need to be calmly focused on the road not your sister bitching from the back seat cause in no way should your brother sit in the back as he was the 1st passenger. Tell her it\u2019s brother bonding time and leave it at that. Not sibling bonding.", "Nta it sounds like she needs to be told no and that if she doesnt like the answer thats her problem", "NTA.  Tell her she hasn't proven herself and you don't believe she'll behave.  Then tell her you'll give her chances on a much smaller scale to prove herself in the future and maybe someday she'll be welcome, but for now it's a strong nope.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell her she will have to sit in the back, she can not chose the music, and the stops will be decided together.\n\nAnd if she refuses to get into the back, leave without her. She can take her own car then.", " I despise back seat drivers. \n\nIt\u2019s your truck. I would let sister know in no uncertain terms she is not riding with you and that\u2019s the final decision. \n\nDoes anyone want her to ride with them?\n\nShould you cave in, I would put a fly swatter in the map holder of the drivers side door. If/when she puts her feet on your dash, SMACK!!!", "NTA but it\u2019s fairly easy to make a rule that if she rides with you that she has certain conditions to meet.", "Put your foot down and tell her to keep her feet in her shoes.  Tell her your car, your rules.  Stop whenever you want tell her to shut her trap when she criticizes your driving and absolutely REFUSE to let her drive.  Play whatever music YOU want. You are NTA, but tell your sister ALL of this in advance and actually STICK to your guns.", "Dean Winchester once say those infamous words, Driver picks the music.", "NTA Stand strong and tell her no. Or you can tell your family you will load the luggage into your truck and make sure there is no room for her (bring a lot of extra bedding/pillows/towels).", "YTA\n\nShe's your girlfriend. You deal with her.  \n\nIf that's how she acts as a passenger, it isn't right to just dump that on the rest of your family while you ride off without her. It isn't as if she'll magically behave nicely if she's in the car with someone else.  \n\nAnd if the two of you are going to go forward with this relationship, you need to figure this out, because going into the future you'll be driving together a lot if you remain in a relationship.  Pushing the problem onto your parents and grandparents for one trip doesn't fix this.", "My brother doesn't know she want to ride with us yet. And I don't know if i should tell him cause he is much more confrontational and will actually confront her about all the stuff. \n\nAlso I doubt this one time will help", "shes 21", "Honestly I have tried to talk with her before but it never gets any where. It just goes in circles. I'll bring up that her screaming at me while I'm driving doesn't help and her only response will be \"Well drive better and I wont scream\".

Im not from Alabama", "Huh?", "Seems her behavior has happened too many times. Definitely don\u2019t let her bully you into giving in. Having her in the car with you is unsafe and you deserve to enjoy your trip, too.", "This is an easy decision. The fact you're making such heavy weather about it indicates she has you cowed. You can spend the rest of your life anxiously deferring to her, or you can start living life on your own terms.\n\nThe latter will require that you calmly hold the line until she realizes she can no longer bully you.\n\nUp to you.", "Write up a list of all things listed here and get her to sign saying she won\u2019t  do this. Also stimulate that she will not have ac or music control the e tire trip that is the drivers perk not hers.   The consequences of her actions will be either A. Waiting for the 2nd car to pick her up and take her and B. She will ride home with the old folks", "Uh, you should WANT a confrontation. Somebody needs to spell out the reasons that you don't want to ride with he. \n\nThe last time she did something obnoxious while driving with you is why you refuse to do this road trip with her. Perhaps if you hear that she was the perfect passenger in your parents' car, you'll think about letting her ride with you next time. \n\nNTA", "Tell him ASAP.", "Ugh...sorry you're dealing with her. \n\nIn retrospect I don't even think age should have been asked...it was an impulsive question...I don't think I'd excuse anyone of any age for her behaviors.", "If she still doesn\u2019t agree and gaslights you then you WNBTA for refusing to let her ride along. You gave her the chance to talk it out them.", "Hey, go easy on them. Their aunt mommy and uncle daddy didn't teach them reading comprehension."]}
