It can be hard having a family member with additional needs, and so completely understand you wanting your birthday to be about you (which is entirely reasonable). \n\nYour parents probably realise that this is a difficult thing to manage and want to do the right thing for everyone. Sit them down and lay out clearly what your concerns are, what\u2019s happened in the past and why you just want this time to be about you. \n\nI hope it goes ok and you have a good birthday when it comes!", "NTA for wanting your birthday to be anxiety free, your worries are valid. \n\nInfo: Is there another care taker that could look after her for the day?\n\nEdit: gramma", "NTA for wanting one day to be meltdown free. From what you wrote you don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re being mean to her- but you know her limits and what triggers her. \n\nIf your account of accurate, this sounds like a miserable trip. \n\nMaybe reach out to your grandparents and speak to you and your parents???", "NTA - meltdowns suck for everyone involved. If she's having frequent meltdowns on trips it doesn't sound like she'd be having fun either - they're usually physically and emotionally exhausting, and happen because of something upsetting (like sensory issues or routine changes). \n\nYou deserve to have your birthday be about you, without that being defined by your sisters needs. That's not mean, even kids with neurotypical siblings want and need one on one time with their parents. \n\nIt also sounds like your parents might be trying to include her in everything without considering whether it'll be good for her - if trips are this upsetting to her, they need to modify them or leave her with another caregiver. I work in inclusion and it's a common thing for parents to do - they want their child to feel included in what they see as important, without considering how that will affect siblings and whether the child wants to be included, routine is important to autistic people so many don't handle overnight trips well for example.", "thank you everyone for all the advice! <3", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can see why you don't want this at all.", "NTA your feelings are absolutely valid and totally understandable", "NTA. It doesn't sound like she's nonverbal, just selfish.\n\nAutism doesn't excuse anything (from experience)", "NTA about wanting to be the focus of your own birthday trip.\n\nClear and calm communication to your parents about wanting one-on-one time with them for your birthday trip might help you (instead of making your sister's behavior the reason as your parent may feel guilty about the relationship between you two and insist even more that she come along). And it's good that your grandparents are familiar caretakers and a possible available option.\n\nYTA for describing your autistic sister's meltdowns as mere tantrums. \n\nThe distinction between the two is that while tantrums usually end when someone gets what they want, meltdowns usually are a result of being overwhelmed without any immediate way of self soothing or calming down.", "A gentle YTA. meltdowns are not tantrums and the way you talk about her honestly makes me very uncomfortable.   \n 'i don't want her throwing a tantrum about not getting her way like she always does and making my special day about her.'   \n\n\nyou realize she can't control having a meltdown? it's not about her not getting her own way. it's about being sensory overloaded and there are ways to ensure she doesn't get overloaded. accommodations like headphones. you could have expressed your concern in a different way , more understanding. your young so that likely didn't enter your mind but it doesn't have to be all or nothing. have you tried asking your sister if she even wants to come? because if she doesn't maybe she could stay with someone else, like a grandparent.", "ESH. You need to educate yourself on autism because tantrums and meltdowns are not the same thing at all. Your sister has no control over her meltdowns and it\u2019s not her fault. But your parents should also let you be the centre of attention on your own birthday", "You're being an asshole a little bit.  But you're young and immaturity is gonna be built into your thoughts and perceptions.  You shouldn't have to shoulder the burden of an ill family member constantly, but as it stands, that's the way it is.  It's not totally fair for you, granted, but there are no other good options.    \nYou'll just have to grin and bear it and try to make a fun time of it for everyone else as they should make it fun for you.  Control what you can control and be optimistic about things working out well.", "NTA. I have a daughter who is autistic and I have to carefully manage situations so she doesn't have a melt down. What would happen if you discussed your fears with your sister? Would she be able to empathise with you and find a way to manage her issues? Would she be able to make the choice to stay with familiar people in her home environment? Maybe she would not want to go at all.", "NTA bc you're only 14. I got autism and it's definitely not fun when meltdowns happen for either party (normally when overwhelmed) but there are ways to navigate it. If it's noise, headphones (a common one I use to go to places like amusement parks where it's easy to get overwhelmed), crowding? Something to fidget with or take their mind off, maybe even one of those chewing necklaces? Since she's 18, she may be fine to walk out for a breath when she's getting overwhelmed or with a parent. Hope some of these might help if she does come along in the end?", "NTA at all for wanting a meltdown free birthday. I hope your mum and stepdad respect your wishes and that you have a great birthday!", "thank you for the advice!", "yes she can stay with our grandparents on our mums side, her father or her grandparents on her dads side", ">it's about being sensory overloaded and there are ways to ensure she doesn't get overloaded\n\nI feel if you are not from London, going to London is a surefire way to get sensory overloaded", "yeah, how op writes about meltdowns here truly gave a big ick.", "this isn\u2019t a young and immature take at all - having neurodivergent siblings is HARD. it\u2019s a constant battle and it\u2019s 100% understandable to not want your entire birthday plans ruined because of a sibling. It\u2019s a difficult situation but she\u2019s NTA for wanting her birthday to be about her", "It also sounds like, even though it's not \"fair,\" she wouldn't be happy going. Would it be worth destabilizing her whole routine for something she wouldn't even enjoy? \n\nMy advice would be, instead of framing it like \"it's MY birthday so I get to dictate,\" explain to your parents that you are also concerned for your sister (even if you're not really), and maybe suggest something closer to home that you could do with your sister that she would enjoy before the London trip. \n\nEnjoy your birthday!", "i have autism and i regularly go to london and yes it can be difficult at times - but there are ways to manage it. i wasn't trying to sound dismissive but it's really not black and white , i guess that's what i meant.", "It's immature to demand something so slight and selfish because you feel it's your privilege.  It's not going to be possible to make her birthday all about her.  That's the fact of the matter.  Being precious about it, hoping to be spoiled rotten while the family is facing really difficult matters is by all definitions immature.  \n\n\n\"I demand my birthday trip to be all about me\" is what a spoiled princess says.  Have you not seen Willy Wonka?     \n\n\nThe trip to London, the hotel stay, dinners out, shopping... ARE ALREADY ALL ABOUT HER for crying out loud.  Her sibling's behavior, which is uncontrollable and ever-present is also going to be a difficult part of this.  It's not fair, but that's the way it is.", "I agree with you here. Depending on the chaperone I guess, but I would say a 14 yo might not be equipped to navigate those challenges, especially based on what OP said.", "If there are other options for sister to be cared for, I don't think asking for one weekend is selfish or unfair. OP commented that there are several people that her sister can stay with.", "i definitely agree , but from what i could tell the parents were going too , so it would be the parents job to handle those challenges and help however they can , that being said i do kind of feel like the sister should also be asked what she thinks? if she thinks she can handle it etc because she might not even want to go in the first place"]}
