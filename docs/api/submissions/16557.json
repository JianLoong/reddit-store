A tantrum is what a toddler does, and equating her in her overwhelmed state to a toddler is incredibly ableist.

Does she actually want to go or is it just your parents who want her to? Taking her to a big city will most likely be very overwhelming for her and make a meltdown more likely\n\nSide note though, meltdowns are not the same thing as tantrums.

I went through similar things as you even though i was older. I wanted to go to a movie with friends and my parents would guilt me into bringing my brother. It broke me down because i was always happy to help my sibling and knew it was well intentioned, but it came at the expense of my own identity. I just wanted to watch a movie and not have to be responsible for exiting the theater to calm my brother down if the sensory was too much.\n\nHow far are you from London? If its overnight at all They may be concerned about care, or they may want her included for life experiences knowing she may have trouble in the future having them with friend groups.\n\nMy advice from my experiences:\n1/ know your parents may accidentally be putting you into a parental role. Its not malicious. Chances are having kids at all is new for them let along parenting a disabled adult.  It will be painful to set a boundary for you here but its ok to say \"i want to go to london just with you two. I will make time for my sister on <xyzabc>. Can she stay home?\" (This is assuming you are within reasonable travel to london and care is there for your sister if she needs it)\n2. Im not sure of your familys finances but maybe you can bring a friend and have your own room?  That way you still have alone time.\n3. You are 14 so you have many years to discover your identity. Your birthday weekend is not defined by your sister if she comes. If she doesnt come it doesnt mean you are a bad sister.

I understand your desire for a stress-free birthday, but I think you should bring your sister along to London. She doesn't have to be there for everything, but it seems like going to London is a bit of a big deal, and you're only gonna cause more problems if you exclude her. Not just meltdowns, but actual animosity, and between two sisters, that's just not something you wanna be the cause of.", "No.", "NTA.\n\nI am a disabled woman in my 20s and I understand where you\u2019re coming from.

You have a right to have a special day that is about you! Keep your head up!", "OP also try to put feelings behind your statements. \"When sister throws a tantrum I feel sad because all of your attention has to focus on her and that makes me feel like less of a priority. I also feel like I get less time with you to talk and joke around when this happens.\" Putting feelings behind your statement makes it less about her and more about you in a way that hopefully makes your parents understand your point of view. Try not to be accusatory about your sister and instead try to make them understand that you're feeling this way because you want time with them. There is nothing wrong with wanting a day for you. Can your sister stay with stepdad and maybe just go with your mom? \nNTA by the way \nHappy Birthday", "I'm autistic, too, and I'd have meltdowns just like OP's sister if you made me attend those planned activities (loud, new, crowded, busy? yikes!). Luckily, I'm an independent adult, I'm verbal, and I can advocate for myself so that no one could make me. I also wouldn't want my birthday plans ruined by someone else needing them cut short. The parents don't seem to care to meet either of their daughters' needs here.", "Being verbal doesn\u2019t mean someone\u2019s more cognitively able to control themselves in a crisis. Autism is a valid explanation for many behaviours and can be associated with a lower level of cognitive function, seeming like they are younger than they are and therefore not able to regulate their emotions as well as neurotypical people.", "... and the animosity that will grow for the sister whose birthday it ACTUALLY is???

Or would they just rage at you for being \"mean\" and \"selfish\" if you suggest that?", "Being autistic myself, let me explain to you this basic fact of life: \n\nAll of us, regardless of our deficiencies or struggles, are required to behave like adults, and to behave decently towards others. \n\nAutism, for the record, is not a cognitive defect -- autistic people are usually as smart (if not smarter) than the general population. It's an issue of executive function and social awareness. \n\nMuch like the lack of social awareness the sister exhibits, by throwing tantrums at her age, and demanding everything be about her.\n\nAll of this excepting the more extreme (eg. nonverbal) cases.", "It might work better if one parent can do the trip with you while the other maintains routing with the sister. Would something like that be an option that you might like?", "   Not just meltdowns, but actual animosity, and between two sisters, that's just not something you wanna be the cause of.", "For someone autistic you couldn\u2019t be more wrong. I work with autistic children. I\u2019m aware of what it is. I never said it was a cognitive defect. I said it can be associated with lower cognitive function which it can be. I work with many different children who seem much younger than they are and that\u2019s what I mean by that. Even if their academic standpoint isn\u2019t affected (not always), their emotional intelligence is. The fact you\u2019re using the word tantrum to describe it, that is often used to describe young children should be a sign. Again, being able to communicate verbally doesn\u2019t mean their autism isn\u2019t extreme enough to explain why they\u2019re unable to function. I work with around 100 kids. Of that, one is a selective mute and all have the ability to communicate verbally but pretty much all struggle with emotional regulation and a lot of them wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the situation described without sensory overload. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad or trying to be annoying or whatever.\n\nEdit: executive dysfunction is also an example of cognitive impairment caused by autism btw", "Yes, it's totally unreasonable for OP to want to have *one* day of the year revolve around what she wants, when the other 364 are all about managing sister's meltdowns.", "Ah, so you're a neurotypical person projecting your false understanding onto the situation.\n\nWe're not talking about children, here. We're talking about an adult.", "I work at a school with 7-21 year olds which includes this individual and if they\u2019re like the functioning of the kids I work with which it seems like, they likely have the mental age of a child, although technically a legal adult.

Again, you work with *children* and we're discussing *an adult*.\n\nI'm sorry, but you have a lower level of understanding than me. Stop talking.", "Really.  I'm pretty sure that's OP's everyday life, that sister's wants always always always matter more than hers.", "NTA at all, my (18F) brother (15M) also has severe autism and this post hit very close to home. I imagine you\u2019ve spent your whole life having to adapt plans, downplay ur needs etc to ensure your sister is comfortable and feeling safe. There\u2019s nothing at all wrong with wanting time with just your parents/parent-figures. Just a suggestion, what works for my family is planning 2 separate celebrations. So I will have my personal birthday celebration (eg. Going to London with just parents) but then also have another small birthday celebration with my brother (eg. Icecream at a place he knows well and is comfortable going to), so he feels included but in a way to avoid a meltdown and can be a nice experience for everyone. Also it\u2019s not fair for your parents to make your sister come to London if it\u2019s going to result in her being dysregulated and having constant meltdowns. I think a lot of people forget that meltdowns are extremely stressful and tiring for people with autism, your parents also need to consider your sisters wellbeing. Throughout my childhood many of my favourite memories were when I got to spend quality one-on-one time with my mum, something that was very rare due to my brothers extra needs. That being said as I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019ve started enjoying spending more time with my brother, but that is because I\u2019ve learnt to not force him out of his comfort zone, meltdowns are stressful for everyone and trying to play perfect/typical family does not work when one child has severe autism. I hope you have a lovely birthday, PM me if you ever want to talk, it\u2019s hard having a sibling with autism but you\u2019re not alone.", "If they're dead set on her coming perhaps talk about having plans for when she has meltdowns as well as the I told you so moments.

It is understandable that you want to celebrate your special occasion with something that\u2019s all about you and unfortunately, through she probably can\u2019t help it, that just isn\u2019t possible if your sister participates. I have a niece who\u2019s also 14 and whose little sister is also autistic. As much as she loves and cares about her, it does wear on her being a lower priority most of the time. I was glad to be able to take her out for a day that was all about her recently and you deserve the same.", "NTA, and if she\u2019s melting down that much chances are she\u2019s not even happy with going anyway. She\u2019d probably be happier staying home with the grandparents", "Nta at all, You have every right to not want YOUR birthday be about someone else.", "NTA this kind of reminds me of my 15th birthday which also involved a trip up to London, in my case to go to the British museum (one of my favourite places as a kid). I went with my mum, dad, sister, brother, and brother's girlfriend. My sister and brother's girlfriend spent the whole time bitching and sniping at each other and trying to involve me. When we got home and tried to play my new board game things got worse and brother's girlfriend stormed off crying. I felt so deflated and frustrated that they couldn't think about how I felt. The really frustrating thing about it is that they were both adults in their 20s who should have known better. I stopped spending my Birthdays with my family after that and have only had one with them in the last 13 years. *Anyway* obviously the situation is different but the point is your birthday should be about you and what you want", "NTA.", "NTA, and I hope you show your parents how many reddit posts involve the neglected sibling of a disabled person ceasing contact with their family after adulthood. \n\nYour parents are trying to force a situation that is unfair to you *and* to her. If she wants to go to London, they can take her on her own birthday, without you, and have full resources to dedicate to her needs. \n\nFor your birthday, though, it should be about you, and her mere presence as someone with a significant disability prevents that. For a while I had limited mobility, and I would have been damned before I let my parents ruin my little brother's birthday just so I could come along. \n\nEspecially knowing you're likely shunted aside for her needs regularly, you deserve this, and it is beyond okay to ask for it.\n\nETA: not sure what your sister's intellectual function/communicative abilities are, but please do be careful to keep your frustration-- the kind of feelings that led to the description of \"tantrum\" despite you demonstrating knowledge that a meltdown is different-- away from her ears. Perhaps your sister actually is weaponizing her diagnosis to get her way and act out without consequences, I don't know, but I couldn't tell from your post whether you actually think that or you're just frustrated by the fact that no amount of knowing the truth changes those feelings. Either way, probably best to keep those thoughts away from her.", "NTA and tbh if they insist then ask them to just cancel everything and let you go somewhere local with your friends like a nice restaurant on your birthday. Maybe even phrase it as it would be stressful for her, which is true, and that you really want some time with your parents where you are the focus even if that seems selfish. That you want to spend some time with just them. Also maybe volunteer to do something extra with your sister at home around that time so she feels special and you do a sisters bonding thing. It could be as simple as doing your nails together or a spa day (at home) to going to her favorite place or watching her favorite movie with her. Happy early birthday! I hope you get your trip.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are failing both you and your sister. They're forcing the both of you into unnecessary situations that will 1000% have conflict and harm the both of you.\n\nFrom what it sounds like, you've been neglected for and /or give into your parents wants and your sisters wants. AKA They're setting you on fire to keep themselves warm.\n\nIf this has 'always' been the norm, then they're choosing to abuse your sister. I'm saying abuse because it sounds like they're putting her into situations that are doomed to fail and are neglecting your sister's social, emotional, and mental development. Autism is a spectrum. It doesn't necessarily mean that your sister can't learn. And, if she can't learn, it's your parents duty to keep her in a safe environment.", "NTA. It\u2019s your day not theirs", "Where is she supposed to go if your parents are with you? Did you really think this through?", "NTA. My sister has an autistic son(17) and a daughter (almost 19). He is nonverbal and a lot of work. Of course we all love him very much. But my sister makes sure she does stuff alone with her daughter. She does other things along with him as well. But she knows where she can bring him and where she can't. I hope you have a wonderful trip and happy birthday!", "You're 14 and a minor. You have to listen to what your parents say or else come to a compromise and have a talk with them and give them your reasons. What you are doing is simply throwing a teenage tantrum. It is not only about you. Its about family. Sure your sister might have issues but you're behaving just like your sister now. I live with an autistic sibling too and we try to include her in everything we do. Dont think Reddit has any clout over your parents' decisions.", "Yes, avoid saying, \"I don't want her to come.\"  That makes them defensive, so they'll dig their heels in and stop listening.\n\nRather use phrases, \"Here are my concerns about her coming on the trip: example, example , example...\n\n \"I don't think sister will enjoy that kind of trip because she's easily overstimulated and will get stressed out by the crowds etc.  It won't be fun for her.\"", "Dude, this comment is totally uncalled for. Not everyone likes their siblings, nor are they obliged to put up with their shitty behavior, especially on their birthday.\n\nAlso, she doesn't have to go. Her parents have as much power as she allows them to have. What are they going to do, tie her up and force her on the train?", "Hey, also on Spectrum. I completely agree with you. Weapoizing ANY trait a person has is a bullshit move. But I feel a special indignation towards people on the spectrum who do that type of shit with their meltdowns. It infantilizes all of us and leans heavily into already ableist lines of thinking.\n \nThe question is, which one is her sister? There is definitely not enough information for me to tell.", "NTA but with a huge huge caveat.\n\nYou are perfectly within reason to not want someone to come along if you don't want them. I may have mixed feelings about that right now, but it IS true. I don't blame you for wanting a friction-free good time.\n\nNot a big fan of how you are talking about your sister, though. Sounds like shit is REAL hard for her on a daily basis, and that kind of thing? Meltdowns and such? Not about selfishness. At all. It's extremely miserable for her. It seems like it would be a KINDNESS not to have her along. Just, you know, not primarily a kindness to you.", "NTA   \nyou are justified in wanting your birthday to be spent without the stress...\n\nBut  you do come across as self-centred, and yes, it is mean to leave her out. How would you feel being left out of a family trip because no one wanted to hear you complain about your sister's \"tantrums\"?  You say you have relatives who could take her, but did you actually ask them? Because let me tell you, it is not easy to find someone to care for an autistic teenager overnight. My non-verbal autistic sister was dropped on my doorstep 3 years ago and do you know how many people stepped up to offer help? I had to drive 4 hours to get someone to watch her for 2 hours so I could take my own kids somewhere fun that I didn't think she could handle. HER OWN FATHER offered no help from the start, and even told the social workers to stop calling him to update him on what was going on with her when my mom died. But then, we're different people, with different lives. When I was 14 I stayed up all night repeatedly pushing the button on my sister's carebear because that was the only way she could sleep and my mom not being psycho in the morning was more important to me than school. You complain about \"tantrums\".  \n\nI understand this will be downvoted to oblivion, but it hurt me to read. I understand how more people will relate to OP in this, but it's clear to me that OP hasn't spent much time with her sister and just resents her for needing attention.", "NTA and she's doesn't have to go. It is important for you to have times to shine, without your sister. One parent can stay behind or she can stay with relatives. It is wrong to never let you experience milestones as an individual.", "NAH\n\nI know what it's like to just want birthdays to just be about the birthday person, in this case, you and how hard it can be to want the day to be nice but, also your parents not wanting someone, in this case, your sister to feel left out.", "NTA- I'm not autistic and London makes me want to have a total meltdown. Especially the public transport. It would be literal torture for your sister. Tell them you get that she has extra needs, but you have needs too, and if you could just once have a day when you're able to enjoy yourself without worrying about her, it would mean the world to you.", "NTA\n\nI'd say something like, Look, we all know that she'll be unhappy traveling and you'll be trying to make her feel better and frankly...I'd like a day where your attention is going to be on me.  I love her too, but it's not fair that there can't be a time where I have you to myself without worrying about her outbursts.  \n\nIt bothers me to be told I'm mean.  I'm not, but I have emotional needs that you're overlooking because I don't have the same issues as sister.  It feels like you're putting her above me in all things and ignoring me because you don't have the energy after dealing with her.\n\nI'd suggest having them look up \"[Glass Child Syndrome](https://www.wikihow.com/What-Is-the-Meaning-of-Glass-Child)\"...", "NTA you deserve to have your day and she should stay home, i\u2019m sorry it doesn\u2019t seem to be going that way, you should have a stress free birthday", "I have an autistic sister and it's the fucking worst inviting her to shit. Ugh. She doesn't want to leave the house anyways.", "I think there are two issues here: \n\n1) OP's right to have a happy birthday.\n\n2) Sister's right not to be dragged into a trip where she will be constantly overstimulated and unhappy.\n\nHas anyone *asked* sister if she wants to go, and described to her what will happen on the trip?\n\nI feel that the parents are being selfish (wanting to look like good parents to a ND kid) without looking at both girls' needs.", "I don't think you're the asshole, but as someone who is autistic and unfortunately prone to meltdowns - often more than not we can't really control when these happen. It may be too stimulating for us at this time or that we cannot simply control our emotions at this time.  \n\n\nI am not prone to them OFTEN, and they rather come when I'm in solitude. As for airplanes, I feel like this may be a BIG change to your big sister, and if she isn't competent enough to make her own choices and decisions, then this falls onto the parents. \n\nNTA, but consider that your sister may not be able to control herself due to her condition.", "I haven't experienced it myself, so take a grain of salt here, but I've read several articles about the emotional damage that is done to the sibling of a child with special needs (mental, physical, whatever) because they end up never being a priority in their family. It is essentially the same result as growing up with a Golden Child, but they have to deal with an added side of guilt for resenting something out of everyone's control. \n\nYes, the sister may not be able to control her meltdowns (not enough info to know if it's something that can be controlled) but that doesn't mean that they won't turn what should be a positive birthday to into something that is stressful and unpleasant for everyone.\n\nOP should occasionally get a day that is about her, and if the only way to do that is to leave sis at home, then I think it's a fair ask.\n\nEdit: NTA", "OP mentioned both sets of grandparents and, I believe, an aunt that could help.\n\nETA: corrected typo", "Talk directly to your grandparents. They know your sister, and I am sure they can help your parents see that the London trip wouldn't be enjoyable for your sister and would mean a lot to you.", "Bro shut the fuck up. OP disregard this troll\n\nThere has been some genuinely great advice on this thread. You deserve to have a day for you, the way you want it, and it sounds like the experience would be distressing for your sister anyway. You may be young but you are in an important stage of developing boundaries and autonomy! This is a good thing! Your parents are there to guide you and provide a safe existence, but they are not the be-all end-all authority over your life. You deserve to be heard and make your own choices\n\nEdit to say I\u2019m autistic and while being included in SOME social outings is really important and nice, if whatever is going on pushes me to having meltdowns I obviously am not enjoying it in the slightest. Also NTA", "Dude, GTFOH with that load of bs. OP has every right to spend her birthday as she sees fit, as do all of us. My sisters were part of my birthday party the family would have for me growing up, but my actual birthday *celebration* was about the things I wanted to do with the people I wanted to do them with - that meant no siblings. \n\nAs a mother now, my children are not required to invite their siblings to their celebration. If they want to - cool, if not - also cool, if the sibling wishes to decline - still cool. They are all a part of the birthday party we have as a family. \n\nOP is not throwing a tantrum, and HER birthday isn\u2019t about family it\u2019s about HER.", "thats correct i have 2 sets of grand parents, her father and our aunt and uncle", "It's literally her birthday, the one day in the year when it should be about her, not her sister. Seriously. Not that much to ask."]}
