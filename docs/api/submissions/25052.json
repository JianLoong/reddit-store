{"id": 25052, "submission_id": "15vwnkc", "title": "AITA for telling my husband if he wants someone to stay home with our baby, he can do it?", "selftext": "For context, I\u2019m currently 29 weeks pregnant. My husband (29M) and I (30F) met in college, and have been together for 8 years, married for 2. Our relationship has always been solid, and progressive. My husband has never been much of a traditionalist despite growing up in a very stereotypical family (had 2 siblings and a stay at home mom, his dad worked). Up until recently, we\u2019ve agreed on nearly everything (save for small things) in our marriage and how to raise kids. However, 2 days ago, we were talking about baby stuff, and my husband started mentioning that he thought maybe one of us she stay home with the baby for awhile, and not go back to work after our maternity/paternity leave is over. We both work in tech, and make good money and have great benefits. I get 20 weeks of leave after the baby is born, he gets 12. We were trying to decide if we should stagger our leave so someone could be home with the baby until 6 months, the age where most places near us will start daycare. My husband said that he read that it\u2019s better for the baby to have a parent home for the first year. So I asked him (thinking nothing of it) if that\u2019s really something he\u2019d consider, since he might have to quit his job. He asked why he would have to quit, since I should \u201cobviously\u201d be the one to stay home with the baby. I asked him if he was serious and he said yes, the mom should be the one to stay home. I said how are we going to make that work on just his income? For context, I make about 3 times what my husband does. It\u2019s never been an issue and never mattered to me, I just finished my masters earlier than he did (we both have them) and went into a more specialized field. We both make good money, but it\u2019s my job primarily that pays for the lifestyle we have. So I asked him what we were going to do for a year on 1/4 the income with a new baby. He got a little upset and said I \u201cshouldn\u2019t even bring that up\u201d and that he makes good enough money to provide for us and I shouldn\u2019t \u201cquestion him\u201d. I got mad, and said it wasn\u2019t realistic and it was silly for the person who made more money to quit their job, especially since he\u2019s the one who thinks someone should be with the baby extra time (I was fine with sending baby to daycare starting at 6 months). The fight blew up from there, me saying he\u2019s being sexist and not considering my feelings at all. I refused to back down  and he ended up taking off after I said he should be the stay at home parent if he wants one so bad, and him saying he didn\u2019t deserve to be emasculated just for suggesting I should stay home like a \u201cgood mom\u201d. I talked to some of my family and his family about it and the answers are kind of split, so AITA for bringing up the pay disparity and telling him that unless he\u2019s the one to stay home, baby is going to daycare?", "created_utc": 1692491866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vwnkc/aita_for_telling_my_husband_if_he_wants_someone/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is being sexist thinking that since you\u2019re a woman your place is in the home. He\u2019s also sexist because he thinks the suggestion that he stays home is emasculating. If he is so progressive that word would not have been uttered,He needs to wake up and smell the coffee.   \n\n\nStand your ground. He can\u2019t make you quit your job. So sign up for those waitlists and good luck. Would he go to counseling? If not, go yourself. I\u2019m concerned this is just the tip of the iceberg of his real feelings and you need to be prepared.", "NTA. I'll be sure to let my husband know I \"emasculated\" him when he was a SAHD for two years. Plus, your husband basically told you you're a bad mom if you don't stay home. I'd be pissed at having my parenting called in question based solely on if I stayed home.\n\nMarriage counseling, STAT.", "NTA.  Your logic is spot on.  He\u2019s taking the archaic, sexist, illogical, ego-driven path. \n\nTry living as if he\u2019s the only working partner for a few months.  Live off of only his income to show him what type of life that would afford you.  It\u2019ll be a wake up call for him, and you\u2019ll have some additional savings at the end.  \n\nI\u2019m a little worried this is the first instance of a mask dropping, and that you\u2019ll encounter more such sexist or controlling bullshit in the future.", "NTA. I hope this is a blip and him not just starting to show his true colors. He\u2019s the one who thinks the baby needs a stay at home parent, and he\u2019s also the one who makes less. So he\u2019s welcome to stay home, or keep working and baby will go to daycare. But you quitting your job is not on the table and he has no right to expect it to be.", "Well done! You've used logic and sound reasoning to explain why he should be the one to stay home with the baby for the six months to the child's first natal day. \n\nIt is not your fault his ego can't stand up to logic. His emasculation is a result of this, not a thing of your doing. \n\nHe fell back on the training he's had from childhood: women are the homemakers, the stay-at-homes, and the menfolk should hunt. \n\nIt's just tragic IMO that you're the better hunter so far. :D\n\nNTA.", "This is bizarre. \n\nIt seems like he is secretly very sexist. Did he never show any signs of this over 8 years? It\u2019s genuinely cruel of him to imply that you are not a good mother. It\u2019s also really gross to say that any mention of his salary as it pertains to paying your bills and maintaining your lifestyle for yourselves and your child is tantamount to \u201cemasculating\u201d him. Just the idea of taking care of his own child and relying on his spouse\u2019s higher salary is somehow emasculating? It\u2019s all so disturbing and gross.", "NTA at all. It makes sense to me 1. To have the person who makes more working and 2. For the person pushing for it to do it if they are adament that one parent stays home and one works and the other doesnt want to stay home", "NTA\n\nHis attitude is obviously sexist and wrong. It may be coming from a place of anxiety. You're getting closer to baby being here and he may be thinking he doesn't want baby in daycare so soon, but also realizing he doesn't want to stay home with baby and quit his job, so he's trying to pressure you into doing it. But he can't have it both ways. Plenty of dads are SAHPs. This isn't the 1850s. Putting baby in daycare is a perfectly acceptable solution. If he really wants someone to stay home with baby for the first year, he can quit his job, but he should understand that he may struggle to get rehired in the current job market and these feelings of emasculation may only be compounded, something SAHMs encounter all the time when they try to reenter the workforce after raising children. So since he's balking in the first place, I would probably suggest pushing the daycare option at 6 months.", "NTA. He may have tried to give up his patriarchal ideals, but he clearly hasn't been that successful. However, he's the one who wants a stay at home parent, so he's clearly the pne that should do it.", "NTA but it might be that a discussion about finances with actual budget and expense numbers might resonate. He seems to have his ego wrapped up in being able to provide for his family and showing where the numbers don't match might help take some of the emotion out of it.", "Ew ew ew, NTA. He's not progressive, he's one of those fake progressives who only say things to make themselves look good. No progressive guy would feel emasculated by either the prospect of being a stay at home parent or by the fact that he makes a quarter of what you do. He's always been regressive and he's just now showing you that side of himself. \n\nFrankly, I think maybe a part of this is that he resents you for making more too. Not sure where you go from here, but in a calm moment tell him he has two choices-baby in daycare after 6 months or he stays at home. And dollars to donuts he's gonna do a crap job on his 12 weeks of leave.", "NTA. If it's that big of a deal for him he can (a) stay home, (b) you guys can cut costs elsewhere and get a nanny, or (c) a combination of a and b.", "NTA. I think deep down, he feels insecure that you make more than he does. So by pressuring you to quit your job and stay home with the baby, he will become the breadwinner and it will boost his ego. Do not quit your job and put your family in a worse financial situation just because your husband is jealous of you and insecure.", "NTA. It makes sense for the person who makes less to stay home if someone is going to do it.", "Nta had a friend couple have mom stay home cause she was 'obviously' who should stay home.  She was an engineer and he was a social worker.  She made, at least, twice his salary.  Guess who continues to have money troubles 16 YEARS later?\n\nMy dad stayed home bc he made less and had shittier insurance.  Whoever makes less is the obvious choice", "NTA - this is just a situation where you both have different opinions going into it, but you both need to be willing to negotiate and think things through and be flexible about your options.\n\nIn this instance there are several options you may not have considered.\n\n- it might be possible for you both to work part time so you can split the care between you and each have some independence and some downtime\n\n- you may feel differently when the child arrives to how you feel now, especially if it\u2019s your first baby. It would be better to defer the decision until you see how the birth goes and what the new dynamics are when you become a family of three. He may well find that he is besotted and doesn\u2019t want to go back to work - and you might find the same. It\u2019s very hard to make that decision based on a hypothetical, not-yet-present situation. Babies change their parents.\n\n- the benefits of one-on-one care can be provided by a nanny or au pair rather than putting your child into a daycare or nursery environment; so you might be able to both work and still provide that for your child if you are comfortably circumstanced\n\nBut aside from all that, you\u2019re right that he\u2019s being sexist if he feels emasculated by the idea of being a primary career for his own child. That attitude is at least half a century out of date and he needs to adjust his ideas and consider the impact of what he\u2019s saying - especially if you\u2019re expecting a daughter or hope to have one in future.\n\nAs far as the money goes, he\u2019s probably right that you\u2019d be able to make it work if you took the hit to your income in the short term; but he clearly has some issues with his self esteem being tied to his income and with valuing domestic labour accurately - so this is probably something it would be a good idea for you both to discuss with both a family counsellor and a financial advisor in terms of how you can manage your incomes, expectations and communication around these things.\n\nOnce the baby arrives you will find it much harder to find the mental space and the time to have rational discussions about this, and any benefit to staying at home with your baby for the extra six months would be undone by having this level of conflict in the home, so you need to address this sooner rather than later to check you\u2019ve considered *all* your options and to get yourselves on the same page over how you will make the decisions and handle difficult discussions within your parenting journey.", "NTA. At all. You should be able to have these conversations with your spouse. But, the bigger problem here is I think your husband has been hiding from you who he really is...and his beliefs are much more \"traditional\" than he wanted you to believe until it was too late.\n\nThe \"like a good mom\" thing would completely turn me off. I would truly struggle to reconcile after that.", "NTA The misogyny was just exposed, and he doesn't appreciate it.\n\nLet him calm down and have a calm conversation about this\n\n1 he is changing the goal posts by 6 months with no guarantee that either job can sustain the career break \n\n2. He has slipped into traditional roles when you are normally both progressive. What prompted this? Is someone in his ear saying you should be staying home?\n\n3. Will 1 year become 2,3,4?\n\n4. What will the impact of losing either wage have on your lifestyle? Kids are expensive. This is something that needs clear consideration.\n\n5. Could you both go back to 4 day weeks with only 3 days in daycare?\n\n6. Can parents help?\n\nNo matter what, take the time to work out why he is reacring this way. Some men feel stressed about the risk to your health and welfare of childbirth and the responsibility of becoming a dad. Also, you have no idea how you will feel once the baby is here.

Unless he specifically brought up nursing (which might possibly, maybe, be a reason for the mom to stay home... but you wouldn't know how that goes until after the baby arrives anyway, because sometimes it just... doesn't go as planned), there's no reason it has to be the mom, is better if it's the mom, or SHOULD be the mom.", "I have a feeling that his very traditional family and probably friends have been asking him about the baby and postpartum plans. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t have the spine to admit that it makes sense for him to be the one to stay home because he knows how they feel about non traditional family care. \n\nSo because he\u2019s unable to stand up for himself in the moment, he\u2019s now decided that he\u2019s the victim in all of this and you just need to comply to help him save face. \n\nBut the fact is\u2026you make more money than him and probably always will.

That's actually two different things.\n\nBecause her husband alleged he can provide for the family as a *rebuttal* to the OP's concern, and the OP doesn't deny it, I consider it true, and thus the total household income is a luxury. It's optional. Especially with only a year, maybe two, of a decrease.\n\nTherefore, this conflict isn't about money at all. It is purely about the competition in social needs between the OP, her husband, and the child. And there is no tiebreaker--the OP flubbed her attempt to use the comparative income as one.", "So, instead let's burden the partner who is thinking clearly with both the logical burden and ALL of the emotional load that comes with attempting to solve the issue, all without bruising her partner's fragile ego any further... \n\nNo, the guy needs to step up and apply his training, not run off when he doesn't get his way. Oh, wait: that's just more work for the partner, settling him down so he can apply his own well-developed anaytical skills.\n\nLong-term, this pattern (if established) reeks of futility for OP's future. Any dispute that he doesn't \"win\" that has a gender bias, she ends doing all of the work for settling the dispute, and has to cater to his ego.", "...you...you do know that pumping is a thing, right? Working moms breast feed all the time. This is not a real issue.\n\nAnd no, there isn't anything wrong with a woman choosing to stay home. But to say a woman should stay home because she, what, has boobs? That's misogynistic in the extreme.", "There\u2019s absolutely something wrong with trying to force or manipulate your partner into taking on a role they don\u2019t want."]}
