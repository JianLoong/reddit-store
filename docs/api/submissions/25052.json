{"id": 25052, "submission_id": "15vwnkc", "title": "AITA for telling my husband if he wants someone to stay home with our baby, he can do it?", "selftext": "For context, I\u2019m currently 29 weeks pregnant. My husband (29M) and I (30F) met in college, and have been together for 8 years, married for 2. Our relationship has always been solid, and progressive. My husband has never been much of a traditionalist despite growing up in a very stereotypical family (had 2 siblings and a stay at home mom, his dad worked). Up until recently, we\u2019ve agreed on nearly everything (save for small things) in our marriage and how to raise kids. However, 2 days ago, we were talking about baby stuff, and my husband started mentioning that he thought maybe one of us she stay home with the baby for awhile, and not go back to work after our maternity/paternity leave is over. We both work in tech, and make good money and have great benefits. I get 20 weeks of leave after the baby is born, he gets 12. We were trying to decide if we should stagger our leave so someone could be home with the baby until 6 months, the age where most places near us will start daycare. My husband said that he read that it\u2019s better for the baby to have a parent home for the first year. So I asked him (thinking nothing of it) if that\u2019s really something he\u2019d consider, since he might have to quit his job. He asked why he would have to quit, since I should \u201cobviously\u201d be the one to stay home with the baby. I asked him if he was serious and he said yes, the mom should be the one to stay home. I said how are we going to make that work on just his income? For context, I make about 3 times what my husband does. It\u2019s never been an issue and never mattered to me, I just finished my masters earlier than he did (we both have them) and went into a more specialized field. We both make good money, but it\u2019s my job primarily that pays for the lifestyle we have. So I asked him what we were going to do for a year on 1/4 the income with a new baby. He got a little upset and said I \u201cshouldn\u2019t even bring that up\u201d and that he makes good enough money to provide for us and I shouldn\u2019t \u201cquestion him\u201d. I got mad, and said it wasn\u2019t realistic and it was silly for the person who made more money to quit their job, especially since he\u2019s the one who thinks someone should be with the baby extra time (I was fine with sending baby to daycare starting at 6 months). The fight blew up from there, me saying he\u2019s being sexist and not considering my feelings at all. I refused to back down  and he ended up taking off after I said he should be the stay at home parent if he wants one so bad, and him saying he didn\u2019t deserve to be emasculated just for suggesting I should stay home like a \u201cgood mom\u201d. I talked to some of my family and his family about it and the answers are kind of split, so AITA for bringing up the pay disparity and telling him that unless he\u2019s the one to stay home, baby is going to daycare?\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: \nI was reading through a ton of comments last night and got really nervous, wondering if maybe I was wrong about my husband being progressive- a lot of people were asking why we didn\u2019t talk about all this before we got pregnant and the thing is, we did! We had agreed on daycare (for the people suggesting a nanny, I\u2019ve begun looking into it but they are a really difficult to find sometimes) because we both wanted to keep our jobs that we love. \n\nMy husband has been acting weird and quiet since we fought but this morning I finally sat him down and was basically like \u201cwhat is going on, this doesn\u2019t seem like you\u201d. Some of the comments here got me thinking about what his family might be pressuring him to do, and so I asked about that and a ton of stuff came out. \n\nHe said he brought up the staggered leave to some people in his family at dinner a couple weeks ago (I wasn\u2019t there) and a few of them thought someone should stay home longer, and his brother laughed and made some jokes about my husband being a housewife/ stay at home mom. His brother (35, divorced!) considers himself to be a \u201cman\u2019s man\u201d and has a lot of sexist views, so he\u2019s made jokes before about me being the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d. \nSo after hearing this my husband snapped a bit because some of his coworkers and his older brother have laid into him a bit about the fact that I make more money and have a better job title, calling him a \u201ctrophy husband\u201d and other dumb stuff like that, and it made my husband feel insecure so he lashed out a bit at me and that\u2019s why we fought. He\u2019s admitted that he felt really bad about it which is why he\u2019s kind of been avoiding me. \n\nWe have now agreed to looking into a counselor and more into a nanny service, and he has admitted that he doesn\u2019t mind the idea of taking a few unpaid months to stay home, he\u2019s just really worried about his brother and friends jokes. \nThank you to everyone for helping me feel more confident to confront this, we are doing much better.", "created_utc": 1692491866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vwnkc/aita_for_telling_my_husband_if_he_wants_someone/", "score": 11638, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is being sexist thinking that since you\u2019re a woman your place is in the home. He\u2019s also sexist because he thinks the suggestion that he stays home is emasculating. If he is so progressive that word would not have been uttered,He needs to wake up and smell the coffee.   \n\n\nStand your ground. He can\u2019t make you quit your job. So sign up for those waitlists and good luck. Would he go to counseling? If not, go yourself. I\u2019m concerned this is just the tip of the iceberg of his real feelings and you need to be prepared.", "NTA. I'll be sure to let my husband know I \"emasculated\" him when he was a SAHD for two years. Plus, your husband basically told you you're a bad mom if you don't stay home. I'd be pissed at having my parenting called in question based solely on if I stayed home.\n\nMarriage counseling, STAT.", "NTA.  Your logic is spot on.  He\u2019s taking the archaic, sexist, illogical, ego-driven path. \n\nTry living as if he\u2019s the only working partner for a few months.  Live off of only his income to show him what type of life that would afford you.  It\u2019ll be a wake up call for him, and you\u2019ll have some additional savings at the end.  \n\nI\u2019m a little worried this is the first instance of a mask dropping, and that you\u2019ll encounter more such sexist or controlling bullshit in the future.", "NTA. I hope this is a blip and him not just starting to show his true colors. He\u2019s the one who thinks the baby needs a stay at home parent, and he\u2019s also the one who makes less. So he\u2019s welcome to stay home, or keep working and baby will go to daycare. But you quitting your job is not on the table and he has no right to expect it to be.", "Well done! You've used logic and sound reasoning to explain why he should be the one to stay home with the baby for the six months to the child's first natal day. \n\nIt is not your fault his ego can't stand up to logic. His emasculation is a result of this, not a thing of your doing. \n\nHe fell back on the training he's had from childhood: women are the homemakers, the stay-at-homes, and the menfolk should hunt. \n\nIt's just tragic IMO that you're the better hunter so far. :D\n\nNTA.", "This is bizarre. \n\nIt seems like he is secretly very sexist. Did he never show any signs of this over 8 years? It\u2019s genuinely cruel of him to imply that you are not a good mother. It\u2019s also really gross to say that any mention of his salary as it pertains to paying your bills and maintaining your lifestyle for yourselves and your child is tantamount to \u201cemasculating\u201d him. Just the idea of taking care of his own child and relying on his spouse\u2019s higher salary is somehow emasculating? It\u2019s all so disturbing and gross.", "NTA at all. It makes sense to me 1. To have the person who makes more working and 2. For the person pushing for it to do it if they are adament that one parent stays home and one works and the other doesnt want to stay home", "NTA\n\nHis attitude is obviously sexist and wrong. It may be coming from a place of anxiety. You're getting closer to baby being here and he may be thinking he doesn't want baby in daycare so soon, but also realizing he doesn't want to stay home with baby and quit his job, so he's trying to pressure you into doing it. But he can't have it both ways. Plenty of dads are SAHPs. This isn't the 1850s. Putting baby in daycare is a perfectly acceptable solution. If he really wants someone to stay home with baby for the first year, he can quit his job, but he should understand that he may struggle to get rehired in the current job market and these feelings of emasculation may only be compounded, something SAHMs encounter all the time when they try to reenter the workforce after raising children. So since he's balking in the first place, I would probably suggest pushing the daycare option at 6 months.", "NTA. He may have tried to give up his patriarchal ideals, but he clearly hasn't been that successful. However, he's the one who wants a stay at home parent, so he's clearly the pne that should do it.", "NTA but it might be that a discussion about finances with actual budget and expense numbers might resonate. He seems to have his ego wrapped up in being able to provide for his family and showing where the numbers don't match might help take some of the emotion out of it.", "Ew ew ew, NTA. He's not progressive, he's one of those fake progressives who only say things to make themselves look good. No progressive guy would feel emasculated by either the prospect of being a stay at home parent or by the fact that he makes a quarter of what you do. He's always been regressive and he's just now showing you that side of himself. \n\nFrankly, I think maybe a part of this is that he resents you for making more too. Not sure where you go from here, but in a calm moment tell him he has two choices-baby in daycare after 6 months or he stays at home. And dollars to donuts he's gonna do a crap job on his 12 weeks of leave.", "NTA. If it's that big of a deal for him he can (a) stay home, (b) you guys can cut costs elsewhere and get a nanny, or (c) a combination of a and b.", "NTA. I think deep down, he feels insecure that you make more than he does. So by pressuring you to quit your job and stay home with the baby, he will become the breadwinner and it will boost his ego. Do not quit your job and put your family in a worse financial situation just because your husband is jealous of you and insecure.", "NTA. It makes sense for the person who makes less to stay home if someone is going to do it.", "Nta had a friend couple have mom stay home cause she was 'obviously' who should stay home.  She was an engineer and he was a social worker.  She made, at least, twice his salary.  Guess who continues to have money troubles 16 YEARS later?\n\nMy dad stayed home bc he made less and had shittier insurance.  Whoever makes less is the obvious choice", "NTA - this is just a situation where you both have different opinions going into it, but you both need to be willing to negotiate and think things through and be flexible about your options.\n\nIn this instance there are several options you may not have considered.\n\n- it might be possible for you both to work part time so you can split the care between you and each have some independence and some downtime\n\n- you may feel differently when the child arrives to how you feel now, especially if it\u2019s your first baby. It would be better to defer the decision until you see how the birth goes and what the new dynamics are when you become a family of three. He may well find that he is besotted and doesn\u2019t want to go back to work - and you might find the same. It\u2019s very hard to make that decision based on a hypothetical, not-yet-present situation. Babies change their parents.\n\n- the benefits of one-on-one care can be provided by a nanny or au pair rather than putting your child into a daycare or nursery environment; so you might be able to both work and still provide that for your child if you are comfortably circumstanced\n\nBut aside from all that, you\u2019re right that he\u2019s being sexist if he feels emasculated by the idea of being a primary career for his own child. That attitude is at least half a century out of date and he needs to adjust his ideas and consider the impact of what he\u2019s saying - especially if you\u2019re expecting a daughter or hope to have one in future.\n\nAs far as the money goes, he\u2019s probably right that you\u2019d be able to make it work if you took the hit to your income in the short term; but he clearly has some issues with his self esteem being tied to his income and with valuing domestic labour accurately - so this is probably something it would be a good idea for you both to discuss with both a family counsellor and a financial advisor in terms of how you can manage your incomes, expectations and communication around these things.\n\nOnce the baby arrives you will find it much harder to find the mental space and the time to have rational discussions about this, and any benefit to staying at home with your baby for the extra six months would be undone by having this level of conflict in the home, so you need to address this sooner rather than later to check you\u2019ve considered *all* your options and to get yourselves on the same page over how you will make the decisions and handle difficult discussions within your parenting journey.", "NTA. At all. You should be able to have these conversations with your spouse. But, the bigger problem here is I think your husband has been hiding from you who he really is...and his beliefs are much more \"traditional\" than he wanted you to believe until it was too late.\n\nThe \"like a good mom\" thing would completely turn me off. I would truly struggle to reconcile after that.", "NTA The misogyny was just exposed, and he doesn't appreciate it.\n\nLet him calm down and have a calm conversation about this\n\n1 he is changing the goal posts by 6 months with no guarantee that either job can sustain the career break \n\n2. He has slipped into traditional roles when you are normally both progressive. What prompted this? Is someone in his ear saying you should be staying home?\n\n3. Will 1 year become 2,3,4?\n\n4. What will the impact of losing either wage have on your lifestyle? Kids are expensive. This is something that needs clear consideration.\n\n5. Could you both go back to 4 day weeks with only 3 days in daycare?\n\n6. Can parents help?\n\nNo matter what, take the time to work out why he is reacring this way.

Unless he specifically brought up nursing (which might possibly, maybe, be a reason for the mom to stay home... but you wouldn't know how that goes until after the baby arrives anyway, because sometimes it just... doesn't go as planned), there's no reason it has to be the mom, is better if it's the mom, or SHOULD be the mom.", "I have a feeling that his very traditional family and probably friends have been asking him about the baby and postpartum plans. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t have the spine to admit that it makes sense for him to be the one to stay home because he knows how they feel about non traditional family care. \n\nSo because he\u2019s unable to stand up for himself in the moment, he\u2019s now decided that he\u2019s the victim in all of this and you just need to comply to help him save face. \n\nBut the fact is\u2026you make more money than him and probably always will.

Most of the replies here are coming from people who obviously don\u2019t realise this.\n\nLochia, postpartum bleeding, lasts for around 4-8 weeks. Every woman experiences this after having a baby.\n\nIn some cases, lochia can last for up to 12 weeks. That\u2019s up to *3 months* of essentially having a period.\n\nIf you\u2019re breastfeeding, it\u2019s much easier to be at home. Even if you plan on pumping, it\u2019s a hassle to do this at work.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the hormonal changes. Even if you don\u2019t develop postpartum depression, anxiety or psychosis, you will still experience significant hormonal shifts.\n\nThink back to how your hormones affected you when you were a teenager, then amplify this. Then, throw in caring for an infant. The first few months postpartum are very difficult.\n\nIf you\u2019re fortunate enough to be able to take a year off to care for your baby, you should do it. Your body will thank you for it, and it will give you a priceless amount of time to bond with your baby during his/her first year of life.", "who is more emotional and sensitive to attend needs of others better? who has the breasts to feed? thats not sexist talk, its non delusional talk. of course its an at least 2 person project, but one has to be in charge of the baby. like on top of appointments, its idiosyncrasies... when i take over, i ask my wife where the baby is in its schedule and get a briefing when he was fed and all that.

I developed a bond with my kiddos that I would never have had I not stayed home with them. It was unfortunate with our youngest that I had graduated and began working full time by the time she was born, and I can see the difference in the bond I have with her vs my older children. \n\nLooking back, financially it made more sense to our household that we not put our kids in childcare and that I stayed home. We saved tens of thousands on childcare alone by me staying home. \n\nI'm not saying he's right, and your wrong, or vice versa.

He probably didn't think everything through before talking to you about it, and just assumed that you would.want to be home and that he would work. As a guy I can tell you we assume way more then we probably should, without fully thinking things through. \n\nAlso, I'm gonna throw out a plug here for cloth diapers. I was all for disposable diapers before we had kids, my wife asked me to check out the cloth diapers that she was looking into. Without thinking I shut it down. She came back to me a week or so later with a cost savings breakdown, the structure on how to use, clean and maintain them, along with a promise that if I didn't like.them we would go to disposable diapers. I agreed to give them a few months. We spent $900 total on cloth diapers, cloth wipes, a wipe warmer, a wet bag, and a sprayer for the toilet. Those lasted us three children. $900 for everything we needed for cloth diapers for 3 children!! Then there are places that will buy them, clean and repurpose them, and resell them. Another amazing decision that I was willing to shut down, but my wife made her case and won me over.\n\n\nSo all that being said, make your case, not an argument, explain both sides, address yours and his concerns.

I am a teacher with a teacher\u2019s salary, my wife is an attorney and makes significantly more than me. When we eventually had our first biological child (we fostered and adopted older toddlers for a few years) I feel into the mindset that when it comes to infants a mother should mother. I did not hate my wife, or women, I was just trying to apply my own childhood experiences and expectations watching my mother raise my infant sibling. I was wrong. my experiences growing up weren\u2019t wrong or invalid, but my expectations and application were. This led me to cause a lot of unnecessary tension.\n\nI argued with my wife that our child should stay home, with the \u201cnatural\u201d assumption that my wife be the stay at home partner. My reasons for wanting our child home were legitimate; daycares are petri dishes. In the first month of having our child enrolled in a school we\u2019ve trusted for years with our older children, our infant came home with 3 major infections and we unenrolled her for almost a year. My expectation that my wife eat the sacrifice was not legitimate.\n\nI can say now, on reflection, that my efforts to push my wife to stay at home were a response to a perceived failure on my part. My father didn\u2019t need my mother to work, and was able to keep my siblings and I safely at home until we were old enough. If I let my wife keep working, it must be because I can\u2019t provide enough on my own for my family. If I give up my career, I am admitting failure. Its BS logic, applied to a fundamentally different economy, but it eats a man alive, and the shame makes us lash out at the people who least deserve it. Your husband is being honest when he says he\u2019s feeling emasculated, but you aren\u2019t the one emasculating him; the world today is irreconcilably different then the one we grew up in, where a middle class dad could support a family on his own.\n\nI wish I could give you a solution, but we just got incredibly lucky in our family\u2019s support structure. my wife\u2019s stepmother had just retired and was able to step up where I stubbornly wouldn\u2019t.

You may come to find that you actually do want to stay home\u2026or maybe he realizes he wants to stay home (which is a super manly decision). \n\n5. Whatever you decide, just know that being a stay at home parent is the most intense full time job so discuss your finances from all angles and if either of you does decide to go down that route, the stay at home parent should be compensated with some kind of monthly allowance (or whatever you want to call it) and some designated time off to recharge.", "NTA.\nHis comments are sexist. Period. I make more then my husband (not 3x - you go girl get that bread) but I do make enough to afford all our bills if needed on my income alone. So unless he got a significant pay raise if it came to it he would stay home. He's not because he enjoys work and thankfully we can afford a nanny while we both WFH.\n\nI can't believe you contribute 75% of the income. HE is the one who thinks \"someone\" should stay home for an additional 6 months then say the someone is YOU? You are not a BAD MOM for wanting to return to work. You are allowed to continue your career.\n\nI am obsessed with my daughter. She is 17 months now and if I'm crazy busy at work and can't stop by and say hi for 3-4 hours I miss her. BUT the other day I had to watch her by myself got 6.5 hours and it was exhausting. I am not SAHM material. It takes a special person with a certain willpower and patience. Not something to be forced or guilted into", "Hi OP.  I'm 27w pregnant with my first and currently make \u00d73 what my husband makes.  We barely needed to talk about this, the answer is so obvious.  My husband will be switching to part-time.\n\nNTA.  Living on 1/4th your income when you could be living on 3/4th your income is an obvious financial mistake.  Your husband is being a sexist ass.", "I met some guys in the Army like this, some that straight up said they would never be with a woman who earned more than them.  They are idiots. I make a decent salary as a school administrator, just left the classroom a year ago as a teacher after 10 years. My wife is an attorney, and makes much more. I have been summer camp and daycare for our daughter much more than my wife, and it's great. I do most of the cooking and cleaning etc, because I have the time.\n\nSadly these societal expectations but both ways, my wife constantly deals with feelings that she is a bad mother because she works so much more and doesn't have as much time for our daughter. \n\nWe both hope our daughter grows up seeing that any parent can fill any household role", "From Trevor Noah\u2019s memoir, about his parents: \u201che\u2019s like an exotic bird collector... he only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.\u201d", "I read this post the other day from this \"dad\" whose wife wanted to continue being a SAHM even though the kids were in school/daycare during day now and he was doing drop off and pickup so why would she stay home now and do nothing? Even though with his income they lived more than comfortably and they didn't really need her income at all. I really want to tell him to leave her the fuck alone. She just went through her own personal Vietnam war and she has Mommy PTSD and she needs to stare at a wall with a glass of wine in her hand for at least 2 years to recover. But, in reality she is still responsible for the entire mental load of this family and is probably doing the majority of the house work and maintenance. I could have given him a never ending list of things that woman would still be doing all day and night even with the kids at daycare for a few hours. Her job as a mom didn't stop because you drove off with the kids and dropped them off twenty minutes later.", "NAH. Read the edit, y'all.\n\nFor context, I came here via the rabbit hole because I don't subscribe to this sub. It makes me mad at people that don't have to be on my radar (and may or may not be real), and I like being a happy person. So I opened the link against my conscious better judgement, and I've gotta say this one has a happy ending.\n\nFirst: from all the context, this was their FIRST BIG FIGHT. That's a big deal and a pretty good track record. Met in college, together 8 years? That would be a long con. Before the update, I was thinking Mr. Progressive was finally showing his true colors, and it sounded like OP and the majority of the commenters were too. That's valid, and terrifying. I've been there. But then we find out...\n\nSoon-to-be Mom and Dad talk it out (read: COMMUNICATE, as you do in healthy relationships where safety is valued), and Dad opens up on his underlying issues. I mean, his family (and his culture, if y'all are from the US or many other places) has been giving him the deep-cutting shit about his very identity for just... going about his life. Being a good husband who loves his wife and his job (no small thing at 29) enough to not openly display insecurity from the underlying issues regarding their salaries and the toxic family system he comes from, until he reaches a breaking point. The aftermath reveals his character.\n\nWe find out that he's a good enough dad (already!) to break the cycle by having hard conversations where he communicates his own needs and values, makes the logical compromise based on the needs of his family, and takes responsibility for unhealthy and harmful emotional responses when it's time...before his kid is even born, which takes some foresight. But it gets even better...\n\nThe resolution is THERAPY. Mr. Dad is a Man, because what more responsible outcome and action plan than to *commit to working on yourself* when you realize you've hurt someone due to the toxic systems you've both been a victim of? And that's a hard thing to agree to, and an even harder thing to ask. Real men do the hard thing.\n\nTldr: this post took me for a ride, but the resolution made me happy. Thanks to both of y'all for being a good example for humanity lol", "Thank you so much, this feels really understanding", "My husband and I laugh all the time about how there isn\u2019t much in this world as fragile as a toxic masculine man. They wince back, hiss like cats, change their mind in the middle of things\u2026 panicky denial, whiny cries \u201cbut I\u2019m not a f-g!!!1!\u201d Like bro nobody freakin cares if you put stuff up your butt. Nobody even gives a fuck anyway. What are you even on about lmao.\n\nHave you seen Ted Lasso? Roy Kent, Roy Keeent. That\u2019s a real man right there. His little girl wants to practice painting his nails and he\u2019s like \u201cbang-on, pink for me then\u201d. Hell yeah what a baller", "She\u2019s already likely to face a penalty at work just for having children at all; putting her career completely on hold would be nearly impossible to recover from.", "I love this update. I\u2019m happy for you and your husband that you were able to communicate and figure out what the root of the issue was. I hope he\u2019s able to rise above the comments and realize that providing for his family in the way that makes the most sense (whether that\u2019s staggering leave, him staying home, or contributing to a nanny) is the best thing to do as a man/father, not appeasing people who hold outdated views of familial roles.", "Thank you!", "Abusers get way worse after the birth of a child, because it\u2019s harder to leave someone after that point.", "If it didn't happen on \"Leave it to Beaver,\" they're not interested.", "I was looking for a comment like this. OP and husband will be okay as long as they stay strong despite the surrounding toxic whispers that may poke through in their social circles. Wishing the very best for this couple and their new addition. And if it hasn\u2019t already been said, huge congratulations on incoming baby!!! You will be great parents, just hang in there \u2764\ufe0f", "Yeah, this is absolutely right.", "Because blue is serene and calm. Pink is a shade of red, red is a strong, bold color.", "> had nothing to do with the colour of the sky but of the Virgin Mary\n\nBoth. Mary wearing blue is a representation of the sky, or heaven - in many languages, both are the same word."]}
