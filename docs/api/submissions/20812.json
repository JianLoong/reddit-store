I choose an Ethiopian restaurant, we drove there but then she goes \"I am full, you can eat though I will sit there\". Again we had to go to her restaurant. Another time we chose an Uyghur restaurant. She did the same. I decided not to ever suggest another resraurant. \n\nFew weeks back we were home and both hungry. I told her I was gonna order some food through Ubereats, she asks that I order for her too. I thought about what she liked and ordered 5 different rice and meat dishes (she likes rice and meat) from this amazing Indonesian restaurant. \n\nFood arrives and she throws a tantrum why I didnt order from her favorite restaurant. I asked her to try it. If it is bad, spit it out and I will order from your restaurant. She didnt even taste it despite my begging. She boils some eggs for herself and eats those.\n\nFew weeks later she is ordering some food. I ask she order some for me too. Food arrives and it is 2 dishes, she takes 1 and hands me the other. It is what I hate. I ask why she ordered me this, she goes \"aha, see you hate it when I do it. Then why did you do it to me\". I tried arguing that I had ordered 5 dishes she would have loved if she had tried them. But that she never tried a single bite. On the other hand I have eaten this before and she knows that I hate this. Anyhow I ate it.\n\nYesterday I had a reason to celebrate. Shared the news with her and she says I am buying dinner. I agreed happily. Ordered 6 different dishes from her favorite restaurant. Food arrives and she is shocked. She asks I never asked her what she wanted to eat. I tell her it is from her favorite restaurant and a total of 6 dishes all she likes.\n\nAgain she throws a tantrum saying how could I do it to her again when I myself dont like it when she orders food without asking me what I want. I am baffled and think shes being u reasonable. Again she ate boiled eggs and slept.\n\nI cant figure it out. Am I the asshole here? I have certainly learnt a lesson but just need to know if I was wrong.\n\n*Edit last night when she got angry I asked \"what would you have ordered? She says the lamb bbq (this has 4 skewers). I had actually ordered the mixed bbq plate. This has 2 lamb and a bunch of other skewers. Pointed to it and said she can have both.

You set yourself up for failure.\n\nShe's not much better though.  Her purposefully ordering food she knows you don't like to get back at you is teenager level maturity.

If the answer is that she doesn\u2019t want anything from the restaurant you are ordering from, fine, order for yourself and she can get her own food.

It\u2019s kind of controlling and infantilizing to not let her have a say in her own food.", "NTA. While you can\u2019t force someone to eat what they don\u2019t want, the fact she refused to try anything, then deliberately ordered something she knew you hated, is uncalled for.", "ESH. Y\u2019all are both being childish about this. As a picky eater myself, I try to expand my food horizons by trying new things and I would never expect someone to eat at the same restaurant all the time because that\u2019s what I like. I also hate being asked/expected to eat something if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it (ALL of what\u2019s in it, not just \u201cmeat and rice\u201d). You need to respect her food boundaries and you both need to communicate about it like adults instead of what you\u2019re doing now.", "ESH.  Asking what she wants is important (all communication is) in a healthy relationship.  That said, you do not sound compatible at all and her reaction is over the top and immature.  Are you in high school? Because if not, not talking to each other and retaliating/throwing a tantrum about food is ridiculous.", "NTA. You've asked and made suggestions which she didn't like.  \nYou have every right to try different foods, even if you go off by yourself to do so.  \nShe also has the right to go get food from the places she prefers, without being childish about getting revenge.", "NTA.

You're both making this WAY more complicated than it ever has to be.", "ESH - you both are being petty and seemingly wasting a lot of food, which is also not cool.", "NTA - how old is your girlfriend? Because she sounds like shes barely graduated Kindergarten. I understand being picky, as I myself am extremely picky also. The fact that she straight up refuses to even give new food a try is ridiculous. Then she throws a tantrum when you go out of your way to order from her favorite restaurant and things she does like as well? It literally doesn't even make sense. \n\nAlso, her ordering something you've previously tried and didn't like at all is petty.\n\nTo be honest, the next time you want to go out, pick the restaurant you want. If she doesn't eat, that's on her. You're always giving into her needs and wants and you need to put your foot down and put yourself first for once.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to broaden her palate with some new restaurants and SHE chose to be a brat about it.  Next time you decide to go to a new restaurant and she pulls the \"I'm full, but you eat\" DO IT.  Don't leave and go to HER favorite.  That is unfair to you.  Go to the new restaurant, enjoy your dinner, and if she suffers because SHE is choosing to be a brat, then she can go hungry.   \n\nYou tried several times to order food you though she would like and SHE *chose* not to try them.  SHE did.  Then she thought she'd \"do the same to you\".  But she actually DID pick a dish she knew you wouldn't like.  Not something you hadn't tried...something you specifically didn't like.  \n\nYou ordered dishes she actually LIKES from HER restaurant.

And she is being difficult with food choices.  \n\n\nI'd recommend that both of you either come to a compromise or find better partners.", "ESH.  This is a communication problem deeper than what to eat. You're right,  you can't read her mind and she's being weird telling you to order her something and then being mad when the food isn't what she wants.  But you shouldn't assume something similar to what she likes is the same as what she wants. I have favorite dishes from the same restaurant but sometimes I prefer a different meal.\n\nYou're both going in circles over this. Ordering food is just hiding the real problem.", "I mean, a lot of this isn\u2019t about being TA. The situations are also all different ones. \n\nFor instance, I think the ones like the Ethiopian restaurant is possibly N A H \u2014 she\u2019s not into it and I get how is awkward to have her there not eating, but people should be able to eat what they want. It\u2019s weird she only likes one restaurant. But being odd doesn\u2019t make her an AH, though it can be a dealbreaker for you. But she was not being rude necessarily, she accompanied you and didn\u2019t want that food. I get that\u2019s annoying but that\u2019s who you\u2019re dating. \n\nI think the you ordering food is kind of E S H. She assumed her restaurant, but then again that\u2019s her only restaurant so maybe the assumption made sense? You should have been clear where you were ordering from, possibly in that case, and you certainly seem to really really be forcing her to \u201ctry\u201d stuff which is never a good attitude for adults and food. \n\nHer ordering you what you hate is N T A unless you kept bringing up her eating stuff she didn\u2019t want to maybe, but I don\u2019t understand why you ate it. That was her being petty and mean either way though.\n\nYou ordering from her restaurant without asking her seems E S H ish since she was buying especially. I mean asking is normal and it doesn\u2019t sound like she asked you to choose? You just assumed? And bought 6 dishes but not what she actually wanted, so I can see that being annoying. Idk, many people dislike others ordering for them but she seems really intense overall. N T A if you didn\u2019t know any better but it feels like you\u2019ve been low key battling over food and engaging in that actively so partly on you.\n\nOverall ESH and y\u2019all need better communication. But it does sound like, from your perspective though, she\u2019s the more difficult one. But you both sound not great.", "ESH. Reading this is exhausting. You're both petty and incapable of communicating properly.\n\nIt wouldn't have been hard for you to say \"I'm ordering from X, what would you like?\" Or her when asking saying \"Can you order me Y\"\n\nI have a suspicion that your gf may be neurodivergent in some form. From my experience, reacting that way to a new food that they don't know for certain they like is pretty common. Certainly for the first time. The second time she sounds like she's being an A H, as what she wanted was included in what you ordered.\n\nHer specifically ordering what you hate is an A H move. And you probably should have asked when you ordered from her favourite place after the fight last time.\n\nYou both sound too immature for a relationship, and your food pallettes might genuinely be a cause to break up because this shit isn't healthy and I can see it causing many fights and all sorts of resentment in the future.", "ESH. It\u2019s not about food - it\u2019s about control. You\u2019re both trying to have control in your lives and food is how it plays out, yet neither of you respects your partner\u2019s need for control. I get that it\u2019s exhausting feeling like you\u2019re the one who always has to compromise. So why compromise? Instead, try turn taking. If that won\u2019t work, then just eat separate meals. And if that wont work, the relationship isn\u2019t going anywhere so it\u2019s probably time to break up.", "Was it a tantrum, really? Or did she just not react like you expected?

However, there is a simple solution to this issue: communication. If you're wanting to try something new, it is probably best you both get your food from different locations.

Otherwise, you can anticipate her frustration and disappointment.", "YTA.  And wtf!  Why is it so important for you to order for her without asking?!  It's a weird and bizarre power play.

It\u2019s not an issue if she doesn\u2019t like going outside her comfort zone food-wise but it\u2019s a problem that she never compromises. Meaning you\u2019re always defaulting to her choices and you don\u2019t get to explore any of the places you were looking forward to \u2014 that would seriously bum me out and I can imagine can lead to resentment because in our minds we\u2019re incapable of understanding why someone can\u2019t just take a bite of something, try it and be done with it if they don\u2019t like it. Right? Like JUST TRY IT. \n\nSo I can see you thinking that buying 5 different dishes just for her to try is an act of love (I\u2019d love that) but she doesn\u2019t share your mindset so to her it feels like you\u2019re taking away her autonomy. That\u2019s why she pulled that super petty move and ordered a dish she knew you didn\u2019t like. \n\nUltimately? You either stop trying to get her to try new foods and just order separate meals from different restaurants or you just go your separate ways. You should also start asking her what she wants instead of guessing \u2014 she\u2019s told you she doesn\u2019t like surprises multiple times now so it\u2019s about time you get it. She has a much different mindset than you when it comes to food and you need to respect that if you want to be together. That being said, she could afford to be more flexible. Both of you need to have a serious convo about how to deal with this moving forward because it\u2019s not just you that needs to change.

For brand B they make it how I like: a noodle, 10 mushrooms cut in tiny pieces, lots of cheese, all the above swiming in sauce. I will never order this dish anywhere, only under the B brand. So even if you think she likes the dish, there might be some nuances why she only wants it from the certain restaurant.

You aren\u2019t going to make her into an adventurous eater.", "Food can be a source of many legitimate issues. It's a direct example of something we put into our bodies, and so for some people, controlling what they eat is a way to make them feel they have control over their lives. Abuse can included controlling access to food, or shaming people for what they eat.  The media fixates so much on what people should be eating (especially for women), that it can be hard to shake the voice that judges everything you put in your mouth. Eating disorders are far too common, and often become a life long struggle. Many neurodivergent people have sensory issues with eating. And so on. \n\nI'm not suggesting any of these are going on with OP's girlfriend (although her falling on boiled eggs does make me wonder if she has some sensory issues). However, it's very possible that her food preferences are a complicated issue. It's not a simple case of \"varied and adventurous food good, narrow range of food bad!\"\n\nWhatever the issue, OP, trying to force her into eating new things isn't the answer. You are, whether you intend to or not, trying to control what she eats. She's a person and she has the right to choose what she wants to eat. It also comes off as more than a little judgmental. It's an action that indicates you don't care what she wants, because you think you know better. I'd also be upset if someone did this to me, especially repeatedly. It might be just food to you, but to her you're taking away a choice that should be hers. \n\nThat said, I think her behaviour in response is not helpful. \n\nThe two of you appear to be fundamentally incompatible when it comes to food. That doesn't mean the relationship is doomed. There's a room for you to have a mature and empathetic  conversation to understand each other's approaches to food, and then to compromise.
