I choose an Ethiopian restaurant, we drove there but then she goes \"I am full, you can eat though I will sit there\". Again we had to go to her restaurant. Another time we chose an Uyghur restaurant. She did the same. I decided not to ever suggest another resraurant. \n\nFew weeks back we were home and both hungry. I told her I was gonna order some food through Ubereats, she asks that I order for her too. I thought about what she liked and ordered 5 different rice and meat dishes (she likes rice and meat) from this amazing Indonesian restaurant. \n\nFood arrives and she throws a tantrum why I didnt order from her favorite restaurant. I asked her to try it. If it is bad, spit it out and I will order from your restaurant. She didnt even taste it despite my begging. She boils some eggs for herself and eats those.\n\nFew weeks later she is ordering some food. I ask she order some for me too. Food arrives and it is 2 dishes, she takes 1 and hands me the other. It is what I hate. I ask why she ordered me this, she goes \"aha, see you hate it when I do it. Then why did you do it to me\". I tried arguing that I had ordered 5 dishes she would have loved if she had tried them. But that she never tried a single bite. On the other hand I have eaten this before and she knows that I hate this. Anyhow I ate it.\n\nYesterday I had a reason to celebrate. Shared the news with her and she says I am buying dinner. I agreed happily. Ordered 6 different dishes from her favorite restaurant. Food arrives and she is shocked. She asks I never asked her what she wanted to eat. I tell her it is from her favorite restaurant and a total of 6 dishes all she likes.\n\nAgain she throws a tantrum saying how could I do it to her again when I myself dont like it when she orders food without asking me what I want. I am baffled and think shes being u reasonable. Again she ate boiled eggs and slept.\n\nI cant figure it out. Am I the asshole here? I have certainly learnt a lesson but just need to know if I was wrong.\n\n*Edit last night when she got angry I asked \"what would you have ordered? She says the lamb bbq (this has 4 skewers). I had actually ordered the mixed bbq plate. This has 2 lamb and a bunch of other skewers. Pointed to it and said she can have both.

You set yourself up for failure.\n\nShe's not much better though.  Her purposefully ordering food she knows you don't like to get back at you is teenager level maturity.

If the answer is that she doesn\u2019t want anything from the restaurant you are ordering from, fine, order for yourself and she can get her own food.

It\u2019s kind of controlling and infantilizing to not let her have a say in her own food.", "NTA.

Y\u2019all are both being childish about this. As a picky eater myself, I try to expand my food horizons by trying new things and I would never expect someone to eat at the same restaurant all the time because that\u2019s what I like. I also hate being asked/expected to eat something if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it (ALL of what\u2019s in it, not just \u201cmeat and rice\u201d). You need to respect her food boundaries and you both need to communicate about it like adults instead of what you\u2019re doing now.", "ESH.

Are you in high school? Because if not, not talking to each other and retaliating/throwing a tantrum about food is ridiculous.", "NTA. You've asked and made suggestions which she didn't like.  \nYou have every right to try different foods, even if you go off by yourself to do so.  \nShe also has the right to go get food from the places she prefers, without being childish about getting revenge.", "NTA.

You're both making this WAY more complicated than it ever has to be.", "ESH - you both are being petty and seemingly wasting a lot of food, which is also not cool.", "NTA - how old is your girlfriend? Because she sounds like shes barely graduated Kindergarten. I understand being picky, as I myself am extremely picky also. The fact that she straight up refuses to even give new food a try is ridiculous. Then she throws a tantrum when you go out of your way to order from her favorite restaurant and things she does like as well? It literally doesn't even make sense. \n\nAlso, her ordering something you've previously tried and didn't like at all is petty.\n\nTo be honest, the next time you want to go out, pick the restaurant you want. If she doesn't eat, that's on her. You're always giving into her needs and wants and you need to put your foot down and put yourself first for once.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to broaden her palate with some new restaurants and SHE chose to be a brat about it.  Next time you decide to go to a new restaurant and she pulls the \"I'm full, but you eat\" DO IT.  Don't leave and go to HER favorite.  That is unfair to you.  Go to the new restaurant, enjoy your dinner, and if she suffers because SHE is choosing to be a brat, then she can go hungry.   \n\nYou tried several times to order food you though she would like and SHE *chose* not to try them.  SHE did.  Then she thought she'd \"do the same to you\".  But she actually DID pick a dish she knew you wouldn't like.  Not something you hadn't tried...something you specifically didn't like.  \n\nYou ordered dishes she actually LIKES from HER restaurant.

And she is being difficult with food choices.  \n\n\nI'd recommend that both of you either come to a compromise or find better partners.", "ESH.  This is a communication problem deeper than what to eat. You're right,  you can't read her mind and she's being weird telling you to order her something and then being mad when the food isn't what she wants.  But you shouldn't assume something similar to what she likes is the same as what she wants. I have favorite dishes from the same restaurant but sometimes I prefer a different meal.\n\nYou're both going in circles over this. Ordering food is just hiding the real problem.", "I mean, a lot of this isn\u2019t about being TA. The situations are also all different ones. \n\nFor instance, I think the ones like the Ethiopian restaurant is possibly N A H \u2014 she\u2019s not into it and I get how is awkward to have her there not eating, but people should be able to eat what they want. It\u2019s weird she only likes one restaurant. But being odd doesn\u2019t make her an AH, though it can be a dealbreaker for you. But she was not being rude necessarily, she accompanied you and didn\u2019t want that food. I get that\u2019s annoying but that\u2019s who you\u2019re dating. \n\nI think the you ordering food is kind of E S H. She assumed her restaurant, but then again that\u2019s her only restaurant so maybe the assumption made sense? You should have been clear where you were ordering from, possibly in that case, and you certainly seem to really really be forcing her to \u201ctry\u201d stuff which is never a good attitude for adults and food. \n\nHer ordering you what you hate is N T A unless you kept bringing up her eating stuff she didn\u2019t want to maybe, but I don\u2019t understand why you ate it. That was her being petty and mean either way though.\n\nYou ordering from her restaurant without asking her seems E S H ish since she was buying especially. I mean asking is normal and it doesn\u2019t sound like she asked you to choose? You just assumed? And bought 6 dishes but not what she actually wanted, so I can see that being annoying. Idk, many people dislike others ordering for them but she seems really intense overall. N T A if you didn\u2019t know any better but it feels like you\u2019ve been low key battling over food and engaging in that actively so partly on you.\n\nOverall ESH and y\u2019all need better communication. But it does sound like, from your perspective though, she\u2019s the more difficult one. But you both sound not great.", "ESH. Reading this is exhausting. You're both petty and incapable of communicating properly.\n\nIt wouldn't have been hard for you to say \"I'm ordering from X, what would you like?\" Or her when asking saying \"Can you order me Y\"\n\nI have a suspicion that your gf may be neurodivergent in some form. From my experience, reacting that way to a new food that they don't know for certain they like is pretty common. Certainly for the first time. The second time she sounds like she's being an A H, as what she wanted was included in what you ordered.\n\nHer specifically ordering what you hate is an A H move. And you probably should have asked when you ordered from her favourite place after the fight last time.\n\nYou both sound too immature for a relationship, and your food pallettes might genuinely be a cause to break up because this shit isn't healthy and I can see it causing many fights and all sorts of resentment in the future.", "ESH. It\u2019s not about food - it\u2019s about control. You\u2019re both trying to have control in your lives and food is how it plays out, yet neither of you respects your partner\u2019s need for control. I get that it\u2019s exhausting feeling like you\u2019re the one who always has to compromise. So why compromise? Instead, try turn taking. If that won\u2019t work, then just eat separate meals. And if that wont work, the relationship isn\u2019t going anywhere so it\u2019s probably time to break up.", "Was it a tantrum, really? Or did she just not react like you expected?

However, there is a simple solution to this issue: communication. If you're wanting to try something new, it is probably best you both get your food from different locations.

Otherwise, you can anticipate her frustration and disappointment.", "YTA.  And wtf!  Why is it so important for you to order for her without asking?!  It's a weird and bizarre power play.

It\u2019s not an issue if she doesn\u2019t like going outside her comfort zone food-wise but it\u2019s a problem that she never compromises. Meaning you\u2019re always defaulting to her choices and you don\u2019t get to explore any of the places you were looking forward to \u2014 that would seriously bum me out and I can imagine can lead to resentment because in our minds we\u2019re incapable of understanding why someone can\u2019t just take a bite of something, try it and be done with it if they don\u2019t like it. Right? Like JUST TRY IT. \n\nSo I can see you thinking that buying 5 different dishes just for her to try is an act of love (I\u2019d love that) but she doesn\u2019t share your mindset so to her it feels like you\u2019re taking away her autonomy.

She has a much different mindset than you when it comes to food and you need to respect that if you want to be together. That being said, she could afford to be more flexible. Both of you need to have a serious convo about how to deal with this moving forward because it\u2019s not just you that needs to change.

So even if you think she likes the dish, there might be some nuances why she only wants it from the certain restaurant.

You aren\u2019t going to make her into an adventurous eater.", "Food can be a source of many legitimate issues. It's a direct example of something we put into our bodies, and so for some people, controlling what they eat is a way to make them feel they have control over their lives. Abuse can included controlling access to food, or shaming people for what they eat.  The media fixates so much on what people should be eating (especially for women), that it can be hard to shake the voice that judges everything you put in your mouth. Eating disorders are far too common, and often become a life long struggle. Many neurodivergent people have sensory issues with eating. And so on. \n\nI'm not suggesting any of these are going on with OP's girlfriend (although her falling on boiled eggs does make me wonder if she has some sensory issues). However, it's very possible that her food preferences are a complicated issue. It's not a simple case of \"varied and adventurous food good, narrow range of food bad!\"\n\nWhatever the issue, OP, trying to force her into eating new things isn't the answer. You are, whether you intend to or not, trying to control what she eats. She's a person and she has the right to choose what she wants to eat. It also comes off as more than a little judgmental. It's an action that indicates you don't care what she wants, because you think you know better. I'd also be upset if someone did this to me, especially repeatedly. It might be just food to you, but to her you're taking away a choice that should be hers. \n\nThat said, I think her behaviour in response is not helpful. \n\nThe two of you appear to be fundamentally incompatible when it comes to food. That doesn't mean the relationship is doomed. There's a room for you to have a mature and empathetic  conversation to understand each other's approaches to food, and then to compromise. However, I have no faith either of you is capable of that.

I know the difference between meatloaf and a burger but they try to gaslight you.\n\nI am picky but I will try to find something on the menu I can eat. But, people with less sensitive palates try to tell you how things taste. I have discovered that I am a supertaster, which is someone with a lot of tastebuds. Not everyone has the same number. We tend to taste bitter things very strongly and can separate out tastes that others can't. Don't tell me what I taste! Just because it tastes great to you doesn't mean I'm being spoiled or lazy or that I have the palate of a child. This is what they believe since their experience is deemed the ONLY experience. \n\nWith that being said, I WISH I wasn't picky but I cannot change it. I would love to have multiple options at every restaurant (although, my indecisiveness might come into play then) and not have to worry about being able to eat at a party. I often pre-eat and then nibble on the few things I like. It's not fun to be this way but people always put you down as if you're just being stubborn. \n\nAbout supertasters: Scientists placed a chemical on a piece of paper and told people to taste it. Some people tasted nothing. Some people tasted something but not unpleasant. For supertasters, it tasted like bug spray. If you look at the \"non-taster's\" tongue, it looks very different from a supertaster. It almost looks smooth. Mine looks almost hairy like you could practically comb the tastebuds when you separate them.\n\nA simple test for supertasters. Put a drop of blue food coloring on your tongue. Get a piece of paper with a binder hole punched in it. Place the hole on your tongue (of course, tear it off the larger piece of paper) and count the number of tastebuds you see inside the hole. If you are above 30, you're a supertaster.\n\nAll of this being said, YTA. You seem to think that, since you believe your taste is impeccable, she should like whatever you order. Even if she does, why don't you want to give her the chance to choose what she wants each time? She may not be in the mood for what you ordered and wanted something else on the menu, even at her favorite place. Yet, you keep insisting on trying to get her to try new things she doesn't want to try. Why are you so controlling about this and why won't you simply ask her what she wants you to order?\n\nSaying that, she needs to be more flexible instead of always eating at her favorite place. But that doesn't mean she needs to eat more \"exotic\" food that you want but that she needs to find other places where she likes a few things that she can order. You can get tired of the same place, even if you love it. (Although, when you are picky, you often eat the same things a lot.) But, YTA because you don't want to accommodate her and order what she wants. You're too focused on getting her to eat something ELSE. Why is it so important to you to change her and force her to be like you? She ISN'T you and has a right to want what she wants and to dislike what she dislikes without being made to feel bad about it.", "This isn\u2019t even the point tho. You at least tried the meatloaf to learn that. OP\u2019s gf wouldn\u2019t even try the *5 different* dishes that were chosen based on things she does like to see if she liked them.", "Sounds a bit... well OP might want to think about the skin colour of the people who usually eat the foods gf objects to the most.\n\nRegardless, these two peole might not be compatible. Eating together is an act of love and community and they don't seem to be able to do it.", "He said she said he was buying, not choosing.

If you're really into food and cuisines and culture it can be a big part of your hobbies/free time, and since it's directly tied to meals and eating, the clash is bigger than just picky vs non-picky. \n\nFood can definitely be a love language and important bonding experience for some, and that can translate to a fundamental incompatibility.", "He said he was ordering food and she told him to get her something. She did not specify that she expected him to order her something from a different restaurant.", "Yeah, im a bit of a picky eater so only like onions, ketchup, and mustard on burgers which is not enough to mask the different taste of a beyond beef/impossible burger. I still kinda enjoy the meat substitutes, but they definitely Dont compare to real beef.", "Mouthfeel: ground beef, one with some breadcrumbs added\n\nFlavor profile: ground beef and ketchup\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nI get that they're not exactly the same but I'm sorry, if you like one but not the other then it's mostly psychological and you're an interminably fussy eater.", "And he knows she's quite particular about what she's gonna eat, and doesn't check. Just assumes", "That\u2019s an extremely ableist take.  Food aversions and sensitivities are incredibly common among neurodivergent people, and eating food that triggers those sensitivities and aversions can literally make us physically ill.

He has something to celebrate, she tells HIM that he's ordering dinner, so why would she not just include what she wants then? It doesn't make sense to me to say well you didn't ask me what I wanted when you made the first decision. I honestly think he is trying to make her happy and not trying to force new food on her as he ordered from her favorite restaurant and ordered things he knows she likes, as proven by him getting it right.", "He should take her at her word that she's not hungry but will sit with him. My partner and I aren't always food genre compatible so sometimes one of us will eat first and just go for a drink - this comes in handy for group dining too. It really doesn't have to be as hard as OP and gf are making it.", "Yes, I also have the impression that this isn't about the food, but about control. She doesn't want you to decide for her (even if she said so the first time). And she doesn't seem to enjoy to go to the restaurant. So if you want to eat in an exotic restaurant, go with a friend. If you order food, let her order for herself. If your relation is good otherwise, it would be silly to make this a mayor problem.", "I can't stand going to restaurants with one person who isn't eating. I'd rather not eat at that point, its so awkward and uncomfortable for me.", "Exactly my thoughts- how can you, as a child, build a healthy relation to the food, seeing this kind of behaviour in your home?", "I\u2019m a little like this. I can try new foods and it\u2019s getting easier as I\u2019m getting older but it has to me on \u2018my terms\u2019, like I\u2019ve decided to try it before hand, I\u2019m feeling comfortable (not anxious or low), etc. some food I\u2019m almost\u2026 scared of? It freaks me out. But I manage to work around it because it\u2019s my problem. I can eat at most restaurants (even if it\u2019s chicken balls and chips at a Chinese) and if worst comes to worst, we get separate meals and eat them together. \n\nId struggle being with someone super adventurous with food, but for 95% of people I can get along with them fine. It\u2019s weird to me because I\u2019d always specify what I want to eat, because I\u2019m picky and I want to be sure someone gets the right order. And if I don\u2019t say, then they ask me, rather than honestly quite rudely forcing me into something I\u2019m nervous and strange with (OP doesn\u2019t know she will love something, and new food, even if I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll probably like it, can be\u2026 an event? If that makes sense) Equally it\u2019s a little childish to order in revenge. It just seems like they\u2019re both stubborn, and this part of life might be so different that, with their stubborn nature, it\u2019s causing a major rift (and it will carry on - food is a continuous thing)", "Right, he didn\u2019t order the meal that he knows she wants. He ordered 6 (because he has a habit of ordering a weirdly extreme amount of food) random dishes from her favorite restaurant. Just coming from the same restaurant doesn\u2019t make it the meal she wants. Notice she didn\u2019t have to ask him what he wanted, she knew exactly which dish he didn\u2019t like when she was being petty to make a point. I\u2019d wager he knows what meals she actually wants and was trying to get her try new food again", "I too would rather eat alone. Having someone staring at you while you eat and they aren't is so uncomfortable and awkward for me. I'd rather just go home amd not eat at that point.", "Idk, as someone who has serious anxiety with trying new foods, I understand the girlfriend a little, especially since my boyfriend too believes in constantly trying new foods and flavors. I've made it very clear to him that trying new foods has been a life long battle and I don't intend to make dinner time more difficult for myself then it needs to be. \n\nI understand food is culturally significant to many people and sitting down with someone and enjoying the same food is part of the experience, but its not to me. I have been made to feel guilty for not participating in different food exchanges growing up and let me tell you, it has only added to my anxity. To the point where I won\u2019t go to family functions if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s being served because I\u2019m so scared of offending the host for not eating their food. It has nothing to do with them, their culture, how they prepare it, how it\u2019s presented. If theres even one questionable ingredient or weird looking smell/texture my body will not allow me to eat it. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve even told Myself I would eat it, that\u2019s there\u2019s no reason why I wouldn\u2019t like it, and those instances have resulted in my being sick. \n\n\nAnd whenever my boyfriend expresses his dislike that I won\u2019t eat with him at different types of restaurants or won\u2019t try new foods, i understand why he\u2019s upset but this has been a part of who i am since the beginning and I\u2019ve been clear it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to change.

Let them be picky jerks. You don't owe then anything.", "I would say \u201cI am ordering from X restaurant, if you want food from somewhere else, you need to order it yourself\u201d. \n\nAlso, start going to new restaurants in your own, or with friends.

She doesn\u2019t want you to decide what she would want. She wants you to *ask her*. Yes, even if you\u2019re planning to order things that she\u2019s liked before from her favorite restaurant. The process of picking her food needs to be hers, not yours. Maybe it\u2019s about what she feels in the moment. I get that her pickiness and lack of interest in trying new things is annoying, but that\u2019s a separate issue (though you\u2019re probably setting it off with trying to think around her and not consulting her on the new restaurants you chose).

I used to travel to Asia regularly, know what's good in authentic restaurants, and know what BF likes to eat.

It's only about 1 out of 10 meals that he doesn't really know what he's getting, but my batting average is 1.000 on ordering for him when he doesn't understand the menu. :)", "NTA. Your girlfriend sounds like an A H though. Can\u2019t believe she would refuse to even try a bite of any of the 5-6 dishes you ordered and would rather eat boiled eggs.

Please, for your own sakes, learn how to communicate. Your partner assumed you were ordering from her favourite restaurant, and you never clarified.

Do you ever talk to one another?  \nShe's made clear she doesn't like not having input on what she's going to eat, and she has some serious anxiety or other hang ups about trying new things. It sucks for you, because you want to try new foods, but it's just not something she's interested in doing. C'est la vie, my dude. Make a foodie friend and go with them, or order from two different places.

There are some burgers I hate. Same with fries. I only like how my husband makes steak. No restaurant can compare.  Beef stew... I prefer mine... he adds stuff when he makes it. My food preferences have become more important as I got older because over time, I've noticed some recipes effect how I feel the next day.  So I don't eat at those places anymore.  Like ginger is very popular right now. 15 years ago I didn't have to worry it would show up in a burger. Now I do.", "I would say that it is her form of a compromise. She did understand that her partner has the need to try different things to eat that she does not want to eat.

If I am fed up with eating the same every time we go out we might split up and everybody gets their own take out and we will eat it somewhere together. \n\nIf we are in vacation we might have to go to two different restaurants.\n\nYou can absolutly sit together and watch someone eat their meal while you are just having something to drink. I am not sure why they had to go to the favorite restaurant of his girlfriend again. She was even polite enough to say that she is full and not that she does not like it. He would have had his meal and she would most likely have sit through it in peace. Maybe she would have even tryed some of his meal as a small bite. Maybe not. We will never know, because op decided that he cannot eat of she is not eating.", "Or if OP hands her the menu and she says she doesn\u2019t want to order from there he could just reply \u201cokay cool, this is where I\u2019m ordering from though so if you want something else order it, it\u2019s fine\u201d \n\nI get when you go to a restaurant you both have to eat at the same place, but ordering food in? Just both order from where you want and get them delivered at the same time.\n\nEveryone in them is scenario needs to stop being so entitled and thinking they know/deserve best", "That would definitely work for them if they wanted it to.
