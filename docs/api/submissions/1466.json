This really hurt my feelings and I am upset. \n\nI have not said anything much other than \"Thanks for letting me know\". Am I being selfish or outlandish by feeling upset??? I have the impuse to tell her when I see her, that I personally would not change up the plans for an interantional trip just like that.

An example is her obsession with her romantic relationships to the point that I rarely see her. The last night of my stay at her home (in her state), she ditched me to cheat on her boyfriend. I feel like she will get very angry at me and never speak to me again if I brought up how I felt in those situations, let alone feeling upset over this trip.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She can't control what happens because she's not paying for it. It's her mother that's paying for it and more than likely invited the relatives or got wind of it because how much they were talking about it. While I get that you're disappointed, you shouldn't be mad at your friend because she's more than likely disappointed herself that it turned into a family thing.", "NTA You've invested so much time and energy into this trip and you were so excited that you made all of this arrangements just to be told that it's a no go...\n\nThat isn't a true friend \ud83d\ude15", "You are not be selfish or outlandis or any other word. This is shitty behavior and I hope you ask about the money you've already invested. And I'm not so sure she'll be such a good friend if this is the way it goes. NTA", "NTA - I would think it odd if you WEREN\u2019T upset!\n\nYou\u2019d been making plans with her and her family? Then they just pull the rug from under you? Had you booked you flight yet? \n\nDid something happen between you and your friend that would make her not want you there, like the \u201cit\u2019s not a family trip\u201d is a made up excuse?\n\nThis seems like such a weird flip\u2026\n\nETA: I just read your summary. She seems like a terrible friend anyway. Friends shouldn\u2019t discount your feelings so easily, this is not a bad reason to dump a \u201cfriend\u201d", "NTA. She's not a good friend if she pulls crap like that on you. Maybe it's time to reconsider if this is a friendship you wanna keep or drop like a bad habit.", "She invited you. Parents were good with you as a guest, and you even visited them to discuss the trip and hang out. And now, Surprise!  Yeah, that's RIDICULOUS.  Most of us think we can rely upon a friend, and value promises made. You mention being financially invested in this trip, having purchased an airline ticket, and rejecting other celebratory options for this opportunity.\n\nYeah, there's some shady sh*t going on here with your \"friend\", and I don't think you're going to get the whole story from her. Probably healthy to let this relationship go. And no, you're NTA. Hope you can get a refund, or maybe find a hostel or other lodging situation and have an adventure you'll enjoy, 'cuz you are NTA here!", "First of all, feeling something does not make you an AH or not. It\u2019s your actions that decide whether you fit into the NTA or YTA category. You have the right to your feelings, and I would also be upset in this situation. You remained calm and cordial which shows a lot of poise in your situation. Based on the story, this friend sounds quite unreliable, although I do understand that this is not all in her control either. Whatever the situation might be, don\u2019t put any money into it as it seems to be quite shaky."]}
