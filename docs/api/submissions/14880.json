This friend asked me for details on my own gender reveal party and she had some questions about it. \n\nShe asked me why I had it in Abu Dhabi instead of the US. For context, my husband and I are Indian Americans, but our entire extended family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) are back in India. Due to some family problems, I basically spent my entire pregnancy in India. I even gave birth there. \n\nIt is illegal to find out the gender of your baby in India. There was a preference for boys over girls, so this was done in order to curb sex selective abortions. \n\nHowever I had really wanted a gender reveal party, and we had a lot of friends living in the UAE. It was easier, and cheaper to go to the UAE than go back home. I flew to Abu Dhabi, found out the gender, and had a party. It wasn't a very big party, but I did put in a lot of effort into it. \n\nFunnily enough, my friend seemed more upset that I had \"ignored the rules of a country I was staying in\". She started telling our mutual friends that my husband and I have way too much money to burn. When I asked her why she was doing this, she just told me \"If you were going to stay in India during your pregnancy, you should've just followed their rules. I hate when people spend money on stupid things like this, it makes me so angry\" \n\nBut even if you think it's stupid, it's not like I was spending your money. She hasn't been very friendly to me since. However, a few days ago I got a text from her saying that she's upset I agreed to plan her event but I haven't been \"myself\" about it. I've planned events for other mutual friends, so she knows I really throw myself into the planning, which I haven't really done for her.

Your money to burn, your friend has no say.\n\nBut as a South Asian woman I'll just say this - you know that sex-selective abortions are rampant in India, which is why gender is not disclosed.

There were, in 1990, 100 million missing women in India - result of sex-selective abortions This has had devastating impacts on India's gender parity.\n\nWas it so important for you, even knowing this history, to go to Abu Dhabi, and have a gender reveal?!

If my friends told me they were hopping on a plane to fly two states over to find out the gender of their baby, I'd roll my eyes and mock them too.    Like, this information is not worth spending thousands of dollars to learn.  It's not worth spending anything to learn.  The kid is going to come out whatever it's going to come out.  What does learning it 4 months earlier do for you exactly?  Like I get finding out the gender in the general course of your healthcare, you get an ultrasound and there's information there, get it.

I get it's a celebration, but WHY is that particular bit of information celebrated?  If you found out your babies eye color before birth would anyone throw a \"Eye Color reveal party\"?!  The whole concept is strange to me.  So yeah, it's not the distance exactly, it's that I find the whole idea absurd to begin with and the idea of spending massive amounts of money on this is to me like someone spending 100,000 on a purse.  Like if that's your thing, do it absolutely, if you can afford it, DO IT, if that's your jam.  But I find it ... just bizarre.  And I would totally mock my friends for it.

It's just a mutt! If you breed a labrador to a poodle it's a mutt!  And you are paying huge dollars for it.  Anyway.
