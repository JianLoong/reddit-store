I really enjoy party planning and I love to do it for other people, especially my friends. This friend asked me for details on my own gender reveal party and she had some questions about it. \n\nShe asked me why I had it in Abu Dhabi instead of the US. For context, my husband and I are Indian Americans, but our entire extended family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) are back in India. Due to some family problems, I basically spent my entire pregnancy in India. I even gave birth there. \n\nIt is illegal to find out the gender of your baby in India. There was a preference for boys over girls, so this was done in order to curb sex selective abortions. \n\nHowever I had really wanted a gender reveal party, and we had a lot of friends living in the UAE. It was easier, and cheaper to go to the UAE than go back home. I flew to Abu Dhabi, found out the gender, and had a party. It wasn't a very big party, but I did put in a lot of effort into it. \n\nFunnily enough, my friend seemed more upset that I had \"ignored the rules of a country I was staying in\". She started telling our mutual friends that my husband and I have way too much money to burn. When I asked her why she was doing this, she just told me \"If you were going to stay in India during your pregnancy, you should've just followed their rules. I hate when people spend money on stupid things like this, it makes me so angry\" \n\nBut even if you think it's stupid, it's not like I was spending your money. She hasn't been very friendly to me since. However, a few days ago I got a text from her saying that she's upset I agreed to plan her event but I haven't been \"myself\" about it. I've planned events for other mutual friends, so she knows I really throw myself into the planning, which I haven't really done for her. She says she hopes I'm not interpreting the things she said  in a bad way because most people would probably react like her if I told them I went to another country just to find out my baby's gender.", "created_utc": 1681586832, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nfl74/aita_for_admitting_that_i_went_abroad_to_find_out/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her pregnancy, she decided how to handle finding out about the gender. Your pregnancy is yours to deal with how you choose, and I don\u2019t think it matters what country you were staying in when you decided that you wanted to find out your baby\u2019s gender.

You also WNBTA if you told her that because of your current strained relationship, it would be best if she found someone else to plan her party--unless she's paying you market value, in which case you need to be professional about it and separate personal from work.", "How were you not supposed to interpret what she said in a \"bad way\"? She insults you to your face, talks behind your back and then wants you to go all out for her celebration? She doesn't sound like a friend tbh.

She attacked your choices, like this was some personal affront to her, and now realizing she put her foot in her mouth, now she wants to convince you it you who is the problem. I'd cancel the job (and the \"friendship\"), you aren't feeling it, and you don't have to. And if she's paying you for this, wouldn't it be hypocritical for her to fund your \"too much money to burn\" lifestyle? Really, you'd be doing her a favor by not doing the job.

I\u2019d\u2026idk. I\u2019d rethink that friendship. Your friend was clearly in the wrong to say what she said about \u201cdisrespecting the rules\u201d (like, what? No.) so NTA, but your choices frankly *were* insanely ridiculous.

Huge, flashing-neon lights AH for having a gender reveal party in 2023.

Downvote away.\n\nedit: typo", "NTA, in this case. Your money to burn, your friend has no say.\n\nBut as a South Asian woman I'll just say this - you know that sex-selective abortions are rampant in India, which is why gender is not disclosed. It is not a past problem, it's ongoing. In many states in India, especially in the north and north-west, ratio of women to men is about 700-1000. There were, in 1990, 100 million missing women in India - result of sex-selective abortions This has had devastating impacts on India's gender parity.\n\nWas it so important for you, even knowing this history, to go to Abu Dhabi, and have a gender reveal?! In any case, you do you. Celebrate your baby any way you want.

The United States is so big that I equate interstate travel with European travel and view it the same.  If my friends told me they were hopping on a plane to fly two states over to find out the gender of their baby, I'd roll my eyes and mock them too.    Like, this information is not worth spending thousands of dollars to learn.  It's not worth spending anything to learn.  The kid is going to come out whatever it's going to come out.  What does learning it 4 months earlier do for you exactly?  Like I get finding out the gender in the general course of your healthcare, you get an ultrasound and there's information there, get it.   But making that a specific goal?  For what?  I don't get gender reveal parties in general.  I literally do not comprehend why that's a thing that gets a party.  It's information.  I get it's a celebration, but WHY is that particular bit of information celebrated?  If you found out your babies eye color before birth would anyone throw a \"Eye Color reveal party\"?!  The whole concept is strange to me.  So yeah, it's not the distance exactly, it's that I find the whole idea absurd to begin with and the idea of spending massive amounts of money on this is to me like someone spending 100,000 on a purse.  Like if that's your thing, do it absolutely, if you can afford it, DO IT, if that's your jam.  But I find it ... just bizarre.  And I would totally mock my friends for it.  But they know my feelings on these things, and know that while i will happily attend your gender reveal party, I think you're a little cracked in the head.    But I feel that way about a lot of things that people do that baffle me, from Gender Reveals to 100k purses, to paying ridiculous amounts of money for a mutt, when there are hundreds in the pound, but you'll spend 4 grand on a mutt because someone said it was a WhateverTF-doodle.   It's just a mutt! If you breed a labrador to a poodle it's a mutt!  And you are paying huge dollars for it.  Anyway.  The peoples baffle me, but I pet their cute dogs, and admire their dumb purses and, go to their \"My child has GENITALIA\" parties.
