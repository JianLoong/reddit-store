{"id": 26726, "submission_id": "16gppun", "title": "AITA for not caring about my parents\u2019 divorce?", "selftext": "I (27F) had a difficult childhood. Not because my parents didn\u2019t love me, they did. They just raised me and my sister (32F) in quite an isolated way I guess.\n\nWe lived rurally and school was about 10 miles away. There was no public transport where we grew up and none of our friends lived walking distance so if we wanted to socialize, our parents had to drive us. But they were so scared of something bad happening to us they never let us out of their sight. As an example, when I was 14 I wanted to meet a friend (in the middle of the day) at the local park which was across the road from our house. My dad said no, too dangerous.\n\nThere was a lot of other stuff too that I won\u2019t go into. My parents weren\u2019t particularly liked by my friends\u2019 parents so my friends were rarely allowed to come to my house, and I was never allowed to be supervised by anyone but my parents or school teachers. So I spent most of my childhood/adolescence alone (my sister moved out when I was 13) in my room doing nothing outside of school. It was a really lonely existence to be honest. And hard - because I\u2019m a very social person.\n\nI moved out of state to college when I was 18 and never really looked back. I talk to my parents regularly enough but I\u2019ll only see them a couple of times a year. I don\u2019t really share any details of my life with them and we never talk about anything above surface level, which has worked great until recently\u2026 \n\nMy parents are currently going through a divorce. They are both going through a hard time and, my dad in particular, is feeling very lonely. They have been trying to rely on me for emotional support.\n\nThis is where I may be the AH. Every time I speak to either of them they are hyper emotional, laying stuff on me I can\u2019t take, and I hang up. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t talk about their marriage with either of them, and to be honest it\u2019s brought back childhood memories I\u2019d long suppressed. I can\u2019t get into the emotional stuff with my parents without suffering emotionally myself.\n\nMy dad and sister think I\u2019m an AH for refusing to talk about their divorce. To me\u2026 I\u2019m happiest when I keep a pretty professional level relationship with them. Emotional stuff with them is too heavy for me and we\u2019ve never had that relationship. I don\u2019t want to start now just because they\u2019re divorcing. \n\nAITA for avoiding my parents/not caring about their divorce?\n\nETA: what I\u2019m trying to express (and what links the childhood context to the current situation) is that it\u2019s hard for me that my parents were okay for me to be lonely growing up, but are now not okay to be lonely themselves. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s been resurfacing for me through all this, and why I\u2019m finding it hard to be there for them.", "created_utc": 1694520609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16gppun/aita_for_not_caring_about_my_parents_divorce/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She knows what it\u2019s like to grow up with your folks and being so isolated at home with no friends. At least she had your companionship for the most crucial time during adolescence.

Stand your ground and don't let them suck you into their emotional bullshit.  You deserve to be happy.  It is unfair for them to dump their emotional baggage on you.  My mom used to do this to me for year regarding my late addict brother.

Leaving aside that you were lonely/isolated, and now they are feeling that way, it\u2019s inappropriate for them to discuss their feelings about the divorce with you. Their relationship created you, you will still have a relationship with each of them after their relationship is over. They can talk to their friends/other relatives/pastor/therapist about this- but not their children. That\u2019s out of bounds.", "NTA. They deliberately and purposefully isolated you and your sister to the point that many people would be unable to cope in the real world or would develop unhealthy coping mechanisms. They trapped you at home with them until you could legally leave. That\u2019s a huge deal and now, when you\u2019ve escaped and made your own life, they now want you to comfort them because they are lonely after deliberately making their world small and isolated. Tough.\n\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not appropriate for a child, even an adult child, to mediate their parents divorce. If you want something to tell your parents I suggest something like this: \n\n\n\u201cMum/ Dad, I am your daughter equally and I can\u2019t be in the middle of your relationship. I do not want to hear intimate or personal details or how you feel about each other now. I cannot be your therapist and it\u2019s not appropriate for me to be. I am not picking sides or being accused of supporting one over the other or listening to one of you bad mouth the other. It hurts me and makes me deeply uncomfortable therefore I refuse to be subjected to it. That\u2019s why I hang up. I suggest speaking to your own friends (*if they have any*) or finding a therapist who is qualified to help you. I spent my entire childhood alone because you refused to let me go even across the street and rejected every friend I made. I can\u2019t help you now that you finally feel lonely because of your own actions, I\u2019m still dealing with what your isolation did to me. Please do not tell me details like this, I will continue to hang up every time. This is my boundary,respect it.\u201d \n\n\nAnd when they inevitably don\u2019t, because they finally feel lonely and have no friends to turn to, hang up, block them temporarily and keep living your best social life because you deserve it. I\u2019m sorry you were so alone. What your parents did counts as child abuse, they are lucky you even contact them.", "NTA you're a grown woman with your own life to live now. They can get therapists if they are struggling.", "NTA.  You should not ever have to deal with the emotional baggage from your parents' marriage falling apart.  That's too much to place on a child who will have loyalty in both directions.  It's very reasonable for you to tell both your parents \"Hey, I'm happy to speak to you on the phone, but I absolutely do not want to hear details about your divorce.  That's what a therapist is for.\"", "NTA\n\nPoor suggestion: put them on speaker phone while you do something else and artificially limit conversation to 10 minutes.\n\"hey sorry i was just heading out the door, but i have a few minutes\" set timer for 8 minutes\n\"oh wow\" \"damn how could they do that\" \"truly cruel\" \"are you sure they meant it like that?\" \"what did your therapist say about that\" \"alright i'm gonna let you go. love you bye\"", "My sister\u2019s BF is in this exact situation. This is how my dad explained it: A parent should never seek emotional support in their child. YOU are the child, they are meant to care for you. You should not be parenting them, it is not on you to parent them, and it is ridiculous of them to expect their CHILD to hold on to their emotional baggage", "NTA but I recommend seeing a personal therapist to handle all the stuff this is dredging up. You should recommend they see one too.", "NTA\n\nYou're being treated like an emotional support animal instead of a human being. You're not a pet that's supposed to love and agree with and listen to them no matter what. You're a human being that is equal to them and deserve the same treatment and consideration that they'd expect.\n\nMost importantly, you're their child. They should know that it's not your place to be their therapist. They should know that making you responsible for their emotional state is abusive.\n\nYou're an adult. It isn't unreasonable for you to ask your parents not to mention the divorce to you. If they can't respect that, then they don't respect you. If they don't respect you, then they don't deserve you.\n\nI suggest reiterating your point one more time and then putting them on time out. If they mention it on a phone call, hang up and don't call for a few days. If they text you about it, mute their notifications. They either don't talk about it or don't talk at all.", "Thank you so much. I think you\u2019ve managed to articulate how I feel/tie the pieces of my story together. I was trying to express that it\u2019s been hard for me that they were okay with me being lonely growing up, but are now not okay to be lonely themselves. That\u2019s what\u2019s been resurfacing for me. I appreciate this response.", "Thank you so much for this. That\u2019s exactly how I feel - I want to be their child, not their friend. No matter how old I am\u2026 they were always so intent on protecting me from the world and I guess I feel now like I need them to protect me from their divorce in a way. Thanks for taking the time to reply, I feel really validated.", "I\u2019m an adult child whose parents divorced after 25+ years of marriage.  Like you, I was forced into the position of being a therapist to these two people and it was a burden I was unwilling to take.  I had to set boundaries with them and it pissed them both off.  I\u2019m pretty sure I was called some names.  Too damn bad.  I needed to protect my own mental health.  I was dealing with my own emotional upheaval their divorce caused, as their adult child.  I did not need to hear about their issues.   \n\nAlthough our background stories are very different, I completely get where you are coming from.  It is not up to you to be a sounding board for parents who were emotionally unavailable to you.  It\u2019s unfair for them to think you are somehow obligated to listen.  Your dad and sister are the AH.  You are NTA and your reactions are similar to mine when I went through my parent\u2019s divorce.  It is your coping mechanism.  You are fine.", "All this! \n\nSister didn't even have it as bad as OP. Maybe before OP was born. But once OP was born, sis had someone there. Might not have been the right age as her friends would have been but at least OP was there. OP had no one after the sister left. From growing up with someone and sharing in that isolation and then losing that for like 5 years.\n\nNTA, OP.", "Thank you. I really needed this.", "This is so interesting, thank you for sharing. I rarely hear of anyone else who grew up like this. It is hard when they want to be part of your adult life but never made a space for you to feel comfortable in their presence.", "Thank you for sharing! Navigating that fine line is so hard. I\u2019ll stay firm on my boundaries.", "Op, this is a great suggestion and a useful book", "NTA tell them to go to a therapist", "They\u2019re treating you like their emotional support animal and that is not right.  Keep up the grey rocking and your boundaries, and cut down on the contact for awhile if need be.", "Thank you for this! How WEIRD is dealing with your parents divorce as an adult. It\u2019s not something you really anticipate in adulthood. I feel much better knowing others have coped similarly by not engaging with it. I really appreciate this.", "OP, you're NTA and you're not protecting yourself from their divorce but from their toxicity.\n\nIf they want and need it so bad next time tell them you're NOT their therapist and they should find one to talk about everything they want, you're not part of their relationship or divorce. Maybe your father needs a pet to feel less lonely, so you can suggest that. \n\nAnd tell your sister to STFU, she left when you were 13y.o, she knows nothing about the things you went through for years until you could get out of there, moreover she has NO right to dictate how you feel, if she wants to be your parents free therapist that's her choice.\n\nAlways always always prioritize your emotional and mental health, even if it means to put distance and boundaries to others who don't respect you.", "Exactly!", "And OP should get one for themselve as well...", "It is weird.  We are put into the position of seeing our parents as human beings separate from their role of mom and dad.  It\u2019s surreal.  \n\nAs people are living longer lives, many older folks are thinking \u201cI don\u2019t need to be miserable for another 20+ years\u201d. \n\nYou may discover that after some time you actually like who your parents are as individuals, not as a unit.  My mom was a miserable person as my father\u2019s wife.  She is so much nicer now and actually funny.  My dad on the other hand is a jerk, to put it politely.  But he was the \u201cfun one\u201d in his own misogynistic way growing up.  I see things with more clarity and in a way it has freed me from the boundaries my parents set for me while growing up.", "Wouldn't hurt for op to have the help of a good therapist but this was for the parents to dump emotional baggage instead of on op.", "Wow that\u2019s fascinating! A friend of mine who\u2019s parents separated a couple of years before mine did has had a similar experience. She said she\u2019s actually closer to them now because they\u2019re better people apart. I would love that to be true of my parents, and really do hope they find happiness in their individuality. Thanks again for sharing."]}
