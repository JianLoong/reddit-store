I will be going to college at the start of next year. My bio dad very rarely pays child support for me and my sister, and the little he does contribute would not have been enough to feed us for even a week, with both my mum's and his income. Luckily my sister and I were very fortunate to have been raised by not only my mum, but my stepdad, grandmothers, uncles and aunties. Of course he doesn't need to pay anymore child support for me ever since I turned 18, I just want to emphasise how much he's NOT supported me throughout my life. He also lives a 3hr flight away from us. I have not seen him in person for 4 years.\n\nThe one thing he has consistently paid for since I was about 16 was my Spotify Premium (and also Youtube Premium since he had some sort of combo deal of the two but I've not been notified of Youtube Premium being cancelled). It was part of a family subscription that he paid for and had me, his partner and a few other non-family on it.\n\nA week ago, I got an email saying that the subscription had been cancelled, so I only have the free version now. It's not the costs that bug me, as I said I work part-time so I can pay for my own, though my stepdad said he wants to pay for it (bless him. Not that this matters too much but I actually call my stepdad dad, and refer to my bio dad by his first name. I have not yet called my bio dad his first name to his face since we very rarely talk). What upsets me is that it was cancelled with no warning from him, it was the only thing that he consistently paid for me.\n\nOn the other hand, he's flying to our hometown (which is about an 1\u00bd hour flight away from where I live) at the end of November. He just paid for half of my flight to meet him there, as well as see my paternal grandma, uncle and aunty who just had a baby. He paid for the flight the day before I got the email, so I don't want to be entitled by bringing up the spotify thing.

It is not surprising that you would feel a sting at him ending the one tiny little thing he DOES do for you.\n\nThat being said, based on your description of him as a parent, I doubt you factored into his decision at all.  He just decided HE doesn't use Spotify any more, so ended his subscription.  Didn't consider you into the equation at all.\n\nI think it is fine to bring it up.  Honestly, it would be fine for you to say it hurt your feelings, as there are so few miniscule ties between you.  But if you are uncomfortable doing that, then bring up the question casually about HIS account, not about YOUR account.  Because guaranteed that is how he sees it.  Just a simple \"Oh hey, I got a notice that you cancelled your Spotify account.  What happened?\"", "NTA, but I think you may be better off just distancing yoursef from him. It sounds like he doesn't feel any obligation toward you. Granted, I don't see a Spotify account as an obligatiom, but when combined with his lack of support? He just doesn't seem like a father.", "Personally, I wouldn\u2019t bring it up. It would just come off as petty and entitled.", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t bring it up, it would come across as petty. I get why you\u2019re annoyed but it isn\u2019t worth it", "Sounds like your father doesn't really make a lot of money. If that's the case, could the premium account be cancelled so her can afford the full flight for him and half for you?\n\nYou can bring it up, just be careful how you word it. I wouldn't be like why did you cancel my account cause 1, it's not your account and 2, seems kind of shallow. More like I got an email about the Spotify premium, is everything ok?", "It could be something simple like his payment method expired. You are NTA for asking if he plans to keep paying for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
