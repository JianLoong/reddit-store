He even does it a few weekday nights. I obviously take care of our small kid by myself during these times. \n\nI routinely take our kid to do activities together and play with our friends, during which he has alone time and does his hobbies. I also know his hobbies are important and I want to be supportive so I proactively give him time for that.\n\nHe mostly does not take our kid anywhere alone or with her friends (he\u2019s not social). He pretty much only does it when I specifically ask for alone time payback.\n\nHistorically, he has taken much more free time than me. Basically because he has hobbies he can see and I would spend my free time reading, crafting, playing video games, doing self care, etc, he historically hasn\u2019t seen my \u201chobbies\u201d as equal to his. His activities are really rigorous, somewhat expensive, equipment heavy sports.\n\nI had our kid by myself nearly all day yesterday and he asked for more this morning and finally put my foot down. I said no insisted that he start *offering* to take our kid the next day or soon after he has lots of free time as a way to show he recognizes and appreciates my effort. \n\nHe insists I *just need to ask* and I\u2019m being ridiculous. I say the difference is my partner showing *proactive appreciation* for my time versus passive appreciation. The offering and awareness part is important to me.\n\nI honestly am resentful of his attitude towards my time and am asking for the thing I need to not be resentful anymore. I feel like he needs to be a little more self and situationally aware and realize he\u2019s somewhat in my debt. He\u2019s gotten his hobby time at the expense of my time for years. \n\nHe says I\u2019m the AH because I just need to ask and he shouldn\u2019t have to guess. I say he\u2019s the AH because there\u2019s no guessing. Just offer to take the kid the next day or next weekend, the same as you would offer to pay someone back for money you owe them.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR husband does his hobbies for hours and sometimes full days at a time, leaving me alone with our small kid and doesn\u2019t offer to give me the same free time back in return.

This isn't really about whether he offers you free time.  This is about his role in parenting your and his kid.  How much time is he spending with the kid?  How much time are you spending as a family?  What will it mean to the kid if Dad was a no show most of every weekend and sometimes days at a time on a hobby?  18 years goes by in a blink.  The two of you need to work together and fix this now, with couples counseling if necessary.", "NTA it sounds like you cater to his hobbies without many complaints, and just want some free time for yourself like he gets to have. You definitely shouldn\u2019t have to ask, though one could argue that asking every once in a while could also remedy the situation. I\u2019d say you both need to start being vocal about you needing free time, just to help the situation.", "NTA. I don't think it's asking too much for him to show he wants to be an active parent here. I understand that he can't read your mind but basic logic should apply.", "NTA, you guys are meant to be a team as parents. That includes making sure that you each get quality self care time, because burn out is a real thing. And I'd also go further in pointing out your hubby is a double a-hole - solo time with kiddo will strengthen their bond, and can only be a good thing. He shouldn't need to be *asked* to take the reins, you know?", "NTA. He is supposed to be a partner. You are telling him that you need more time to yourself, and you expect him to be aware of the time imbalance in the relationship. \n\nHe needs to take more time with his kids anyway, as he is their parent just as much as you. You shouldn't have to request he schedule time with the kid as if you're his secretary.", "NTA. It's understandable that you feel resentful when your husband takes extensive free time for his hobbies without offering you the same in return. Requesting him to proactively recognize and appreciate your efforts is reasonable. Open communication and finding a compromise that balances both your needs can help resolve this issue.", "NTA. \n\nYou *have to ask* your husband to spend one on one time with his kid? Yikes.", "NTA. Awareness that the kids need to be cared for is part of the emotional labor that women end up taking on out of necessity. You\u2019re asking him to be thoughtful and considerate, and to put some effort into considering your needs and situation. \n\nBut it sounds like that\u2019s not in the cards for him, so maybe just tell him \u201cI\u2019m taking the day tomorrow\u201d and make him figure it out?", "You husband sounds a bit selfish with his hobby and needs to be considerate about how much time he spends away from the family.  (This is why I don\u2019t golf as much anymore)\n\nHowever you need to be more proactive and say, \u201cI would like to do X for Y hours on Sunday, can you watch the kiddo?\u201d  Some men like direct communication like this.\n\nMy solution is for both of you to schedule your free time in advance that way everyone is in the loop.  It should be relatively equal as well. \n\nNTA, but try to work this out before it becomes too much of a problem down the road.", "You're martyr-ing yourself. Book something in or tell him you're going upstairs to read, he's on duty. Communicate instead of letting it fester. I did exactly the same, so I do get it, but you can't expect him to be a mind reader. Assert yourself and tell him you're taking some time. If he still doesn't step up, THEN you have a problem.", "NTAH  partner means shared responsibilities.  Does he go to work and do nothing until someone asks him to do his job?  Willful ignorance is not being a partner.", "NTA, and you ARE asking anyway. You\u2019re asking that he start to proactively plan to take the kid after he\u2019s spent time on his hobby. This isn\u2019t you secretly expecting a thing he can\u2019t possibly anticipate. You asked. YW maybe be TA if you just seethed in resentment and blow up maybe (well probably E S H because he sounds semi negligent) but you didn\u2019t do that at all. You presented a need clearly.", "NTA - you need time too and not a little, as much as he gets! He likely needs to cut back on his hobbies but tough shit.", "NTA for how you feel. Definitely a communication issue here. Does he seem to understand you want him to make the offer? Some people don\u2019t get that. \nHim making the offer is saying, \u201c Your hobbies are valuable and you need your time\u201d. If he doesn\u2019t think like this, it may be hard for him to get. \nHe sees his hobbies as more valuable because of the money involved in them, yes? I am not understanding why he doesn\u2019t see being around your child as a fun time for him and the child?", "INFO: does he have to ask you for time to do his hobbies? Or do you typically plan for his time off without him needing to ask you?", "NTA. It will probably be easier for everyone if you both schedule your time in advance though. You shouldn't have to ask, it should just be assumed that you both get equal time to yourself.", "NTAH. Honestly, I get it. He doesn\u2019t have to ask for time. He just goes and does whatever. I\u2019d start keeping a calendar for every single day. You are basically a single parent. That\u2019s what you are.  And he\u2019s ok with this arraignment.", "NTA.  He needs to be actively parenting his kid and you aren't his manager.", "[deleted]", "ESH. Your husband is being a selfish asshole and you're being a passive aggressive asshole primarily to yourself.\n\nPlan your life and give him a schedule of when he's expected to take care of your child alone. But ultimately, your husband is prioritizing his hobby over his family and you'll do yourself a favor by jettisoning him and starting a new life without him.", "ESH\n\nYou're both way to into weighing this vs. that and expecting perfect 1:1 exchanges, WHICH WILL NEVER HAPPEN.\n\nMy husband and I just went through a similar argument. He golfs every Saturday, I was always annoyed because I don't get 4 hours to myself every weekend...but I never just took it! \n\nSo now, Saturday mornings are golf, Sunday mornings are mine. Sometimes I sleep until 11, go to the gym, meet up with friends. We're both flexible as needed to accommodate events, family time, etc.\n\nCould he offer? Sure. But you can also define and set some boundaries.", "ESH\n\nYou both need to be more proactive.  You are passively resenting him, and he is passively taking advantage.\n\nYou need to sit down together and hash out a schedule that is better balanced and has ypu both as active parents in your child's life.", "Yta. Use your words.", "ESH. He sounds selfish for just how much time he spends away from the family but as far as you getting alone time - that\u2019s your responsibility, not his. I\u2019m saying this as a previously resentful SAHM. You absolutely deserve your time but it\u2019s not incumbent upon him to plan it for you. I would suggest you suggest to him and arrangement where he can take Saturday and you can take Sunday. Or you literally just make plans for yourself every Sunday and let him know ahead of time you\u2019ll be gone.", "[deleted]", "ESH - you are asking him to be a mind reader but he needs to understand his hobbies don't trump childcare. My husband has hobbies (Warhammer 40k mostly) but we have conversations before he takes time for games.", "YTA for demanding he offer.  You are a sentient adult, make your own plans without her (as he does), tell him you are leaving and go.  \n\nYou have a valid gripe of getting less personal time and being the default parent (like most mothers) but you are losing the thread by demanding that he take responsibility for your downtime.", "NAH. \n\nI understand it's taxing to constantly have to ask or remind someone for things that you feel they should already know to give you. I am friends with quite a few \"forgetful\" people and as the overthinker and planner I sometimes wish someone would do the same for me. \n\nBut on the other hand, I know that when people forget, it isn't because they hate me or they don't want to help me, it's just that they NEED the reminder. I can either decide to be upset that they need this and leave or I stay and accommodate them. \n\nThings like birthdays, appointments, holidays, that require advanced planning and can have a reminder set, that's an easy fix. My partner keeps a note of things that matter to me, because he knows he'd forget otherwise. But in your case, it may be worth the effort to make this solution a collaborative one rather than adversarial. If you go with the latter, one of you will come away at least slightly unhappier with the other.

Sit down, start from scratch, pencil out how much personal time you both should get and what is expected of you afterwards. I expect the underlying problem is that you didn't start from an even place - you started from a place where you are the default and he doesn't even feel like he needs to ask. He makes plans and then lets you know, and if you both did that as often as he does, there would be conflicts, someone would have to cancel, and you would fight. He is happy with the way it is now and you are sacrificing to keep the peace. If you win and he agrees to offer you personal time, will that fix the problem? Or will you still feel like he's in control of the schedule and he gets time whenever he wants it while you only get time when it's necessary to pay you back?", "Tell him he has primary care of his kiddo on the weekends for the next few months.

He needs to do an equal share, even if he does things at home with her. Even if it\u2019s something simple like a trip to the park for a few hours. And self care, reading, etc, are real hobbies. It\u2019s ridiculous to have to ask for an equal share of free time. Both parents need alone time.", "Yeah. It sounds like he's doing that thing that so many men do, where they just settle into being \"Parent B\". Him offering to look after his kid isn't just about his wife not having to ask*, but is also about his relationship with his chold. He should want to spend time with his child. It's good for their relationship. If she always has to ask, it means he's not developing a relationship for his child's sake, and is basically just a glorified and condescending babysitter.\n\n*I totally get why she's upset by that. It's demeaning to both of you when you need to repeatedly ask an adult to fulfil their responsibilities. Should she also have to ask him to do any amount of housework? Or is he a grown -ass adult who should be expected to recognise that he should do it by himself. Looking after his child is one of his adult responsibilities, and he *should* do it at least sometimes without needing to be asked like it's some kind of favour to his wife.", "I wish I knew how to tag OP, she needs to read this comment!!", "Yeah, hobbies can be good for people, but family should come first.

No he just assumed she will and that's the real issue here.

She is as much responsible for that as he is. She's allowed it while simmering in resentment, waiting for him to figure it out. How can he know? I do get the frustration of feeling that it should be obvious, I've been there myself with my husband, but you can't control how he thinks or acts, you can only control your own actions. So tell him. I'm going out at X time, bye. I'm going for a bath, I don't want to be disturbed for X hours, bye. Don't get trapped in that victim mentality. It's miserable. And if he doesn't step up - bin him. It's such a relief to let go of that resentment!", "It kind of bothers me why he sees time with his child as about YOU, rather than about spending time with his child.

Of course she\u2019s resentful! He\u2019s not stepping up with the attitude change when asked AND getting mad about being told to change his attitude and behavior.

Part of this issue is him not intuitively knowing what you need and you not advocating for yourself.
