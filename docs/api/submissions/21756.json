He even does it a few weekday nights. I obviously take care of our small kid by myself during these times. \n\nI routinely take our kid to do activities together and play with our friends, during which he has alone time and does his hobbies. I also know his hobbies are important and I want to be supportive so I proactively give him time for that.\n\nHe mostly does not take our kid anywhere alone or with her friends (he\u2019s not social). He pretty much only does it when I specifically ask for alone time payback.\n\nHistorically, he has taken much more free time than me. Basically because he has hobbies he can see and I would spend my free time reading, crafting, playing video games, doing self care, etc, he historically hasn\u2019t seen my \u201chobbies\u201d as equal to his. His activities are really rigorous, somewhat expensive, equipment heavy sports.\n\nI had our kid by myself nearly all day yesterday and he asked for more this morning and finally put my foot down. I said no insisted that he start *offering* to take our kid the next day or soon after he has lots of free time as a way to show he recognizes and appreciates my effort. \n\nHe insists I *just need to ask* and I\u2019m being ridiculous. I say the difference is my partner showing *proactive appreciation* for my time versus passive appreciation. The offering and awareness part is important to me.\n\nI honestly am resentful of his attitude towards my time and am asking for the thing I need to not be resentful anymore. I feel like he needs to be a little more self and situationally aware and realize he\u2019s somewhat in my debt. He\u2019s gotten his hobby time at the expense of my time for years. \n\nHe says I\u2019m the AH because I just need to ask and he shouldn\u2019t have to guess.

This isn't really about whether he offers you free time.  This is about his role in parenting your and his kid.  How much time is he spending with the kid?  How much time are you spending as a family?  What will it mean to the kid if Dad was a no show most of every weekend and sometimes days at a time on a hobby?  18 years goes by in a blink.  The two of you need to work together and fix this now, with couples counseling if necessary.", "NTA it sounds like you cater to his hobbies without many complaints, and just want some free time for yourself like he gets to have. You definitely shouldn\u2019t have to ask, though one could argue that asking every once in a while could also remedy the situation. I\u2019d say you both need to start being vocal about you needing free time, just to help the situation.", "NTA. I don't think it's asking too much for him to show he wants to be an active parent here. I understand that he can't read your mind but basic logic should apply.", "NTA, you guys are meant to be a team as parents. That includes making sure that you each get quality self care time, because burn out is a real thing. And I'd also go further in pointing out your hubby is a double a-hole - solo time with kiddo will strengthen their bond, and can only be a good thing. He shouldn't need to be *asked* to take the reins, you know?", "NTA. He is supposed to be a partner. You are telling him that you need more time to yourself, and you expect him to be aware of the time imbalance in the relationship. \n\nHe needs to take more time with his kids anyway, as he is their parent just as much as you. You shouldn't have to request he schedule time with the kid as if you're his secretary.", "NTA. It's understandable that you feel resentful when your husband takes extensive free time for his hobbies without offering you the same in return. Requesting him to proactively recognize and appreciate your efforts is reasonable. Open communication and finding a compromise that balances both your needs can help resolve this issue.", "NTA. \n\nYou *have to ask* your husband to spend one on one time with his kid? Yikes.", "NTA. Awareness that the kids need to be cared for is part of the emotional labor that women end up taking on out of necessity. You\u2019re asking him to be thoughtful and considerate, and to put some effort into considering your needs and situation. \n\nBut it sounds like that\u2019s not in the cards for him, so maybe just tell him \u201cI\u2019m taking the day tomorrow\u201d and make him figure it out?", "You husband sounds a bit selfish with his hobby and needs to be considerate about how much time he spends away from the family.

It should be relatively equal as well. \n\nNTA, but try to work this out before it becomes too much of a problem down the road.\n\nEdit:  To clarify, he should be asking too.  I\u2019m not excusing him for bolting on a whim and leaving her with the kids", "You're martyr-ing yourself. Book something in or tell him you're going upstairs to read, he's on duty.

If he still doesn't step up, THEN you have a problem.", "NTAH  partner means shared responsibilities.  Does he go to work and do nothing until someone asks him to do his job?  Willful ignorance is not being a partner.", "NTA, and you ARE asking anyway. You\u2019re asking that he start to proactively plan to take the kid after he\u2019s spent time on his hobby. This isn\u2019t you secretly expecting a thing he can\u2019t possibly anticipate. You asked. YW maybe be TA if you just seethed in resentment and blow up maybe (well probably E S H because he sounds semi negligent) but you didn\u2019t do that at all. You presented a need clearly.", "NTA - you need time too and not a little, as much as he gets! He likely needs to cut back on his hobbies but tough shit.", "NTA for how you feel. Definitely a communication issue here. Does he seem to understand you want him to make the offer? Some people don\u2019t get that. \nHim making the offer is saying, \u201c Your hobbies are valuable and you need your time\u201d. If he doesn\u2019t think like this, it may be hard for him to get. \nHe sees his hobbies as more valuable because of the money involved in them, yes? I am not understanding why he doesn\u2019t see being around your child as a fun time for him and the child?", "INFO: does he have to ask you for time to do his hobbies? Or do you typically plan for his time off without him needing to ask you?", "NTA. It will probably be easier for everyone if you both schedule your time in advance though. You shouldn't have to ask, it should just be assumed that you both get equal time to yourself.", "NTAH. Honestly, I get it. He doesn\u2019t have to ask for time. He just goes and does whatever. I\u2019d start keeping a calendar for every single day. You are basically a single parent. That\u2019s what you are.  And he\u2019s ok with this arraignment.", "NTA.  He needs to be actively parenting his kid and you aren't his manager.", "[deleted]", "ESH. Your husband is being a selfish asshole and you're being a passive aggressive asshole primarily to yourself.\n\nPlan your life and give him a schedule of when he's expected to take care of your child alone.

He golfs every Saturday, I was always annoyed because I don't get 4 hours to myself every weekend...but I never just took it! \n\nSo now, Saturday mornings are golf, Sunday mornings are mine. Sometimes I sleep until 11, go to the gym, meet up with friends. We're both flexible as needed to accommodate events, family time, etc.\n\nCould he offer? Sure. But you can also define and set some boundaries.", "ESH\n\nYou both need to be more proactive.  You are passively resenting him, and he is passively taking advantage.\n\nYou need to sit down together and hash out a schedule that is better balanced and has ypu both as active parents in your child's life.", "Yta. Use your words.", "ESH. He sounds selfish for just how much time he spends away from the family but as far as you getting alone time - that\u2019s your responsibility, not his. I\u2019m saying this as a previously resentful SAHM. You absolutely deserve your time but it\u2019s not incumbent upon him to plan it for you. I would suggest you suggest to him and arrangement where he can take Saturday and you can take Sunday. Or you literally just make plans for yourself every Sunday and let him know ahead of time you\u2019ll be gone.", "[deleted]", "ESH - you are asking him to be a mind reader but he needs to understand his hobbies don't trump childcare. My husband has hobbies (Warhammer 40k mostly) but we have conversations before he takes time for games.", "YTA for demanding he offer.  You are a sentient adult, make your own plans without her (as he does), tell him you are leaving and go.  \n\nYou have a valid gripe of getting less personal time and being the default parent (like most mothers) but you are losing the thread by demanding that he take responsibility for your downtime.", "NAH. \n\nI understand it's taxing to constantly have to ask or remind someone for things that you feel they should already know to give you. I am friends with quite a few \"forgetful\" people and as the overthinker and planner I sometimes wish someone would do the same for me. \n\nBut on the other hand, I know that when people forget, it isn't because they hate me or they don't want to help me, it's just that they NEED the reminder. I can either decide to be upset that they need this and leave or I stay and accommodate them. \n\nThings like birthdays, appointments, holidays, that require advanced planning and can have a reminder set, that's an easy fix. My partner keeps a note of things that matter to me, because he knows he'd forget otherwise. But in your case, it may be worth the effort to make this solution a collaborative one rather than adversarial. If you go with the latter, one of you will come away at least slightly unhappier with the other.

I expect the underlying problem is that you didn't start from an even place - you started from a place where you are the default and he doesn't even feel like he needs to ask. He makes plans and then lets you know, and if you both did that as often as he does, there would be conflicts, someone would have to cancel, and you would fight. He is happy with the way it is now and you are sacrificing to keep the peace. If you win and he agrees to offer you personal time, will that fix the problem?

It\u2019s ridiculous to have to ask for an equal share of free time. Both parents need alone time.", "Yeah. It sounds like he's doing that thing that so many men do, where they just settle into being \"Parent B\". Him offering to look after his kid isn't just about his wife not having to ask*, but is also about his relationship with his chold. He should want to spend time with his child.

If she always has to ask, it means he's not developing a relationship for his child's sake, and is basically just a glorified and condescending babysitter.\n\n*I totally get why she's upset by that. It's demeaning to both of you when you need to repeatedly ask an adult to fulfil their responsibilities. Should she also have to ask him to do any amount of housework?

She is as much responsible for that as he is. She's allowed it while simmering in resentment, waiting for him to figure it out. How can he know? I do get the frustration of feeling that it should be obvious, I've been there myself with my husband, but you can't control how he thinks or acts, you can only control your own actions. So tell him. I'm going out at X time, bye. I'm going for a bath, I don't want to be disturbed for X hours, bye. Don't get trapped in that victim mentality. It's miserable. And if he doesn't step up - bin him.

Have you tried acting like him, where you just assume that he will watch her when you make plans for yourself?\n\nI really don't think your need for him to offer is reasonable. He doesn't wait for you to offer, why would you wait for him to offer? You need to be more proactive and assertive in prioritizing yourself. He has hobbies and makes plans for them. You need to do the same. The correct reciprocation is not that then he offers you time for hobbies, because that is acting like time for hobbies is something that he alone controls. Real reciprocation is you scheduling time for your hobbies without needing him to offer or getting his permission. \n\nYou guys might also sit down and look at the calendar and schedule time for hobbies together, so you each have free time blocked off.", "YTA\n\nIf you have a need, communicate. That need isnt him randomly offering. That would be nice but it isnt helpful. What if you dont want time where hes offering? Then its just a pointless exercise. Plan something.

And being a team is one of our greatest strengths. Usually Friday night we would talk about what our weekend goals/plans were, what the priorities were and how together we could make it happen. For example, if you give me a chance to repair the fence from 8-12, I can take the kids to the park from 1-5 so you can finish your project.

I totally hear you and you deserve a husband that when you say \u201cwow I\u2019m tired\u201d says \u201coh honey I\u2019ll make lunch for us, why don\u2019t you go rest\u201d from time to time but at the same time you\u2019re asking your husband to prioritize you when you aren\u2019t doing that first. \n\nBeat him to the punch, don\u2019t expect reciprocation once you\u2019ve given him time- schedule your time regardless. It doesn\u2019t matter what the hell you\u2019re using that time for you deserve a break. I will also agree it sounds like your husband doesn\u2019t participate in this family or raising your child as much as you do and that seems to be a problem. \n\nI promise you a once a week meeting with your calendars to go over weekly goals, expectations, appts, bandwidth, how you\u2019re each doing emotionally- hugely hugely helpful.

It\u2019s not difficult to plan activities for children, especially for your own children that you (presumably) know what they can/can\u2019t do, like/don\u2019t like, etc. Your husband is perfectly capable of taking the initiative to plan activities with your daughter, he just doesn\u2019t want to.

Framing is just a more assertive way of communicating a point - something every relationship sometimes needs. \n\nDue to circumstances, that\u2019s the situation they find themselves in - husband egregiously liberal with his responsibilities, and OP not yet assertive enough on this specific situation for anything to change.\n\nIf it\u2019s as bad as OP suggests, I think is important to set a new standard of fairness but not without showing the thought. Framing cements and backs the standard with reason, logic, and shows that the thought was put in. \n\nIf OPs husband is acting in good faith and simply acting in a way he believes OP is fine with, he should respond amicably. Hopefully he\u2019ll feel guilty and immediately understand that you\u2019ve been struggling with this, and had to put in that effort to even just ask for fairness.  \n\nThat would kill me as a husband. \n\nI do not think this is the case. \n\nIf OPs husband is acting in bad faith and intentionally abusing the power dynamic in the relationship, the framing can break down tremendous pushback before it can even begin. \n\nI\u2019m inclined to believe this is the story. It\u2019s way too out of balance for it to be anything but.  And OP says it\u2019s been happening for years. \n\nSimply changing things \u2018should be reasonable\u2019 because after all you\u2019re only asking for fairness, but the situation itself is already very unreasonable, and desperate times call for desperate measures.  Years of behavior is difficult to just change, and people generally don\u2019t like to dramatically reduce their QoL.  Sometimes you have to sacrifice your time and energy for a need not of your own. You have to be present in order to be aware. \n\nIt\u2019s called being a parent. \n\nIf the situation weren\u2019t as skewed in his favor, I think you could approach it without any framing. I don\u2019t know where you draw the line on how good or bad it has to be for that to change. \n\nI\u2019ve been married almost 9 years and we have one child. We can tell each other we\u2019re going to go somewhere (\u2018I\u2019m going to yoga\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to toss a frisbee around with some friends\u2019), but we both still ask too.  Depending on the day, the mood, the weather, the family, everything happening at that time, we both reasonably make the call to ask vs tell.  It took time to reach this pleasant equilibrium, but effort must be maintained to preserve it.  Sometimes we bonk heads but that\u2019s okay. Bonking keeps things in check. \n\nGood luck to you OP, and thanks for coming to my TED talk.\n\nEdit: fucks sake. NTA. Also, I have a committed hobby too. Takes up one night per week.", "Right? Not asking for mind reading, just asking to be mindful and considerate.", "Which it doesn't sound like she's doing currently. He goes ahead and does what he wants. She should do the same. But I know it's hard when you're the primary carer for children. It's easy to slip into a routine where your partner assumes you'll watch the kids, and you end up feeling taken for granted. So I hope they're able to talk through it and understand eachother's point of view.", "I would agree with that if we were starting fresh. We\u2019re not. He\u2019s been taking liberties with my free time for years and he needs to help make a repair by showing my free time is important too.", ">It would be nice if her partner automatically thought \u201c I was out all day I should offer her time to herself\u201d but clearly that\u2019s not working.\n\nThis is the crux of the issue. A good partner should care about whether their partner is having all of their needs met. The fact that he isn\u2019t ever thinking about what she wants/needs is a problem.", "Yes and it cuts both ways. I don't know if my husband has had a shitty day at work and needs some quiet time when he gets home, or if he's having a particularly bad day with his back pain. Unless he tells me. I do check in and ask regularly, especially about his back, but sometimes he just blows up.\n\n\nI think the important thing is to not fall into the trap of being a victim. I want OP to see where her power is in this situation. She can't change her partner or control his actions, but she can act and advocate for herself. I think when one person is working and the other is at home with the children, neither has much insight into the other's day to day life and struggles. So communicate. Don't fester.", "It\u2019s not automatic at this point\u2014she\u2019s asked him to do exactly that. He could get into the habit of that, now that he knows to. He could set reminders etc. It sounds like he schedules his hobby. He could schedule something to take the kid out and do every time he schedules a hobby at a cadence, etc.", "But it would still be less of a hassle for you? And why can\u2019t he chip in to the schedule? Like he should be able to schedule his time on it, if he\u2019s a big boy.", "But why are you treating it as a tit for tat arrangement? Do you offer to take the kd during his hobby? Or day do you want me to take the kid so you can go do your hobby? Or does he just go do it. Why can't you do the same? Just say oh I have x planned on Saturday afternoon. I'll see you when I get back. Why are you waiting for him to say do you want to go do something alone on Saturday? You sound like you want some kind of minute for minute schedule where he was gone for 5 hours and 10 minutes.... so he should offer you 5 hours and 10 minutes in return. Or you could just say hey im going out see you later. Why are you making it so difficult?", "Just make plans and follow through.  Stop wanting him to ask you and just do it.  You're making it a bigger problem for yourself by not standing up for yourself better.  And hold him accountable with his lack of parenting.", "Not asking for mind reading, just asking to be mindful and considerate.", "This.

He can the adequately plan for his Saturday and Sunday in advance\u2026and you do the same - that way you start to have that ability to take her to things that she wants to do\u2026and you are not default doing it all", "nta! \nyou both should really have a look at laura dangers (thatdarnchat) tiktok-account!  you probably will find the words to bring this issue up.", "I'll rephrase, sorry. I meant that not everyone finds it a hardship to spend time with their children. But yes, everyone needs time away to be themselves. Unfortunately, I know many mothers who don't do that. They give up everything of themselves to parenting, and then the stress and resentment kicks in at some point down the line. \n\n\nShe must advocate for her free time. If I had to guess, I would say that this status quo has gone on for so long now, that OP wouldn't even know what she enjoys anymore. Not fully. I've seen far too many friends lose themselves to motherhood. I did it too. \n\n\nSo I hope they're able to communicate and find balance. I hope her partner takes on board that she needs him to be more proactive in some ways, but OP must seize her power and recognise what she can and can't control here. Issues like this are sadly too common in relationships once children come along, but they have the potential to tear the family apart if not dealt with. So I hope they fix it. Communication is key.", "Yep. Profound lack of awareness.", "Yea it sounds like OP need to be more proactive and offer to HIM for him to do more parenting lol", "She has told him: she needs him to proactively offer her free time and consider that day to day, look at and understand when the time is unbalanced or he\u2019s spending time on his hobby. And that makes him angry somehow! Idk why \u201ctelling him\u201d is being suggested since she DID tell him. What she needs is consistent effort and consideration though, not just an afternoon off.", "I know what I enjoy.

I'm so sorry you're being put through this, it's supremely unfair.", "That's your choice though. Advocate for yourself.
