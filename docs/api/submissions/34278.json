I only want one answer questioned, \"Where is all her money\" cause none of it adds up. \n\nShe is \"always working\" and that's why she can't visit or reply to me, but at the same time she is only working less than 20 hours a week. She also lives with my mom, where I do not, so whenever I ask any questions on \"why can't she get more hours,\" \"can't she get a second job\" \"what are her bills\" I never get a stright answer and told, \"you shouldn't be asking questions. Its rude.\" \n\nBy the way I work hard. Which it isn't like I have a massive income myself. I live okay, enough to pay bills, not starve, and once in a while buy something for myself. And this has been going on for almost a year now. Every time I ask about my sister working, I get blown off, I offer a position at my job cause they need people I get blown off. Every single time my mother and I get into an argument because she wants to bring up the only time I've needed help in life, reminding me how I could had been homeless. ( It was during the pendemic something out of my control they fired all of us.) That my life would be more of a struggle if I had kids and then I'll understand suffering. She hopes that when I have kids I struggle and understand how rude I am being refusing to help. Which I didn't refuse yet, I wanted to know how she can't pay her few bills.\n\nThis last time I broke, I couldn't keep quiet any more, i shouted, \"I will not help any more until my questions are answered. If she's too lazy to work, I shouldn't be paying her to sit around. The one time I needed help was during a pandemic. She's just being a lazy B*** wanting free handouts\" \nAfter that hung up blocking my mother's contact cause I am sick of the gaslighting, blackmailed, manipulating, whatever you want to call it I don't know. Now my sister has all the time to cuss me out saying how horrible I am, insulting me, and wishing I loose everything. Some family members are also siding with them. It's been a few weeks now and things have calmed down. To where my mom asked me for $100 cause my sister needs to pay a bill. I left her on read and I don't think I am going to send the money. \n\nSo am I the bad guy refusing to help my sister anymore? I honestly can't tell. I feel like my concerns are nothing to them. How I live or if I am struggling they don't care. It's only about my older sister. By the way my mom has retirement thats been doing good for her for a few years now. I did ask about that but I get blown off. She never answers if she's running out of money every month or whats going on. No questions get answered where I feel they are using me.

And your bank account.", "NTA.  If you stop helping your sister will have to figure it out like you have done.  Don\u2019t feel bad about it either.  Honesty and openness should be a requirement when loaning money.  She is asking and you have the right to say no.  They helped you, and you have helped them.  How much payback are they expecting?  For the rest of your life?  Helping is a give and take, you have given and they have taken.  Time to end the sister ATM situation.

You are right that there is no transparency - it doesn\u2019t sound like your sister is doing anything meaningful to improve her situation. She can\u2019t expect handouts from you forever. Also, the longer you give her money the less incentive she has to help herself. It\u2019s a good time to stop enabling her.", "NTA I would want to know what I'm paying for like if you need food I'll go shopping with you if you \"need\" a new iPhone no", "NTA, but I would suggest that every time your mom calls asking for money you put that amount into savings. I bet it adds up to a lot by the end of a year. You\u2019ll need that savings if you\u2019re ever in a bind again or for retirement. Stop giving your hard earned money away to mooching family.\n\nMy other suggestion would be to call your mother and say your hours have been cut back at work and you need some money to help cover your bills\u2026.maybe your sister could pay back some of the money you\u2019ve spent covering her bills?", "NTA.\n\nStop pouring water into a bucket with no bottom.\n\nIt's one thing to help people in need. It's a completely other issue to take advantage of that.\n\nJust start telling them; you don't have the money to help them. Start a GoFundMe for your sister. Anytime a relative complains, steer them towards that.  Tell them to put up or shut up.", "Given that mom and sister are unwilling to discuss why sister needs money so often, it suggests the issue may be as much outflow issues as income.\n\nJust getting a higher paying job won't help much, if there is no budget management to match. On the other hand, if poor spending is the issue, getting a handle on that can make a real impact even without an income change.\n\nThe lack of willingness to discuss and the lack of interest in a job opportunity, when mentioned, also suggests that mom and the sister know what the real issues are. They're just unwilling to make the personal life changes needed to solve the issues on their own.", "Always being blamed even though I know I am not in the wrong, but \"equal punishment\" rule in the house. So if sis got yelled at for sneaking out, I got yelled at for anything too. Cause it's only fair. Sis piss mom off, mom piss at me and it \"yall are horrible. I can't stand you two. Your father can't handle you guys\" even though I wasn't the one doing bad. I was \"the perfect child\" to everyone around. I could simply loose my temper and I am being threatened and told how I am a disgrace, lives in a fantasy world (because my dream is to be an artist) and all other insults of any insecurities.
