Plus, our last name is H-P and they don\u2019t care about changing our names, they only care about the baby\u2019s name\u2014 which means we will have a different last name than OUR kid. \n\nSide note: my cousin who makes 20k a year, openly gave us 15k and he did not demand the kid to be named after him.

But he wants it known that\u2019s how much he is losing out on this deal.\n\nMore side note: not ONCE have I been included in the naming of my child btw.

It seems like your in-laws have strong opinions about the order of last names and are willing to make significant financial threats to get their way. Here are some aspects to consider:\n\n1. Naming Your Child: The order of last names is a personal choice for you and your husband. You should feel comfortable with the name you choose for your child, and it should reflect your preferences and values.\n2. Family Dynamics: The issue of your in-laws disowning your husband is a serious matter. It's crucial for you and your husband to have a united front when dealing with this situation. Consider how your husband's relationship with his parents might be affected and whether he is willing to accept the potential consequences.\n3. Financial Assistance: You mentioned that your in-laws have provided financial support for you and your husband, which includes co-signing on your home loan and giving you money. While you're grateful for their help, it's essential to remember that financial support should not come with controlling your personal decisions.\n4. Legal Implications: The legal process of changing a child's last name varies by jurisdiction. It's essential to be aware of the legal requirements and implications in your area before making any decisions.\n\nUltimately, you are not the one asking to change the last name; it's your in-laws who are making this request. You should prioritize your child's well-being and your personal preferences when making the decision. Whether or not you're the \"asshole\" depends on your stance, but it's crucial to have open and honest communication with your husband about how you both want to handle this situation. Your husband's relationship with his parents and the potential financial consequences should also be taken into account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: NTA", "> Do not change it.

I\u2019m in the US.", "well what's done is done. your children's names are on their birth certificate, and no your not TA, I do think the grandparents are TA for using potential money as a form of blackmail. And make no mistake , it is blackmail.", "Why do you ask if 2 million is material enough to have your IL have their say when you want the presumptive inheritance in ant case?\n\nThere is no diplomacy here, just money.\n\nChange the name.\n\n2 million is immaterial for persons that can sustain themselves in a dignified manner, and maybe even like working.", "Oh gosh. I understand. I am sorry for what you are going through. I relate a tiny bit. I was never promised all the financial stuff, but my daughter grew up very confused about her last name. Other details came to light, and now she doesn\u2019t share the last name of either me or her dad. His last name was apparently a debate at birth too. So now she has a name (age24) that no one in the family has. She decided she doesn\u2019t care.", "Husband here. I never said I am going to bend to him. Just that we need to be diplomatic in the way I say no to him. Although from my father and i's preliminary text conversation, it's like being diplomatic with a charging bull.", "There is closer to 12 mil in inheritance total. But 2 mil is the cash he can lock up in an irrevocable trust that my mother won't be able to squander. I assume all other assets will be squandered by my mother after his (likely soon) death.\n\n-husband", "What's with your weird little tick about referring to OPs parents as mummy and Daddy? Do you still call your parents that or something? Or do you not know how to get your opinion across without being toxic and patronising about it? You've done it twice now, this one you've come back to a different part of the comment section after commenting in a completely different post, just to say it again... so I'm going with the latter. You like being patronising. \ud83d\udc04", "No, not over that. I will not be going back on my word with my wife. But I can still play this situation so I am not ostracized forever. I have a sister I do deeply love, and I know I wouldn't talk to me if my father made the demand.\n\nI have to be diplomatic from all sides\n\n-husband", "Get a back bone, dude. Your parents are awful for controlling you and your child (and by extension your wife), but you also suck bc you can\u2019t stand up to your parents. Wife is NTA", "This \"guy\" gets that you're more concerned with money than standing up to mommy and daddy.", "Which IMO we can sustain ourselves. Maybe not now, but I\u2019m in law school and he\u2019s trying to get into law school. I don\u2019t see why we need to rely on $2 mil imaginary inheritance when we could build a life and make that for our kids to never be put through what he\u2019s currently going through.\n\nWife here", "Its something about them being white and racist. Which is entirely true they are very racist towards her and treated her as flavor of the month for many years because of her race. It's gotten better noe that she's pregnant but she still resents them and their doting ways.\n\n-husband", "Bro stop acting like it's only a matter of a couple hundred bucks. Dude is literally being told to choose between a name and two million dollars. Stop acting like that's an easy decision for someone who doesn't have a lot of money. I seriously doubt you'd walk away from 2 freaking million just to keep a name one way around.\n\nEdit: omg lol. Your entire comment history is you spending hours here daily on AITA. You need to go touch grass before this sub poisons you some more.", "Thank you.\n\n-wife here", "Someone understands the value of a dollar.\n\nBut the others chiming in about the additional demands are absolutely correct. If they see this works, it will be the first of many demands on pain of being disinherited. So I have to handle this diplomatically. He can't get his way and he needs to see why I can't be allowed to bend to his will or it will never end.\n\n-husband", "There will be never ending demands concerning your child if you do this now. You have to shine some spine and tell them they can\u2019t throw their weight around where your child is concerned. \n\nEvery time you disagree from now until they die will be the same so just rip the band aid off unless you want to be doormats forever. Also they can say all they like but until they actually die and a will is read - and clearly they will live forever as spite is quiet the preserver- there\u2019s nothing but nonsense promises and threats. \n\nIt\u2019ll drive you mad and ruin your marriage.", "Which is why I'd never suggest to you what to do. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Can you survive without that 2 million in the future? It is a lot to walk away from, but is a lifetime being under the thumb and even your childs name isnt your own decision, worth a $2 million reward later on in the future? Only you two can answer that one, because only you two know your full circumstances. Good luck.", "I have a father like your parents. In my experience the demands don't end. I finally conceded to just say fuck it, disinherit me, let me live my life. Interestingly, that hasn't happened yet and now he can't hold a possible inheritance over my head to try to control me. Your parents could be alive for another 30-40 years. How much do you want to give of yourself for an amount you can't even reliably retire on anymore? In 10 years, 2 mil might not even be worth the trouble and the damage to your own family.", "We don't need the money. But if you're disinherited, you're also cut off socially. It is to be cut out of the family entirely, and I want my child to know their family regardless of my father's contempt for how we name the child.\n\nHusband", "What's the rest of the family like? They can't be that great if they're will to also cut you off over a name.", "A mix of white-collar criminals, overworked business owners, and well paid government workers. Their loyalty is with the people who can provide them the most advantage and favors, so certainly not to me and my kid. They are all incredibly backstabby and only care about money. My kind of people.\n\n-husband"]}
