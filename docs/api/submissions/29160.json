Continue developing your form at low weights, then 'level up' when you're comfortable.

You *should be* lifting the weight you're comfortable with; there is no standard \\[19m\\] bicep curl that you *should* be able to do.\n\nI would say, pay attention to your appetite if you want to know whether you're 'doing enough': if your appetite is growing, it means your body is converting more resources to energy & muscle than it was.
