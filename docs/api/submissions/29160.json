I work with what I'm comfortable on, then when it feels easy. I do a drop set using the next weight up, until I can do a full set with that weight. \n\nYou got this!", "Hey, man. definitely go slow, you don't want to hurt yourself, but can i add a piece of advice?\n\nOne of the fastest ways to increase strength involves \"Progressive Overload\", meaning that your are incrementally adding small amounts of more *work* inorder to increase what your muscles *need* to be able to do.\n\nI would definitely give progressive overload a look on google.\n\nThe way it would apply to your Bicep curls would be that you have a range, lets say 8-12 reps, and when you're gaining strength session by session, you should go from being able to do 8 to 10 to 12 reps of said weight, at which point you would then ever slightly increase the weight and then target the lowest rep amount on your range scale. If you can't do at least 6 you should probably drop the weight back down.\n\n Kind of a newbie lifter myself but I put over 100 pounds on my bench max in about a year by just being very diligent with progressive overload.", "Solid Dadvice.", "For all y\u2019all know bc they\u2019re kids they let em.", "\ud83d\ude2d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb", "Well then ig women can\u2019t hurt abuse or rxpe men then.

I truly don\u2019t.", "The one he quoted only covered like 60 people. And tbh if I was a pro team going against kids. Nah I wouldn\u2019t go all out. I\u2019d want them to win.

It\u2019s interesting you say that because I know quite a few people who didn\u2019t love sports but do enjoy lifting weights, my bodybuilding coach is one of them! For me at least I could be having the worst day and just by showing up at the gym, by being there I\u2019m actively doing something to better myself and that feels fulfilling.\n\nIn my opinion it is one of the best hobbies you can have, so I hope you stick with it! Of course I am extremely biased haha.", "This is a lot of bs . Any man will have higher musculature than women just by doing basic day to day activities like carrying a backpack , lifting some furniture , move object from point A to point B . \n\nUnless you have a disability , ANY MAN above the age of 17 should curl more than 6 kg . \n\nEspecially considering OP said he worksout for a few months .\n\nI don't take the bait . This post is fake and made by a girl or a child below the age of 15", "It\u2019s true that men develop into their twenties. But the second part about athletes being early bloomers is simply not true. In fact it is more common that those who show potential early, are pushed hard too young and burn out before reaching their peak athletic years.", "3 x 10, dumbbell curl with good slow form according to OP", "Imagine a woman using a knife or gun lol", "I was just adding a bit of statistical context to the conversation", "It covered over 2000 people if you looked at the numbers. 60 of those people were highly trained female athletes in sports where grip strength is important", "They have to take enough in order to become more masculine, which is going to be more than a biological female human\u2019s natural testosterone levels. Their levels will also not fluctuate and be influenced by other hormones, so they will be more anabolic by definition.\n\nSaying they \u201cdon\u2019t take enough to build muscle\u201d is physiologically nonsense because a biological female can build muscle even with *significantly* lower testosterone than the lowest T male. If taking synthetic testosterone to have higher T than a biological female doesn\u2019t actually make one more masculine, then why do they do it? The fact is it does make them more masculine, which is why it is easier for trans men to build muscle compared to biological females because they are in a constant anabolic state, even more so than a biological male.", "You weren't curling your guitar case I imagine.\n\nDo you lift yourself? If not then you may not be quite appreciating how the type of movement significantly changes how relatively heavy a weight feels. It depends on whether you're doing a compound vs isolated movement and which muscle(s) you're using and your repetitions. \n\nWhen you are carrying around a case you are using a lot of muscles, whereas Bicep curls as the name suggests targets just the Bicep muscles. So curling 6kg is very different to just lifting or carrying it in a normal day to day setting. So it's like comparing apples and oranges comparing you carrying your guitar case to how much op can curl", "Fam I know women don\u2019t need any of that to hurt a man I\u2019m trying to show him what their incessant need for flexing physical strength on women has an effect on. Bc it wasn\u2019t women who created that idea btw. It was men bc they think they\u2019re inherently stronger than any/most women.\n\nThat\u2019s why I asked how does this benefit anyone? And what does it have to really do with the OPs question? It doesn\u2019t and nothing. Men just wanting to flex on women. As always. But we can flex right back on not being as single or dumb. Women use more of their white matter than men do even tho we have more grey matter. \n\nPhysical strength is all that\u2019s left bc we know they\u2019re not smarter they\u2019re not hotter they\u2019re not as emotionally intelligent. And the stats of single lonely men keep rising while it doesn\u2019t for us.\n\nAnd none of that hurts women to flex tbh.", "With a study on only 60 people. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nWe know men are born with more muscle mass and bone density.

Women can be stronger.", "They\u2019re not taking nearly enough that these body builders and gym rats are taking even tho they already have higher levels of testosterone. You missed my point ENTIRELY by a mile. They don\u2019t take it for that and not near as much. Go look at their dosages compared.", "You sound upset.", "Yes I agree. Hence the 90% number. Feel free to respond with a study that shows something different, I would be genuinely interested\n\nAlso the study was on 2000 people fyi", "No one said trans men are on TRT just to gain muscle mass (though that is included in being more masculine), so I don\u2019t really see your point. My point was that the people saying there\u2019s no difference between trans men and biological men in regards to testosterone for muscle building are wrong. It is much easier for Buck Angel on a lower dose of T (do we even know his levels?) to build muscle than a natural man because his testosterone is not naturally produced by the body. This is why it is significantly easier to be a bodybuilder who is enhanced compared to a natural bodybuilder. It\u2019s not just the enhanced T levels themselves; it\u2019s the enhanced anabolic state.", "No way that dude lifts at all, above he\u2019s comparing carrying a freaking backpack to a bicep curl. I didn\u2019t realize exactly the numbers until I converted to pounds but yea being 110 pounds curling 35s at age 14 with no prior training at all? That\u2019s completely laughable"]}
