{"id": 9896, "submission_id": "111hv78", "title": "AITA for asking to move seats on an airplane?", "selftext": "My boyfriend (m24) and I (23) were flying back home on a two hour flight at 2am. While waiting in line to board the plane, there was a family of four in front of us. A man and wife who looked to be in their 40\u2019s, one child (I\u2019m assuming five) and one baby who wasn\u2019t more than two years old. \n\nThe five year old was bouncing off the walls, absolutely full of energy. He was trying to ride his carry-on like a car, and kept ramming into my luggage on accident. The baby was crying very loudly as well. I felt bad for the parents because they were trying their best to keep their kids under control to no avail. \n\nWhen we boarded the plane, the family sat down across the aisle from me and my boyfriend. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t happy about sitting next to a rambunctious kid and a baby who had already been crying for 15+ minutes. All seats were assigned, but the plane was half empty even with all the passengers boarded. I noticed a couple, who was sitting in front of the family, asked to move to the back, most likely because they didn\u2019t want to sit next to the children. The flight attendants allowed them to move no problem. I decided that I also wanted to change our seats, but when I asked the flight attendant, she said no because of the weight distribution on the plane. It seemed most passengers congregated to the back of the plane to sit further away from this family. I then asked her if I could purchase first-class tickets and be moved to the front because I saw there were two seats still available. Again, she said no because all transactions had to be done at the counter before we boarded. I understood her points completely, so boyfriend and I stayed in our original seats. \n\nThe baby cried for the first hour of the flight, and the older child kept bouncing in his seat and talking loudly. My boyfriend and I had noise-canceling headphones in, but could still hear the children next to us. I tried to keep a stoic expression because I didn\u2019t want the parents to know how annoyed I was. At some point, the five-year old accidentally spilled juice on my shoes from squeezing his juice box too hard (child and I had aisle seats so we were basically next to each other). The parents side-eyed me and my boyfriend the entire flight. They apologized for the juice incident when it happened, but I felt their glares until we landed. \n\nWhen we were getting off the plane, I asked them \u201cExcuse me. I noticed you and your husband keep looking in our direction. Can we help you with something\u201d. The husband basically told me off for being rude by \u201cputting in so much effort to get away from them\u201d and \u201cgoing as far as offering to buy first-class tickets\u201d. I told them I didn\u2019t mean any harm. It was the middle of the night and I was hoping to get some sleep during the flight. I wanted to find a solution without bothering anyone. \n\nAITA for asking to move seats? I just wanted a quieter without inconveniencing anyone.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to clarify, I\u2019m not against kids on planes. I just wanted to sit somewhere quieter so I could nap. Also, the parents didn\u2019t stop glaring or gossiping about me until we reached baggage claim. That\u2019s where I spoke to them. I wanted to ask them to stop staring at me, but I was worried it would be too direct, so I said what I wrote in my post.", "created_utc": 1676317088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111hv78/aita_for_asking_to_move_seats_on_an_airplane/", "score": 465, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Parents have to plan for trips, and it sounds like these folks gave several issues little thought. The infant was probably squalling because the pressure changes were ripping its head apart! Learning ahead of time how to mitigate that would have probably ameliorated the situation at least a bit. It sounds like they had no distractions for the older child: carrot stix, coloring, other age appropriate toys, maybe a binky and favorite blanket.

When you are in a situation like that you as the parent have a limited number of tools at your disposal to prevent your children from disturbing others, and that just escalates the stress. If other people leave, then your children aren't bothering them! The tension eases. Obviously you can't make people leave, but if they do on their own you thank the gods and move on.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

There\u2019s a lot of reasons for parents to take public transportation with their children, and they were definitely more stressed than I was. I think the entire family was restless because it was 2am. And you\u2019re right! They didn\u2019t have anything for the older child to keep his hands busy with.

You weren't rude so I'm not sure what their problem is. Surely they'd feel more comfortable if you did move and they could stress a bit less about disturbing others and spread their family out more.", "NTA. It's one thing for parents to think they are entitled to bring their brats into planes, another for them to think we aren't entitled to judge them for their inability to parent them properly. And to all the downvoters? Yes. We are judging you to be selfish and sloppy parents when stuff like this happens.", "Another great example of why we need to stop populating the world lol \n\nStop feeding corporations cheap labor.", "NTA - I'm sorry you had that experience, it sounds like you handled it well. You explored your options for solving the situation and when none of them were possible, you didn't make a scene or get rude... instead you accepted you fate and made no further fuss. That automatically puts you ahead of at least 80% of passengers out there.\n\nThe husband, however, was a total AH for both passive-aggressively side-eyeing you throughout the flight and then for telling you off when you asked what was up. I get that traveling with kids can be difficult, but don't take your frustrations out on the other passengers!", "The 5 year old was confined to a small space for a long time and had excess energy. There is only so much you can do. It doesn't sound like they were overly problematic, just way too loud for 2a.m and again, that happens when traveling", "Then they would have said 'We weren't staring at you'.", "I'd honestly take a loud kid over a loud adult any day. I once sat next to a baby who screamed for an entire 4 hour flight. It sucked, but I felt bad for the little guy and his stressed-out parents. The flight attendant kept offering me free wine. I don't drink, but I appreciated it nonetheless. It was a bad day, but shit happens, right?\n\nCompare that to the bitch who sat behind me on my last flight, loudly commentating through the entire movie she was watching, complaining about everything from the seat width to the food quality, telling her seatmates her life story against their will, calling the flight attendant for random bullshit every five minutes, and cackling like a deranged clown at her own jokes? Yah, I wanted to turn around and fucking throttle her like Bart Simpson, I don't think I've ever been that irrationally angry in my life. I was legit having violent fantasies. \n\nIf I must deal with a screeching toddler, I'd rather it be an *actual toddler,* at least they have a good excuse for being a pain in the ass."]}
