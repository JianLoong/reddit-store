{"id": 9896, "submission_id": "111hv78", "title": "AITA for asking to move seats on an airplane?", "selftext": "My boyfriend (m24) and I (23) were flying back home on a two hour flight at 2am. While waiting in line to board the plane, there was a family of four in front of us. A man and wife who looked to be in their 40\u2019s, one child (I\u2019m assuming five) and one baby who wasn\u2019t more than two years old. \n\nThe five year old was bouncing off the walls, absolutely full of energy. He was trying to ride his carry-on like a car, and kept ramming into my luggage on accident. The baby was crying very loudly as well. I felt bad for the parents because they were trying their best to keep their kids under control to no avail. \n\nWhen we boarded the plane, the family sat down across the aisle from me and my boyfriend. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t happy about sitting next to a rambunctious kid and a baby who had already been crying for 15+ minutes. All seats were assigned, but the plane was half empty even with all the passengers boarded. I noticed a couple, who was sitting in front of the family, asked to move to the back, most likely because they didn\u2019t want to sit next to the children. The flight attendants allowed them to move no problem. I decided that I also wanted to change our seats, but when I asked the flight attendant, she said no because of the weight distribution on the plane. It seemed most passengers congregated to the back of the plane to sit further away from this family. I then asked her if I could purchase first-class tickets and be moved to the front because I saw there were two seats still available. Again, she said no because all transactions had to be done at the counter before we boarded. I understood her points completely, so boyfriend and I stayed in our original seats. \n\nThe baby cried for the first hour of the flight, and the older child kept bouncing in his seat and talking loudly. My boyfriend and I had noise-canceling headphones in, but could still hear the children next to us. I tried to keep a stoic expression because I didn\u2019t want the parents to know how annoyed I was. At some point, the five-year old accidentally spilled juice on my shoes from squeezing his juice box too hard (child and I had aisle seats so we were basically next to each other). The parents side-eyed me and my boyfriend the entire flight. They apologized for the juice incident when it happened, but I felt their glares until we landed. \n\nWhen we were getting off the plane, I asked them \u201cExcuse me. I noticed you and your husband keep looking in our direction. Can we help you with something\u201d. The husband basically told me off for being rude by \u201cputting in so much effort to get away from them\u201d and \u201cgoing as far as offering to buy first-class tickets\u201d. I told them I didn\u2019t mean any harm. It was the middle of the night and I was hoping to get some sleep during the flight. I wanted to find a solution without bothering anyone. \n\nAITA for asking to move seats? I just wanted a quieter without inconveniencing anyone.", "created_utc": 1676317088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111hv78/aita_for_asking_to_move_seats_on_an_airplane/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't do anything wrong.

You explored your options and kept it together in a situation that would make me spontaneously combust.", "NTA i think they are trying to guilt you for them having unruly children", "NTA. You have the right to move. You don't need to suffer anything because their feelings would be hurt.", "NTA. They should have just upgraded you. They knew the problem and it wouldn\u2019t have killed than. Jeez", "NTA. I\u2019d have been trying to move as well no one wants sit next to noisy kids on a flight especially at 2am, parents should understand better that other people do not love their children.", "NTA.

This set of parents were just embarrassed for their family's behavior and couldn't deal with their shame in a adult way.", "NTA to ask, no.", "NTA but you didn\u2019t have to say anything there. Travelling with kids is hard, even harder when they won\u2019t be quiet and everyone else is acting like you\u2019re monsters. Unless they were doing nothing to try and placate the children they will have been stressed enough", "NTA for anything on the flight, but it was entirely unnecessary to confront them about the looks. It's a stressful situation and they did their best. You guys had every right to want to get away from them just like everyone else, but it's not like they were saying anything to you.", "ESH\n\nThe parents should have controlled their children better. No one likes sitting next to misbehaved children, but unfortunately, that's life. \n\nYou and boyfriend did try your best with the cards that you were given. I'm not sure how successful you were at keeping a \"stoic expression\". Should the parents have come up to you afterwards? No, I think that was out of line. \n\nI wouldn't think too much about it. It was one flight. Just chalk it up to a bad occurrence and move on.", "ESH\n\nYou asked to move seats, and respected the flight attendant\u2019s stance that you couldn\u2019t. So you put on headphones, and tried your best to ignore them. That should\u2019ve been the end of it, but you just had to poke the bear by asking why they were staring at you. You KNEW why they were side eyeing you. You didn\u2019t need to create additional confrontation.\n\nThey are also at fault here for being offended that people don\u2019t want to sit near them. They are allowed to fly with their kids, but they have to accept that if they are going to let one of them disturb other passengers, it\u2019s all their fault that people ask to move. They can\u2019t be offended by a situation they created.", "YTA for approaching them because they looked at you. Grow up. I'm sure your expression said it all. Next time buy first class or a private jet so you aren't inconvenienced.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wasn\u2019t going to say anything at first, but it was very obvious they wanted me to know I made them upset.

Sounds like you're flattering yourself into thinking you were all they were worried about. How do you know they were whispering about you or glaring if you we're minding your own business. Something tells me your face said it all anyway.", "But it sounds like OP was looking to argue for no reason. The kids have just as much of a right to be there as her.", "No because family paid just like them. If they wanted to be sure they weren't bothered they should gone first class from the jump (still no guarantee), driven or taken a private jet\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Because they were whispering loud enough that I could hear them. Every time I looked up, the husband was glaring in my direction.", "If you read OP\u2019s comments, the parents were openly whispering and glaring at them for over two hours. OP likely just wanted them to knock it off. To me, it sounds like the husband was waiting for OP to react so he could tell them off.", "Fuck that. First class is for silence and quiet. OP tried paying for first class. Really the staff should have upgraded them for free after they even offered to pay.\n\nIf I'm paying first class prices I don't want to be stuck near a crying child", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Airline didn't owe OP shit. She should have gotten first class from the jump if she didn't want to be bothered.", "Oh sorry she didn't have the ability to read the future and see an annoying child was there. Considering she was willing to pay more if they'd told her at the gate she would have. It was the staff being difficult\n\nThey let literally everyone else around them move. It was the least they could do.", "If it's something she was worried about (especially since the odds were pretty great) she should have bought them from the jump.", "No they aren't. If most of the plane was able to move away they clearly weren't likely to be the unlucky ones stuck near the bad parents.\n\nYou're defending this so hard it makes me think you've got a load of kids you can't control. Why else would you be so insecure about it?"]}
