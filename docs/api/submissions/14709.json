You can't see my porch from the road and there's no back yard so that means they are physically going on my porch to snoop.

So I go downstairs, because I just ordered my son's phone a week ago. They have the box in their hands, shaking it, looking at the details, looking out toward the road (as if they were looking for anyone watching them so they could take it). I open the door and immediately confront them and get on the phone with the police. They are saying sorry, they were just curious, etc but I truly don't care at this point. Going through people's mail is a federal offense and this was physically in my box (more like a cubby). Needless to say, they were charged with attempted theft and going through my mail. My landlord is livid and I was given an eviction (I don't care- I was on my way out anyways). She says I've \"traumatized her kids over curiosity and have put a serious charge on their record\". AIA? My next door neighbor says I jumped to the extreme.\n\nETA: there has been other issues with the girls going through my stuff- like my phone that I left on the railing in the hallway.
