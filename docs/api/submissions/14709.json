Like sending over maintenance claiming it's an \"emergency\" water leak situation when there isn't, just to make sure my place is clean. Later following up with \"Just so you know, my crew noticed a pair of shoes in the hallway, those need to be taken inside\" or \"My crew noticed you had garbage on the porch. Put it in a bin.\" I'm on the 3rd floor and the rest of the building is vacant. You can't see my porch from the road and there's no back yard so that means they are physically going on my porch to snoop. And disclaimer: my garbage is in bins usually but I happened to be disinfecting my bin that day so there was one single bag sitting on the porch. \n\nFor about a year now she has been sending her twin girls over to \"sweep and mop\" my hallway. They leave it drenched. I clean my own hallway. No where in the lease does it say this would be happening. In fact, it says I'm responsible for upkeep on my hallway. But these girls spend way too much time out there. Laughing, giggling and conversing for 30+ minutes (my hallway is small- like a 5 minute job max). I've asked that she stop sending them here, as I almost slipped with my child in my arms the last time she sent them because the floors are literally soaked. She disregarded it and continued to send them. \n\nThey show up here today and I just ignore it. My kids are at school. When I hear them go back downstairs I came out on my porch and I hear them start talking about a package on the porch and saying \"omg it's a phone\" and \"I wonder if it's nicer than mine\". So I go downstairs, because I just ordered my son's phone a week ago. They have the box in their hands, shaking it, looking at the details, looking out toward the road (as if they were looking for anyone watching them so they could take it). I open the door and immediately confront them and get on the phone with the police. They are saying sorry, they were just curious, etc but I truly don't care at this point. Going through people's mail is a federal offense and this was physically in my box (more like a cubby). Needless to say, they were charged with attempted theft and going through my mail. My landlord is livid and I was given an eviction (I don't care- I was on my way out anyways). She says I've \"traumatized her kids over curiosity and have put a serious charge on their record\". AIA? My next door neighbor says I jumped to the extreme.\n\nETA: there has been other issues with the girls going through my stuff- like my phone that I left on the railing in the hallway. When I came out (not realizing I left it there), it says \"too many failed log in attempts, try again in 10 minutes\". So there's other issues.", "created_utc": 1681398334, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ks7oq/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_my_landlords_14yo/", "score": 333, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
