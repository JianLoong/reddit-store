You used to see your sister a lot, then you started dating him and he \"has issues\" with your closeness? That's him trying to remove your support system. He doesn't want you to see a doctor for your mental health? He's trying to keep you dependant on him.\n\nFocus on your mental health and file for divorce. He *does not care about you.*", "OP, I cannot stress to you enough that you are NOT the AH. NTA all day. \n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder presents in so many unique ways, and you need empathy from someone to help deal with your symptoms. \n\nSounds like to me that your anxiety is being exacerbated by your husband. If you can please take him with you to a session to understand what you are going through, that would be so beneficial. Unfortunately it seems like he is isolating you from your loved ones to keep you to himself. If this is the case, please seek help and safely get out of this situation.", "NTA. \n\nWhen I struggled with intrusive thoughts last year, at first I didn't tell my husband so I didn't worry him. I finally told him about it when I decided to get treatment but he didn't realize how severe it was until we did a joint session with a therapist. He was really hurt that I didn't feel safe coming to him at first but said he would always be there for me and asked me to promise to tell him about the thoughts in the future. \n\nThat is how a reasonable and caring partner reacts to the situation you're in. Your husband's reaction is 100% unreasonable, unhealthy, and you did nothing wrong. \n\nHe's the asshole and you'd be better off without him in your life.", "NTA\n\nSometimes people just need to vent or advice and in my view there\u2019s nothing wrong with going to a sibling or a long term friend for advice\u2026Especially when it sounds like you already knew you didn\u2019t have support if you approached your husband about struggling with your mental health given his thoughts on it\n\nHowever the fact he makes fun of your family, Downplays your emotional needs and doesn\u2019t approve of you spending time with your sister makes me wonder is he like that with friends as well??? If you\u2019re living in fear of upsetting him it\u2019s time to end the marriage\n\nPersonally I think you\u2019ll end up better off and you\u2019ll get the last laugh", "No wonder you are anxious if this is how your husband usually reacts. Your intrusive thoughts are about loss and you are losing your family because he is isolating you. Please look after yourself as this relationship doesn't sound healthy. He may be doing you a favour by offering you a divorce though if take his offer,make sure you have protection to actually leave.\n\nEdit: by the way, your daughter is watching all this. My GAD is partially caused by constant assessment and judgement as a child. I prefer not to socialise as couldn't cope with the constant critique on how I did it wrong afterwards. If he treats her like he does you,her mental health will likely suffer.", "Wait so your husband is upset you talked to your sister about the mental health issues you are facing ?", "NTA. if confiding in him that you have anxiety and intrusive thoughts that your life is gonna be overturned by some random event, results in him flipping on you for a miscellaneous and insecure reason, then i think you found a source of your issues", "NTA and get away from your husband.  He's gaslighting you. He is normalizing you to this mental abuse. He's trying to cut you off from your sister. Honestly there are so many red flags here, it's hard to believe you can't see them, but it's often the case with red flags that outsiders see them clearly while insiders have become color blind.", "Info:\nSo what have you communicated to your husband? Have you essentially lied about 95% of your thoughts to him for years? Because thats what you told us, and if i were your husband, i would feel cheated on to learn that my wife has just pretended everything for the past years.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't feel comfortable or that he was a safe and understanding person to talk about this with, so you went to someone you did. That's a win and exactly what you should have done.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he is actually verbally or emotionally abusive to you.", "NTA, but could your husband be the cause of your anxiety? You have already changed your life to please him, so you're not living as your best and authentic self. Just a thought maybe worth exploring with a therapist. But he sounds abusive for sure. The first step in abuse is isolating you from others who will tell you something isn't right. You are being manipulated. Take him up on his offer of divorce, but be careful. His abuse might turn physical, he thinks you are his and might not let you go easily.", "He is definitely TA. Not only for flipping it, but for everything else also.

And usually when we have company, I get told off for things that I had said or done that made him look a certain way. \nI have an almost 5 year old daughter. So I stay because I am not ready to break up her family. I also know for a fact that he will fight dirty where I just would like to come at this with mutual respect for each other. \nI have no clue how to get out.
