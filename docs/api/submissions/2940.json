I also found I had no cleaning supplies, toilet paper, food, or even bedding/towels as well as a broken kitchen sink. I found that my bed was put together wrong and that I had no remote to inflate the mattress again after fixing it, and called my brother who said he would look for it later but didn't know where it was. \n\nAt midnight, I called again and he said he found it but wouldn't bring it because he was tired, this is where I might be the asshole, I went off about how disgusting the house was and that his stay in the house was supposed to be an opportunity to get back on his feet and I would appreciate it if he brought the remote because I was tired. At this point, we were on speaker and his girlfriend jumped on the phone saying they did me a favor and I shouldn\u2019t complain because it was not in bad shape.

All he had to do wad go to my house, water my plants, keep the cats litter boxes clean, and make sure they were fed.

I had bought large bags of cat food before I left. Rather than filling their bowls, he was taking them and cutting them open and dumping them on the floor. Instead of filling water bowls, he took my big roasting pan and filled it with water once a week or so and left a faucet dripping instead. My plants were dead. My mailbox was bursting. I found cigarette butts everywhere and evidence that he'd had women over.
