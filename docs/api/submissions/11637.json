He said he expected it from other people but not from me. \n\nThis is because I've always jumped to babysit niece and nephew, and I love spending time with them.

You can like kids without liking all of them, or all of the time.", "NTA. This is a weird hill for him to die on. You can vacation wherever you please, and your motives are your own business. \n\nI have children, which makes me keenly aware of why other people might not want to be around them.

Hopefully he will get over himself soon.", "NTA - Adults need some adult only places and if bars and restaurants cannot be that, then by golly there should be adult only resorts.\n\nJeeze, it's not like you were advocating for the banning of children in public spaces.

Plus it's not like the fact that they don't allow children means you don't like your own niece and nephew", "NTA just because you offer to babysit your niece & nephew does not mean you're forbidden from going to an adults only resort. You have every right to enjoy your honeymoon as you see fit. Not everyone enjoys being around kids 24/7; not even 100% of the parents I know enjoy being around stranger's kids unless necessary.\n\nLast time my husband & I went to a family friendly resort, he befriended a teenager from another country & they played table tennis all afternoon one day; I was content lounging by the pool so I didn't mind but the kid's parents insisted on apologizing profusely since he strayed from their group activities (the kid's entire extended family vacation of 50+ people).", "NTA.

You can love children more than anything in the world and still enjoy spaces -particularly romantic tropical resorts *while on your honeymoon*\\- without them around. \n\nAnd as far as saying it while they were in the room... Why on earth would an eight year old care that you went somewhere he's not allowed? There are hundreds of places he's not permitted to go, and has no interest in being. Unless his dad makes a big deal out of it why the heck would he care? \n\nI feel like it might have been more about how it excludes your \\*brother\\* as someone who would be travelling with children, than how it excludes your niece and nephew.", "NTA. My parents went on lots of vacations and work trips where kids weren't allowed. It never made me believe that my parents wanted public spaces to be kid free or that they didn't want kids.

A lot of men are uncomfortable with women who are not All About the Babies, especially if those women also get along well with small people.\n\nYou can be kind to kids, love your niece and nephew, and still have a life outside of kids.

Sometimes they might have a nude or topless beach and some parents would object to that.  I don't think the niece and nephew really care one way or the other.

No offense, but after the kids are gone, I wanna go where only the adults are.  Just like Ariel, I wanna be where I am not right now - adult land.  It is exhausting being around kids 24/7.  I love mine, I really do, and I enjoy being with them.  We are active, go to Carowinds, the zoo, movies, etc.  But I too dream of a place where there are no kids.  Actually, I go places that kids are not allowed - on purpose just for short periods of time, and I enjoy it.  SJ, your brother is overreacting and is the AH here.  For real.  I have actually gone during school days by myself to the movies.  I loved it!  I think maybe he is feeling guilty for secretly dreaming of no kids land.  And he is taking his guilt out on you.  He will get over it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs to the kids being present - I have looked my own dead in the eye and said - guess what I did today - I went to see xyz and did not take you.  It was awesome.  My kids just give me the mental middle finger but go on with their lives as if I had said nothing.  They really don't care that much beyond the goofy parent telling them - I enjoyed myself with no kids.  Well actually my older 2 are adults now and completely understand why I go to the movies by myself intentionally.  My third does not want to be seen with me most days at the movies anyway- she is a pretween occasional twirp and very loved and cherished so I let her pretend that I am not her mom.  Just like I pretend like she is not my kids sometimes in public and say - I don't know that kid.  ;-)  Kids are resilient and generally don't Give A FU#@ about adult conversations or adult outings.
