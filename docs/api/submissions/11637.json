He said he expected it from other people but not from me. \n\nThis is because I've always jumped to babysit niece and nephew, and I love spending time with them.

You can like kids without liking all of them, or all of the time.", "NTA. This is a weird hill for him to die on. You can vacation wherever you please, and your motives are your own business. \n\nI have children, which makes me keenly aware of why other people might not want to be around them.

Plus it's not like the fact that they don't allow children means you don't like your own niece and nephew", "NTA just because you offer to babysit your niece & nephew does not mean you're forbidden from going to an adults only resort. You have every right to enjoy your honeymoon as you see fit. Not everyone enjoys being around kids 24/7; not even 100% of the parents I know enjoy being around stranger's kids unless necessary.\n\nLast time my husband & I went to a family friendly resort, he befriended a teenager from another country & they played table tennis all afternoon one day; I was content lounging by the pool so I didn't mind but the kid's parents insisted on apologizing profusely since he strayed from their group activities (the kid's entire extended family vacation of 50+ people).", "NTA.

You can love children more than anything in the world and still enjoy spaces -particularly romantic tropical resorts *while on your honeymoon*\\- without them around. \n\nAnd as far as saying it while they were in the room... Why on earth would an eight year old care that you went somewhere he's not allowed? There are hundreds of places he's not permitted to go, and has no interest in being.

A lot of men are uncomfortable with women who are not All About the Babies, especially if those women also get along well with small people.\n\nYou can be kind to kids, love your niece and nephew, and still have a life outside of kids.

Sometimes they might have a nude or topless beach and some parents would object to that.  I don't think the niece and nephew really care one way or the other.

He will get over it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs to the kids being present - I have looked my own dead in the eye and said - guess what I did today - I went to see xyz and did not take you.  It was awesome.

They really don't care that much beyond the goofy parent telling them - I enjoyed myself with no kids.  Well actually my older 2 are adults now and completely understand why I go to the movies by myself intentionally.  My third does not want to be seen with me most days at the movies anyway- she is a pretween occasional twirp and very loved and cherished so I let her pretend that I am not her mom.  Just like I pretend like she is not my kids sometimes in public and say - I don't know that kid.  ;-)  Kids are resilient and generally don't Give A FU#@ about adult conversations or adult outings.

Sometimes parents need a break too, and it isn't really one with other people's kids running around, either.", "NTA- I'm the mother of 4 and I look forward to the day I can go on a kid free vacation. I don't think everything should be kid friendly because not everyone wants to be around kids and should be able to places that are kid free. Your brother is being a little ridiculous about this, just because you like to be around his kids doesn't mean you have to be around them on vacation.", "He\u2019s jealous that you did something cool that is not accessible to him. He\u2019s the one being the asshole.", "NTA, and your brother sounds like a whiney chlid.", "I'm back home this week as my mom is getting worse and on the down slope. I get to see my 11 year old  niece who seemed sincerely happy I am in town. My SIL has a work dinner Thursday and I told them I will take her to her other grandma's place after they all come to see my mom. I'm looking forward to it, probably get asked to hang with them longer. Looking forward to it.\n\nThat said, when I go to Costa Rica next year it will be to adult-only places and tours. Nothing ruins the mood faster than shrieking kids or getting dirty looks because I dropped an F-bomb around someone's kid. \n\nNTA.  Your brother is just being an entitled dick....", "NTA, it's ridiculous that people can't just agree to disagree! There's a lot of vacations and resorts that should be child free, just as there are those focused on kids!", "NTA. What did he expect? You and your husband went on a honeymoon. Obviously, it is not disneyland. It is going to be a place for adults. Your brother is overreacting. Your niece and nephew is too young to understand \"adult only.\" You shouldn't let him lecture you over something you did nothing wrong. He asked the question and you answered it. Make sure you keep tab on him. See if he go into bar, night club or anything excluding kids. Say something to him like \"Oh, what would your kids think of you going to places for adult only? I thought you were better than this...\" lols", "NTA- you went to an adult only resort for your honeymoon, something that is an adult only activity generally and kids being around can intrude on the romance that is part and parcel of a honeymoon. Your brother is way out of line to be getting upset about this.", "NTA!   At all!  Your brother is being way too sensitive!   The horror of an adult only space!", "NTA. I have a kid and am planning to go back to an adult only resort I went to when I was younger. I love my child but I also love a relaxing vacation. She still gets to go on a lot of vacations but they aren\u2019t very relaxing for me.. kids don\u2019t have belong everywhere. I also don\u2019t take my child to the bar, movies, or work. Because those aren\u2019t places for her.\n\nGist: there\u2019s plenty of resorts geared towards kids. Thank god for the adult only ones.", "NTA. Your brother is so jealous of your child free life but won\u2019t admit it to himself.", "NTA\n\nNot everyone wants to deal with children underfoot, watching their language, if they're drunk, etc. Someone else's decision to have children does not entitle them to special favors or to force their children on everyone else in a given space.", "NTA.  There are plenty of places he can go with his kids.  Some of us prefer to vacation/honeymoon without them.  I'm a former teacher.  I loved my students but believe me when I say I didn't want to vacation with them or anyone under the age of 21 (okay, 25, really).  Not all public places are open to kids, nor should they be.  Following his logic, it would be perfectly okay for parents to haul their kids into the local strip joint.  Surely, he wouldn't want that to be an option?", "NTA. Mom of two small kids here. Every year my husband and I spend our anniversary at a resort that is not only adults only but also couples only. So guess I\u2019ll just have to live with knowing I give my money to a place that doesn\u2019t support Jim and his balding frat brothers taking over the pool and reliving their glory days singing their frat theme song drunk on Fireball all in the name of Jim\u2019s 40th birthday. Not sure how I\u2019ll sleep tonight with that burden on my chest. \n\nI am a huge believer in teaching kids how to be an adult. My kids are experts at fine dining (husband is a chef) and pros at ordering room service but I also believe in teaching them the whole world isn\u2019t obligated to cater to them. Your brother is going to create entitlement issues if he leads them to believe everyone should include them all the time. \n\nStand firm OP!", "NTA I went on my honeymoon to an adults only resort. I told everyone around me, and my son probably heard, that if I\u2019m going on vacation without my kid I don\u2019t want to be around anyone else\u2019s kid. I love adult only resorts. I love to be an adult, relax and not have kids running around all day.", "Your brother sounds exhausting. NTA", "URNTAH\u2026 your brother sounds incredibly immature and has no clue as to what matters in bringing up kids.  It\u2019s an adult only place because people want to relax without any screaming kids around.", "I\u2019m wondering exactly what kind of person would actually prefer a resort with children running around when they are IN THEIR HONEYMOON. WTH. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You literally gave him information about a place not judgement on being a parent. The heck is he in his feelings for?", "NTA. Not sure how 2 adults go to an adults only resort for their honeymoon was upsetting to your brother. Did he want to deal with someone else\u2019s children on his honeymoon. Tell him to grow up, it was not about him and his kids, it was your honeymoon", "NTA. He's being dramatic and an entitled parent. There are so so few adult-only spaces left. Some parents think their kids belong everywhere regardless of how it impacts the other adults around them. \n\nAsk him if he thinks you shouldn't talk about going to a movie that happens to be R-rated in front of the kids. Or taking about going to a bar in front of them.", "Doesn't your brother know this was your HONEYMOON?  If there's ever a time when you're going to take an adults-only trip, surely it's on your honeymoon!  Ask your brother if he took some young kids along when he went on his honeymoon.  Maybe if you tell him the resort caters to newlyweds, and most of the guests were honeymooners, he'll get the picture.  Besides, he has no right to decide where/how you should vacation any more than you would have to decide for him and  his wife (and kids, apparently)!", "NTA, your brother sounds like the kind of person who would try and bring his kids to something that really isn't meant for children...\nHe honestly can't be mad at you about this.", "Where I live it is illegal for underage people to sit at a bar that is actively serving alcohol. One place I worked had 2 bars(one main and the other the back bar). During private parties we let them sit at the back bar because there is no bartender and alcohol is not being poured there.", "He went out of his way to make OP's *honeymoon* somehow about excluding his kids.  Who weren't even there.  \n\nGot quite the persecution complex going on there.", "I grew up watching ads for the Sandals resorts. I just thought to myself: oh, that's a place where grownups go to do the kissing and cuddling (iirc that's what I used to think sex was). The kids probably weren't even paying attention, and if so, they probably don't care about a grownup place they won't be going to.", "Not in a legal sense, no. But in a social disapproval/hostility way, yes.\n\nLots of public spaces are inaccessible to people with strollers. And anytime a child cries in a restaurant, park, store, or plane, people act like it\u2019s the end of the world and complain and rant. \n\nWe have serious issues with a culture that\u2019s hostile to the practical needs of parents and children, while also encouraging a lack of delineation between family spaces and adult spaces.", "Nothing is better than a lot of happy, loud, and energetic kids at the pool on your honeymoon. \ud83d\ude44 In fact people have vowed to remain childless after a couple of those vacations. \ud83d\ude02 /s", "What if you replaced adult with white and kid with black? Would that be okay? Then why is adults only okay?", "But, to people like this, every space is a children's place and they should be able to go anywhere and everywhere to spread their \"joy.\" Sorry, a screaming kid isn't enjoyable to me, especially in certain circumstances. I deserve the right to be free of his children. NTA", "I say this as a theater worker, tell the staff. Odds are we'll tell the parents to either keep the kids quiet or kick them out.\n\nMy theater especially is really cracking down on children, we don't even let kids under 16 in after 5 anymore unless they're with their parents. It doesn't help with the adult \"children\" (and oh Lord as the bartender there do I have to deal with a lot of them) but it's been a noticeable improvement still", "Yes please! Sign me up for that!", "Rephrased bot comment stolen from: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k3q6l/aita_for_saying_i_really_enjoyed_an_adult_only/jb5rqwp/", "This!!!", "Omg yes that sounds perfect."]}
