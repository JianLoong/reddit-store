But its just a regular resort with no kids under 18? Your brother sounds like a pain in the ass if hes offended by that.", "NTA. He needs to get over himself.  I have kids and enjoy kid-free spaces when they are with their dad.", "NTA Your brother is being ridiculous and needs to calm down. Not everyone wants to go to child friendly places.

I love children. I have 3 children. They are all young adults. My husband and I recently went on a Virgin Voyages cruise and chose the cruise line for the fact that it is adult only.

Both of these are perfectly fine ways to operate a business.\n\nThis might be a shocker to your brother, but even some people who like their own kids and enjoy being parents don't want to be around other people's kids when they paid a lot of money for a vacation. Sometimes people just want to be able to fully relax on a vacation without additional responsibilities, or without exclusively attending child-friendly events on their vacation.

He sounds immature.", "NTA - your brother is confused and broken.", "What an odd thing to get upset over.

Wow, what a non-issue he\u2019s making into something.", "NTA. As a parent this resort sounds like a dream. I love my kid but a private resort is not a place for them.

So is he one of those people that take little kids to rated R slasher movies, thus scarring the children for life?", "NTA.

I'm a parent and I want to go!", "NTA - sorry but that\u2019s crazy! That should not bother your brother at all. Honestly I would back off from him and his family for a bit if I were you.

You\u2019re an adult without kids who wanted to go on a vacation with no kids. You\u2019re not saying you hate kids or that kids shouldn\u2019t be allowed in public.", "NTA. This is a very odd response from your brother. I would understand someone getting upset if their sibling said they really enjoyed a whites-only resort (hypothetically) in front of their mixed-race children, but otherwise it\u2019s very odd.", "NTA, and I know plenty of PARENTS who can't wait to go to a child-free resort. You can like kids without liking all of them, or all of the time.", "NTA. This is a weird hill for him to die on. You can vacation wherever you please, and your motives are your own business. \n\nI have children, which makes me keenly aware of why other people might not want to be around them. Adult only resorts seem like a a great option for people who don\u2019t want to hear constantly about how hungry and bored other guests are. \n\nLiking kids isn\u2019t the same as wanting to be around them all the time, particularly if you don\u2019t have any yourself. From what you\u2019ve described, I don\u2019t think you owe anyone any apologies. He can act like the adult he\u2019s supposed to be and get over it.", "NTA and your brother sounds insufferable. You can love kids and also want to spend some time with adults only for goodness sake.", "You are not an asshole. Hopefully he will get over himself soon.", "NTA - Adults need some adult only places and if bars and restaurants cannot be that, then by golly there should be adult only resorts.\n\nJeeze, it's not like you were advocating for the banning of children in public spaces. He needs to take it down a notch.", "NTA\n\nIt's not even your fault that the resort you went to didn't allow kids, and that doesn't mean you hate them. Plus it's not like the fact that they don't allow children means you don't like your own niece and nephew", "NTA just because you offer to babysit your niece & nephew does not mean you're forbidden from going to an adults only resort. You have every right to enjoy your honeymoon as you see fit. Not everyone enjoys being around kids 24/7; not even 100% of the parents I know enjoy being around stranger's kids unless necessary.\n\nLast time my husband & I went to a family friendly resort, he befriended a teenager from another country & they played table tennis all afternoon one day; I was content lounging by the pool so I didn't mind but the kid's parents insisted on apologizing profusely since he strayed from their group activities (the kid's entire extended family vacation of 50+ people).", "NTA. He is being weirdly oversensitive. It's fine for people who want a vacation free of kids to go to adults-only resorts and people who want family vacations to go to resorts that welcome kids. There is not a shortage of either adult or kid-friendly vacation destinations.", "NTA. Bro is overreacting.", "NTA and I have had kids but some times adults need to be kid free. We don\u2019t hate them but we want to go somewhere quit.", "NTA what an overreaction! You can love children more than anything in the world and still enjoy spaces -particularly romantic tropical resorts *while on your honeymoon*\\- without them around. \n\nAnd as far as saying it while they were in the room... Why on earth would an eight year old care that you went somewhere he's not allowed? There are hundreds of places he's not permitted to go, and has no interest in being. Unless his dad makes a big deal out of it why the heck would he care? \n\nI feel like it might have been more about how it excludes your \\*brother\\* as someone who would be travelling with children, than how it excludes your niece and nephew.", "NTA. My parents went on lots of vacations and work trips where kids weren't allowed. It never made me believe that my parents wanted public spaces to be kid free or that they didn't want kids.  This is weird and your brother seems overly sensitive.", "NTA.  A lot of men are uncomfortable with women who are not All About the Babies, especially if those women also get along well with small people.\n\nYou can be kind to kids, love your niece and nephew, and still have a life outside of kids.  You can enjoy kid free time.  There is nothing obligating you to have such baby rabies that you need to be around kids on your honeymoon.  (Serious WTF - who wants to be around kids on their honeymoon??!)\n\nSpeaking from unfortunate experience in this area, I bet your brother has already made a pile of comments to his kids about how Aunt MastersDegree is going to have babies immediately.  To the extent that the kids were \u201cupset,\u201d it\u2019s probably because their father has been priming them to expect babies to pop out 9-10 months after the wedding, tops.", "NTA. It was your honeymoon, why wouldn't you stay at an Adults only resort? If this is something your brother gives you the silent treatment over he has issues.", "So looking at the number of full family resorts in the world vs adult only resorts in the world, it's about 1 percent adult only.  ((As you know 85 percent of all statistics are made up on the fly)).  Adult only resorts also have more adult oriented entertainment.  Sometimes they might have a nude or topless beach and some parents would object to that.  I don't think the niece and nephew really care one way or the other.  Your brother is just frustrated because he wants to go places like that but can't due to he can't bring his kids.", "Nta. I dont get this attitude. Kids arent allowed in LOTS of spaces to PROTECT the kids.\n\nChances r the resort offers open bar/doesnt ID assuming everyone is of legal age. Or has a casino.

Heck, I even want to get away from my *own* kids sometimes. \n\nYour brother is being super weird; I don't know what you could say to get him to snap out of it, so your best bet is to just reassure him that you love your niblings and want to spend time with them, and then drop it without any further justification of why you chose an adult-only resort.\n\n\n**Edit:** If he DOES want to have it out about this, I think you could just say that while **he** would never let his children kick the back of someone's chair, throw silverware on the floor of the restaurant over and over, splash people in the face in the pool, or play chase in the hotel hallway while shrieking, there ARE parents who do allow their kids to do those things and there is nothing wrong with adults wanting to go somewhere that none of those things will be happening, and it doesn't mean you love your niblings any less.\n\nOthers have also made very valid points about other places that don't allow children.", "NTA.
