Green Lane, like all of the streets in our neighborhood, is a public street, maintained by the city. I\u2019m always careful to drive the speed limit or slower on Green Lane because a lot of kids play out in the street, usually unattended, and I\u2019ve seen kids as young as 3 or 4 out there without an adult in sight.\n\n\rA few weeks ago I noticed someone started putting two cones in Green Lane, one in the middle of eastbound lane, one in the middle of the westbound lane, lined up, so that cars have to straddle the center line, and if two cars are coming in opposite directions, they have to take turns. I posted on the neighborhood social media page recommending that whoever was putting the cones there might want to stop, because I had informed the city, who would probably confiscate the cones. I was actually bluffing, I hadn\u2019t called the city, just wanted people to stop blocking Green Lane. I got several snippy responses from people on Green Lane accusing me of not being a good neighbor, that instead of being \u201cpassive-aggressive\u201d I could have just knocked on the doors the cones were in front of and talked to them, and they could have explained why the cones were necessary \u2013 that too many people like me were using \u201ctheir\u201d street as a \u201ccut-through\u201d, so it wasn\u2019t safe for their children.

I got responses back that kids need to be playing outside, it\u2019s better than them being inside. I responded by noting that all the houses in our neighborhood have huge front and back yards, plus there is a private park in the center of our neighborhood, and I was always raised not to play in the street. I got the response \u201cthe cones will stay.\u201d\n\n\rSo, I decided to actually call the city and report the traffic obstruction, and since I now knew the name and address of the owner of the cones, I provided that information in my report. A city inspector came out in a week, issued a warning to the owners of the cones and told them he would be coming back by to ensure compliance. I haven\u2019t seen the cones since.\n\n\rMy wife is pissed at me for pissing off these neighbors, afraid it will give us a bad reputation in the neighborhood. While I\u2019ve now decided simply filing the report will be the way to go in a similar situation in the future so people won\u2019t know who did it, I don\u2019t think I was an AH for trying to give them a warning before reporting them.

It\u2019s great you try to be careful but those cones are aimed at the public generally not you specifically. Not everyone is as careful a driver so you should see this as some parents attempting to make the street safer for kids in the face of increased road traffic. Again they don\u2019t have a legal right to control the road but their actions are well intentioned. You\u2019re maybe technically on the right side of things, but is it really so important to you you\u2019d rather make the street less safe for children because of your personal annoyance? Sure kids can play in their backyards, but really what you\u2019re suggesting is to limit the space kids can play because you don\u2019t like these cones. Your wife is right that you\u2019re building s bad reputation for yourselves.

Like a street that is mostly for the people who live on that street becoming a through fare.

I\u2019m not arguing over a legal right to the road\u2014 in fact I\u2019m clear the people putting cones out don\u2019t have a legal right \u2014 but in the real world these are the considerations people have", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to do that consciously, just noting the impact of his suggestion", "I think people are overreacting here.

Im not saying it\u2019s illegal or even that he shouldn\u2019t do it. He\u2019s welcome to use it in that way. Where it becomes bad is reporting others for trying to make their street safer in the face of increased traffic. He\u2019s contributing to a growing problem even if he isn\u2019t technically doing anything wrong. I grew up on a street like this, mostly the only people on it were people using it to get home, but every now and then it\u2019d be used by people trying to avoid lights by cutting through the neighborhood using streets like these. Everyone has a right to do this but it does make it less safe for kids playing outside. If people are putting out cones I think it\u2019s safe to assume people were starting to feel like more traffic was becoming a problem. So, imho, it\u2019s a bit assholish to see cones and report the people putting them out because it says \u201cmy priority is not having to slow down\u201d when I think better people have the priority of \u201clet\u2019s drive in a way where kids are less likely to be struck\u201d. People don\u2019t have the right to put cones out unilaterally, hence the ESH rating.

My neighborhood is a fairly small one, bounded by two busy streets, one on the north, one on the west. There are three entrances on the north side, and three on the west side. When the city redid the north street, the contractor screwed up and made it so that you could no longer turn left into the neighborhood on the westernmost entrance from the north street. So the only option is to enter through one of the two easternmost entrances on the north side, or go all the way to the western boundary street, turn into one of those intersections, and then backtrack eastward through the neighborhood. The busy street on the west boundary of the neighborhood gets extremely backed up during afternoon rush hour. After turning southbound on the western boundary street, I'd crawl along in stop and go traffic before getting to one of the entrances, and then have to wait a long time to get a break in northbound traffic to be able to take the left turn into the neighborhood. It would add as much as 10-15 minutes to my commute, and all the time I would be close enough to my house that if I just left my car on the road and walked, I could be home in less than 5 minutes.

The cone heads are likely creating a greater hazard in the neighborhood, traffic downstream of a single traffic calming device is often FASTER than it would be otherwise as people speed up once they get past it.

These cones won't show up on any maps service and the obstruction of traffic may cause people to drive more erratically to avoid hitting traffic coming from the opposite direction. You may be the asshole for getting yourself and your wife dragged into a very visible neighborhood squabble. They're the asshole if they assume it was you who reported them (even if it was) since really anyone could have seen your comments and reported them.", "NTA\n\nWe have a somewhat similar situation near me but unfortunately the county authorities are part of the problem.\n\nI'm in a rural area 20 minutes outside of a moderate Midwest city.\n\nThe state high way connecting me to the city is currently closed to replace a bridge that goes over a small creek.\n\nLast week the fastest back road to bypass that bridge was closed by the county highway department.\n\nEveryone is pissed and no one is entirely sure WHY it was closed.\n\nSo far the rumors are:\n\n1. Because it's a gravel road.... Every single local here grew up driving on gravel.\n\n2. Out of town semis kept ignoring the official detour and following locals down it.... Okay, post the weight limit and start ticketing the trucks doing it.\n\n3.  The rich people in the fancy subdivision near it complained about the dust caused by the traffic.", "You're not an asshole, but you're not very smart either. Your wife is right that you just killed your social reputation in your neighborhood. This is something that easily could have been done anonymously, but because you absolutely *had* to fight about it, you've now got a target on your back.", "I grew up on a cul-de-sac.  Those aren't all that safe either.  Somebody's always always getting lost and turning around.", "NTA. Just so you know though, people will know I'm the future it IS you, even if you don't tell them.", "YTA ESH especially you", "I hope you learned, next time something happens shut up and just report it, no need to expose yourself. \n\nNta", "I'm surprised no one's talking about how neighbors are letting small children play outside without supervision. That borders on neglect.\n\nDef NTA", "Nta ! It\u2019s a public street, I don\u2019t know anywhere that allows random homeowners to put cones in the street bc of \u201ctraffic\u201d like what \u2026 and if it wasn\u2019t you \u2026. Someone else was gonna call and report it .", "Nta maybe the parents should actually supervise they\u2019re children then it wouldn\u2019t be a problem", "NTA. There are other, legal solutions like a slow children sign. Or kids staying out of the street. Your only misstep was maybe the social media argument, since now the report is clearly from you. Why should you go out of your way to avoid pissing off neighbors who are already being rude?"]}
