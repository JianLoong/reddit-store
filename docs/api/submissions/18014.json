{"id": 18014, "submission_id": "13puhbu", "title": "AITA for reporting someone in my neighborhood for blocking the road?", "selftext": "I live on the west side of my neighborhood, and coming home from work it\u2019s fastest for me to enter the neighborhood on the east side and drive down an east-west street in the neighborhood, let\u2019s call it Green Lane. Green Lane, like all of the streets in our neighborhood, is a public street, maintained by the city. I\u2019m always careful to drive the speed limit or slower on Green Lane because a lot of kids play out in the street, usually unattended, and I\u2019ve seen kids as young as 3 or 4 out there without an adult in sight.\n\n\rA few weeks ago I noticed someone started putting two cones in Green Lane, one in the middle of eastbound lane, one in the middle of the westbound lane, lined up, so that cars have to straddle the center line, and if two cars are coming in opposite directions, they have to take turns. I posted on the neighborhood social media page recommending that whoever was putting the cones there might want to stop, because I had informed the city, who would probably confiscate the cones. I was actually bluffing, I hadn\u2019t called the city, just wanted people to stop blocking Green Lane. I got several snippy responses from people on Green Lane accusing me of not being a good neighbor, that instead of being \u201cpassive-aggressive\u201d I could have just knocked on the doors the cones were in front of and talked to them, and they could have explained why the cones were necessary \u2013 that too many people like me were using \u201ctheir\u201d street as a \u201ccut-through\u201d, so it wasn\u2019t safe for their children. They even claimed to have asked a constable\u2019s deputy and gotten his unofficial blessing to put the cones out. \r  \nI responded that I am not using the street as a \u201ccut-through\u201d, I am using it as a city street, which is what it is, and the constable\u2019s deputy was mistaken, quoted the state law and city ordinance that both forbid people obstructing public streets without a permit from local authorities. I got responses back that kids need to be playing outside, it\u2019s better than them being inside. I responded by noting that all the houses in our neighborhood have huge front and back yards, plus there is a private park in the center of our neighborhood, and I was always raised not to play in the street. I got the response \u201cthe cones will stay.\u201d\n\n\rSo, I decided to actually call the city and report the traffic obstruction, and since I now knew the name and address of the owner of the cones, I provided that information in my report. A city inspector came out in a week, issued a warning to the owners of the cones and told them he would be coming back by to ensure compliance. I haven\u2019t seen the cones since.\n\n\rMy wife is pissed at me for pissing off these neighbors, afraid it will give us a bad reputation in the neighborhood. While I\u2019ve now decided simply filing the report will be the way to go in a similar situation in the future so people won\u2019t know who did it, I don\u2019t think I was an AH for trying to give them a warning before reporting them.

You should have just contacted the authorities. What they were doing created a public safety hazard.", "NTA", "NTA. That's incredibly unsafe as it causes drivers to swerve/move in an unpredictable manner. They have a whole yard and if they need more than that then the parents should be taking them to a park or YMCA.", "NTA kids shouldn\u2019t be playing in the street if there is a park nearby and it\u2019s a busy street", "I would start honking every time I drove by, but I might actually be an AH.", "\nOuch\n\nMight be time for you to MOVE from this unfair illogical unwelcoming \"neighborhood\"\n\n\nSome folks always giving themselves permission to invade question undermine stifle etc we Workers,\n\n\nPerhaps some counseling to help You and Wife to learn better communication teamwork happiness etc,\n\n\nI truly HATE the unhealthy wasteful noisy unfair oppressive car-culture car-alarms,, everyone MUST have and use cars to even be alive oppressions inflicted upon so much of earth,, especially in most of USA,\n\n\nWe are truly needing much more fast affordable mass-transit trains busses subway-systems etc,, \n\n\nSo I guess you getting the NTA rating from me;; but NOT your \"neighbors\"\n\nAnd you still needing to MOVE", "ESH. Those people don\u2019t have a right to control the street, but they\u2019re clearly right when they say people are using it as a cut through (you yourself laughably admit to using it that way, but at the same time say you\u2019re just using it as a street as if that\u2019s a winning argument \u2014 guess what they know it\u2019s a street too) and are concerned about kids playing. It\u2019s great you try to be careful but those cones are aimed at the public generally not you specifically. Not everyone is as careful a driver so you should see this as some parents attempting to make the street safer for kids in the face of increased road traffic. Again they don\u2019t have a legal right to control the road but their actions are well intentioned. You\u2019re maybe technically on the right side of things, but is it really so important to you you\u2019d rather make the street less safe for children because of your personal annoyance? Sure kids can play in their backyards, but really what you\u2019re suggesting is to limit the space kids can play because you don\u2019t like these cones. Your wife is right that you\u2019re building s bad reputation for yourselves. Good advice is to not think about who is technically in the right, but rather who has good intention and how can you, as neighbors, find good outcomes. So far you\u2019re not acting neighborly.", "NTA Unless it's a privately owned street, they have no right to block it off.", "Wtf is going to go knocking on doors to ask wh put cones in the street? NTA", "NTA. Where I used to live those cones would have been gone in like fifteen minutes. Now wether that was from them being nicked or the local government confiscating them would be 50/50.", "I give OP and everyone else credit for not just either knocking the cones down with their car or getting out, picking up the cones and sticking them in the middle of a random driveway.\n\nYour street isn't only there so you can drive to your house. It's there so everyone else can drive to their homes.", "Yep, and it sounds like the coneheads weren\u2019t saying that they were willing to compromise, it would have been all about them TELLING him that their reasons were sound and the cones weren\u2019t going anywhere. Only thing I can fault OP for is bothering to give a heads up, he should have just called the city right away, kept it anonymous.", "I mean, OP is NTA. But this is kind of an odd take.\n\nFrom the other guy's point of view OP just doubled down on his \"bad\" behavior. Again, that guy is wrong. But your little quote fits the opposite side of this story too.", "Yeah, I\u2019m getting a major sense of entitlement from the parents. Plenty of kids grow up on busy streets where coning the street off to slow traffic would not be an option. Parents just know they can\u2019t let their kids play outside by themselves until they are old enough to know how to ply safely around the street, what to do if a ball goes out into the street, etc. sounds like these parents are just too lazy to parent their kids, to supervise them and teach them to be street safe, so expect other people to look out for their kids for them.", "Aw there are entitled AHs all over. Moving would just get PP away from these AHs, but chances are there would just be different AHs in his new neighborhood.", "> using it as a cut through\n\nThis is *horribly* problematic language. Roads are roads are roads. All that matters is that the driver gets where they're going. **The _choice of route_ is up to them**.", "technically right is the best kind of right? I don't think he's \"trying to limit the space kids can play\". Kids don't need to play in the street. Period.", "I\u2019d like to know just what your definition of using a street as a \u201ccut-through\u201d is. There is an implication of a somehow less legitimate claim to the use of the street than the people who live on the street have. That\u2019s not how public streets work. Except for dead end streets, every public street is a way to get from one place to another, with no restriction on what the final destination is. But let\u2019s give the cone parents the benefit of agenerous definition of using a street as a \u201ccut-through,\u201d that would be people who don\u2019t live in the neighborhood traveling through the neighborhood to get from an origin outside the neighborhood to a destination outside the neighborhood. OP isn\u2019t doing that, his destination is his house in the neighborhood, and the street he\u2019s taking gets him there. That is NOT using the street as a cut through. \n\nAnd OP is not trying to limit the space the kids can play in, they can still play anywhere they want as long as they look out for cars and get out of the way before the cars get to them. It is the vine heads who are trying to limit the space where people drive, and illegally so. OP is NTA.", "I know what you\u2019re going through I have someone who spray painted a baseball bases & home plate on our very busy road , which isn\u2019t allowed & puts up cones to block part of the road", "Possibly\n\nBut staying means that folks get Entrenched, emotional, big bully stalker AH \n\n\nSo moving to a more quiet orderly place is still the best idea\n\n\nUnless someone has a Better idea", "Doesn't OP live in this neighborhood?

As long as he is obeying posted speed limits and paying attention to the road there is no issue here.", "I mean that\u2019s some cool intention you\u2019re putting behind your words and all, but not all roads are equal. Idk how much you know about city planning, but often as populations grow roads that once were used for one purpose take on new purposes. Like a street that is mostly for the people who live on that street becoming a through fare. That\u2019s my read on what\u2019s happening here, a street is changing, and there\u2019s tension about it. I\u2019m not arguing over a legal right to the road\u2014 in fact I\u2019m clear the people putting cones out don\u2019t have a legal right \u2014 but in the real world these are the considerations people have", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to do that consciously, just noting the impact of his suggestion", "I think people are overreacting here. Without more info about the street itself we\u2019re left to assumptions, but based on how OP described it, sounded like a residential street he is using to more efficiently get home. Im not saying it\u2019s illegal or even that he shouldn\u2019t do it. He\u2019s welcome to use it in that way. Where it becomes bad is reporting others for trying to make their street safer in the face of increased traffic. He\u2019s contributing to a growing problem even if he isn\u2019t technically doing anything wrong. I grew up on a street like this, mostly the only people on it were people using it to get home, but every now and then it\u2019d be used by people trying to avoid lights by cutting through the neighborhood using streets like these. Everyone has a right to do this but it does make it less safe for kids playing outside. If people are putting out cones I think it\u2019s safe to assume people were starting to feel like more traffic was becoming a problem. So, imho, it\u2019s a bit assholish to see cones and report the people putting them out because it says \u201cmy priority is not having to slow down\u201d when I think better people have the priority of \u201clet\u2019s drive in a way where kids are less likely to be struck\u201d. People don\u2019t have the right to put cones out unilaterally, hence the ESH rating. But if your instinct is I\u2019m technically right therefore these parents safety concerns can fuck off, than sorry but you\u2019re acting like an asshole too", "He\u2019s not the one who created an impact, people were using the street as a street before the cone heads decided to illegally obstruct it, they\u2019re the ones who created the impact, OP just alerted the city to the illegal obstruction so the city could reverse that impact and return the street to its intended use as a street, not a playground.", "The 3000 character limit kept me from fully describing the geography. My neighborhood is a fairly small one, bounded by two busy streets, one on the north, one on the west. There are three entrances on the north side, and three on the west side. When the city redid the north street, the contractor screwed up and made it so that you could no longer turn left into the neighborhood on the westernmost entrance from the north street. So the only option is to enter through one of the two easternmost entrances on the north side, or go all the way to the western boundary street, turn into one of those intersections, and then backtrack eastward through the neighborhood. The busy street on the west boundary of the neighborhood gets extremely backed up during afternoon rush hour. After turning southbound on the western boundary street, I'd crawl along in stop and go traffic before getting to one of the entrances, and then have to wait a long time to get a break in northbound traffic to be able to take the left turn into the neighborhood. It would add as much as 10-15 minutes to my commute, and all the time I would be close enough to my house that if I just left my car on the road and walked, I could be home in less than 5 minutes. And whether I am coming from the north or the west, I am still having to drive through other peoples' streets to get to my house, because my street doesn't go all the way to either one of the main boundary streets.", "It\u2019s 100% clear he\u2019s not cutting through a neighborhood, he\u2019s driving through HIS neighborhood to his house in HIS neighborhood. \n\nAnd you obviously have no idea how traffic engineering works, traffic engineers do traffic studies before making changes including adding traffic calming devices (which is essentially what the cone heads are trying to do) because traffic calming done the wrong way or on the wrong place can actually create MORE dangerous conditions. The cone heads are likely creating a greater hazard in the neighborhood, traffic downstream of a single traffic calming device is often FASTER than it would be otherwise as people speed up once they get past it. OP alerting the city to the obstruction may have prevented a more serious problem elsewhere, and did way more to alert the city to a possible need for a look at traffic patterns in this neighborhood than the cone heads just trying to take matters into their own hands did. \n\nAnd OP had said he makes sure to drive the speed limit or slower because he knows kids are out there, so your comment about it being \u201cassholish to see cones and report the people putting them out because it says \u2018my priority is not having to slow down\u2019\u201d is completely uncalled for. Your position is completely untenable and the more you try to shore it up, the bigger hole you\u2019re digging for yourself."]}
