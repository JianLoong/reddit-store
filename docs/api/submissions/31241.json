After Alyssa says her room #,I give mine. The RA immediately responds \u201cbullshit\u201d. Eventually, he looks at my name and sees I told the truth. As we\u2019re back to my room together I say to the RA \u201cover here talking about some \u2018bullshit\u2019. Why would I lie, anyways? You think you\u2019re important enough to lie to?\u201d He doesn\u2019t have a response.

Kids lie all the time about their room, or the room of the person they\u2019re visiting. I would only call bullshit if I was CERTAIN that it was bullshit (the room number doesn\u2019t exist, the room is a female room when they\u2019re male or they\u2019ve given me a male name). Given how rude OP was throughout the rest of the interaction, my guess is that he gave his room number in a way that sounded like he could have been lying. It\u2019s hard to explain in text. RA still shouldn\u2019t have called bullshit out loud and instead checked the name to confirm. \n\nOne time I had to get a kid\u2019s address and he was giving me a hard time about something already.

That argument is like saying cops are conditioned to deal with dangerous criminals so they should use excessive force at all times. (Eng is 2nd language, just trying to show how ridiculous that sounds)", "So he can be a fucker n not get a trouble but op can? Lame", "OP is 22. Are you assuming he\u2019s as BYU or something?", "This sounds like a practice at deception. You sound like you're race baiting or something here and trying to actively stir up trouble. Kids lie and this RA knows it. They are looking out for younger people and must see a LOT of mischief going on at all times. They were probably trying to call her bluff and she proved her self telling the truth. Ampang it up is only going to cause more trouble in their dorm. Go elsewhere troublemaker.", "OP is the one who needs to get her feelings in check. She hugely overreacted.", "The same people downvoting are the same ones screeching over Oat milk being out at Starbucks. SMH", "Or it makes other people think you\u2019re overreactive and behaving like an asshole, just like OP\u2019s friend is probably thinking about them.", "College kids lie bud all he did was not believe him at a glance and please don't equate college kids being told no to racial police violence I promise it's not the same", "Well you don\u2019t need to dial it up to 100 like OP lol"]}
