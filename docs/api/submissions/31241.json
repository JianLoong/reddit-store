That's just me speculating.", "Don't justify his BS,  this was a completely disproportionate reaction, there are no excuses for this behaviour towards this person.

Was holding a lit blunt in his hand. \n\n2) not drinking underage. Was standing with half a handle of Jack that had been attached to his face when we found him. Was also in a dry dorm at the time. \n\n3) not having a pet visiting. The shower was meowing. \n\n4) hadn't lost his keys at checkout. Could not provide keys to finish checkout. \n\n5) lived in my room.

I worked campus security years back and I remember asking a group of students for their student ID numbers (I can't remember anymore exactly what they were doing but a complaint had been called in about it). Each of their responses was \"12345\" and they laughed (apparently not realizing I could look up their ID numbers and that they'd get into even more trouble for lying).\n\nSo you can either be gullible and buy into it when someone feeds you a number that sounds suspicious, or you can trust your gut and OCCASIONALLY be wrong (when some kid's number really is 12345).", "The worst thing the RA did was say \"bullshit\".
