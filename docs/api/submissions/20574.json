She called me just about ever name you can imagine today when I called him out.", "Highly unlikely. Especially without a prescription and SERIOUS medical documentation showing that they've tried dozens of other things and nothing worked. THC for kids is incredibly controversial even in areas where there's some medical evidence for it (i.e. seizures), because it's not just a medication, it literally involves getting kids high. There's no way it's legal to just give it to a child not under doctor's orders, and most doctors wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole because of the controversies.", "Have him drug tested at a hospital. Your kid, I mean. Explain the 'shy meds' and what they have admitted. Drs/nurses are mandated reporters, and as long as they aren't prescribed, they will write up what you need to show a judge to help terminate his parental rights. Many people think the is a good way to dial down autistic children. But a Dr reporting it and you reporting it is not the same thing and leaves a different type of paper trail"]}
