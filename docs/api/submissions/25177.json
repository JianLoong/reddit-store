We both work full-time and have the kids in daycare during the summer until school starts up again.  We both make decent money, but with the cost of literally everything going up more and more often, our budget is getting tighter.  We still live comfortably within our means, but we are saving much less and are being more conscious of our discretionary spending.\n\nOur youngest is starting kindergarten this fall, so that will help because we aren't spending on daycare anymore.  But our oldest kids are now in more sport and extracurricular activities which pretty much offset any saving we would be doing on childcare.  We aren't anywhere near struggling, but we are definitely more aware of how we spend our money now.\n\nMy wife's younger sister, Jen (30F), is 6 months pregnant with her 3rd child.  Jen is not married and this is her 3rd different baby daddy.  Only one of the first 2 fathers is involved, the other is a complete deadbeat who regularly skips child support payments.  Jen recently called my wife and told her that her current baby's dad left her and she's freaking out and asking for help.  Whether that be money, a place to stay, anything.\n\nMy wife's parents are both passed away and they have no other siblings, just each other.  So, obviously my wife wants to do whatever we can to help.  But, we don't have the space to house them and don't have a lot of extra money to give them either.  My wife wants to give Jen a few hundred dollars every month and to start watching her 2 older kids so Jen can keep working.  Personally, I think that idea is short-sighted because Jen won't be able to work after the new baby comes.\n\nMy idea was to dip into savings and pay for a lawyer for Jen to do a better job of getting the child support she is owed.  I would rather bite a bigger bullet once than death by a thousand cuts over months and months.  But my wife says that won't help put food on Jen's table every week.\n\nI laid out our budget and asked my wife where we can make cuts to support Jen, because I just don't see it.  I asked her what she would be willing to give up, or have our kids go without, to support Jen.  She got mad at me and called me heartless for not wanting to help.  It turned into a fight and I ended up telling her that if she wants to support her sister like this, then she is going to need to work more or get a 2nd job because I'm not compromising our family budget long-term.\n\nAll of our finances are shared, so it's not like either of us has our \"own\" money to use however we want.  I also know that my wife and I are the only family Jen has and I agree that we should help.  But adding hundreds or possibly more to our monthly budget isn't going to work.

There's a reason she's feels it's her (and de facto, your) responsibility to help her sister, despite rationally knowing it's to the detriment of her own marriage and family. Keep showing your wife resources, listed below, that the sister can then utilize, repeat as necessary.\n\nFor you: I'd keep offering the cost of an attorney to pursue child support, and maybe go as far as to find a list of 3 that litigate family law and give to your wife to pass along.. Explain to your wife that your willingness to help your SIL is solely based on whether or not and how fast she (SIL) pursues that. The baby daddy needs to pay before you cut anything from your household, especially activities for your own children. I'd make sure the nephews don't miss milestones due to finances (birthdays, etc), it's not their fault. Reassure your wife that the decisions her sister have made are her own, and there are consequences. Include the nephews in low cost activities-museums, parks, free community events.\n\nFor your children: they will sense something is upsetting their Mom,cand you. Don't ignore the elephant in the room. Keep it simple and say, age appropriately, 'We're trying to figure out the best way to help your Aunt. If they seem interested/empathetic (not saying that's required) maybe have them pick out a toy for their cousins.\n\nHere's a list of resources for the sister to explore, your wife can point her in the right direction (lead a horse to water), but ultimately the sister needs to pursue:\n\nCall 211, they have an extensive list of agencies they can direct her to.\nTANF-Temporary aid to needy families, there are 2 ways they help, Emergency situations, and Diversionary assistance.\nWIC-pays for certain grocery items and formula \nFood banks \nDiaper banks, childrens clothing banks.\nUtility assistance-most of these are one-time and must already have a past due bill.\nEducation-SIL needs a job training program to get a higher income so she can take care of her children. She needs to apply for grants and any job training programs that can be found. This is the only exception I would make to caring for her children, while she's attending class.\n\nFor you SIL:  her life is gonna suck for her for a long time, either if she chooses to fix her situation or not. Encourage/celebrate small successes, even those as small as making a phone call to dig herself out of this mess. Her fun is over. It's her choice now whether to pull herself out of dysfunction or not. She needs semi-permanent  birth control, post haste. She doesn't seem like she's responsible enough to take a pill everyday, or insist on condoms.
