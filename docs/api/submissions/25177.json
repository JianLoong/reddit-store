We both work full-time and have the kids in daycare during the summer until school starts up again.  We both make decent money, but with the cost of literally everything going up more and more often, our budget is getting tighter.  We still live comfortably within our means, but we are saving much less and are being more conscious of our discretionary spending.\n\nOur youngest is starting kindergarten this fall, so that will help because we aren't spending on daycare anymore.  But our oldest kids are now in more sport and extracurricular activities which pretty much offset any saving we would be doing on childcare.  We aren't anywhere near struggling, but we are definitely more aware of how we spend our money now.\n\nMy wife's younger sister, Jen (30F), is 6 months pregnant with her 3rd child.  Jen is not married and this is her 3rd different baby daddy.  Only one of the first 2 fathers is involved, the other is a complete deadbeat who regularly skips child support payments.  Jen recently called my wife and told her that her current baby's dad left her and she's freaking out and asking for help.  Whether that be money, a place to stay, anything.\n\nMy wife's parents are both passed away and they have no other siblings, just each other.  So, obviously my wife wants to do whatever we can to help.  But, we don't have the space to house them and don't have a lot of extra money to give them either.  My wife wants to give Jen a few hundred dollars every month and to start watching her 2 older kids so Jen can keep working.  Personally, I think that idea is short-sighted because Jen won't be able to work after the new baby comes.\n\nMy idea was to dip into savings and pay for a lawyer for Jen to do a better job of getting the child support she is owed.  I would rather bite a bigger bullet once than death by a thousand cuts over months and months.  But my wife says that won't help put food on Jen's table every week.\n\nI laid out our budget and asked my wife where we can make cuts to support Jen, because I just don't see it.  I asked her what she would be willing to give up, or have our kids go without, to support Jen.  She got mad at me and called me heartless for not wanting to help.  It turned into a fight and I ended up telling her that if she wants to support her sister like this, then she is going to need to work more or get a 2nd job because I'm not compromising our family budget long-term.\n\nAll of our finances are shared, so it's not like either of us has our \"own\" money to use however we want.  I also know that my wife and I are the only family Jen has and I agree that we should help.  But adding hundreds or possibly more to our monthly budget isn't going to work.  Jen needs more help than we can provide and she needs to find resources that can do that for her.  But my wife thinks I am being an uncaring AH about this.", "created_utc": 1692628803, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x9kvz/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_work_more_if_she/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is one of those cases where just giving her some monthly help will never solve the problem.

The cold, hard truth is that you don\u2019t have the financial bandwidth to send several hundred dollars a month to her sister without either going into debt, penalizing your children by taking things away from them or compromising your future.  This does not make you uncaring.  What it makes you is a man who prioritizes his immediate family first.  It\u2019s not about not wanting to help. It\u2019s about understanding the limitations of your own financial situation.  \n\nIf she wants to help her sister, she\u2019s going to need to increase that bandwidth.

Yes, your sister-in-law needs help but yes, you need to be sensible in the long-term.

You're not a jerk for wanting to stick to s budget, she's not a jerk for wanting to help. Honestly getting a lawyer isn't going to help anyone though because folks have too many ways to avoid child support. They'll even quit working to aviod paying. You'd be better served spending the savings on a 1 time gift to your SIL.

It's a virtual certainty that over the next decade, the prices of basic necessities will continue going up faster than salaries.  \n\nIf OP's wife can't point to any possible budget  cuts today, what are the chances that supporting the sister and 3 kids will ever get any easier for OP's family? Plus, once the support starts, cutting her off will be virtually impossible.  \n\nOP, for yoir kids' sake, this would be the hill I die on.  If your wife wants to send money, especially *monthly*, then she needs to do 2 things.  First, tell you where the budget cuts are coming from? Is Timmy done with soccer? Is the family no longer eating meat? Will you stop saving for retirement? \n\nSecond, your wife needs to acknowledge that if the budget gets tighter in the future, it's up to her to make and take blame for future cuts with the kids. \n\nBut above all, do not let your wife put you into credit card debt for this.

The way you acted made you the scapegoat, it's not the financial situation that stop her from helping her sister it's you.\n\nYes logically you are not at fault, but news flash people are emotional when their family is in trouble.
