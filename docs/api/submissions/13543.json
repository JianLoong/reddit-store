When my parents asked and I explained that Peter made both sandwiches by himself, they called me a liar and said that I had \u201cmanipulated\u201d Peter into agreeing that he made them.

I'm curious why Peter hasn't spoken up for himself, though. Does he want to continue being dependent on your parents? Has he ever expressed a desire to do the things his siblings do (i.e., go to college, raise a family, etc)?", "What Peter thinks about all of that? \n\nNTA and the angry family can take care of him if they think he needs it. I think at least you should try to free your brother from your parents. He is a victim here because his autonomy is being robbed.\n\nYour parents need to have their heads looked up. That sounds like a form of M\u00fcnchhausen.", "NTA.

Your parents have some insane psychological issues for sure.\n\nedited to add: Even if your brother is autistic, that doesn't mean he's incapable of living an independent life. There are so many autistic people that function within society without the need for any sort of parental or sibling intervention. Youre parents are *nuts*.", "NTA.\n\nI hope this is fake, because it's so sad. If you really are in this situation OP, get as far away from your parents as possible and go NC. because 1 of 2 things is happening.\n\n1) Peter is autistic, but they never had him tested or explored treatment. They neglected their child's illness for 23 years. I can only imagine how they neglected their other children. Thus they are shitty parents.\n\n2) They are so abusive that they treated their son like he had autism for the attention they would get from other people. There's a name for this it's Munchausen's by proxy. If they did that to their son for 23 years, I can only imagine how emotionally abusive they were to their other children. \n\nPeter is 27, does he have his own health insurance? Can he go get tested on his own? Can you take him?", "NTA so much.\n\nAlso gonna get this off my chest: People who think someone who is autistic can't live a full and normal life are the absolute worst. \n\nI have Asbergers. Unless it's a very specific situation you would never even know I had autism when you interacted with me. I have a very well paying job, my own house and basically have \"Succeeded\" in life at this point (I'm 29).\n\nIt's called a spectrum for a reason. You get cases like mine where it's so mild that it becomes a giant question of if said person is actually on the spectrum. All the way to people who have severe complications from autism and it is debilitating.\n\nPermanently damaging someones life becuese he might be on the spectrum is so fucking horrible to me. And it's the might part that is enraging me. Peter very well could not be on the spectrum and your parents have irreparably damaged his life at this point.", "NTA. I have a question though. What does Peter say about all this? Can you make him getting a screening (with both you and your parents present) as a condition to you agreeing to take care of him? Your parents may just simply refuse to believe the results though.", "NTA. I'm 35, and autistic, and this fucking breaks my heart. What your parents have done, and continue to do, to Peter is reprehensible. He is clearly capable. He seems to have expressed a desire for autonomy repeatedly throughout his life. They are ABUSING him.\n\nIs there any possibility he could move in with you in the short- to medium-term so you could help him get established, and then live on his own? The longer this goes on, the worse it's going to be for him, and it's already done potentially irreparable damage to him. And fuck your parents, I am livid at how they have infantilised and smothered him.", "If Peter was my brother, I'd organise an appointment to get him formally diagnosed (or undiagnosed). I'd organise some specific therapy, also - whether he has autism or not, he's been raised to think of himself an incapable which will require some help to get over. \n\nEven if he does have autism - the goal for any parent is to enable their children to become independent and capable. To teach them useful skills which they can apply themselves. To have them be responsible for themselves. I've seen parents achieve this with kids who have Downs Syndrome, ASD, cognitive or learning impairments etc. \n\nYou may not want the responsibility of caring for him when your parents are no longer around which is fair...but you can help in other ways. As the person who is seemingly thinking clearly and can see that your parents are behaving in a way that is contrary to Peter's development, steer him in the right direction, accompany him to places where he can get the right advice. \n\nIn your shoes, I wouldn't even be considering my parents - I'd grab my brother and do what's necessary.", "YTA this makes no damn sense to me Peter is a grown ass man take him to a doctor and let him get a diagnosis. \n\nHow have you and your siblings allowed this to go on for long. As soon as he turned 18 you and your siblings should have planned a exit strategy for Peter or at the very least called CPS. \n\nStop being Such an asshole and help your brother", "Your parents have done reprehensible harm to Peter by choosing to believe what they call a \"diagnosis\" without actually getting him medically evaluated for Autism just because a family friend pitched it to them without any type of testing to confirm it. If they felt they had a reason to have him tested for Autism, they had an obligation while he was younger to get him properly tested & research/investigate all the resources they may need. All they have proceeded to do is put a veil over Peter his entire life that kept him from figuring out life on his own & teaching him the life skills he needed so him & his needs are completely dependent on the actions of others. Not to say that Peter isn't on the spectrum, but without legitimate testing they are severe hypochondriacs who self diagnosed their son without any proof to back up their claims. \n\nSecondly, Autism is a wide spectrum. My son is 11 & was diagnosed medically when he was nearly 5 (we spent 2 years waiting for the proper doctors who would be able to provide us with the diagnosis). While I can say that since around 2 years old, we suspected he was on the ASD, we gave & have continued to give him all the life skills he needs to live a successful, happy life. Every person on the spectrum is different. Some are able to be completely independent & some need more assistance like my son. But my son at 11 is a very independent boy who does everything for himself. We taught him from a very young age how to care for himself, take care of his basic needs as well as other life stuff like cleaning, washing laundry (you get the idea.) We are there to help if he needs us, but we would be doing him a disservice & disrespecting his intelligence if we didn't teach him & kept him completely dependent on us for even some of his smallest basic needs.\n\nOP, you're NTA & if you're concerned about your parents & Peter I would seriously consider stepping in to determine what help you can provide both your parents & Peter moving forward. It's never too late to seek medical & professional help for Peter. Getting him diagnosed is the first thing that should be done.", "NTA, but you really need to get Peter out if there. Does he have a high school diploma? Any university? Any job experience at all?\n\nIt\u2019s high past time you find a lawyer for Peter to help him get out of this. They have ruined his entire life.", "You have a bigger problem. Your brother is getting abused and you need to get him out. I'm being serious. He has lost all his bodily autonomy, all his agency. He isn't allowed to do anything in life others are. He isn't being coddled. He is actively being harmed.", "Er, NTA on not wanting to be a caretaker, but YTA for not helping Peter get out of this situation. Seriously, you're just leaving him stuck like this?\n\nIf he's as capable as you say he is, then he doesn't need a caretaker. That's moot. All he needs is someone to help him out of this hole his parents have dug.", "NTA even if Peter IS autistic, he's not your problem and you're well within your rights to say no.", "Why are so dispassionate about your parents abusing your brother for the majority of his life? People have been arrested and had their children taken away for this behavior. \n\nYou and Peter are both adults now, for f\u2019s sake help him get away from these completely insane ppl and cut them out of both of your lives.\n\nThat\u2019s why you are an AH. Health insurance is not worth being psychologically tortured. And yes, forced infantilization is torture.", "NTA, but I think a bit too much weight is getting put on the diagnosis/lack of a diagnosis in the post and the comments. Getting fully tested and diagnosed for autism is often a miserable and expensive process that can wreck someone's future. What people forget is that an official diagnosis severely limits your opportunities in a lot of areas of life. Not even mentioning the bias against diagnosing adults.\n\nThe issue, then, is that your parents are not treating your brother's situation with any nuance or respect whatsoever. There's a dominating view of autism that it just makes you completely functionless and incapable of staying alive by yourself, but this is almost never the case.\n\nEven if someone isn't diagnosed with something, you can still consider what **symptoms** they display, though. This is especially important with autism, since it's a pretty wide spectrum. Some people can mask in social situations really well, some people can't speak out loud, some don't like certain textures, some can't stand certain sounds, some hate both, some get angry when overstimulated, some shut down completely, some follow a rigid schedule that can actually help them in a job and daily life, some have trouble staying on a schedule at all, etc. \n\nGetting a grasp on these kinds of things are all way more important to help your brother than an actual diagnosis. Your parents are the assholes because they're not even attempting to do this; they just want to act like the disorder is fully synonymous with helplessness rather than actually learning about the complexities of your brother's life.\n\nEdit to add: And the key part here is that if your brother has these symptoms, it doesnt matter if he's diagnosed autistic. If your parents focused on visible symptoms, they could just help him in specific areas where he would need help regardless of his diagnosis, rather than smother him entirely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
