For privacy, I will refer to my youngest brother as \u201cPeter\u201d (27M.) When Peter was about four, a family friend told my parents that Peter might have autism (she said because her husband was a pediatrician and Peter reminded her of one of his autistic patients.) My parents have clung to that for years and insist to everyone that Peter is autistic. **They have never had Peter formally tested for autism.** Which is why I put autistic in quotation marks in the title. Part of me thinks that they just want Peter to have special needs so that they can always feel needed and depended on by at least one of their children.\n\nThey would insist that Peter was incapable of performing any chores or tasks, and still claim he\u2019s helpless. One time I said I was going to make a sandwich, and Peter told me \u201cHere, let me get it\u201d and made us both a sandwich. When my parents asked and I explained that Peter made both sandwiches by himself, they called me a liar and said that I had \u201cmanipulated\u201d Peter into agreeing that he made them. Peter\u2019s teachers would tell our parents that Peter was doing all these things on his own and was perfectly capable. Our parents would be in complete denial, accusing the entire school of lying and insisting Peter was helpless because of his never actually confirmed autism \u201cdiagnosis.\u201d\n\nMy mother was in a car accident and had to stay in the hospital for several weeks. Luckily, she has made a full recovery, but the accident gave my parents a reality check that anything can happen and that they don\u2019t know how long they will be around to look after Peter. They had me come to their house (they do not trust Peter to be home alone) and told me that when they passed away, they expected me to take care of Peter. (They did not ask my sister \u201cJuliet\u201d as her job requires her to live in a foreign country for most of the year. My brother \u201cNicholas\u201d has a medically needy son, so they said they could not ask him to look after Peter either.)\n\nI told my parents that I will not be taking care of Peter because he is perfectly capable of caring for himself. My parents called me selfish, insisted Peter was helpless, and started to bring up his never actually confirmed autism. I stood up to them by pointing out that Peter is perfectly capable of being an adult, they simply have refused to teach him. I told them that since they\u2019re the ones who want to keep Peter helpless then taking care of him is their responsibility.\n\nMy parents told other members of the family (my grandparents, uncle, and a family friend) about what I said, and they called me a massive asshole. (I don\u2019t think they understand how autism is diagnosed and that a family friend\u2019s suggestion from when Peter was four doesn\u2019t confirm he\u2019s autistic.)

Has he ever expressed a desire to do the things his siblings do (i.e., go to college, raise a family, etc)?", "What Peter thinks about all of that? \n\nNTA and the angry family can take care of him if they think he needs it. I think at least you should try to free your brother from your parents. He is a victim here because his autonomy is being robbed.\n\nYour parents need to have their heads looked up.

Your parents have some insane psychological issues for sure.\n\nedited to add: Even if your brother is autistic, that doesn't mean he's incapable of living an independent life. There are so many autistic people that function within society without the need for any sort of parental or sibling intervention. Youre parents are *nuts*.", "NTA.\n\nI hope this is fake, because it's so sad. If you really are in this situation OP, get as far away from your parents as possible and go NC. because 1 of 2 things is happening.\n\n1) Peter is autistic, but they never had him tested or explored treatment. They neglected their child's illness for 23 years. I can only imagine how they neglected their other children. Thus they are shitty parents.\n\n2) They are so abusive that they treated their son like he had autism for the attention they would get from other people. There's a name for this it's Munchausen's by proxy. If they did that to their son for 23 years, I can only imagine how emotionally abusive they were to their other children. \n\nPeter is 27, does he have his own health insurance? Can he go get tested on his own? Can you take him?", "NTA so much.\n\nAlso gonna get this off my chest: People who think someone who is autistic can't live a full and normal life are the absolute worst. \n\nI have Asbergers. Unless it's a very specific situation you would never even know I had autism when you interacted with me. I have a very well paying job, my own house and basically have \"Succeeded\" in life at this point (I'm 29).\n\nIt's called a spectrum for a reason. You get cases like mine where it's so mild that it becomes a giant question of if said person is actually on the spectrum. All the way to people who have severe complications from autism and it is debilitating.\n\nPermanently damaging someones life becuese he might be on the spectrum is so fucking horrible to me. And it's the might part that is enraging me. Peter very well could not be on the spectrum and your parents have irreparably damaged his life at this point.", "NTA. I have a question though. What does Peter say about all this? Can you make him getting a screening (with both you and your parents present) as a condition to you agreeing to take care of him? Your parents may just simply refuse to believe the results though.", "NTA. I'm 35, and autistic, and this fucking breaks my heart. What your parents have done, and continue to do, to Peter is reprehensible. He is clearly capable. He seems to have expressed a desire for autonomy repeatedly throughout his life. They are ABUSING him.\n\nIs there any possibility he could move in with you in the short- to medium-term so you could help him get established, and then live on his own? The longer this goes on, the worse it's going to be for him, and it's already done potentially irreparable damage to him. And fuck your parents, I am livid at how they have infantilised and smothered him.", "If Peter was my brother, I'd organise an appointment to get him formally diagnosed (or undiagnosed). I'd organise some specific therapy, also - whether he has autism or not, he's been raised to think of himself an incapable which will require some help to get over. \n\nEven if he does have autism - the goal for any parent is to enable their children to become independent and capable. To teach them useful skills which they can apply themselves. To have them be responsible for themselves. I've seen parents achieve this with kids who have Downs Syndrome, ASD, cognitive or learning impairments etc. \n\nYou may not want the responsibility of caring for him when your parents are no longer around which is fair...but you can help in other ways. As the person who is seemingly thinking clearly and can see that your parents are behaving in a way that is contrary to Peter's development, steer him in the right direction, accompany him to places where he can get the right advice. \n\nIn your shoes, I wouldn't even be considering my parents - I'd grab my brother and do what's necessary.", "YTA this makes no damn sense to me Peter is a grown ass man take him to a doctor and let him get a diagnosis. \n\nHow have you and your siblings allowed this to go on for long. As soon as he turned 18 you and your siblings should have planned a exit strategy for Peter or at the very least called CPS. \n\nStop being Such an asshole and help your brother", "Your parents have done reprehensible harm to Peter by choosing to believe what they call a \"diagnosis\" without actually getting him medically evaluated for Autism just because a family friend pitched it to them without any type of testing to confirm it. If they felt they had a reason to have him tested for Autism, they had an obligation while he was younger to get him properly tested & research/investigate all the resources they may need. All they have proceeded to do is put a veil over Peter his entire life that kept him from figuring out life on his own & teaching him the life skills he needed so him & his needs are completely dependent on the actions of others. Not to say that Peter isn't on the spectrum, but without legitimate testing they are severe hypochondriacs who self diagnosed their son without any proof to back up their claims. \n\nSecondly, Autism is a wide spectrum. My son is 11 & was diagnosed medically when he was nearly 5 (we spent 2 years waiting for the proper doctors who would be able to provide us with the diagnosis). While I can say that since around 2 years old, we suspected he was on the ASD, we gave & have continued to give him all the life skills he needs to live a successful, happy life. Every person on the spectrum is different. Some are able to be completely independent & some need more assistance like my son. But my son at 11 is a very independent boy who does everything for himself. We taught him from a very young age how to care for himself, take care of his basic needs as well as other life stuff like cleaning, washing laundry (you get the idea.) We are there to help if he needs us, but we would be doing him a disservice & disrespecting his intelligence if we didn't teach him & kept him completely dependent on us for even some of his smallest basic needs.\n\nOP, you're NTA & if you're concerned about your parents & Peter I would seriously consider stepping in to determine what help you can provide both your parents & Peter moving forward. It's never too late to seek medical & professional help for Peter. Getting him diagnosed is the first thing that should be done.", "NTA, but you really need to get Peter out if there. Does he have a high school diploma? Any university? Any job experience at all?\n\nIt\u2019s high past time you find a lawyer for Peter to help him get out of this. They have ruined his entire life.", "You have a bigger problem. Your brother is getting abused and you need to get him out. I'm being serious. He has lost all his bodily autonomy, all his agency. He isn't allowed to do anything in life others are. He isn't being coddled. He is actively being harmed.", "Er, NTA on not wanting to be a caretaker, but YTA for not helping Peter get out of this situation. Seriously, you're just leaving him stuck like this?\n\nIf he's as capable as you say he is, then he doesn't need a caretaker. That's moot. All he needs is someone to help him out of this hole his parents have dug.", "NTA even if Peter IS autistic, he's not your problem and you're well within your rights to say no.", "Why are so dispassionate about your parents abusing your brother for the majority of his life? People have been arrested and had their children taken away for this behavior. \n\nYou and Peter are both adults now, for f\u2019s sake help him get away from these completely insane ppl and cut them out of both of your lives.\n\nThat\u2019s why you are an AH. Health insurance is not worth being psychologically tortured. And yes, forced infantilization is torture.", "NTA, but I think a bit too much weight is getting put on the diagnosis/lack of a diagnosis in the post and the comments. Getting fully tested and diagnosed for autism is often a miserable and expensive process that can wreck someone's future. What people forget is that an official diagnosis severely limits your opportunities in a lot of areas of life. Not even mentioning the bias against diagnosing adults.\n\nThe issue, then, is that your parents are not treating your brother's situation with any nuance or respect whatsoever. There's a dominating view of autism that it just makes you completely functionless and incapable of staying alive by yourself, but this is almost never the case.\n\nEven if someone isn't diagnosed with something, you can still consider what **symptoms** they display, though. This is especially important with autism, since it's a pretty wide spectrum. Some people can mask in social situations really well, some people can't speak out loud, some don't like certain textures, some can't stand certain sounds, some hate both, some get angry when overstimulated, some shut down completely, some follow a rigid schedule that can actually help them in a job and daily life, some have trouble staying on a schedule at all, etc. \n\nGetting a grasp on these kinds of things are all way more important to help your brother than an actual diagnosis. Your parents are the assholes because they're not even attempting to do this; they just want to act like the disorder is fully synonymous with helplessness rather than actually learning about the complexities of your brother's life.\n\nEdit to add: And the key part here is that if your brother has these symptoms, it doesnt matter if he's diagnosed autistic. If your parents focused on visible symptoms, they could just help him in specific areas where he would need help regardless of his diagnosis, rather than smother him entirely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hell, Elon Musk claims he's on the spectrum!)\n\nBut yeah, your parents sound like awful people and intensely frustrating. So I suggest that instead of pushing back, you simply turn their own words against them whenever possible. If your brother is autistic then he needs therapy! You'd be super happy to \"take care of him\" when they're gone; actually, they should let you take over now and just give you money for his upkeep. (Then you use that money and access to give your brother a crash course in adulthood.) Send your parents links and pamphlets from charities that specialize in job placements for autistic adults.

I have no idea how normal that is for a non-autistic person.\n\nSomething many of my autistic friends struggle with, especially the early-diagnosis crowd, is self-advocacy. Unfortunately, most \"\"therapy\"' for autistic people reinforces the concepts of trying to hide your autism and obeying authority, no matter how uncomfortable or painful it is for you, and because of this, many do not know how to advocate for being treated fairly, how to set and achieve their own goals, and many of them don't even know what goals they want. The \"\"therapy\"\" they were put through did not teach them emotional regulation, how to take care of themselves, or how to take charge of their own lives.\n\nI don't think it matters whether your brother is really autistic or not. He was clearly subject to this same treatment. I think, as his family, you have an obligation to help him \u2013 and in this situation, you should help him out of this toxic environment.

If nothing is wrong then he probably just needs the courage and camouflage from you and maybe your other siblings to do so. \n\nI guess I just don't understand why your aren't doing more to help him.", "NTA your parents have crippled their son and refuse to face up to it", "NTA\n\nResponse to any relative: *I can be grateful for what my parents and family have given me and also be appalled at how they crippled my brother by insisting on him never being allowed to learn to care for himself, based on the passing comment of the spouse of someone in the medical profession. Parents had years of opportunity to (1) get Peter professionally diagnosed instead of clinging to a casual comment from a non-medical professional and (2) learn how to help Peter achieve his fullest potential instead of denying the possibility that he could learn anything and preventing anyone else from helping him learn anything. Your moral outrage at the handicapping of Peter has been missing for all these years. Where was your belief in speaking up for family then? You were complicit in hobbling Peter; you can now take steps to rectify what you allowed parents to do to him.*", "I believe this might fall under munchausen by proxy syndrome (  a mental health disorder in which a caregiver, most often a mother, routinely makes up fake symptoms or causes real symptoms in a child or adult victim to make it appear that the victim has a true physical or mental health issue) Your brother may have autism, but its called being on the spectrum for a reason my son is on the spectrum but he is really high functioning and most people dont even notice until well they do ( usually a social event or something that may cause him to be over stimulated, thats where his autism really shows), but he can care for himself and I DO NOT BABY HIM OR HOLD HIM BACK, I want him to take care of himself so instead of allowing him to be babied and taken care of I teach him how to function. you mom sounds like she needs help. FYI i got my son tested after my friend ( also a doctor) noticed some behavior of his, I got him tested.... got him recourses to support him not disable him.. catch my drift.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP you NTA but what your mom is doing to your brother is sick!", "NTA. Your parents' infantilization of your brother is abuse. Even if he were autistic, their goal should be in making sure that he is developing the skills needed to be able to live independently.", "Why dont the people calling you an ah care for him then? You didnt decide to become a parent either, they wanted himy never had an actual diagnosis, and never cared ro teach him anyt. They are still enabling himbto become a decent human beeing. And as far as i know, even autistic people are capable of loving by themselves. NTA", "Autism doesn\u2019t necessarily need a diagnosis \nA lot of people with autism are capable of doing many things for themselves. \nEven if Peter has severe autism and actually needs someone to take care of him, you aren\u2019t obligated to do it. \nNTA", "Nta", "NTA.  You\u2019re the only one advocating for Peter in this scenario.  He\u2019s an adult who hasn\u2019t been deem incompetent.  He has the power to get himself tested for any psych/behavioral condition.  Though at this point, even if a panel of qualified doctors say he\u2019s not actually autistic, they might still deny it.", "NTA  what they are doing is child abuse.", "Definite YTA. You're literally the older capable sister of your younger special needs brother. Its your moral responsibility to take care of him after your parents pass away, its weird that you have to ask strangers about this in the first place.", "NTA! your parents are cruel. please secretly do what you can to teach him things so he wont be scared when he no longer has them. i bet he wants to learn to be independant. youd be giving him and yourself a huge gift if you  get started on helping him learn life skills.", "NTA", "What you parents have done to Peter is abuse. I don't know about the systems in place where you are but I'd look into adult protective services and get them to intervene.\n\nThey've destroyed his life.\n\nNTA", "Wetter he is autistic or not, they are abusers kepping him small.

I am quite capable of living by myself. Did that for 30 years before discovering my now husband. Your parents are full of it. \n\nWhat is Peter saying about it? \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nAlthough TBH I would put an effort into teaching Peter stuff he\u2019ll need to know when you have a chance so that when the time comes he won\u2019t be totally lost.", "NTA That's nuts!", "NTA. They want to treat him like a baby and not let him grow up, so he is their responsibility.\n\nFeel free to go NC with them.", "Nta - I recommend you look up munchausen by proxy though", "Not only this but autistic doesn't equal helpless, it's a spectrum! Yes some are helpless, like my little brother but I on the other hand also have Autism and I have a full-time job, live alone, pay my bills and taxes, and went to college.", "They want him to be helpless, needy and dependent on them so they have a permanent \"baby\" in the house. They have created his \"autism\" out of nothing. NTA.", "Even if he really is on the spectrum, they are not doing him any good. I am on the spectrum and I have a job I go to everyday, I have a degree in gastronomy and I'm working on my teaching degree rn.

NTA at all.", "Family that calls you names should take Peter in", "Yeah, this is messed up. Itd already be bad enough if Peter was a teenager. But he\u2019s 27! He\u2019s an adult. How much of his life has he missed out on because of his parents? And even if he was autistic, there are all sorts lf autism and lots of people with autism are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves.", "I'm here too.\n\nI'm this situation, NTA\n\nIn life?  Why have they been allowed to do this to Peter?  Why has nobody stood up for Peter and protected him from this?  \n\nOP, why aren't you looking after your little brother?  He needs you.  He's being crippled, and you're not fighting for him.  How are you sleeping at night?", "Yeah like is there a psychological version of munchausen by proxy? They've made him entirely helpless by telling him that he is helpless his entire life, but without actually having to make him sick since there aren't physical symptoms of autism....", "My son has multiple disabilities. When my ex SIL found out my son is disabled she told everyone her son has a terminal disease. When my son was diagnosed as lactose intolerant her son developed a milk allergy. Everything my son has been diagnosed with her son has been diagnosed with, but worse. \n\nHer son is a healthy teenager than plays multiple sports. My son; is not.\n\nShe craves attention. It's absolutely ridiculous.", "Those honestly sounds like abuse.  Can you talk to anyone outside the family that can advise, I know he's an adult but social services may need to intervene. \n\nAlso even if he was autistic, how on earth would that atop him being able to do anything. \n\nYour brother needs help to escape this situation.", "Step 1: Go to their house \n\nStep 2: Help Peter pack a bag \n\nStep 3: Have him live with you at least temporarily", "Then why the f do you both care about what your parent think ? Can't you just cut contact and live your lives as adults ?", "honestly, you should say yes and take him now, because he is a hostage to their expectations and delusions. And he has been brow beaten by that to the point that he's probably a hostage, emotionally, to them. He's going to need help to free himself from them and the sooner the better. He's 27, and unless your parents have some sort of legal guardianship over him (which would probably require proof of a diagnoses) he's free to leave and you are free to rescue him. You are NTA for standing up to your parents, but Peter needs help now, not later.", "You and your siblings need to wait for one day when your parents aren't there and help him leave the house. I would also say that after he leaves, he should have limited or no contact with your parents after. What they're os beyond wrong. And the longer it continues, the worse it will get for your brother. He deserves a life of his own.", "I think you may have to pretend you're going to take care of him just so you can get him out of that house. Your parents are abusing him, and are not going to listen to reason. Poor guy.", "OK, so use the situation to manipulate your parents.  Tell them you\u2019ve reconsidered but want to start now.  You want Peter to move in with you now (so he can adjust because autistic people have a hard time adjusting - just a line for the parents I know everyone is different). \n\nThen help him be free.", "There is a little boy that lives next-door to me that has been diagnosed with autism. He is a wonderful kid that I enjoy talking to and I do see that his diagnosis is accurate. His mother though is constantly bringing it up and using it as an excuse for everything. He goes to regular school and is smart and friendly. Every time  I talk with her she works it into the conversation no matter what we are talking about. I get a munchausen by proxy vibe from her too. I think it is bad for him to hear her talking about him. I think she exaggerates to get sympathy.", "INFO: did Peter receive special education services/have an IEP? Did he graduate high school?", "That sounds exhausting.", "As an autistic fella who likes perfectly round eggs that fit on an english muffin just right, can you possibly link the egg pan if you know where he got it?", "People can love their children and still be bad parents.", "It's incredible how fast my parents pivoted to me being less capable and needing more support/intervention once I got an adult autism diagnosis (while I was living independently and in medical school). I'm exactly the same capable adult I've always been, and I have exactly the same needs I've had for decades. Latching on to a label can produce some weird behaviour in a lot of people. \n\nAnyway, autistic people who can't live independently are important and should be given support and respect by default. But that support should be personalised and actually helpful, and informed by the actual autistic person wherever possible. Denying independence wherever possible is not that.", "I\u2019m autistic and married with a kid and a job. My husband is autistic and works a very demanding job in addition to being an amazing father. We own our own home. Our daughter (autistic) is a sophomore in college with a 4.0 GPA. This idea that autistic people are helpless makes me crazy. Some people on the spectrum need more support, but some can lead fully independent lives. I feel so sorry for Peter. Whether he really is on the spectrum or not, his parents have crippled him.", "Yeah. It's ridiculous. I'm autistic and just moved out.  I'm living fully independent and it's going perfectly so far. The only things I'm struggling with (in this area) is just the huge adjustment which is a lot for me.", "YUP, autistic here, I have a full-time job, I live alone, pay for everything by myself, cook, clean drive...", "Oh sure! [this guy](https://a.co/d/a3hjfvY) is the one he has and he just does one egg in it. I also use it to make multiple breakfast sandwiches all at once for guests, super fun. They come out like perfectly English muffin sandwich sized. Frying in them is a lil tricky but definitely doable if you brush a fat/oil in there and on the edges too.\n\n[this one](https://a.co/d/1ST2AHh) is also great, but has less perfect roundness in the end eggy result, but is easier for frying", "Try searching one egg pan or mini egg pan. You can find them from 3.5\" to 6\" so measure your English muffins first. Be carefull as the handle is often too heavy for pan so they tip easy.", "I know", "Exactly this! I have ASD and my younger brother does as well, I'm the one that can function perfectly in life because I mask and I'm high functioning but my little brother is the hopeless kind of ASD. His first words were at 8-9, he was clean (meaning no more diapers or pull-ups) around the same time, had fixations on movies and games you couldn't touch or disrupt them or a massive meltdown tantrum would happen, I had to sit through Simba's father's death in the lion king on repeat soooooo many times because he liked that part so he would watch the part, stop it, rewind and play, over and over again, you had to wait until he decided to continue the movie. Today, he's in a group home with the help he needs because he could never take care of himself.", "Hello me!  Lol, we have very similar life experiences."]}
