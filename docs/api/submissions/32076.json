I am always much sicker than my husband with the same illness. My good friend is always the healthier one in her marriage. We were talking about how much we both hate our own side of it, AND the mismatched aspect. Being sicker is awful and guilt-producing. Being less sick is still bad and builds resentment. \n\nThere\u2019s no good option other than cursing your genetics and being grateful you don\u2019t feel quite as lousy as he does each time.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m the same way, but probably more extreme. I\u2019ll get a stomach bug and be slightly nauseous while my wife and kids would be throwing up for 2 days. Same with colds/flu. (Likely the benefits of growing up poor and unsanitary \ud83d\ude09).\n\nI can certainly understand the resentment building up - particularly with childcare - even as you acknowledge it\u2019s not your husband\u2019s fault. But it sounds like you\u2019re resenting your crappy situation more than actually resenting your husband.\n\nWhile you\u2019re sick, maybe try to limit any activities outside of childcare. Use DoorDash for meals/groceries, put most house chores on hold, etc. Maybe reward yourself with a spa treatment once the hubby can function again.", "You feel like TH when you get sick, you are still expected to clean house, take care of kids, shuttle to sports, etc. He just gets to be sick. I don\u2019t know if you have voiced this to him, but you\u2019re going to get resentful.", "NAH. Okay, every time you get sick, he gets sicker.  OP, if that\u2019s the way it is, then it is what it is. My advice to you is to lower your standards about what has to be done in maintaining the house and stockpile supplies (soup, evaporated milk, Biolyte, Clorox wipes, throat lozenges, disposable dishes and eating utensils, Vicks Vapor Rub, OTC meds, etc.) for when you are sick. Have a grocery and pharmacy that will deliver.  Don\u2019t do what doesn\u2019t have to be done. Trust me, that load of laundry doesn\u2019t have to be done till you feel better.", "Women are generally better at pushing through because we\u2019ve been doing it from a young age (menstruation). Mothers coddle their boys and they grow up to act like this when sick. My brother is a fucking nightmare when he is sick and it\u2019s because he was coddled while I was expected to just get on with things. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nI have a very strong immune system in general. Allergies knock me back at certain times of the year (I\u2019m allergic to life) but I\u2019m still fully functional when that happens. The covid vaccines were the only time I\u2019ve ever been honest to god sick in the last 3 years. \n\nMy husband on the other hand is almost always sick. It doesn\u2019t help that he\u2019s on a medication that makes him immunocompromised. And yeah, it sucks to get to see him just lay down and sleep all day while I still have to manage our household. I sometimes wish I could just have a day to sleep. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make you TA for having these feelings and you acknowledge that expressing them to your husband won\u2019t accomplish anything positive. If anything, I kind of think your friend is for making you feel bad about it when venting to them when you specifically are trying not to say anything to your husband because you know it\u2019s not his fault.", "NTA.\n\nI think that is a naturally feeling when you feel sick and don't have the help you need. I think you really need to get a babysitter or ask for help from friends or family during this period of time though, as the only real solution when you are both sick, is to turn outwards for help that can lighten the load.\n\nNot getting the rest you need is keeping you vulnerable to getting sick, and you should tell him that you feel like you need extra help, he can't currently do it because he is also sick, so you need to get people round to help out until you recover.", "Feelings are feelings, so NTA. I can see how that would be stressful.\n\nBut I wouldn't bring it up to anyone, or make him feel guilty because of it, because it really isn't something either of you can control.", "NTA, absolutely. It is natural that if your workload is bigger than you can manage you feel resentful albeit it is no one's fault.\n\nHowever, if I were you, I would look at that workload. I get you need caring for your daughter but if both of you are sick this would be a barebone caring. Just feed her/change her diapers/hug her. But you mentioned \"house\", and you do not absolutely need to care for that if you are sick. If you are a perfectionist please think that almost everything can wait.", "NTA, if you trust him and he really is feeling worse, that's just the way it goes unfortunately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am bias though, because with my ex. He always had to be sicker than me and there were even times I went to Urgent care, and he would have to come too because he felt worse. I would come out with med and the same Dr wouldn't prescribe him anything because he didn't even have strep/flu/the gross icky  that I did. One day I was throwing up everywhere and he felt \"worse\" but had the energy to eat everything in the house and play video games, but was mad when I wouldn't change the babies diapers and he had to so he purposely gagging while he did it and made all kinds of noise so I couldn't sleep.", "You haven't acted on it so NTA. You know he's not lying (only you can be the judge because you know him, he's your husband) so it's really not his fault. But you're also tired and sick and feel alone in the tasks so ofc you're also sad and angry. You guys should start working on a plan to boost your immune system or ask someone to come help with a mask and pay them, no idea.", "NAH for your feelings. You\u2019d become the AH if you treated him any differently because of it.\n\nYou need to talk to him about this, though. When you\u2019re both sick, and he\u2019s worse, there\u2019s not much you can do. But if circumstances allow, when he improves, he needs to allow you time to rest to fully recover before the next time. Even if you feel better, take the extra day to let your body heal from pushing through.", "You can feel how you feel but it doesn't help anything.", "NTA its the man cold problem, and i say this as a man", "NTA. This seems to be a common thing in relationships and whether he\u2019s exaggerating or not it\u2019s still not fair for all of the housework to fall onto you by default.", "If you really believe that he is as sick as he says and not exaggerating, then NAH. \n\nI totally get why you\u2019re exhausted and frustrated and feeling a little resentful. It sounds like you have handled it maturely, by not lashing out at your husband, and instead venting a little to someone you thought was a trusted friend. \n\nHe\u2019s not an AH either, again, provided he\u2019s really that sick. That being said, hopefully he\u2019s mindful enough to realize that he\u2019s leaving you to take care of everything when you feel like crap too, and is doing everything he physically can to help out.", "NAH for feeling resentful -- your husband isn't being sicker on purpose, but you -- both as a couple and a person -- are under-resourced, and it's really not \"fair\" that you can't just recover while sick, you have to take care of stuff.\n\nBut maybe frame it more as resentment at the situation than specifically at your husband, because it's not really anything he can control.", "NTA all bets are off when you have a baby. Try not to let resentment fester.", "NAH. He can't help being sick any more than you can but I can understand you being frustrated that when you feel bad and could do with a bit of pampering, you can't get it because he's always worse off.", "Just coming here to say that it gets better. Until JK.. then it all starts again. And NAH.. you need support and society is not set up to support mothers.. full stop. You need a village but the village doesn't exist \nTransfer your resentment to capitalism", "NTA. \n\nI think he's exaggerating. He can't always be sicker than you. Does he still manage to sit up and play video games?", "Men generally have weaker immune systems for those sorts of conditions, which is why the \"man-flu\" is a thing which has since been proven. \n\nI imagine over our history, we genetically selected for women who were still able to care for their children while sick or the children were more likely to die. Apparently, it didn't matter if the man became too sick to take care of the kids.\n\nBut yeah, it sucks that you're always left to do the heavy lifting even though you don't feel great either. \n\nNAH", "I'm gonna go with NTA because they're just your feelings. You're allowed to have feelings. \n\nIt's been shown that men's tolerance for pain is lower than women's, so I've always wondered if that plays out in how men and women get sick. Given that people who ovulate, practically speaking, \"get sick\" every month I also have heard stories essentially just that women are able to keep working when sick where men cannot. \n\nIt's a testemant to your strength that you're still able to function, but also I do think how we socialize men in our society to, in general, be \"taken care of\" rather than a \"caretaker\" has some degree of an effect. Moms around the world feel your pain, I've no doubt.", "NTA. Trust me majority of the men act like they are dying when sick. I'd start pulling an uno reverse on him.", "\ud83e\udd14Make something up and see if he suddenly has it too", "Info: With his symptoms always being worse is it after you mentioned it about yourself?\n\nBecause if he only saying it after you mentioned a symptom then he an AH and making it up. \nYes i know people like that you have something and they always have the same thing only worse. \n\nBut if he genuinely complains first that he worse then he got a shitty immune system. \nMy husband rarely gets sick but when he does it\u2019s a lot worse than me. \nBut I get sick every time our kids are sick he doesn\u2019t mine only last a few days when his will last a week.", "NTA I feel he is probably exaggerating a little because he knows you will 'push through ' and take care of the house even if your ill too. But I would have a gentle conversation and just say that you also need some recovery at times when your both ill .", "If you can push through it, so can he. Unless his dying of course. \n\nAnd this is coming from someone that takes a month to recover from a simple cold. If I\u2019m over here barely breathing because of a cold yet I still can do my job,cook,clean,take care of errands and nap the cold away, so can he. Like I throw up phlegm,have to do breathing therapy,take 300 medication,get sore throat and chest pains because of how hard I have to cough. \n\nWe as women are always told to keep going no matter the pain, we \u201chave \u201c to be the caregiver and ignore how we feel while men are allowed to be in pain and sick and do nothing. Life doesn\u2019t stop when women are sick so it shouldn\u2019t stop when men are, especially if he has  energy to play video games. \n\nI can understand if he\u2019s literally falling asleep and can\u2019t even hold himself straight because that mean his body doesn\u2019t have the energy to support itself while trying to fight the illness but , every time? That\u2019s not statistically possible unless he has some sort of underlying condition that should be taken care off. I\u2019ve seen my fianc\u00e9 get sick and he\u2019s functional 85% of the time, the worst I\u2019ve seen him is when he got covid and that\u2019s understandable. \n\nYou also deserve to rest and heal properly and if he\u2019s only sick when you\u2019re sick for the same length you\u2019re also sick, I\u2019d be suspicious about that. Cause the chances that you\u2019re both sick at the same time , every time and for the same length of time are not that high.", "It\u2019s called a \u201cman cold.\u201d Idk why they tend to do worse, but they do. Maybe because as another poster said, women are used to feeling crappy at least monthly. Maybe men go around just feeling great all the time, so when they do get sick they can\u2019t function?", "Yes, you are.  Men\u2019s immune systems are not as strong as women\u2019s.

Me and my Mrs  went to visit to see the baby. he had a snotty cold.\n\nJesus H Christ, 2 days later I was floored, as was my wife. Same thing though, I was completely wiped out, could barely move.

It is biology.", "NTA. Sounds sexist I know but men tend to be much bigger babies when it comes to illnesses than women do. If a woman gets sick she'll pump herself full of cold medicine and still tend to the kids and housework.  If a man gets sick with the same illness he'll be bedridden for days. It's because women are always expected to be the caregivers even if they are sick themselves.", "Mens immune defence is weaker than womens. On the negative side we get sicker from infections more often and get hit worse, on the plus side we get fewer autoimmune diseases.\n\nGetting pissed over that fact is no different than getting pissed over the fact that men more often are colorblind.", "He's not actually sicker than you. All men revert to being a 6 month old baby when they're sick. Tell him to suck it up and walk it off. You both have a child that needs you both even when you're sick.

He readily takes more sick days than I do too-- I have to be pretty much on death's door to do that.

A woman claims the same and you're happy to believe it.\n\n>which is not how sickness actually works, people present with different degrees of symptoms even if they get sick with the same pathogen\n\nEven here, you're doubling down. So again, you're calling that woman a liar. And that's why I'm harping on about gender. You can't sit here and claim to believe a woman when the exact same logic you're using to villify a man applies to her too. Yet here you are doing just that.", "Yeah. My wife is medically retired and registered disabled, and our physical capabilities are night and day, but I wouldn't dream of saying something like \"you failed me\" to her.", "That\u2019s silly and hospitals would certainly get annoyed real quick. When you have a fever, you shouldn\u2019t exert yourself and stay put. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to be at the hospital lmao", "It\u2019s entirely possible to be bed-bound and yet not admitted to hospital. For an example from a couple of days ago, check out the pre-inquest coroner\u2019s hearing on Maeve Boothby O\u2019Neill.", "Who can actually afford to go to the hospital every time they are too sick to get up.  I get migraines, if I held to this I would be at the hospital at least once or twice a week.", "I can literally see your post.", "Show me this \"vilification\"", "Show me this \"vilification\". \n\nI think you're getting a little hysterical.", "Yeah, I know, I corrected my comment", "You're calling a man a liar for something you will believe a woman for. You're literally making him the villain in this scenario. You're attaching negative personality traits and toxic behaviour on his behalf and then claiming its different when a woman tells you it happens to her. \n\nI just want you to show some consistency honestly. But apparent that's beyond you", ">I never posted on there. I commented sometimes. And that was years ago. Did you never comment on subs that you didn't 100% agree with?\n\n>ETA, oh yeah, I forgot I posted a YouTube video of a man who sings about how cheaters manipulate their GFS.\n\nWell then to answer your question, no. No I have never made a post in a group that I didn't agree with to share something I feel would help them."]}
