Usually Aaron is understanding of this but it seems not this time.\n\nHis team had gone to the finals and were playing a game and he wanted me to come but the doctor had called us earlier on in the day talking about potential treatments and I just couldn't go to his match.\n\nHe came home mad and upset about how I had missed a game, I'd be fine with him expressing his anger but the level he was yelling at was simply too much and Jennifer is very sensitive to loud noises. When I tried to explain this he said that I was being a total dickhead and neglecting him.\n\nAaron has been staying with his aunt since that argument and has not been contacting me, only Jennifer\n\nEDIT: No their aunt is unable to take Jennifer to her appointments, this is because Jennifer feels uncomfortable about being with anyone that is not me (or my wife). I am trying my best to give both children equal attention but due to her fear of death Jennifer has been extremely clingy and I just don't have it in me to tell her I need to spend more time with her brother and leave her.\n\nPlease understand I am not purposely neglecting my son, it is the last thing I'd do.", "created_utc": 1679941074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123vfvt/aita_my_son_says_im_favouring_his_sister_due_to/", "score": 502, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He just lost his mother, he's losing his twin (a relationship most of us can never comprehend) and probably feels like he's losing you too and that is too much for him to handle.\n\nTo protect your relationship with your son, you need to make sure to be there for his important events now and set time aside that's just for you and him.

While ostensibly you have many years ahead with him in your life, you aren\u2019t going to get this specific time back. You need to find ways of making him feel noticed and cared for. Even if you can\u2019t distribute your time evenly. \n\nI can\u2019t blame him for having a big emotional response. He\u2019s going through so much.

I am so sorry you're having to go through this first with your wife then with your daughter. \n\nI understand where your son is coming from, because he's having to live a life both where he lost his mom, he's likely to lose his sister, and he's having to sacrifice a lot of being a normal kid with his dad because of it. \n\nThis is the kind of situation where you need to have a very serious conversation with your son and let him know that you're still his parent, you still love him, and you'll try the absolute best you can to be there for him for all the things in his life. Unfortunately, at the same time, you have to try your best to get as much time with your daughter, and for him- his sister as possible, given how insanely finite it seems to be. \n\nFor doctor's appointments to discuss treatments, yes, those are extremely important. I don't know if those are things that you can try to squeeze into the same day or a different day so you can occasionally go to your son's events. But if there's ANY wiggle room, both your kids deserve your best efforts to be there for them throughout all of this. \n\nIf his thing HAS to take a backseat to her treatment, discuss it with him before hand and try to make it up to him.", "YTA.

He is a young man who is struggling with the loss of his mother, the imminent loss of his sister, and now a father who doesn\u2019t make time to support him.\n\nHe is at an incredibly emotionally vulnerable age and needs a father-figure to help guide him.

His mother just passed away, his twin sister has cancer and his father is so wrapped up in that, that he can't make time for him.

Right before that happened you were dealt another crushing blow in finding out that you are also going to lose your daughter, your son is going to lose his sister, and your daughter is dealing with the crushing blow that she will likely never see her eighteenth birthday.\n\nThere is no right way to deal with this. Your feeling like you need to prioritize the time you've got left with your daughter, is completely natural. It's also natural that your son is going to be feeling overlooked. Especially while he's struggling with the loss of his mom, and the impending loss of his sister. \n\nBoth of your kids need you to show up for them right now, and in different ways. Your son needs to know that you're to be there for him, and not just after your daughter is gone. They both need you right now, and while I understand how important these doctors appointments are, you also need to push for different appointment times if they conflict with things that are really important to your son sometimes. \n\nIf you try to defer that responsibility to your son, until after your daughter has passed, you will be left with a relationship with your son that may be unsalvageable.

This will shape the kind of adult and potential father that Aaron turns into. \n\nI don\u2019t doubt for a moment that he is fully aware of his sister\u2019s condition and limited time. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not still painful for him to be losing time with his father (and only remaining parent) because of it. I\u2019m not saying you need to neglect Jennifer for Aaron, but it\u2019s important that you set aside time just for Aaron.

I mean, she\u2019s be fairly close if your son is in school but staying with her at the moment. You can use that proximity to your advantage here to help your son.\n\nHave the aunt come and either stay entirely with your family (if that\u2019s possible) or see if she would be willing to stay for long periods of time (given space) if not. She sounds like someone who is supportive (giving you advice and helping your son) so her additional presence would help off-set you being a solo parent dealing with all of this by yourself. You need the help, especially now. \n\nHer direct presence would also allow you more one-on-one time with your son and while your daughter is understandably attached to you and afraid, it would give her another person who can be there with/for her when you are with your son (barring appointments, etc).\n\nWhat you should be doing right now, in addition to immediate therapy for your entire family unit, is taking steps to address the \u201cwhat comes after\u201d. Please forgive my bluntness here but, once the dust settles and all is said and done, it will be you and your son dealing with the aftermath of horrible circumstances. Not only this, but your son is likely to be 18 and ready for college meaning he will also be very tempted to run to \u201cget away\u201d and that could have serious consequences for any future relationship you have with him. \n\nIm not at all saying you should neglect your daughter in any way; quite the contrary.

I understand you wanting to spend every moment with her, and doing every appointment, but you are emotionally neglecting your son and as long you recognize this and talk to him, maybe you can work something out so you don\u2019t lose him either. \n\nYou have to take in consideration on how he\u2019s feeling too.

You\u2019ve mentioned living relatives that help you since your wife died, if it\u2019s possible, see if they\u2019re able to go to maybe one or two of your daughters appointments so you can spend some time with your son. Just dedicate a day to him every once in a while, and have one of those relatives or a close trusted friend on hand to be with your daughter. Just may giving him some time here and there will show him you do care, and should help fix the crumbling relationship. If you dedicate all your time to your daughter, which everyone can under with these circumstances, it might cause your son into isolation, and any relationship you have together will be lost when she finally passes as well. You don\u2019t want to lose your entire family, at this rate you will if something doesn\u2019t change.

I want it tome spent with the people I love, and that means doing things they or we all like. \n\nI think you need to sit them both down and admit you're out of your depth here (quite understandably, you're grieving too) and ask them for their help and suggestions. It's okay to admit you don't have all the answers, and to ask your children if not for help, then for their suggestions. Maybe your daughter would have wanted to go to the game. \n\nMy feeling, even when to comes to things like missing treatments, os that it's about quality of life, not just quantity. Yes, I missed some debilitating chemo so I could attend  my niece's wedding. Maybe it shortened the time I have left, maybe not, but I don't regret that, and I never will. \n\nYou all need to be making memories together, and your daughter getting to be with those she loves. Ask them both for some activities they want to do (my family calls this my \"buckets of fun\" list rather than my bucket list) and then plan once or twice a month to do a couple of activities from the list.

Do you expect to miss many important to him events, then your daughter dies, and then somehow magickly your son will welcome you back?\n\nI get it.  You can't be two places at once.  On times where you absolutely CAN'T be there for your son, it is your job to ensure that another adult he loves and trust is there.   It is important for you to accept your son's point of view.

Usually Aaron is understanding of this but it seems not this time.\n\nHis team had gone to the finals and were playing a game and he wanted me to come but the doctor had called us earlier on in the day talking about potential treatments and I just couldn't go to his match.\n\nHe came home mad and upset about how I had missed a game, I'd be fine with him expressing his anger but the level he was yelling at was simply too much and Jennifer is very sensitive to loud noises.

I would also say that it might be really difficult, but if your son needs to express himself loudly on occasion it might be best to let him do that and really listen and respond to what he's saying.

Life is being unfair and there are not enough hours in the day. \n\nIt does sound like there are times when you \\*could\\* give your son attention over Jennifer - not medical appointments of course, but you mention that she's been clingy and that you are doing activities she chooses. While that's understandable, she cannot have everything you have to give when you have two children. Even terminally ill children sometimes have to hear the word 'no'. Taking turns to choose activities will likely help repair the relationship.", "NAH but you do need to make sure your son still has a parent. You are both dealing with so much grief and have more to come, and you\u2019ll need each other as the only ones who can understand. I truly doubt you\u2019re purposefully neglecting his needs but he is a kid still and you\u2019re all he has to lean on.

I can\u2019t imagine how much weight is on your shoulders right now. I get where Aaron is coming from but also what Jennifer is going through is scary af. You want to be there for your kids but also still grieving for the loss of your partner that you don\u2019t have time for especially pending Jennifer\u2019s diagnosis. I\u2019m unqualified to give you advice but if I may suggest to let Aaron calm down and in the meantime maybe write him a letter of how you feel and how much you want to be there for him but also how vulnerable you are and how scared you are of losing your family that you might have neglected him too much. But you wouldn\u2019t do it on purpose and he is just as important to you as Jennifer and his mother. Make an effort to find one day or maybe a few hours where you can have time with him, take him for a movie or something you can bond with him. Tell Jennifer you need some time with her brother who needs his remaining parent as well. And as some other Redditors have suggested, maybe start therapy together or something along the lines. But make a conscious effort to include him in something where he feels your love. And maybe talk to Jennifer about how she can give you and Aaron some time to bond or if she wants some time with friends while you guys do something. And maybe think about giving yourself a little room to breathe, because you sound like you need time too.", "Fellow brain tumour mom here \u2026I agree completely with this comment.  Both your children need you and I\u2019m sure you are barely functioning yourself.  When our daughter was diagnosed with Glioblastoma we had to ask for help.  It really does take a village.    Please ask family and friends for help.    \n\nAlso, my daughter was given 3-5 years tops and she is tumour free (knock on wood) 5.5 years later.

Make a wish or similar organizations are great for this. \n\nI am so so sorry for all that you are going through.", "Aaron is going through this totally alone.

But OP look up \u201cglass child\u201d. These are kids whose parents see right through them because a sibling takes up a disproportional amount of parental energy and focus, usually due to illness or disability. And the need to focus on and assist a sick child is obvious - this isn\u2019t a scenario where your daughter is a golden child, the focus and energy given to a sick child isn\u2019t more positive attention it\u2019s just necessary. \n\nBut you will lose your son if you let him be a glass child. He needs you too. He needs to feel loved after loss and anticipating more loss.", "Well said.", "And if the lesson the son learns from this is \u201cdad\u2019s not there for me when I need him,\u201d they actually might not have all those years ahead of them.", "To make the situation even worse, if OP can\u2019t find time to devote to his son it\u2019s quite possible his son will go NC when he turns 18. If the son has to deal with two more years of this (more or less depending on when the daughter passes) there will be sooo much resentment built up that he will go off to college and never speak to his father again. \nI completely understand the pressure OP is under but he\u2019s got to find a way to manage it.

My child had brain cancer and scanxiety is real.", "Right now going through my own treatment with another type and in my experience whenever the doctors call me, they request I come immediately, whether its for a new treatment or just a transfusion or a test.\n\nSometimes doctors also need blood tests or other tests to determine whether they can start or continue a phase of treatment, and they usually want to get those as soon as possible too.\n\nI think it\u2019s the same or a simillar case for OP\u2019s daughter.", "Yep or in 2 years he will find he has lost 2 children.", "No, he's seriously taking care of his kid. Don't pass judgment on this guy if you've never been there.", "Really? This man has also lost his wife and is now losing his child. There are no AH here. Aaron is grieving too but OP cannot pour from an empty cup either. Aaron probably needs therapy to understand that his dad loves him but that at this moment he is drained too.  I don\u2019t know how many people here thoughtless brandishing this man as an AH , have been a carer for a dying child. \n\nThis entire situation sucks but OP is doing the best he can, and yes sometimes his best will fall short and that doesn\u2019t make him an AH. Aaron will not understand this now as a 15 year old, but hopefully as he grows up, he\u2019ll understand what his father went through.  Most of us (outside of Redditors seemingly) do eventually forgive our parents for not being perfect, it is a part of life, that comes with maturity.", "Honestly, I would say save the therapy for after his daughter passes. She doesn\u2019t need to spend her last couple years seeing a therapist every week. I say this as someone who just lost her dad to cancer so I may be biased. Take it with a pinch of salt.", "Tumour free?! That's amazing!!! Here's wishing the very best for you and your family.", "Depending where OP is that might not be in their control.

I'm sorry, but it seems like you don't want to change the status quo, but just want to find a reason that there's nothing you can do and that the son should suck it up. \n\nYou said you can go to the game but you'll be late so you didn't bother, that for me makes you an AH. It's better to be late than not to go. You're doing it wrong OP. Don't be surprised when you'll lose your son.", "Both of your kids need therapy. Your son just lost his mother. The statistics are insanely high for self offing if a twin dies. You\u2019re expecting him to be happy on the back burner.

I can\u2019t begin to imagine what you and your children are going through at the moment. \n\nIt sounds like your son has been pretty understanding of the limited time he has with you. He is however still a child that has just lost his mum and is watching his twin go through a devastating illness.

That's a few years where Aaron is effectively an orphan because his father isn't there for him at all in the ways that matter. Being a father is more than keeping food in the fridge and a roof over his head.", "That doesn't make it less true. \n\nLook, OP, I don't doubt that Aaron understands why this is happening. But even with the best of intentions and his maximum good will, that will not make it less of a slap in the face after Jennifer is gone and you only then start to pay attention to him. \n\nYou probably don't need to make him top priority, but you do need to actively make him ***a*** priority. Even if it's something that you need to schedule in advance, as in, deciding that only the direst of circumstances will make you miss his games on x, y, and z dates, telling Jennifer ahead of time that that's what's happening, and then following through even when you feel crappy or, as it seems to have been this time, you need to arrive late and with her because of a last minute appointment.", "15-18 is a pretty crucial time to pay attention to your kid, even before you layer on the grief of losing his mom and twin.", "That comment is what solidified it for me, too. It's one thing to say \"critical care and medical appointments are more important than basketball games\". It is something entirely different to say \"don't express your valid feelings, you might upset your sister\". \n\nIt seems like sister's wants and needs are coming first 100% of the time, in every single situation. And my heart breaks for OP because that would be any parent's natural instinct. But your other kid needs you and that's not fair.", "Take it from me, the kid who was left behind with grieving parents after the death of my sister, there absolutely ***is*** an A H here. The son owes his dad nothing. He matters too. If the dad wants a relationship with him in the future, he\u2019d better shape up now. It took my parents\u2019 and my relationship decades to recover after theY neglected Me, and frankly they are lucky I ever forgave them after hey let me down. Dont talk about what you haven\u2019t lived.", "Well, actually, if you read the comments he was able to do both, he just would have been late to the basketball game. Which is better than not coming at all and likely would have avoided this whole situation.", "Yes. I kinda think dying is more important than a sports event. Or even a couple of years less than ideal parental attention. Dad should be tackling the son's jealousy as the problem, not his behaviour. Is it too much to ask a 15 year old to accept that circumstances are not ideal but they have a duty to put their sister's death ahead of a bit of dad's attention? I don't think so. And if this jealousy is not stopped, Aaron will have serious guilt issues over being jealous of a dying sister in her last years when he's older. It's not ideal but sometimes children have to shoulder adult burdens for the good of the family. And at 15 he is capable of living as an adult if he has to.", "End of life therapy is a thing and can be very beneficial. Dying isn't always a peaceful process, especially for a teenager, and stress and anxiety can make it even more miserable.", "Therapy both now and after would be the best approach.", "I was kind of thinking the same, it sounds like it's going to bring up a lot of heart ache at some point. If she doesn't have long, it seems unnecessary. I guess it could be beneficial potentially. \n\nI do think the parents (or at least one of them) might benefit from going with the son though. To discuss things and figure out a way to make him feel less shitty about all of this.", ">She doesn\u2019t need to spend her last couple years seeing a therapist every week. \n\nShe does need to come to terms with dying. That is a BIG ask for a teenager. Connecting her to a supportive therapist who is well versed with coming to terms with death is probably the best gift a father could give her right now.", "I have a pretty jaundiced view of therapy, including that it would create MORE scheduled activities.  I\u2019d like to suggest that you talk with Aaron and think about some activities that he would love that could be done on the spur of the moment when you all have free time.  Especially this could help compensate for his disappointment when there is conflict.", "Thank you!  Next scan is in May.  Hoping for continued good news.", "YTA. There can be compromises made here. The dad could assign a trusted family member to be going to some of the doctors appointments so he can attend his some of his sons major life events. \n\nAlso healthcare is very flexible. If they were just discussing treatment he could\u2019ve asked the doctor for a telehealth visit instead and gone to his sons game after versus driving to the hospital. It could\u2019ve been postponed until the next day. There are a lot of flexible options to give OP more time with his son. He should discuss them with the provider and look into family counseling.", "It's in a comment they had to physically go in to see the doc", "You're right about this, and I picked up on it, too.  He was overwhelmed with treatment options for his daughter, so later he did not go to his son's game.\n\nIt is all so hard for every member of the family, but dad needs to compartmentalize a little.  He can feel overwhelmed about a decision (daughter's treatment), table that in his mind, then go to the game.  He doesn't have to follow the game, but just be there physically to put his arm around his son and tell him, \"Good game!  I'm proud of you.\"  Sometimes being there physically, even if dad couldn't really be there mentally, would still have been positive attention for his son.", "Bull. A comment below says they actually had to see the doctor and get scans done. That could take a few hours.", "You are so right about the order of priority the dad has.  The  son's in last place and wants his father to remember that he is also just fifteen, grieving his mom and scared about the death of his TWIN being in the not distant future.", "But you are aware of the favoritism and not correcting it.

Shes asleep. She\u2019s not gonna realize you guys are gone for five minutes", "> Please understand any favouritism is not intentional.\n\nI doubt that feels any better to Aaron. Remember that when he turns his back on you as soon as he gets the opportunity.", "She's clingy. That's reasonable. But that isn't a reason to tell your other child that they have to negate their emotions.\n\nShe's 17 and going thru a horrible thing- but you need to be the parent and tell her that you and her brother need a couple of minutes. Let your son be angry. Let him yell.\n\nHe's lost his mom. He's losing his twin. And his dad is focused on everything and everyone but him 99% of the time. He gets to be angry and get loud about that sometimes.\n\nI imagine this isn't the first time he's expressed these feelings- just the first time, he did loudly enough that it bothered you enough to listen.", "I'm sorry, your teenage daughter is refusing to sleep alone and your response is to indulge her instead of getting her some mental health support and setting healthy boundaries? I understand that she's terminally ill but c'mon, man. Are you gonna live with a 15-year-old barnacle for the time she has left, constantly ignoring and de-prioritizing your healthy child as you go?", "It is favouritism though, intentional or not. Once your daughter dies, you won\u2019t have a son either. Neglect like this is not repairable, regardless of your daughters circumstances. Do you not understand that your son is also suffering? \n\nYTA, gently, but you\u2019re still treating your son like trash.", "Aslong as you understand it when you\u2019re not invited to anything any further bc it\u2019s easier to pretend you don\u2019t have a dad then to constantly be let down by him", "came here to say this", "Having someone to talk to when you have a terminal illness is pretty important. It gives you a sounding board for the things you can't say to loved ones, including \"I'm done, I don't want more treatment, how do I tell them\".", "Duh, thank you.", "Yes for a few hours in the morning. He could have definitely been in the stands for his sons game.", "Few...it was a night game.", "Not sure where you got that information.

This is a perfect situation for the son to develop depression and that could lead to something worse", "Did you miss the part where the kid was diagnosed with brain cancer and lost her mother within the span of a few months?  My dad died when I was 12 and I slept with my mother and started sucking my thumb again for at least a year or two.", "No, actually, he doesn't. He's a parent, not a fairy godmother, and he has two children, both of whom deserve equal consideration. It's not the job of any parent, under any circumstance, to give a child everything they want. \n\nEspecially since it's not like he's going through a bucket list with her, he's sitting in a room while she sleeps because she refuses to sleep alone. That's not healthy. And to your point, the damage he does to Aaron and that relationship now will last a hell of a lot longer than any disappointment Jennifer feels, as callous as that sounds. If he was setting basic healthy boundaries with Jennifer it wouldn't even be hard to keep Aaron feeling seen, but he refuses to do *anything* that even remotely deprioritizes Jennifer.", "He mentioned in a comment that doc was 1pm, game was 4.30pm and they couldn't get there in time.\n\nTbh though, it's not about the game. If it was just one game, even an important one, it probably would be forgiven if it wasn't such a constant pattern.", "And when she is gone his son will have lost a mother, a twin, and a father. And she might not die, which is why they are going to appointments and whatnot. How long does he deserve to be neglected for? If she lives another 10 years? 15? Doctor predicted death dates are incorrect all the time. She deserves to be Prioritized, but prioritizing one of them does not mean ignoring the emotional needs of the other.", "I agree with you. It feels like some commenters are acting like there is a choice here. There is no choice. She is dying.", "Assuming he doesn\u2019t get cancer aswell, or worse from feeling like no one cares about how he feels", "That might be right, but OP is not being honest with themselves. \n\nThey say the favouritism isn't intentional. I'm sure the son understands but when your only parent effectivley says I'm trying not to play favourites but obviosuly are what's the son supposed to do?", "But he has another child who's being neglected and negatively impacted as a result. A child who lost his mom, is losing his *twin*, and now has effectively lost his dad as well. He is doing both kids a disservice by not getting them professional help, and the unfortunate reality is that the negative impact is going to affect Aaron for an exponentially longer period of time.", "But sports games aren\u2019t short.

This kid has basically lost all of his immediate family and is basically left to himself to figure out all of this grief he is dealing with, this kind of grief can break men in their 50s let alone a teenager whose emotions and hormones are all over the place", "Exactly.  For dad to have been physically (if not mentally) in the stands for a little while would have meant a lot to his son.", "Yes and the statistics for s**cide after a twin dies is insanely high. Should we really be acting like he should just suck it up?", "Getting a meeting with a specialist is not something you can simply reschedule for the next day. It can often take months. My aunt is disabled and the waiting lists for some of her specialists are ridiculous. Even for things that are considered life-threatening situations that need immediate consultation.
