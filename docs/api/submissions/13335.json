Usually Aaron is understanding of this but it seems not this time.\n\nHis team had gone to the finals and were playing a game and he wanted me to come but the doctor had called us earlier on in the day talking about potential treatments and I just couldn't go to his match.\n\nHe came home mad and upset about how I had missed a game, I'd be fine with him expressing his anger but the level he was yelling at was simply too much and Jennifer is very sensitive to loud noises. When I tried to explain this he said that I was being a total dickhead and neglecting him.\n\nAaron has been staying with his aunt since that argument and has not been contacting me, only Jennifer\n\nEDIT: No their aunt is unable to take Jennifer to her appointments, this is because Jennifer feels uncomfortable about being with anyone that is not me (or my wife). I am trying my best to give both children equal attention but due to her fear of death Jennifer has been extremely clingy and I just don't have it in me to tell her I need to spend more time with her brother and leave her.\n\nPlease understand I am not purposely neglecting my son, it is the last thing I'd do.", "created_utc": 1679941074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123vfvt/aita_my_son_says_im_favouring_his_sister_due_to/", "score": 1911, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He just lost his mother, he's losing his twin (a relationship most of us can never comprehend) and probably feels like he's losing you too and that is too much for him to handle.\n\nTo protect your relationship with your son, you need to make sure to be there for his important events now and set time aside that's just for you and him. You can still be there for the majority of your daughter's time but you cannot neglect your son or you might lose him too.\n\nI'm so sorry, I can't imagine your pain.  NAH.\n\nETA this excellent suggestion by:\n>ChaosofaMadHatter: \n\n>OP, something I would suggest is pick one day a week that is just for your son, where you\u2019re unlikely to have appointments- say Sunday. And Sunday\u2019s are just about him. Where he wants to go to dinner, what activity he wants to do (bowling, movies, etc), and most importantly HOW he wants to do it, whether it\u2019s with or without his sister. Be there for your daughter as much as you can the other six days of the week, but carve out at least one day or just an afternoon each week that is solely his.", "You\u2019re in a really tough position right now. So I don\u2019t even feel comfortable assigning anyone TA. NAH\n\nI think you need to listen to your son when he\u2019s saying he needs support too. Of course your attentions are going to be uneven at times bc of the circumstances, but your son is grieving his mother and going to lose his twin sister too. He needs you. While ostensibly you have many years ahead with him in your life, you aren\u2019t going to get this specific time back. You need to find ways of making him feel noticed and cared for. Even if you can\u2019t distribute your time evenly. \n\nI can\u2019t blame him for having a big emotional response. He\u2019s going through so much. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to manage my emotions if I had all that going on, and I\u2019ve had a lot more years of practice than he has.", "INFO: I'm trying to understand how the doctor's call earlier in the day kept you from going to your son's match. Did the doctor ask you to bring your daughter immediately for the new treatment?  Also, do you have anyone to help you with your daughter? Someone who can take her to a treatment so you don't miss something important to your son?\n\nThis is certainly a very difficult situation,  but it does sound like you're missing out on a lot going on with your son, and by the time your daughter is gone, he might be emotionally gone, too. You need to try to get help so you can be there for your son.

Your hands are pretty much tied behind your back. \n\nI feel like if she is going to be your main priority for now, you are def going to have to make room atleast once a week for your son or you will lose him. You can\u2019t choose one child over the other, or forget that children need nurturing. It really sucks, but I think if I were in the same situation and saw it was making my son hurt to the extent that he is, then I\u2019d try family counseling or even try to make more time for him cause I wouldn\u2019t want to lose him too.", "You can\u2019t ignore your son\u2019s emotional needs for the rest of your daughter\u2019s life and expect to have a relationship with him after she passes.\n\nYta", "For the way you're treating Aaron right now, I'm sorry, but you're being an AH towards your son\n\nBut you can still fix it  \nThe real AH here is the situation, which just sucks for everyone involved, but that doesn't mean you should value only your daughter's feelings  \nEven when your son is communicating in the only way he knows how right now, you're thinking only of your daughter\n\nYou need to talk to your son, you can't keep doing everything your daughter wants to do if it means you're constantly overlooking your son, if you push him away too much, the damage may be irreversible and I'm sure neither of you wants that to happen  \nLook, this appointment was about medical treatments, so you're not an AH for missing this particular one, but your son shouldn't need to continue to be understanding for you choosing not to support him\n\nYou're struggling with your wife's death and your daughter's illness, you're struggling to find a healthy balance that makes it clear to both your children that they both matter\n\nYou need to have an open conversation with your son  \nIf you can't say it out loud, write it in a letter, but give it to him and have him read it while you're there, so you can talk after  \nDon't let him lock you out, if you accept it, you're risking him thinking that you don't want him  \nPlease don't let this get to that point, he needs you too, and you need him, his sister needs him, he needs her  \nThe three of you need to find a way to form a team", "NAH\n\nWow, what a terrible situation for everyone, so sorry.", "OP, first, and foremost\u2026.

Your are in a horrible position but you are overlooking your son, his emotional health and what he likes and wants to do.

I am so sorry you're having to go through this first with your wife then with your daughter. \n\nI understand where your son is coming from, because he's having to live a life both where he lost his mom, he's likely to lose his sister, and he's having to sacrifice a lot of being a normal kid with his dad because of it. \n\nThis is the kind of situation where you need to have a very serious conversation with your son and let him know that you're still his parent, you still love him, and you'll try the absolute best you can to be there for him for all the things in his life. Unfortunately, at the same time, you have to try your best to get as much time with your daughter, and for him- his sister as possible, given how insanely finite it seems to be. \n\nFor doctor's appointments to discuss treatments, yes, those are extremely important. I don't know if those are things that you can try to squeeze into the same day or a different day so you can occasionally go to your son's events. But if there's ANY wiggle room, both your kids deserve your best efforts to be there for them throughout all of this. \n\nIf his thing HAS to take a backseat to her treatment, discuss it with him before hand and try to make it up to him.", "YTA. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly hard, and I don\u2019t think I would do any better. \n\nThat being said, your focus on doing everything possible with your daughter is causing you to miss some of the most important moments of your son\u2019s life. He is a young man who is struggling with the loss of his mother, the imminent loss of his sister, and now a father who doesn\u2019t make time to support him.\n\nHe is at an incredibly emotionally vulnerable age and needs a father-figure to help guide him.

You need to find a balance.", "NAH - I don't think I would call you an AH, however, it does sound like your daughter's illness is taking you away from your son. He's basically telling you straight out that's feeling hurt from your neglect. It's perfectly understandable that you have to devote so much time to your daughter, but you absolutely MUST carve out time for him too. \n\nConsider that he's going through so much. His mother just passed away, his twin sister has cancer and his father is so wrapped up in that, that he can't make time for him.

Can't some of your other family step in a help you?", "I'm sorry for your loss and the fact your daughter has such a horrible illness. Keep in mind Aaron is going through a hard time as well.

Right before that happened you were dealt another crushing blow in finding out that you are also going to lose your daughter, your son is going to lose his sister, and your daughter is dealing with the crushing blow that she will likely never see her eighteenth birthday.\n\nThere is no right way to deal with this. Your feeling like you need to prioritize the time you've got left with your daughter, is completely natural. It's also natural that your son is going to be feeling overlooked. Especially while he's struggling with the loss of his mom, and the impending loss of his sister. \n\nBoth of your kids need you to show up for them right now, and in different ways. Your son needs to know that you're to be there for him, and not just after your daughter is gone. They both need you right now, and while I understand how important these doctors appointments are, you also need to push for different appointment times if they conflict with things that are really important to your son sometimes. \n\nIf you try to defer that responsibility to your son, until after your daughter has passed, you will be left with a relationship with your son that may be unsalvageable.

This will shape the kind of adult and potential father that Aaron turns into. \n\nI don\u2019t doubt for a moment that he is fully aware of his sister\u2019s condition and limited time. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not still painful for him to be losing time with his father (and only remaining parent) because of it. I\u2019m not saying you need to neglect Jennifer for Aaron, but it\u2019s important that you set aside time just for Aaron.

There can be no other judgement given the impossible circumstances you are currently facing and what you, as a family unit, have been through.

I mean, she\u2019s be fairly close if your son is in school but staying with her at the moment. You can use that proximity to your advantage here to help your son.\n\nHave the aunt come and either stay entirely with your family (if that\u2019s possible) or see if she would be willing to stay for long periods of time (given space) if not. She sounds like someone who is supportive (giving you advice and helping your son) so her additional presence would help off-set you being a solo parent dealing with all of this by yourself. You need the help, especially now. \n\nHer direct presence would also allow you more one-on-one time with your son and while your daughter is understandably attached to you and afraid, it would give her another person who can be there with/for her when you are with your son (barring appointments, etc).\n\nWhat you should be doing right now, in addition to immediate therapy for your entire family unit, is taking steps to address the \u201cwhat comes after\u201d. Please forgive my bluntness here but, once the dust settles and all is said and done, it will be you and your son dealing with the aftermath of horrible circumstances. Not only this, but your son is likely to be 18 and ready for college meaning he will also be very tempted to run to \u201cget away\u201d and that could have serious consequences for any future relationship you have with him. \n\nIm not at all saying you should neglect your daughter in any way; quite the contrary.

You\u2019ve mentioned living relatives that help you since your wife died, if it\u2019s possible, see if they\u2019re able to go to maybe one or two of your daughters appointments so you can spend some time with your son. Just dedicate a day to him every once in a while, and have one of those relatives or a close trusted friend on hand to be with your daughter. Just may giving him some time here and there will show him you do care, and should help fix the crumbling relationship. If you dedicate all your time to your daughter, which everyone can under with these circumstances, it might cause your son into isolation, and any relationship you have together will be lost when she finally passes as well.

So are his kids.\n\nNo one is an asshole.\n\nOP - I want to acknowledge that my husband and I are in a different situation in that our son doesn't fully understand what is happening and we can trade off kid duties. That said, I would recommend involving both your kids in conversations about how you should divide your time moving forward. They are old enough to understand that you are only one person and that trade-offs must happen. Cancer makes it feel like we can't control anything, so maybe finding ways to let your son (and daughter) feel \"in control\" of something, even little things, will help. Get your SIL in on the action if she's willing.\n\nIn solidarity.", "This will sound harsh but it doesn't matter if you don't purposely neglect your son. You still do. You all need some family therapy.\n\nDon't ignore your son's words because he will remember this for a long time. This could bitter your relationship in the long run. He lost his mum and he's losing his sister - his mental well-being shouldn't be neglected. \n\nDo something before you regret it.", "YTA but I understand your reasoning. However, you are focusing so much on him, all you will do is lose both children. He will never let you in again when he becomes an adult.\n\nDaughter may be clingy, but you should still tell her you need to be there for your son.", "NAH. You're all just going through a sad and very tough situation. Does your son know about his sister's prognosis?", "Soft YTA. Your son has lost his mother, losing his sister, and his dad is missing out on everything he deems important. He is the glass child right now and instead of validating his feelings you told him to quit yelling because once again its about his sisters needs. He just needs you to listen and care and it doesnt seem like you are on how you put it in the post. You are in a horrible situation but so is he so be easy on the kid and maybe pay some attention to him to. Did you even ask him about the finals(stop calling it a game its not just a ordinary game its his finals and that\u2019s important to him dont diminish that)?", "First, my condolences for your loss and your child's illness.\n\nYTA\n\nYou are neglecting Aaron, and ignoring his accomplishments for another child and then chastised him for upsetting the same child.   You're the only parent he has, and you've abandoned him.\n\nAnd this is not just about this championship game.  This is about ALL of the games, events, etc that you've missed.  The aunt could have taken your sick kid to an appointment here and there.  It's the final straw, not the ONLY straw.", "YTA\n\nYour son has lost his mom, he's losing his twin, and he feels like he has lost his dad. Your response to him has to keep that in mind. It does sound like he's being neglected. I don't think it's fair to call him an asshole in this situation. You have to find a way to keep parenting him while still being there for your daughter.", "YTA - you\u2019re going to end up losing your whole family.", "I am sorry your daughter is sick but I am going to say you don't know anyone's time on this planet. \n\nYou could focus completely on your daughter and postpone your son because you think you have plenty of time. And then find out the hard way you don't. \n\nYou shouldn't put one child over the other because you have no idea who is truly going to leave first. \n\nShe could live longer than the doctors think and your son could have an accident in a car and be gone tomorrow.  \n\nI have to give you a YTA because you can't just set your son on a shelf and pick him back up later.", "No one is the asshole here it\u2019s incredible how many of you are calling this man the asshole. It\u2019s a horrible situation have some compassion for everyone involved.", "He is angry and has every right.. but it is not you he is angry at..  you are just the only one left to vent on. Maybe he just needs to get away for a while", "Soft Yta.  You\u2019ve lost your wife, you re losing your daughter and you will lose your son if you continue to treat him this way.  This isn\u2019t fair to any of you.  But you are doing your son a great disservice.  In the end, it\u2019s going to be you and your son.  He needs you and you need him.  You cannot neglect one child because the other is sick.", "It sucks because it seems you\u2019re losing both kids.", "Be careful, your love and attentiveness towards your daughter is likely to result in losing your son when she\u2019s dead.  Try to balance your time between them both and as a family together.", "NAH, but you need to make changes fast. \n\nI am so sorry that you have lost your wife and that your daughter is also passing, I can only imagine your pain and I am sure you\u2019re doing the best you can right now. \n\nBut you need to find ways to be there for your son, who has lost his mother and is losing his *twin*. And I\u2019m guessing it feels like he\u2019s losing his dad too, not at all your intention, but I can see that from his pov. \n\nDoes the hospital or your daughter\u2019s clinics have social workers or welfare officers? They can help you navigate this. Or seek out a family therapist, possibly just you at first to start getting some ideas, strategies and also some care for your broken heart. \n\nI\u2019m hoping you and your children can spend some wonderful times together, building memories for you and your son to share in the future and to make your daughter\u2019s time loving and without extra drama. Maybe their aunt could take your daughter to some appointments? Maybe you could find a way to take your daughter to your son\u2019s games (this may not be possible)? \n\nIt\u2019s a positive sign that your son is still in contact with his sister, he\u2019s not blaming her and wants that connection. With some changes I hope all three of you can reconnect. \n\nTake care.", "Gentle YTA. Your son needs a parent as badly as your daughter does. His grief and fear don\u2019t magically dissolve because his twin is sick- in fact I\u2019m sure he\u2019s incredibly distressed because of his twin\u2019s illness.

There's no \"YTA\" or \"NTA\" here. This family is going through traumatic circumstances that is unbelievable in most cases.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to handle a situation like this where everyone wins. I think this family needs therapy and help for every individual involved. The boy doesn't realize how shit he's going to feel being overwhelmed by emotions after he grows up. This poor family deserves every bit of luck I could give them and I'm so sorry you have to go through this OP. \n\nStay strong.", "This is just heartbreaking. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna trust you when you say \"I just couldn't go to his match\" the day of the final. There's many people here saying that doesn't make sense time wise, but I get that's probably not why. I can only imagine that you're suffering more grief than anyone here can truly fathom and you must be completely drained. \n\nAll that said, you have to realise how Aaron feels if this is how it's been ever since the diagnosis. It's a testament to how you and your wife raised him that he's mature enough to be understanding most of the time. Realise though, he's suffering just as much as you and being there for him will be beneficial for both of you. Think of the joy you could have by seeing him in his final, and also the joy you'd bring him by cheering him on. Keep talking to him, and just explain that you're really struggling. You guys need to be each other's rocks going forward.\n\nIt's also worth talking to Jennifer about this. It's completely understandable that with her diagnosis and prognosis, she won't naturally be tuned into how hard this is for you and your son. I certainly wouldn't be able to think about anything other than my own rotten situation if I were her. But again, while you can be there for her, she can be there for you too. Maybe when you don't have the strength to go to your son's next big event, she might be able to give you the strength, and maybe she might want to go too. \n\nI'm actually crying here, this is just so hard and sad. I know how easy it is for us men to feel like we just have to bottle it all up and be strong for our families and not show how much we're hurting. But you and your kids are all going to have more hard moments. Breaking down in front of your kids is *nothing to be ashamed of*. This is unbelievably hard stuff. Likewise if you go to your son's game and break down, that's OK. Not one person will think any less of you, and I'm certain that lots of people will support you. \n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, I really hope you can heal with your son, and I pray that your daughter beats all the odds. Good luck \ud83d\ude4f", "As someone with terminal cancer, I'm going to say you're probably coming at this the wrong way. \n\nJennifer has limited time left, yes, but she probably wants to spent that time with everyone she loves, not just you. \n\nYour son is grieving the loss of his mother, (as if your daughter) and his twin, now his father is backing away. \n\nYou all three need to come together and form a family unit so you can all spend time together. \n\nYes, I have limited time left, but I do not want that time to me all about me. I want it tome spent with the people I love, and that means doing things they or we all like. \n\nI think you need to sit them both down and admit you're out of your depth here (quite understandably, you're grieving too) and ask them for their help and suggestions. It's okay to admit you don't have all the answers, and to ask your children if not for help, then for their suggestions. Maybe your daughter would have wanted to go to the game. \n\nMy feeling, even when to comes to things like missing treatments, os that it's about quality of life, not just quantity. Yes, I missed some debilitating chemo so I could attend  my niece's wedding. Maybe it shortened the time I have left, maybe not, but I don't regret that, and I never will. \n\nYou all need to be making memories together, and your daughter getting to be with those she loves. Ask them both for some activities they want to do (my family calls this my \"buckets of fun\" list rather than my bucket list) and then plan once or twice a month to do a couple of activities from the list. Most of my list is simple things, because it's not about the activity per se (although sharing new experiences does make for a good time) it's mostly an excuse for me to spent time with those I love. \n\nStop, take a deep breath, and let it out slowly. You're frantic right now, and I get that, but calm down and take a step back. don't rush through these remaining years, they'll go quickly enough without you being too frazzled to enjoy your children. \n\nDoctor's appointments can be changed or rescheduled, nothing calamitous is going to happen if you drop one of the balls you're juggling. In fact, put all the balls down right now, turn your phone off, and go be with your family. Tomorrow you can decide together which balls are worth picking up. \n\nAnd maybe tomorrow, you can all take the day off together and just be a family for a little while, have the discussion I mentioned above, and have a movie and duvet day. \n\nYou might also want to consider family and individual therapy for you all. This is a difficult time and you're all going to face issues that it would be beneficial to be able to talk through in a safe environment.", "I\u2019m so sorry, OP. While I can never understand your exact situation, I can empathize. I too had a spouse die, and while my daughter doesn\u2019t have cancer, she does have a condition that can cause life threatening flare ups every few months. My other daughter doesn\u2019t always understand this.\n\nAfter a few years, I had to recognize that the other kid needs one on one attention too, and sometimes, the best solution is to treat things like they are \u201cnormal\u201d. While it\u2019s natural to want to cater to your daughter and cling to her, that doesn\u2019t help anyone. Your son NEEDS your attention too. You need to suck it up and go to the games. Not all of the games, but all the ones that you can. Doctors in the morning mean you can do the night games - it would actually be good to go out and get out of your head for a while. And if Jennifer can\u2019t handle the noise, she will have to start acknowledging that she too has a brother, and either do something for him, or stay by herself for a time. \n\nThe most gentle of YTA. It sucks, and is not fair at all, but you have to do this. It will get easier. You\u2019ll get the rhythm.

YTA. They both have needs.  You are FAILING one.  Your actions, you are well on your way to losing both.\n\nI doubt if this was the only game you missed that your son would have blown up.  Yes, your daughter is sick and will die soon (ish).  But do you honestly think after YEARS of being put second or last (given your wife and daughter were sick at the same time) your son will want anything to do with you?  Do you expect to miss many important to him events, then your daughter dies, and then somehow magickly your son will welcome you back?\n\nI get it.  You can't be two places at once.  On times where you absolutely CAN'T be there for your son, it is your job to ensure that another adult he loves and trust is there.   It is important for you to accept your son's point of view.  You only lost a wife so far.  He lost his mom.  He also lost his dad because you are not there for what is important to him.  His sister, sick or not, is getting preferential treatment and is getting the short end of the stick.\n\nAlso, you were more concerned about your daughter's pain then your son's.  People don't yell at others when everything is right in their world.  Your son was feeling abandoned because you DID abandon him for your daughter.  And then you wanted him to hurt more by holding in his pain, so his sister, who although she doesn't mean to, is stealing away the time and attention he needs too?\n\nI am SHOCKED that he still wants contact with his sister.

Why can't you and your daughter go to your son's games? Why can't she enjoy having a normal family life until she can't anymore? Why is it one or the other? What you're doing is making it so not even your daughter knows what it means to give love, not just get. YTA, and my heart breaks for your son.

Usually Aaron is understanding of this but it seems not this time.\n\nHis team had gone to the finals and were playing a game and he wanted me to come but the doctor had called us earlier on in the day talking about potential treatments and I just couldn't go to his match.\n\nHe came home mad and upset about how I had missed a game, I'd be fine with him expressing his anger but the level he was yelling at was simply too much and Jennifer is very sensitive to loud noises. When I tried to explain this he said that I was being a total dickhead and neglecting him.\n\nAaron has been staying with his aunt since that argument and has not been contacting me, only Jennifer\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sometimes you just have to do the best you can.  The only advice I could think to give is maybe make it where the aunt can legally go with your daughter occasionally too.  That way if there is something that can not be missed she can go with your daughter and keep you updated and be with your daughter so you can be with your son more.

He's going to remember all the times you decided he wasn't worth any of your effort. And what happens if God willing your daughter lives longer than 3 years? How long will you let your son be an afterthought? Will you miss his graduation, wedding, him becoming a father, so you can focus exclusively on your daughter?\n\nYou are trying your best for your daughter. I can not imagine how painful this is for you. But if you continue with this mindset that you don't have to put any effort into your son because your daughter is sick. If you continue thinking it's ok to just skip out entirely on major moments of his life because you can't make it in time, then you are going to realize too late that you lost both your kids.", "You need to be realistic OP. Doctors don't give a terminal prognosis lightly. Your kids and yourself need to go to therapy. If your daughter can go to school, obviously she can be away from you, so that's a crappy excuse to not spend time with your son. I'm a mother too and my heart breaks for you, but you need to give yourself a reality check and  realize you aren't doing your best here. Take 15-20 minutes to cry in your car every day, then take a shower and reset mentally and plan your day and time with your kids. Even if it's just an hour or two dedicated to your son. He shares the same genetics as your wife and his twin, he could be scared too about becoming sick and is trying to have normalcy. He needs support too, and you're failing. Cancer runs heavily in my family as well. Most of my relatives have died from it before hitting 70, if not decades earlier. I cannot imagine the pain you're going through, and you need to dedicate time and space to let it out and then be there emotionally and physically for both children, same as if one wasn't very ill.

OP is making his son feel invisible and completely unimportant to him. His son really didn't ask for much, and apparently doesn't get upset about being ignored so much of the time. OP really doesn't have an excuse for missing that game; his child is suffering, and apparently getting very little attention or help from his father, but OP had a chance to demonstrate that his son *does* matter to him, and *isn't* invisible, and he completely blew it.", "That is plenty of time to alienate his son.\n\nOP, your son's emotional needs are just as important as your daughter's.

In the same period that OP lost his wife & his daughter's diagnosis, Aaron has been dealing with losing his mother and facing the loss of his twin. Depending on how long ago his mother's cancer was discovered, loss is overshadowing a good portion of his older childhood. And he feels abandoned by his father too because emotionally, he has been. He's 15 and if he's left to process all the losses as best he can alone until he's adult, he's not going to easily bond with his father afterwards. Aaron is still reaching out by inviting him to things. He will stop after enough disappointments.\n\nIt's not just a case of \"he'll forgive him when he's older\".

All he sees is he doesn\u2019t matter anymore. \nUnfortunately this is the time the child is going to remember, the time that will have the biggest impact on his life.

I\u2019d not have it in me to call you an AH. \n\nBut I will say that if you continue down this path, you\u2019re going to lose both children, because Aaron is going to be so resentful he\u2019s not going to want to anything to do with you. \n\nI understand Jennifer is terrified about her prognosis. But you can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that your son also just lost his mother. And now he likely feels like he\u2019s lost his father as well. \n\nYou have to put him first at times too. Have a standing dinner each week just the two of you. Go to the important games. And when there is a conflicts, reschedule what you can. And, of course, if it can\u2019t be rescheduled, then the medical appointments have to come first. \n\nBut you have to figure something out so that you don\u2019t end up losing him too. \n\nAlso, if you aren\u2019t already, you all need therapy.

And how AWFUL you\u2019d feel at being told this. And this is really where OP is heading if he doesn\u2019t address or at least have an adult talk with his son. \nOP you need to address your son. Get him in the loop, tell him everything, he\u2019s old enough to understand, and involve him with you and his sister too. And he can miss school too. Can always graduate later just focus on family right now. He lost his mother and his sisters dying too. That\u2019s a LOT. But do it at his own face. Talk to him. Be honest with him.

His focus, also understandably, has not been on the twin son who not just lost his mom but will soon lose his twin sister. He's not TA, but neither is his son. He needs to find some way to be there for him as well, because he also needs support. It's going to be hard for OP to divide his time between them. Hence my NAH judgement.", "Yeah my best friends little sister got heart cancer. It was awful to see that girl go through the pain and suffering (thankfully she recovered and is now a happy and thriving adult) but it was just as awful to see my best friend and their older brother be completely neglected.

He tried working in spite of it the second time even during chemo because he valued the health and wellbeing of his patients. I was working in his office shredding documents at the time. After hours of surgery he\u2019d sit in his office and it looked like someone had beaten the crap out of him. It was painful to watch but it helped me understand and mentally prepare for the inevitable. My siblings ignored it, pretended everything was fine and thought \u201che\u2019ll get better and everything will be normal again\u201d.
