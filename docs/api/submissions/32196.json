If he sees men perving over you, he can call them out, not ask you to change a perfectly acceptable form of beachwear. As for his daughter, you were absolutely correct.", "Tbf, we can't have a clear picture of that bikini \ud83e\udd14", "I mean, it sounds as if he took your rebuttal well. Dad's, are charged with protecting their young daughters, nieces, etc...ofcourse he was in teenage years, and 20 somethings, he may remember how immature he acted towards pretty young ladies with what is considered attractive figures.  The fact that you spoke up adult-like may have been all he needed to hear to know you can handle yourself.  B e.z. on the Ole Unc... guy does not sound like he was committed to being asshole-y.", "Nope, but how many checked to see if she had any pics on her profile...just to make an informed decision.", "NTA\n\nIf he looks at his niece and thinks that other men will sexualise her, then technically he is also guilty of sexualising the situation. Which, in my opinion, makes the scenario all the creepier for him to mention. Does that mean when his daughter eventually wears a bikini then he'll experience the same thoughts and feelings towards her?\n\nI've never really had a deep thought on this subject until the last few years, but why is it we men can wear Speedos and trunks to swimming without anyone batting an eyelid, which is essentially underwear, so why are women sexualised while we aren't criticized?", "He is sexualizing you and perving himself, hate to say it", "NTA: you are right , as an adult, 18, he doesnt have a say", "NTA, but you missed the opportunity to point out his hypocrisy as he was the one being pervy and sexualizing women.", "When men say they are worried about others sexualizing you they are the ones sexualizing you. NTA.", "NTA. Your uncle has no say in what you wear. As for his daughter, instead of trying to shame you about your bathing suit, he could have talked to her on his own to explain as her father why he\u2019d prefer she wear one pieces until she is 18.", "NTA.\n\nYou are a grown-ass adult. You get to choose your own clothes. The one exception is that if you still live with your parents, I might say \"Their house, their rules.\" But you weren't in your parents' house when this happened, and it wasn't your parents telling you what to do.\n\nAlso, I agree with you that your cousin is going to see other women in bikinis on the beach. He needs to help her understand that women's bodies are okay, not be shaming you.", "NTA\n\nIn Germany, some women are topless at the beach.\n\nAnd that's totally fine. \n\nWe're no perverts.", "NTA. Why did I just know you were a girl when I read the title. \ud83d\ude44", "Omg. I bet you were flashing your ankles as well. \n\nThe only way for a lady to sufficiently protect her modesty is to use a Victorian bathing machine, which is basically a shed on wheels that you push into the sea. \n\nYou will have to excuse me while I make my way to the fainting couch.", ">I just became blunt with him\n\nI suspect neither of you were at your best in the way you handled it.  You're \"an adult.\" Are you saying that 12 months ago you would have done what he asked...?\n\nNote I'm not calling you out for the bathing suit, only for your part in how the conversation went down.", "NTA.", "NAH. You are an adult and responded reasonably and appropriately. I can also understand your Uncle's point of view, because it is a very different conversation with a teen when they can show siblings / cousins as examples as opposed to general public. He was probably trying to make his own life easy but it's great that he didn't let it ruin anyone's day when he was faced with someone who didn't agree with him.", "one of two things was going on- he was imagining the horrible things men would think about women your age and it made him mad, because he is a good uncle. Or he was getting turned on and realized it was wrong and tried to get you to stop doing it. He seems more like he is the good-uncle type. he is just not wanting men to think that way about you", "NTA\n\nAnd....  I don't want to plant a thought unfairly against him, but in these situations I have to wonder whether it's the family member perving; that is, that they can't entirely control themselves and end up staring, so rather than being a decent person and *not*, they ask the target of their leering to cover up.\n\nAt any rate, you're an adult. And if you weren't, he's still not your *parent*.", "He probably cheered up because there were infact other women there in bikinis that he could sexualise without feeling weird about it", ">said that her daughter is gonna see other women in bikinis there anyway and that he frankly doesn't have a say in what I wear to the beach anymore now that I'm an adult.\n\nNothing more needs to be said.\n\nNTA", "NTA - as you said, he does not get a say in what you wear, and what you were wearing was appropriate to the venue.  If you showed up to dinner in a bikini, sure, you are inappropriately attired.", "Exactly this.", "Does that apply to everything, or just sexualization ?", "More upvotes for this!", "the life we live eh", "How scandalous! I would never flash my ankles. Anything but that", "yess! It was a minor disagreement and I'm glad he didn't let it ruin the trip so far. He's been perfectly normal today as well :)", "What?"]}
