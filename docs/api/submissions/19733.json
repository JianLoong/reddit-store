We are both private people, but he comes from a culture that celebrates people, noise, parties, socialization, events, etc. \n\nHis (Dave's) family knows his preferences and personality regarding privacy/sociability and it has been a consistent source of tension for his entire life.\n\nDave states that they ignore his comments and/or choose not to care, and they urge him to partake in their events regardless. This has led him to feeling disconnected to his family, so now a mostly superficial relationship remains with his family (siblings and sometimes parents).\n\nAnyway, partner and I agreed years ago that we didn't want a wedding. We don't want to celebrate our marriage in a traditional sense (wedding, venue, cake, party, people): We just want to do our own thing with no external intervention. \n\nSo when we actually decided to begin the paperwork process, we were told at the county office that we could legally marry right then and there. This was not our intention upon arriving to the office, but since we didn't care about the extra stuff, we were like \"why the hell not?\". And then we were married that day.\n\nDays prior to us marrying, I had told my parents that we were going to get married soom and were not going to have a wedding. They were cool with it bc they had done the same. My partner did not want to tell his family beforehand. He did not want to deal with backlash regarding a lack of wedding; that, or they would insist on providing a wedding. \n\nIt was one of those situations where he found it easier to make his decision first and then tell after. I supported his decision either way. \n\nWell, we get married. We leave the office, step in the car. I post it on Facebook. Before we make any calls, his sister calls us and is upset that he didn't tell her ahead of time; that it was rude not to let their family know prior. We call his parents and his mom begins to cry; she feels left out and is upset that she wasn't included or told beforehand. \n\nHe states that it just happened two minutes ago and we are telling them as soon as it happened. And they are even more upset to find out we will not have a wedding.\n\nNow, 1 year later June 2023, our marriage decision/lack of wedding has been mentioned at almost every family dinner by his sister or mom.\n\n And it's annoying the fuck out of me. Neither my partner or me or confrontational people, but since it is his family, he has stated to them that this was what we wanted: our marriage, our decision. We are happy.\n\nBut the comments keep coming, like his words mean nothing (again, the reason for their weak relationship).We acknowledge their feelings. But this is literally why we don't like making our relationship public.\n\nWIBTA if I just tell them to stop with the comments and just accept the fact that we did things the way WE wanted ? And that if comments continue, we will just no longer attend family events?", "created_utc": 1686810794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149ux5o/wibta_if_i_tell_my_inlaws_to_accept_our_marriage/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They just need to get over it.\n\nBut in reality, what are the chances that they are actually going to listen and accept what you're saying ? The issue is not you getting married without a wedding. The issue is the relationship and dynamic between your partner and his family. They don't respect him. Never have. What makes you think they're going to start ? Especially if you're the one standing up to them while he says nothing.\n\nIs that even what your partner wants ? For you to say something ? To not see his family anymore if they don't stop ?", "Your husband needs to establish boundaries with his family, not you. You can back him up but he needs to lay down the law.\nIn the meantime, try to rise above and laugh at this. There is far more power in humor and detachment than anger.", "YTA (YWBTA) because that needs to come from him, not you.\n\nYou can choose not to engage or attend events until he has that conversation. That\u2019s fully okay and fully in your power. But he needs to manage his own relationship with his own family.\n\nAlso YTA for posting about your marriage on Facebook before he\u2019d told his family.", "NAH\n\nEasy to see from their point of view. They found out their son was married via a Facebook post. I imagine things would be a little different if they were either told beforehand, or if they were at least told afterwards before it was posted to social media.", "YWNBTA  \n\n\nYour marriage is about you and your partner - not anyone else. While they're allowed to feel disappointed, they're not allowed to make it about them. You're in the right, and if they don't like it, you're not being rude by telling them to back down.", "NTA. You are perfectly within your right to enjoy your privacy and they need to get over it. Considering they can't seem to let things go and your husband already basically is just putting on a retail worker mask whenever he is around them, perhaps consider reducing contact with them further, either until they finally agree to drop things, or just permanently as it sounds like being around them is just draining for you both.", "you would be NTA \n\nThey need to drop it and let it go", "NTA and you should tell them, the only tiny thing I think was a bit ESH is that you posted it before telling his parents (and siblings)", "NTA. He is exactly right. Your marriage, your decision. They are being so dramatic crying over nothing and making everything about them. This would be annoying as hell and you'd be in the right to calmly, even cheerily tell them to stop and that if they are unable to, then you'll be unable to attend. Anything. Ever", "NTA hun. I'd have cut them off sooner. It's time to put them all in time out for awhile.", "NTA. You need to set your boundary and be clear with them.", "NTA. Your relationship is what matters, not someone else's desire to make lots of noise at a party. It's time for them to shut up.", "NTA You would not be the asshole for telling your in-laws to accept your marriage decision. I was in a similar situation and found anytime it was brought up (over & over) I said the same line-\n\n\u201cwe kindly ask you to respect our decision regarding our marriage. It was a choice we made based on what felt right for us. Your understanding and acceptance would be greatly appreciated.\"\n\nAnd then was shortened to \u201cPlease respect our decision. It was the right choice for us.\"\n\nEventually I did say to one of my aunts that if she wanted to, she was welcome to throw a wedding the way she wanted for herself and whomever but it might have been a bit AH move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s the YTA way of bringing it up and the NTA way of bringing it up. Approach the conversation with the perspective of \u201cI\u2019d like to discuss this once and for all to offer everyone some closure\u201d and this will probably lead to a friendly win/win discussion for everyone. \n\nYou will need to be mindful of their feelings when doing so, because while marriage is a personal decision between you and your husband, you both willingly took actions that you knew would disrespect and upset his family (even if this action was a \u201cspur of the moment\u201d kind of thing). Like it or not you marry family as much as each other and while that doesn\u2019t mean you have to cater to their demands, it does mean you should at least remind them that you respect them and love them especially after doing something that knowingly upset them.", "NTA for telling your in laws to respect your marriage desicion but YTA for posting about the marriage on Facebook before letting your husband tell his family himself that he was married. It's almost as if you wanted the confrontation with his family by posting it on Facebook first", "Nta\n\nI'm the same way. Hate big events, especially if I'm the focus.\n\nThe wedding (and marriage) is about the two people getting married. No other opinion  matters. \n\nIt has happened. It's done with. They can either accept it or not. And if they don't, don't tolerate their opinions because, at the end of the day, it comes down to you and your spouse.", "That is a good question. I brought up this exact scenario to him and he is okay with the proposal WITH the condition that he warns them sternly on the side first. \n\nI don't think Dave realized how upset their comments made me (the anger grew over time); when I explained to him that this has been bothering me for a while, it was like a lighbulb appeared above his head. Because he is so used to his family ignoring his feelings, he grew up to ignore their comments and not let them bother him. Dave apologized when he realized that his coping mechanism to ignore his family was not how I personally wanted to deal with their comments lol if that makes sense\n\n\nEdit for grammar", "I strongly disagree with the N A H. After one whole year they should drop it. At a certain point it drives you insane to say the same sh** again and again and again.", "I think that you can choose not to see them anymore if you don't want to deal with their disrespect but that you can't make Dave go very LC or NC very them. This has to be his decision. And for while, you might have to accept that he is going to see his family without you.\n\nYou're also going to have to accept that this is not going to go away with some boundaries or by just not seing them. If your partner is not ready to stand up for himself against his family, the issue is going to be there always. He might even decide to go NC and then, if you get pregnant for example, or if he goes to a difficult time at work, he's going to get back in touch with them and you're going to end up in the position you're in right now. \n\nYou need to set boundaries and rules with your partner and he needs to set boundaries and rules with his family.", "Nta.\n\nEvery time they make a comment, get up and leave.    Tell them why.  Consistently.", "NTA. And the strategy you propose is exactly right. A clear request and warning. Then no contact if they persist.", "So you gave your family a heads up you two were get married that week and they weren't invited and there would be no celebration. Your husband chose not to give his family the same heads up. His family found out you were married from your social media post. Sounds like you went straight from boyfriend and girlfriend to husband and wife, so they really knew nothing until your Facebook post announcing your marriage. \n\nI'm sorry but this is the consequence of your husband actions. He knew his family was going to be hurt by his choice not to have a wedding. He chose not to forewarn them. He didn't want to have an uncomfortable conversation. He didn't even ask you not to update your social media until after he'd given his family a courtesy phonecall/text/email/group WhatsApp message, informing them he'd eloped. Your in-laws found out you got married from a Facebook post and you're annoyed they aren't over their hurt in a year. Your husband chose not to give his family the bare minimum respect. This is the consequence of that. And you need to put on your big girl pants and accept that until they receive an sincere apology, they are always going to make little remarks about the time they found out their son got married from Facebook. Especially during periods when other relatives are getting married. And maybe even after they receive an apology. I'm sorry but your husband was TA to his family in this situation. YWBTA to tell them to get over it. He's an adult. Adults don't get to skip difficult conversations and then be annoyed when people lose respect for you.", "NTA. Your marriage. I get his fam has their own way,but they think this is about them. Its not about you and your husband must work it out with his family,it sounds like they unfortunately dont care about him though. \n\nAnd btw,if I ever marry,this is how I want to do it,that or at the courthouse/private ceremony at home with only family. I really dont want a party. I dont do those. Maybe a dinner,but thats it.", "Nah.   If husband is unwilling or unable to handle it, she can say it.   They're treating her poorly too.", "Any conversation with his family on matters like this should be for Dave to undertake."]}
