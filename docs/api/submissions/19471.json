We take him back to our place and start calling relatives. His parents, grandparents, even my wife's parents, anyone we can think of to come get him. At this point it's going on 1 AM and everyone had a long day with the wedding so we understood why no one was answering.

We texted numerous family members to let them know where he was and that he'd likely need a ride in the morning.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, Andy contacted us and was fuming because he has received his ER bill. He's demanding that we pay at least half because he never asked us to take him to the ER (he doesn't remember anything about the night, but he's not wrong). We're refusing because unless we wanted to miss our flight, we really had no choice. Plus he wasn't keeping food or sports drinks down so we thought it would be safest for him.

He's an adult and should take responsibility for his actions and bills.", "NTA. You tell Andy that he is a an adult and is supposed to be responsible for his safety and health. You also let him know that HE was the one who made the stupid decision to get completely drunk and trashed to the point where he vomited all over the place. If Andy protests again, block his number and contact information completely. He sounds irresponsible, stupid and entitled. Congrats OP on your wedding and blessings for a happy marriage!", "NTA. He chose to drink, he chose to get snockered, and he should have chosen to drink responsibly in the beginning. Also, by you taking him to the ER, you did the responsible thing to make sure he did not have alcohol poisoning of some sort. If he was a lightweight drinker, he should have stayed that way at your wedding reception and that responsibility falls completely on him.\n\nHe is obviously an adult, and you and your new bride are not his keepers. That responsibility should have never been put on you in the first place, he should have drank responsibly or at least make sure he had a decent backup ride before he started drinking, not a ride from the bride and groom.", "Well, you could have called 911 to deal with him.

He should be grateful not charging you.", "NTA", "NTA You did what you thought was best for his safety. It was quite possible he had alcohol poisoning needed to be in the ER anyway.", "YTA. ERs are not there as a dumping ground for inconvenient drunks, and your decision to use one cost him a lot of money.", "Agree.  Considering that no family members were available it would have completely irresponsible to do anything else.", "And he'd have had an additional bill for the ambulance on top of the ER bill.", "Overnight with fluids and monitoring, no stomach pump, would still likely be a couple thousand dollars depending on insurance.", "Thanks. Could he get free basic care if he doesn't have insurance?\n\nIn any case, he is entirely to blame for his predicament. It would be nice to think that he would learn from his lesson, but probably not.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you get so drunk you can't remember what happened then it is your own fault.

Tell him not to drink if he can't hold his booze and block him for a while (or forever).", "NTA he knew he had to drive home and didn't care for himself properly.
