Would you have appreciated his honesty? YTA", "YTA (Edited from E S H after OP's reply). Your niece is 16, she's old enough to know not to trash-talk someone's dress choices to their face, and to know their wedding suit is a big deal to most people. Sure, she might have just tried to be witty or whatever, but unless she and your fianc\u00e9 have a very close, banter-y type of relationship, this was NOT the time or place to make such a silly comment. So she's an asshole and doesn't get a pass due to her age, rather the opposite.\n\nYou handled the situation as poorly as possible. Maybe laughing initially was an innocent mistake, but once you saw your fianc\u00e9 was clearly offended you should've defused the situation and tell him you'd speak to your niece about her attitude. Instead you chose to join in the trashing of his outfit , defend a teenager's rude words, and basically told him \"if you wear this you'll be a laughingstock but hey, I support you if that's what you want!\" - Is this what you mean when you say you love his \"unique way of dressing\"? Way to show what a good partner you'll be, OP. You're an asshole.\n\nFinally, your fianc\u00e9 is, I assume, an adult. While he has every right to feel offended/hurt at someone making fun of a suit he liked enough to consider wearing for his wedding day, there were about a thousand ways he could've asserted that he did not appreciate the girl's words and put her in her place that didn't involve escalating the situation the way it did. He isn't an asshole, though, he just kind of sucks for not being able to stand up for himself against a teen girl without causing drama.", "YTA.  I read your comment.  \"She is just honest\" is one of those things AH's say to excuse their assholery.\n\nApologize to your husband and maybe have a chat with your niece about the need for adults to have filters.", "In both your post and comments you seem to think this teenager's opinion is some sort of universal truth. It's weird.\n\nYTA for teaching her bad manners. Most people see that people who try and play off mean comments as 'honesty' are assholes. She's going to become very unpopular in her adulthood if she keeps it up.", "Damn I hope OP gets laughed at on her wedding day. If she even has one", "must be nice to have a niece in the dress police department. and you saying you support your husband-to-be while laughing at his face is just mean and hypocrite. \n\nYTA.", "YTA (and your niece)\n\nI agree that your niece\u2019s question is funny, but from your fianc\u00e9\u2019s perspective I can see how it\u2019s come across as a little mean-spirited. It sounds like he was feeling good about himself and her comment really took the wind out of his sails. \n\nObviously it\u2019s hard not to laugh at comments like that sometimes, but you also should have shut her down with a \u201cbut seriously, let\u2019s be a little more constructive here\u201d. There are a lot of more polite ways she could frame that observation.", "At a glance without any understanding of this man\u2019s personality, I think people often hope their style and sense of fashion will impress their loved ones and their extended family/loved ones for a big day. Especially if they try finding the vision they have of themselves laughing can feel embarrassing. \n\nLet me ask, if you tried on a wedding dress and his extended family was there and laughed what would you think? Would you assume they don\u2019t mean it or that it was funny or mean spirited?\n\nLaughter is hard to hear especially if one has no deep or meaningful relationship with all parties present. It doesn\u2019t sound like you folks have the history of humour or teasing\u2026you\u2019re not laughing with you\u2019re laughing at. Therefore YTA\n\nIf you stand by laughing without after composing yourselves and acknowledging his feelings it looks like you\u2019re standing by the niece who is 16 and not your fianc\u00e9, causing him to overthink. \u201cYou\u2019re siding with a 16 year old. You\u2019re not siding with me.\u201d These thoughts may go even deeper than the green suit. They may string to \u201cdoes the whole extended family think I\u2019m a joke? Will they all laugh at me?\u201d \n\nJust my 10cents :)", "1. That is pretty funny  \n2. You can find something amusing and still be supportive of the other person  \n3.
