And said says\n\n\"Are you ever going to let B(my ex24M) claim him?\"I said,\"Idk. He solely lives with me, I've been with him 24/7 since th3 day he was born. So I don't see why someone who rarely sees him has any right to claim K on taxes.\" He doesn't pay child support either, so I'm barely scraping by.

And I tell her.\n\n\"That doesn't stop him from texting me and asking for updates about K, especially when he's been sick with a fever of 103 and has pneumonia. \" My ex lost interest in the pregnancy after I broke up with him bc I couldn't stand his face after he had SAd me multiple times in our relationship and I still can't stand being near him without being sent into a panick attack. \n\nShe then proceeded to say.\"Well, we just want Kai to come and stay 3 to 4 days out of every week.\" And I am just shocked like what? I tell her.\"I dont feel comfortable with that. B barely can change a diaper, and he plays video games all damn night and works all day.\" Then she tries saying she feels like I don't trust her, and honestly, I don't. The last time I left this woman alone with my baby, she gave him a monster energy drink. Thst night, K had an upset tummy and didn't go to bed until 7 in the morning. \n\nK's dad did coke for Chrismas. However, He bought K toys he won't won't be able to play with until he's older, like 4 or 5. I told him 4 different times the type of things K likes and doesn't like so he could grt him a good gift. He shows up with scary toys thst made K cry snd scream and crawl to me sobbing.ive just had nothing but issue after issue with that family and I'm still learning how not to let people walk all over me, snd it's very hard. But G is upset because i won't let her claim my son on their taxes and let them keep him for 3 to 4 days..AITA?\n\nEDIT: thank you everyone for the advice and kind words. I'm definitely gonna try to go for child support once I csn gather all the evidence I need to make it so his dad doesn't have visitation at all or unless supervised.
