{"id": 6510, "submission_id": "103l9x7", "title": "AITA for not accommodating for others religious restrictions around my dog?", "selftext": "So I live in a country that has only in the past 20ish years started to see more refugees and immigrants from countries that are predominantly following the religion of Islam. My country is predominantly Protestant. Personally, if it matters, I am neither. The point I\u2019m making is that the people that have moved here tend to not have lived here for super long and the different cultures have not found a fully peaceful coexistence, due to obvious differences. \n\nThe problem I\u2019m experiencing living in an area with lots of immigrants is that they often react very strongly to me just walking past with my dog. Some people literally jump out of our way or stop in their tracks and seem super scared or didtressed. I understand dogs can be seen as dirty or something by them, but I\u2019m just really tired of being constantly reacted to in big ways.\n\nSo I\u2019ve stopped accommodating. If someone wants to go around us on the street, I no longer pull my dog away as far as I can to let them pass. I just let her be and leave the other person to deal with it or to go somewhere else to walk. Ofthen this leads to exaggerated annoyance from people that dislike dogs due to religion. We never take the full street (obviously) and others with no dog issues are able to pass normally, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing something wrong. Or if I\u2019m sitting on the train with my dog, I no longer pull her under my seat, I just let her sit on the floor like usual (which is allowed by train rules), even if it prevents someone who has issues with dogs from walking past us. Again, there would be plenty of space to do so, but they usually want me to pull my dog super tight in away from them before they can walk past. Other similar situations occur lots. \n\nI\u2019m just so over bending over to other peoples personal beliefs and don\u2019t give a crap anymore. However I recently got called an AH for this by someone who thinks that I should be more understanding towards him and his religious beliefs so I\u2019m asking reddit. AITA for this?\n\nEDIT: Before I get more comments like it, no I don\u2019t let my dog wander far from me on the street and I never let her approach passing people, no matter who they are. And if I\u2019m on the train, I go to the assigned pet carriage and she sits right next to me on the floor. However sometimes that is simply not enough to some people.\n\nEDIT 2: Ok so some comments saying I\u2019m wrong about religious reasons and it\u2019s actually cultural. That\u2019s fine, I guess I\u2019m misunderstanding the core reason, but it has previously been told to me by someone believing in Islam that him and others from his country behave that way because of religious reasons. This was back when I still went the extra mile to accommodate. To me it\u2019s irrelevant, because I only care about what the right thing to do with my dog is.

When I came to Europe I was shocked how common it is and at first I loved it because I like dogs. But then there were two incidents where 1) a dog went crazy and tried to get away from his owner to get at me and was barking so loudly and even when the owner dragged it away it was still barking viciously and then, when I was on the way back, the owner was still standing in the same spot and though I was farther away it still tried to attack me. \nAnother time, a small dog just suddenly tried to bite on the street and the owner could barely hold it back and it almost bit my hand if i hadn't pushed it's face away. I had to literally run away and I could hear the owner apologizing to me but I couldn't stop. Because of these two incidents I started developing a fear of dogs and whenever I'd see them i panic.\n\nIt's better now since it has happened in a while and I met a relative's adorable and cuddly cavalier spaniel but sometimes, when I see a big dog, I still get scared. \n\nKeep in mind that I once went to a dog festival in my home country where I was surrounded by dogs and was not scared at all because they were all friendly but that was for a few hours. I guess because i see dogs here much more the chances of running into traumatized/ badly trained  (I say this because I don't believe that animals are just violent for no reason) dogs are much higher. But my scared brain doesn't account for the fact that when I'm getting scared and sometimes I walk faster even if the dog did nothing because I'm anxious and scared. I really appreciate it when owners pull their dogs away but most times i will cross to the other side of the street or walk faster. \n\nJust saying that it's not always religious it could be anxiety from a negative previous experience.", "So most of the time you will find it is neither religious nor cultural but they are actually scared of your dog.

How would you even know their religion is beyond me, but regardless we read the same post up above right? You wrote that post so clearly maybe deal with your internalized privilege and go off? Your post was clear, you don\u2019t want to move your dog because you assume that Muslims jump away and have some kind of big reaction and you don\u2019t like said reaction so you aren\u2019t going to accommodate people walk with your dog? Lol yeah okay again big YTA, if your dog is in someone\u2019s way then move it. Point blank regardless of religion? Like super weird for you to be fixated on that but again go off.", "I am going to tell him and you that you are the best person. No questions asked.even he think so. He just wants to give you a hard time. I judge you A +++", "Isn\u2019t assholeness a judgment of the person based on the post? \n\nFor clarity, I don\u2019t think you are the greatest person based on your post.", "That was the point I was making. People that have immigrated here have not been exposed to the way my country is, just due to how little time it\u2019s been. The way you described it is so much better. English isn\u2019t my native language obviously so it can be harder to make my point super clear", ">some people may have religious reservations just about being in the vicinity of a dog\n\nAbout that, I have Muslim friends who actively avoid dogs because like you mentioned in the top comment, there are owners who are irresponsible or dogs who are unpredictable. My friends said it's easier to avoid dogs than to risk coming into contact with a dog (some friendly dogs may slobber over strangers).", "I don\u2019t find it irrelevant, because they are true. Am I supposed to pretend it\u2019s not due to religious and cultural differences between us? I\u2019m trying to give full context.", "Judging an entire person is not the point here. It\u2019s judging if I was TA in this specific situation. Whole point of the sub. Again, you don\u2019t have what it takes to judge me fully as a person even if you try."]}
