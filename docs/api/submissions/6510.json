{"id": 6510, "submission_id": "103l9x7", "title": "AITA for not accommodating for others religious restrictions around my dog?", "selftext": "So I live in a country that has only in the past 20ish years started to see more refugees and immigrants from countries that are predominantly following the religion of Islam. My country is predominantly Protestant. Personally, if it matters, I am neither. The point I\u2019m making is that the people that have moved here tend to not have lived here for super long and the different cultures have not found a fully peaceful coexistence, due to obvious differences. \n\nThe problem I\u2019m experiencing living in an area with lots of immigrants is that they often react very strongly to me just walking past with my dog. Some people literally jump out of our way or stop in their tracks and seem super scared or didtressed. I understand dogs can be seen as dirty or something by them, but I\u2019m just really tired of being constantly reacted to in big ways.\n\nSo I\u2019ve stopped accommodating. If someone wants to go around us on the street, I no longer pull my dog away as far as I can to let them pass. I just let her be and leave the other person to deal with it or to go somewhere else to walk. Ofthen this leads to exaggerated annoyance from people that dislike dogs due to religion. We never take the full street (obviously) and others with no dog issues are able to pass normally, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing something wrong. Or if I\u2019m sitting on the train with my dog, I no longer pull her under my seat, I just let her sit on the floor like usual (which is allowed by train rules), even if it prevents someone who has issues with dogs from walking past us. Again, there would be plenty of space to do so, but they usually want me to pull my dog super tight in away from them before they can walk past. Other similar situations occur lots. \n\nI\u2019m just so over bending over to other peoples personal beliefs and don\u2019t give a crap anymore. However I recently got called an AH for this by someone who thinks that I should be more understanding towards him and his religious beliefs so I\u2019m asking reddit. AITA for this?\n\nEDIT: Before I get more comments like it, no I don\u2019t let my dog wander far from me on the street and I never let her approach passing people, no matter who they are. And if I\u2019m on the train, I go to the assigned pet carriage and she sits right next to me on the floor. However sometimes that is simply not enough to some people.\n\nEDIT 2: Ok so some comments saying I\u2019m wrong about religious reasons and it\u2019s actually cultural. That\u2019s fine, I guess I\u2019m misunderstanding the core reason, but it has previously been told to me by someone believing in Islam that him and others from his country behave that way because of religious reasons. This was back when I still went the extra mile to accommodate. To me it\u2019s irrelevant, because I only care about what the right thing to do with my dog is.

When I came to Europe I was shocked how common it is and at first I loved it because I like dogs. But then there were two incidents where 1) a dog went crazy and tried to get away from his owner to get at me and was barking so loudly and even when the owner dragged it away it was still barking viciously and then, when I was on the way back, the owner was still standing in the same spot and though I was farther away it still tried to attack me. \nAnother time, a small dog just suddenly tried to bite on the street and the owner could barely hold it back and it almost bit my hand if i hadn't pushed it's face away. I had to literally run away and I could hear the owner apologizing to me but I couldn't stop. Because of these two incidents I started developing a fear of dogs and whenever I'd see them i panic.\n\nIt's better now since it has happened in a while and I met a relative's adorable and cuddly cavalier spaniel but sometimes, when I see a big dog, I still get scared. \n\nKeep in mind that I once went to a dog festival in my home country where I was surrounded by dogs and was not scared at all because they were all friendly but that was for a few hours. I guess because i see dogs here much more the chances of running into traumatized/ badly trained  (I say this because I don't believe that animals are just violent for no reason) dogs are much higher. But my scared brain doesn't account for the fact that when I'm getting scared and sometimes I walk faster even if the dog did nothing because I'm anxious and scared. I really appreciate it when owners pull their dogs away but most times i will cross to the other side of the street or walk faster. \n\nJust saying that it's not always religious it could be anxiety from a negative previous experience.", "So most of the time you will find it is neither religious nor cultural but they are actually scared of your dog.

If they want the norms of their country they can go back.\n\nYears ago there was big controversy where I live because Muslim immigrants working at grocery stores refused to scan pork and would insist the customer either scan it themselves or wait while they found a non-Muslim to scan it. That was shut down and the workers were reassigned.\n\nSame happened with a truck driver who refused to unload alcohol when he worked for a distributor and the norm is to drive to the stores and unload. No idea what happened with that guy.\n\nBut most taxi drivers here are Muslim and wanted Sharia cab, not to transport gay couples, single women or visible alcohol, like you'd traveled internationally and they could see that you had alcohol or dogs. Because common law requires a common carrier to take anyone unless they feared for safety or nonpayment the airport authorities added a guy to assign passengers to cabs and hand out a complaint form.\n\nAnother thing about cab drivers, per their muslim tradition, unaccompanied women were considered fair game and I remember reading about a 14 year old who called a cab late at night and was raped. It apparently didn't occur to the driver that the cab company had records and he'd committed a crime.\n\nBut also, a Muslim didn't realize or care that the laws are different here and burned his wife and child, considered property under Islam. The child died, the wife was burned over 90% of her body, yet survived and was put in Long term care. The perp was surprised to be arrested and imprisoned", "NTA.

I tried to reassure her that it was just a dog. After class, the teacher told me that where that student had come from, dogs were more likely to be used as a weapon, so the student had some pretty understandable trauma.\n\nOP, I suspect that your immigrant neighbors might have some similar trauma. I've never heard of a religion that was against dogs (unless you count being a crazy cat person as a religion...). They might simply have a deep seated fear of dogs. \n\nA gentle YTA.

Doggo is never close enough to jump or get at people but they would plaster themselves against the hall wall and grab their children like I had a knife and I got sick of apologizing for simply existing.

Or does it only bother you because they are immigrants or Muslim? It's totally normal for people from a culture where it isn't the norm to have pet dogs to be uncomfortable or weary of them. There's many reasons why someone might not be comfortable around dogs, religion only being one of them, and it's weird to me that that is your particular hang up. I'm speaking as a person who adores dogs, I have two large dogs myself, they are my best friends and it's hard for me to imagine how anyone could not love them but when I am out and about and someone is clearly uncomfortable or scared of my dogs I keep them at my side and let whoever it is pass. That's just common curtisy. I also live in a US city with one of the highest populations of Muslim people and refugees in the country but they definitely are not the only people who have been weary of my big dogs. I also have Muslim friends who love dogs and have them themselves. So I think your fixation on that is very weird and thinly veiled xenophobia.", "NTA but barely. As others have said, it's cultural not religious.

My neighbors were more hesitant, just because they hadn't been around dogs before, but after meeting my big cuddly golden retriever, they were fine around him (I did feel awful the time he went visiting their house when he got loose).
