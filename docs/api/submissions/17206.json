Why would you want your toddler playing where all those dogs go to the bathroom?", "NTA. The kid was in a spot for dogs and she got upset that a dog entered that area... maybe if she looked up off her phone for once she would notice this happening and be a normal human being and take her kid to the playground. You did everything right here though and didn't go off on her or make a scene like most people, including me, would have done haha you took the high road and played with your dog, so good on you!

When you bring your kid to a dog park, there will most likely be unleashed dogs. If the toddler got lost and his mom wasnt there its one thing but she let him be there. MAYBE you couldve given her a heads up that her kid is around an unleashed dog but honestly i cant really blame you for anything", "Holy fuck, NTA. You were in the fucking dog park!

We were on a rv roadtrip once, pulled into the rest area, grabbed the dog to do his thing.  There was a whole family 10 - 12 people picnicking , sitting on the ground  in this dog run area.

Two dogs just playing can bowl over a toddler without even noticing", "I see this stuff all the time where the parent is out for a walk with the kids and is stopped mid stride zonked out on their phone, dead to the world, and their kid for all they know is walking into traffic and they'd be standing there like a moron looking at a reply to their post about french toast or a stupid argument with a stranger on reddit", "This sounds like a horribly designed area.", "NTA, from my understanding most dog parks don't allow children in them.
