While I understand your dog deserves her fun time of the day, and I do think that the woman was completely in the wrong to take her child to a dog park, why risk hurting an innocent toddler when it's the mom who should pay the consequences for her decision? And no, I don't believe that her child getting hurt serves her right, the child is completely innocent and should not be put in any situation that could be harmful. If her/his mom is not in her right mind to avoid such situations, you should know better and be the bigger person. And just to make this clear, I am not saying dogs are always dangerous but there's always that small chance something could happen, maybe the dog slips away, gets a bit too exited to see a toddler and plays too rough. I am someone who always half-jokingly says \"I like animals more than people\" and \"I don't like children\" but I would never do what you did.
