Why would you want your toddler playing where all those dogs go to the bathroom?", "NTA. The kid was in a spot for dogs and she got upset that a dog entered that area... maybe if she looked up off her phone for once she would notice this happening and be a normal human being and take her kid to the playground. You did everything right here though and didn't go off on her or make a scene like most people, including me, would have done haha you took the high road and played with your dog, so good on you! She doesn't have to care about your dog and you don't have to care about her kid, that simple .", "NTA\n\nHer child was playing in a dog park - so she didn't have the right to say anything about a cute lil' pup in the park. Also, it's not like your dog went anywhere near the child.", "NTA - She was TA. It's a DOG park. She just wanted to be able to ignore her child and play on her phone.", "NTA\n\nEntitled parents are just the worst! Their little darling had their own space their unbearable mother can take them to for playing, doing it in one of few dog parks and then having the audacity to try to tell you off just shows what an odious woman she is.\n\nI pity her child.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a dog park, meaning she is in the wrong. \n\nShe was probably too lazy to get off her phone to supervise her child at the actual park meant for kids, so she put it in the dog park for ease.", "NTA, you were in a dog park.", "  NTA, \n\nIts is a dog park and the playground is literally next to it.", "NTA. When you bring your kid to a dog park, there will most likely be unleashed dogs. If the toddler got lost and his mom wasnt there its one thing but she let him be there. MAYBE you couldve given her a heads up that her kid is around an unleashed dog but honestly i cant really blame you for anything", "Holy fuck, NTA. You were in the fucking dog park! Jfc", "NTA - unless her kid is some kind of werewolf toddler then she gets to go to the playground for kids and dogs keep the dog park.", "NTA, it\u2019s a dog park. There\u2019s no reason a toddler should be playing there without a dog.", "NTA - your in one of the few spaces to let the dog play in the city", "Kids aren\u2019t even allowed in many dog parks. I cannot imagine letting my kid crawl around all of that pee and poo grossness. NTA", "The child is more important than the dog? Yes, correct. So you, CARETAKER OF THE CHILD, should not turn the child loose in an area that is designated for unleashed dogs. Take care of you kid, idiot.\n\nPlayground, there, go!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThat Designated space was carved out for dogs. There was a designated space RIGHT NEXT TO IT carved out for children. That woman knew it was a dog park. You shouldn\u2019t have to give up your right to a SHARED DESIGNATED SPACE just because someone else is using it wrong.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAs a mom myself, this thought process is bizarre.", "NTA\n\nYou were in the dog park.  you were training you dog, paying attention to your dog.\n\nShe was ignoring the toddler.  If she had been a decent minder she should have redirected the toddler to the playground area and not the dog park area.\n\nNot sure how it could be done, but maybe the city needs to put a fence between the two areas?", "NTA.  We were on a rv roadtrip once, pulled into the rest area, grabbed the dog to do his thing.  There was a whole family 10 - 12 people picnicking , sitting on the ground  in this dog run area. They were very upset with us letting our dog do his business around them.  We pointed at the dog on the leash sign right in front of them. How they never noticed the dog sh#t all over , I will never know. Clean up after your pets people.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
