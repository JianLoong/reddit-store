I expressed this to Tom but he says Aspen is still young and needs to be taken care of. \n\nLast night I was going over to Tom\u2019s he told me the front door is unlocked so just walk in. Well, I walked in to find Aspen laying on Tom\u2019s lap asleep. I asked Tom if he thinks Aspen is a little too old to be doing this. He said no especially considering she\u2019s sick. I said I think she is too old and it needs to stop. He told me I\u2019m being an AH and I need to stop being weird about something completely normal.

If he's being inappropriate, then he thought you were the type to be fine with it as he just invited you right in without moving. What you mean by him babying her is that he cares for and loves his own daughter. How scandalous. She's barely turned into a teenager, is middle school aged, and you're acting like he needs to now treat her like she's 20.\n\nIf you don't want a boyfriend who spends time parenting, loving, and caring for a child, then you need to do everyone a favor, including yourself, and find a childless boyfriend.

Daughters aren\u2019t allowed close relationships with their fathers as teenagers? Whatever BS you are using to justify this nonsense is likely just toxic thoughts.", "YTA. There's no age at which people need less physical contact. As long as his daughter respects your boundaries and doesn't get between him and you on purpose by climbing on his lap there's really no problem. Daughters with good parental support are less likely to date at an early age, less likely to have psychological problems.

That stuff belongs in the 1880s.", "YTA. \nMy daughter is 19 and sometimes will still come to me for comfort and fall asleep on my lap. \nDon\u2019t take that away from them.", "YTA, but I'm going to try to be kind here. Every family has a level of affection they are comfortable with. Also, many countries sexualize physical affection and it's hard to go against what you've been raised with. I think that's probably what you're doing, or you're saying that children over a certain age shouldn't receive physical affection because they need to be tough, or both. The issue is, you don't get to project your discomfort on the relationship your boyfriend has with his daughter. You just don't, it's just not your place. Repeat, NOT YOUR PLACE. At all. If it continues to make you uncomfortable, then the onus is upon you to work through your own issues.\n\nFor what is worth, I have three teenage boys that have a different level of comfort with physical affection. I have a complicated past personally with in family physical affection so I really tried to be open and take their lead. My oldest son hugs me and kisses me on the lips. My middle son might give me a hug once a month. My youngest son would definitely put his head on my lap and let me rub it if he was sick, but he doesn't give me much other physical affection beyond that (all three constantly tell me they love me). But that's between me and them.", "YTA  It's his *child.* She will always be his child, no matter how old she gets. It sounds like you need to date someone without kids if this is your overall attitude. What's next, will you be advocating for kicking her out of the house the day she turns 18?", "Yta\n\nI pity you... recieving affection from one's parents is not wrong. There's no age limit to be cuddling with dad/mom. There's nothing sexual in it.", "YTA.   Her father is giving her the emotional love and support that teenaged girls often crave from men.  If she can get that from her father, she is more likely to have healthy relationships.   There is absolutely no reason for him to stop holding his daughter when she needs it, whether she's 13 or 35.     \n\n\nI do strongly encourage you to have him ask here about the same situation.   Your attitude is toxic for a teenager and needs to be corrected or gotten out of her life as soon as possible.", "YTA.  STOP sexualizing young girls!\nAnd work on your self esteem.  Jealousy is about your fragile ego not your boyfriend", "YTA - not your child, so leave their relationship alone.", "YTA.

A day will come when the daughter is extremely embarrassed by her dad no matter what.", "YTA. This is Tom's child, not yours. If Tom's daughter is sick and he's tending to her, that's a good thing.

You never, EVVVVVER, tell your partner how they're allowed to show affection to their child. 13 is not too old to sit on your father's lap. I wish to fucking God I could sit on my Dad's lap today, as a grown ass woman. He loves his child. He is man enough to care for her when she's sick. He knows she's hurting and it makes her feel better just to know that she's loved. And you want to stop that?! Wtf??", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to find it weird.

Why are you making this weird?", "YTA.  don't get in between a parent and their own child.  showing a child comfort and nurturing them when they're sick or otherwise when they need it, can only be beneficial.  she is still young and obviously needs comfort from her dad.  i think if anything, you should be grateful that a man is not afraid to show affection and his nurturing side.", "YTA.  My grown adult kids can snuggle right next to me if they want. This is normal for many families and not weird or creepy.

I\u2019m 20 years old. I still sometimes sit on my moms lap if there isn\u2019t a place to sit and wait like at a restaurant. Why are you making her sitting on his lap sexual?

I expressed this to Tom but he says Aspen is still young and needs to be taken care of. \n\nLast night I was going over to Tom\u2019s he told me the front door is unlocked so just walk in. Well, I walked in to find Aspen laying on Tom\u2019s lap asleep. I asked Tom if he thinks Aspen is a little too old to be doing this. He said no especially considering she\u2019s sick. I said I think she is too old and it needs to stop. He told me I\u2019m being an AH and I need to stop being weird about something completely normal.

Fingers crossed!", "Good point.", "I guess I was assuming, why else would she feel so uncomfortable with the daughter on the father's lap?", "...Why are you going through the thread and just repeating this?", "The saying she's too old because she's a teenager *is* the sexualization.", "saying she is too old is sexualising it", "Are you OP on an alt or something?", "You've made this comment several times. I'll hear you out.  If it's not sexualization....what other reason would the OP feel it's inappropriate?", "That\u2019s sweet how your mom lets you work on that online psychology degree from her basement. \nPay attention to the last sentence in my comment.", "I\u2019m sorry your stepmom was mean to you.", "Exactly, she sees the daughter as competition.", "Omg. I had this exact situation w an ex and his mom. I swear she thought I was a threat bc I was dating her son or something.", "Before immediately calling OP out for a toxic mindset, can we at least consider the possibility of her being abused in her past life and this influencing her view on age related situations? The child is getting too old for physical affection sounds like a sexual accusation to me.\n\nEdit: Wanted to quickly clarify. OP is still dead wrong and is very much TA, I'm just saying that sometimes toxicity is sprouted from bad childhoods. She could be relating two completely irrelevant situations because her definition of things are confused.", "Wild speculation. \n\nIt could simply be her parents enforced affection boundaries at a young age with her.  Or cut off affection after a certain age.", "This thought occurred to me as well. People who have been victims of abuse, or seen it up close and personal will sometimes set boundaries WAY out where the rest of us think they are being unreasonable. No reason to assert this is what happened, but it does make you wonder.", "I cuddled up next to my dad when I was upset til the day he died.  I was 28.\n\nMy mom had called that \"fucking disgusting\" one time when I was 18, and I STILL think about that.", "And the girl is SICK, for goodness' sake. OP is just mean.", "This made me laugh so hard", "You're not wrong. No wonder England wouldn't have those Puritans stinking up the place anymore.", "What the hell, when did OP even say they were American?  Literally everyone I know would be calling her the asshole (and also everyone in her own life is).  I get this site has an anti-American hard on but Jesus.", "My 5'10\", 200 lb son would sit on my (5'4\", 160 lb) lap when he came home from college. My 18 yr old daughter will sit on her dad's lap, or on mine, after dinner for a quick cuddle.", "I mean this sub is used for lots of asinine things that posters themselves don\u2019t think are a big deal. They\u2019re just curious about what the right or wrong answer is.", "Hang on... they do??! \ud83d\ude02\n\nUhm... #AskingForaFriend \ud83d\ude06", "To be fair, it could also just be simple jealousy. OP wanting less affection going to the daughter so she can have that energy instead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGranted, by the way she types it does seem that she's sexualizing things, more than likely. But there is a very reasonable explanation for her whining about it while not sexualizing it.", "Your lack on insight doesn\u2019t change how crazy you sound.", "Since you bring the words \"online psychology degree\" into this I assume you have a real psychology degree and can mabye link to any credible peer review source that actually proves this is a real thing and not just something the evil stepmom from Cinderella came up with.\n\nAnd why is it a problem to hold ones parents hand. Or cuddle. You can show love to family members without it being sexual", "You're weird", "I'm sorry you're a mean stepmom.", "Don't have a stepmom.", "Gross", "It's not that wild. It absolutely is speculation though.  Many victims are made extremely uncomfortable by physical contact. \nYour speculation also makes sense too", "Someone else just pointed out that maybe it's even the opposite of this, and she grew up in a household with very strict boundaries and little affection.", "I\u2019m 30 and still snuggle with both parents and we aren\u2019t even the most lovey dovey family. But they\u2019re my parents\u2026", "nah i'm american and they're right", "My 17yo still wants to be cuddled after a night terror and will lay her head on my lap and have me play with her hair. We never outgrow wanting our parents love", "Sure.  \n\nNow, what's more common, families with weird boundaries, or victims of child sexual assault?", "Given the statistics on prevalence of CSA (20% of girls and 5-10% of boys) I suspect it's probably a toss up.", "That's impossible to assess. The tragic answer is that both are extremely common. In THIS case, the speculation about either could provide helpful insight for OP, in case one or the other resonates. No cause for scornful debate here, IMO.", "Worldwide up to 31% of girls and up to 17% of boys experience CSA. So, uh\u2026 those numbers might not look as different as you\u2019re trying to be condescending about, champ. Families that pathologically cut off normal physical affection to their children before they\u2019ve even really started adolescence are really not that common, and bluntly, families like that are much more likely to also be ones in which the child is being abused in other ways.", "I don't have the data to correctly answer that.  But are you a man? I'm only asking because I think women  are more acutely aware that the majority of girls have experienced inappropriate sexual behaviors directed towards them at least once by the age of 14. Not necessarily assault, but comments, flashing, etc.", "Also that's only what's reported right?", "No, report rates are much lower. The statistics are based on interviews with adults and teens.\n\nhttps://victimsofcrime.org/child-sexual-abuse-statistics/\n\nThis gives a breakdown and lists some bigger studies in this area.", "Thank you for the data!"]}
