I think it\u2019s fine to baby your kid(s) but Aspen is a teenager and doesn\u2019t need to be babied anymore. I expressed this to Tom but he says Aspen is still young and needs to be taken care of. \n\nLast night I was going over to Tom\u2019s he told me the front door is unlocked so just walk in. Well, I walked in to find Aspen laying on Tom\u2019s lap asleep. I asked Tom if he thinks Aspen is a little too old to be doing this. He said no especially considering she\u2019s sick. I said I think she is too old and it needs to stop. He told me I\u2019m being an AH and I need to stop being weird about something completely normal.

If he's being inappropriate, then he thought you were the type to be fine with it as he just invited you right in without moving.

Daughters aren\u2019t allowed close relationships with their fathers as teenagers? Whatever BS you are using to justify this nonsense is likely just toxic thoughts.", "YTA. There's no age at which people need less physical contact. As long as his daughter respects your boundaries and doesn't get between him and you on purpose by climbing on his lap there's really no problem. Daughters with good parental support are less likely to date at an early age, less likely to have psychological problems.

Every family has a level of affection they are comfortable with. Also, many countries sexualize physical affection and it's hard to go against what you've been raised with. I think that's probably what you're doing, or you're saying that children over a certain age shouldn't receive physical affection because they need to be tough, or both. The issue is, you don't get to project your discomfort on the relationship your boyfriend has with his daughter. You just don't, it's just not your place. Repeat, NOT YOUR PLACE. At all. If it continues to make you uncomfortable, then the onus is upon you to work through your own issues.\n\nFor what is worth, I have three teenage boys that have a different level of comfort with physical affection. I have a complicated past personally with in family physical affection so I really tried to be open and take their lead. My oldest son hugs me and kisses me on the lips. My middle son might give me a hug once a month. My youngest son would definitely put his head on my lap and let me rub it if he was sick, but he doesn't give me much other physical affection beyond that (all three constantly tell me they love me). But that's between me and them.", "YTA  It's his *child.* She will always be his child, no matter how old she gets.

There's no age limit to be cuddling with dad/mom. There's nothing sexual in it.", "YTA.   Her father is giving her the emotional love and support that teenaged girls often crave from men.  If she can get that from her father, she is more likely to have healthy relationships.   There is absolutely no reason for him to stop holding his daughter when she needs it, whether she's 13 or 35.     \n\n\nI do strongly encourage you to have him ask here about the same situation.   Your attitude is toxic for a teenager and needs to be corrected or gotten out of her life as soon as possible.", "YTA.  STOP sexualizing young girls!\nAnd work on your self esteem.  Jealousy is about your fragile ego not your boyfriend", "YTA - not your child, so leave their relationship alone.", "YTA.

You never, EVVVVVER, tell your partner how they're allowed to show affection to their child. 13 is not too old to sit on your father's lap.

He knows she's hurting and it makes her feel better just to know that she's loved. And you want to stop that?! Wtf??", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to find it weird.

Why are you making this weird?", "YTA.  don't get in between a parent and their own child.  showing a child comfort and nurturing them when they're sick or otherwise when they need it, can only be beneficial.  she is still young and obviously needs comfort from her dad.  i think if anything, you should be grateful that a man is not afraid to show affection and his nurturing side.", "YTA.  My grown adult kids can snuggle right next to me if they want. This is normal for many families and not weird or creepy.

My dad and I were super close when I was little; he was the only parent I got hugs from and cuddled with, but that faded by the time I was 8 or so and I missed it.

I'm still generally more comfortable around men than other women.", "When I was with my ex, my heart would melt when he was cuddling his son.

It's a pretty silly show but that part (and the genuine pain and trauma Penny expresses from the sudden rejection) is quite real. The sudden switch from \"you're a little girl I'm comfortable being close to\" to the unintentional sexualization of \"you're a young woman so I must keep you always at arm length no matter how much you need comfort and support\" is experienced by many girls/AFAB people and it can really mess people up. \n\nYTA, OP, and you need to unpack your misogynistic hangups, not project them onto a loving, healthy, supportive father/daughter relationship. That's the thing that \"needs to stop.\" Not your boyfriend's good parenting and refreshingly nontoxic masculinity.", "Oh my gosh. So true! \nI (36) still give my dad hugs and kisses. And I LOVE seeing my husband pouring affection on my daughter (and son)   I can\u2019t imagine being so insecure that I\u2019d try preventing a father from showing affection to his own child.", "Same. I'm 31 years old and I will absolutely lean over on my parents or other relatives because we're close and have good relationships. OP is trying to take something completely normal and make it weird.", "This hits every important nail right on the head. \n\nAs a parent to a very affectionate kid, I\u2019ll gladly show physical affection towards her forever; as long as she\u2019s down I am always there. I thought growing up being shown little to none and being raised by a mother who never told me she loved me would have tarnished my ability to show physical affection. But through my daughter I\u2019ve found that part of myself I was never able to nurture before. I have so much to thank her for, but that\u2019s just one example. People who don\u2019t have children couldn\u2019t ever understand. I\u2019ve met people who don\u2019t like kids that don\u2019t agree with parents kissing their kids, either. (And that\u2019s not an exaggeration). Folks like that make situations like this inappropriate and weird, when they never were and it never had to be viewed that way. \n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve noticed, like you mentioned, is way too many people telling me stories of their fathers new girlfriends/wives seeing them as competition. So there is hostility and jealousy and the woman constantly trying to drive a wedge between the parent and child. And far, far too many times have I seen fathers allow it. \u201cScrew kids from the first marriage, time for family number  2, and second wife is uncomfortable with the reminder of my life before her so I\u2019ll just do the bare minimum while we start our lives together with as little interruption from family number 1 as possible.\u201d My ex\u2019s dad did this and it was awful hearing stories about his step mom and how normalized it was in his eyes, just excusing his fathers \u201cdated\u201d beliefs of \u201chappy wife happy life.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t mean sacrificing your kids!\n\nHonestly good on OP\u2019s man for choosing his kid and standing his ground, protecting his relationship with his daughter. Obviously men do this to women as well (my mom did this), but I am always far more impressed when men put their foot down and stand up for their kids and their relationships with them because I\u2019ve heard so many more stories of fathers being the ones to dip out for the sake of a romantic relationship.", "Exactly this. Because the same people who say things like the OP is in her post *also* complain that men aren\u2019t emotionally present enough parents as a *rule* while enforcing the very same expectation they\u2019re complaining about.", "I think that years of seeing pictures of Trump with and hearing him talk about Ivanka as a pre-teen and teen has tainted all of our mental pictures of fathers with daughters.", "Yep, that\u2019s what I had thought as well!

Daughter is the priority, end of story.", "I have felt that way. I was 21 and he was much older with 2 kids. I very quickly realised I was not mature enough to be in that kind of relationship and bowed out for the benefit of everyone involved. Now that I have my own daughter I see everything so differently and would never let anyone make me choose between them and her or expect any other parent to make that choice. My biggest fear is something happening to me and her ending up with someone like OP in her life trying to block her from her father's love and affection.", "I suspect it's more that she's concerned that other people will think bad things and maybe she does too but my children say on my lap until they were too big to do so and then they still laid their heads on my lap and if they still needed to (33M, 28M, 22M) I'd let them. \n\nOP YTA", "My cat and my wife have a similar dynamic.

It's just sexist that this father is being judged.", "Thats horribly dumb logic, lets assume this person was tragically abused as a child to justify their shitty personality", "I agree. To me it sounds more like she thinks it's inappropriate rather than her being jealous. It could also be a combination of both. \n\nIt's not exactly uncommon though. There are a lot of people, especially with those who aren't parents imo, that just see a teenage girl on a man's lap. It doesn't even have to be something they think is inappropriate. Some people just can't fathom what it's like being a parent and look at things very differently. I used to do it myself, not to this extent but there were some things that I judged differently when I was childless.

Physical affection does make me uncomfortable however I am aware of why it makes me uncomfortable. If my kids need a hug they get one, I tell them multiple times a day that I love them and yes sometimes when they need to talk they will sit on my or my husbands lap to talk through things.
