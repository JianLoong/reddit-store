I have now graduated and completed my first year of college, but I\u2019m home for the summer and have been spending some time with my high school friends.\n\nAutumn is autistic and has trouble understanding social norms. They will sometimes \u201cheadcannon\u201d people as a specific gender identity or sexual orientation and in a relationship with another person that they know. It makes a lot of people really uncomfortable, but Autumn doesn\u2019t understand why despite this being explained to them gently multiple times. Autumn and I were never close, but they \u201cheadcannoned\u201d me as pansexual and in a relationship with them, and I couldn\u2019t quite explain to them why I didn\u2019t like that.\n\nI met up for lunch with a high school friend yesterday and she asked me if I was really dating Autumn. She is not friends with Autumn or in their social circle in any way, so I was super confused as to why she thought that, especially since I have a boyfriend and would never date a high school sophomore as a college student. Apparently, Autumn has been telling people that we are in a relationship. I was absolutely mortified and said no, I wasn\u2019t, and then told her about all the \u201cheadcannoning\u201d. She was equally mortified and told our friends, and I guess word got out to pretty much the rest of the school.\n\nAutumn\u2019s mother reached out to me via social media DMs today to tell me that she understands the dating thing was uncomfortable, but my \u201crumors\u201d about their child have been spreading around the school, and that they\u2019re devastated because nobody wants to talk to them anymore because they think they\u2019re \u201ccreepy\u201d. I told her that I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s impacting their social life, but that it\u2019s not a rumor since they really did everything I told my friend about. She said that Autumn didn\u2019t understand that it was wrong and I\u2019m already gone from the school, so I could have just said that we weren\u2019t dating and left it at that since the headcannoning part wasn\u2019t affecting me anymore anyway, so I really just needlessly ruined their social life for something they can\u2019t help. I honestly don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, but I want to get some other opinions.

It doesn\u2019t matter if she can\u2019t control it. She\u2019s still doing it and it\u2019s impacting you and who knows else. You told the truth and are not in the wrong here. Her parents should have taught her better and done more to control her actions.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a rumor if it\u2019s the truth. IMO it\u2019s borderline stalker behavior and just downright creepy. Their mom is enabling this behavior, and sooner or later Autumn is going to face worse consequences than you simply setting the record straight.", "NTA.  I think the mom is lashing out at you because her anger/frustration will be validated more by your reaction than if she directed it at Autumn. I feel for her, but she's very unreasonable expecting you to go along with an uncomfortable situation when you didn't even know their \"headcannon\" had spread around to people they weren't even friends with.", "Absolutely NTA. I'm also autistic, and am very vocal about everyone's individual experiences with autism are unique, but what Autumn is doing is **100% not okay**. \"Headcanons\" are for fictional characters and universes, not reality! Additionally, YOU were the person they was telling everyone they were in a relationship with, which was **a total lie**! You didn't do anything other than clarify that you're not dating this person. Personally, I think it's the responsibility of their family and friends to be much firmer in making them understand why this is unacceptable behavior. Autism is not an excuse for acting this way. OP, I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this. Hoping that this nonsense can leave you alone soon!", "NTA and this isn\u2019t an autism trait. Yes, autistic folk often have a very active imagination which would creep people out if they could peer inward, most of us learn when we\u2019re young to restrain that. Ignoring people\u2019s obvious discomfort is something else, so you don\u2019t need to feel like an ableist asshole for this.", "NTA\n\nYou were hurt by a lie. You corrected the lie publicly. And there is nothing wrong with that.", "NTA.   This was on their\\* mother to fix, not you.   It has been explained to them numerous times, and they refuse to listen.  I know there are more complications to Autism than I can possibly know,  but that doesn't mean they doesn't have consequences for their actions, spectrum or not.\n\nEdit bc I missed the non binary", "NTA. It's not a rumor if you tell the truth. It was not OK for Autumn to tell people you were dating, and you absolutely have the right to correct people who think that, and that certainly involve's Autumn's weird trait.\n\nI know her mom would like to sweep all of this under the rug, but she needs to deal with this NOW.  Autumn needs to learn that this is not OK.", "I was prepared to call you T A based on the title but after reading NTA, shipping people IRL and making up their sexualities is very creepy. Autism isn't an excuse to be a creep to someone like that. Especially when you're not dating them, all you did was tell the truth.", "Sorry, what the heck is headcanoning? \n\nI tried looking it up and am only finding references to canon of movies. As in, filling in blanks of a canon with your own interpretation.", "It depends on how hard you pushed things, but I would say NTA.  It sounds like her mom needs to get her some social skills training and support.  It is unfortunate that her social life (which likely already was hard) is now impacted so harshly, but it does sound like she repeatedly took ideas and went with them despite being corrected and really needed supports that high schoolers aren't capable of giving her.", "That\u2019s not an autism thing. That\u2019s just being weird and disrespectful to people. You are not the asshole. \n\nI know autism is a spectrum and our experiences of it are different, and I know that taking in new information that contradicts existing info in my head is a challenge sometimes, but what\u2019s going on with this person is not something to be accommodated.", "NTA. Autism doesn't give someone a pass to be rude, creepy, an asshole, etc., This is a lesson for them that they can't just do whatever they want. There are consequences to their actions. If they didn't know that it was wrong to do that before, they definitely do now.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s super gross that Autumn is making people think OP is dating them. OP has an explanation for why it is not the case and also why Autumn says it. \n\nIt\u2019s not gossip to clarify your relationship status. It\u2019s not your fault other people find their trait of doing this weird.", "I would also mention the issue of a legal adult \"dating\" a minor.  That could end badly for you if the rumor was taken seriously. You need to protect yourself, very much NTA.", "NTA. Autism (any diagnosis really) is an explanation, NEVER an excuse. \n\nWhat Autumn is doing is not acceptable and it is a huge failing from their mother that they aren\u2019t taking this more seriously. \u201cHeadcannon\u201d is a FANTASY meant to be applied to fictional characters and stories, NOT real people! Not only was Autumn imposing their own fantasy of your sexuality (not okay), they were also telling folks you\u2019re in a relationship with a literal minor. That\u2019s dangerous and could have some serious negative repercussions!", "NTA, Autumn brought this on herself. You did nothing but inform a friend that no you werent dating them, never were and never would.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit because I can't spell this morning", "NTA. Autistic adult here. This is really on Autumn\u2019s mum for not getting control of this habit. This \u2018headcannoning\u2019 could be really harmful- what if they said a couple were cheating? Or someone had a secret baby? Or someone was a different sexual orientation or gender, and their family had a bad reaction to that? \n\nThey likely don\u2019t understand the full implications of her actions, and that\u2019s why the adults in her life need to help them divert this tendency into something healthier. What happened to good old \u2018shipping\u2019 of relationships of characters in fictional series?!\n\nAutumn\u2019s mum is not doing them any favours by trying to brush it away instead of tackling it. This sort of thing really won\u2019t go well when they\u2019re an adult in the workplace or university.", "NTA. So let me get this straight.  Autumn fantasies about shipping different people together.  Autumn creates a fantasy about about dating and being in a relationship with OP.  Op finds out about the lies Autumn has been telling everyone and sets things straight by saying it's not true.  Now everyone at Autumn's school know they lied and people find that creepy.  So Autumn's mum is angry at Op for setting things straight. I think Autumn's mum needs to teach their child better and to stop lying about stuff.  This is just so strange.", "NTA, they were spreading rumors about you, all you did was try to correct it. Being autistic explains why they wouldn\u2019t understand why something makes people uncomfortable, but it is not an excuse to keep doing it after people ask them to stop.", "Admittedly I had to Google \u201cheadcannoning,\u201d but no, just no.\n\nAutumn\u2019s mother is 100% wrong when she dismisses extremely disturbing behavior as something that can\u2019t be helped and not a problem for you.\n\nWhether or not Autumn truly believes that you\u2019re in a relationship with them, Autumn needs psychological help, specifically the kind that Autumn\u2019s parents can and should provide for their child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You just don't understand how hard it is to be autistic sometimes. You definitely should have handled it differently though.", "YTA - Autumn's mom is correct.  You should have simply said no, it wasn't correct and that because of Autumn's autism, they sometimes get confused or make up stories.  You didn't have to gossip any further than that.  Instead because you were \"mortified\" at the very thought of people thinking you were in a relationship with Autumn, you went out of your way to destroy their credibility.  Autumn may not be able to control their actions, you can control yours.  Shame on you for being a mean girl and being purposefully cruel.... and for making up words like \"headcannoning\".", "NTA. You weren't gossiping; rather you were responding to gossip about you.\n\nIt sounds like your friend from high school was gossiping though and may be the AH.", "Regardless of any mental status or gender - if people hear a true fact about you and think it's creepy, you don't get to be upset they think you are creepy.  If you don't want people to think you are creepy then stop doing the creepy thing.  \n\nIf they are high functioning enough to attend public high school then they understands that when someone says 'hey, please stop doing this' exactly what they should stop doing.  \n\nTelling people you are dating someone you are not dating is a huge violation.  Big enough that other people should be warned that it wasn't a miscommunication and it could happen again.  Plus you should never have to protect the feelings of someone who is lying about dating you.", "\\*Them", "Once again, someone who doesn't understand autism.", "[deleted]", "Tl;dr \u201cHeadcannoning\u201d is fandom lingo where fans of a story or media will make up a plot point and consider it factually true unless the story directly contradicts that plot points existence, some people will still continue to insist the made up plot point is true even in the face of contradiction.\n\nFor example, back in the day people used to \u201chead cannon\u201d Markiplier and Jacksepticeye as a gay couple and created loads on NSFW content. It got so bad they rarely if ever do collaborations together because it wouldn\u2019t stop and they were both creeped out by it.", "Pretty much but the in this aspect autum is \"shipping\" (look up fan fic lingo I promise it'll help) herself and OP. So basically what she's doing is if she were rewriting reality, which she is in her head, she's writing herself and OP as a relationship. That's the best way I can describe it.", "That's pretty much it (or pairing characters together that arent actually together in the source material) but it sounds like this girl is doing it in real life, to real people with real consequences instead of to fictional characters", "Basically the autistic person in this scenario, was trying to make sense of the situation by doing exactly what you described. They didn't understand what was going on, so just tried to make sense of things.", "Yes, that's what it is-- it's like deciding something that isn't contradicted by the story, but also isn't stated by the story, is your personal canon of what happened. But it's supposed to be about *fiction*\\-- movies, books, tv shows, whatever. Not real people and especially not real people you actually *know*. And you also wouldn't go around saying your headcanon is true, even in the context of fiction. Like if I thought it would make sense if Character A and Character B were dating but it was never shown onscreen, I wouldn't go around describing the movie like \"and Characters A and B are together.\" So what Autumn is doing has essentially the same impact as lying, even if they aren't deliberately being untruthful.", "I would be mortified if I were in college and people thought I was involved with a minor who did not understand how relationships work or have the ability to tell fantasy from reality. \n\nMost people would assume OP is taking advantage of Autumn.", "Autumn\u2019s behavior is causing real harm to other people. It is unfortunate that they are not supervised adequately by the adults in their life to prevent the situation from occurring in the first place but that doesn\u2019t mean that their autism or other developmental disabilities gives them a pass.\n\nAlso \u201cheadcanon\u201d is not a word OP made up, it\u2019s commonly used in fandom circles.", "Autism isn\u2019t a get out of jail free card and doesn\u2019t create a situation where everyone else needs to just eat it. It isn\u2019t about understanding autism or not, it\u2019s about those hurt being allowed to correct the hurt - in this case, openly saying what she said was not true and was a fabrication.", "I'm autistic. \n\nNot understanding nuance in social situations is pretty normal but the people here explicitly said to Autumn that they didn't like this and don't want them doing it any more. At that point its not a misunderstanding, it's Autumn choosing to do something they knows others don't like. \n\nIf their autism is comorbid with an intellectual disability, the parents need to be more involved and explain to Autumn the difference between pretend and reality before they get into a dangerous situation. \n\nIn the world we live in, 'uncomfortable' isn't the only reaction that someone can have to being told that you headcannon them as pansexual and in a queer relationship. Violence is also very common.", "Only autistic people seem to understand autism. \n\nAutumn\u2019s actions aren\u2019t an autism trait, and autistic people are capable of self restraint. There are some things that are harder to control but spinning elaborate narratives and expressing them about people isn\u2019t one of them.", "It's still not an excuse in any way shape or form.", "Yes, but your experience being autistic can be wildly different from someone else's. Especially if they have a more severe case.", "That's not even the case. Only the person with the condition know how their world works. Autism isn't just one size fits all, some have more severe cases than others, as I'm sure you're aware. This Autumn person sounds like they have a pretty severe case, having to \"headcannon\" for things to make sense. Most of the people in here are attributing malicious intent behind something that very well might be just a result of some lonely person with autism trying to make sense of a very complicated modern social boundaries. I could also be wrong, and it could just be down to the person being slightly unhinged.\n\nIs it kinda weird? Yeah for sure, I didn't say that OP was TA. I said NTA, but should have handled it differently. It can be incredibly lonely being autistic at school, I know from experience, and now this kid is going to be even more isolated. It's just a shit situation all around.", "It\u2019s autistic people responding (including me) to say this is not how autistic people deal with these difficulties.\n\nYes, lots of autistic behaviors get the creep label, but it\u2019s usually stuff like remembering things people told us that they forgot, or info dumping about a special interest which gets the obsessive label, or not getting over a seemingly minor conflict and ruminating for months or years after the fact. All elements from my life. None of that is me deliberately ignoring stated boundaries, that would be ignoring boundaries, not an autistic trait, though autistic people are capable of being belligerent assholes. \n\nYes, autism is a spectrum and manifests differently in everyone, but there are general patterns. Autumn\u2019s behavior does not fit any of the patterns."]}
