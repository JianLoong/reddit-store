That doesn't (at all) mean \"sit alone while I'm somewhere else having a better time than you\" is a good birthday gift.

Don\u2019t do that. Talk to her and get her to understand your perspective. Then do more drastic things if she didn\u2019t. It seems like she doesn\u2019t understand where she went wrong.

It's uncomfortable. I'd feel like an afterthought. \n\nOn the flipside, if I bought my significant other an expensive gift for his birthday that I was sure he would love, and he reacted negatively to it, I'd be put out. \n\nI don't think either of you are AH.

Most people like to feel like they\u2019re best friends with their partners. And it can make you feel insecure or hurt if/when it seems like they prioritize a \u201cregular\u201d friend over you. However, when the friend and your partner are the same gender (and their gender is different than yours), it much easier to avoid making comparisons. You can tell yourself that it\u2019s a different type of relationship and you are still the closest \u201cmale\u201d in your partners life. When your partner\u2019s friend is the same gender as you, however, it\u2019s much harder not to make the comparison. So, I get it. Your feelings are valid. You\u2019re allowed to be hurt.", "NTA.

Sometimes I\u2019ve had to do this at soccer matches with my two lads, but they get to sit together and I sit elsewhere. They love it, having independence time together. Completely different to your scenario. \n\nI think you can both get over this easily though. She made a mistake. Surprise gifts are always a risk, so it may be best to agree to always discuss things like this first.", "NTA. You were an afterthought at best.

Naturally, the seats beside them were no longer available. \n\nA theatrical production is not the same as a dinner. You should not be talking during the performance anyway, and you can meet up during intermission and go out together after.

It had nothing to do with you. It was an event arranged between her and her friend.

You are acting like an unappreciative dick. Yes, ideally you'd be next to them but we can't alter reality to our choosing.\n\nYou are being unreasonably jealous here.", "I think you're wrong.  The tickets were bought before you were even in the picture.  Presumably the gay friend was paying her back for his ticket, or else they had a reciprocal arrangement where they'd alternate paying for theatre trips.  Maybe it was his birthday, too.\n\nYou came along.  She told you about the tickets, explained the situation to you.  You were disappointed that... what, that she hadn't bought two tickets in advance fantasizing that she'd meet a mysterious someone who would want to go with her?  Nope.  She bought the tickets for herself and her friend.\n\nShe refused to bump her friend.  But she was kind enough to get you a ticket to the same performance.  Instead of being grateful for the consideration, you sulked.  Were you anticipating chatting throughout the performance?  You could have rendezvoused at the bar during the interval, gone for a meal together before or after the show.  Instead, you made it a Big Deal.\n\nWould it have been better if she had not taken the trouble to obtain a ticket for you at all?\n\nYou are definitely being silly about her having a guy friend to go to the theatre with.  Their relationship is of longer standing than yours, but, well, she was with you, wasn't she?  Frankly, I don't understand your POV either.  You seem to have acted childishly.  And you're still blaming her for not considering your point of view.\n\nYes, YTA.", "NTA - sometimes things just aren't meant to be", "YTA. These tickets were bought before you were in the picture. It sounds like you let your emotions show easily. You were disappointed when she told you about the tickets and I am sure it was obvious. So, she tries to be courteous and buy a ticket for you to the same play. Of course they could not be beside each other, she bought the other tickets way before she knew you. She (naively) thought this would make you happy. Of course, no one wants to sit alone in a theatre on their birthday, but she had previous commitments. Why are you TA? Because you admitted that the only reason you are upset is because the friend is a guy. There is an insecurity there and you are pushing it on her. Remember, 8 months is not marriage. This incident may cause her to rethink her relationship with you.", "Soft YTA. What did you expect her to do? Her ticket is hers, her friend's is not so the only thing she can decide to do is to give you her ticket and you'll sit with him. Does that sound any better ?? She can't and should absolutely not try to have her friend give you his ticket, they bought them before you came along. The only other option would have been not to buy you a ticket at all and you'd have missed out completely. Honestly the situation sucks but you did react rather immaturely for a 40yr old. You'll see them before and after but if it really feels bad then tell her you won't come and that you want the 2 of you to do something together at some other point.", "YTA - this was pre-arranged before you were even in the picture. Your explanation about the dinner doesn\u2019t hold any water as it\u2019s not the same situation at all. The theatre is a place you go to watch and be quiet, not sit and chat like you do in a restaurant. Nothing stopping you all going out before or after, or catching up at interval. \n\nYou say you love this particular director, and clearly the show was on sale way before you and your GF met so there was nothing stopping you from getting tickets. It was nice of her to get you a ticket for your birthday. \n\nYour POV is immature and you\u2019re quite clearly jealous. I think your reaction would have been the same even if it wasn\u2019t your birthday.", "YTA. She bought those tickets for her friend *before she even met you*. That ticket was already his. She bought your ticket later, when seats in the front would have been either unavailable or unreasonably expensive. I get that it kinda sucks, but you're blowing this WAY out of proportion. If it was your only birthday present I can see that not being the best, but as long as she got you other stuff then you're just throwing a hissyfit because she's keeping the commitments she's made.", "NTA, getting you a ticket for your birthday to sit on your own is a terrible idea. She could have gone another day with you, or just left it and done something else for your birthday. \n\nBut a \u2018we\u2019ll sit here and you have a seat in the back on your own\u2019 is not very nice. It\u2019s not about her and the friend going, it\u2019s about her birthday present to you being tickets on your own in the back. \n\nYTA for being bothered that she is going with a man. They had tickets, great good for them. You shouldn\u2019t be jealous or feel like she picked him, she\u2019s allowed to have friends and go to things without you.

She didn't know you when she bought the tickets.", "[deleted]", "YTA. They bought the tickets even before you started dating. She had only 1 ticket, 2nd ticker is her friend's. But since you shown interest too,  she bought you 3rd one. Obviously, if play is popular, it is safe to assume that the best tickets were sold out. So. Now you want her friend to give you his ticket? He has no obligation to do so for you. Or you want her to give you her ticket, so you would be sitting there with her friend?", "YTA. Was it tacky for her to get you a lesser ticket? Yeah. Y\u2019all should\u2019ve done your birthday celebration on a different night with a different activity. That\u2019s where her being wrong ends.\n\nYou absolutely DO have a problem with her being besties with a man. How many times did you need to remind us he\u2019s gay? Did you think she\u2019d give her best friend\u2019s ticket (that she bought and planned before y\u2019all were together) to you? None of that is reasonable. Grow up. \n\nHow old is your partner?", "Esh. She got a surprise extra seat for you. It probably was t possible to get them close together. But handled it poorly, and prob should've asked before she gave you the ticket", "ESH\n\nI would be pissed if I got shitty seating and my partner and their friend was sitting in better seating up front. I would actually refuse to go.\n\nPeople aren't entitled to gifts or even a celebration of their birth. It's something that happens every day for lots of people. With that being said, trying to pretend this is a gift for me and then not even sitting with me is not a gift, it's exclusion.\n\nThe problem I'm having is you just want to punish her. This isn't healthy and ultimately just comes down as petty revenge. If you care about your realtionship, this wouldn't even be a consideration.\n\nAnyways, don't feel too bad, ultimately eight months is a flash in the pan, nothing remarkable when it comes to realtionships.", "Your feeling is valid and your gf is super inconsiderate. If she didn\u2019t see that point or didn\u2019t contact you, what more you can expect for this relationship to continue. Move on!", "NTA with a bit of YTA because I feel like you\u2019re being a bit unreasonable. However, my opinion is different based on when the ticket was bought.\n\n1. The ticket was bought when she was already in a relationship with you.\n\nI think it\u2019s reasonable to be upset, especially if she knew you like the same theatre prior to the relationship. It might\u2019ve been an oversight on her part, maybe this was something they\u2019ve been wanting to do for a long time and she was only thinking about the two of them. Which is sad but understandable, you two have been in this relationship only for a short while.\n\n2. The ticket was bought before your relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to be slightly upset but you have to get over it. She\u2019s planned this for them before you were together, of course the seat would be his. For me making a big fuss over it makes it a small YTA situation. \n\n\u2014\nAll in all, this probably could\u2019ve been handled better. She should\u2019ve just not bought the tickets for you and do something else for your bday. Maybe wait for another theatre by the same director, idk how easily that would be.\n\nUltimately though, you were a bit much in my opinion. Considering the fact she booked a year in advance, those tickets probably were hard to come by and expensive. And I\u2019m assuming she had to search for a bit to find your ticket. I feel like she at least made an effort to include you but she didn\u2019t think it through it didn\u2019t come across the way she liked it to.\n\nThe fact that this was taken to the point that you aren\u2019t talking to each other is a bit\u2026 meh. If you genuinely like her and want this relationship to work, I\u2019d suggest making the first move and apologise for how you reacted. Maybe have another talk with her about it now that things are probably more calm.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your reply is such passive aggressive dude.", "Maybe so, but he is going to a performance that he wanted to see, as opposed to not going at all.", "Point still remains that his birthday gift was a night sitting alone as a third wheel. Doubt she meant it as a slight but I wouldn\u2019t be thrilled with the idea of doing that.", "Instead of telling her he felt like she was choosing her friend over him, he could of said , how about we exchange this ticket and make plans for the two of us? \n\nI agree the last minute addition was not a great idea, but his statement of the tickets showing she was choosing between him and her friend is a bridge too far for me. She was trying to include him the best way she could."]}
