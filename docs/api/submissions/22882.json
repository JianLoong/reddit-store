That doesn't (at all) mean \"sit alone while I'm somewhere else having a better time than you\" is a good birthday gift.

Don\u2019t do that. Talk to her and get her to understand your perspective. Then do more drastic things if she didn\u2019t. It seems like she doesn\u2019t understand where she went wrong.

It's uncomfortable. I'd feel like an afterthought. \n\nOn the flipside, if I bought my significant other an expensive gift for his birthday that I was sure he would love, and he reacted negatively to it, I'd be put out. \n\nI don't think either of you are AH.

Most people like to feel like they\u2019re best friends with their partners. And it can make you feel insecure or hurt if/when it seems like they prioritize a \u201cregular\u201d friend over you. However, when the friend and your partner are the same gender (and their gender is different than yours), it much easier to avoid making comparisons. You can tell yourself that it\u2019s a different type of relationship and you are still the closest \u201cmale\u201d in your partners life. When your partner\u2019s friend is the same gender as you, however, it\u2019s much harder not to make the comparison. So, I get it. Your feelings are valid. You\u2019re allowed to be hurt.", "NTA.

Sometimes I\u2019ve had to do this at soccer matches with my two lads, but they get to sit together and I sit elsewhere. They love it, having independence time together. Completely different to your scenario. \n\nI think you can both get over this easily though. She made a mistake. Surprise gifts are always a risk, so it may be best to agree to always discuss things like this first.", "NTA. You were an afterthought at best.

Naturally, the seats beside them were no longer available. \n\nA theatrical production is not the same as a dinner. You should not be talking during the performance anyway, and you can meet up during intermission and go out together after.

It had nothing to do with you. It was an event arranged between her and her friend.

You are acting like an unappreciative dick. Yes, ideally you'd be next to them but we can't alter reality to our choosing.\n\nYou are being unreasonably jealous here.", "I think you're wrong.  The tickets were bought before you were even in the picture.  Presumably the gay friend was paying her back for his ticket, or else they had a reciprocal arrangement where they'd alternate paying for theatre trips.  Maybe it was his birthday, too.\n\nYou came along.  She told you about the tickets, explained the situation to you.  You were disappointed that... what, that she hadn't bought two tickets in advance fantasizing that she'd meet a mysterious someone who would want to go with her?  Nope.  She bought the tickets for herself and her friend.\n\nShe refused to bump her friend.  But she was kind enough to get you a ticket to the same performance.  Instead of being grateful for the consideration, you sulked.  Were you anticipating chatting throughout the performance?  You could have rendezvoused at the bar during the interval, gone for a meal together before or after the show.  Instead, you made it a Big Deal.\n\nWould it have been better if she had not taken the trouble to obtain a ticket for you at all?\n\nYou are definitely being silly about her having a guy friend to go to the theatre with.  Their relationship is of longer standing than yours, but, well, she was with you, wasn't she?  Frankly, I don't understand your POV either.  You seem to have acted childishly.  And you're still blaming her for not considering your point of view.\n\nYes, YTA.", "NTA - sometimes things just aren't meant to be", "YTA. These tickets were bought before you were in the picture. It sounds like you let your emotions show easily. You were disappointed when she told you about the tickets and I am sure it was obvious. So, she tries to be courteous and buy a ticket for you to the same play. Of course they could not be beside each other, she bought the other tickets way before she knew you. She (naively) thought this would make you happy. Of course, no one wants to sit alone in a theatre on their birthday, but she had previous commitments. Why are you TA? Because you admitted that the only reason you are upset is because the friend is a guy. There is an insecurity there and you are pushing it on her. Remember, 8 months is not marriage. This incident may cause her to rethink her relationship with you.", "Soft YTA. What did you expect her to do? Her ticket is hers, her friend's is not so the only thing she can decide to do is to give you her ticket and you'll sit with him. Does that sound any better ?? She can't and should absolutely not try to have her friend give you his ticket, they bought them before you came along. The only other option would have been not to buy you a ticket at all and you'd have missed out completely. Honestly the situation sucks but you did react rather immaturely for a 40yr old. You'll see them before and after but if it really feels bad then tell her you won't come and that you want the 2 of you to do something together at some other point.", "YTA - this was pre-arranged before you were even in the picture. Your explanation about the dinner doesn\u2019t hold any water as it\u2019s not the same situation at all. The theatre is a place you go to watch and be quiet, not sit and chat like you do in a restaurant. Nothing stopping you all going out before or after, or catching up at interval. \n\nYou say you love this particular director, and clearly the show was on sale way before you and your GF met so there was nothing stopping you from getting tickets. It was nice of her to get you a ticket for your birthday. \n\nYour POV is immature and you\u2019re quite clearly jealous. I think your reaction would have been the same even if it wasn\u2019t your birthday.", "YTA. She bought those tickets for her friend *before she even met you*. That ticket was already his. She bought your ticket later, when seats in the front would have been either unavailable or unreasonably expensive. I get that it kinda sucks, but you're blowing this WAY out of proportion. If it was your only birthday present I can see that not being the best, but as long as she got you other stuff then you're just throwing a hissyfit because she's keeping the commitments she's made.", "NTA, getting you a ticket for your birthday to sit on your own is a terrible idea. She could have gone another day with you, or just left it and done something else for your birthday. \n\nBut a \u2018we\u2019ll sit here and you have a seat in the back on your own\u2019 is not very nice. It\u2019s not about her and the friend going, it\u2019s about her birthday present to you being tickets on your own in the back. \n\nYTA for being bothered that she is going with a man. They had tickets, great good for them. You shouldn\u2019t be jealous or feel like she picked him, she\u2019s allowed to have friends and go to things without you.

She didn't know you when she bought the tickets.", "[deleted]", "YTA. They bought the tickets even before you started dating. She had only 1 ticket, 2nd ticker is her friend's. But since you shown interest too,  she bought you 3rd one. Obviously, if play is popular, it is safe to assume that the best tickets were sold out. So. Now you want her friend to give you his ticket? He has no obligation to do so for you. Or you want her to give you her ticket, so you would be sitting there with her friend?", "YTA. Was it tacky for her to get you a lesser ticket? Yeah. Y\u2019all should\u2019ve done your birthday celebration on a different night with a different activity. That\u2019s where her being wrong ends.\n\nYou absolutely DO have a problem with her being besties with a man. How many times did you need to remind us he\u2019s gay? Did you think she\u2019d give her best friend\u2019s ticket (that she bought and planned before y\u2019all were together) to you? None of that is reasonable. Grow up. \n\nHow old is your partner?", "Esh. She got a surprise extra seat for you. It probably was t possible to get them close together. But handled it poorly, and prob should've asked before she gave you the ticket", "ESH\n\nI would be pissed if I got shitty seating and my partner and their friend was sitting in better seating up front. I would actually refuse to go.\n\nPeople aren't entitled to gifts or even a celebration of their birth. It's something that happens every day for lots of people. With that being said, trying to pretend this is a gift for me and then not even sitting with me is not a gift, it's exclusion.\n\nThe problem I'm having is you just want to punish her. This isn't healthy and ultimately just comes down as petty revenge. If you care about your realtionship, this wouldn't even be a consideration.\n\nAnyways, don't feel too bad, ultimately eight months is a flash in the pan, nothing remarkable when it comes to realtionships.", "Your feeling is valid and your gf is super inconsiderate. If she didn\u2019t see that point or didn\u2019t contact you, what more you can expect for this relationship to continue. Move on!", "NTA with a bit of YTA because I feel like you\u2019re being a bit unreasonable. However, my opinion is different based on when the ticket was bought.\n\n1. The ticket was bought when she was already in a relationship with you.\n\nI think it\u2019s reasonable to be upset, especially if she knew you like the same theatre prior to the relationship. It might\u2019ve been an oversight on her part, maybe this was something they\u2019ve been wanting to do for a long time and she was only thinking about the two of them. Which is sad but understandable, you two have been in this relationship only for a short while.\n\n2. The ticket was bought before your relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to be slightly upset but you have to get over it. She\u2019s planned this for them before you were together, of course the seat would be his. For me making a big fuss over it makes it a small YTA situation. \n\n\u2014\nAll in all, this probably could\u2019ve been handled better. She should\u2019ve just not bought the tickets for you and do something else for your bday. Maybe wait for another theatre by the same director, idk how easily that would be.\n\nUltimately though, you were a bit much in my opinion. Considering the fact she booked a year in advance, those tickets probably were hard to come by and expensive. And I\u2019m assuming she had to search for a bit to find your ticket. I feel like she at least made an effort to include you but she didn\u2019t think it through it didn\u2019t come across the way she liked it to.\n\nThe fact that this was taken to the point that you aren\u2019t talking to each other is a bit\u2026 meh. If you genuinely like her and want this relationship to work, I\u2019d suggest making the first move and apologise for how you reacted. Maybe have another talk with her about it now that things are probably more calm.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I genuinely want to know what people think.)", "you just stated my exact point. they are both viewing the performance but it might as well be at seperate times. doing something with someone and doing the same thing as someone is very different", "I\u2019d never do this. This is an analogy I used to explain her why I felt the way I did. I never said anything before she pressed me. I tried to hide my emotional reaction but failed.", "That\u2019s not what I said at all.\n\nNo 2 performances are exactly the same. There could be an understudy. A mistake that happens onstage. A line that hits differently. An audience that reacts differently. That\u2019s what is so magical about live theater. Theater fans treasure those little differences so much. We see a show twice just to notice those things. We watch new shows evolve from early drafts to final forms. We have heated debates about which actors are the best in long-running shows. Like, ask me who my favorite Glinda in Wicked is and I will give you a whole dissertation. Ask me about my favorite moment in a live performance as an actress (Grease, summer camp, when Sandy got locked out of the building just before an entrance and the lead T-Birds had to riff on a throwaway line about Annette Funicello\u2019s boobs to fill the time.)\n\nThree people at the same show on the same night in the same place are not going to have identical experiences but they\u2019re going to see the same show. Same cast, same slight variations, same line delivery, same applause lines and laugh lines. It\u2019s not an experience that can be recreated at a different showing.\n\nEveryone in that audience at that performance is seeing those same moments that nobody else will ever see again.\n\nThings absolutely hit a little differently depending on where you sit and who you\u2019re with, but the girlfriend put in the effort to give OP the closest thing to a shared experience that she can given the circumstances.", "they are watching the same show like the same movie. it\u2019s exactly the same. except they aren\u2019t watching it together they are watching separately. they will get the same experience but they won\u2019t be together.", "Did you read a single word I wrote?\n\nIf I watch a movie today and you watch a movie a year from now, barring a director\u2019s cut or something, it\u2019s the same movie. You don\u2019t suddenly get a different actor in one of the roles. No lines are going to be delivered with a different emphasis. Movies are static. Every time you watch them, you know exactly what they\u2019re going to get.\n\nIf I watch a play today and I watch it next week, the script may be the same but the humans performing it, seeing as they are not robots, are not going to do precisely the same thing.\n\nYou should try theater. It\u2019s awesome.", "they are watching it the same night. and im am avid theatre watcher.", "What makes you think she didn\u2019t notice your reaction to the tickets being for the friend? Maybe that\u2019s why she got you a ticket? Also could she have gotten you a seat with them considering it was a bit late?", "INFO: what does being gay have to do with anything?", "NTA, holy crap.", "NTA. She made it worse by making you an afterthought.  I wouldn't want to sit alone on my birthday either.", "NTA \n\nI think MOST people would have this reaction. She didn\u2019t think of you period, then she shoved you in the back to make SURE you knew you were an afterthought? \n\nShe is playing dumb, she knows EXACTLY what your problem is. Platonic or not, that would piss me tf off too.", "NTA.  She\u2019s asking you to be third wheel on your birthday.  Not cool at all.", "She could either bought the extra ticket and arranged another friend to sit with her friend, or just not bothered buying the extra ticket. Going to a theatre with a friend, which was arranged a year ago, whilst you can do literally anything else is not a bad thing and didn't need fixing.\n\nNTA for being upset. The ticket is basically saying \"come watch me and my friend have fun from the back\".", "NAH the resentment on both sides is unfortunate", "Look she bought the tickets before she even met you. You were sad and wanted to go so she got you a ticket. From the sounds of things and seeing as she had to buy tickets a year in advance there probably weren\u2019t extras next to her. I get it\u2019s annoying but I don\u2019t know what else she\u2019s meant to do about you going to see this performance. \n\nYou comparison isn\u2019t the same and your girlfriend would be an awful friend to give up her friends ticket that she bought for him to someone that didn\u2019t even know her at the time of buying them", "NTA. I am not sure that I agree that your emotional reaction was immature. This is just an odd way for her to prioritize your birthday and her friend.\n\nPart of celebrating someone's birthday is making sure that that person feels valued and appreciated. That wasn't accomplished by sticking you in the back of the theatre *alone*.\n\nIf the friend was a true friend, he would have understood if she told him that it was your birthday and she and you should sit in the front and he can sit in the back. In my opinion, breaking up is prolly a good thing for you in the long term. In a marriage your spouse should never come in second to other people (except maybe very small children/babies - occasionally).\n\nSorry about the heart ache.", "NTA. It was just a terrible gift idea on the part of your girlfriend. She should rather have taken you somewhere nice or to a different show. Asking you to sit on your own at the back is pretty sh*tty. I think she just miscalculated though and didn't consider it may be a bad gift. She thought she was doing something nice. This is a silly thing to break up over when the intention was good but the execution was poor.", "NTA\n\nWho this person is does not matter -- it's just not a gift to spend an event sitting alone knowing your partner is sitting elsewhere with someone else. NEVERMIND that their seats are excellent and yours is crappy. It would be moderately kinder if she was like, I could only afford one good seat in front and so it's yours - but that's not even it at all. \n\nHonestly the fact that she doesn't get that this is not cool FOR A BDAY GIFT is the big issue. If it was just a random show or something it would matter less but any gift should be you with the person in question", "NTA.  Your birthday gift was to be the barely-included third wheel to your GF and her friend.  That's *super* fucked up.", "NTA - This one is rather complicated. \n\nFor everyone (except her) to win, she should have taken the rear seat and encouraged you to enjoy the good seats with gay friend, sucking it up in the honor of your birthday. \n\nAlternatively, gay friend could have sacrificed *his* seat for the two of you to sit together but that's super shitty for him - honestly it's not as fun of a show for him to sit next to you either (no offense) so every option sucks. \n\nReally it would have been better to buy no ticket at all.", "NTA in this case.  I get that she had these plans before you and yeah it sucks it takes place on your birthday but I think she was inconsiderate to buy a ticket in the back.  I mean who the hell would think that's a good idea, especially when your going to the same show, to the same director you like and their sitting in prime seats whole you're in the nose bleeds but still come on, you've got some insecurities you need too work on.\n\nI mean your both pretty new to this relationship so I'd just take a breath, apologize for having a immature reaction, tell her to have fun at the show, tell her you'd like to talk about your feelings and relationship after your birthday, and hang out with your own friends on your birthday and enjoy your day too.  After that, keep your insecurities in check and have that conversation with her and how you feel about how you felt you didn't feel she prioritize your on a day that's important to you.", "So, let me make sure I understand. Your gf and her friend bought tickets to a show BEFORE you met and started dating. You found out about it and were disappointed. Seri g your disappointment, she bought you your own ticket for your birthday but at this point, wasn\u2019t able to get you a seat with them.\n\nYou claim you have no problem with her having male, gay friends, but also state that you would not be as upset if the friend she was going with was a woman.\n\nDo you hear yourself? YTA for sure. She tried to do something nice for you and you went all homophobic.\n\nEnjoy single life.", "ESH\n\n\nYou suck because it is a man plays a bigger factor than if it was a woman. I have a lot of male friends and so sometimes I do things with them like plays, games, opera, video games, corn mazes, etc.\n\n\n\nShe sucks because she should have not gotten you a ticket. She should have did something else with you. It is shitty to buy you a lone ticket by yourself", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t very nice of her to expect you to sit alone in the back on your birthday. The better choice would\u2019ve been to get two tickets for another day that you could sit together.", "Big bang theory did this with Howard, Raj and Stewart.  Raj and Stewart had tickets to the Sound of Music sing along, and when Howard came by they suggested he come with and get a scalped ticket.  Howard didn't like the idea of sitting alone while his friends sat elsewhere in the same theater, so Raj suggested that Howard and Stewart swap seats at intermission, but then Stewart didn't want to sit alone during the last half.  Howard decided to just decline to go rather than mess with their plans or sit alone in the theater.\n\n\nYour solution is the best one, she should have gotten them both tickets to a different show so they could sit together.  Instead, she expected him to celebrate his birthday by sitting alone in the back of the theater while she and her friend sat in the front row of the same show.  Anyone would be uncomfortable and unhappy with that arrangement.", "yeah but part of the fun was for them to enjoy the show together and make comments together maybe, etc - not the same experience for boyfriend and gay friend who are mere acquaintences\n\nfrom seat dynamics though I agree with your solution", "Why would he want to sit with her gay friend? He's not HIS  friend.", "Sure. But these two have only been dating for 8 months. There is still a lot for them to learn about each other. Imo she should have asked OP if he'd want the ticket for his birthday present even if she couldn't get a seat next to or near their seats *before* buying it. Then he could have said yes or no, and gf would have learned something new about OP.", "Yes", "No, I mean out of pettiness. I would rather ruin their fun than sulk in the backseat lol", "That would be an asshole thing to do if they talk during the performance", "You love her more than she loves you. Not considering your feelings on your first birthday together is cold. Is that what you want for the rest of your relationship? What else are you willing to accept?", "That would help, but even thinking her partner would want to come to an event just to sit in a way worse seat completely removed from theirs seems silly", "Yes I don\u2019t get the people who don\u2019t see this", "What if he would? As how would she feel in similar situation. It is a question, not punishment."]}
