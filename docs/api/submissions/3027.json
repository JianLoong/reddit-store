I woke up at around 1 pm and my girlfriend asked me again if we could go somewhere and do something but I said I need to relax and rest. She was upset by this. When I went in my room to play Fortnite, she walked in and saw what I was doing, she just stared at me and said \u201creally\u201d and left. Then I got Uber eats to deliver me food and she got mad at that because she said we could have gone to the restaurant instead. I ordered dinner on Uber eats too and that\u2019s when she got mad, she started yelling and said she\u2019s never going to anything for me ever again. Aita?

Then she could have recovered her day off and gone to do something with a friend.   \n\n\nIt sounds like she kept waiting for you to be ready to hang out with her and go for dinner and you stuck yourself in a room and ordered food without her.", "ESH, neither of you are actually communicating needs and wants and neither of you is taking the other\u2019s needs  and wants into consideration. She should have discussed her wishes to spend time with you and you should have realized that she wanted to spend time with you and cut off the game for an hour or two to make her feel wanted and respected. But her getting mad and you ignoring your role in making her mad with neither of you discussing with each other is recipe for being single by Christmas.", "No judgement but both of you need to learn to communicate better. I have to say though, waking someone up at 7am on their day off is criminal behaviour.", "ESH, for the lack of communication. It's totally fine to want a day off to play video games, especially since your girlfriend gave you no heads up. And she shouldn't have yelled.\n\nBut, since you knew you wanted to do that, why not say so? You start off by telling her you want to sleep in. She lets you. As far as she's concerned, you'll sleep in, and then you both can go and do something - because all you've said is that you want a lie in. Then, she sees you playing video games, ordering food, etc. This is all totally fine imo, but why not say \"I planned to spend this day decompressing and playing games-- I love you but just need a day of solo downtime right now.\"", "NTA...\n\nI'm married to a gamer.  If we need a \"couples\" day then that gets communicated ahead of time.\n\nBoth of us have stressful jobs.  I decompress by reading books all day.  He decompresses by battling God knows what, on his computer.\n\nYour girlfriend should not have surprised you by taking off of work.  She should have planned a \"couples\" thing a day or two before so that the expectation would be set in that direction.\n\nSo, you're NTA, but you still need to make this right.  Plan a \"couples\" day together.  Make her feel special and discuss your decompression needs with her.  Listen as she discusses her own with you.", "[deleted]", "I get wanting to game and I get wanting to complete a goal, but you really could have taken a dinner break. That would have been a fine compromise. She would have gotten some time with you and you would still be able to reach your goal.", "NAH.\n\nYou need to communicate better. She made assumptions and took the day off, and she should have communicated that.

Don\u2019t be surprised if she leaves soon.", "Was going nta initially due to your gf surprising you, but the fact that you played all day and ordered uber eats (twice!) instead of getting some food with her is ridiculous. Totally TA.\nWhen you look back on life you won't remember the hours grinding on fortnite, you'll remember the time shared with the special people in your life though. Take a break mate, spend some time with her, then if you have to, go back and play the game.\nTo be honest you may actually have a video game addiction which is a very real issue, set some personal boundaries on gaming and stick to them, live your real life as well as your online one", "YTA because while, technically, you do deserve to have your day off and do whatever you want, you were an asshole for completely blowing off your girlfriend and not communicating your free day expectations to her.\n\nHaving a partner means commitment to another person. It means investing yourself in spending time with them. And yes, sometimes it means compromising, and from your post it sounded like you weren't open to that at all. Your girlfriend was mad because she was feeling like you're prioritizing a game over her, and she's right. If you'd rather prioritize a game over your relationship, don't be in one.\n\n[I'm not saying OP shouldn't play at all, just that if he wants a partner, he will also have to find the time for her, which, from his post it did not sound like he was doing.]", "ESH. \n\nShe should have communicated prior and you are entitled to rest, but why not split your time? Being in a relationship is about compromise. You could have played in the morning, then gone out for dinner/spent time with her in the evening.

A lot of seemingly inexperienced people in this thread who don\u2019t know much about relationships.\n\nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re an introvert, which is why a day off for you is closing off to the world and playing a game. I\u2019m the same, and so is my fiance. We have to go out sometimes, but given the choice, we both sit at home, play games and recharge. We even have a joint gaming room. \n\nHere lies your problem - you\u2019re not compatible. If a day off for your girlfriend is a day out, she\u2019s more likely an extrovert, or at least a high functioning introvert. This means she recharges by doing things, meeting people. You are the opposite. You probably recharge by taking time to yourself and relaxing. The two of you are not compatible in any way.\n\nYou\u2019re the AH, not for what you did, but for not recognising you have different needs. She\u2019s the AH, not for wanting to go out, but for not recognising you have different needs. \n\nEnd it before you resent each others way of life, because neither of your ways of enjoying days off are wrong - they simply do not work together.\n\nEdit: spelling", "As an introvert if someone forced their way into my day off without letting me know they were going to be off too ahead of time I would be equally annoyed. However not asking if she wanted something when ordering food kinda sucked.", "ESH \n\nYes you get to do what you want on your day off. Yes she should have communicated better. But the moment you ordered takeout without even asking if she wanted anything you crossed a line.", "I'm going with ESH. She should have told you she planned to take the day off, but was it really hard to play for like half a day and then do something with her?", "Nta. She should've told you she was taking the day off. Sounds like you were having a rest day.", "NTA because she didn't make her expectations clear ahead of time but you might not have a gf for much longer if you ignore her.", "NTA because she didn\u2019t communicate with you and you don\u2019t really owe her anything just because she got certain ideas in her own head. I do think if this is a common thing though, you need to talk about it because it sounds like you may often prioritize gaming based on her reaction. And honestly, she might be close to leaving you.", "NTA not everyone likes \"surprises\" of going somewhere for entire day. Tbh sometimes that's also tiring. I fully understand your desire of a lazy day. Also just because you're couple doesn't mean you have to spend every free minute together. Me and my bf sometimes play together, other time alone or everyone with their friends. I don't get mad that for example he wants to spend evening playing with his buds because as i said he doesn't have to spend 100% of his time with me and he also have other people he want to talk with than just me. After all i have him for me most of the time \ud83d\ude1c", "NAH, but it looks like you guys aren\u2019t compatible. It\u2019s ok to want to kick back, play computer games and order takeaway to relax. It\u2019s also ok to want to get some fresh air, visit an attraction and go to a restaurant. Both sets of wishes need to be balanced. If that can\u2019t be done, better to end this sooner rather than later.", "NTA  \nShe didn't even try to communicate with you before hand and to me it sounds like she demanded you do stuff with her. \n\nI am 29 and a woman. I would be pissed if someone I was dating did this to me. \n\nCommunication is needed.   \n\"{Insert girlfriend name} Why did you not communicate with me before this morning that you wanted to do stuff together today? I already had plans. I am not even halfway though the full battle pass of my game and wanted to relax and play games today.\"  \n\n\nShe is not communicating. I just hit level 200 today to get all the battle pass items", "TA - I mean you could\u2019ve at least spoke to her, she tried to surprise you by taking a day off and you ignored her all day? Spending time with your gf should be relaxing and if you didn\u2019t go out for food you could\u2019ve at least cooked with her", "Info: did you communicate to her what you wanted to do with your day off at any point?", "ESH with a side of YTA. \nShe could've told you she took the day off, but playing Fortnite the whole day and ordering food because you want to reach a certain level sounds not just assholish, but like an addiction problem", "I tend to say YTA. Although you planned to take a whole day to play ur game (which is your right), you could have at least warned her that that\u2019s exactly how you want your day to be. \nNow she wanted to surprise you and that\u2019s a beautiful gesture. You could have at least acknowledge her effort and spend a meal together.", "Nta you specifically took a day off to stay home and relax doing nothing. That's it end of story, that's exactly what you did. Your gf taking an uncommunicated, unplanned day off doesn't mean she can just wake you up and dictate your entire day or any of it because she feels like it. You wanted a day off I'm assuming as a break from work and life, to just do nothing which I totally get and do sometimes.", "NTA, you planned this and wanted to relax. Your girlfriend didn't tell you ahead of time that she wants to spent time with you. I totally get you, some days you just want to stay home and play games/watch TV.", "ESH. She could have communicated better and in advance that she wanted to spend the day with you. But also you could have taken some time out of gaming to at least have a meal together.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is asking you to spend time with her because she has a need for connection. You shut her down. My husband spends a lot of time watching let\u2019s plays and playing video games in his free time, but when I tell him I need some of his attention, he sets what he is doing aside and gives it to me. There\u2019s nothing wrong with indulging your hobbies, but not at the expense of your relationships.", "You booked a day off. You planned to sleep in, then relax by doing your hobby. That sounds completely reasonable.\n\nShe decided to book the same day off that you had, and planned to go out together. That also sounds reasonable.\n\nBut the plans clashed, and both of you *completely failed* at communicating your respective plans to each other.\n\nAnswering strictly the question asked, no you are not T A for failing to completely drop your plans for the day to instead do exactly what she wanted to surprise you with, particularly given she \\*still\\* wasn't telling you what her plan was.\n\nBut ... this is definitely an ESH situation on the communications front. Both of you need to learn to talk to the other person what your plans are. I get communication is a bit difficult when woken up unexpectedly too early in the morning, but at least at the 1pm slot there should have been a discussion about what the plan for the day is.", "ESH. You are totally entitled to spend your day however you please, and yes she should have communicated beforehand what she wanted to do, and not woken you up. That was really rude and inconsiderate.\n\nBut, you knew she wanted go go somewhere. When you got up it would have been nice to give her a heads up that your plans were to game and not go anywhere all day. \n\nAlso did you just order a meal without asking her if she wanted any? Because that's rude IMO.", "NTA. My husband is an AVID gamer. It's his thing. On his days off, I know what his plans are. If I want to spend a day with him, I tell him in advance and we talk about it. I don't assume his time is my time. That's selfish. OP told her that he wanted to relax. Nothing more needs to be said imo. She got huffy cuz she wasn't getting her way. She sucks.", "NAH but you\u2019re just kinda a dick. you weren\u2019t excited to do anything with her?", "Info: are you sure you're 25? \n\nI'd understand maybe a 4-5 hour stint, but not to spend any time with her at all... are you sure you actually like her?", "YTA for not spending some time with her. Even if it was unplanned, that\u2019s part of the social contract. By being together you\u2019re agreeing to be there for each other and work with the other persons flaws (such as not planning appropriately). If you need to rush it you and her could\u2019ve gone out and eaten together in less than an hour. Instead, your actions told her you\u2019d rather play video games than spend any time at all with her", "NTA\n\nWhy is she forcing you to do stuff with her?\n\nWhy cant she do stuff with you instead?\n\nShe doesnt seem like she any respect for your day off\n\nGet rid of her", "YTA because you take your girlfriend for granted.

That's assholish on per part. But also why didn't you let her know as well? Do you guys not live together?\n\nShe made it known at 7am that she wanted to spend the day with you. You didn't tell her plans here either.\n\nYou woke up at 1pm and still would not communicate. \n\nYou ordered food for... you alone? I don't understand this part. Did you ask her what she wanted? How did you not talk to each other at this point either. \n\nIf your day does not involve her at all why not let her know she's wasting her time straight away? Sounded like you wanted a break from her as well.", "YTA. Even if you didn\u2019t want to go anywhere, why couldn\u2019t you at least compromise and tell your gf \u201cHey, I don\u2019t really want to leave the house today, but let\u2019s make some popcorn and watch a movie on the couch tonight?\u201d Or anything to that effect that clarified that you actually do want to spend time with her? Even if she hadn\u2019t gotten some time off, to me it\u2019s like basic social etiquette to limit your personal gaming time when you have an opportunity to spend some time with someone you supposedly like.\n\nA lot of comments here seem immature. You could have stopped playing anytime between 1 and whenever you went to bed for a few hours to do something with your gf. It sounds like you didn\u2019t even ask her if she wanted food! This isn\u2019t about going out or dramatically changing plans, this is about showing your gf you care about her. Your final line in your post shows your priorities. Your goals for a game seem more important than spending any time with her.", "nah here but im guessing you work alot so she took the same day off so you could spend time together but you decided that a game which can be played at anytime any place was more important then spending time with someone who took a day off to spend time with you ....  im guessing she will never do that again even if you ask... i hope she finds someone who loves her as much as you love your games console", "NTA. As in, she won't be the asshole when she leaves you for being deeply uninteresting. Do what you want man, but don't be surprised when she leaves you for someone who actually gives her a little attention and respect.", "YTA\n\nEven though your girlfriend took the day off of work to suprise you with possibly fun day/outing, you pretty much just blew her off rudely saying that you needed to rest. When she saw you playing Fortnite, she probably thought something like that you didn\u2019t want to go with her to play games instead. Instead of apologizing or something and trying to make it up to her, you went on Reddit to try and get validation for your actions. Even if you wanted to relax, is having a chill day with your girlfriend not relaxing? Seems like you just wanted an excuse to be lazy for the day and just play some video games.", "NTA if she wanted to surprise you I get that but then confirm first your plans. I don't agree with forcing your self on someones day off. Sometimes people want to stay home and nope out of life and that's alright.", "ESH, but you are bigger.  I'm introvert too.  Not gamer but I prefer  my books or movies or my mobile games.  I love weekends, when I can stay home and cuddle with my puppy.  I know I want not bf because I'm selfish with my time and I work from home but many time I'm still on my work laptop 8 pm.   But I have people who are important for me and I can change my plans for them, evenin lastminute. You have gf.  When you're in relationship,  you can't be selfish with your time,  or stay single.", "I'm gonna go with YTA here because it really sounds like there were numerous times during the day when you could have compromised a little to make her happy, but you consistently chose to ignore her very clear requests to spend time together. If I'm reading it right, you ordered food to the house twice? Why didn't you go out to dinner after she stated the first time that she would have liked to have gone out to the restaurant with you? You could have had your relaxing day in while sacrificing an hour or two to go out for food with her. Video games aren't more important than people, my guy.", "YTA, not for wanting to \u201crest and relax\u201d but for not communicating that that means to you \u201cspend the whole day alone playing Fortnite.\u201d\n\nHer surprise of a day off was unwelcome, sure. Waking you up at 7 sucks but she let you sleep in until 1PM.

You'd rather game all day alone than spend even an hour or two with her? I'd have been pretty hurt too, that you preferred a game over her company for the whole day.\n\nI've been with my husband for 15 years, and I'd love a day off together, even if it were a surprise. (And I wonder if she asked if you had any plans for your day off, and you said no, just going to relax. Which she probably took to mean you were free and wouldn't mind relaxing with her. Aren't there any shows you two watch together? Couldn't you even pause for a meal and to check in with her? What if she wanted to connect with you about something, share some good / bad news with you, ask for your advice about something important? I mean, you didn't say she does this all the time, so what if she had an important reason? You didn't even ask.)\n\nYou were SO dismissive of her, even knowing she was there all day. You didn't seek her out once all day. You didn't accommodate her even one tiny bit. You didn't even say, oh, sorry, honey, I was really looking forward to just gaming all day and ordering takeout for myself.", "YTA. This was an everyone sucks situation due to poor or outright lack of communication. Once you ordered lunch without getting her lunch too then followed up doing the exact same for dinner, you became the full AH.\n\nYou wouldn't have even had to break to eat with her, but you should have eaten with her. You didn't even need to communicate with her to know she's not at work, it's lunch time/dinner time, and she'll want to eat something. Sure, you'd have to ask her what she wants, but dang that's a low bar for someone you call a girlfriend.", "I\u2019d be upset if someone woke me up early on my day off with a surprise. If they backed off and let me sleep until I woke up, no matter how late it was (in your case 1pm, 6 hours later) I\u2019d forgive them. \n\nAlmost every game has time sensitive aspects to keep you playing if you have no basic discipline or life. I turn off my game to spend time with my partner. He does the same for me.\n\nDo you want a girlfriend?\n\nEdit: YTA", "Both of you are aholes.

And if all you want do is play video games, you are going to have to find someone like that. \n\n\r  \nI\u2019m also worried about your health. How much time a week are you spending on games. Why did you feel the need to sleep in until 1pm (I\u2019m a single mom and I\u2019ve never needed to sleep that late)? Then you spent an entire day staring at a screen and having food delivered to your room. You do need to spend less time staring at a screen and moving around for your physical and mental health.", "NTA: quickly, she didn\u2019t tell you she was taking the day off, so you\u2019re not in the wrong.\n\nYou were enjoying your day the way you wanted to. In FACT, you should tell her next time that you just wanted some time to yourself that day and you guys should plan a day to spend together soon", "NTA..  she made a assumption and she was incorrect.. She should have asked you if you wanted to hang out, before taking the day off", "Nta", "YTA.  You should have been honest with your gf about your plans for the day and that none of them included her, including meals.  Don\u2019t go expecting to have a gf much longer if this is how you communicate with her when she tries to do something for your shared relationship.", "YTA. your girlfriend IS a little bit to blame since she should have communicated with you better and not simply expected your time. however, I also feel sorry for her because it seems like she was trying to surprise you and make you happy and it massively backfired. it sounds like you ordered food without involving her twice, which is a massive AH move in my opinion. You also don\u2019t need the entire day to play games, and you could very well have said \u201clet\u2019s go to dinner / cinema / date night / etc\u201d which would have obviously made the situation better for her. to keep the whole day to yourself rotting in front of a computer and waste her (albeit unexpected) day off when she just wanted a little time with you makes you a massive AH.", "I mean, NTA, but you're going to wind up single if you keep this up.", "ESH \n\nAll of these problems could have been avoided with a two minute conversation", "I still don\u2019t get adult men who play video games all day long but that\u2019s me. I would say ESH. You two need better communication skills", "Nta my gf knows sometimes I only get 1 day off and I need those for precious rest cause after that it's back to working another 5-6 days straight", "YTA. You're an adult in a relationship. How many adults get to wake up at 1pm and play games all day, even on their days off? I sure don't. I got stuff to do. Speaking of games, I know nothing of Fortnite, but if you have a high score, I'm guessing this means you spend a LOT of hours on it. You may even be on it every night. When do you spend time with the gf? \n\nDon't get me wrong. I will spend hours in bed reading or on my phone. Just last night I played WoW for a few hours before work (had to play my new Evoker!) You know what I also did? Spoke to my GF, ate dinner with her, and acted like I was an adult in a relationship. Some things require daily work. Pets, for example, or children. Often times, relationships need daily attention, too. Even if it's something small like hitti g the drive through together. What, you really couldn't throw on a pair of sweatpants and spend 30 minutes of your action-packed day to show someone you love then? Either grow up or break up. You're too immature to be in a relationship.", "NTA but you two need to communicate a little. \n\nMy husband and I share many interests but my love for the outdoors is not one of them, I also like to be doing things instead of being inside all the time. My ideal day off is going to the beach or have lunch at a cafe ect. His ideal day off is to ignore major chores and play video games. We compromised at once a fortnight we go and do something of my choice and once a year around my birthday (in the hottest month oc the year) we go camping for a long weekend. Once medical issues are taken care of and I can work again we'll renegotiate our time inside vs outside. I am happy to chill and play video games all day but as I've got medical issues it's all I'm doing right now and I'm bored XD \n\nCommunication is the most important part of a relationship.", "what changes this from an E S H to a YTA for me is that you didn't even ask your gf if she wanted anything from uber eats. she and you could've communicated better throughout the day, but it's rude to not even ask her if she wanted something", "The 7am thing sucks but you are being inconsiderate.", "Nta. It wasn't a planned day off for gf and it seems like she didn't communicate that she would take the day off, too, so you could hang out. Had she done that you could verbalize you needed a day to yourself to relax and plan another day to do stuff. You also needed verbalize when she woke you up that you wanted alone time so she could do whatever and not spend her day waiting. Thus was just a failure to communicate on both ends.", "YTA playing video games isn\u2019t that bad, but a whole day? Just go enjoy some time with your gf next time, if she even stays with you. There\u2019s over a week left to finish the battle pass, you\u2019ll be fine. Can\u2019t comprehend how people in this sub think planning to ignore your SO and play video games for an entire fucking day is remotely normal. A few hours, sure. But like why are you even dating and living with someone if your day off doesn\u2019t even involve them in any way? Don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re single soon if this is regular for you on days off.", "Going by just the title.. you're the asshole.\n\n^(Also, get in the shower..)", "I'm not old by any stretch but it amazes me how today's 20-somethings just continually level up at loserdom.  You wanted to play Fortnite all day?  The day off wasn't complete without crossing \"get to level 100\" off your to-do list?  YTA and your g/f is the A if she stays with you.  Imagine these two getting married.  Fast forward a few years to...sorry, honey, can't help with the kid, I'm in an epic battle on COD!", "I, personally, cannot comprehend the idea of a grown man taking a day off and spending it playing a video game. I don't think I'd like you very much, but that's ok, you probably wouldn't like me either. So, you are NTA. \n\nYou should, however, learn to communicate better with your girlfriend.", "NTA. She seems either a little co dependent or just really misses spending time with you. Either way try being more direct and explain what your plans are. Back in the day I use to wait for my now soon to be ex husband to hang out with me.

But def TA for ordering food for only you! Do you guys even talk? Why are you in a relationship?", "My partner and I try to plan a \u201csolo day\u201d once a week if possible and definitely every two weeks. It\u2019s a day where each person can do whatever they want without pressure from the other to occupy the time. This assumes each of us have kept up with our fair share of chores and other obligations. \nIt\u2019s a system that has worked well as I am someone who will always worry about a chore that needs done and this allows me time where I can do something fun. For them, it\u2019s about being able to space out and not keep track of time, watch shows I don\u2019t share an interest in and read fanfic or be on their phone. \nIt works well and I legit think all relationships can benefit from this arrangement. \nOP, I don\u2019t know if y\u2019all regularly plan dates but setting aside special dedicated time is something we both have to remember to do- passive time together often replaced dedicated date nights and focused time to give each other attention. That might be something you haven\u2019t noticed hasn\u2019t been happening as much lately and if so, an effort there would make her feel appreciated and like you want to spend time with her. \nIt also might be a good time to discuss how you love that she wants to spend time with you but you aren\u2019t entitled to each other\u2019s free time and maybe discuss the solo day.", "YTA\n\nUnless you just want to be single and this is your way of telling her.", "He knew the entire day he was going to do nothing but relax. That\u2019s perfectly fine. He could have just said it\u2019s my day off and I plan to sleep in and game. She planned a surprise and it didn\u2019t work out. Lesson learned. But ordering food twice without telling her? That\u2019s definitely messed up and selfish. They don\u2019t have to go out to dinner but you can tell your gf that lives with you that you\u2019re ordering food and ask if she wants anything.", "YTA- for multiple reasons- for starters, you didn't ask if she wanted any food and just ordered for yourself.... dick move. Next, you should have told her your plans to literally spend all day playing fortnite and would spend absolutely no time with her even though she had the day off as well. You could have taken an hour or 2 break to go eat like she said... asshole. Finally. I call bullsgit on playing all day and only being at level 97. I play fortnite and have thw battlpass. On Sunday I was on level 82. Hadn't played in a while. I played a few hours on Sunday morning and a hour or so last night and I am at level 102. It is super easy to level up right now if you haven't played in a while because there are a shit ton of challenges to do to level up quickly. YTA", "Sb\ud83d\udc40\ud83e\udda1", "Dude, you're 25 years old.  time to put down the video games.  \n\nLet me put this in a simple way you'll understand....   You're a gamer with a GF.  that's rare.   Now, either you can play with your joystick or she can.  If you spend your quality time on-line, I can promise the only hand on the joystick will be yours.", "YTA. Why have a girlfriend if all you want are you stupid video games?  You sound like a little kid. Hopefully she leaves you and finds someone who can actually love her.", "NTA. You had plans and she needs to respect that she can't just take a day off without warning and expect you to change them.\n\nYes, playing games and relaxing all day is plans. They are my favourite plans to make. I had a whole day of Raft last week, although I did have to make dinner although take out might have to be on my plans for my next gaming day.", "ESH\n\nBut this has to be a fucking joke right? This reads like a 15yo wrote it. Your girlfriend obviously wanted to spend time with you and you chose to play fortnite all day? That is fine but please break up with your girlfriend so she can go be with someone who actually wants to spend time with her. She is wasting her youth with you", "YTA\n\nShe tried to surprise you, and it was not what you wanted. Fine, that's kinda the risk of surprising someone.\n\nThen you said you wanted to 'rest and relax' and it seems she was willing to adjust her initial idea just fine. She waited the whole morning for you to wake up, only for you to ignore her and go play games by yourself. *as you planned*  \n\nAnd that's why yta, you should've just told her you did not want to spend ANY time with her.  You *knew* what your plans were, and you fid *not* want to change them. Again, that's fine. BUT it means you kept that information from her, and you LET her waste her time by being vague. \n'Rest and relax' could just as well mean hang *together* and watch a movie in your PJ's.", "It's fine you wanted to relax and game on your day off. We don't know the job you have, or if this was your first day off in a long time. We don't know your schedule. It's also fine your GF took the day off, but here's the thing I have an issue with. Why didn't you order Uber Eats for both of you? Why did you order only for yourself?\n\nNext time, you need to communicate with her, and she needs to communicate with you. \n\nThis is an ESH situation, but leans YTA for the Uber Eats thing...twice.", "NTA if she wanted to do something she should have asked ahead of time and told you she was taking off and even then no is an okay answer. The comments saying e s h or do you even like your gf are out of line. Sometimes you need a break to rest and recharge. I love my husband but sometimes I just want me time to recharge and that\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like spending time with him I just need a mental break from everyone.", "Based on just the information given here, NTA\n\nBut there\u2019s no way this is an isolated event. Sounds like she feels as if you brush her off for video games frequently and she wants to spend time with you. This has happened before hasn\u2019t it?", "Battlepass level 97? Man what a noob, I'm 186 lol. Just kidding obviously, but it's nice to see a fellow Fortnite player in the wild.\n\nI'm going mild NTA because I'm not sure how well you and your GF communicated before this day off happened. My husband and I make it pretty clear what our plans are for days off, either together or if we're on our own. It's more like him telling me \"Oh, I'll be working on my Steam Deck and playing Forza all day\" or something similar. And with me it's usually \"I'll be organizing the pantry and watching true crime youtube channels\" or something else. If we have a day off together, if he wants to work on a project or play a single player game, I let him do that and do my own project, read or play my own game. If we decide to do stuff together, we usually hash it out before the day comes, like planning to go pick up our comics (comic book store is 30-35 mins away) or going out to a movie, whatever.\n\nI will say this. You don't have to share 100% of your interests, but I know that it's nice that my husband and I have aligning interests, for the most part. We both play games on our own and together, watch movies, are interested in tech, comics, pro wrestling, etc. We both got into Fortnite, for example, during the Marvel season and we both pretty much play every day together now, for at least 30 minutes to do dailies and more if there are weeklies or other things to do. I'm not saying find a GF who plays Fortnite with you, but at least find one who understands your interests and accepts you for who you are and how you spend your time. :)", "are you my 10 year old?", "I think ESH because she shouldn't have \"surprised\" you with a day off together. She shouldn't have assumed you would have wanted to go anywhere but YOU should have communicated that you want to stay home the entire day. \nI am introverted and I don't really like \"going out\" not restaurants either because it overwhelms me. I'm lucky my husband is like me and so we both prefer to pick up our food or get it delivered and hang out at home. We do go to restaurants sometimes because our kids like to go and I try not to influence them to be antisocial like us \ud83e\udd23\nYou guys need to communicate better.", "On the one hand, you didn\u2019t know that your girlfriend was going to take the day off as well and you had already planned to be in the house, vegging out and playing video games. Once you found out that your gf did that so that she could spend the day with you, you should have been like fuck Fortnite. Or at least try to include her in your plans, like play video games together or something. But since you didn\u2019t do that, I can see your soon-to-be ex girlfriend saying the hell with y\u2019all\u2019s relationship and moving on to the next man and you\u2019ll have all the time in the world to play Fortnite. YTA", "Yta. You also are about to be single. Do you even like her? I woukd have broken up with you. You basically said the game is more important. Next time you wanna get laid I hope she says nope, I need to rest and eat from uber and talk to people on a game that ive never met. Lol.", "NTA but you both suck at communicating and you apparently have very different ideas of how to spend your leisure time. Rather than getting pissy about this and making it seem like your game is more important to you than she is, perhaps you could explain that you had a plan for self-care involving playing your game and that you'd have loved to make plans with her too but that you would like more warning in future and to make the plans together so that you can both look forward to what you're going to do and make a nice day off that works for both of you.", "NTA - Should you have communicated better possible, should your gf have communicated better 100%.   You have you day off and you had plans for that day.  If your gf specifically took a day off to she is the one who takes responsibility for communicating that with you and the plans that she wants for the day, which would have given you the opportunity to say you had plans to get to lvl 100 on fortnite.  All the y-t-a responses don't realize that \"having no plans\" is a plan for the day.  All the e-s-h kinda get that but thank you should change you plans for your gf and they may have a point.  But in my opinion she tried to surprise you with something that she likes and it just backfired on her.", "I mean, there's nothing wrong with wanting to play video games all day and order in, and your gf should have asked before booking the day off whether you wanted to spend the day with her.\n\nHowever, I'm going with YTA because you'd rather play a video game than hang out with your girlfriend. If I'd been planning to play games on my day off (as I usually do) but then found that my partner had the day off too, I'd be psyched to get to spend time with them instead! And that doesn't mean you should go out, but at least do something with her at home.", "YTA when you ordered food and didn't even ask if she wanted something. That move makes you an AH. You couldn't even spend 1 hour with her? Fine she didn't tell you.  But obviously, the game is more important than your girlfriend. Why are you even together? Hope she plans a girl night for herself.", "INFO: you sure you guys are dating? You don't seem to give a single shit about her.", "NTA. She tried to glom on to your day off, with the expectation that this would override whatever you had planned - even if it was doing absolutely nothing. \n\nFor some overworked introverts (myself included), the most productive self-care day is spent making zero decisions and completely \"winging it\" without any social pulls. Climbing into bed at night and being at peace with having accomplished nothing and having nothing to show for it is the ultimate recharge. She trampled your peace by necessitating you navigate her feelings while declining her surprise \"gift\".\n\nThe upside is that you now know to warn her when you need a day like this again. And she may learn that not everyone wants to spend their days off hustling to carpe diem.", "NTA, but it also doesn't sound like you're going to be a boyfriend for much longer either. Not many women want to stay with a man who would choose to sleep in until the afternoon, play hours of video games on end by himself, and not even bother to make lunch or dinner plans after she expressed interest in doing so. You're free to live the life you choose, it just doesn't sound very compatible for partnership.", "YTA you relaxed and slept till 1pm.\nGet your priorities in order. If your priority is Fortnite, please tell your girlfriend in case she hasn't already noticed.", "YTA , why do you have a girlfriend if you\u2019d rather play fortnite than spend time with her?", "NTA\n\nIf your gf planned on scheduling a day off so you two could do something, she should\u2019ve communicated that ahead of time. My rest days are sacred to me. Yeah, going out and doing something on your days off is fun if you planned it, but sometimes not having to plan anything all day, including meals, is so relaxing.", "definetly ESH. Me and my bf are both gamers and he often times wants his alone time. But we communicate that stuff. Waking up at 7am is awful but you ordered food twice without asking her if she wants anything? You both need to learn to communicate. Tell her you're having a pj day, it was already planned. She can then enjoy her day off. If you want alone time you will have it if you both keep not communicating like this", "NTA but you could have at least tried to go to a restaurant for dinner after resting all day. If you can afford to use Uber eats twice in a day it sounds like you could\u2019ve afforded to do that also.", "NTA, though I feel like it would be nice if you both told each other about your days off and asked each other if the other one wanted to hang out a day before the off one.", "YTA. You've shown your girlfriend where she rates in your top priorities and it's #3 after gaming and Ubering. Why do you consider being with her not resting and relaxing?", "Info: how often do you do this\n\nMy husband occasionally does the same thing, but it\u2019s a reasonable amount, if you\u2019re doing it all the time and not paying attention to your girlfriend then Y-T-A.

He wasn\u2019t at the club, the bar or his friend\u2019s house. He was home safe. Maybe next time girlfriend should tell him in advance. Not spring it up the day of.

This all could\u2019ve been avoided.", "*Find a GF to play Fortnite with?* /s\n\nNTA, My husband and I met on video games. Although we don't play the same, but there's enough overlap to enjoy gaming together. \nHowever please make it clear to GF you wanted to stay inside for a lazy day.

My pet peev is when my DH decides to stay home on my day off or one of the kids has the audacity to be sick and have to stay home on my day off - I\u2019m either super chill or ridiculously productive on my days off but whichever I decide to be, I like to do it without judgment and without anyone bugging me. These days off are random work days I plan in advance & tell my family about them, they are not weekend type regular days off.", "NTA\n\nYou had planned a day to relax and play your game, you shouldn't have to drop all that because your gf says so on a whim.

That's part of understanding his own needs.\n\nAlso, no part of \"not communicating\" indicates he doesn't like her - some people find communication difficult, and this case was triply difficult, because he reasonably didn't *know* what he was gonna do the entire day, and that his first communications were met with hostility and demeaning.\n\nAnd he's done nothing wrong before the day-of either. He had no reasonable expectation that his GF would do this.

His GF has to insert herself in every day off he has? Just because you're in a relationship, doesn't mean you don't deserve a day for yourself.", "What pattern we see one day. Your assuming all this. The girlfriend who demands op change his plans is ta. The passive agressive \u201c fuck what you want to do\u201d behavior is ridiculous and unhealthy. I hope op does leave this woman because it\u2019s clear that the only thing that matters are what she wants to do.", "[removed]", ">It doesn\u2019t change the fact that the gf didn\u2019t check with OP before taking the day off too. She heard he had a day off, decided to take one too AND decided that bf should just spend the day with her without asking him what he\u2019d like to do with his own day off\n\nExactly this. What if, this close to Xmas, op has decided to get Xmas pressies for his GF with his day off? \n\nThat is ruined by her having a surprise day off and expecting him to entertain her all day without conversing with him about it. \n\nOp is NTA. \n\nWe all need time to just be ourselves. Sometimes that's laying in bed past midday and playing games whilst ordering food.", "For me it doesn't even sound like she confronted him or even expected anything . Agree communication sucks but from both sides . As a grown man he could tell her that he wants to recharge ALONE . When you are in a relationship you don't need to do everything together but it is normal to expect it like when you tell me I want to relax like why can't we relax together ? watching anime etc together is not expecting anything from him extra just sharing time together . like I said it does depand what they do most of the time", "I call it a snow day. No winter weather required.", "I see your point, she \u201csurprised\u201d him by taking the same day off, she probably should\u2019ve told him, he probably had plans for the day which of course he did have.", "The problem is he didn't specify that 'rest and relax' meant 'play games all day' rather than relax with her. She was clearly still expecting to spend time together and OP just ignored that and left her hanging. All it would have taken was 5 minutes of him explaining what his plans for the day actually were.", "I totally agree with you!!", "If you think eating a meal with an SO is inserting themselves in your day off, I\u2019m not sure if living with someone is the right choice. You ca. have a day to yourself and still include your SO. \n\nMy guess is that this isn\u2019t about this day off only.", "the point is- he is the type of man who would order food for himself and not ask if she wanted anything- twice- it is very unlikely that he dedicates any time for her on other days either.\n\ni get 'waits for her to cook then counts eating dinner with her as quality time' vibes from him.", "And? Ita called self care. He took a day off to vwgetate and enjoy himself. Not to give into.his girlfriends whims and do whatever she wanted. \n\nI do this with my husband. I'll take a day off to just play video games. My past assignment I made that decision the night prior because I wasn't needed at work. I told my husband that I'm taking the day off to play video games. \n\nThis means I stayed in my pajamas and did nothing else. \n\nSo yeah, taking your time off to play video games and sleep is acceptable. The girlfriend is not entitled to making him change his plans because she decided to \"surprise\" him with her company.", "I get that you agree with her. I\u2019ve read this same response from you so many times in defence of what literally everyone else seems to see as quite clear.\n\nShe woke him\n\nHe said I\u2019m going back to bed\n\nHe woke and she asked again\n\nHe said I\u2019m going to relax\n\nHe started relaxing and gaming\n\nShe threw a tantrum that he didn\u2019t change his plans and do what she wanted.\n\nIt\u2019s really quite clear when you break it up into its logical steps.\n\nAgain, I get it, it just sounds to me that you would be her if this happened to you. But I still say you\u2019d be wrong for throwing a tantrum. He clearly said no. You\u2019re not entitled to your partners time because you made a surprise plan without telling him.\n\nGood intentions aside - she\u2019s got every day for the rest of their lives (potentially) to have another day. This one, is his.", "Name calling?

But like I said it depands how he spends his time otherwise . my guess is THE SAME . I doubt they are having date nights or doing fun stuff together", "Stating an opinion. Comment edited for clarity, so you don't have to write some god-awful blog about it.\nHave a good one.", "Yes communication would have helped like if she talked to him before taking the day off. But yes because once again we only care about her feelings. How would you feel if op barged in to her house and demanded to go do something on her day to relax.", "It doesn\u2019t matter that you made a little edit.
