I woke up at around 1 pm and my girlfriend asked me again if we could go somewhere and do something but I said I need to relax and rest. She was upset by this. When I went in my room to play Fortnite, she walked in and saw what I was doing, she just stared at me and said \u201creally\u201d and left. Then I got Uber eats to deliver me food and she got mad at that because she said we could have gone to the restaurant instead. I ordered dinner on Uber eats too and that\u2019s when she got mad, she started yelling and said she\u2019s never going to anything for me ever again. Aita?

Then she could have recovered her day off and gone to do something with a friend.   \n\n\nIt sounds like she kept waiting for you to be ready to hang out with her and go for dinner and you stuck yourself in a room and ordered food without her.", "ESH, neither of you are actually communicating needs and wants and neither of you is taking the other\u2019s needs  and wants into consideration. She should have discussed her wishes to spend time with you and you should have realized that she wanted to spend time with you and cut off the game for an hour or two to make her feel wanted and respected. But her getting mad and you ignoring your role in making her mad with neither of you discussing with each other is recipe for being single by Christmas.", "No judgement but both of you need to learn to communicate better. I have to say though, waking someone up at 7am on their day off is criminal behaviour.", "ESH, for the lack of communication. It's totally fine to want a day off to play video games, especially since your girlfriend gave you no heads up. And she shouldn't have yelled.\n\nBut, since you knew you wanted to do that, why not say so? You start off by telling her you want to sleep in. She lets you. As far as she's concerned, you'll sleep in, and then you both can go and do something - because all you've said is that you want a lie in. Then, she sees you playing video games, ordering food, etc. This is all totally fine imo, but why not say \"I planned to spend this day decompressing and playing games-- I love you but just need a day of solo downtime right now.\"", "NTA...\n\nI'm married to a gamer.  If we need a \"couples\" day then that gets communicated ahead of time.\n\nBoth of us have stressful jobs.  I decompress by reading books all day.  He decompresses by battling God knows what, on his computer.\n\nYour girlfriend should not have surprised you by taking off of work.  She should have planned a \"couples\" thing a day or two before so that the expectation would be set in that direction.\n\nSo, you're NTA, but you still need to make this right.  Plan a \"couples\" day together.  Make her feel special and discuss your decompression needs with her.  Listen as she discusses her own with you.", "[deleted]", "I get wanting to game and I get wanting to complete a goal, but you really could have taken a dinner break. That would have been a fine compromise. She would have gotten some time with you and you would still be able to reach your goal.", "NAH.\n\nYou need to communicate better. She made assumptions and took the day off, and she should have communicated that.

Don\u2019t be surprised if she leaves soon.", "Was going nta initially due to your gf surprising you, but the fact that you played all day and ordered uber eats (twice!) instead of getting some food with her is ridiculous. Totally TA.\nWhen you look back on life you won't remember the hours grinding on fortnite, you'll remember the time shared with the special people in your life though. Take a break mate, spend some time with her, then if you have to, go back and play the game.\nTo be honest you may actually have a video game addiction which is a very real issue, set some personal boundaries on gaming and stick to them, live your real life as well as your online one", "YTA because while, technically, you do deserve to have your day off and do whatever you want, you were an asshole for completely blowing off your girlfriend and not communicating your free day expectations to her.\n\nHaving a partner means commitment to another person. It means investing yourself in spending time with them. And yes, sometimes it means compromising, and from your post it sounded like you weren't open to that at all. Your girlfriend was mad because she was feeling like you're prioritizing a game over her, and she's right. If you'd rather prioritize a game over your relationship, don't be in one.\n\n[I'm not saying OP shouldn't play at all, just that if he wants a partner, he will also have to find the time for her, which, from his post it did not sound like he was doing.]", "ESH. \n\nShe should have communicated prior and you are entitled to rest, but why not split your time? Being in a relationship is about compromise. You could have played in the morning, then gone out for dinner/spent time with her in the evening. From her side of things, you see the game as more important than her and prioritising it over your relationship.", "NTA It was your day and she invited herself into it, and then tried to make it all about what she wants.

A lot of seemingly inexperienced people in this thread who don\u2019t know much about relationships.\n\nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re an introvert, which is why a day off for you is closing off to the world and playing a game. I\u2019m the same, and so is my fiance. We have to go out sometimes, but given the choice, we both sit at home, play games and recharge. We even have a joint gaming room. \n\nHere lies your problem - you\u2019re not compatible. If a day off for your girlfriend is a day out, she\u2019s more likely an extrovert, or at least a high functioning introvert. This means she recharges by doing things, meeting people. You are the opposite. You probably recharge by taking time to yourself and relaxing. The two of you are not compatible in any way.\n\nYou\u2019re the AH, not for what you did, but for not recognising you have different needs. She\u2019s the AH, not for wanting to go out, but for not recognising you have different needs. \n\nEnd it before you resent each others way of life, because neither of your ways of enjoying days off are wrong - they simply do not work together.\n\nEdit: spelling", "As an introvert if someone forced their way into my day off without letting me know they were going to be off too ahead of time I would be equally annoyed. However not asking if she wanted something when ordering food kinda sucked.", "ESH \n\nYes you get to do what you want on your day off. Yes she should have communicated better. But the moment you ordered takeout without even asking if she wanted anything you crossed a line.", "I'm going with ESH. She should have told you she planned to take the day off, but was it really hard to play for like half a day and then do something with her?", "Nta. She should've told you she was taking the day off. Sounds like you were having a rest day.", "NTA because she didn't make her expectations clear ahead of time but you might not have a gf for much longer if you ignore her.", "NTA because she didn\u2019t communicate with you and you don\u2019t really owe her anything just because she got certain ideas in her own head. I do think if this is a common thing though, you need to talk about it because it sounds like you may often prioritize gaming based on her reaction. And honestly, she might be close to leaving you.", "NTA not everyone likes \"surprises\" of going somewhere for entire day. Tbh sometimes that's also tiring. I fully understand your desire of a lazy day. Also just because you're couple doesn't mean you have to spend every free minute together. Me and my bf sometimes play together, other time alone or everyone with their friends. I don't get mad that for example he wants to spend evening playing with his buds because as i said he doesn't have to spend 100% of his time with me and he also have other people he want to talk with than just me. After all i have him for me most of the time \ud83d\ude1c", "NAH, but it looks like you guys aren\u2019t compatible. It\u2019s ok to want to kick back, play computer games and order takeaway to relax. It\u2019s also ok to want to get some fresh air, visit an attraction and go to a restaurant. Both sets of wishes need to be balanced. If that can\u2019t be done, better to end this sooner rather than later.", "NTA  \nShe didn't even try to communicate with you before hand and to me it sounds like she demanded you do stuff with her. \n\nI am 29 and a woman. I would be pissed if someone I was dating did this to me. \n\nCommunication is needed.   \n\"{Insert girlfriend name} Why did you not communicate with me before this morning that you wanted to do stuff together today? I already had plans. I am not even halfway though the full battle pass of my game and wanted to relax and play games today.\"  \n\n\nShe is not communicating. I just hit level 200 today to get all the battle pass items", "TA - I mean you could\u2019ve at least spoke to her, she tried to surprise you by taking a day off and you ignored her all day? Spending time with your gf should be relaxing and if you didn\u2019t go out for food you could\u2019ve at least cooked with her", "Info: did you communicate to her what you wanted to do with your day off at any point?", "ESH with a side of YTA. \nShe could've told you she took the day off, but playing Fortnite the whole day and ordering food because you want to reach a certain level sounds not just assholish, but like an addiction problem", "I tend to say YTA. Although you planned to take a whole day to play ur game (which is your right), you could have at least warned her that that\u2019s exactly how you want your day to be. \nNow she wanted to surprise you and that\u2019s a beautiful gesture. You could have at least acknowledge her effort and spend a meal together.", "Nta you specifically took a day off to stay home and relax doing nothing. That's it end of story, that's exactly what you did. Your gf taking an uncommunicated, unplanned day off doesn't mean she can just wake you up and dictate your entire day or any of it because she feels like it. You wanted a day off I'm assuming as a break from work and life, to just do nothing which I totally get and do sometimes.", "NTA, you planned this and wanted to relax. Your girlfriend didn't tell you ahead of time that she wants to spent time with you. I totally get you, some days you just want to stay home and play games/watch TV.", "ESH. She could have communicated better and in advance that she wanted to spend the day with you. But also you could have taken some time out of gaming to at least have a meal together.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is asking you to spend time with her because she has a need for connection. You shut her down. My husband spends a lot of time watching let\u2019s plays and playing video games in his free time, but when I tell him I need some of his attention, he sets what he is doing aside and gives it to me. There\u2019s nothing wrong with indulging your hobbies, but not at the expense of your relationships.", "You booked a day off. You planned to sleep in, then relax by doing your hobby. That sounds completely reasonable.\n\nShe decided to book the same day off that you had, and planned to go out together. That also sounds reasonable.\n\nBut the plans clashed, and both of you *completely failed* at communicating your respective plans to each other.\n\nAnswering strictly the question asked, no you are not T A for failing to completely drop your plans for the day to instead do exactly what she wanted to surprise you with, particularly given she \\*still\\* wasn't telling you what her plan was.\n\nBut ... this is definitely an ESH situation on the communications front. Both of you need to learn to talk to the other person what your plans are. I get communication is a bit difficult when woken up unexpectedly too early in the morning, but at least at the 1pm slot there should have been a discussion about what the plan for the day is.", "ESH. You are totally entitled to spend your day however you please, and yes she should have communicated beforehand what she wanted to do, and not woken you up. That was really rude and inconsiderate.\n\nBut, you knew she wanted go go somewhere. When you got up it would have been nice to give her a heads up that your plans were to game and not go anywhere all day. \n\nAlso did you just order a meal without asking her if she wanted any? Because that's rude IMO.", "NTA. My husband is an AVID gamer. It's his thing. On his days off, I know what his plans are. If I want to spend a day with him, I tell him in advance and we talk about it. I don't assume his time is my time. That's selfish. OP told her that he wanted to relax. Nothing more needs to be said imo. She got huffy cuz she wasn't getting her way. She sucks.", "NAH but you\u2019re just kinda a dick. you weren\u2019t excited to do anything with her?", "Info: are you sure you're 25? \n\nI'd understand maybe a 4-5 hour stint, but not to spend any time with her at all... are you sure you actually like her?", "YTA for not spending some time with her. Even if it was unplanned, that\u2019s part of the social contract. By being together you\u2019re agreeing to be there for each other and work with the other persons flaws (such as not planning appropriately). If you need to rush it you and her could\u2019ve gone out and eaten together in less than an hour. Instead, your actions told her you\u2019d rather play video games than spend any time at all with her", "NTA\n\nWhy is she forcing you to do stuff with her?\n\nWhy cant she do stuff with you instead?\n\nShe doesnt seem like she any respect for your day off\n\nGet rid of her", "YTA because you take your girlfriend for granted.

Have the decency to be a gentleman and treat your woman right.", "NTA..So basically you took a day off to chill and she decided to make the day about her.", "After some thought I'll say YTA\n\nShe should have communicated her plans for the day beforehand instead of surprising you. That's assholish on per part. But also why didn't you let her know as well? Do you guys not live together?\n\nShe made it known at 7am that she wanted to spend the day with you. You didn't tell her plans here either.\n\nYou woke up at 1pm and still would not communicate. \n\nYou ordered food for... you alone? I don't understand this part. Did you ask her what she wanted? How did you not talk to each other at this point either. \n\nIf your day does not involve her at all why not let her know she's wasting her time straight away? Sounded like you wanted a break from her as well.", "YTA. Even if you didn\u2019t want to go anywhere, why couldn\u2019t you at least compromise and tell your gf \u201cHey, I don\u2019t really want to leave the house today, but let\u2019s make some popcorn and watch a movie on the couch tonight?\u201d Or anything to that effect that clarified that you actually do want to spend time with her? Even if she hadn\u2019t gotten some time off, to me it\u2019s like basic social etiquette to limit your personal gaming time when you have an opportunity to spend some time with someone you supposedly like.\n\nA lot of comments here seem immature. You could have stopped playing anytime between 1 and whenever you went to bed for a few hours to do something with your gf. It sounds like you didn\u2019t even ask her if she wanted food! This isn\u2019t about going out or dramatically changing plans, this is about showing your gf you care about her. Your final line in your post shows your priorities. Your goals for a game seem more important than spending any time with her.", "nah here but im guessing you work alot so she took the same day off so you could spend time together but you decided that a game which can be played at anytime any place was more important then spending time with someone who took a day off to spend time with you ....  im guessing she will never do that again even if you ask... i hope she finds someone who loves her as much as you love your games console", "NTA. As in, she won't be the asshole when she leaves you for being deeply uninteresting. Do what you want man, but don't be surprised when she leaves you for someone who actually gives her a little attention and respect.", "YTA\n\nEven though your girlfriend took the day off of work to suprise you with possibly fun day/outing, you pretty much just blew her off rudely saying that you needed to rest. When she saw you playing Fortnite, she probably thought something like that you didn\u2019t want to go with her to play games instead. Instead of apologizing or something and trying to make it up to her, you went on Reddit to try and get validation for your actions. Even if you wanted to relax, is having a chill day with your girlfriend not relaxing? Seems like you just wanted an excuse to be lazy for the day and just play some video games.", "NTA if she wanted to surprise you I get that but then confirm first your plans. I don't agree with forcing your self on someones day off. Sometimes people want to stay home and nope out of life and that's alright.", "ESH, but you are bigger.  I'm introvert too.  Not gamer but I prefer  my books or movies or my mobile games.  I love weekends, when I can stay home and cuddle with my puppy.  I know I want not bf because I'm selfish with my time and I work from home but many time I'm still on my work laptop 8 pm.   But I have people who are important for me and I can change my plans for them, evenin lastminute. You have gf.  When you're in relationship,  you can't be selfish with your time,  or stay single.", "I'm gonna go with YTA here because it really sounds like there were numerous times during the day when you could have compromised a little to make her happy, but you consistently chose to ignore her very clear requests to spend time together. If I'm reading it right, you ordered food to the house twice? Why didn't you go out to dinner after she stated the first time that she would have liked to have gone out to the restaurant with you? You could have had your relaxing day in while sacrificing an hour or two to go out for food with her. Video games aren't more important than people, my guy.", "YTA, not for wanting to \u201crest and relax\u201d but for not communicating that that means to you \u201cspend the whole day alone playing Fortnite.\u201d\n\nHer surprise of a day off was unwelcome, sure. Waking you up at 7 sucks but she let you sleep in until 1PM.

AND THEN YOU DID IT AGAIN!\n\nDo you guys live together? Do your days off typically involve only \u201cresting\u201d alone? Do you pitch in around the house and do your part with chores? Do you even\u2026 LIKE your girlfriend?", "YTA. I get wanting to just chill on a day off. But the whole day? You couldn't stop to have lunch OR dinner with her? You'd rather game all day alone than spend even an hour or two with her? I'd have been pretty hurt too, that you preferred a game over her company for the whole day.\n\nI've been with my husband for 15 years, and I'd love a day off together, even if it were a surprise. (And I wonder if she asked if you had any plans for your day off, and you said no, just going to relax. Which she probably took to mean you were free and wouldn't mind relaxing with her. Aren't there any shows you two watch together? Couldn't you even pause for a meal and to check in with her? What if she wanted to connect with you about something, share some good / bad news with you, ask for your advice about something important? I mean, you didn't say she does this all the time, so what if she had an important reason? You didn't even ask.)\n\nYou were SO dismissive of her, even knowing she was there all day. You didn't seek her out once all day. You didn't accommodate her even one tiny bit. You didn't even say, oh, sorry, honey, I was really looking forward to just gaming all day and ordering takeout for myself.", "YTA. This was an everyone sucks situation due to poor or outright lack of communication. Once you ordered lunch without getting her lunch too then followed up doing the exact same for dinner, you became the full AH.\n\nYou wouldn't have even had to break to eat with her, but you should have eaten with her. You didn't even need to communicate with her to know she's not at work, it's lunch time/dinner time, and she'll want to eat something. Sure, you'd have to ask her what she wants, but dang that's a low bar for someone you call a girlfriend.", "I\u2019d be upset if someone woke me up early on my day off with a surprise. If they backed off and let me sleep until I woke up, no matter how late it was (in your case 1pm, 6 hours later) I\u2019d forgive them. \n\nAlmost every game has time sensitive aspects to keep you playing if you have no basic discipline or life. I turn off my game to spend time with my partner. He does the same for me.\n\nDo you want a girlfriend?\n\nEdit: YTA", "Both of you are aholes.

It's so annoying when every single day off they take the day too as surprise and commandeer your day off plans.", "NTA.

I won't have any time to hang out with you or eat with you\" He just said he wanted \"to relax.\"   \n\n\nSome people would reasonably  think that relaxing could be enjoying a meal with their partner or going for a walk. Hell, some people would like to go jogging and hiking or skeet shooting and call that relaxing.   \n\n\nThere is nothing wrong with a day dedicated to gaming and it would have been better if she let him know beforehand, but it's weird that he didn't even plan to eat with her and have the courtesy to let her know outright that he was not available.at.all.   \n\n\nI voted N T A already as people can spend time as they wish.

That is his prerogative, regardless of what my personal view of staying glued to a screen playing video games is. Doing mindless stuff like video games is for many a way of switching off and therefore important.   \nShe is not wrong in wanting to spend time with her SO, however, this does not automatically entitle her to his time, especially if she jumps on him without warning, wanting him to take her out. I find this borderline manipulative, especially with OP repeatedly stating that he just wants to relax. OP should of course make time for her on a pre-agreed day and then be free of distractions, fully focused so it can count as quality time.  \nShe needs to let him decompress the way he wants without turning it into a \"He loves video games more than me.\" Some growing up and improved communication needed here but NTA.", "Isn\u2019t a day off exactly that?
