Absolute NTA.  Your wife and kids are more important.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, depending on where you live, You legally can't let them move in. A small 2 bedroom apartment isn't okayed for the amount of people you're speaking about to all live there. \n\nAdd to the fact that your sister is easily a hazard and bad influence? Nah. It's likely her own fault they're homeless. Let your mom be the one to take them in. She's the one actually responsible for how your sister turned out. \n\nJust tell them that if they feel that way, then you don't need to be family and they can lose your number. You, and your real family, would be better off without that noise. \n\nYou're being a good husband and father by keeping her away. Don't let them break you down. They're all bad people.", "Definitely don't help her. She's a garbage person", "NTA.\n\nIf your grandma and siblings think you're so awful, why don't they take them in?", "NTA she is trying to force an extra 5 people inside a 2 bedroom apartment, I don't think that up to code and as you mentioned she also does drugs so its not good for the childrens health and especially baby!!", "NTA\n\n> in a small two bedroom apartment \n\nYOU DO NOT HAVE THE SPACE\n\n2 adults, 2 children and 1 infant are already a squeeze.\n\nAdding in 2 more adults and 3 kids - that would be 10 people in a 2br.\n\nAnd if you are renting, it may not be permitted according to the rental agreement which means you could be evicted.\n\nAdd on all the other issues - you are completely justified in telling her no, from her history of taking advantage of people to her drug use.\n\nBeing an older brother does not mean you have any responsibility to care for a young sibling, especially at the expense of the safety of your family.\n\nAll the people mad at you need to look in a damn mirror before going after you.", "NTA- You can't take them in, what are you going to do, sleep in shifts? Grandma, mum and sister can cram them into their properties if they think it's such an easy thing.", "NTA get a door security bar. they slip under your doorknob and wont damage the frame", "NTA - you have to take care of your kids first.", "NTA. You are married with kids. That means that the order of your responsibility is wife > kids > parents and siblings.\n\nYou need to ensure that your household is safe and sound first. Your responsibility is to your wife and kids before your siblings. Dont let your parents and siblings manipulate you into this by saying that \"you are the older brother\" you need to help. No. If you dont have the space then you dont have the space.", "As someone who has let a similar situation happen and it didn't go well.  No.  NTA.", "NTA", "NTA - they can stay with another relative (like your mum) if they think family has to put out with a life of misery.", ">in a small two bedroom apartment would cause nothing but trouble.\n\nIf you are renting yourself you'd likelu be violating your own lease by letting her move in. Many rentals have occupancy limits. 8 -9 people is too many for a rental. Don't do it. \n\nNTA.", " \"Since you are so concerned, I'll give her your address. When should I tell her you are expecting them all?\"", "Also consider the fact that child services could get involved.  If there's drug use in a 2 bedroom apartment,  and that many people crammed in, there will likely be drug use in front of the kids AND possibly drugs or paraphernalia left accessible to the kids. Don't risk losing your children to child services for the sake of faaaaaamily. This is another thing to bring up to all the nosy family members......they're welcome to invite that to their homes, but why should you have to?", "If she\u2019s doing drugs, you need to call child protective services. Bottom line. Any hate that you get, any negative treatment doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to the literal wellbeing of your nieces and nephews. Your wife and kids don\u2019t need to be exposed to that, and her kids also don\u2019t need to. If it\u2019s genuinely that bad, do the right thing. Don\u2019t be complicit.", "OP these *are* great points but please please do not make the mistake of laying them out to your sister or your nagging extended family. **No.** is a complete sentence.

Stick to your guns!!", "You're absolutely right, the only options would be for them all to pile in the living room or move my girls out of their room and let her and her kids stay there but that is a non-negotiable no. I would never make my kids give up their room just because she didn't have her priorities in order.", "That Is great advice and you are absolutely right, thank you so much!", "I used to work in multifamily housing. Tell them you could lose your own lease is you let them move in because it's the truth. That's too many people in an apartment that small.", "> do not make the mistake of laying them out to your sister or your nagging extended family.\n\nYes, saying anything more than \"NO\" will lead to what is known as JADE.  Even if you give the most logical reasons, the opponent will keep prodding \"Why?\", to try to get you to Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain your position until they create that one little hole in your reasoning that they can slip through."]}
