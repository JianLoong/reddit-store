That apartment is just right for you 4 - it will become disastrous with 9 people.  Plus, given how your sister is, there is a genuine fear that you will never be able to get her to move out (including legally), so I would try to avoid the situation entirely. \n\nIf your parents and your relatives are so concerned - they can put their money where their mouth is and either put her up in their homes or pay for a place for her to stay. If they cannot do that, it\u2019s time to shut up (or at least you to filter out all that noise).", "NTA\n\nYou physically do not have the space. You cannot have that many people in a 2 bedroom set up, and renting, you definitely risk eviction for that many people. No way would that ever be kosher on a lease. There's legal issues to having so many people in such a small space. With kids, you're looking at potential CPS issues, as well.\n\nDon't light yourself on fire to keep others warm.\n\nNext relative who calls, ask why they aren't stepping up, especially if they have a bigger living space", "WYBTAH? Perhaps.

And given her drug use, social services could easily get involved. You don't want to do this to your family.\n\nAs far as grandma, mom, and your sister are concerned, any one of them is free to take her, her children, and the boyfriend in. NTA.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "NTA", "NTA.  You already have 4 people in a two bedroom apartment.  You don\u2019t have the room.  Grandma, mom and sister can take them in.", "NTA. Just so you know, that\u2019s not gonna work for us. No explanation is necessary since they should understand already that there isn\u2019t much room for them in your place and your wife is pregnant. And just keep repeating. I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s not going to work for us.", "NTA!  If you take them in, you'll regret it within days, and the likelihood of getting them to leave is minimal.   Tell your mom, sister, and grandmother to take them in.", "NTA, but if no one else in your family ends up taking them in, you could always just take the kids and leave the adults to their own problems, that is of course if you feel like you could handle it as it would be a lot", "NTA   She's made this bed for herself.  You don't have the space for them and her addiction is a problem she needs to resolved.  Maybe you could house just the kids for a little bit if it's that desperate, but her and the bf are no goes.  If the rest of the family feels that strongly about it they need to open their doors.  Otherwise, you can tell them to stuff it.", "If she\u2019s doing drugs it\u2019s a no for me dog.", "NTA. You have to put your own family first \u2014 your wife and your kids. Letting your sister and her booyfriend and her brood move into your 2br apartment would create a toxic living situation for your entire family.\n\nYour grandma, mom and sister can take her in if they think it's so important that someone bail her out.

No way I would let her live with me. The only reason your grandma, mom, and sister all calling you AH is because they are next in line to be asked for accommodation.", "NTA. Listen bro as a man you have to take care of your household. You have no business putting your lease, you kids, not your wife in jeopardy because somebody told you to. If they are so adamant about getting your sister (who is grown and is responsible for her self) somewhere to stay then they should do it themselves. You got your own stuff to deal with and simply don't have the facilities for the bs. Respectfully.", "NTA- even if she\u2019s family that\u2019s not your responsibility to be her safety net. She needs to quit buying drugs and use that money to pay rent. She gots kids yet she chooses to do drugs. Talk about irresponsible. But yea OP. That\u2019s not your fault and besides your living quarters only have so much room. Keep on keeping on, and let them figure it out themselves.", "NTA 3 kids in a small 2-bed apartment is already cramped as hell. Never mind all the justifications of why not, you\u2019d be the arsehole if you said yes.", "NTA, as someone that housed a pathological liar and a drug addict in that past it was one of the worst situations I had ever been in and getting him out of my house and my life took months. You have to protect your own family first.", "NTA. If your family is so concerned one of them can take her & her family in.", "NTA. My brother is an addict, narcissistic and manipulative. He is toxic. \nYour sister will always have these issues unless she gets clean and completely changes her life.\nDon\u2019t enable the behavior.\nShe is a grown up and needs to get help and fix her life.

Don't they have more space and less kids in their home? Aren't they even more responsible for sister, being her parents and all? Grandma is so concerned, then why can't she help with the kids?\n\n\"Sorry, we don't have the ability to help right now\" and never say another word", "ExActly", "CPS is not always the answer. We do not know enough about this situation to jump to that conclusion. You know nothing about her drug use (what kind, how often, or if it actually puts her kids in a situation where they cannot be cared for). It is possible for people to use drugs responsibly (not sure that\u2019s the case here but OP doesn\u2019t seem concerned about the safety of her children). Sure, sometimes it\u2019s absolutely necessary to intervene- but the foster care system is shit and often puts children in even worse situations. If there is a concern about the sisters ability to take care of her children and there is other family available to take them in while the mother does what she needs to do to take care of herself, that is almost always a better option. \n\nThat said - I agree OP should feel no obligation to let them stay there and if the mom/sister are able to help they should step up.", "Why doesn't the boyfriend get a job and support her!", "Blame it on your lease.

They can't bring in 5 more people without the ok from their landlord.", "I think it would be 4, because it would be OP and his wife plus his sister and then OP mentioned her boyfriend, too. \n\nHard pass from me.", "Four adults, the drug user has a boyfriend as well.", "Yep not to mention currently 5, soon to be 6 kids with OPs wife being pregnant. 9 soon to be 10 people in a small 2 bedroom ~~house~~ apartment is way too much to deal with."]}
