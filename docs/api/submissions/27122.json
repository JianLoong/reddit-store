You train wasn't packed so it wasn't that bad, but still I get people getting angry. You could've tried to fit your bags under the seats or smth. Or get an extra ticket for the seat you've taken, as long as you payed for it, doesn't matter if you sit in it or have you bag take it.\n\n\nBut the man is a clear A H.

Don't block SEATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its that simple. I don't care what your reasoning is. That seat is for someone to sit on not to block.

I appreciate your response.\n\nIn his rant he mentioned that everyone paid for \u201cA\u201d (singular) seat and that I was taking up 2. I do see his point, but didn\u2019t feel like ITA until he mentioned it.", "Appreciate you responding! \n\nSolid advice. I was pretty heated when the initial shock wore off, but you\u2019re totally right; physical confrontation might also be what they\u2019re after.", "Thanks for the reply! \n\nYes, the execution was off on his part and that\u2019s what had me questioning my position as TA. There were people standing despite other open seats, that may have been what triggered him, but who knows.", "Thank you for your reply and feedback!", "Insane take.\n\nFirstly, as long as there\u2019s enough available seating, there\u2019s absolutely zero wrong with using more than one seat for whatever reason, comfort or logistics or whatever. Why would that be an issue as long as you\u2019re not forcing anyone to stand? Literally where is the harm? \n\nIf one is traveling with luggage by train/public transportation, which you are absolutely allowed to do, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it if there is no designated luggage space. To suggest people pay for an additional seat because they\u2019re traveling with luggage is insane to me. \nTrains usually have designated areas for luggage for precisely this reason. And if it doesn\u2019t, people have to make due with the space that is available. \n\nNTA in the slightest.", "Thank you for your reply! And yes, I agree and can also find it frustrating at times if others are taking a seat with a bag.", "nta, blocking seats when there are plenty is okay. blocking seats when there is limited avalibilty or you are blocking ones near the door that less mobile people might need, even if they are not priority is not okay. \n\nthe guy was being an ass, travelling like that with a lot of bags is a irregular occurance. it is an obvious extra need. it is completely different to those people who put a single hand bag on the seat. \n\n I suppose letting a small child sit in a seat they haven't paid for instead of on their parents lap is also never okay? \n\npeople sometimes have extra needs, it is better that people use common sense. and maybe some compassion dare I say.", "Thanks for the response! \n\nAnd probably, he seemed to have that sort of energy.", "Appreciate the reply! \n\nAnd no doubt! I just wanted to see if this was a big offence of sorts as it seemed to prompt such an explosive response from what seemed to be a seasoned train user.", "I appreciate you taking the time responding! \n\nThat\u2019s why I was curious to post here; maybe there was another action I should have taken that I\u2019m oblivious to?", "Appreciate your response and feedback, thank you!", "Thank you for your reply!  \n\nPerhaps I should add the detail to my post that it\u2019s also open seating (non-reserved).", "Appreciate your response! And sorry that you had to face that. \n\nThe aisle feels a lot less appropriate and seems to pose more of an inconvenience/hazard. Maybe we ran into the same person!", "Bro, there where other seats available. It's not like the train was packed and where else should she put them? In the aile so everyone's way is blocked or what? She did nothing wrong.", "Where did he want the bags to be put? On top of your head? Did he want to carry a suitcase himself so that there would be enough room?\n\nHe\u2019s being a jerk. 7 in the morning is too early to be being a jerk. Don\u2019t let it get to you OP.", "I understand trying to save money on vacay costs, but it's inconsiderate to take multiple suitcases on public transit at RUSH HOUR. You are in the way and taking too much space when people are just trying to get to work.\n\nEither take less stuff, travel at non peak hours or spring for a cab. \n\nYta. Most won't say anything (me included) but many will be silently cursing you.", "NTA as long as no one needed it which wax the case", "I sometimes also prefer to stand instead of squeezing in between people and sitting down, just to get back up 5 minutes later again.\n\nPeople may also simply ask you if you could move your bag away (if there is space) if they desire to sit.", "You know you can make a judgement as a separate post, righ?", "he was the a. you must have clearly had a lot of bags. it is not the same crime as sticking a handbag on a seat. I always find there is never enough luggage space for larger bags. people should be more understanding that sometimes people need different things. \n\ni could also be considered a seasoned train user.", "Not necessary. You did nothing wrong- if train personnel doesn\u2019t ask you to remove your belongings, the loud mouth is out of place. I\u2019m biased because I did something similar- my suitcase wouldn\u2019t fit the overhead rack and I moved from my reserved seat to a space that accommodated my stuff and I- 10 minutes later 2 people sat in my reserved seat. When the conductor came by- I got his attention and approval. \ud83d\ude0a", "Hahaha maybe. Also on their original comment, why do they think being rude will help?

And totally, 7AM is surely to early for that attitude!", "Thanks for the reply! I appreciate your understanding about cost, and I do see your point about getting in the way. It was definitely something we waffled over which is why we took an earlier train which is a lot less busy than the 8AM trains. \n\nTypically I\u2019d have a friend or family drive, but just due to the timing there was no way I was about to ask anyone to do a 4hr round trip in rush hour versus the 35-40min train ride. I\u2019ll be home on a weekend luckily, and will be certainly calling a friend and taking them for beers!", "Thanks for the reply!\n\nAnd certainly, if someone did need one or asked to have that particular seat, I would\u2019ve been happy to try and accommodate.", "Very true, I\u2019m the same when I don\u2019t have luggage with me. \n\nThanks for the reply!", "i could but I was also responding to you. which is what people do here.", "Thank you for your reply! \n\nIt was enough bags that I was clearly travelling somewhere, but not so many that I thought anyone would be offended. I appreciate your perspective as a seasoned train user! Upon reading most comments here, I think it may have been the case if someone having a bad day.", "Very true, and that definitely makes me think they\u2019re just an A. \n\nAsking nicely goes a long way, and becomes much more of a teachable moment if someone is truly in the wrong.", "Stop feeling bad  what he said is the opposite of the safety rules EVERYWHERE.  It is ALWAYS recommended to leave the aisles and corridors free to be able to evacuate in case of emergency . he's an ah on top of s....", "Thanks for the response! \n\nIt reminded me of being a kid when they drilled into us not to have bags in the aisles.", "Exactly"]}
