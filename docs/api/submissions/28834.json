Originally it was supposed to be back in march, but due to our cat getting extremely sick, we used all of our wedding fund to pay for his expenses, and also because my mother and her side of the family begged us to keep our wedding local. We were suppose to get married in Florida in a DIY style because we already live pay check to pay check and this was a cheaper option for both of us-  because Weddings in NY are extremely expensive for \u201call inclusive\u201d packages. The traveling was a \u201cproblem\u201d for people as my mother put it, so we changed it up and decided to do a smaller wedding at home.. \n\nNow that our invites are coming back, I\u2019m realizing that my mother, who had offered to take care of them for me because I knew she had a lot of the addresses already written down from the engagement party she threw for me- had invited my sister, which is fine, but I have my nephews that would have to come with her. I also haven\u2019t spoken to this sister in THREE YEARS, because of her toxic fiance. I didn\u2019t ask her to be a bridesmaid either because like I said, I haven\u2019t spoken to her in three years and she was invited to my engagement party, told my mother she would be there, only for her fiance to switch it up and say they weren\u2019t going.\n\nI love my nephews, but I do not want children there when I get married. \n\nI understand why my mother would want them there, she never gets to see them because my \u2018BIL\u2019 likes to make up reasons to not drive down or let her go up there to seem her grand babies. She just wants all her kids and grandkids together in one place. She just wants it to be a big beautiful celebration which she does deserve.\n\nThough yesterday, my mother blew up on me because I had to remind her that no, there will be no children at my wedding. She offered to pay for them, and I had to have my fianc\u00e9 put his foot down because I was so ready to give in.\n\nShe belittled him, told him it wasn\u2019t her fault that his side of the family was so small and that mine is full of children. ( I have more nieces and nephews, but my brothers are flying in from Florida, and said they could just come up themselves.) and that he was being disrespectful for telling her that she was being inconsiderate of him and myself and our wishes. \n\nShe pretty much told me to have a good life, and that she won\u2019t be coming to my wedding because I don\u2019t want my nephews there. Now I\u2019m scared because I know my younger sister will get involved and possibly leave as well for the same reason. My father and Step mother have been the only reasonable people in my life and told me I did the right thing by sticking by what I want, but it\u2019s hard because it\u2019s my mother and I love her.", "created_utc": 1697206589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176zrt4/aita_for_telling_my_mother_no_kids_at_my_wedding/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am so sorry you have this added stress right before your wedding.  It's your & your fianc\u00e9e's choice to have a child-free wedding; it's not up to your mom.  Your mom has drawn the line in the sand; it is up to you to decide what you want more-a child-free wedding or your mother/younger sister to attend.  I'm petty, and hate when people try to force my hand, so I would stick to the child-free wedding.  But ultimately, it's up to you what you prefer.  You have your dad & stepmom in your corner; will that be enough?  I wish you luck and congratulations on your upcoming wedding!", "NTA \n\nNever give in to emotional terrorists.

Being a Family person does NOT mean the people in your family get to choose how you live your life and vise versa. Your mom is your mom but that does not mean she is allowed to use your wedding as a means to see the rest of the family, ie the grand kids. \n\nI get that your sisters partner is toxic, but thats not on you to worry about. Your wedding is not a family reunion, it is your wedding. \n\nYour an adult, your allowed to have boundaries. And this guilt your feeling? Comes from a toxic place.

If your mom wants to play like this she can do it alone.", "NTA. And you're not selfish.  This is a wedding, not a playground.  This is YOUR wedding. If your mom wants a family reunion, she can throw and pay for one herself.  I find it interesting you  state that this is your mother and you love her, but I don't hear her doing the same. She's putting her wants ahead of you on your day. She's putting your sister's wants ahead of yours on your day.\n\nWhy would you want a bunch of little kids, who you say are disrupters, causing problems on a day that's supposed to be about you and your fianc\u00e9? If you give in, you will regret it forever. You will wonder why you gave in, why you let yourself be miserable for people you didn't talk to, people who spent all their time yelling at their kids (or worse, not even trying to control them), why you let these kids make the rest of your guests miserable - all so your mom is happy and no one else is?  The only one being selfish here is your mom.", "NTA\n\nYou need to call your mother out for this.

If she chooses to continue to try to manipulate you into altering your wedding up to the point of not coming all she is doing is ruining your relationship. She still won't see the grandchildren, the baby daddy will still be a problem, and she'll have missed one of the most important days of your life. \n\nMake it clear her only options are to permanently drop this and apologize to your fianc\u00e9 or permanently damage her relationship with you. There is no work around. There will zero concessions or changes to your wedding plans. \n\nYou need to be an adult about this and set clear, definitive boundaries. Don't go into your marriage putting your mother's wants above you and your partner's joint decisions and don't allow anyone to verbally abuse him the way your mother has. \n\nBe an adult.

The venue has a family of foxes and we\u2019re getting married outside- so I\u2019m keeping him and his little brother home to be safe.", "They\u2019re been together for years, like nearly 15 or so, we\u2019re helped her move out at least four times since then only for her to come crawling back. I\u2019ve also got into altercation with him one of the times and helped her move four hours back to NY with me after only to have him drive her back because she wanted to.\n\nSome people you can offer an escape and they will take it or they won\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried, my mother has tried, my other sister has tried, my aunts have too- so please don\u2019t assume we haven\u2019t tried to help her out of a situation.", "I definitely do not think OP is TA just because she didn\u2019t do the invites. Her mom knew what she wanted (based on other comments from OP, her mother knew no kids). If you\u2019ve never planned a wedding before, it is A-LOT of work and to have someone take something off your plate is a HUGE help. OP trusted her mother to follow thru with her wishes and her mom clearly took advantage.", "Because my mother had asked me if everyone on her list for my engagement party, was who I wanted to go ( she asked me for them for their invites, like a list of people we were inviting.) and took it upon herself to squeeze in the kids after telling her no kids multiple times. \n\nShe offered to handle the invites since I was dealing with everything else, and she\u2019s my mother- so yeah I\u2019m gonna ask her for help if she offered lmao.", "We\u2019re each others spines when it comes to each others parents.", "I get over simulated with children, and honestly if I allowed my sister to bring her kids my cousins would want theirs, and so forth. I\u2019ve been to weddings with children and it just seems like a lot for me to handle. I\u2019m already anxious as it is, and crying children just make it worse for me.", "She could hire a sitter for the couple hours, but she won\u2019t because she\u2019s stubborn.", "Listen, I\u2019m not a family person, but from where I\u2019m standing you have changed SO MUCH about your wedding to accommodate what your mom wants. \n\nLocation, size, who is invited\u2026 at some point you need to say *this is MY wedding*. \n\nI don\u2019t know your family dynamic, but are you a family person or are you the person conditioned to bend over and take it (or give it up) because otherwise your mom goes nuclear (as she has here)? My mom is a family person and is also her family scapegoat and she has taken DECADES of abuse (from her siblings) to hold onto her \u201cfamily\u201d person dream much to my and my sisters frustration. Don\u2019t be my mom. Sometimes the Family person at the center of focus needs to be you, and your wedding is definitely that time. (BTW the way my family treats my mom and me by extension is why I\u2019m NOT family oriented.)\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d contact your mom and say something like: Mom, I have bent over backwards to accommodate what you want in my wedding, you changed my location, you manipulated the invitation list, <insert anything else> and I\u2019ve been willing to assist because that\u2019s what family does. But this IS my wedding, and the one thing I\u2019m not willing to fold on is it being childfree. I\u2019m happy to help see if we can find a babysitter for nephews so you can see them and my wedding can be childfree, but they are NOT COMING to the wedding. If your response to me wanting to have control over ONE aspect of my wedding is to choose not to intend then I will take that as guidance on how you\u2019d like our relationship to go from now on and will be making more space between us because I don\u2019t want to invest my time and energy in someone willing to hurt me on the most important day in my life so they can get what they want. Let me know when you are ready to talk about it.\u201d\n\nNTA. But your mom really is.", "Forego the drama - make yourself calm and accept that if she chooses not to come, and sis decides not too as well, tell them you will miss them - but it's their choice to be there or not. No kids - that's final.", "[deleted]", "Is excluding your nephews worth all this? Are they that bad? Just wondering, not to judge..", "At my sisters wedding, there were no children allowed. She actually did let my nieces and nephews come as ring, bearers and flower girls, but that was her decision. If you don\u2019t want any children at all, not a problem. It is your wedding. And I feel like those are becoming more popular.", "and again it is not your fault celebrate all that show up or can come and thank those that couldn't make it due to their circumstances. for the ones trying to high jack your day fuck them. it's not about them it is your day and your fiance's day.", "Maybe your sister found someone like your mother because she doesn\u2019t know any different. Irrespective, your mother is absolutely a toxic AH in her own right. She literally threw the most hurtful thing she could at him because she wasn\u2019t getting her own way", "If you allow your mother an inch now you are being incredibly disrespectful to the man who stood up for you when you couldn\u2019t and was made to feel like shit in return. It\u2019s no longer just about you, support your husband to be and show him you won\u2019t allow toxic family to treat him like that. Frankly her invite would have been revoked if it was me, just in case she tried to change her mind.", "Btw i want to apologize if i came off rude. \n\nIm a Mom, so i get emotional when I read these stories. \n\nYou deserve a happy wedding my dear. You deserve to have the life you want for yourself. Your mom is acting like a child, and thats sad. But its also not your problem to solve. \nAlso, give yourself some grace. Yes you need to gain some confidence. But id be lying if I said I have a solid spine myself with all things. \n\nYour learning, your growing and with time it will be easier to make these decisions. Itll be easier to pur your foot down and keep it there. \n\nIm glad you have fiance & dad in your corner. Sounds to me like Dad knows exactly what kind of stuff your mom is capable of. Glad hes on your team. Also, congratulations!! \n\nAll this chaos aside i hope you have the night of your life \ud83e\udd70", "> I\u2019ve seen enough \u201ccute\u201d moments at weddings through videos to not want them there for my own anxiety\n\nYou may want to consider with all the drama going on - just elope at the courthouse and have a party for your mom later.", "Wow yeah, NTA.", "Then I vote NTA", "Disregard this person. Your wedding is not an opportunity for grandma to sneak a visit in.", "Has he allowed his family to disrespect you without consequences while you were acting as his spine? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing to him", "That was you. This is them.\n\nThe wedding is \"supposed\" to be whatever the bride and groom want it to be. Rugrats from an estranged sister can be invited to a picnic or something in the future.", "Oh no you didn\u2019t come off as rude at all!! I\u2019ve been pushed around a lot growing up because of a lack of spine, and my weakness is my loved ones- which doesn\u2019t mean they get a free pass to push me around.\n\nI really appreciate what you said, and what everyone has been saying! Everyone has really helped me open my eyes to how she\u2019s acting and that I need to stand by my choice. \n\nAnd thank you!! I\u2019m excited to be marrying my best friend!", "I would totally do it, but our wedding is pretty much totally paid in full! I\u2019m at the point where if she doesn\u2019t show then she can live with it you know?", "What are you talking about? I didn\u2019t have room to add but I told her what she said was extremely disrespectful to him and that he should apologize during the confrontation.", "Oh, I totally agree.  They should have the wedding they want.  \n\nI was just letting her know how it went for me and why I decided to let kids come, because I always thought I would have a child free wedding but then changed my mind when I actually had a wedding.  A different perspective.  But I 100% think people should have the wedding they want and not be bullied into anything else.", "I hear you. I only hope that's the option they take instead of crashing with those kids.", "You never said a word about standing up for him and have been clear you cave under the family pressure so it wasn\u2019t hard to believe you hadn\u2019t backed him up. I\u2019m glad you did but if you end up changing your wedding to appease her after she did that negates any apologies you asked for.", "I didn\u2019t have room in my statement to do so. I do cave under family pressure and he was being an amazing spouse by helping me build a spine for myself. I\u2019m not changing my wedding for her, and I wasn\u2019t planning on it. I simply wanted to know if what I did made me an asshole."]}
