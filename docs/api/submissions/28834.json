Originally it was supposed to be back in march, but due to our cat getting extremely sick, we used all of our wedding fund to pay for his expenses, and also because my mother and her side of the family begged us to keep our wedding local. We were suppose to get married in Florida in a DIY style because we already live pay check to pay check and this was a cheaper option for both of us-  because Weddings in NY are extremely expensive for \u201call inclusive\u201d packages. The traveling was a \u201cproblem\u201d for people as my mother put it, so we changed it up and decided to do a smaller wedding at home.. \n\nNow that our invites are coming back, I\u2019m realizing that my mother, who had offered to take care of them for me because I knew she had a lot of the addresses already written down from the engagement party she threw for me- had invited my sister, which is fine, but I have my nephews that would have to come with her. I also haven\u2019t spoken to this sister in THREE YEARS, because of her toxic fiance. I didn\u2019t ask her to be a bridesmaid either because like I said, I haven\u2019t spoken to her in three years and she was invited to my engagement party, told my mother she would be there, only for her fiance to switch it up and say they weren\u2019t going.\n\nI love my nephews, but I do not want children there when I get married. \n\nI understand why my mother would want them there, she never gets to see them because my \u2018BIL\u2019 likes to make up reasons to not drive down or let her go up there to seem her grand babies. She just wants all her kids and grandkids together in one place. She just wants it to be a big beautiful celebration which she does deserve.\n\nThough yesterday, my mother blew up on me because I had to remind her that no, there will be no children at my wedding. She offered to pay for them, and I had to have my fianc\u00e9 put his foot down because I was so ready to give in.\n\nShe belittled him, told him it wasn\u2019t her fault that his side of the family was so small and that mine is full of children. ( I have more nieces and nephews, but my brothers are flying in from Florida, and said they could just come up themselves.) and that he was being disrespectful for telling her that she was being inconsiderate of him and myself and our wishes. \n\nShe pretty much told me to have a good life, and that she won\u2019t be coming to my wedding because I don\u2019t want my nephews there. Now I\u2019m scared because I know my younger sister will get involved and possibly leave as well for the same reason. My father and Step mother have been the only reasonable people in my life and told me I did the right thing by sticking by what I want, but it\u2019s hard because it\u2019s my mother and I love her.", "created_utc": 1697206589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176zrt4/aita_for_telling_my_mother_no_kids_at_my_wedding/", "score": 508, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am so sorry you have this added stress right before your wedding.  It's your & your fianc\u00e9e's choice to have a child-free wedding; it's not up to your mom.  Your mom has drawn the line in the sand; it is up to you to decide what you want more-a child-free wedding or your mother/younger sister to attend.  I'm petty, and hate when people try to force my hand, so I would stick to the child-free wedding.  But ultimately, it's up to you what you prefer.  You have your dad & stepmom in your corner; will that be enough?  I wish you luck and congratulations on your upcoming wedding!", "NTA \n\nNever give in to emotional terrorists.

Being a Family person does NOT mean the people in your family get to choose how you live your life and vise versa. Your mom is your mom but that does not mean she is allowed to use your wedding as a means to see the rest of the family, ie the grand kids. \n\nI get that your sisters partner is toxic, but thats not on you to worry about. Your wedding is not a family reunion, it is your wedding. \n\nYour an adult, your allowed to have boundaries. And this guilt your feeling? Comes from a toxic place.

If your mom wants to play like this she can do it alone.", "NTA. And you're not selfish.  This is a wedding, not a playground.  This is YOUR wedding. If your mom wants a family reunion, she can throw and pay for one herself.  I find it interesting you  state that this is your mother and you love her, but I don't hear her doing the same. She's putting her wants ahead of you on your day. She's putting your sister's wants ahead of yours on your day.\n\nWhy would you want a bunch of little kids, who you say are disrupters, causing problems on a day that's supposed to be about you and your fianc\u00e9? If you give in, you will regret it forever. You will wonder why you gave in, why you let yourself be miserable for people you didn't talk to, people who spent all their time yelling at their kids (or worse, not even trying to control them), why you let these kids make the rest of your guests miserable - all so your mom is happy and no one else is?  The only one being selfish here is your mom.", "NTA\n\nYou need to call your mother out for this.

If she chooses to continue to try to manipulate you into altering your wedding up to the point of not coming all she is doing is ruining your relationship. She still won't see the grandchildren, the baby daddy will still be a problem, and she'll have missed one of the most important days of your life. \n\nMake it clear her only options are to permanently drop this and apologize to your fianc\u00e9 or permanently damage her relationship with you. There is no work around. There will zero concessions or changes to your wedding plans. \n\nYou need to be an adult about this and set clear, definitive boundaries. Don't go into your marriage putting your mother's wants above you and your partner's joint decisions and don't allow anyone to verbally abuse him the way your mother has. \n\nBe an adult.

It's not like they don't have time to find a babysitter.", "Nta i am wondering if there\u2019s reasons why your bil makes excuses to keep them away from her.", "If your family leaves your wedding because the things THEY want aren't happening,  they don't deserve to come. It is literally about you and your partner joining together. No part of the of the tradition states that your family's kids need to be there, and beyond that, who gives a fuck because it's your wedding you 2 are paying for. Fuck all that drama and noise.", "NTA for what was asked. Y-T-A for making your fianc\u00e9 do your dirty work.  He deserves better.  Learn to stand up for yourself and your fianc\u00e9.  If you can\u2019t do that, you shouldn\u2019t be getting married.", "So why don't you talk to your sister? Why doesn't your mom visit her daughter and grandkids? Why is your family abandoning your sister. Is it because of her toxic fiancee? I would not cut her off. I would just ignore him. No matter what he says. Unless he becomes threatening or violent. As for the wedding is it possible to hire a sitter for the kids to stay at grandmas during the wedding so sister can come? Would this appease your mom?", "Nta. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve already done so much to follow your mothers wishes for your own wedding and now she\u2019s being cruel and hateful to you and your fianc\u00e9 the moment you don\u2019t do as she says", "NTA - your wedding, your rules. I don\u2019t get why people get so bent out of shape over this. Some people don\u2019t like kids and / or don\u2019t want them around for certain events. Get over it", "It\u2019s your wedding, not a family reunion.  Call her bluff\u2014if she doesn\u2019t come, that\u2019s on her.  NTA", "lol. It ain\u2019t the home stretch, it\u2019s the pre game show.", " NTA\n\nAnd now that you mom is not going to, just fly to Florida and get married there just as you wanted", "NTA. My mom was slightly upset (but thankfully quickly got over it) when I wouldn\u2019t extend invitations to her friends to my second wedding. I refused to let this one be some kind of weird friend and family reunion for her like I did my first. Your wedding is your wedding, you get to make the rules. It\u2019s sucks that the relationship with your sis and her fianc\u00e9 is crappy, but your wedding shouldn\u2019t be the only time so try to remedy this.", "NTA - I'm very sorry your mom is being like that, but she is the one being an asshole.", "This kind of bs is exactly why a simple courthouse wedding is often the best way to handle marriage. Celebrate with a later party that the bride and groom can afford and only invite your closest friends and family that can support you. No, you are NTA for saying \u201cno\u201d to your mother. You should have insisted on keeping the wedding where and how you wanted it. It is not too late to change your mind and let your mother go pound sand.", "And your mother just used your love against you. Think about that.", "You're' doing the right thing, stand your ground. You know what you want, so make sure you have it your way. Don't let them bully you into anything you don't want. Not having kids at your wedding is pretty reasonable. Your mother will come, she's just trying to blackmail you. NTA", "I haven\u2019t spoken to her in three years, I could try to, but honestly if I do that might open up another can of worms.", "There is a good chance that BIL won't let them go to the wedding either anyway. He sounds awful.", "NTA It's your wedding. Full stop. You're not being unreasonable by not inviting kids. Lots of people don't invite kids to weddings. \n\nSo with that in mind, this anecdote is *not* meant to sway your decision in any way. I just found it coincidntal so I'm sharing:\n\nAt the time that I got married there were only three young kids in our extended family so I said \"bring 'em!\". My cousin's baby kept making little squeaking and cooing noises during the ceremony. I was extremely anxious at the time and I actually found it really grounding to have a break in the silence. I kept thinking \"There's a little baby here, this can't be scary if a baby's here\". \n\nThen we did a second wedding in my husband's home country where I had to repeat vows in a language I barely speak and I wasn't nervous at all...go figure.", "It sounds like you value your mom a lot. \n\nUnfortunately it sounds like your mom doesn't value you in the same way. \n\nShe's made it clear to you that seeing her grandkids is more important than seeing her daughter's wedding. \n\nAnd *that's* who you want to change your wedding for? You want to put yourself in an uncomfortable situation *at your own wedding* for a woman who clearly doesn't prioritize you? \n\nYou deserve better. And your fiance sure as hell deserves better than you bending over backward for someone who is as rude to him as she is. It sounds like she's treated him as poorly as she's treated you, and you just accept that. You're OK with your mother belittling your partner. That's pretty awful. And now you want to change something important about your wedding for *her*? Damn, girl.  \n\nYou're getting married. Your priority should NOT be your mother, *especially* because it is uncomfortably clear that your mom doesn't value you nearly as much as you value her.  \n\nIf she truly valued you (or your comfort) as highly as you value her, *none* of this would be happening. She'd be supporting you and your fiance, because she'd agree that the day is yours and should be about you and making you feel great.\n\nInstead she's telling you that her own wishes are more important than yours, even on your wedding day, and the saddest part of all is that you're inclined to agree with her. \n\nThis whole situation is honestly just so sad, because you're willing to give up so much for someone who'd never do the same for you. \n\nShe thinks her wishes are so much more important than yours. Please, *please* \\- stop believing her. You *cannot* keep going through life this way."]}
