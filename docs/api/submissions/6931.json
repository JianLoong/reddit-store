{"id": 6931, "submission_id": "107quny", "title": "AITA for refusing to get rid of my peanuts even though my roommate\u2019s boyfriend is allergic?", "selftext": "I (21 F) live with \u201cAmy\u201d (21 F). We get along fine, but I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re great friends or anything. About 2 weeks ago, Amy started dating this guy (\u201cJosh,\u201d 20 M). \n\nJosh is apparently very allergic to peanuts. Amy says it\u2019s okay if he has some exposure to peanut dust or if peanuts are eaten in his proximity, but he\u2019ll become very ill and possibly die if he eats a peanut. Amy wants to be really careful about peanuts in the house now. I have a big tub of peanuts (maybe 4 inches wide and 5 inches tall; the 2 lb Planter\u2019s peanuts you find at the grocery store) that I eat often as a snack, and Amy asked me to throw it away. I told her no. \n\nI\u2019m happy to purchase a snack besides peanuts when I finish the tub (it\u2019s about half eaten. I\u2019ll probably finish it in about 2 months). I\u2019m not like married to peanuts or anything. But I\u2019m not going to throw away perfectly good food. I was raised without enough food on the table sometimes, and I absolutely will not waste a bunch of food. I know it\u2019s not the biggest deal, but it\u2019s a principle thing for me. \n\nNow, if it was my roommate who was allergic to peanuts, I would definitely consider it. But my roommate\u2019s boyfriend of 2 weeks who does not pay rent here is not a valid reason for me to waste food. I always wipe down the counter after I eat anyways, so I will keep traces of peanut away from Josh, even though he\u2019s okay to come into slight contact with it. If he is concerned about contact with peanuts, he does not have to come over much for the next 2 months. Again, after that, I\u2019ll buy a different snack. But until then, I\u2019m going to keep eating my peanuts and cleaning up after I do so. \n\nThe main reason why I won\u2019t give my peanuts to someone else is for those reasons. I feel that, given Josh\u2019s newness and the fact that he doesn\u2019t live here, I have a right to eat peanuts if I want to, and if I already own them. \n\nAmy is really angry that I won\u2019t get rid of the peanuts. I\u2019ve talked with my friends, and they\u2019re split. Some say I\u2019m the asshole because he can\u2019t help that he\u2019s allergic to peanuts, and I\u2019m creating an environment that may make him uncomfortable. My other friends say I\u2019m not the asshole because it\u2019s my house, my tub of peanuts is older than Amy and Josh\u2019s relationship, and I could get rid of my peanuts only for them to break up. \n\nI wanted to get more opinions on this, as I don\u2019t want to be a major asshole but I\u2019m okay with slightly inconveniencing Amy for the sake of not wasting food.

And hes fine with contact, he can exist in the same place as them for a time if he comes over and visits.\n\nHonestly, wonder if he even knows about this.

I have celiacs disease and I would never ever demand ANYONE remove gluten from their home.

If she throws her food away, that's her business and you can use the money to buy yourself a nutless replacement snack.", "NTA, but the polite adult solution is to just move the peanuts to your room.", "NTA for exactly the reasons you said.

As long as you\u2019re safe which you already are by cleaning up after eating peanuts your life shouldn\u2019t have to change for a person that\u2019ll only occasionally visit.

My nephew has allergies, keeps epi pens and family are careful when preparing food but his siblings still eat foods he\u2019s allergic to like fish. It\u2019s still in the house.
