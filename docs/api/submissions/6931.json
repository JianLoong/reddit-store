We get along fine, but I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re great friends or anything. About 2 weeks ago, Amy started dating this guy (\u201cJosh,\u201d 20 M). \n\nJosh is apparently very allergic to peanuts. Amy says it\u2019s okay if he has some exposure to peanut dust or if peanuts are eaten in his proximity, but he\u2019ll become very ill and possibly die if he eats a peanut. Amy wants to be really careful about peanuts in the house now. I have a big tub of peanuts (maybe 4 inches wide and 5 inches tall; the 2 lb Planter\u2019s peanuts you find at the grocery store) that I eat often as a snack, and Amy asked me to throw it away. I told her no. \n\nI\u2019m happy to purchase a snack besides peanuts when I finish the tub (it\u2019s about half eaten. I\u2019ll probably finish it in about 2 months). I\u2019m not like married to peanuts or anything. But I\u2019m not going to throw away perfectly good food. I was raised without enough food on the table sometimes, and I absolutely will not waste a bunch of food. I know it\u2019s not the biggest deal, but it\u2019s a principle thing for me. \n\nNow, if it was my roommate who was allergic to peanuts, I would definitely consider it. But my roommate\u2019s boyfriend of 2 weeks who does not pay rent here is not a valid reason for me to waste food. I always wipe down the counter after I eat anyways, so I will keep traces of peanut away from Josh, even though he\u2019s okay to come into slight contact with it. If he is concerned about contact with peanuts, he does not have to come over much for the next 2 months. Again, after that, I\u2019ll buy a different snack. But until then, I\u2019m going to keep eating my peanuts and cleaning up after I do so. \n\nThe main reason why I won\u2019t give my peanuts to someone else is for those reasons. I feel that, given Josh\u2019s newness and the fact that he doesn\u2019t live here, I have a right to eat peanuts if I want to, and if I already own them. \n\nAmy is really angry that I won\u2019t get rid of the peanuts. I\u2019ve talked with my friends, and they\u2019re split. Some say I\u2019m the asshole because he can\u2019t help that he\u2019s allergic to peanuts, and I\u2019m creating an environment that may make him uncomfortable. My other friends say I\u2019m not the asshole because it\u2019s my house, my tub of peanuts is older than Amy and Josh\u2019s relationship, and I could get rid of my peanuts only for them to break up. \n\nI wanted to get more opinions on this, as I don\u2019t want to be a major asshole but I\u2019m okay with slightly inconveniencing Amy for the sake of not wasting food.

One preschooler was deathly allergic to dairy, peanuts, and eggs.   **Worse** than you are describing this guy.  We kept that child safe with a little care and cleanliness.  We didn\u2019t allow peanuts, because an open jar of peanut butter or someone eating a peanut butter cookie next to him could make him go into shock, but dairy and eggs, we just kept cleaning and could keep him away from it.

It's the nature of that kind of allergy. I understand not wanting to throw away food, and I understand being irked that your roommate is asking you to make accommodations for someone who isn't your roommate, etc etc, *but* if he has a serious reaction and dies, do you really want to be offering up these excuses?\n\nNAH, but maybe this isn't the hill you want to die on--or rather, maybe this isn't the hill you want someone else to die on.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA possible solution here could be for her to supply you with other snacks in exchange for your peanuts.", "This is a tough one for me, at first I was going to say YTA, then NAH, then ESH. I think I'm going to stick with ESH. **For context, I'm allergic to peanuts at about the same level as Josh.**\n\nWhy you're TA: You need to eat them in a more private space if you really want to respect their right to safety. Amy may have said he's okay with \"some peanut dust\" but you really never know what might set off a reaction. Hell, one time I had a reaction to somebody *touching* me after they ate a PBJ, and I usually don't even get reactions from that. The body is strange like that. I really appreciate that you're trying to wipe down the counter after eating, but think about it this way: Imagine I come home after work or class to find out that just a little earlier my family was eating whole peanuts from a tub on the kitchen counter. I'd be afraid to eat or prepare food there 100%. I understand that whole peanuts can cause a *lot* of crumbs, but that's really a small price to pay for true safety around the house, and that would be a way to actually respect Amy's boyfriend's right to safety.\n\n> Some say I\u2019m the asshole because he can\u2019t help that he\u2019s allergic to peanuts, and I\u2019m creating an environment that may make him uncomfortable.\n\nThis is why they are saying it: It's one thing to eat peanuts when somebody is away, but it's another thing to keep them stored in a public space where he can see it. It may sound stupid, but it's psychological. I've sometimes opened the pantry at my parents' house to see Reese's cups and had thoughts racing through my head, even though it was very irrational.\n\nWhy Amy is the AH: Although I appreciate how hard Amy is trying early in this relationship of hers', if I had found out that my SO was talking to other people in a shared space about my allergy for me and making requests for me, I'd honestly be a bit livid. My allergy (and Josh's in this scenario) is life or death for me, so that's a request for ME to make. What *you* need to do is have a 1-on-1 conversation around him whenever he comes over about this damn tub of peanuts. Stop talking to Amy about it because her and your stubborn-ness will only cause further tension. He's the one with the allergy, so **you** should be the one to talk to him about it.\n\nHope this helps.", ">my tub of peanuts is older than Amy and Josh\u2019s relationship\n\nLmao. \n\nGonna go for ESH. How hard is it to keep the peanuts out of sight? Place them in your own room. And there should not be much trouble.  Your roommate is a bit bold by just going all the way for an allergic reaction that only happens when he eats it. As long as you make sure he won't eat it, you are fine.   \n\n\nAlso who had the resistance to do 2 months with half a bucket of peanuts. I for sure cannot do that. It would be gone in less than a week.", "Info: why can't you just put the peanuts in your room and avoid the issue? \ud83e\udd14", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here. 2 adults who can't come to any solution about such a dumb conflict.\n\nPut the tub of peanuts in your room. Or ask Amy to pay you for the tub and she can throw it out. Or just throw it out and grieve for the wasted peanuts because why fight over something so ridiculous?", "NAH, but sometimes you have to consider the worst-case scenario. How would you feel if he went into anaphylactic shock and died before he could get help because of your peanuts? Would you feel guilty? Or would you still believe that having to eat them in your room was too high a price to pay?", "I don\u2019t know why keeping and eating your peanuts in not-common space isn\u2019t a valid compromise.\n\nESH a little bit for both of you sticking to those positions rather than finding a compromise.", "You have the ability to eat the peanuts in your room, thus creating a safer environment for someone who has done no harm to you.

YTA.", "well I think to be quite fair and honest is ESH. \n\nWhether or not Josh is new doesn't mean you can still leave the peanuts out.

Totally on board with the principle of not wasting good, their relationship is 2 weeks old, he does live there or pay rent, but I\u2019m kinda stuck on two adults who can\u2019t come to a reasonable compromise!!

I\u2019d also be happy to wipe the counters down with Lysol every time I eat peanuts, but Amy didn\u2019t like that idea. She only wants me to get rid of them.", "I'm with you - why doesn't Amy pay you for the peanut tub and then she can throw it away and you can buy a new snack that isn't peanuts.

That's not a solution for not wasting food.", "There is a compromise. They can hang out at boyfriend's place.", "I mean I guess I COULD. Honestly, I could come up with a number of excuses for why I won\u2019t sit on the floor (back hurts, carpet is harder to clean than kitchen tile, whatever). But the truth is, I don\u2019t see why I should sit on the floor in my bedroom in a place that I pay rent for. Most of the time when I eat a snack, Amy isn\u2019t even home, much less her boyfriend, who has only been over once. So frankly, I just don\u2019t want to sit on the floor in my room and eat peanuts. I would rather sit at the kitchen counter and clean properly afterwards.

The peanut thing has only been a conversation between me and Amy", "I am okay with KEEPING them in my room, but I want to eat them at the kitchen.

So if he follows normal boundaries of not eating his gf of 2 weeks roommates food, he should be fine.\n\nOP: double check what kind of cooking oil you guys have in the house. One of my friends almost killed her now husband when they first started dating because she used peanut oil for cooking. Also, anything of yours that is not obviously containing peanuts, but contains peanuts, that should be stored in your room.", "I agree with this. Keeping them out of the common areas is a decent compromise, OP is sticking to their guns just a little bit too hard here, particularly since they admitted they'd be fine no longer buying peanuts after this container is finished.", "exactly this. It makes the room less usable/enjoyable for your roommate and their partner. If someone lives in a shared home, trade-offs may be required.", "Lol I\u2019m not like spreading out to eat my peanuts. It\u2019s more that my room really only has a bed, no chair, table, or anywhere else to eat peanuts. So it\u2019s a factor of not wanting to eat anything in my bed because my room is so small it only has room for a bed", "And he doesn\u2019t NEED to come over.", "Peanut shells in bed sounds horrible.

They can sleep over at his place.", "Given the newness of dating and that you've agreed to not buy more once you're done with these, NTA. Sounds like you're generally respectful of his allergy.

But wouldn't a simple solution be for OP to just bring the peanuts into her room and away from where Josh could accidently eat one.  Not sure how a grown adult with a peanut allergy would accidently eat a peanut but by moving the peanuts out of your public space (in the apartment) you can say you've eliminated the risk to Josh.\n\nThings don't need to be so complicated.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI like the idea of the roommate buying the rest of the can.\n\nMy other suggestion would be to close the can, wipe it down, and go to your next snack option. I'd bet the guy of history in a few more weeks and you can go back to nutting.", "NTA.  Your roommate sounds entitled AF.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s 2 weeks. \n\nHe is Ok with contact or dust!\n\nJust can\u2019t actually eat a peanut!\n\nYou roommate sounds like a stage 5 clinger and no doubt the boyfriend will tire of this nannying behaviour by week 3!\n\nSo the peanuts will be fine", "NTA Have them pay for the tub of peanuts and buy something else, I\u2019m only saying this because it sounds like you are nice enough to be cordial with your roommate other that that I would would eat my peanuts the last month before the lease is over", "Nta. Aside from all the already well laid out points, I have a rule. Unless you pay for my food, you don't have a right to dictate what said food consists of. If he is -that- concerned, he doesn't have to come over. Its nice of you to say you'll buy something else once that tub is gone, although even if you don't do that, still nta. Its your place, not his.", "NTA. If he's old enough to be a boyfriend, he's old enough to restrain himself from eating peanuts. It's not like they are all over the house - they are in one container, right? And it probably has a cover (otherwise the peanuts would go stale in winter). So claiming you are making him uncomfortable because he comes into a house in which he knows there are peanuts (out of sight) is ridiculous.\n\nMy darling grand-niece had dangerous-level allergies to eggs and sesame (thankfully, she outgrew them). At family parties there were always some foods which included these things! Her mother made sure she didn't eat them, and by the time she was 4 she could be responsible not to eat things she wasn't sure about. \n\nThis demand is absolutely out of line.", "NTA, your house and your food, but I get her concerns.

Why not just stop eating them for a few weeks? So what if he's a new bf? He's still a guest in your home, and your insistence on continuing to eat peanuts could be fatal for him. If you're so worried about the cost, you could ask your house mate to reimburse you. Why not just make life less worrying for everyone by finding a new snack?", "YTA just because this is SO petty.  If it were a major hardship (get rid of your pets, throw out ALL your groceries, etc), it would be one thing.  But it's less than $4 worth of food, and you acknowledge that eating someone else in the future wouldn't be a hardship.  That's a reasonable request to make of a roommate.  Especially when you were told he'd be ok with \"some exposure,\" which is not actually \"He's completely safe unless he actually eats the peanut himself\" as a lot of people seem to be reading it.  That could easily be \"We don't need to decontaminate the entire building, but for safety's sake it would be wise to not be adding more peanut dust.\"\n\nSeriously though... less than $4.  That hurdle is so low that it's basically paint, and you still refuse to step over it.

The roommate is being overprotective and her boyfriend is plenty old enough to manage his allergy. At MINIMUM OP could stow the peanuts and have a conversion with him when he comes around to double check that there isn't a risk of an indirect contact reaction. If he says no, she's in the clear. If he says yes, then you go from there. Even so, he's still not a rent paying roommate so he's not entitled to having the place sterilized of any and all peanut related items.
