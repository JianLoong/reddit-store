Then I call them very......colorful names instead. \n\nThat said, I'm not an asshole so basically if you call me anything except \"buddy\", I just move on......I hate buddy.

That one is a regional powderkeg. \n\nIn some parts of the US,  calling a woman \u201cMa\u2019am\u201d is perfectly polite, common and just the proper form of address. While in others, calling a woman \u201cma\u2019am\u201d is acceptable if she is in a position of authority (your boss, policewoman, a judge, your teacher) or if she is old enough to be your grandmother (and not just \u201ca\u201d grandmother, but specifically two generations above you). But\u2026 if she\u2019s not clearly in a position of authority she may assume you are calling her old and may take offense. My mother moved to the South some years back and that part of Southern culture was an adjustment for her. She no longer takes offense to being called \u201cma\u2019am\u201d by people close to her own age, but she can\u2019t bring herself to say it to others, which has lead to her being perceived as rude.\n\nI don\u2019t know if \u201cSir\u201d has quite the same connotations.", "I absolutely hate being called ma\u2019am.

Amazing how the same word has such different connotations in different cultures and circumstances, isn't it? Although it can/should be polite it can also be a very loaded term, especially with a 'sneer' added to the word.

It seems very rude to them.", "Yup. But looking at all my downvotes, apparently I'm the AH if i get someone's pronouns wrong lol.", "I have noticed that too. \nDrives me crazy tbh, but you do what you can while not insulting people on purpose. \n\nMy real issue in 2023 is that I do not have a non-binary equivalent. I am prepared for anything except a person who defines themselves.

(1st job is VP of a company etc....)\n\nFortune babies just benefit from a system that they barely understand. (I had a chance  to tell Rupert Murdoch I wanted to go into journalism because of who my grandparents know)\n\nBut the difference is obviously negligible, so I will earnestly accept nepo baby as an alternative."]}
