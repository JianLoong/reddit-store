I got with my wife Niyah when Leah was nine and married her when Leah was 12. Leah never got on with Niyah, didn\u2019t want to spend time with her and was just generally unpleasant to her. We are currently in family therapy and honestly I think Leah just says the meanest thing possible to avoid actually discussing her feelings with us. She\u2019s absolutely amazing to hang around with one on one but is unpleasant around Niyah. \n\nWe were all supposed to spend Christmas together, as per our custody agreement. Leah is sixteen now and we have been more lenient but we have always adhered to our agreement for holidays and birthdays. On Christmas Eve Leah left to see her boyfriend\u2019s family and drop off her gifts. At around six I call her and ask when she\u2019s heading home, she says she\u2019s staying. I know her mom lives near her boyfriend and asked if that\u2019s where she was going. She didn\u2019t answer. I told her to come home and she pretty much agreed but then never did. I did call her boyfriend\u2019s parents and they confirmed she left to her mother\u2019s and I called her mother who said Leah was there. \n\nNiyah was heartbroken because she felt like Leah didn\u2019t want to be there because of her. This year Niyah handled all the gifts, she did the work of going in store and picking them up/picking them out. I decided my daughter wasn\u2019t allowed to shit on Niyah\u2019s efforts to at least be civil with her, so when Leah got home and I asked why she wasn\u2019t at Christmas, she said she wanted to spend it with her real mom. I said that\u2019s fine. When she asked about her gifts I said her \u201cfake mom\u201d got it for her, so she didn\u2019t need them. Needless to say, she\u2019s pissed at me and hasn\u2019t said anything. Niyah appreciates me putting my foot down, but feels like Leah is a lost cause and to just give her the gifts. Leah\u2019s mom agrees she needs to stop treating Niyah badly and expecting no consequences. AITA?\n\nNote: She has the gifts her mom and boyfriend and other family got her. Just not the one\u2019s Niyah helped with. \n\nI got her a car for Christmas, gifted it to her in November because she needed the car.\n\nLeah is an only child on both sides. I have no other children and don\u2019t plan to. \n\nI am fine with having a relationship with Leah outside of Niyah. My issue is she treats Niyah badly, like subhuman. She acts outright nasty to her. I wouldn\u2019t push so hard if she could at least be civil.

She doesn't have to like your wife, she doesn't have to be all cozy with your wife, but she does need to be civil and respectful. This is the real world, she's nearly an adult, she is definitely old enough to understand the concept of treating others the way she'd like to be treated. Like, basic stuff. It's time she had some consequences. Even her mother is on board. At some point, she needs to have consequences for her actions or she won't learn. This is a basic and important lesson for her. If you shit on someone endlessly, at some point they're going to stop trying. They'll stop caring, they'll stop trying to do things for you. And most importantly, they will stop caring enough to give you things. \n\nShe's been consistently rude and cold to your wife, has refused to even STOP BY and spend some of Christmas with you guys, but she still wants her gifts? No thank you. You don't reward people for being rude. She was rude, she decided not to attend your christmas, so she forfeited her own gifts. The holiday is about spending time together. She doesn't get to request gifts remotely. She didn't want to come over, so that's her choice. She's not 7 years old. She knows damn well you don't get to be like \"I hate you and don't want to be around you, but make sure you send over all my christmas gifts!\" She needs to grow up. This girl is in for a very rude awakening in the real world if someone doesn't start stepping up and teaching her some tough life lessons.", "INFO: How does your daughter treat her bio mom's boyfriend? Is she just as nasty to him? Or is it just with Niyah? (Also, sidebar, Niyah is a beautiful name!)", "NTA. She is 16 and can make her own decisions. That means she can find her consequences. She doesn\u2019t get to be rude and disrespectful and still get gifts. While you should have done some shopping for your daughter, your daughter is being an absolute terror and being \u201coh just a teen\u201d is no excuse. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t like your wife, fine - but that gives her no right to lie and be rude. She can show a certain amount of respect and she should, like it or not. \n\nNext year buy her a single gift from you if you want. Don\u2019t let your wife bother unless she really wants to. It sounds like a waste of money. Your daughter had made her choice. \n\nThis is coming from someone who watched her dad remarry 6 months after her parents divorce at 18 and I hated his new wife but I was at least respectful until it was clear she didn\u2019t respect me and wanted to alienate him. \n\nThe amount of YTA in here is wild. No one is entitled to presents, particularly when they\u2019re being an absolute brat about it.", "It\u2019s probably an unpopular option, but NTA. \n\nMy parents split when I was 10, never liked my new step-mum, but I was at least polite to her, despite making it clear that I\u2019d never have a relationship with her. We don\u2019t buy each other gifts for Christmas or hang out in anyway, but we can coexist around each other. \n\nSo long as Niyah hasn\u2019t done anything specific to piss of Leah, or done anything nasty to her to cause this - which I will assume isn\u2019t the case, because you didn\u2019t mention - then Leah needs to learn how to be polite and civil, without having a relationship. \n\nUnlike others have said, no you don\u2019t need to pick between having a relationship with your daughter or just accepting this.", "INFO - are there other kids in the house? Have similar situations like this happened in the past? When Leah has shown negativity towards Niyah, have you reacted in such a way that would punish Leah? I know you mentioned family therapy. Also calling her a \u201clost cause\u201d is an.. interesting word choice.", "NTA.\n\nI know people are screaming about forced relationships, but there is a large bit that people are glossing over: Leah's mom agrees her behavior is not acceptable and deserves consequences. Usually if this were a case of forcing, or whatever, the other parent would not be siding with you. That her mom is, tells me this goes beyond just being disinterested and into actual nasty rudeness.\n\n16 is old enough to start learning that you reap what you sow when it comes to relationships. You don't get to be mean and rude to someone and then expect gifts from them.", "NTA based on edit both you and her mother agree her behavior towards her is not acceptable. She shouldn't expect gifts from someone she treats wrong. You should sit down outside of therapy and ask her what the real issue is. Has she ever said or did anything to her and is she holding onto the idea of her bio parents getting back together. You don't need to wait for her to share you need to ask and establish boundaries. Understand her feelings but disrespect will not be tolerated.", "This may be unpopular but NTA. \n\nNiyah has no obligation to treat someone who\u2019s hostile towards her. I can see from your edit you gifted her a car earlier in the year - even if you\u2019d revoked your gift I wouldn\u2019t blame you. Your daughter is 16 and that is old enough to be civil. \n\nAlso everyone saying you\u2019re an AH for letting your wife buy the presents needs to grow up. It\u2019s incredibly common for one person in the relationship to buy all the Christmas gifts. Many even enjoy it!\n\nEdit typo", "NTA. Your daughter behaved badly. You gave her a gift already which was incredibly generous. Your wife wanted to give her gifts and was lovely to do so and to keep trying with a kid who has been an ass to her. You\u2019ve tried therapy to address the difficulty in your family dynamic. When your wife said she was a \u201clost cause\u201d I\u2019m assuming she means that you trying to get her to like your wife is a lost cause. If that\u2019s the case I agree with her. I wouldn\u2019t have said the \u201cfake mom\u201d thing. But I get your anger. In hindsight I might have reminded her about the car and said \u201cNyiah has gifts for you because she respects you even if you don\u2019t respect her. Why don\u2019t you have a chat with her.\u201d Or not. Maybe Nyiah isn\u2019t up for it.  All that said, it\u2019s time to let go of the birthday/holiday arrangement. She is indeed old enough to decide what she wants to do. Maybe without the pressure to be with you and your wife when she is clearly unable to handle her emotions things will get better. I would drop the therapy too. Good luck. Reddit isn\u2019t always nuanced in its responses. \n\nEdited for typo", "INFO\n\nWhy doesn't Leah like Niyah? What are the mean things she's saying?", "Why are you asking Reddit? Ask the therapist involved with your family. He or she understands the dynamics and can help you know how to respond. Strangers on the internet do not know this child.", "NTA - I have a difficult teenager. She needs to learn and learn fast that treating people with respect and civility is the bare minimum. MINIMUM. As in, you don\u2019t get anything extra for it. She doesn\u2019t have to call your wife Mum or treat her like she loves her but she does need to be at least civil and respectful. If she can\u2019t be those things at 16 years old after getting a car then, nah. Say goodbye to the extras because she doesn\u2019t deserve them.", "NTA. You already give her a car for Christmas. You are only not giving her the present that your wife selected. And why would you do that if your daughter doesn\u2019t even like her? She is 16, so she is old enough to understand that action has consequences.", "INFO: why does your daughter hate Niyah so much? Can you give some examples of the nasty things she says? What are the mean things she says to the therapist? At 16, why isn't she allowed to choose who she spends the holidays with?", "NTA - she cannot expect gifts from a person she has been rude to. It's not difficult to be polite to another person even if you don't like them. Something she will hopefully learn one day.", "NTA. You are teaching a life lesson. Don't flinch.", "NTA.  Leah can't expect to mistreat Niyah, not show up for Christmas and then get rewarded for that behavior with gifts.  That's just not how it works.  I probably wouldn't have said the bit about the \"fake mom\" but I wouldn't have given her the gifts either.", "No, NTA. I feel bad for your wife, it sounds like she's tried for a long time now only to continually get shat on. Your daughter is fully accountable now, and if she wants to be an arse to your wife and then expect all the gifts she should be in for a shock.\n\nI think it irks me more because I am a child that was caught in a divorce, my dad married my stepmum around the same age and my stepmum has made it her mission in life to delete my sister and I from our dad's life. Despite that I still try and keep up a relationship. Your daughter has the polar opposite and she's being awful.\n\nI would perhaps enquire as to what your ex-wife has said about you/the situation that led to them splitting up. It might be that you've been solely blamed the entire time without you realising it.", "NTA\n\n\nYou can't punish her for her feelings but you absolutely can (and should!!) punish her for being cruel to your wife, and also lying and going to your ex's when she knew she was supposed to be at your house.\n\n\nAnd the fact that your ex agrees that her behavior is unacceptable and that she needs to have consequences says A LOT!!  No other info is required here.\n\n\nI personally would have taken her car away too.", "I was prepared to say YTA. It after reading through, say NTA. \n\nIt is understandable that your daughter, even at 16, may feel your wife is an interloper. At 16, she can also decide with whom she wishes to spend her time \n\nBUT at 16, it also means that if she can make those decisions, she can bear the brunt of her decisions. No, she doesn\u2019t get to be rude to your wife and also expect the presents. \n\nAdd to this that you bought her a car this then goes in to spoiled  brat territory", "NTA.", "Although I think Leah is old enough to decide where she wants to spend Christmas and that you can't force her to have a relationship with your wife, she's definitely old enough not to expect gifts from someone to whom she shows no respect. To me this is clearly bratty behavior. So NTA", "NTA- you still gave her a gift.  She got gifts.\n\nThese are gifts specifically got into her by someone's shes treated like crap.", "Impossible to answer this without knowing your daughter's perspective on why she doesn't like your wife.", "this one is tough\u2026your daughter is 16 and should be able to decide who she wants to spend Christmas with and really at that age, why would she NOT want to spend Christmas with her mom if she\u2019s closer to her? Did you ASK her if she wanted to spend Christmas with you and your wife?\n\nYou say she doesn\u2019t care for your wife and you\u2019re in therapy. Are you going to therapy with you and her or with your wife as well? It could be that she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable discussing her \u201ctrue\u201d feelings around your wife OR she really just doesn\u2019t like your wife (you said she says the meanest things to avoid her true feelings).\n\nWhat kind of relationship do you expect your daughter to have with your wife? Is she polite and / or respectful to her in the house? If yes, that might be all you get. She doesn\u2019t have to \u201cembrace\u201d your wife or have a bond with her, but she does (and should) be respectful. Does your wife trample on her boundaries? \n\nOn the other side, your \u201cpunishment\u201d provides no true solution. For example, next year she\u2019ll be 17 and probably won\u2019t spend Christmas with you then (seems like it\u2019ll be your ex-wife\u2019s turn), then the following year, she\u2019ll be 18 and then it\u2019s nobody\u2019s turn.\n\nWhat, if she refuses to spend the holidays with you are you going to refuse to pay for college?\n\nI\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re an AH, but I really don\u2019t know what she\u2019s being \u201cpunished\u201d for. she wanted to spend the holidays with her mom\u2026while there should have been a conversation, it doesn\u2019t sound like you would have been particularly open to it\u2026so like a rebellious teen, she took her liberties\n\nNAH\u2026I guess?\n\nEDIT: I see you said she\u2019s an only child (meaning you have no kids with your wife) and you don\u2019t want more kids.\n\nNow I really want to know what kind of relationship your wife tries to push with her because if it\u2019s the \u201csecond mom\u201d kinda thing I can see that creating an issue. I see if your OP edits you said you just want them to be civil but has that always been the case? Was there a hope for deeper relationship before?", "NTA, bailing on you, then lying to you, and then coming back to ask for her gifts is entitled.", "Lots of teenage girls in here thinking they are entitled to presents when they can't even be civil to their fathers wife. 16 year Olds are old enough to know there are consequences to being a dick.", "NTA.\n\nI mean, you got her a car, ffs.\n\nIt costs her nothing to be civil to your wife. I think what you did was perfectly fair. Even her own mother agrees with you.", "Ok, speaking as someone who has been in a similar situation as your kid, the real answer lies in why your daughter is acting this way. My parent claims they cannot have a relationship with me if I don\u2019t include my step-mother. We have an extensive history of not getting along, like your wife and daughter sound like they\u2019ve had. You describe your Daughter as someone who is fun to be around without your wife. Have you directly asked her why that is?\n\nI\u2019m not saying your wife is necessarily the problem, but you may be forcing her into your daughter\u2019s life and could be making the problem much worse. \n\nThis could be a good topic to bring up in therapy without your wife there so your daughter can feel safe expressing how she feels, because she may be worried how your wife will react or have hurt her feelings.", "NTA. I mean when her own Bio mom is saying she needs to be civil and that she isn't in a relationship because she's afraid her partner will get treated the same way speaks volumes to me. Your daughter needs to learn to be civil, there are alot of people you'll dislike in the world and you can be like that to them. If there was no infidelity,  no abuse, no forcing into religion that she doesn't want to be in, this is ridiculous.  Name calling in general is ridiculous but to this level without your daughter being able to say these are the examples of why I hate her. Saying you hate someone just for existing is crazy", "Nta. You already got her a car. That\u2019s enough. She shouldn\u2019t be rewarded for treating people like\nShit. \n\nStick to a $50 Sephora gift card for all future gifts moving forward.

Why didn't your ex bring Leah back to your home? How are you and Leah's mother working together on this issue?\n\nI think your comment around Niyah being the \"fake mom\" was an AH thing.

There was a swift and proportionate reaction to her mean-spiritedness, and I love it. You don't treat people like dirt and get rewarded, and I don't care how old you are. FA/FO. NTA, obviously.", "NTA.\n\nShe doesn't have to love your wife, but she also needs to treat her with basic human kindness.\n\nAnd look, teenage girls are pretty awful in general, but they need to learn consequences.", "NTA.\n\nThe fact that so many commenters in this sub seem to feel like a child is entitled to gifts even if they are actively disrespecting the gift-giver is frankly disturbed. The amount of entitlement to believe you shouldn't be teaching your child that treating people poorly will lead to them not doing nice things for you...\n\nYour daughter needs to learn that if she treats other people in a cruel fashion, those people will not continue to treat her kindly. It also sounds like you have something else to bring up with the family therapist- does your daughter hold some hope that you and her mother will get back together? What is your best guess as to why Leah hates Niyah so much?", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t treat someone like shit and expect presents.\n\nShe got presents from mom and boyfriend (and I guess doesn\u2019t have a problem with mom\u2019s boyfriend).

You're not forcing Leah to treat Niyah as her mom, you just want her to be civil and polite. Leah's mom agrees with you that her attitude is not ok. And most importantly, she already got her gift from you (a car nonetheless). The only gifts she's not receiving are the gifts from a person she doesn't like and treats badly. That's a normal consequence in life. She's sixteen, old enough to learn that (she should know that already).\n\nI would however have a one on one conversation with Leah to make sure Niyah isn't treating her badly behind your back (now or in the past). I've seen enough stories here on Reddit where the parent was totally ignorant about how nasty their new SO was being to their child and was just bewildered why their sweet kid couldn't stand their step-parent. It's more likely that you dating and marrying Niyah broke your daughter's hope of having her parents back together or something like that, but you never know.", "Op, it's a good sign that your ex agrees with you.

You and her mother agree on the consequences, and Leah is old enough now to understand why. She got a substantial gift from you already, the car, and if she isn\u2019t going to at least be civil to your wife, she shouldn\u2019t expect to be showered with gifts by her.", "NTA. \n\nYour daughter is purposely acting this way because she doesn't like Niyah.

Leah is acting like a spoiled, entitled brat. Fine, but there are consequences.", "ESH. You're Leah's dad. Why is your wife, who doesn't have a good relationship with Leah, tasked with buying her gifts? You set up Niyah to be disappointed. \n\nLeah should be in therapy on her own, so she can discuss what is going on with her without you and Niyah present. And yes, continue family therapy as well. \n\nLeah needs to start learning how to be honest with herself and everyone else about why she doesn't like Niyah. If she's generally wonderful with everyone EXCEPT Niyah, then the problem is both of them, not just your daughter. Leah is a kid, and kids need to be taught how to express their feelings and issues. It's possible the Niyah did or does something to hurt or annoy Leah, but she doesn't feel comfortable saying it.\n\nStop holding her gifts hostage. Give then to her, but make it clear that you all will be working together to find less toxic ways of communicating, since people don't like to give gifts to people who treat them badly.\n\nLastly, Leah's mom IS her real mom.
