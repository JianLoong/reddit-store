I've calmed down a bit since the initial fight but I'm still on the fence about me being in the wrong so I wanted ask a host of folks who aren't close to the situation.\n\nA few years back my cousin \"Rachel\" (35f) used to date a guy \"Richard\" (32m) who everyone in the family really liked. He was the type of boyfriend who would help out the family move, pick you put if you were in a tight spot and trust to give a key to if your house alarm was going crazy while you were out of town and you wanted someone to check it out. We all loved him and were excited when Richard asked Rachel's parents for their blessing when he said he wanted to propose.\n\nRachel's mom couldn't contain her joy and told so everyone knew that Richard was going to propose and when and the type of ring he was going to use. Before I was born my maternal grandmother had a family ring that she gifted to my aunt (Rachel's mom) as it was tradition that the oldest girl in the maternal line get it as their \"something old\" and then pass it down to the next generation. Unfortunately, as a teen, Rachel's house was broken into and one of the things that was stolen was ring. The women in my family were devastated. Richard paid to have the ring made in the near exact image and used it to propose to Rachel.\n\nWe all thought it was sweet and even though Rachel said \"yes\" she later confessed to not loving her engagement ring and wanted a different one. Unfortunately, this led to Richard and Rachel ending the relationship but since custom made rings couldn't be returned, Rachel and Richard both agreed to let my grandma have it and that was that.\n\nFast forward to now and I'm the one getting engaged. This year we spent Thanksgiving my with my family and while there grandma presented me with the ring so that way it could be my \"something old\" just like the original one and I was so happy. Rachel made a comment about it not making sense since it wasn't the actual ring so it was silly but I said I didn't care.\n\nThe next day Rachel sent me a message about it not only being inappropriate for me to wear the ring that Richard made for her on my wedding day but if we were to follow tradition then she should have it as the \"oldest girl in the maternal line.\" I told her that she had her chance and blew it, gave it to grandma who decided to give it to me. Rachel has since blocked me and told other members in the family that I threw her breakup with Richard in her face and was hurtful. AITA?  \n\n\nEdit: Because I'm seeing this is multiple comments let me clarify   \n\n\n1. I already have an engagement ring that was given to me by my fianc\u00e9 and I was wearing it on Thanksgiving. The ring that my grandma gave me is what I plan to wear on my wedding day (most likely as a necklace) and then keep it to later give to the next girl. \n2. I did stand there and watch Richard and Rachel physically hand over the ring to my grandma? No, however I was told that they agreed to give it to her as a gift and the only time I actually asked Rachel about it she didn't seem upset or say anything in the contrary. \n3. Richard no longer speaks to any of us as he wanted a clean break after the break up. \n4. Part of the reason why Richard went to Rachel's parents was because he wanted to ask my aunt about her opinions on the type of ring she thought Rachel would like. She approved of his decision so Richard thought he was getting Rachel something that she'd like as he wanted to proposal to be a surprise.

But the bottom line is that\u2019s not your problem.  Rebuilding that ring was a sweet symbolic gesture from Robert to your grandmother whom had lost an heirloom.

Afterall, the ring was meant to be hers and even if they agreed to give it to your grandmother, I can promise she didn\u2019t do it expecting you to get the ring.

Plenty of people let their ex-fiances keep the engagement rings after a broken engagement.", "Any weirder than wearing an old ring worn by a bunch of generations of women?

With that context, it\u2019s not nearly as strange, and framing it as simply using a ring custom made for another woman doesn\u2019t seem to accurately depict the situation.", "I have a family member  who had been engaged several times. My aunt was a jewelry designer. She designed one of her engagement rings and after the engagement ended gave it back. The guy gave it to his next fiancee. I always found that weird. \n\nYou can't return a custom ring. You can sell it for a fraction of what you paid for it.

I wonder if he realizes what a close call he had.", "But it was still a copy, made to replace something else. In this instance, it has no meaning beyond being a stand in.

What matters is that OP and her family accepted it.", ">\tit was a custom that was made for a specific person for a specific reason\n\nYes. Indeed. A specific reason. And one half of that reason was to replace a family heirloom. When the other half fell through, the person who paid for it and the rest of the family decided the best course of action was to continue through with the specific reason it was created: to be the replacement for the identical family heirloom. \n\nWhat you guys are essentially saying is you think it would be weird for a man to gift something like this to the family of his ex-fianc\u00e9, but I don\u2019t see the reason for that. It\u2019s not uncommon for exes to go so far as to remain a part of the family after a breakup when they were so close to the family while dating.

But I still contend that if everyone likes the replacement then it can have the same amount of sentiment/ emotional worth.  So neither you nor I decide if it is the family ring.\n\nAnd tbh, I am a bit on the spectrum and I don't always get why some things are 'tacky'.  If my Granny gave me something I don't think I would care how tacky it was I would just love the fact that Granny gave it to me.\n\nI'm now kind of interested how voting on our little debate will go.", "An heirloom is just a random object you keep in the family for sentimental reasons. How isn't this exactly that? Also the time for calling it tacky has passed, now it's grandma's ring passed down to OP.", "Lmao do you think you are telling anybody anything they don\u2019t know? Did you somehow get the false impression that OP thinks *the family ring* she is now in possession of was literally the same exact ring that was stolen so long ago? \n\nIt\u2019s the family ring. Yes, it\u2019s not the same family ring that was previously lost. It\u2019s the family ring that was created as a replica for the one that was lost.

She sounds like a real piece of work to be honest. You don't need her in your life.", "It's a ring she is supposed to and expected to wear on her own finger for the rest of her life. Her opinion of the ring very much matters. If it isn't her style or something she wants, she should be able to tell her fiance that without ending the engagement. Did the two of them never discuss rings? Did Richard do all this with the ring as a surprise, without asking Rachel if she even wanted it for an engagement ring? We don't have any info about how that went down but with the info we have, she isn't an asshole for trying to get a ring she loves.\n\nI absolutely hate rings with stones. 99% of the engagement rings I've seen are pretty but I would not want to wear every day. Thankfully my husband knew me well enough when he proposed to pick a sturdy band with an inset opal so I would be comfortable wearing it all the time. Rachel should also be able to have a ring that she is happy with, considering she has to wear it. \n\nEven OP isn't using this new heirloom as her engagement ring. She is only wearing it for the wedding. Which, had the option been presented to Rachel, may also have been more than acceptable to her. At this point, Rachel no longer has ownership of the ring and pretty much just got screwed out of a relationship and the heirloom for voicing her preference. But OP's grandma ultimately gets to choose now.", "For you and others just above.\n\nTHOUGHT EXERCISE.  Let's say Grandma's HEIRLOOM ring was found.\n\nWould OP have to turn down that ring too?

OP is over simplifying.", "If the ring was 100% solely the grandmother\u2019s and wasn\u2019t a ring with deeply personal sentimental meaning and heartbreak specific to ONLY that cousin? Yeah of course it\u2019s the grandmother\u2019s to do with as she wishes, especially assuming the cousin turned it down.

Neither him or any of the relatives knew Rachel disliked the ring & they all genuinely thought it would be well-received & Rachel would be overjoyed to take her place in her families tradition. So raising something like this would have to be done sensitively. \n\nThe wording OP used towards Rachel does make me wonder whether Rachel had got so used to Richard going above & beyond that she made him feel unappreciated in the way she asked for a different ring. And that's why caused their break up and why the ring now brings such strong emotions for Rachel who is struggling with a break-up her actions initiated.\n\nThis post is so different from usual engagement ring posts we see.

I think people don't understand how very little money he could have gotten if he tried to sell it. \n\nFor a non-custom ring that a person buys from a jewelry store, he could get probably 15% from a pawn shop or reseller.

And that's only *if* the ring eventually sold; that is not guaranteed. \n\nA custom design is more expensive than a non-custom ring -- you have to pay for the labor of the jeweler re-creating your vision, after all.

And your fianc\u00e9 told you she disliked the ring in way that made you feel so unappreciated you reflected on the entire relationship and realised she never fully appreciated the things you did and you realised you didn't want that for your marriage.\n\nI am speculating. But 1 year on Rachel is still incredibly hurt over the break up, even though her actions caused it. Richard went No Contact with the entire family but before he did gifted them the ring for free & OOP says no one was surprised, that's Richard.

I understand this may ruffle some feathers. My husband is a perfect example of not liking the ring I picked out for him nor did I like the ring he picked out for me. We have always had a good laugh about it and we both ended up with rings we wanted. Had we not been in a good place, I\u2019m sure things would never have gotten to the point of taking the next step so I\u2019m guessing they may not have been on the same page as everyone thought.

It wasn't a pair of Gucci boots that she threw in the donation bin and is having donator's remorse. It is an engagement ring, that is emotionally tied to a failed engagement.
