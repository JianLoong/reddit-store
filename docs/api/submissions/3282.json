Like sad \"Friends\" fan fiction.", "I mean even if they had that would be irrelevant to your situation. What matters here is that the ring was your grandmother's, and she gave it to you.

About a year later I thought \u201cwhy the hell not?\u201d And we hit it off great. Ex surprise pikachu faced and was pissed, and went to great lengths to harass us both.  \n\nThe reason I triangulate this story here is because people will react irrationally and contradictory regarding their ex\u2019s.  But the bottom line is that\u2019s not your problem.  Rebuilding that ring was a sweet symbolic gesture from Robert to your grandmother whom had lost an heirloom.  Handing it down is obviously important to your grandmother not important to your sister.  Your sister was briefly in possession of it and the tradition but unceremoniously abandoned it.  Foster that bond with your grandmother and enjoy your new engagement ring.

She was the receiver of the gift and gets to decide what she wants to do with it, as with any gift. The giver is not the owner of the gift when the gift is given to the receiver. Your grandma gave you the ring. And now it is yours. \n\nYou can also replace the word ring with any object. Rachel gave the water bottle to grandma. Grandma gave the bottle you. \n\nNTA.", "My guess is seeing the ring again makes everyone remember how Rachel's relationship ended and it pisses her off.

However, I doubt the ring was the only reason why the engagement ended.", "NTA they broke up because she doesn't like the ring", "YTA\n\nYes, Rachel was being petty in letting an engagement ring break up her relationship. However, getting engaged in a ring that was specifically made for her seems like a slap in the face. It\u2019s literally a symbol of her failed relationship. \n\nI think I would have a different opinion if it was the original heirloom ring, however. And perhaps Grandma is the real asshole here, if she really wanted the ring she shouldn\u2019t be giving it away (and if she\u2019s giving it away, it should be back to Richard)", "ESH......Your cousin didn't want it so has no claim to it now.

It\u2019s not crazy to realize that it would be painful to see an incredibly romantic gesture meant for her on your finger. Honestly I\u2019m surprise you lack that much empathy to realize. I would highly suggest giving the ring back OR getting your cousin\u2019s blessing. Afterall, the ring was meant to be hers and even if they agreed to give it to your grandmother, I can promise she didn\u2019t do it expecting you to get the ring. It should either go to one of her children or not be an engagement ring anymore, as it\u2019s borderline cruel to take the romantic gesture of her failed relationship and turn it into your engagement ring. \n\nAnd yes, I understand she didn\u2019t like the ring. But honestly? She isn\u2019t an AH for wanting to like the ring she\u2019ll wear every day for the rest of her life. But I can promise you, it\u2019s painful for her to be reminded of the relationship she lost. Be more sympathetic to that.", "NTA. Rachel made her bed. Honestly, sounds like she is unhappy with everything. Don't give it to her.", "Props to Richards for dodging a bullet. NTA but your cousin sure is.", "YTA. I wouldn't talk to you anymore either.

That\u2019s just part of the story OP knows as one thing they disagreed upon.", "I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s not the real family ring.  It just comes off as cheap and tacky and weird that all the women in the family are still gushing over a dude your cousin broke up with.  Relationships don\u2019t break up over a ring (you all weren\u2019t in the relationship with him as a partner).  Not to mention your aunt ruined your cousins surprise proposal by being a nosy biddy.  \n\nI\u2019d bet this weeks paycheck Richard was a \u201c everyone has to love me and I\u2019m super different behind closed doors type\u201d.  \n\nHonestly I hope your cousin smartens up and goes LC/NC with all of you for her own sake.", "NTA", "Ok so she ended her relationship over not loving the ring in question.

Who's saving money?", "Money isn't a factor at all. OP has her own engagement ring.

It's a replica of an heirloom piece from \\*her family\\*. It was unreturnable. Do you think he wants to keep a memento from his failed engagement that has sentimental value to a certain family but not to himself? His only alternate was to sell it for probably half of what he paid for it. \n\nIt was a very generous gift, but it is by no means unprecedented. Plenty of people let their ex-fiances keep the engagement rings after a broken engagement.", "Any weirder than wearing an old ring worn by a bunch of generations of women? It's a custom, but it was made to mimic one that had been passed down. What's weird about it? It's not as if Rachel picked the design. She didn't even like it.", "It's a replica of an heirloom piece that their family had in the family for generations. \n\nIt's not weird at all.\n\nJust because you're spooked by an item's recent history doesn't mean everybody has to be.", "That would indeed be weird\u2026 if we ignored the fact that it is a replica of a lost family heirloom. \n\nThe ring served the purpose of replacing that heirloom, so when the engagement fell through and the ring couldn\u2019t be easily returned, it was gifted to the **grandmother**, the one who originally possessed the heirloom, so the ring could fulfill its intended purpose. \n\nIt would be strange without that context. With that context, it\u2019s not nearly as strange, and framing it as simply using a ring custom made for another woman doesn\u2019t seem to accurately depict the situation.", "I have a family member  who had been engaged several times. My aunt was a jewelry designer. She designed one of her engagement rings and after the engagement ended gave it back. The guy gave it to his next fiancee. I always found that weird. \n\nYou can't return a custom ring. You can sell it for a fraction of what you paid for it. In this case, it was the replica of a family heirloom and gifting it to the grandmother was sweet. I think the family treating it at the original makes sense and that erases the \"custom made for someone else\" weirdness.", "yeah i\u2019m honestly confused why someone would want their engagement ring to be one that someone else made for their fianc\u00e9e.", "You might want to add this to your post", "Gotcha, sorry for the confusion there. \n\nMy perspective is that this shouldn\u2019t count as a \u201csomething old\u201d. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else that could be used, but the fun part of heirlooms is the story behind them. The story behind this heirloom is rather painful and isn\u2019t something I would want passed down through generations. \n\nI would be upset if I were Rachel, especially since it sounds like she hasn\u2019t been engaged since Richard and now she lost her chance to carry on the tradition.", "Ooh hadn\u2019t thought of that. \n\nGood catch!", "Idk it\u2019s more about the emotional side to me. Richard went out of his way and put a lot of feeling and money into creating this ring to give to his fianc\u00e9. Using a family heirloom as a wedding ring isn\u2019t odd to me at all. It\u2019s just odd because this wasn\u2019t an heirloom, it was a custom that was made for a specific person for a specific reason, with a lot of feeling behind it.", "OP should be marrying Richard /s", "I'm sorry but why isn't it the family ring?\n\nThere was a ring.  It was stolen.  It got replaced.  Grandma and the family accept the replacement as the family ring.  Therefor it is the family ring.  No one outside the family gets a vote.", "Are you Rachel?", "I'm very happy for Richard & that he GTFO. I wonder if he realizes what a close call he had.", "But it was still a copy, made to replace something else. In this instance, it has no meaning beyond being a stand in. Ok, so Richard had it made, but that relationship ended, so it's no different than if anyone else had gotten it remade. And even Richard only had it made to recreate the situation, so his influence is somewhat limited.\n\nI get what you're saying, but at the same time, I kind of don't? What matters is that OP and her family accepted it.", ">\tit was a custom that was made for a specific person for a specific reason\n\nYes. Indeed. A specific reason. And one half of that reason was to replace a family heirloom. When the other half fell through, the person who paid for it and the rest of the family decided the best course of action was to continue through with the specific reason it was created: to be the replacement for the identical family heirloom. \n\nWhat you guys are essentially saying is you think it would be weird for a man to gift something like this to the family of his ex-fianc\u00e9, but I don\u2019t see the reason for that. It\u2019s not uncommon for exes to go so far as to remain a part of the family after a breakup when they were so close to the family while dating. Him wanting the ring to fulfill its intended purpose even if not through him and his ex isn\u2019t that strange.", "It\u2019s not the actual heirloom that sucks but is also reality. \n\nIt\u2019s tacky as heck to wear her cousins ring from her ex.", "yea i definitely think he made the right choice!", "I\u2019m glad they accepted it and I think that\u2019s all fine and dandy. This is an opinion sub though and my personal opinion is that it\u2019s kinda weird to get engaged with a ring that was used in someone else\u2019s engagement.", "Okay, I agree that it is not an heirloom and if you took it to a jeweler it would not be worth as much monetarily.  But I still contend that if everyone likes the replacement then it can have the same amount of sentiment/ emotional worth.  So neither you nor I decide if it is the family ring.\n\nAnd tbh, I am a bit on the spectrum and I don't always get why some things are 'tacky'.  If my Granny gave me something I don't think I would care how tacky it was I would just love the fact that Granny gave it to me.\n\nI'm now kind of interested how voting on our little debate will go.", "An heirloom is just a random object you keep in the family for sentimental reasons. How isn't this exactly that? Also the time for calling it tacky has passed, now it's grandma's ring passed down to OP.", "Lmao do you think you are telling anybody anything they don\u2019t know? Did you somehow get the false impression that OP thinks *the family ring* she is now in possession of was literally the same exact ring that was stolen so long ago? \n\nIt\u2019s the family ring. Yes, it\u2019s not the same family ring that was previously lost. It\u2019s the family ring that was created as a replica for the one that was lost. Don\u2019t know why this is hard to understand.", "Sure. I'm not saying you're wrong. Like I said, I kind of get where you're coming from, but I can also see the other side.\n\nJust out of curiosity though, would you feel differently if the ring had never been lost and was the original one?", "Cool. Don't do that then. But it harms nobody and labeling it as \"weird\" is pretty judgmental.", "nine times out of ten, I regret reading down these rabbit holes. I'm glad you understand the incredible importance of the sentiment the ring holds; that's the whole point. and as for the ex, the family is grieving that relationship as well. it's not over just for Rachel; the family accepted him into their unit as well. \n\nI'm amazed by this person's complete disregard for the human condition in all of this, though I'm very glad you do."]}
