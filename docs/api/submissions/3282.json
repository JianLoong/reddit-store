Before I was born my maternal grandmother had a family ring that she gifted to my aunt (Rachel's mom) as it was tradition that the oldest girl in the maternal line get it as their \"something old\" and then pass it down to the next generation.

Rachel made a comment about it not making sense since it wasn't the actual ring so it was silly but I said I didn't care. \n\nThe next day Rachel sent me a message about it not only being inappropriate for me to wear the ring that Richard made for her on my wedding day but if we were to follow tradition then she should have it as the \"oldest girl in the maternal line.\" I told her that she had her chance and blew it, gave it to grandma who decided to give it to me. Rachel has since blocked me and told other members in the family that I threw her breakup with Richard in her face and was hurtful.
