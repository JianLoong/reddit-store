Probably because you're still young and live at home. \n\nThere are better ways to get your point across such as sitting her down for a serious discussion on privacy. I know you said you've mentioned it to her but what you need to do is sit her down and tell her she's breaching your privacy boundaries and it's upsetting you. You need to be very direct about it.\n\nAnother way to handle it is to declare yourself a nudest and live 100% naked when you're in your room so if she dares to burst in without warning, she'll get an eye full.

Bc she said not the same, because she has someone over and you don\u2019t. Like does she ever knock when YOU have company?

She thinks she doesn't have to use mannera bc you're her child, but she is incorrect.  Next, I recommend getting a door jam and jamming the door shut when you're in your room with the door closed.
