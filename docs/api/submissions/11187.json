If this continues, you've now talked to them, so you should go to management next. Do not say \"I'll tell our boss on you!\" Just go do it. Threatening to talk to the boss makes you look childish.

There's no such thing as reverse racism, only racism. Honestly \"colonizer\" cannot be meant in a joking way.

Don't try to think up retaliatory names or whatever, that'll only make things worse for you in the long run, but refusing to respond to anything they say when they call you colonizer is legitimate, because that's not what you are called. You can tell boss that you don't know who they're talking to when they don't use your name, because your name is Michael/Andrew/Mieczyslaw/Andrzej or whatever it is.
