{"id": 29565, "submission_id": "17f8fe8", "title": "AITA for asking friend to pay me back for movie ticket for her daughter after last minute cancellation?", "selftext": "My 10 year old daughter has been friends with an 11 year old girl for 8 years ago. They are on the same dance competition team. Her mom and I have been friends since then.\n\nWe were going to the Taylor Swift movie and asked if her daughter was able to go. She confirmed her ticket. Four days before my daughter said \u201cI\u2019m excited the movie this weekend,\u201d to which she responded, \u201cI\u2019m not going because I have other plans.\u201d\n\nI texted mom, \u201cIs it true (name) won\u2019t be going with us to the movie?\u201d She replied, \u201cYup! I thought she told (my daughter) that last week. Sorry about that!\u201d\n\nI responded:\n\u201cI confirmed with you that she could go before we bought the tickets. I do not think it\u2019s appropriate that (you daughter) was to be the one to tell (my daughter). I would have preferred the parents have that discussion. Because when (my daughter) told her tonight \u201cI\u2019m excited for Sunday\u201d she was told she won\u2019t be going because \u201cI have other plans.\u201d I will Venmo request $15 for the ticket.\u201d\n\nHer response:\n\u201cI am not (my daughters) social manager and secretary. She needs to learn how to communicate effectively with her peers and is old enough to do so. I find it appropriate for kids that age to communicate with each other. \nSecondly, when you asked me if she could go, she was free at that time. Sometime later she received a birthday party invitation for that day at that exact time from a girl from school. I asked her what she wanted to do and she said it was an extremely hard decision and needed to think about it. The next day she told me she decided to go to the party because she didn\u2019t know the girls from school well and thought it would be a good time to get to know them better. I also distinctly remember Brooke not coming to (her daughters) birthday party simply because \u201cShe finds Lorelei annoying\u201d so I think it\u2019s fair to say that that was shitty also but we didn\u2019t pitch a fit, we just gave (my daughter) grace and rolled with it, despite (her daughter) being understandably upset\u201d\n\nMy final response:\n\u201cI never said those words. I don\u2019t appreciate you taking any of my words and arranging them to suit this conversation. And telling YOU that (my daughter) wasn\u2019t feeling the friendship at that moment in time is in no way the same was dipping out on a commitment. \n(my daughter) didn\u2019t say she would go and then *reneg* and tell (your daughter) \u201cI have other plans\u201d or even, by your comparison in this conversation, \u201cI find you annoying.\u201d (My daughter) simply decided to not go. Those are two different situations and outcomes.  \n\nI discussed her birthday with you, because while I am not (my daughters) secretary either, I don\u2019t expect her to tell (your daughter) why she didn\u2019t want to go. I hope you didn\u2019t tell (your daughter) the reason, either what I actually said or your above translation. I also did so as a friend. If that was incorrect, I\u2019m open to hearing that.\u201d\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEDIT: We were not able to find someone to go because people had already made plans for the weekend. \n\nEDIT: I can let the $15 go. It\u2019s the flippant apology that feels half-hearted after my family does so much for them. \n\nEDIT: The mom has been flaky in the past. \n\nEDIT: My daughter declined the birthday party invite. She never accepted\n\nCONFIRMING: I never said her daughter was annoying. That was her own translation of my words\n\nBIG EDIT: SPECIAL EVENT TICKETS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. Also, it\u2019s not about the $15. It\u2019s about commitment.

You started a ridiculous manufactured drama for a $15 ticket that you can easily get a refund for, or find someone else to take.\n\nThe woman apologized, but it wasn't good enough for you because it didn't happen how you wanted it.  I would end any friendship between the kids if I was that mom. It's not worth having to listen to your big mouth.", "understood!", "YTA. Who on earth says something like, \"my daughter isn't feeling their friendship at the moment?\" to the other kid's parent, especially about that kid's birthday party? Yes, you implied your daughter found her annoying or worse. I guess the mom's not feeling your friendship anymore either.", "So...you could have gotten a refund, but chose not to.  That would be on you.", "She should refund you the money because they cancelled.", "Okay, that changes things! It wasn't clear in post.
