{"id": 29565, "submission_id": "17f8fe8", "title": "AITA for asking friend to pay me back for movie ticket for her daughter after last minute cancellation?", "selftext": "My 10 year old daughter has been friends with an 11 year old girl for 8 years ago. They are on the same dance competition team. Her mom and I have been friends since then.\n\nWe were going to the Taylor Swift movie and asked if her daughter was able to go. She confirmed her ticket. Four days before my daughter said \u201cI\u2019m excited the movie this weekend,\u201d to which she responded, \u201cI\u2019m not going because I have other plans.\u201d\n\nI texted mom, \u201cIs it true (name) won\u2019t be going with us to the movie?\u201d She replied, \u201cYup! I thought she told (my daughter) that last week. Sorry about that!\u201d\n\nI responded:\n\u201cI confirmed with you that she could go before we bought the tickets. I do not think it\u2019s appropriate that (you daughter) was to be the one to tell (my daughter). I would have preferred the parents have that discussion. Because when (my daughter) told her tonight \u201cI\u2019m excited for Sunday\u201d she was told she won\u2019t be going because \u201cI have other plans.\u201d I will Venmo request $15 for the ticket.\u201d\n\nHer response:\n\u201cI am not (my daughters) social manager and secretary. She needs to learn how to communicate effectively with her peers and is old enough to do so. I find it appropriate for kids that age to communicate with each other. \nSecondly, when you asked me if she could go, she was free at that time. Sometime later she received a birthday party invitation for that day at that exact time from a girl from school. I asked her what she wanted to do and she said it was an extremely hard decision and needed to think about it. The next day she told me she decided to go to the party because she didn\u2019t know the girls from school well and thought it would be a good time to get to know them better. I also distinctly remember Brooke not coming to (her daughters) birthday party simply because \u201cShe finds Lorelei annoying\u201d so I think it\u2019s fair to say that that was shitty also but we didn\u2019t pitch a fit, we just gave (my daughter) grace and rolled with it, despite (her daughter) being understandably upset\u201d\n\nMy final response:\n\u201cI never said those words. I don\u2019t appreciate you taking any of my words and arranging them to suit this conversation. And telling YOU that (my daughter) wasn\u2019t feeling the friendship at that moment in time is in no way the same was dipping out on a commitment. \n(my daughter) didn\u2019t say she would go and then *reneg* and tell (your daughter) \u201cI have other plans\u201d or even, by your comparison in this conversation, \u201cI find you annoying.\u201d (My daughter) simply decided to not go. Those are two different situations and outcomes.  \n\nI discussed her birthday with you, because while I am not (my daughters) secretary either, I don\u2019t expect her to tell (your daughter) why she didn\u2019t want to go. I hope you didn\u2019t tell (your daughter) the reason, either what I actually said or your above translation. I also did so as a friend. If that was incorrect, I\u2019m open to hearing that.\u201d\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEDIT: We were not able to find someone to go because people had already made plans for the weekend. \n\nEDIT: I can let the $15 go. It\u2019s the flippant apology that feels half-hearted after my family does so much for them. \n\nEDIT: The mom has been flaky in the past.

She needs to learn how to communicate effectively with her peers and is old enough to do so. \" ... your daughter is 10. Yes, you are both her social manager and secretary.", "YTA\n\nIf this is how you parent, I have a pretty good idea why the birthday is a better choice than hanging out with your family. It's a movie and they are 11, it's not a wedding. Give the ticket to another friend and move on like a normal person.", "ESH\n\nOf course communication could have been better, but to get pissy and call it out, isn't doing your daughter any favours. For $15 dollars you have probably caused her a big headache.\n\nYou have to choose your battles wisely.", "she apologized. it was an oversight. that happens with kids. you sound like a hell of a lot of work. asking for reimbursement for the ticket is\u2026 a bit much. she can\u2019t use it and you can ask someone else. but your incredibly wordy accusatory texts are way over the top. yta.", "YTA\n\nThe other mum apologised and you have 4 whole days to find someone else to use the ticket. Your aggressive (and exhausting tbh) messaging is causing unnecessary drama for your daughter and her friend.", "I think I'm debating between YTA and E S H.\n\nWhy I'm leaning towards you're the asshole is because 1. You had 4 days to make a new plan. It's not as though  you learned that her daughter wouldn't be attending at the last minute. In my opinion, 4 days is ample time. And 2. She apologised. Yes, your children are young but, I don't think they're incapable of communicating changes in plans with one another. Which her daughter did. Admittedly, not in the most amazing way but, she's a child and she told your daughter days in advance. \n\nWhy I was considering E S H is because I think you're both making this a far bigger deal than it needs to be, in my opinion. Like is 15 dollars really worth straining two friendships? Come on now. However, you're the one who escalated it so, I think I still consider you the asshole. She likely wouldn't have had a problem giving you the money back if you couldn't find another use for the ticket if you hadn't spoken to her with so much animosity.\n\nEdit: I think animosity may be too harsh of a word choice on my part. Maybe antagonise would've worked better but, my broader sentiment still stands.", "YTA, it's $15, don't ruin a friendship over something so trivial. Ask another family member if they would like to go instead.", "YTA because you have escalated a kid-centric issue having forgotten that kids are fickle, getting involved in their friendships is pointless as they change with the wind, and arguments with parents about the decisions their kids make are dull and overly emotive. Move on and next time be clear about who pays what before you spend any money.", "How much was her ticket?", "ESH\nYou are NTA for expecting her to pay for ticket she asked you to get (unless you were paying anyway)  if is non refundable \n\nIt is rubbish that they ducked out and have left you with a spare ticket you bought for her  daughter. \n\nCan you get a refund? Or find another friend to go if you were paying for it anyway ? If not then either way is a bit off of this friend/ family waiting until after you paid for  the tickets,  flakey behaviour. \n\nLol at anyone not being social secretary for their 10/11 year old child!! Of course you are! They don\u2019t have their own money and cars to get there! It\u2019s not like they\u2019re 15+ and catch bus to meet each other and buying their own tickets. \n\nDon\u2019t disagree with you on any of that. \n\nBut the way you worded your texts to her Mum sounded really off. Almost argumentative from the start and I think  you could have chosen your words better\nEg if they were supposed to pay you back for ticket.. \n\n\u201cHi, (Friend) said to (daughter) she\u2019s not going to cinema anymore, but you\u2019d asked me to get ticket for her. It\u2019s non refundable ... what do you think we should do?/ can you  still pay for it, it is \u00a3x\u201d \n\nIf they weren\u2019t supposed to pay you for ticket I\u2019d modify that \n\nUltimately as a parent you have to swallow this cost  for the girls friendship and not make a big deal, but I wouldn\u2019t invite friend again or her mum sorts out her own tickets if there is a next time as you know they may be  unreliable at your financial cost. I hope your daughter can invite a nicer friend who doesn\u2019t drop her for a later \u201cbetter offer\u201d", "Just forget it.\nThis is pay back for the horrible way you and your daughter acted over the little girl\u2019s birthday party. That was an awful thing to say and it was not nice of your daughter to treat her friend like that. Instead of telling the mother it was bc your daughter found her daughter annoying or whatever you said, you should have taught your daughter that you respect people who were good enough to befriend you, and while some of those friendships will end, you still treat them with respect. As  mom you should of told her that she made plans and she was going. Also, saying that you told the mom \u201cout of friendship\u201d was the icing on the cake (pun intended). That was a real piece of work. You got out played. Both should stop it now.", "The other mom is an asshole. How can she agree to something but change and neglect to tell you about it at the last minute. Then have the balls to blame her daughter! \n\nDamn then try to justify it by bringing up your daughter's past action. Damn she's sound extremely bitter and petty. Just forget about the $15 and enjoy the movie with your daughter.", "I agree I should have probably given myself a 24 hour window to chill before I responded. Could have done that a lot better. So then do I apologize for the messaging?", "ESH. You\u2019re being petty over $15, and she\u2019s being petty about you being petty. Two adults should both be able to let things slide.", "ESH\n\nWhat a lot of tedious nonsense.", "ESH next time Venmo first then buy tickets.", "NTA, but in the future make sure the mom has paid BEFORE you buy anything for her or her kid if you choose to continue friendships with them.", "NTA not even the slightest bit", "God flaky people are the worst.
