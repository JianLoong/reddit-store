{"id": 10305, "submission_id": "115mfys", "title": "AITA For Naming My Second Son \"Junior\"?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (38m) recently had my third child Junior who is my second with my current wife Jenny (29f). My first son Ben (13m) is from my previously relationship with my first wife Kim (39f). When Kim and I first found out that she was pregnant I told her that if we had a son I wanted his first name to be after my father and his middle name to be my maternal grandfather's surname effectively making him a type of Junior and if we had a girl I would go along with whatever she decided.\n\nKim was hesitant at first but after I explained how important this was to me Kim agreed to name with the understanding that our next child, regardless of gender, Kim would have full control over the first and middle name. I thought we were good until after the sonogram confirmed that we were definitely having a boy and then Kim decided that she no longer agreed to the name and wanted to change it. I didn't hide how upset I was that Kim was going back on her word. She threw in my face the fact that she was the one who was carrying the baby, which I felt was a low blow. Neither one of us were willing to budge I really started to resent that Kim not only was going back on her word but also crying to her family who then berated me for stressing out a pregnant woman, and telling me that I just needed to be grateful for a healthy instead of being fixated on the name.\n\nWhen I came home from work I couldn't find Kim and since she was supposed to be on bed rest I got worried and tried calling her. She didn't pick up so I tried calling and even driving around to find her but no one picked up or was there. I panicked for about 16 hours until I finally got a call from Kim's mom saying that she was in the hospital and just given birth to Ben about an hour ago. I shocked and after meeting my son and making sure that there were no complications, I became enraged. I missed the birth of my son and no one called me until after my son's name was on the birth certificate.\n\nOur marriage didn't recover and we divorced, and I was painted as the petty, irrational, and selfish one for ending a marriage over a name. Fast forward to now and Jenny has given birth to twins Junior and Alyssa and we gave our son the name that I had originally wanted for Ben while Jenny had free rein to name our daughter whatever she wanted. We posted pics of our babies three weeks later and Jenny and made a heartfelt post about how each name was significant to us. Ben saw the post and I guess he was a little upset at how meaningful and familial his brother's name was because he asked me why I didn't give him that name.\n\nI simply shrugged and told him that I did want to initially name him that but it didn't work out. Now Kim is upset with me saying that I am purposefully being cruel, and how Ben now feels less compared to brother and that I shouldn't of name my new son what I did since I couldn't get my way the first time. I told Kim to f off, but given our tense history I have to ask AITA?\n\nETA: Because a few people have asked...\n\n1. Kim and I both share 50/50 custody. Established and enforced by the courts.\n2. No, Ben doesn't know all the details surrounding his name. He just knows that his mom picked out his name and we divorced because we were too young and immature. I could tell him the truth but it would honestly be my word against his mom's and I know her mom and sister (the people who were actually in the birthing room) would lie for her. So I'm just letting it be for now.\n3. I wanted my son to have my father's first name because when I was around 13 both my parents were in a car accident and my dad didn't survive.\n4. I wanted my son to have my grandfather's surname because helped raised me after my dad was gone.\n5. Technically my second isn't a \"Junior\" but is at the same time. I have no intention of actually calling him that but if he wants to be referred that way once he's older I will.\n6. Again, my way of compromising was that I get to name our first child and then she could name the next regardless of gender.\n\nETA 2: Just to be clear...  \n\n\n1. Kim is the one SAYING that Ben feels less loved Ben and he hasn't said anything directly to me about it and Kim's word alone doesn't mean much to me. I love Ben and spend time with him, and make sure he's knows I want him around.\n2. No I don't like Ben's name. Although, I'd never tell him that.\n3. When I first proposed the name Kim admitted to not being sure what to name the baby and when she expressed no longer desiring the name she admitted she still wasn't sure what name she wanted instead. \n4. Kim and I were married at the time of Ben's birth so my name was going on the birth certificate regardless.

Her safety and feelings matter more than his here. If his presence was going to stress her out, she was right to exclude him, because stress makes labor more dangerous for the birthing parent. I nearly died twice in labor. The last thing I would have needed was someone who made me stressed in the room, with my blood pressure already sky high.", "There is a difference between coercion and convincing your spouse of something that is important to you. Marriage needs a lot more flexibility in doing things someone doesn\u2019t want, which is why she agreed in the first place. \n\nI also think you are overestimating her opinion on the name. She didn\u2019t like it, sure, but there was nothing that indicated \u201chate\u201d. The post says she was \u201chesitant\u201d. Not that she hated it. Maybe it was \u201cWilliam\u201d, and she wasn\u2019t a fan. There is nothing to suggest it was a \u201cPoindexter\u201d or something strange. I don\u2019t know the names, but attributing \u201chate\u201d in place of \u201chesitant\u201d is taking a huge leap. \n\nUltimately, the concept you are adding- that it would be life-long suffering with the name- is not part of the story, so should not be added. So the correct comparison is breaking an agreement with your spouse, or not having total control over the name and ignoring your spouses wishes altogether. And as you said, it should be two yesses, not one no. The name he wanted had two yesses up until the point she completely abandoned him. In a marriage, the appealing choice should be to not abandon your spouse", "Yes, but it doesn't sound like Kim agreed to the name Dad picked so much as got tired of being talked over and not listened to.", "The way you phrased the comment, as well as your other comment berating him makes it clear it's not a serious question in good faith \n\nAnd people talk about things?

It is hard when someone has a firm idea on the first and middle name, leaving almost no room for discussion. My husband had a firm idea on our kid's first name, but no idea for the middle. I had one that was meaningful to my family history for the middle. That is a compromise- but OP claiming the first and middle means she got zero say into the name of her first kid. Sometimes there isn't a second child for any number of reasons, so saying \"you can name the second\" isn't a great offer.", "Pattern recognition isn't for everyone unfortunately.

OP had a first and middle name picked out, leaving no real room for a compromise on this kid's name. He was willing to give ground on hypothetical future kids, but she had no way of being sure those kids would exist or that he would honor his word.
