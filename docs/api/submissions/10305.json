{"id": 10305, "submission_id": "115mfys", "title": "AITA For Naming My Second Son \"Junior\"?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (38m) recently had my third child Junior who is my second with my current wife Jenny (29f). My first son Ben (13m) is from my previously relationship with my first wife Kim (39f). When Kim and I first found out that she was pregnant I told her that if we had a son I wanted his first name to be after my father and his middle name to be my maternal grandfather's surname effectively making him a type of Junior and if we had a girl I would go along with whatever she decided.\n\nKim was hesitant at first but after I explained how important this was to me Kim agreed to name with the understanding that our next child, regardless of gender, Kim would have full control over the first and middle name. I thought we were good until after the sonogram confirmed that we were definitely having a boy and then Kim decided that she no longer agreed to the name and wanted to change it. I didn't hide how upset I was that Kim was going back on her word. She threw in my face the fact that she was the one who was carrying the baby, which I felt was a low blow. Neither one of us were willing to budge I really started to resent that Kim not only was going back on her word but also crying to her family who then berated me for stressing out a pregnant woman, and telling me that I just needed to be grateful for a healthy instead of being fixated on the name.\n\nWhen I came home from work I couldn't find Kim and since she was supposed to be on bed rest I got worried and tried calling her. She didn't pick up so I tried calling and even driving around to find her but no one picked up or was there. I panicked for about 16 hours until I finally got a call from Kim's mom saying that she was in the hospital and just given birth to Ben about an hour ago. I shocked and after meeting my son and making sure that there were no complications, I became enraged. I missed the birth of my son and no one called me until after my son's name was on the birth certificate.\n\nOur marriage didn't recover and we divorced, and I was painted as the petty, irrational, and selfish one for ending a marriage over a name. Fast forward to now and Jenny has given birth to twins Junior and Alyssa and we gave our son the name that I had originally wanted for Ben while Jenny had free rein to name our daughter whatever she wanted. We posted pics of our babies three weeks later and Jenny and made a heartfelt post about how each name was significant to us. Ben saw the post and I guess he was a little upset at how meaningful and familial his brother's name was because he asked me why I didn't give him that name.\n\nI simply shrugged and told him that I did want to initially name him that but it didn't work out. Now Kim is upset with me saying that I am purposefully being cruel, and how Ben now feels less compared to brother and that I shouldn't of name my new son what I did since I couldn't get my way the first time. I told Kim to f off, but given our tense history I have to ask AITA?  \n\n\nETA: Because a few people have asked...\n\n1. Kim and I both share 50/50 custody. Established and enforced by the courts.\n2. No, Ben doesn't know all the details surrounding his name. He just knows that his mom picked out his name and we divorced because we were too young and immature. I could tell him the truth but it would honestly be my word against his mom's and I know her mom and sister (the people who were actually in the birthing room) would lie for her. So I'm just letting it be for now.\n3. I wanted my son to have my father's first name because when I was around 13 both my parents were in a car accident and my dad didn't survive. \n4. I wanted my son to have my grandfather's surname because helped raised me after my dad was gone. \n5. Technically my second isn't a \"Junior\" but is at the same time. I have no intention of actually calling him that but if he wants to be referred that way once he's older I will. \n6. Again, my way of compromising was that I get to name our first child and then she could name the next regardless of gender.", "created_utc": 1676746735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115mfys/aita_for_naming_my_second_son_junior/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
