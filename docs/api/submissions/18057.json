(And now are going to be downvoting me for pointing out their lack of objectivity, which merely proves my point) .  I'm not religious either, and this event sounds awful to me, but that's not the issue at hand. The issue is whether a stepparent should insert herself into a situation that is between a parent and her children. Jodie gets visitation, and unless she's doing something that objectively exposes her children to harm, she has a right to require them to do whatever she wants with them during her visitation time. As much as redditers may find religion in general bad, and revivals like this weird and cult-like (I do too), you're not going to find a family law court in the land that would say they constitute objective harm to a child to attend, and barring a parent with parental rights from exposing their child to them would constitute a violation of that parent's First Amendment rights.\n\nSo, YTA. Father has some right to argue with his ex on whether this is the right thing for their children, and right to tell mother he isn't going to back her up if she does require the kids to attend, but you're the step parent, you don't get a say in this.  You saying you wouldn't require them to is undermining her, which isn't your place as stepparent. And sharing your feelings about the event was unproductive and irrelevant. No one expects you to convince the kids to go with her, but you could and should have said \"That's between you and Bob and the kids.\"\n\nFurthermore, this is not the only time the OP's ownership mindset over her husband and Jodie's kids has gotten in the way, and caused problems, and that OP's perception and depiction of Jodie and her relationship with her kids may not be all that accurate.\r  \n\r  \nA month ago, this same OP wrote that Jodie gifted OP's husband a free cruise, which husband adamently refused to go on (his right and the wise decision). The 16 year old was furious that they weren't going on the cruise and ended up moving in with Jodie and Jodie and 16 yo went on the cruise together. So it seems like at least the oldest has a better relationship with Jodie than a lot of people here are concluding from OP's comments in this thread. It also struck me that OP said when her husband put his foot down about the cruise, OP \"decided to back him up.\" I got the idea that the 16 year old was angry with OP, too, which is why OP came to AITA with the question. Why did OP feel the need to \"back him up\"? The father had made the decision, which was between him and Jodie, and it was the decision OP wanted, so she could have just kept her mouth shut, but a step parent weighing in against a teenager having something the teenager and the ex both want isn't going to sway the teenager, it's going to make the conflict worse.\r  \n\r  \nThen there was the OP's post 10 months ago where she asked \"AITA for preventing my stepdaughter from visiting a dangerous country with her mom?\" Both Jodie and OP's husband were fine with the 16 year old and Jodie visiting their relatives in Jodie's home country. OP did not agree, and demanded that the mother and father discuss their decision with OP. She clearly doesn't understand the boundaries of her say in these childrens' lives as their stepmother.", "YTA for calling her kids your kids.

I told my FIL that I didn't like it because it was supposed to be a memorial service for my husband, who was not the type to shove religion down anybody's throat, and was incredibly inappropriate.  He didn't say anything after that.\n\nMy FIL passed away a year and a half ago and my kids and I went to the service.  Listening to people talk about my FIL and how he was a man of god and such an amazing, god fearing man, just about made me puke.  I had known that man for years.  My husband told me how his dad treated him when he was a kid.  He tried to treat my son like shit, but I had told my son that he didn't have to take that shit from his grandpa, so he didn't.
