Good job protecting the kids.", "NTA - The kids are old enough to decide what they are interested in.

Also, the way she's talking about religion really does feel like a cult", "Nta.

If \u201cJodie\u201d is anything like described, based on my own experiences with that kind of person\u2026the kids are better off staying far, far away from that stuff.  Kids made the right choice, and you backing that up is the correct thing to do.", "NTA. The event doesn't sound suitable for kids and, quite frankly, sounds like a cult indoctrination activity. By depriving people of sleep, people's ability to think deteriorates - keeping them engaged in \"praying and stuff\" in that state is a red flag. Honestly, I would not have even asked any kid if they wanted to go, I'd have prohibited them from going - that is some scary sh!t right there!", "NTA, if it\u2019s during your custody time, Jodie can\u2019t force the kids to go.  You were being very generous to give the kids the option to attend.  If Jodie wants to \u201crequire\u201d the kids to go, she needs to go back to court.", "NTA. The kids are old enough to decide, and as long as you are asking them, you are doing nothing wrong. Also, an all night event sounds like too much as the kids do not even go to the church normally. If Jodie wants to introduce the kids to religion, she should go slowly and see if they are willing. Forcing them to go is not going to be helpful.", "NTA.\n\nThe only way this would be okay was if the kids were originally raised in a religious setting with their dad and bio-mom, and it sounds like they were not.  There is absolutely NO way you should let them get pulled into some cult that their bio-mom's new boyfriend is in.  That's how kids get kidnapped and/or brainwashed. Keep those kids safe.", "NTA.  Not only did you respect the kids\u2019 preferences, you checked in with their dad. \n\nWe will wish Jodie good luck with her devil.", "Absolutely NTA! The real assholes are all the parents that force their kids to go to church against their will.", "Omg no..they were probably going to be sacrificial lambs..or worst..be trapped in that cult and no escape...totally not the asshole...Jodie is dangerous I'm so glad you have them all the time", "So she knew by asking the kids they'd say no...but she can't being said no to...so she picked you to ask ..well played jodie", "NTA, she shouldn't be forcing your kids to practice a religion they don't believe anyway, but she also shouldn't be dictating your husband lets her either. And honestly, an all night prayer meet does sound kinda cult like, as does her comment about \"the devil attacking her\"", "NTA \u2014 You ascertained the kids\u2019 wishes, checked in with their custodial parent who isn\u2019t reliably available at this time, and relayed their decision to the noncustodial parent. No matter what the event was, you followed the correct procedure.\n\nBeyond that, I did get brought to a Pentecostal prayer/worship evening as a kid and was super weirder out by it. Do not recommend.", "NTA\n\nBut you aren't going to convince Jodie of anything if you call her religion a cult to her face. While I personally agree with your assessment, I don't think it's the right argument to use when protecting the kids because she's immediately going to be defensive and dismiss everything you say.", "Also, congratulations on your seemingly very reasonable husband.\n\nNTA, obviously. Jodie seems bonkers. \"The devil was attacking her\", JFC, what's wrong with you, Jodie??", "Correct, as a teenager who has been forced to go to church many times I now hate it. I will try as hard as possible or to go, no one wants to be forced to go where they they don\u2019t want to", "She knows they would say no. That's why she wanted OP to \"require\" them to go. Which would also make OP the bad guy when the kids don't enjoy the event.", "I don\u2019t know\u2026I\u2019d guess it\u2019s because I\u2019m their primary caregiver when my husband isn\u2019t around. But yeah, I\u2019m not sure", "I mean, they don't even want to go to church normally, never mind an all-night prayer session. She probably knew the kids would refuse", "Because they would say no and she wants OP to force them to attend her cult event. So hard NTA.", "Because that goes against religion.", "Someday; I really hope red flag statements like that are handled with the proffesional concern that they should be and not celebrated as being \"faithful\" like they are in these backward modern times.", "TBH, \u201cif\u201d OP was \u201cintentionally stepping between them and their mother\u201d in this situation, it would still be NTA.  Stuff like \u201cJodie\u201d wants them involved with is incredibly dangerous\u2026.especially to kids.  Just because Jodie is their mother, doesn\u2019t mean that anything and everything she would want is automatically a good idea.", "Don't have any awards \ud83d\ude1e", "Plus, be a prime opportunity for some youth minister to be alone with them.  That by itself should be enough to flat out refuse to allow them to go to something like that.", "Yup, I grew up in the midst of nothing but fundie evangelicals.  That was my first thought.  This was going to be a way for her have a big performative show of \u201cbringing her children to the flock\u201d. Either against their will or not.  A good rule is NEVER trust a Christian to be honest.", "She doesn\u2019t have 25% anymore. Just two weekends a month, and only the younger two are required to go. She doesn\u2019t always keep them on her weekends, it\u2019s more like 10 weekends a year or so. But yes, it\u2019s technically her weekend, though we\u2019d do the swap on Sunday morning before she goes to church", "Unfortunately this kind of bullshit is common in the US. - A former Texan", "I\u2019m suspicious of what this event would entail for the future. If they go to church once, they\u2019ll be expected to go again. Religion is often used in custody battles to argue why a child shouldn\u2019t be in the custody of another parent and a part of me wonders if now that she\u2019s dating Eddie, Jodie wants to involve the kids in the church community, then go for custody of the younger ones. Something about getting a partner tends to make previously uninvolved parents want to suddenly be involved in my experience.", "Does your husband have custody?", "OP, you need to protect those kids. Tell them not to answer the door unless you\u2019re there too. I don\u2019t know if Jodie has a history of violating court orders, but people can get crazy when they feel their loved ones\u2019 souls are at stake.", "In an era where ppl have apps to message each other and phones to call, she calls you to ask them and even gets offended. Well she should call or message them to ask so she can hear the NO directly from them. NTA", "It\u2019s probably because she knows that they\u2019d say no if she were to ask them so she wanted to leverage someone else in authority to try to force them to go. Christians can be manipulative like that.", "If it\u2019s her time, it\u2019s her issue to get them to go. You still have to give them to her during her custody time, but you def don\u2019t have to convince them they need to go to this religious event. If you swap before the event and take them home, then you have no obligation to leave them with her longer but that\u2019s on Sunday. You said the event is on Saturday so yeah, you have to let her deal with them attending or not", "That's a good point. Particularly with it's \"praying and stuff from dinner time Saturday to the end of church on Sunday\" which means what, 24 hours of praying and no sleep? Why do I suspect the last part of that would be a conversion to that church (or maybe a baptism or similar) when they are too tired and disoriented to say no?", "Yes, he has primary custody. Jodie gets 2 weekends/ month, but she doesn\u2019t always pick them up.", "Because she (Jodie) thinks children should always be subservient to their elders. Plus she probably already knew their choices and wanted to blame the OP or the Devil. ;)", "I'd hope that they could tell Jodie, \"no\" and wouldn't cave to appease her innevitable attempts to pitty herself and manipulate them.. alot of parents do that. Can't necessarily speak.for Jodie tho... she sounds like she's more of the, \"because I said so\" type.", "She was hoping to have OP\u2019s help forcing her kids into religion", "Exactly, the intentions of that woman are clearly bad"]}
