You asked the kids of they don't want to go you can't force them.", "NTA\n\nThey are old enough to make that kind of choice for themselves. There's got to be a good reason she doesn't have more custody--the inability to put her minor children before her partner is telling.\n\nI had LDS neighbors, this was the kind of thing they did.

Forcing it on them will almost always have the reverse effect.\n\nYou're right. These events are cult like. I would know. I was in a church that regularly had events like this. It's fucking weird.

We would get to church at 9am and would listen to nonstop preaching from different pastors until well into the evening, after which I\u2019d run to the fellowship hall so I could eat something before I passed out. It was miserable and if I looked tired or bored my dad and stepmom would yell at me later for embarrassing them in front of the congregation.\n\nIt didn\u2019t make me like church any better (had quite the opposite effect) and I swore every year if I had kids, they\u2019d never go through this.

You can't force someone of any age to genuinely feel or believe something. But parents do have a well-established legal right to force their children to go through the motions until they are 18, as counterproductive as that may be to the parents' ultimate goals of their kids genuinely believing, or liking them.

OP- I\u2019m not saying this could happen, but please be mindful of how their mom escalates in her religion. With her saying that you\u2019re opinion was an attack from the devil, I can see she has the potential for delusions not unlike the one I mentioned above (although probably much less extreme).

This is why I voted YTA. I totally agree with OP's opinion that kids shouldn't be required to go to this event, but as stepmother, it's not her call, she should leave it between the kids, the dad, and Jodie, but this mindset she has is clouding her judgement.", "Yeah, this dynamic is weird.", "It doesn't sound like this was the mother's visitation time.
