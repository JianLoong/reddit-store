If \u201cJodie\u201d is anything like described, based on my own experiences with that kind of person\u2026the kids are better off staying far, far away from that stuff.  Kids made the right choice, and you backing that up is the correct thing to do.", "NTA. The event doesn't sound suitable for kids and, quite frankly, sounds like a cult indoctrination activity. By depriving people of sleep, people's ability to think deteriorates - keeping them engaged in \"praying and stuff\" in that state is a red flag.

You were being very generous to give the kids the option to attend.  If Jodie wants to \u201crequire\u201d the kids to go, she needs to go back to court.", "NTA. The kids are old enough to decide, and as long as you are asking them, you are doing nothing wrong. Also, an all night event sounds like too much as the kids do not even go to the church normally.

Forcing them to go is not going to be helpful.", "NTA.\n\nThe only way this would be okay was if the kids were originally raised in a religious setting with their dad and bio-mom, and it sounds like they were not.

No matter what the event was, you followed the correct procedure.\n\nBeyond that, I did get brought to a Pentecostal prayer/worship evening as a kid and was super weirder out by it. Do not recommend.", "NTA\n\nBut you aren't going to convince Jodie of anything if you call her religion a cult to her face. While I personally agree with your assessment, I don't think it's the right argument to use when protecting the kids because she's immediately going to be defensive and dismiss everything you say.", "Also, congratulations on your seemingly very reasonable husband.\n\nNTA, obviously.

If they go to church once, they\u2019ll be expected to go again. Religion is often used in custody battles to argue why a child shouldn\u2019t be in the custody of another parent and a part of me wonders if now that she\u2019s dating Eddie, Jodie wants to involve the kids in the church community, then go for custody of the younger ones. Something about getting a partner tends to make previously uninvolved parents want to suddenly be involved in my experience.", "Does your husband have custody?", "OP, you need to protect those kids. Tell them not to answer the door unless you\u2019re there too.

Well she should call or message them to ask so she can hear the NO directly from them.

Christians can be manipulative like that.", "If it\u2019s her time, it\u2019s her issue to get them to go. You still have to give them to her during her custody time, but you def don\u2019t have to convince them they need to go to this religious event. If you swap before the event and take them home, then you have no obligation to leave them with her longer but that\u2019s on Sunday. You said the event is on Saturday so yeah, you have to let her deal with them attending or not", "That's a good point. Particularly with it's \"praying and stuff from dinner time Saturday to the end of church on Sunday\" which means what, 24 hours of praying and no sleep? Why do I suspect the last part of that would be a conversion to that church (or maybe a baptism or similar) when they are too tired and disoriented to say no?", "Yes, he has primary custody.

Plus she probably already knew their choices and wanted to blame the OP or the Devil. ;)", "I'd hope that they could tell Jodie, \"no\" and wouldn't cave to appease her innevitable attempts to pitty herself and manipulate them.. alot of parents do that.

This is ridiculous.", "This is just wild to me. I enjoyed going to church when I was a kid. It was just something to do. I mean yes my grandparents expected it of me.
