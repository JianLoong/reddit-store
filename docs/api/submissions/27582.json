I was 30 weeks on my fourth child- my other pregnancies were flawless. This little wild man had growth problems, I had preeclampsia , everything was really scary and really new for me. I was rushed to the emergency room because my blood pressure was like 200/100. They started monitoring me and discussing me getting the shots to strengthen my son\u2019s lungs bc he was probably coming early. I\u2019m starting to panic because I never had to prepare for this. My others were full term. \n\nThe 12 year old nurse, clearly still in orientation, straight up asks me if my son was Caucasian.  I found this to be odd. but I am an RN too, so I figured she had a point to make. I answered that he was and she told me with the most flat affect that Caucasian boys don\u2019t do as well in the NICU as well as other babies do. Then goes on to tell me they call it \u201cwhimpy white boy syndome\u201d. I wanted to knock the girls lights out. I called the charge nurse and requested she not come near me again. \n\nWhen a mother is panicking, especially during pregnancy when you\u2019re feeling powerless\u2026there is nothing more frustrating than a complete idiot who has no bedside manner. I\u2019ve been a nurse for a long time. A lot of these people are really good in school and really terrible at shutting up.. I\u2019m sorry.", "Jesus, NTA. Why didn\u2019t the OBGYN kick her out after she *laughed at your symptoms*? Then implying that your baby was going to DIE? You probably could have decked the girl and you still wouldn\u2019t be the asshole. If anything, you taught her a great lesson: maybe she should look into a different line of work.", "NTA at all, she should have learnt the appropriate bedside manner before coming in to your appointment\n\nyour OBGYN is also partly the AH as\n\n1. she should have briefed the student before your appointment and explained what is appropriate.\n2. she should have asked for your persmission before allowing the student to stay.\n\nedit: grammar", "NTA, this is her learning experience.

This is her lesson for the rest of her career.", "NTA 1000000000%. \nShe laughed about a stillbirth in a professional setting in front of a pregnant woman who was describing a pregnancy complication that has her worried? Who would ever call you TA?  \nI\u2019m also 10000% sure you have helped improve her bedside manner by asking her to leave. I don\u2019t think she will ever do it again. Being young is no excuse for being awful. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened OP. Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy and birth!", "NTA at all. I\u2019m very disappointed that your regular doctor didn\u2019t throw that student out. That was an absolutely disgusting thing for her to say.", "NTA\n\nOf course a student midwife needs to learn.  Among other things they need to learn is how to behave in front of a patient.  I hope you're OK.", "NTA, if she can't shut her trap, she is not entitled to learning opportunities. Having tact is also a part of her training and until she lerns it she needn't be in any appointments.\n\nEdit to clarify", "NTA\n\nStudents need opportunities to learn, that's true.....but not at the expense of YOUR comfort.", "NTA. This actually tells me that she isn\u2019t fit to work as a OB & should be in another part of the hospital training if she thinks pregnancy pain is funny or that allowing thoughts like that to even pop in by simply hearing about pain shows her mind set while learning but would be suited to other parts of hospital where it\u2019s viable for her to understand someone\u2019s pain & keep her thoughts to herself. This is a learning day she won\u2019t forget & a good learner she learned about what not to do & that apologizes don\u2019t change fact or always fix things. Good luck through rest of pregnancy op", "NTA. I\u2019d be horrified if someone I was supervising said something so awful. That\u2019s the type of comment I\u2019d report to their educational program. If it\u2019s a one-off they may get cautioned, but if it\u2019s a pattern they\u2019re not suited to healthcare. \n\n\nHope everything is okay with you and your baby and good luck with the birth and parenthood x", "NTA and your mother is being ridiculous. You can't train a bedside manner onto someone who laughs at pain and gets excited by the idea of... well, you know. The doctor owes you an apology for not asking your permission for that student's presence firstly, and secondly for subjecting any patient to someone so callous and unqualified. \n\nHonestly, I hope that girl is kicked out of the midwife program. She has the wrong temperament.", "NTA. You are the patient and your health and comfort are the priority. You were gracious enough to allow her to sit in (even though, like you said, you should have been asked, not told,) and she blew her opportunity. You don\u2019t owe her a chance to learn. You handle that perfectly and hopefully she got a stern warning from the doc after you left.", "NTA, and being thrown out of the room for making stupid insensitive comments is an excellent, time-honored learning opportunity that the student has now experienced.", "NTA\nYes she needs to learn. She learnt a lesson.\nAnd you need to feel comfortable in your appointment.\nYour actions achieved both, good on you for sticking up for yourself.", "NTA.... I'm not a midwife or training to be and I know not say something like that. It's who she is... She won't be in the field very long.", "Hard NTA. There are some things you NEVER say at, to or in front of a pregnant woman and what she said is one of them. And the laughing? Maybe nerves, maybe just immaturity. No matter what it does not sound like the student midwife has the maturity to be in an appointment at this stage.\n\nNever feel bad for standing up for your needs in a medical appointment. This WAS a learning opportunity for her and had you not stood up for yourself she wouldn't have learned it. Sometimes we learn through mistakes and your \"get out!\" was likely the smack upside the head that she needed in order to behave in a more professional manner. Chances are your OB ripped her a new one which was also appropriate given the situation.", "NTA. HIGHLY unprofessional. If she can't filter herself then maybe she shouldn't be in that line of work. The last thing an already stressed mother-to-be needs is more stress. That kind of behavior is unacceptable for someone in her field. Newbie or not. She isn't a child, she's a fully grown adult. Completely her fault and not yours.", "NTA. I was getting a pap smear done, and my male doctor waved in several medical students right before we started and I had no time to protest. I wish I\u2019d complained, as it was extremely upsetting. Never feel bad advocating for yourself in a medical setting, and especially not after the student midwife said. Hoping you have a safe delivery.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m in the medical field (assistant) I might be studying to be a mid wife.\nThat student has no empathy. She\u2019s old enough to shut her mouth and think before she speaks. What \u201clearning opportunity\u201d? There was no opportunity to learn because her brain didn\u2019t want to.\n\nI can tell this isn\u2019t the first rodeo due to the Dr.\u2018s reaction. Instead of being shocked at her, she glared her. I\u2019m happy you stood up for yourself. I hope you and your baby will be fine \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. This is just bonkers.... you were patient and flexible, but the midwife-trainee was beyond out of line. Bedside manner is a little different than basic human decency, but she exhibited neither.", "NTA! Unsure how it works in the US but in the UK anytime I\u2019ve been seen by a doctor/dentist/midwife and there\u2019s been a trainee the first thing they\u2019ve done is made an introduction and asked for permission for them to either sit in or conduct the examination.\nThat young lass obviously has a lot more learning to do before they let her in a room with patients.", "NTA. Oh, I think you gave that student midwife an *excellent* lesson on bedside manner, one she will hopefully learn from going forward.", "NTA. Being asked to leave IS the learning opportunity: if she cannot control her inappropriate laughter and comments, she will not get very far in a field that requires complete trust and vulnerability from patients. Having this smoothed over, while you left in tears, is the last thing she needs. And either way: your feelings as the patient receiving care trump those of the trainee in your appointment any day.", "Absolutely NTA. It's fine that they wanted her to sit in. It's not okay that she was completely rude and inappropriate. It's *absolutely unacceptable* that she couldn't keep her inappropriate thoughts to herself and made an already stressful situation worse.\n\nThe *minute* she laughed she should have been sent out of the room. That she was allowed to remain and become worse? That's on your midwife.", "NTA.  She was wildly inappropriate.", "NTA. You have a right to choose your healthcare practitioners. I agree that your doctor should have asked first; I\u2019ve had med students/nursing students that were shadowing in my appointments before, but the doctor or NP always asked if I was okay with them being in the room. \n\nHer bedside manner was atrocious and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really covered by \u201cstill learning\u201d. Most likely your doctor was just trying to excuse her behavior to \u201cclose\u201d that incident and move on with the appointment.", "NTA. You allowed her to stay and learn until she was incredibly unprofessional. People change fully trained drs due to things like this, and even that isn't an overreaction.", "NTA. SO MUCH NTA. \n\nI ALWAYS say yes to med students or trainee nurses or whatever because I believe in learning.\nI have never been treated poorly even when I became extremely distressed in an appointment.\nHad I been I would have done the same as you.", "NTA. She learned. She learned what not to do. To be respectful. Hopefully she learns that lesson.", "NTA. You did give her a learning opportunity - how to behave professionally when dealing with a patient.", "NTA\n\nI would react the same if I got a medical person there who is new and didn\u2019t know when to shut the mouth. Maybe she is knew but come on!?! Who wants someone in the room and mumble something about \u201estillbirth\u201c while pregnant with the first child and has pain?!", "NTA. You didn\u2019t deny her a learning opportunity, she still learnt some things, just not what she was expecting.", "NTA. I've kicked out a student midwife before. I am consultant-led due to mental health issues (PTSD from a very serious SA) and elected for a c section to avoid having people all up in my business as I wasn't sure how I would react to it (I can get really aggressive if I feel threatened or under pressure which probably wouldn't be good for anyone during labour). \n\nIn one of my later midwife appointments there was a student nurse and while I get that she just wanted to learn, she kept asking probing questions to the senior midwife about my medical file IN FRONT OF ME. Why is she having a c section? Oh what mental health problems allow an elective? Oh why does she have PTSD? Like do it when I'm out of the room sure but can we not debrief some teenager about my r*pe while I'm in the room? The senior midwife was trying to get her to stop but clearly this kid just lacked common sense. I've actually banned all student midwives from any appointments now (on my second pregnancy) as I'm not putting up with that again.", "NTA. Having the midwife there is fine. Her inability to be a silent observer was the real issue.", "NTA. I think you provided a very valuable learning opportunity for her to keep her mouth shut.", "NTA but your midwife is! \n\n\u201cThis is Trainee Midwife, she\u2019ll be sitting in on your appointment.\u201d\n\nVs\n\n\u201cThis is Trainee Midwife, do you mind if she sits in on your appointment?\u201d \n\nYou should\u2019ve been given an opportunity to refuse and your midwife should\u2019ve set her straight before it even got to you needing to kick her out.", "NTA.  That\u2019s a terrible thing to say, and she already had a warning when she laughed inappropriately.   She doesn\u2019t know as much as the professional and needs to learn by listening.  Also, I don\u2019t think the doctor should have been excusing her because she is young and learning.   A student midwife should already have had enough experience to know this was unacceptable.   Being 37 weeks pregnant is an anxious time without this experience.   All the best for the little one coming soon.  Edit to add that a nurse made a couple of stupid statements to me when I was bed bound with my son a few days old.   My husband went straight to the nurse\u2019s supervisor and told her to keep that guy away from me.   She checked with me  and confirmed that the nurse would not be near me or the baby again.  It\u2019s ok to stand up for yourself at this time.", "NTA. Personally, the moment she laughed at your pain, the Dr should have reprimanded her or asked her to go out.\n\nMy sources: Greys anatomy (the show, not the medical text book), Code black, chicago med, 911 etc. LOL", "NTA \n\nYou are a way better person than me....you were monumentaly patient and kind for hearing such a viticulture thing at such a stressful time in your life \n\nI would have looked her dead in the eye and said Really? I've never committed m\u00a5rd\u20acr before, but there's always a first time..... And by then I'm pretty sure my SO would have been restraining me.\n\nAll the best to you and your new family. And F that tact less girl", "NTA. That was her learning opportunity. She learnt that she needs to develop a filter so she can speak more sensitively with patients.", "Wth\n Her comment was so beyond the pale, idk why even to say. Like who SAYS that to a pregnant woman?!! How can something like that just slip out. This is not about a learning curve. No learning curve is necessary for such a basic thing like implying a still birth to a pregnant woman. I can't understand your mother's thought process here. As for that trainee midwife, there is something seriously wrong with her if things like THAT just slip out. It's just insane. \n\nNTA at all.\n\nAlso, I hope you and the baby are alright and safe and that the pain was nothing consequential. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, she was way out of line, you need to file a complaint with your clinic about her as well.  Both the laughing at your complications and then insinuating that it will be a still birth.  She is not cut out for this type of work.", "IMHO, U R NTA. Yikes! That sounds rough, not cool at all. I suggest standing UR ground, U deserve respect & consideration too. No need for guilt, U did nothing wrong. Hope things get better, OK?", "NTA. There was absolutely no reason for her to make the comment about a still birth. Its was totally unnacceptable  and unwarranted.", "NTA, OP, and if I were you I'd be having a frank discussion with your mother about taking the side of a stranger over you when you're clearly very vulnerable and need your mother's support.", "NTA, almost N A H. She's obviously a very new student or she wouldn't make such rookie mistakes. You're the patient, the client, the customer, the one this is all for, and in this case, you absolutely have the right to demand a comfortable environment. She will definitely learn from this experience. Not all lessons are happy ones, and I doubt very much she'll control her reactions better in the future.

Yeah it's uncomfortable, but they've got to learn right?

During my second pregnancy all the experienced doctors refused to believe what they were seeing on the echo (my placenta was very weird and they'd never seen anything like it) and it took a freshly graduated doctor to convince everyone that their eyes were not deceiving them and that they were indeed looking at a once in a lifetime anomaly.

Your job is to keep calm and have the baby. You had absolutely no obligation to allow her in the room to begin with but mentioning stillbirth to a woman who's near delivery is beyond the pal. Kicking her out is the only thing that might make her realize she needs to think before she speaks, that she's talking to patients and words she uses can create distress.", "NTA\n\nThat midwife shouldn't be let anywhere near children. Ever\n\nWe've just had a recent event in the uk where a midwife/nurse was responsible for murdering babies. But no one ever saw it coming because she was \"completely normal\".

Yes they have to learn somehow but ours were absolutely professional.\n\nRandom outbursts is just....weird.", "NTA. she got herself kicked out of your appointment. I am not a midwife, nor am I training to be a midwife. HOWEVER, I already know not to do what she did. \n\nThat\u2019s not something that needs to be taught. And if it does, maybe midwifery isn\u2019t for her.", "NTA, also the doctor should have asked her to leave before you even mentioned it, but sounds like the doctor is TA for not really being present and paying attention to what the student was saying and doing.", "You are NTA.  She should have kept her mouth shut.   I will say though, I had an IUD inserted and there was a resident present and they did not ask me beforehand. I had two doctors, a nurse, my 3 year old and me crammed into a tiny room for my IUD procedure.  That procedure is uncomfortable anyway, and they didn\u2019t ask.  To the residents credit, she kept her mouth shut and observed the procedure.  It was a long 30 minutes.", "You did teach her. Her manners where horrible. You don't need to be a trained midwife to know that.", "NTA..  you taught her a really important lesson to engage brain before letting mouth run off...  guess the Ob will be teaching her another lesson once she gets back in the room..", "NTA, she is young and learning but laughing at a patient who is telling the doctor about the pain they are in is definitely not excusable and how is she gonna cope seeing people in labour.", "Nta student just learned a valuable lesson about bedside manner.", "NTA WHAT THE FUCK", "NTA.  You weren't unfair at all.  Besides which, the student midwife DID have a learning opportunity.  Hopefully, what they will learn from this is to watch their damn mouth.", "And in another installment of things that never happened....", "The most valuable lesson any medical professional can learn, I'd say.", "Exactly. She learned one of the most important lessons a medical professional can learn, that being that you *really* need to make sure your more morbid thoughts *stay* thoughts.", "What is it with nurses and talking about wimpy white boy syndrome?\n\nWhen I was 28 weeks pregnant with my son, I slipped and fell on a patch of ice.

Shot of steroids for lung development and to help with \u201cwimpy white boy syndrome.\u201d\n\nI ended up going to just shy of 39 weeks, so it was all fine, but that discussion definitely sticks out.

My OB office will ask flat out \u201cdo you mind if a student joins us today for your appointment \u201c before the doctor comes in the room. I have never ever had a student join who was so poorly behaved.  They mostly are quiet in the corner watching, or helping with something simple like finding the heartbeat on the Doppler.", "Agreed, she DID get a learning opportunity and hopefully it won't happen again.\n\nNTA", "Same. Also, there should have been an apology and reassurance from that doctor, not a guilt-trip that OP should have put up with the student's inappropriate outbursts because \"she's learning\". \n\nLearning not to do damage - psychological as well as physical - is the most important first step in becoming a medical practitioner, and if she can't be trusted with that then she isn't ready to be in the room with a real patient.", "Yes! You absolutely gave her a learning opportunity. The opportunity to learn how to shut her mouth and not blurt out every hurtful, unsubstantiated thing that enters her little brain.

When I was lying on the table having an ultrasound on my lower belly for a possible ovary cyst.. the ultrasound tech ( male) reacted to whatever he saw and asked \"do you have children?\".
