I don't invite people over very often and when I date it's not a point of tension because they're usually okay with doing other stuff. it's always a problem with guys who use my home as an escape from theirs. but if they're genuinely interested in me and spending time with me, they try to find and suggest other activities for us to do (in addition to the stuff that I suggest). sometimes we don't do anything, we just hang out in the living room and talk or read together. \n\nnot saying that this is what your boyfriend is doing (escaping to your place), but am saying that plenty of people would love to spend time with you without a screen being the main focus.", "NTA.

Either that means he spends less time at your house (doesn't stay long enough to get bored) or he upgrades his data plan, or he learns the joys off offline gaming (unless he's playing an MMO or live service game most consoles don't require internet to function). \n\nHowever given that this is going to be an ongoing situation with no foreseeable end in sight I think it's worth sitting down and having an adult conversation about this when you're both calm and in a reasonably good mood. There are ways to compromise here that don't involve you getting internet, but they should start with you sitting him down and telling him \"I'm not getting internet, you're not going to be able to convince me to get internet, knowing this are there other ways you can feel less bored during the times we're not doing a joint activity?\"\n\nAlso worth considering: Are there ways he attempts to accommodate you when you're visiting his space? If no, this might be a good time to bring that up as well. \n\nLike you're not the asshole but you both could stand to communicate a little better about this. I think discussing it in concrete \"here's what will and will not happen\" terms is probably better than having the same argument over and over.

You'd both be able to partake in your hobbies and because you would living together he'd have acces to the internet.\n\nI think you find your list of activities relaxing and he finds them stimulating. So at yours he spends the weekend constantly engaged and active and is looking for something where he can turn his brain off. It also seems like your a little bored at his so maybe you can take some transportable crafts or maybe puzzles", "To jump on to the smart tv suggestion, another option would be maybe a projector? They make very small ones that can hook up to a phone and project onto an open wall. If that's something that might be a bit cheaper than a TV. Then as AdGroundbreaking said, he could pre-download some things to watch. \n\nI see what you mean about being in a tricky spot but it would be strangely easier if you were actually living together. Because then presumably you would be compromising about things like having a TV/internet, which you don't need or want when it's just you. \n\nWould he be willing to go half-and-half on something like a TV purchase? I get not wanting to buy a whole internet package since that's a recurring expense, not just a one-time thing.

Tell him to get a Switch with games he can play offline, for real. he's a grown-up he can, and should be able to entertain himself.

IT SOUNDS AMAZING TBH!  However, if your downtime things are not his thing then he is maybe not a great fit for long weekends at yours... Maybe long weekends need to be at his if he needs his stuff... and. you sound liek. you get bored but are willing to put up and participate with his stuff at his and that's not reciprocal.  So until if/when you decide to cohabitate and he can pay for his internet and can set up his rig, maybe his place is the compromise.

I personally wouldn't rent or buy a property without first checking what kind of internet access I could have there (in the country I live in now, most apartment buildings are served by a single provider, so what you get is determined by the building you live in; I'd reject somewhere that only had DSL access even if everything else about it was satisfactory).\n\nIn your case though, your partner's just bored, and nobody ever died of boredom.
