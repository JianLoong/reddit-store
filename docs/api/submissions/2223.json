Shredding the dress of the woman who broke up his parent\u2019s marriage when he\u2019s sixteen is one thing. Doing the same thing to his soon-to-be stepdaughter-in-law (who he doesn\u2019t even care about) would be something else entirely. \n\nBy all means get the dress back\u2026 but you didn\u2019t need to go into details. You could have said \u201cHey, having the dress not in my home has caused me some surprising anxiety. I need to get it back so I can sleep at night.\u201d Problem solved. \n\nInstead, you implied that her husband was somehow a danger to your dress. That was unnecessary.", "Hmm.\n\n- MIL and DIL have a so/so relationship \n- Son and stepdad don't get along/stepdad doesn't care for DIL\n- MIL has money\n- MIL \"cold\" or has some sort of anxiety \n- WEDDINGS!/Wedding dress involved\n\nThis sounds extremely familiar. . .", "NTA.

Your anxiety is understandable, especially given the time and cost associated with getting a wedding dress.   Hearing him talk about it without any evidence of remorse could make you worry.  \nWith that said, the circumstances were way different in her husband's previous situation (and obviously he was an AH then but that's not the current issue), he was a teenager, and it was decades ago--It's not surprising that MIL would have an issue with any suggestion on your part that he might do something to your dress, it does suggest that you see him as unstable or excessively vindictive.", "NTA\n\nHe has history of destroying others property. You store it in your home or somewhere safe. With MIL, it will not be safe.", "NAH.\n\nLook, I can understand a kid/ teen doing so k thing malicious like that to the dress in the circumstances. You forget that they had an affair. \n\nAs shitty as the action was, it had a reason and I doubt your dress is in danger but if you want it at home that's your choice.", "YTA, he did it when he was a child in an act of spite towards the woman that ruined his family.", "NTA. A wedding dress is an expensive and important thing. Joking about destroying one in the past is a psycho thing.", "NTA with how cold she is to you why did you leave it over there in the first place? Regardless no keep that very expensive dress safe.", "NTA\n\nIf he'd shown even a slight hint of feeling bad over the destroyed dress, it'd be a different answer.

Also, being a teenager, a mama's boy as you said, and having your dad cheat on your mom AND marry the woman he cheated with is huge.
