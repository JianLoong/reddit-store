It's huge though and takes up a lot of space. MIL said we could keep it at her house if we wanted as her house is huge and it's just the two of them. I was grateful as we are in a tiny apartment.

He is a huge mama's boy and admitted he has a bad temper, so he destroyed the dress the night before the wedding. i was in shock but he laughed it off like it was normal.

She seemed confused so I told her it is going to give me too much anxiety now and I can't trust her husband. I said I know her husband isn't crazy about us and it's going to drive me crazy.\n\nMIL got mad and said I was accusing him of being phsyco and he doesn't care about me one way or the other.

Shredding the dress of the woman who broke up his parent\u2019s marriage when he\u2019s sixteen is one thing.

That was unnecessary.", "Hmm.\n\n- MIL and DIL have a so/so relationship \n- Son and stepdad don't get along/stepdad doesn't care for DIL\n- MIL has money\n- MIL \"cold\" or has some sort of anxiety \n- WEDDINGS!/Wedding dress involved\n\nThis sounds extremely familiar. . .", "NTA.

Your anxiety is understandable, especially given the time and cost associated with getting a wedding dress.   Hearing him talk about it without any evidence of remorse could make you worry.  \nWith that said, the circumstances were way different in her husband's previous situation (and obviously he was an AH then but that's not the current issue), he was a teenager, and it was decades ago--It's not surprising that MIL would have an issue with any suggestion on your part that he might do something to your dress, it does suggest that you see him as unstable or excessively vindictive.", "NTA\n\nHe has history of destroying others property. You store it in your home or somewhere safe. With MIL, it will not be safe.", "NAH.\n\nLook, I can understand a kid/ teen doing so k thing malicious like that to the dress in the circumstances.

Regardless no keep that very expensive dress safe.", "NTA\n\nIf he'd shown even a slight hint of feeling bad over the destroyed dress, it'd be a different answer.
