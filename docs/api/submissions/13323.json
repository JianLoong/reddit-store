TLDR version at the bottom\n\nContext: I'm an Asian (33M) and also the eldest son in my family with 2 siblings (A brother and a sister). Filial piety is sort of a big thing in my culture and parents usually expect their kids to take care of them when they get older.\n\nI'm currently staying in a place belonging to my grandmother (she's staying with my aunt) with my parents. My dad basically lost everything from failed businesses, to gambling and the stock market collapse. So we had a rather traumatic childhood and had to move in to the current house around 15 years ago as we didn't have anywhere to stay. Currently, my sister is in another country permanently and my brother is staying with his gf.\n\nI bought a house back in 2020 and now that it's getting ready, I'm finding myself in a tough spot. It's a landed house with 4 rooms which can easily fit a family of 5-6.\n\nIn the earlier days before I bought my house, my mum has always mentioned to me that she does not want to stay with any of us kids because she did not want to trouble us. So to my surprise, when I brought her to see the show unit before purchasing the house, she instantly fell in love and said that she wanted to move in as well. \n\nNow here's the start of all my troubles. I have a gf of 6 years and when this was first mentioned my gf did not voice out any explicit objection to the idea. I did not thought much about it back then because it didn't felt like a deal breaker for her. Also because I DO like the idea of having my parents around as we can take care of each other as a family. \n\nMy gf has been bringing up this issue more frequently which has caused a strain in our relationship. Her friends recently moved in to their own place and I know that in a way, she is envious of the fact that they get a place to themselves. She's been bringing up stories about how she's heard many of her friends living together with their parents that ended up having alot of issues. \n\nMy gf has alot of unresolved child hood trauma (she did not have a good childhood) and is not on speaking terms with her father. Her mum passed away a few years ago but she was also not on speaking terms with her when she passed. However, she cares alot for my parents and will always go out of her way to take care of them. My parents in return also adores her and have asked me to marry her. Therefore, her concern definitely stems from the fear and trauma of her childhood because she also mentioned before that she never had a place of her own since young (she's staying with her family and shares a room with her sister)\n\nSo WIBTA if I told my parents they cannot move in with me to my new house when the time comes?\n\nTLDR version: bought a house to live with my partner. My parents decided that they want to live in my new house together. Partner does not want to stay with my parents.

Therefore it's 100% your decision who lives there. Not your parent's decision.", "YWNBTA\n\nI understand it's part of your culture, and it's nice for family to have each other's backs and take care of on another, but I believe you can do this other ways than living together.\n\nI could not imagine living with my in-laws or my own parents. Being married means you're starting your own family, and you need time together and space to be a couple.\n\nIf your parents moved in, would they be in their own in-law suite or would you be sharing the entire house?\n\nThis would be a huge no for me if I had to share the entire house with my in-laws. I simply would not be able to be myself in my own home.", "NTA\n\nIf your girlfriend is not of your culture, she will absolutely not understand wanting to allow your parents to move in with you.

Breaking of deep-seeded cultural norms, when that expectation is there, can be so taxing. You're NTA, BUT I have a feeling what you want, and are considering, may not be what pans out. Is the house you've bought a duel venture with your current GF, or is this your house?", "I think as of right now this is a NAH.  You like living extended-family style with your folks.  She doesn't care for the idea.  Neither of you are evil for having these feelings and preferences.  Both of you should have bought them up to one another before you were in the process of closing on a house rather than making assumptions.\n\nUltimately this may be a dealbreaker for the relationship, but nobody's really an asshole yet.", "Nta but definitely have a good clear conversation with your gf about this, even if it's just to clarify you're both still on the same page.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think your gf is the asshole because she hasn\u2019t come right out and said she doesn\u2019t want them to move in with you. She\u2019s being passive aggressive about it. But doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s a dealbreaker for her", "Info: What is it that you want? I know your mother wants to live with you, and your girlfriend doesn\u2019t want that, but what is your preference? And how important to you is that preference?  YWNBTA for wanting to live on your own, but it\u2019s not clear to me if that is what you want.", "I see where the cultural pressure would make you feel like an AH; however, it's well known that living with in-laws will add additional stressors to your relationship. It can either make or break it. Go with what you think is best for everyone involved", "Info: \n\nWhy did you buy such a large house that took three years to complete? It would seem you did that to house your parents especially as your mom loved the design. I completely understand your gf not wanting to live with your parents because no one likes being outnumbered in their own house. Can your parents not stay in the current house at this point? I don't know how to judge this. Are your parents completely broke? Did they help you with school? Have you been living with them for most of your life?", "It doesn't sound like OP is opposed to living with his family though. If the gf didn't have an issue with it, would he want them to move in? Also his mom said she doesn't want to burden them, she always wanted to live with the kids. \n\nOP, you should decide what you want. Your gf may compromise but that could cause friction and resentment later on. On the other hand, as her values change naturally as she ages, she may see living with them as a pro instead of a con. \n\nAnyway, NAH, you, your partner and your mom seem really nice. Your mom wouldn't be upset at you for this, it's kind of you to try to be considerate toward everyone. I would also consider keeping the house for yourself for a few years then taking in your mom when she's older and less capable but up keeping visits to maintain the relationship. If you do this, def be transparent with your partner though. If it is trauma related, she's gotta work on it at her own pace and making the decision without including her would be shitty", "So, as soon as he marries, he can listen to his then-wife and kick his parents out? This reasoning is so outdated. The parents have a roof over their head, and seem to be of sound mind and body. They are adults, and can fend for themselves. He should prioritize his new family, not his old one.", "Thank you for your salient criticism.  Too bad that your opinion can't stand on it's own merits.  You find it necessary to criticize another.   Maybe the competition of ideas is less important to you than criticizing others.   Best wishes."]}
