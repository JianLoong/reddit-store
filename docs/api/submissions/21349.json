Or that that boy need therapy and his father need to step up and help him?\n\n>Why are you talking as if the kids are just hers ? Also why would you ever think it\u2019s acceptable to take a fathers kid from him? You are risking kidnapping charges.\n\nAbout this you are partially right.\nThe way I phrased it was really bad and when I wrote it I was thinking only at her side of the problem (and I'm in the wrong for this), but have I ever spoken of kidnapping or to prevent his father to see his children?\n\nLike I've written, for me its that If the bf and his ex dont help his son and he continues to make her life hell, leaving can be a solution. \n\nBut in the end the OP seems to be a tough one and also smart, so I dont think that will ever happen.\n\nAnd you are free to think I'm a bad person for my opinion about the situation, but everyone has their own thought about OP's problem and I'm not here saying I'm right or wrong.\nSo, sorry for the long rant \ud83d\ude05", "Because ss mom made her own claims again my bf. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It does seem like the mother could be behind what the stepson accused op of there was on a while back where a daughter did it her mums boyfriend and turns it out her dad told her to do it", "What could be worst than this so that the court didn\u2019t give you full custody? What is your custody arrangements? This kid obviously needs protection and help. \n\nAlso I just saw that he doesn\u2019t talked to the person he sees. I was wondering have you ever tried play therapy? That can do wonders.", "NTA.  Even though your stepson is a child, he actually LIED TO THE POLICE and accused you of sexual abuse.  \n\nThat's a deal stopper.  That kid shouldn't get one red cent from you.", "NTA and I'd never ever let him in my house again.\n\nHe doesn't deserve your money, and you don't deserve family that doesn't have your back.", "Nta, is he allowed in the house now.  He shouldn't be", "Does your stepson have to visit you? I think he just wants to make sure to stay at his mom full time. I am kind of sorry for you and also your stepson, cause he is going far for it. As I assume.\n\nNTA BTW.", ">That family member belittled me, called me every name in the book, screamed bloody murder at me. I simply said \u201cif you have the money you can give him it for college because I am not at all. He doesn\u2019t deserve the money after everything he has put me through.\u201d\n\nNTA - You had a wonderful come back for the family member. Of course the answer was they wouldn't fund him either. I agree the SS has burnt a lot of bridges with you and I'd have a hard time doing anything for him. But I would suggest to his father that he get some counseling for his anger. \n\nI don't know what I'd do, but I wouldn't want to live in the same house as the stepson. Getting arrested and interrogated by the police is pretty much a deal breaker for me.", "Could you use some of the money for more expensive avenues of therapy that might not normally be possible? Something like art therapy, for example. Things that might help him open up about what may have happened.", "I wouldn\u2019t spend a penny on that garbage. It\u2019s the parents responsability.", "At a state school, if they are lucky enough to live in commuting distance and at home, it's about two-ish years of schooling right now. But beyond that, OP's kids are 1 and 5 - it has time to grow.", "You do realize only a few US states still recognize common law marriage, right?", "You do realize that laws have nothing to do with morality right? Just because it is legal or illegal does not mean it right or wrong.\n\nThe world as a whole recognizes common law marrage,. The relationship is 8years with 2 kids. You telling me there is a completely different moral standard if they were married? what if they got married by a churge and not legally? different standard of morals?\n\nEdit: In case anyone is interested..11 state recognize common law marriges.", "He tried, but the ex lied to the courts.", "Either way, she has no obligation to a child who tried to put her in jail", "You're money your choice. \nCould you help out them if they needed it sure but not mandatory but after them doing all that absolutely not.", "Does the family member and extended family know what your stepson has done to you? he could\u2019ve landed you in jail and ruined your chance of future work. Do they not realise how that itself is a reason not to cover his education? Also is he getting help? he sounds dangerous and is never trust this kid considering the extremes he\u2019s gone to get you out of his life. I hope your partner is getting him help!", "I wouldn't give him any money and I would never be alone with him at all. You don't want him making another accusation against you. Tell any person that comes at you that they should give him the money since they are so concerned. That money is for your future and retirement. If they curse at you curse right back. Yeah I can curse also, no reason to take any abuse from anyone.", "NTA, but that poor child.", "NTA! They\u2019re insane to think you would give him anything after what he did. Also he\u2019s your stepson, he has his own parents who should do this for him. He\u2019s not family, family doesn\u2019t make vile false accusations at each other. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through this", "NTA\n\n If i were you i wouldn't even let him set foot in my house, never mind take something from my kids and give it to him. Hell no.", "NTA.  He fraudulently caused you to be arrested.  No money for him.", "NTA", "NTA after the malicious things he did to  you, he does not deserve it. You\u2019re under no obligation to give him your money.  Don\u2019t even THINK about it.", "> What could be worst than this so that the court didn\u2019t give you full custody?\n\nThe court system favoring the mother despite Soviet style red flags? Well I'd be shocked! Shocked I tell ya! /s."]}
