They've been upsetting you for a while, now.", "Boomer here, NTA, I\u2019d say boomers would tend to be more into privacy then normal. So they are probably an exception. I can see if you are working in the garage and the neighbor in the driveway saying hello, but not walking into the garage, and walking into the anyone walking into my backyard with out being invited would get them hurt.", "NTA at all. They have no boundaries and are probably used to it. He got upset because no one has ever called him out on it and so he thinks you're an AH for being rude to him, even though it wasn't rude! \n\nMy friend's neighbor is like that. She will go so far as to come over and water their lawn when she feels like the grass is underwatered. She would come over and inspect their vegetable garden and when she felt it wasn't doing well, she waited for them to be in the backyard and sped over to tell them they were doing a poor job of raising their vegetable plants. The lady is 60+. My friend has no idea how to tell her to stop and they can't put up a fence because it's HOA.", "Just from reading the title, no, you are not the asshole. It's your house, you can decide whether you want them on your property or not. I also believe you can do something legally about it as it could be considered trespassing (maybe? I'm not a big expert on law stuff). It seems to me that they just think they're entitled.", "NTA  \n\nI don't know if it's generational or not, but this boomer would never just walk onto someone else's property without phoning  first (or texting)        If I had something to tell or ask my neighbor I might stand at the property line and call out to them if I could see them, like if they were visible in the backyard.      It would begin with an apology, like *I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I wanted to ask you something...*   \n\nMaybe the previous tenants and your neighbors had that sort of relationship, but it's rude of them to  assume that you would want that  level of friendship where you just walk into someone else's space and start talking. \n\nI'm sure they're curious about you and eager to get  to know you.  \n\nJust like with any relationship you have to set boundaries; hopefully without hurting their feelings.    You should be very clear about what you expect of them.   Would they be okay with you just walking into their home?   Doubtful.   They're making you feel uncomfortable and invaded.    \n   \n\nI hope you don't have to put up an actual fence between the properties to keep them out.\nIt's hard to believe they couldn't understand that.     \n\nYoung or old, some people are just dim.", "NTA. He might have just been embarrassed because he didn't realize how seriously you took your personal space. Different parts of the country have different views on the matter so he might have just not known.", "NTA. I don't see this has anything to do with being a \"boomer.\" It is rude to just walk over like that. Doesn't sound like there's a way to fence it off. So keep telling them no if it keeps on happening.", "NAH. It does sound like they're genuinely just trying to be good friendly neighbors and make you feel welcome and like you're part of the neighborhood. To an extent I wish more people were still like that.\n\nAt the same time it's totally fine to have boundaries and just ask that they knock first or whatever. Especially when you're in your back yard, that's much more a private space. Working in your garage with the garage door open is somewhat of an invitation to say hi, or at least not unreasonable to see it as one. Sitting in your back yard is not.\n\nMaybe bake them some lemon bars or something and try and clear the air, it sounds like you both just want to be good neighbors to each other and have different ideas of what that means.", "Well, you're NTA for wanting privacy, but you are creating problems for yourself.  There's no perfect solution here, but there is a choice that will lead to worse problems and that's the choice you're making.\n\nThis has nothing to do with generational characteristics.  It's that some people are more social than others.  I'm probably around your age and in my situation, it's the Gen. Z students who are constantly ringing the doorbell.  \n\nI know advice columnists usually tell us to be straightforward, and we should be able to say \"please don't come on to my property whenever,\" but unfortunately, it is rude to say that.  Most people are going to be offended.  You do not want to \\*\\*\\*\\* off your neighbors.  These are the people who will let you use their shower or washing machine when yours is broken.  They'll call the police if they see a stranger prowling around the house while you're on vacation.  They'll lend you expensive tools when you need to unblock/fix something.  They'll tell the Dateline reporter that you're so nice if you're ever accused of anything. \n\nIt's probably too late now but I would avoid ever saying anything like that again.  There are other ways to demonstrate that we want to be alone.  Talk about how great it is to get alone time after the stress of work.  Say \"hi\" politely, engage in a couple of sentences of small talk, and then say \"welp, better get back to it.\"  Have your wife tell them you have poor social skills so they think you can't help being awkward.  Pretend to be trying to meet a deadline for work.  This is exactly the kind of situation that little white lies are made for.\n\nI'd also make some kind of friendly gesture.  Wave when you see them, tell them their garden is looking great, take them a nice flower from the store that you don't \"need.\"  It'll be worth it.", "This is definitely a generational thing. I'm GenX and see both sides of this, NAH.", "NTA -but I am sure they are just being friendly. My parents live in a more longer-term neighborhood with neighbors that have been there for 20+ years. Not uncommon to walk up and say hello on someones property.  \n\nBut - that also means theyve had a few random neighbors who let their dogs run over, step into their property when not really welcome, or have had beef with a random neighbor.  \n\nThey probably just were thinking they were good nieghbors. But yeah- NTA for being like- hey thanks for being awesome. I don't like when people walk on my property without invitation. Makes me uncomfortable.", "NAH\n\nThis used to be a common feature of sit-coms like \"Home Improvement\".  Neighbors who are outside and can see you also outside may say hello and try to chat if they're friendly.  If you don't have a fence it can be pretty awkward for them to just pretend you're not there.\n\nBut... Reddit largely skews towards a younger audience that has never lived in a neighborhood where that was common behavior.  It's been slowly dying out for the last 50 years.\n\nYou were angry.  Your neighbor was shocked.  Both of you went on with your days without yelling or insults.  He was friendly, you pushed back against starting a friendship. NAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then you might move closer as the conversation goes on. If they needed to talk to you then they could have stayed on driveway at least. Unless it's something urgent.

Put a lock on the gate to the backyard, keeps out strangers too.  Install an alarm on your garage front, so when they walk into the garage it sounds off.  \n\nThis is vey off putting and makes it a great time to mention to ask them why they thought walking into your garage was a great idea.", "NTA, but please understand that when they were in your age position, it was still fairly common in society as a whole to walk up to a neighbor working in their garage, or in the backyard, just to say hi or discuss some more serious matter.\n\nI don't know that people were more friendly in those times, or more trusting because of whatever, or what has changed, but the customs and etiquette, perceived friendliness of others, 'home space standards' expanding to mean that the yard, garage threshold, or being unannounced (suprising someone?) is not viewed in the same way as it was many years ago.\n\nI don't think they mean anything 'wrong' by it or intend to bother you all, and they likely didn't feel like they were intruding, just being friendly neighbors. They may have some common interests, Can't say, not enough info.\n\nPerhaps their feelings were hurt and that may have put them off that time, which is sad. But by what you wrote, you meant no harm, and it is not your customs or ways to have neighbors stroll up (before announcing themselves?) into your yard or garage.\n\nA posible thing to do, is to ask to discuss with them, these things, and say you didn't intend to give offense but it's just not yall's way, or customs. I mean, I think you indicated you basically like them. Good luck.", "Sounds like a culture thing rather than an age thing. In some parts of the country, this is pretty normal. My mother grew up in a village where it was completely normal to appear at the back door of one of your neighbor's houses, or even walk in to their kitchen, if you wanted to chat to them.\n\nI don't think there's an asshole - I think there are differing cultural assumptions. You have now asked them not to do this. If they continue, they become assholes, but at this point, NAH.", "NTAH at all, you don't have to be a boomer to do this stuff.  When I lived in a housing area with homes nearby we had a young couple that would just walk into our fenced in yard and/or garage to do the same stuff.  I guess they were bored or something but totally inappropriate.", "Thank you for the perspective. I do see lot of fence suggestions but we won't be pursuing that route.", "My first thought was the neighbors had the kind of relationship with the old owners where this was ok and haven\u2019t fully realized that new neighbors are going to be different.

Thank you for the perspective.", "Thank you for the perspective, and agreed.", "You're correct \ud83d\ude04", "You're correct.", "I loved that show lol", "This is great advice, thank you.\n\nThe thing is I feel like there is a veil or layer going on with them. They are super nice but there is something going on there.. Maybe crazy religious or soemthing... I could perhaps be thinking about it to hard.\n\nExample.. We had lost power for 5 days. I ended up having to get a generator to run the basic stuff, fridges etc.\n\nOnly after they saw me firing up a generator did they say if we needed to store anything in their fridge (they have a generac) we could. Almost like they asked only after knowing the answer would be no.. if that's makes sense.\n\nExample two.. I complimented his lawn about a year in, asked how he kept it so nice. Almost immediately after he stopped doing his own lawn and hired a company to do it. It's just weird stuff like that.\n\nExample three.. One time after ringing the doorbell and I didn't answer, he went around into the backyard and I caught him looking into the windows.\n\nWe exchange Christmas gifts with all the neighbors in our block, and Chinese New Year gifts for the few that celebrate that, and I made sure to knock on each and every one of their doors and said if you need to plug in - Don't ask, just run the cable and plug it in.\n\nThat went a long way, I'm a big fan of doing the right thing, but I'm also a big fan of privacy.\n\nTldr: Great advice. Thank you. : )", "Maybe bring some homemade food over and have a good chat.", "This was my take on it also. \n\nI don\u2019t know where you live now but in the Midwest it is absolutely not that unusual to walk up into the yard of a neighbor you know to strike up a conversation (The alternative would be to stand in the street and shout your conversation at each other or wait for the homeowner to walk to the street to chat). It is also not that bizarre to poke your head in the side-door of a garage or walk in if the overhead is open to chat with a neighbor you\u2019re familiar with. I have a dog so my neighbors tend to not walk in my backyard but up to the fence and call out for me lol. I think this is just a bit of a clash of either regional or generational differences with no harm intended. NAH \n\nFyi, the universal symbol of wanting privacy while working in your garage would be to keep all the doors closed.", "I think it's worth paying attention to your gut feeling.  It's not necessarily right!  Maybe they're perfectly nice people but seem weird in the same way that you might seem weird to them (i.e., you're both from different generations and backgrounds).  But maybe there is something up with them.\n\nTo me the generator situation sounds pretty standard.  People often hate sharing certain things even if they don't have a body hidden in the fridge!  They probably felt obliged to offer but didn't want someone coming over randomly to get food or are planning to have the family over soon and weren't sure if your power would be on in time to clear their fridge.\n\nI'd also hate it if someone peered in my windows when I ignored the doorbell but again, there's a reasonable explanation.  Maybe they thought you were out but then heard/saw some sign of activity and wondered if someone had broken in.\n\nI'm not going to tell you to ignore your gut though.  Maybe observe the social niceties but continue to be alert.  The bottom line is that it's always best to be on friendly terms with neighbors.  If they are actually weirdos, you don't want to offend them because that's when the behavior could become a problem.  Good luck!"]}
