To add insult to injury, this was a week before my end of medical residency exam, so he couldn\u2019t just wait a week to break up. I earn more than him, but I do work a lot more hours and have a job with more responsibility (he works at the post office). When  I said he could have waited a week to break up after the final exam, he said my job wasn\u2019t more important than his so it would be equally hard for both. He accused me of being greedy and not paying for enough things for him when I could. For context, he lives in my house, I pay all the bills, it is March and I already  paid for 2 flights for him\u2026 I think he is entitled and sometimes it feels like he deliberately tries to undermine my confidence. I tell him that if I were to pay for more of his things, I would feel used. What I give him never seems to be enough. He is always so angry and bitter\u2026 It is strange, sometimes I even feel like he would prefer for things to go less well for me professionally, even though he benefits from my earnings. He says his friend\u2019s girlfriends pay for them all the time and that I am arrogant and not a generous person.
