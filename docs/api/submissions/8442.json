One of my friends is Muslim, and is very strict about everything, for example once one of her coworkers was smoking in the break room and she asked her to do it somewhere else, as it\u2019s against her religion. My friends wanted drinks, and I saw that my Muslim friend (I\u2019ll call her Fatima) looked to the ground and grimaced. When the waiter came I told him for just a few glasses of water, nothing else, and my friend interjected and asked for a beer, I stoped the waiter and told him no, just water. When he came back with the water, all my other friends piped up at me and started an argument about it. Fatima was being silent, but later told me she appreciated what I did. After dinner, my friends left me with the bill and drove home. So AITA?\n\n\nEdit: I should really add, these were my friends, not hers, they met her once and asked her to come.", "created_utc": 1674845018, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10msglx/aita_for_not_buying_a_drink_for_my_friends/", "score": 3532, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Fatima is going to have to learn to live in the world where people have different moral/religious codes from her own.  In trying to accomodate her, you denied someone else their liberty.  This should be talked about beforehand with the friends coming to some agreement and not forcing it on to the friend.", "YTA.    If Fatima isn't comfortable in social settings where others are drinking, she should stay out of them.   You are under no obligation to buy your friends anything, but you can't forbid them from ordering what they want.  That's unacceptable and very rude.    What if someone at the table was a vegetarian.  Should YOU not be allowed to order what you want, so they don't get offended.  It's a ridiculous premise.\n\nBut if you get to decide what I eat and drink, yes, you should pay. But I wouldn't have let you get away with it at the time, either.", "YTA - you're imposing religious beliefs on others and what's crazier is that they aren't yours. You might have been considerate to Fatima, but you were inconsiderate to your friends.\n\nI'm for not smoking in a break room because that's a health hazard and a public space, but alcoholic beverages don't magically end up in the mouth of a non-drinker.", "YTA \nAs a Muslim I have no issue being around people who drink and if I did I simply wouldn\u2019t accept invitations if there was going to be drinking involved. The only thing Fatima needed to do would ensure she paid for only her food as splitting the bill would mean she would indirectly pay for alcohol (which is not allowed). If there were expectations of no drinking, this should\u2019ve been made clear to your friends before the meal.", "That was such a weird thing for you to do. Just because Fatima doesn\u2019t drink doesn\u2019t mean that extends to anyone beyond Fatima just because she\u2019s present. It\u2019s not disrespectful of your friends to order a drink with Fatima there, either. It would be disrespectful if they bothered her about her choice, but otherwise to each their own. If she\u2019s uncomfortable in the situation, she can choose not to go. But she (or I should say YOU) have no choice over what others decide to order. \n\nI\u2019ve cut back on drinking for health reasons recently and still go hang out with my friends and don\u2019t expect them to change a thing about their own personal decisions. You control yourself and make decisions for yourself and otherwise mind your business.\n\nIn short, YTA and not the white knight you think you are.", "YTA - You are overbearing telling others what they cannot consume. No one asked you to buy them drinks and, per your comment, group members pay.", "YTA. I would never have dinner with you again if you told me what I couldn't eat and/or drink. Fatima can do whatever she wants with her body, but neither she nor you can dictate what I do with mine. If she can't stand to be around people who don't adhere to her beliefs then don't invite her out in a group.", "YTA. Smoking around someone indoors is one thing. Regardless of religion at play, secondhand smoke is an actual issue. Drinking a beer is another. They weren't asking/forcing Fatima to drink one. As long as they were of legal age, they had every right to enjoy a beer with their meal. If Fatima can't handle being exposed to someone having an alcoholic beverage, she probably shouldn't attend dinners out at restaurants that serve it.

Her religious beliefs are hers to deal with not the worlds.", "YTA\n\nIt's bad enough to force your own beliefs on other people, but you tried to force someone else's belief on other people.", "YTA, one person's preferences at a table don't get to determine other peoples.  Fatima is welcome not to drink as much as everyone else is welcome to drink.\n\nThe smoking is slightly different due to second hand smoke (if you're smoking indoors other people also have to breathe it in).", "YTA. What you did was wildly inappropriate and the title is misleading. Also she TA as well. You shouldn\u2019t force your beliefs on people and you definitely shouldn\u2019t try to force other peoples beliefs on the people smoking is one thing because Secondhand smoke exists. However if your friends want to drink alcohol you shouldn\u2019t tell the waiter no just waters. If she feels uncomfortable with people drinking alcohol then she should say something and if they still want to do it she should leave. If one of your friends wanted to eat something with pork in it are you gonna stop them because Muslims can\u2019t eat pork?", "YTA, and I know I'm in a position to say so because I am also a Muslim. Fatima should know better than to hang out with others who are drinking if she is so uncomfortable by it. And I most certainly would not impose my religion upon others who do not believe in it. It is not against our religion to be in the presence of people who are drinking or smoking. What is against our religion is forcing others to follow the same rules that we do. Apologise to your friends for your behaviour, and tell Fatima that if she doesn't like it, don't hang out at places or events where she knows damn well drinking is going to be involved.", "YTA. Fatima's religious choices should not dictate other people's choices. She doesn't have the right to put her beliefs on anyone, and neither do you on her behalf.", "YTA\n\nIf Fatima's religion prohibit alcohol, Fatima is free to not drink alcohol. Fatima is *not* free to decide what other people drink.\n\nReligion is like a penis. It ok to have one. It's ok to be proud of it. You can be pantless in your own home. But don't bring it out in public and don't force it on others", "YTA what a sjw. Fatima has a mouth. But most importantly youre an asshole for pushing someone else religious beliefs onto others. Same as if a christian is at the table and you had a Hindu friend, would you push your friend's hindu beliefs onto your Christian friend or Christian beliefs onto your Hindu friend. Which belief overrides which? You don't get to make that choice. Everyone is free to believe what they want to and do what they want to do as long as they're not forcing or harming others. But no, your belief that Fatimas beliefs comes first somehow over everyone else's autonomy is the most important. It was incredibly selfish of you.", "YTA. Don\u2019t order for people unless they ask. It\u2019s rude. And Fatima lives in a world with things like alcohol and smoking, she has to learn how to navigate it and find what works best for her.", "YTA, Fatima has previously spoken up for herself, she can do it again. You don\u2019t need to fight her battles. She was fine with being there and knew what would likely happen. She thanked you, but she likely would\u2019ve been fine as well.", "YTA\n\nShe is a muslim, and she thinks this means everyone she graces with her presence has to obey strict Islamic rules that she holds herself bound by? Further, *you* decided that *you* were going to enforce that belief on your friends by hijacking their drink orders?\n\n....wtf...", "YTA I am also a Muslim but I've never acted this way.

I respect their choice, they respect mine. You don\u2019t get to dictate what other people do just  because of one person\u2019s religious views.", "YTA \u2013 Religions are like penises. It's fine to have one. It's okay to be proud of it. But unless someone asks about it, you should keep it to yourself.", "YTA, it is her religion. She needs to live up to it\u2026but nobody else! You can\u2019t dictate what your friends consume or do. You are a massive TA here. Don\u2019t force religion on other people", "YTA.\n\nHer religion is not your friends' religion. They have every right to have a beer if they want.\n\nYou deserved to be stuck with the bill considering how eager you were to decide what everyone would be allowed to have. Since you planned and ordered for them, they rightfully assumed you'd be footing the bill.", "Yta\n\nYou have absolutely no say in what someone else drinks. And your friends' religious beliefs are for her. Not everyone else. She doesn't get to choose what others do either. \n\nIf I had any friend push their beliefs onto me. You can believe that we wouldn't stay friends for very long.", "YTA. As a Muslim woman, I don\u2019t care if people drink or not. But if I were that uncomfortable, I wouldn\u2019t go out to situations where people would most likely drink.", "YTA. Just because her religion doesn\u2019t allow her to do something doesn\u2019t mean she has a right to police everyone else. Sure, not smoking in the break room at work is one thing but not allowing anyone else alcohol because she doesn\u2019t drink? That\u2019s not okay. Her religion tells her what she can and can\u2019t do with her body, but not what everyone else can and can\u2019t do. It\u2019s unreasonable to force everyone else to adhere to her religion.", "YTA. Sorry not sorry but idgaf about the rules of somebody else\u2019s religion. I will not pressure them to do anything, I will not make fun of them for not doing something. But what they believe will have no control over me, nor should anyone let it.\n\nLike I *guess* if you\u2019re paying, as it\u2019s implied, your word is the final say about what comes to the table but\u2026.the reasoning is dumb imo.", "YTA and so is Fatima. You were trying to be considerate by thinking of her but she doesn\u2019t get to impose her beliefs on others. That isn\u2019t how it works.", "Yta\nFatima is also TA\n\nIt is not against Fatima's religion for you or your friends to drink. It is against her religion for her to drink.\n\nIt is not against Fatima's religion for other people to smoke, it is against her religion for her to smoke.\n\nShe needs to stop forcing her beliefs on others.", "YTA\n\nIf Fatima does not drink or smoke for religious reasons, then that's her right. However, neither she nor you have any right to force others to abstain.", "Seriously?  If I was with friends and ordered a beer, and one friend told the waiter/waitress not to give me one, I'd be pissed.

Weird to me these days)\n\nShe doesn't want to drink, she doesn't need to drink. Your friends want to have a drink, they can have a drink. Why force her personal mores on the rest of the group?\n\nWould you tell everyone else \"You can't order anything with pork?\" or if there was a vegetarian at the table \"No meat allowed?\"\n\nGoing to add: what you did was also a sure-fired way to make sure Fatima never got asked to be brought along by your friends.", "YTA - You don't get to make those kinds of decisions for others. You could have stood in solidarity with Fatima by not having a drink, maybe even piping up and saying \"Fatima's culture/religion does not allow alcohol at dinner.\" but letting them decide for themselves if they were to drink or not. \n\nFatima could then choose her best course of action; leaving the table with alcohol,  continuing dinner but deciding never to go out with those who drank again in the future. \n\nIt seems a little shitty your friends stuck you with the bill, but I'd guess you were stubborn & rude just like when you insisted on no beer & things got heated.", "YTA, there was a solution to respect your friend's religion - Fatima would not partake in drinking alchohol.\n\nI think it's common etiquette to pay for the table if you order for the table.  Glad your friends read your gesture appropriately.", "YTA...The group doesn't have to adhere to one person's faith.  It's up to Fatima to navigate these situations.  She can order her own water and let other people live their own lives according to their faith or philosophy.", "INFO---Confusing; Your post header implies the group thought you were buying thus you could control what comes to the table. At the end you state they 'left me w/ the bill'?", "YTA. \n\nHer religion does not get to dictate what other people do.", "YTA. Fatima\u2019s religious choices are just that.. HERS. If she doesn\u2019t want to be around alcohol she doesn\u2019t have to be. Instead you made a blanket choice for all the people involved, and stripped them of THEIR choice. Fatima needs to learn to speak up about her needs and/or excuse themself.", "YTA initially.  My mother is 33 years sober, and I don't drink when we go out to dinner, but that's my choice.  I would never tell anyone else out to dinner with not to do it.  If she feels that strongly about her beliefs she can choose not to go out to dinner at restaurants that sell alcohol or you can go out to dinner with her alone so you don't have to worry about others drinking.\n\nThey shouldn't have left you with the bill, but at least the waters you ordered were free, right?", "YTA\nFirst, smoking isn't haram, but smoking in b the workplace is v being an asshole and z usually against the law. Second, Fatima needs to stop trying to control what others do and so do you. If she doesn't want to be with people who drink beer, she needs to stay with people who don't drink instead of trying to control what others do. But I notice that she didn't say shit, but you got involved. Maybe move to Iran, I heard they're hiring people who like to force their personal version of Islam onto others.", "yta\n\nsomeone else his/her relegion should not impact the rest. if i am a vegatarian, and the rest not, they can still eat meat. so mind your own business. smoking in the break room might be forbidden depending on  the country based on health rules, but relegion can move out off that one too. very entitled to try to force others to keep to religious rules.", "The smoking thing, I understand. It can affect the people around you.   \nBut drinking on the other hand...I don't really get it. It's not like anyone is forcing Fatima or you to drink or forcing you to pay for their drinks.   \nIf you wanna keep Fatima company by not drinking, that's great, you're a really good friend -- but don't stop others from doing it.", "YTA - what if someone wanted bacon on their burger? Did you expect any accompanying women in your group to wear a hijab? See how stupid this is? Preventing other people from doing things that you yourself do not \"believe\" in or partake in is NOT respecting or properly practicing a religion. Also, if she could stick up for herself with the smoking co-worker, she could have spoken up about this. She doesn't need you to be her knight and shining armor bro, you ain't banging her.", "YTA. This is outrageous.", "Dear Fatima,\n\nAs much as I enjoy your company, you must learn to accept that there will be situations where people you are dining or hanging out with are drinking alcohol. If we are out together and others in the group order alcohol I will not stop them. If you insist on others not drinking in your presence, then you will need to offer to pay for all the food and nonalcoholic beverages for the event. Until then, you and I are jointly YTA", "YTA Other's religions don't dictate societal standards. If Fatima doesn't want to be around alcohol, then they should make sure they aren't. It'd be different if it was a gathering for Fatima, but that doesn't seem to be the case.", "YTA", "As a practicing Muslim, you're the AH. If fatima doesn't feel comfortable being in environments where alcohol may be consumed, then she shouldn't be there. She can't expect people to change their behaviour to accommodate her. What if someone wanted pork? Would you have flagged down the waiter and said actually they want chicken? \n\nNext time either tell fatima that there may be drinks so she can decide ahead of time not to come or arrange a 'virgin' night with all of your friends so everyone is on the same page. That way people can opt out.", "YTA.. if you were going out and wanted it to be an alcohol free outing you should have told them that beforehand", "YTA. You don't have to buy the drinks, but you should not have stopped them for ordering. Her religious rules have no effect on them, and it is unreasonable for her to expect others to conform to them.", "YTA. The great thing about religious freedom is that you have the right to practice whichever religion you believe. The flip side of that is that nobody else has to abide by your beliefs.\n\nAnd while I don't drink anymore because it just destroys my ability to keep through the night. I would enjoy having a couple of beers or glasses of wine when going out to eat. And it is a perfectly normal practice. \n\nBut telling them they were not allowed, like you are their parent is a bit much. Especially not disclosing it ahead of time.\n\nI mean did you try telling other people not to drink at all? Or tell adjacent tables not to order any pork?  And then with just your friend if she cannot even be at the same table with somebody drinking, I really hope their were no men in your friend group, because that would be even worse than someone else drinking.\n\nThis is why people don't like a lot of overly religious people or vegans. Because they have this need to dictate what other people can or cannot do around them because of choices they made.", "YTA - i hope next time you friend will bring vegeterian friend to a steak house and order you some tofu.  You don't get to decide what people order. That's pompous and self righteous.", "YTA", "Fake.

Fatima didn\u2019t have to drink, but she doesn\u2019t get to dictate what others do and neither do you. On the smoking thing, if it\u2019s allowed in the break room, then it\u2019s allowed in the break room. Her rules apply to her, not to everyone around her. You were a huge AH to overrule your friend.", "YTA. As a Muslim who also doesn\u2019t drink and who has friends who do, I can\u2019t & would never impose my religious/personal beliefs on my friends. If it really bothers her that much, then she shouldn\u2019t go to these outings. You weren\u2019t doing the noble thing and \u2018sticking up for a friend\u2019 by doing this\u2014you were showing her that the world will bend to her whims and that she has the right to make personal choices for others, which she doesn\u2019t.", "I agree with everyone else here that you cannot possibly expect every single person this girl ever comes in contact with to not do something just because she's Muslim. \n\nBut also, why didn't your friends buy their own drinks? Did you offer to pay for everyone and then back track because this girl was with you? Im confused.", "YTA along with Fatima, she\u2019s Muslim I get it, that doesn\u2019t mean that both of you should have unreasonable expectations on your friends. Telling off your coworker for smoking inside the building and exposing everyone to secondhand smoking is understandable. But intercepting and sabotaging your friends' orders by telling the waiter to order all of you water instead of letting your friends decide what they want for themselves? That was rude, they\u2019re allowed to decide as well just like everyone else. Never force your beliefs onto others, nobody is an extension of each other and you and Fatima should know that by now. \n\nYou and Fatima can do whatever you want with your bodies as long if it's not dangerous, but you two need to learn to be more considerate of others, otherwise your friends probably won\u2019t want to hangout with you anymore. Sometimes in life it\u2019s reasonable interfere in someone\u2019s choices such as telling others that it\u2019s not a good idea to smoke in buildings, sometimes it\u2019s just you bossing others around just to get your way such as interjecting with their food and drink orders. What\u2019s good for you is not necessarily good for them", "INFO. Would you be the one paying even if they got beer? They cannot expect you to buy them what they want, but if they paid for their own drinks, then you have no right to control them.\n\nAlso, Fatima sounds like an awful person. Her religion dictates what SHE should and shouldn't do, not the people around her. Also also, did you see Fatima grimace from just her eyes, or is she attacking other people using her religion, but meanwhile not wearing a burka in public?", "He's obviously the AH but lets be real most people would know that what he did in the moment wasn't right. OP just tell her you like her instead of white knighting", "Yta", "Yeah YTA. Adults can drink whatever the hell they want, and her excuse for religion is ridiculous when you\u2019re at a bar. You\u2019re not \u2018setting boundaries\u2019 here, you and your friend are just being dicks.", "YTA: That is Fatimas religion not your friends. No one else needs to accommodate a religion that's not theirs in a social setting. The fact that you forced that on them justifies them being upset with you.", "Yta,\nDoes this mean no pork in front of her.  Must other women cover their heads?  She obviously shouldn't be pressured to participate but she doesn't get veto power.", "YTA.\nI have muslin friends and they are fine with me drinking, religion is a personal choice, you can\u2019t force their rules to somebody else.", "YTA no you don\u2019t get to decide whether your friends drink at an outting. You were rude and overstepped majorly. This is something you should have brought up before everyone met and asked if they mind refraining from drinking. Some would not mind, others would chose not to come. The way you did it ruined the dinner for everyone.", "Muslims pray 5 times a day.  Will you be rounding up your friends and forcing that as well?\n\nYTA.", "So this is basically about Fatima noticeably grimacing and you white knighting because she wants to seem like a victim and you want to be the hero.

While your intentions seem to be good, it's a bad idea to make assumptions about people.  Best to ask ahead of time, but if you hadn't anticipated the issue, you could have asked at dinner when the friends started discussing beer.  Generally though, when people have strict observances, it is their responsibility to keep themselves out of situations that don't align with their observances.  If Fatima isn't ok with being around people drinking, she should have brought that up before accepting an invitation to dinner with you and others, since drinking at dinner is a common thing.  Maybe this is an opportunity to learn how to effectively navigate social situations for her also.  \n\nIf Fatima is not ok with being in a group where people are drinking and you still want to have a dinner, give the other friends a heads up, preferably before the dinner so that they know.

One of my friends is Muslim, and is very strict about everything, for example once one of her coworkers was smoking in the break room and she asked her to do it somewhere else, as it\u2019s against her religion. My friends wanted drinks, and I saw that my Muslim friend (I\u2019ll call her Fatima) looked to the ground and grimaced. When the waiter came I told him for just a few glasses of water, nothing else, and my friend interjected and asked for a beer, I stoped the waiter and told him no, just water. When he came back with the water, all my other friends piped up at me and started an argument about it. Fatima was being silent, but later told me she appreciated what I did. After dinner, my friends left me with the bill and drove home. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If his intent is to date Fatima which means become Muslim he's going to lose the friends when he stops drinking anyway.", "The slang meaning for out of pocket or outta pocket is that someone was behaving in a wild, ridiculous or extreme way.", "She didn\u2019t tell\n\n> she asked her to do it somewhere else\n\nCoworkers shouldn\u2019t have to avoid the break room, because it\u2019s a health hazard. \n\nIt\u2019s also just common courtesy to smoke outside.", "I\u2019d say you always have a right to ask. But if it\u2019s permitted to smoke indoors there then I guess they don\u2019t have to accommodate her.", "How much of a shitty coworker do you have to be to force your colleagues to breathe your secondhand smoke in a breakroom for ALL employees. It's not about religion, it's about basic decency.", "If is allowed and they are following the rules and is their right to be in the break room as much as you do. You can politely ask them not to light up while you are there. Or you can be the adult and leave when they exercise their right to use their break room at work in the way they are allowed too \n\nI hate the smell I don\u2019t want smokers indoors. I hate going to bars where I live because is allowed.  But your rights are not more valid than theirs \n\nSure politely ask but don\u2019t tell them not to.  \nSo yea she is an ah too.", "Legally, the smoker is fine. Ethically, they are TA. There\u2019s more than religion at play here. Secondhand smoke is not good for you and will affect people around you.", "\ud83d\ude1c", "I hate it too but if it\u2019s allowed in a room then it\u2019s not for me to tell people they can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have to sit in that room with them.", "That's what I was thinking! Surprised no asked INFO: Are you romantically interested in Fatima?\n\nIf he is this is still dumb but now I can see that it was moreso white knight behavior.", "I\u2019ve always heard it in contexts where it meant unavailable. If someone wanted to speak to the boss but she wasn\u2019t in, I might say, \u201cShe\u2019s out of pocket at the moment. Can I take a message?\u201d\n\nI like this meaning too, though!", "Nah, there are times where it is unreasonable. Sure you have a right, but that doesn't make it ok.\n\nFor example, don't go to a bar with a bunch of people who drink and expect them not to drink. Don't enter an establishment that allows smoking if you don't want to be around second hand smoke.", "Legally, you always have the right to ask. I have the right to ask you to wear a penguin on your head. You are under no legal obligation to do so.*\n\n\n\n*Unless you live in that one village north of the Arctic Circle, then you might be legally obligated to wear the penguin.", "I think the Muslim woman can ask someone to not smoke in a break room that does allow smoking, but the person smoking can refuse. It is the choice of the person smoking to decide what they want to do. The difference is the OP imposed his will on his friend by deciding what she can or cannot have. I am surprise he did not order all the leaks to make sure they did not offend the Muslim woman. OP should have pulled his friend who ordered the drink aside and ask her if she would not drink and the friend can then make the decision, not the OP. So YTA is correct.", "But Fatima didn\u2019t object to the smoking on health concern grounds, but because of her religion. This is imposing her beliefs on others", "They aren't using secondhand smoke as a reason. They're using religion.", "Okay this post is literally not about the coworker. Fatima is an AH for forcing others to comply to her religion and/or preferences and her friend (OP) is an asshole for enabling and supporting it. \n\nYour smoking boundary doesn't trump a policy that's allowed. You have a problem? Take it up with HR. And no. A smoking boundary bc of YOUR religion is t going to\nFly.", "For sure, didn't suggest otherwise", "Some are born there, e.g. Children of immigrants to western nations from Muslim majority countries. Some like the benefits of living in a western democracy even if they don't have a sharia legal system.\n\nFWIW, I think people should be able to practice their religion in whatever way want to up until it affects the lives of others. \n\nHarmful religious/cultural practices like child circumcision, forced marriages, routine covering up sexual or other abuse, telling women they can't access medical care such as abortion, \"conversion therapy\" for gay people etc should not be tolerated in progressive democracies though. Basically do your religion, but don't use it as an excuse to hurt people.", "It's actually 15ft, at least in the state of Illinois anyway.", "Of course! But at least it would be a reason", "The bosses and the company shouldn't allow smoking in a shared breakroom. That's seriously gross. I don't want to breathe anyone's secondhand smoke. If I was a smoker I wouldn't do that to my colleagues either.", "Has Fatima spent ANY time in the Middle East? Most of the men smoke like chimneys", "Honestly, I don\u2019t care because this is a place where health concerns match religion. Not smoking would have a positive outcome for all involved. \n\nAnd maybe she claimed it was against her religion because she thought it would be taken more seriously.", "Her religion forbids them from consuming tobacco.  Many people interpret that to include 2nd hand smoke.", "And? Just because her stated reason is religion doesn\u2019t erase the positive outcomes from not smoking that everyone would benefit from.", ">Her religion means she cannot \"smoke\".  Second hand smoke can be as bad as first hand smoke because it is being drawn into your lungs by the simple act of breathing.  So 2nd hand smoke is the \"Religious reason\"", "Worked at a place where coworkers had to take their breaks outside to smoke, I would sometimes join them(if the weather was warm enough) for the social \"break\" but yeah, indoors smoking is simply unfair to others as they don't have a choice about breathing the smoke.", "You do know there are muslin in countries other than those in the Middle East, yea?", "Dude. No one is arguing that. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean you can stop someone where it's allowed. That's it."]}
