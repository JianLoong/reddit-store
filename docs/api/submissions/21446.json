She'd be even smarter if she met someone she was more aligned with.", "> she refuses to do any kind of joint account even though we live together and just venmo each the money we need for rent and other stuff\n\nEntirely reasonable and responsible for this state/stage of the relationship. This is the correct way.\n\n> She recently told me she doesn\u2019t want to go any further with our relationship until I paid off my student loans, credit card and car.\n\nAgain.

You can set that boundary. She can respect it, dump you, and evict you.\n\nIt's gotta be YTA TBH... Mostly for the self harm. Partially for blowing off the concerns of your GF.\n\nListen you're allowed to have fun. Your GF is allowed to set limits on what will be tolerated. Discovering if those limits are compatible with your living style is part of discovering whether you're compatible with eachother.", "YTA. Dude, you do realize that if she marries you, your debt is her debt? She is right, the two of you are not compatible in terms of finances and it's better to break it off now rather than drag it on.", "YTA 100%. Your gf does not want to be married to someone irresponsible. Of course, she doesn't want a joint account, she'd be worried every day about you spending it.  It doesn't sound like she's asking for perfection; she just wants an adult relationship. Either grow up or give up on the relationship; if you don't do either one, she'll do it for you and rightly so.", "YTA, you don't need a \"second hand bmw\" even if you do like it. You can get it back when you can afford it. If I was her I would leave too. Luckily my partner and I both have the same financial goals which is key in a relationship. You're acting like a spoiled baby. Grow up.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m surprised she is even with you so at least she is sensible to keep your name off her account and money. You sound like a child, and I am 100% in agreement with her decisions and rational. Much like a child doesn\u2019t like it when a parent explains the value of money and why they can\u2019t have something; your responses are very similar.", "YTA.  You\u2019re living beyond your means and I suspect you don\u2019t  realize how much your gf is actually subsidizing your lifestyle.  \n\nDoes she pay for home maintenance/ repairs/ upgrades on the home you live in while you pay below average rent?  Houses are incredibly expensive to upkeep.  \n\nDo you benefit from her free labour while she cooks your food and cleans your home?  Home cooked food saves a lot of money, because that cost is made up for by the work of shopping/cooking/cleaning up meals.  \n\nYour gf prioritizes stability and planning a future together, by your own account you spend your money on an extravagant car, and toys like video games.  You are carrying consumer debt on a credit card, which by it\u2019s very nature is high interest, so you can\u2019t afford those splurges.  You aren\u2019t even arguing for spending extra on experiences like travel or making memories, just expensive toys, and you value those above the future of your relationship. \n\nYou will likely never see eye to eye on financial matters with your gf, so this relationship is probably not going to last.", "If you were willing to forgo a bit more fun than you are currently having while still having more fun than she is suggesting, then you could pay it off in 3 years, right?\n\nI've seen this before and quite frankly, by the time I had read paragraph two, I knew that this relationship is doomed. She is very strict and responsible financially and you're too laissex-fiare with your money. She'll eventually realize that your level of financial strategy will not work with her lifestyle. You already know that you don't want to live up to the same standards and even meeting halfway will be a huge compromise on both of your parts while making it difficult and stressful for each of you. I don't think you'll be happy together in the long term.", "So I wonder why she refuses to do joint finances with you? Wait, I know - it's all in this post. You're an economic disaster, and she refuses to be dragged down with you. Good for her.\n\nShe wants to invest in her future. She doesn't want to tie herself to a boat anchor. Right now, you're the financial boat anchor, and you're refusing to do anything about it. \n\nCredit card debt is expensive! You are completely crazy to voluntarily keep credit card debt. Do you understand what compound interest looks like?\n\nAre you an asshole? Not really, but you are clearly fiscally irresponsible, and not at all marriage material.\n\nNAH", ">she refuses to do any kind of joint account \n\n>I\u2019m not good with finances I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m in credit card debt and have a guilty pleasure of a second hand bmw\n\nYeah, no wonder she doesn't want a joint account. \n\n\nSounds to me as if you two are simply not compatible when it comes to finances. NAH but this might very well the breaking point of your relationship.", "I mean, for a judgment NAH.\n\nBut your GF is right.  She has her finances together and you\u2019re financially irresponsible.  Marrying you is a financial liability.  She\u2019s smart to have laid it all out for you.  Money is one of the most common reasons for divorce.  She sees your flaws and isn\u2019t willing to committed to you unless she sees a change.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s your life and if you want to be irresponsible then so be it.\n\nBut guaranteed she\u2019ll break up with you.", "YTA.  Living on the edge? That's another way of saying my girlfriend will bail me out. Now you're all pickachu faced because she's told you she won't.  \n\nWhat if you crash your beloved BMW?

She's telling you she wants a relationship with a grown-up,  not a teenager", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to agree to have the same financial perspective exactly in a long-term relationship, but you two are polar opposites and if she continues the relationship into marriage she will literally be taking on your debt herself since you refuse to deal with it like an adult. \n\nYour future self will likely be quite unhappy with your current hedonism. You sound very immature and short-sighted and she\u2019s way past you in that regard. She\u2019s smart to lay down some criteria for you to demonstrate that she (and your shared future) matters more to you than minor, pleasant (but unnecessary) purchases.", "**And she does have her shit together, her student loans are paid off, she bought a house I just moved into and she has savings but she\u2019s expecting everyone to live like her and I\u2019m ok not having as much savings. I\u2019m actually ok living on the edge a bit but I know it bothers her a lot.**\n\nThis is why she doesn't have a joint account with you.

She\u2019s smart to say no because all you\u2019re going to do is bleed her dry. It doesn\u2019t sound like you two are financially compatible.", "YTA, you're describing this issue as if its a difference in tastes or personality, like you want to try all sorts of different foods but your girlfriend only wants to eat plain food. It's not. It's about different maturity and intelligence levels. Your girlfriend has her shit together and wants a partner who has his shit together too. The way you describe this, you're digging yourself into a further debt hole that she will have to dig you out of. She's telling you she's not.", "YTA \n\nYou live in her house , ok \u201c slightly lower rent\u201d, she cooks.. seems like she already subsidized your life style. And you want more mom from her?\nYikes", "YTA.  Did you move in because you wanted cheaper rent and someone to pay for and make your meals? Or did you move in because you love her?  If you love her then compromise by both of you is required. If this is her hill to die on, then you have a decision to make. If you are only taking advantage, then the free (or reduced rate) ride is ending.  Based on your narrative, your GF has a point, and that point is she doesn\u2019t want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t plan for or care about their financial future.", "YTA. You should be driving a cheaper car if you\u2019re in debt. Luxuries are for people who have the money to spend on them, not for people who are spending money they don\u2019t have. I\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t small things you can indulge in from time to time, but there are things you can live without. \n\nYour girlfriend is almost 30. If she wants kids, she may have a timeline on that. Every day she spends with someone who shows that he\u2019s going to prioritize his needs over your joint needs as a couple is a day she\u2019s going to realize she can do better to find someone to spend her life and potentially start a family with and you\u2019re wasting her time. \n\nHer ultimatum is totally fair. Honestly, i wouldn\u2019t have let you move in with me until you came up with a plan to pay off this debt and spent 6 months doing it.", "ESH but also INFO \n\nHer wanting you to be in a better financial position before committing any further to your relationship is perfectly understandable. She doesn\u2019t want to marry your debt and wants to know she\u2019s marrying someone who takes their financial position seriously. It\u2019s a big issue if you ever have a family together etc. so her points are valid.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t see why it has to be so all or nothing. This is where I want more info - with your current $500 a month, will you actually clear your debt? Or is it still growing because you\u2019re still using your credit card for your games etc.? How much debt are you actually in?\n\nThe amount of debt you have, total, and your reluctance to take a serious step to pay it off, really changes things here.\n\nThe fact that $500 a month isn\u2019t enough to quickly clear it makes me concerned you\u2019re quite deep in. And in this case, you\u2019re not an AH, you\u2019re just being dumb. Think about your future dude.", "INFO: what are you gonna do if she decides to go on vacations yearly and you can\u2019t go? Are you gonna expect her to pay or sulk that you can\u2019t go?\nBecause the way you\u2019re living, you won\u2019t be able to do those fun things with her.", "NAH. Your gf prioritizes saving and financial responsibility. You don't. This is a fundamental incompatibility. She'll resent you for feeling like she's the only one saving for the future. You'll resent her because she'll never approve of the way you spend money.", "YTA You want to combine finances despite your GF managing her money and you being in significant debt. Until you grow up and start managing your money better it\u2019s no wonder she doesn\u2019t want to move forward with you. \n\nYou need to sort your life out or she\u2019ll move on", "And a used BMW? Have fun with all the repair bills", "YTA for sure.  Do you not understand that she'll assume your debt if you get married?\n\nGrow up and pay your bills", "Yta she don't help you?. You said because she cook so you spend less to eat that don't count as help . Rent under market rate still not help I wonder what kind of help you provide to her. If you broke up and you have to move out her house you will in big trouble.", "You lost me with the \"IDC hahaha I love my car\".\n\nTbh u don't know... You sound like an AH but at the end of the day you decide how you want to live your life regardless of what anyone can tell you. Also your GF or ex I don't know at this point is 100% in the right mindset, in fact I wish I had a partner like that when I was younger. She sound exhausting sure but if weren't that irresponsible with your finances I don't think she will act the same.\nI'll go with YTA mostly cause she mention the marriage idea so i think that was a thing in the future, but with your attitude and the way you want to live you're 100% not compatible with her mindset.", "NAH. I get where you\u2019re both coming from and if you want to continue in the relationship you need to compromise. Perhaps if you sat down with her, you could make a three year plan that allows more \u201cfun\u201d for you but is still a budget that has an end goal for her.", "Are you looking for advice? Here's some, she doesn't want to be legally tied to *your* debt, which is fair. Either use the extra money she's letting you save (which is incredibly kind of her), and pay off your debt, or move out, live your life on the edge (which is your right), and keep dating till she dumps you and finds someone a little more mature. \n\nNah (but you're really close to y t a)", "NAH. Different people have different priorities for their lives and their finances, but she's not wrong for nothing that this is a big incompatibility.", "You spend money like teenager. Perfection is not the expectation. You\u2019re on the edge of getting broken up with and kicked out. YTA for thinking she\u2019s too uptight when really you\u2019re just irresponsible", "Well really there\u2019s NAH but I don\u2019t understand why your girlfriend is still with you if you\u2019re irresponsible financially. I recommend you read a book or two on compounded interest and how it can greatly help you for your future goals and how an outstanding credit card debt is you borrowing money from your future self.", "YTA. She's right. You should watch Caleb Hammer's YouTube videos, or someone like Dave Ramsey, and get an idea of how to budget and what you need to do to get out of debt. Because you can live however you want, but you can't expect her to marry you and mix finances while you clearly don't care. You're just gonna drag her future down.", "YTA.  I wouldn't even be living with you, or honestly dating you at all because you sound like a financial liability and a leech.  She doesn't want your debt, nobody would.", "YTA, time to grow the fuck up.", "Can you ask her if she\u2019ll help me figure my shit out? I\u2019ll take her help!", "You seem somewhat childish honestly.  She's in a much more mature developed space than you, which is not a bad thing. You just aren't there yet. She's sees you as a financial train wreck waiting to happen if she combines finances, as she should.  How do you think of continuing a relationship possibly marriage, if you can't prove you can provide for her in \"sickness and in health\"?  Physical, mental, emotional, and financial health? \n\nNAH, Just not on the same page at this junction in your lives.  Nothing wrong with how you live your life, but she's in a different space dude.", "My judgement is secondary to the basic fact that you two are on completely opposite ends of the financial spending spectrum and are not just compatible as a result. My mom is more reserved with money and my dad is more open to spending so they balance each other out but you too are too far apart for it to work.\n\nPersonaly I'd be leaning towards NAH or maybe you being a slight 'A' as you are on the border between 'living on the edge' and being financially irresponsible IMO, however, I know I'm like your girlfriend and save every dollar and penny and avoid frivolous expenses like the plague so I may be a bit biased. In the end dude it doesn't matter what anyone here thinks as much as it matters that you two ain't going to work with your hugely different attitudes with money. Happens a lot... just read this sub a bit.", " YTA. She needs to break up with you and marry someone financially responsible for her own sake. \u201cI like living life on the edge.?\u201d You are an idiot, dude, as nicely as I can put it.", "Dude if you really love her just hold that L and get your shit together I made the same mistake with my ex and I haven\u2019t been the same since \nYTA", "Your debt is holding you back from growing up. You need to take responsibility over your debt. I know that\u2019s hard, but when your paid off everything it feels great. I would recommend that you make a budget and stick to it. Yes you\u2019re the", "Yta. Your gf needs to find someone on her wavelength in regards to finances.", "NAH\n\nYou're not an asshole for managing your money (or not) the way you like. \n\nAnd your girlfriend won't be an asshole when she dumps your ass over it. \n\nShe's made her terms clear. If you go along, you'll get along. And if you don't, she's going to start checking out and eventually break up with you, just like she said she would.", "NAH, but mismatched finances kill the romance fast and your girlfriend is thinking about the future.  You value having a good time at the sake of your credit score, and she doesn't want that to drag her down.  She's a smart cookie, and it might actually serve you to listen to her before she dumps you and you have to go back to market-value rent.", "NAH.\n\nYou're expecting to combine assets/intertwine your life with someone who is objectively more responsible than you are and you're shocked she doesn't want to do that until you agree to commit to doing something about digging yourself out of a financial hole? \n\nLook, you can live how you want, but these aren't unreasonable expectations as far as taking the relationship further is concerned. She may not be helping your finances now, but if you get more serious (married etc.), she'll be bound to you in ways she (understandably) doesn't want to be if you intend to keep living as you are. If this is truly you're hill to die on, just shake hands and part friends now.", "Go to r/personalfinance and tell how your spending is. YTA.", "NAH You\u2019re just not compatible", "NAH.\n\nIf all you need is 2 years to pay off your student loans, credit card debt, and car, then you really should just hunker down and do it.  Those are the 3 worst types of loans you could have (in that exact order) and you should absolutely want to pay them off as quickly as possible.  If the combined amount is low enough that it can be paid off that relatively short period of time, then sucking it up and doing it is the best possible thing you could do in the long run.  You can cut down on your discretional spending to pay off your loans very quickly without 100% dropping all of the fun in your life.  For example, wait for the game you want to go on sale and buy it for $20 instead of $60.\n\nIf you refuse to make this kind of a compromise in order to better your financial situation and, by extension, your future with your girlfriend, then she's perfectly within her rights to move on without you.  You're well within your rights to not make any changes to pay these loans off asap but you have to be prepared to deal with the consequences.", "NAH. However I think both of you could compromise a bit. She isn\u2019t wrong that you could put more towards your debt and be out of it quicker but giving up everything you enjoy will kill the relationship just as fast. However, if you are putting more on credit cards while you pay off you won\u2019t ever get out from under it even with $500 payments. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to look at her calculations and then look to see how long, and most specifically, how much interest you will pay on only what your current balance is now and paying only $500 a month. I don\u2019t know what you owe but if it takes 7 years you could easily be paying 100% of your purchases in additional interest. And that\u2019s if you put absolutely nothing more on those cards. I know student debt can be painful but to me, I would put that as more acceptable debt assuming you can continue to pay it. She isn\u2019t wrong to not combine finances with someone with a vastly different outlook on money. See if you two can find some middle ground. Maybe pick two interests that you allow yourself to spend a bit of extra on guilt free, or a certain dollar amount you can spend without question each month while all of the remaining post bills gets out towards your credit cards. She might agree to this if she sees you actually trying. Otherwise, you two are financially incompatible and that\u2019s a marriage/relationship killer almost every time", "NAH you\u2019re incompatible.", "NAH. I agree with both of you, you just have different goals. Understand her, if she wants to marry and have children, she needs responsibility and to make sure she won't get in trouble. Women are often in more vulnerable position because of this. \n\n The red flag for me is how you seem entitled to have this joint account. Looks like you wanna profit of her.", "NTA, but... you two seem to be financially incompatible. That tends to be an insurmountable hurdle for long term relationships. I'm sorry but I don't see a secure future for you two unless something changes drastically.", "Clearly NAH.\n\nYour girlfriend is right when it comes to managing money. Paying down debt is smart and spending when you have cash is better. Based on what you posted, her habits are healthier than yours.\n\nHowever, being constantly nagged and even threatened with breakup over a very specific period to pay off the debt isn't the way an adult handles the relationship.\n\nIf your girlfriend is serious about both money and the relationship, she'll compromise on having a plan that's reasonable for both.", "NTA, but definitely making unwise financial choices that will affect your future and your gf's future. It's fine you both don't agree, it just means you won't be together forever. Why would she tie her finances to yours if you're just a financial burden? She's thinking about her future, home/kids/retirement. Finances are a huge part of making all those things a reality. She's not wrong in her logic even an ounce. If that doesn't jive with you, you can leave. Tbh, I would think about it long and hard because it seems if you don't come around soon, she will leave you. Sacrificing these extra expenditures for a year or two is well worth a stable life and relationship, assuming no abuse is taking place and you can see yourself marrying this woman. Get on the same wavelength, or get out. You're currently destroying your future, while she is building hers.", "Fuck no, youre broke, you are 100% doing the right thing.", "I don\u2019t think I would enjoy her company. She too fixated on financial crap. Wonder if that comes from having nothing growing up or someone told her that month is her self worth. Life is short and if that car gives you joy beep beep. You do need to work on paying off shit, it\u2019s only make your life better without hanging over your head. You both need to come to the middle if this will ever work out long term.", "ESH\n\nYour girlfriend is correct; if y'all were to join finances in the future, you would absolutely bring her down financially. You can't expect her to ever assume your burdens like this. And she can't expect you to change your habits for her. This relationship  probably won't last much longer anyway.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
