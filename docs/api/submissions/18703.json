We both have full-time jobs, a mortgage, and 2 dogs. I cover around 80-90% of the household expenses, including the mortgage, power, insurance, internet, and water bill. She only pays for gas and groceries, and I usually cover the bill when we eat out. We've had this arrangement for several years. We have this arrangement because my income is a lot higher then hers and she has a car payment and student loans she\u2019s paying off.\n\nRecently, with the baby on the way, I've expressed the need for more careful spending. We've been discussing bigger expenses. However, today she suggested going to Mexico to visit her godkids. She got upset when I expressed my inability to afford an unplanned trip, especially considering the expenses we've already had this year. We took a trip to Denver in April, went to South Carolina last month for my uncle's birthday party, and I'm soon heading back to South Carolina to discuss his will since he has cancer and wants my assistance with carrying out his will.\n\nThe tickets for the Mexico trip alone are currently around $600 each, and the total cost of the trip would likely be at least $2,000, considering other expenses there. When she asked if I wanted to go, I honestly told her that I can't afford it due to the unexpected expenses we've already had this year. \n\nI have more credit card debt than savings at the moment and need to focus on reducing it. Additionally, as first-time parents, we should be financially prepared for any unexpected expenses that may arise.\n\nI also reminded her that I lent her $2,000 recently to pay her income tax bill, which she promised to repay as soon as she could save up the money.\n\nShe accused me of being selfish and claimed this might be our last chance to travel before the baby arrives. I suggested a more budget-friendly alternative, like a local trip to San Antonio using my accumulated points for a two-night stay. However, she instantly rejected the idea and insisted on seeing her godkids. I then told her that if she really wants to go, she can do so, as I believe it's more important for us to be financially stable before the baby arrives in five months. We haven't made any major purchases yet, despite her sisters planning a baby shower.\n\nAs I'm typing this, she is ignoring me and not speaking to me. (AITA)?\n\nUpdate: last night I sent her a screenshot showing my credit card debit and my savings account to her.  I told her I\u2019m basically paycheck to paycheck now because life has been a bit more expensive these past few months then expected. I\u2019ve cut back on steaming services, eating out, etc. we use to eat out once a weekend for \u201cdate night\u201d\n\nShe said I\u2019m overreacting and she would sell some concert tickets she had bought to get money back.  She said money comes and goes, and I should live in the moment. I told her I\u2019m more worried about making sure we have a home and her suggestion was well we can sell and downsize.\n\nUpdate 2: if anyone who\u2019s had kids has some numbers on what stuff cost, feel free to send them to me or drop them in the post.  I\u2019m planning to have a sit down and infuse logic with facts.  She clearly thinks I\u2019m crazy on it not working. Also thanks to those for pointing out Zika, I hadn\u2019t even considered that tbh.\n\nUpdate 3:  we\u2019re using her health insurance for delivery. As of right now they told her for delivery she might hit the deductible through her appointments.  For her dr appointment is $280 each time.  We have been splitting the costs. She has maternity leave for 8 weeks through her job, and then I get 4 months parental leave.", "created_utc": 1685622690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xgcsl/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_on_a_trip_with_my/", "score": 1567, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure she's a nice person, but she's manipulating you by calling you the selfish one when she's being selfish. Considering the amount of bills you pay, that you lent her money to pay her taxes, and have already taken several trips, I'd say your idea on saving and getting your credit card debt down should take precedence over anything else, especially with inflation rates skyrocketing. It seems to me that your fianc\u00e9 definitely needs a reminder of your finances, and she needs to be more responsible with her obvious spending issues before you both end up in trouble down the road. She's obviously not in a hurry to pay back what she already owes you.  You definitely seem to be the more responsible one with the finances.", "NTA but since you cover the huge majority of the bills does she know how much goes out how much is saved how much you have for \u201cfun\u201d money?

Unfortunate that you have a kid on the way because otherwise I would be suggesting you head for the hills.

Economy is changing inflation is insane she\u2019s going to have to cut back on luxuries and actually contribute to the life she wants.

Does she have any idea how much it's going to cost to give birth? What about if there are complications? What if something unfortunate happens to you and you can't work? Babies, children, and teens are expensive as hell, and y'all need to save your money for the unexpected.

You have different priorities. You mentioned she hasn't had a chance to visit her family in 5-6 years. It may be another 5-6 years after the kid gets here before she gets another chance. It's going to get more difficult and more expensive; especially for international travel. In 3 years you'll need to get the baby a passport, may need pay for an extra plane ticket; pay to ship or pack a lot of extra gear such as a car seat, stroller or playpen, etc. You're going to be a lot more limited on where you can go, how long you can be there, and what you can do.\n\nMy partner and I just had a baby in March. Last October, my job sent me to Europe for 3 weeks. I broke into my savings and spent $3k to fly him out to me in Italy and another $1k on us traveling in Europe for a week after my work assignment. I had significant medical bills during the pregnancy and I knew there was a high risk he'd end up in NICU when he got here and no clue how much that was going to be. But I also knew that we weren't going to get a chance to travel like that for years. And I'm really glad we did. Now that our son's here we're paying down the hospital bills and I'm building my savings back up but I don't regret the trip at all and that wasn't even to see family. Definitely be sure you've got a stable housing situation and everything but babies don't really need that much in the way of stuff and our baby shower provided way more than we needed for most daily stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso if people are curious, kiddo's not even 3 months old. I've put $3k of that back in savings, and I'm working on the last $1k. That's not including that he has a savings account and a 529 that I've put money into as well. The NICU bill will take about a year to pay off but it is what it is and could have been way worse. I prioritized us traveling before he was born and we cut back out traveling as well as eating out and other hobbies later in the pregnancy and after he got here. It's all about priorities and reviewing your budget for where you can change it.", "NTA. It's easy to say money comes and goes when it is someone else's money. Children are wildly expensive and she doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on the reality of your financial situation, even after seeing your statements. Does she work? Is she going to be a SAHM?

Or can you discuss all of it over zoom? Is in person necessary for some reason?", "Yeah if you have money to visit your family but not hers there MAY be an asshole component here.\n\nObviously a wedding and someone having cancer are exceptional situations which is why I said MAYBE\u2026 but you may want to see if the pattern continues or if it is just an exceptional year", "No, they are getting married and are one household. Likely she will have more baby related duties and he will have more breadwinning ones.", "He's going to help get his uncle's will and finances together since he has cancer. Its not a vacation. Jeez.", "NTA, but dude, you are engaged to a younger version of my mother in law. I guarantee this isn't going to end well for you.  My mother in law would have said the exact same thing as your fiance which is that you are over reacting and that money comes and goes and things will be okay.

I also used their lactation services multiple times (had a hard time doing it) and the baby went straight into the NICU at the hospital before being transferred to a higher level NICU in a different hospital which was an ambulance ride in a incubator. \n\nThen, I had NICU.  The \u201cbilled amount\u201d for 42 days of NICU was about $500K but we paid about another $5K before hitting our deductible.  NICU over the Christmas holiday and then into the following year, with 6 follow up procedures that resulted in stays of: 10 days, 7 days, 3 days, 3 days, 3 days and 2 days.

We also bought validation for parking at 2 of the hospitals.  \n\nUnfortunately, this is a surprise situation in that the baby will show up whenever the baby shows up.

At best, you will have some warning\u2014but you may not\u2014and then depending on how the delivery goes, you may be in the hospital for 2 days or more.  If she has a tear or injury, she will need stitches or repairs and be in there longer.

Those are both \u201cOP\u201d focused. \n\nWas the Denver trip *her/them* focused? Or at least half way? Or was it another OP trip? \n\nBecause if OP gets 3 trips a year and she doesn\u2019t get any, that\u2019s somewhat unfair\u2026though that\u2019s something to fix *next year* so they can save and pay off debt, not right now, but I can see why one person getting 3 trips and the other getting 0 could cause this friction.", "I don't remember anymore; it was four years ago.

Trips for him and not for her.", "NTA. She is being financially irresponsible. You guys need to communicate better about this. \n\nBut you also need to reevaluate your expenses ASAP. Kids are expensive. Even more so in America than many other places. If you are living paycheck to paycheck now things will get dire if you guys don\u2019t do something.\n\nStart researching baby items. Start with needs first. You need a new car seat and mattress for safety reasons, but many things can be used second hand if in good condition - clothes, toys, cribs etc. feeding will cost money whether breastfeeding or formula. She will need pumping supplies if breastfeeding after returning to work. Look at the cost of formula. A newborn can easily use 12 nappies a day in the first few weeks, how much will that cost you?\n\nThe biggest thing is the cost of childcare, which it sounds like you guys have covered for 6 months. But what about after. Full time childcare is expensive and you may have already left it too late to ensure you get a spot in time. \n\nI suggest you join a local parents Facebook group for baby budget numbers as so many things vary based on where you live.", "NTA. \n\nI ended up having to have a c-section - so my delivery went from normal L&D to a major surgery, additional surgical staff, and anesthesiologist + meds. \n\nMy baby had jaundice - so we had to to stay an extra 2 days until her levels got in a healthier range. \n\nThe total bill after insurance? $10K. \n\n**This was almost 18 years ago**.  I can\u2019t even imagine what that cost is like now.", "NTA. So I have currently been shopping for baby stuff as I am pregnant. I am fortunate enough to have hand me down clothes and swaddles from friends and family so I don\u2019t have to spend money there. However, we still need a lot of other stuff and the big stuff. I have been frugal and bought a lot of stuff second hand off of Facebook marketplace.  Some of what I\u2019ve spent money on so far: $100 Glider/rocker (retails for $250+), pack n play $85 (retails for $150), crib & mattress $150 (retail varies widely but average probably $350), infant car seat + extra base $350. \nYou\u2019ve got to consider things like bottles, baby monitor, high chair, furniture for the nursery, stroller, diapers, formula. It\u2019s expensive. I\u2019d ask her if she has registry started and look to see if she\u2019s picked out a bunch of expensive stuff. You should be involved in that process.", "This would be a fine point if she wasn't funding her \"memories\" on his dime.\n\nHe pays almost all their bills.\n\nAny money she spends on \"memories\" is basically coming from his pocket.", "Yeah, you know what. You\u2019re all right. \n\nOP, you\u2019ve made a mistake. You\u2019ve picked the wrong women. You\u2019ve wasted several years of your life with her. You need to dump her. Your soon-to-be-born child is doomed before they\u2019ve breathed their first breath. Run! Nothing is worth working on!\n\nThis sub is hilarious for its inability (or unwilling) to understand unwritten context. They\u2019ve been together for years, they\u2019ve decided to have a child together, OP has expressed no issue with the financial arrangement before now nor has he suggested that there is anything else wrong. There is no suggestion that he is a vulnerable person being taken advantage of and we also only have his side of the story so there will undoubtedly be a heavy bias in his favour. That\u2019s natural. It may not be the way you\u2019d choose to be in a relationship, but it doesn\u2019t make it wrong if this is what two consenting adults have chosen to do and it doesn\u2019t necessarily make either of them arseholes. \n\nDo people here really just love to be judgmental and call people arseholes or is this doomsday advice what they\u2019d give to their friends?", ">This isn't a good mindset, obviously.\n\nNow at least. \n\nSeems like a mindset that would have worked really well for most of our evolutionary history, pre stuff like money and debt.", "Those were at-least planned out this is spontaneous", ">so there will undoubtedly be a heavy bias in his favour.\n\nThis sub openly hates men. Any bias in his favor is overwritten by the blatant sexism here. If people are siding with a man versus a woman, that's significant here.\n\nNot to mention, most of the top comments are pretty moderate and reasonable, so I'm not really sure what your strawman is for.\n\nAs for \"doomsday\" advice, he is literally in debt supporting his pregnant gf who barely contributes to the household, and all she can think about is \"vacation time\".\n\nYou are the one who's biased. I mean you are literally claimed to be similar to the fiancee.\n\nOf course all these insults towards her make you feel bad. And suggestions to dump her make you feel insecure about your own relationship. Tough shit, but don't put that on OP.", "I agree.  But resentment about  it would explain her devil may care self involvement right now.  \n\nIF the budget is *this* tight, Op *also* doesn\u2019t need to go take a trip to talk  to uncle about the will. \n\nFaceTime, emails, and phones calls would help save money, and though it would take slightly more work, the end product should be the same. \n\nIMO, neither the Mexico trip, or the \u201ctalk to uncle about his will trip\u201d should happen.

Anything involving a flight or different country counts as a big holiday and gets planned (and saved for) at least a few months in advance, and this is Europe where there's a lot in fairly close proximity. If its going to risk any bills going unpaid, or requires a loan, then that is a holiday that won't be happening (or postponed until I can save for it).  But that's just me maybe??", "I just have a question, why the hell is it so uncommon for couples to combine money? Married myself and we\u2019ve had combined money ever since we were engaged.

She needs a reality check.  Your expenses are about to increase by more than 50%."]}
