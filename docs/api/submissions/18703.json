We both have full-time jobs, a mortgage, and 2 dogs. I cover around 80-90% of the household expenses, including the mortgage, power, insurance, internet, and water bill. She only pays for gas and groceries, and I usually cover the bill when we eat out. We've had this arrangement for several years. We have this arrangement because my income is a lot higher then hers and she has a car payment and student loans she\u2019s paying off.\n\nRecently, with the baby on the way, I've expressed the need for more careful spending. We've been discussing bigger expenses. However, today she suggested going to Mexico to visit her godkids. She got upset when I expressed my inability to afford an unplanned trip, especially considering the expenses we've already had this year. We took a trip to Denver in April, went to South Carolina last month for my uncle's birthday party, and I'm soon heading back to South Carolina to discuss his will since he has cancer and wants my assistance with carrying out his will.\n\nThe tickets for the Mexico trip alone are currently around $600 each, and the total cost of the trip would likely be at least $2,000, considering other expenses there. When she asked if I wanted to go, I honestly told her that I can't afford it due to the unexpected expenses we've already had this year. \n\nI have more credit card debt than savings at the moment and need to focus on reducing it. Additionally, as first-time parents, we should be financially prepared for any unexpected expenses that may arise.\n\nI also reminded her that I lent her $2,000 recently to pay her income tax bill, which she promised to repay as soon as she could save up the money.\n\nShe accused me of being selfish and claimed this might be our last chance to travel before the baby arrives. I suggested a more budget-friendly alternative, like a local trip to San Antonio using my accumulated points for a two-night stay. However, she instantly rejected the idea and insisted on seeing her godkids. I then told her that if she really wants to go, she can do so, as I believe it's more important for us to be financially stable before the baby arrives in five months. We haven't made any major purchases yet, despite her sisters planning a baby shower.\n\nAs I'm typing this, she is ignoring me and not speaking to me. (AITA)?\n\nUpdate: last night I sent her a screenshot showing my credit card debit and my savings account to her.  I told her I\u2019m basically paycheck to paycheck now because life has been a bit more expensive these past few months then expected. I\u2019ve cut back on steaming services, eating out, etc. we use to eat out once a weekend for \u201cdate night\u201d\n\nShe said I\u2019m overreacting and she would sell some concert tickets she had bought to get money back.  She said money comes and goes, and I should live in the moment. I told her I\u2019m more worried about making sure we have a home and her suggestion was well we can sell and downsize.\n\nUpdate 2: if anyone who\u2019s had kids has some numbers on what stuff cost, feel free to send them to me or drop them in the post.  I\u2019m planning to have a sit down and infuse logic with facts.  She clearly thinks I\u2019m crazy on it not working.

I'm sure she's a nice person, but she's manipulating you by calling you the selfish one when she's being selfish. Considering the amount of bills you pay, that you lent her money to pay her taxes, and have already taken several trips, I'd say your idea on saving and getting your credit card debt down should take precedence over anything else, especially with inflation rates skyrocketing. It seems to me that your fianc\u00e9 definitely needs a reminder of your finances, and she needs to be more responsible with her obvious spending issues before you both end up in trouble down the road. She's obviously not in a hurry to pay back what she already owes you.  You definitely seem to be the more responsible one with the finances.", "NTA but since you cover the huge majority of the bills does she know how much goes out how much is saved how much you have for \u201cfun\u201d money?

Unfortunate that you have a kid on the way because otherwise I would be suggesting you head for the hills.

They could afford the trip if she paid him back.", "Ohh in that case, this is a non-essential trip, and I agree with you about getting prepared for the baby and avoiding frivolous trips now, especially if it was not budgeted for. I think you should definitely sit with her and set budgets so that you both have an idea of what needs to be done, what trips you can take for the year etc etc. Makes life easier, especially with the baby. \nGood luck, and hopefully, you guys come to a good understanding.", "I would really reconsider marriage with someone who doesn\u2019t understand basic math. \n\nAnd yes this is basic math.

Live in the moment?!!! She\u2019s about to be a mom. She doesn\u2019t get to live in the moment and not worry about finances.

I also don\u2019t care home much more you earn than her it is absolutely ridiculous you\u2019re caring 80-90% of the financial burden. Economy is changing inflation is insane she\u2019s going to have to cut back on luxuries and actually contribute to the life she wants. She\u2019s essentially lived off you this whole relationship and her solution instead of pulling her weight financially is to say it is what it is and it\u2019s just money.

Does she have any idea how much it's going to cost to give birth? What about if there are complications? What if something unfortunate happens to you and you can't work? Babies, children, and teens are expensive as hell, and y'all need to save your money for the unexpected.

You have different priorities. You mentioned she hasn't had a chance to visit her family in 5-6 years. It may be another 5-6 years after the kid gets here before she gets another chance. It's going to get more difficult and more expensive; especially for international travel. In 3 years you'll need to get the baby a passport, may need pay for an extra plane ticket; pay to ship or pack a lot of extra gear such as a car seat, stroller or playpen, etc. You're going to be a lot more limited on where you can go, how long you can be there, and what you can do.\n\nMy partner and I just had a baby in March. Last October, my job sent me to Europe for 3 weeks. I broke into my savings and spent $3k to fly him out to me in Italy and another $1k on us traveling in Europe for a week after my work assignment. I had significant medical bills during the pregnancy and I knew there was a high risk he'd end up in NICU when he got here and no clue how much that was going to be. But I also knew that we weren't going to get a chance to travel like that for years. And I'm really glad we did. Now that our son's here we're paying down the hospital bills and I'm building my savings back up but I don't regret the trip at all and that wasn't even to see family. Definitely be sure you've got a stable housing situation and everything but babies don't really need that much in the way of stuff and our baby shower provided way more than we needed for most daily stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso if people are curious, kiddo's not even 3 months old. I've put $3k of that back in savings, and I'm working on the last $1k. That's not including that he has a savings account and a 529 that I've put money into as well. The NICU bill will take about a year to pay off but it is what it is and could have been way worse. I prioritized us traveling before he was born and we cut back out traveling as well as eating out and other hobbies later in the pregnancy and after he got here. It's all about priorities and reviewing your budget for where you can change it.", "NTA. It's easy to say money comes and goes when it is someone else's money. Children are wildly expensive and she doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on the reality of your financial situation, even after seeing your statements. Does she work? Is she going to be a SAHM? Does she understand that smaller homes bought now can cost more than larger homes bought 5 or 10 years ago? Despite the baby, are you sure marriage is a good idea?", "NTA.

Or can you discuss all of it over zoom? Is in person necessary for some reason?", "Yeah if you have money to visit your family but not hers there MAY be an asshole component here.\n\nObviously a wedding and someone having cancer are exceptional situations which is why I said MAYBE\u2026 but you may want to see if the pattern continues or if it is just an exceptional year", "No, they are getting married and are one household. Likely she will have more baby related duties and he will have more breadwinning ones.", "He's going to help get his uncle's will and finances together since he has cancer. Its not a vacation. Jeez.", "NTA, but dude, you are engaged to a younger version of my mother in law. I guarantee this isn't going to end well for you.  My mother in law would have said the exact same thing as your fiance which is that you are over reacting and that money comes and goes and things will be okay. My father in law is 78, still working, and the house isn't paid off because she spends the money on junk and trips they can't afford. \n\n\nThis also doesn't even bring up how utterly reckless it is for your fianc\u00e9e to be flying to Mexico while pregnant.
