We both have full-time jobs, a mortgage, and 2 dogs. I cover around 80-90% of the household expenses, including the mortgage, power, insurance, internet, and water bill. She only pays for gas and groceries, and I usually cover the bill when we eat out. We've had this arrangement for several years. We have this arrangement because my income is a lot higher then hers and she has a car payment and student loans she\u2019s paying off.\n\nRecently, with the baby on the way, I've expressed the need for more careful spending. We've been discussing bigger expenses. However, today she suggested going to Mexico to visit her godkids. She got upset when I expressed my inability to afford an unplanned trip, especially considering the expenses we've already had this year. We took a trip to Denver in April, went to South Carolina last month for my uncle's birthday party, and I'm soon heading back to South Carolina to discuss his will since he has cancer and wants my assistance with carrying out his will.\n\nThe tickets for the Mexico trip alone are currently around $600 each, and the total cost of the trip would likely be at least $2,000, considering other expenses there. When she asked if I wanted to go, I honestly told her that I can't afford it due to the unexpected expenses we've already had this year. \n\nI have more credit card debt than savings at the moment and need to focus on reducing it. Additionally, as first-time parents, we should be financially prepared for any unexpected expenses that may arise.\n\nI also reminded her that I lent her $2,000 recently to pay her income tax bill, which she promised to repay as soon as she could save up the money.\n\nShe accused me of being selfish and claimed this might be our last chance to travel before the baby arrives. I suggested a more budget-friendly alternative, like a local trip to San Antonio using my accumulated points for a two-night stay. However, she instantly rejected the idea and insisted on seeing her godkids. I then told her that if she really wants to go, she can do so, as I believe it's more important for us to be financially stable before the baby arrives in five months. We haven't made any major purchases yet, despite her sisters planning a baby shower.\n\nAs I'm typing this, she is ignoring me and not speaking to me. Am I the asshole (AITA)?", "created_utc": 1685622690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xgcsl/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_on_a_trip_with_my/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You might want to sit down and go through your entire share budget together with her to make her better aware of what is going on with your shared finances. I think because you are covering almost everything, she has it out of sight, out of mind, and maybe thinks you are worrying for nothing. Show her your current income, your expenses, your debts and how much a newborn is expected to cost - medical bills, new appliances/clothes/furniture, food/nappies. This might sober her up a bit.\n\nP.S. I think in a lot of families the main breadwinner avoids doing that and just \"takes care of it\" which leaves the other party unaware of a lot of things. You can share the information and provide transparency for both of you and no need to act like the stingy uncle that just doesn't want the family to have fun.", "NTA, but this does not bode well for your marriage. You\u2019d like to think you\u2019d be on the same page about such basic things before having a kid. Side note: *fianc\u00e9* refers to a male\u2014the female equivalent is *fianc\u00e9e*.", "NTA . She needs to get her  priorities in check . Can she afford to go on her own without you ?? If not she doesn\u2019t need to go . Can the god children come instead ??", "NTA. So she thinks you just have unlimited money you\u2019re already covering 80-90% of expenses and now she\u2019s getting annoyed of you saying no, yeah she\u2019s the ungrateful AH here.", "NTA - I can understand her wanting to travel before the baby comes but if it's not financially feasible then she can't go.  Can you afford for just her to go?", "NTA. You aren't the selfish one here.\n\n>I have more credit card debt than savings at the moment and need to focus on reducing it.\n\n>I lent her $2,000 recently to pay her income tax bill, which she promised to repay as soon as she could save up the money.\n\nThis isn't the time to be booking an expensive trip.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9e is not thinking practically about your overall finances and not coming to terms with reality. However, when she calms down, you both need to talk and possibly consider undergoing pre-marital counseling. If she is irresponsible about your finances now, consider it will get worse in the future.", "NTA. You're being responsible.", "NTA.  Your child will be expensive.  Saving money as we are on the cusp of a recession with a baby on the way is prudent.  It\u2019s always easier to spend money than earn it.", "INFO \n\nHow much will your trips to South Carolina end up costing you?", "NTA. You\u2019re being financially responsible and honestly it will be better in the long run. The baby needs things, bills have to be paid, child care expenses will happen and of course, there\u2019s the matter of trying to simply reduce your debt as to not struggle when other bills come in. Not to mention you said fianc\u00e9 so there\u2019s a wedding to pay for. \n\nShe\u2019s under the assumption (probably) that money is there so spend it and have fun since babies/children are allow to fly (?). People vacation with their children all the time.", "You two are not on the same page about spending habits.  It's the number 1 reason couples argue, fight, and break up.  NTA\nIf you can't afford it, you can't afford it.  Be careful, it sounds like you are with a high maintenance SO.  You two need to re-look at your spending split as you're essentially supplementing her ability to pay off her student loans and car.\n\nTell her to use her own money and travel alone.  You have bills to pay and a house to keep.", "NTA. She's an adult and she's capable of seeing her god-kids on her own. You being responsible of your own money is perfectly valid when you have a child on the way. The trip isn't essential, so her behaviour seems a little out of line.", "NTA if you are in credit card debt then you need to be paying it down before the baby comes.

It seems like you've been fine to come up with travel money in order to visit your family members, but you need to cut costs when she wants to visit her family. Saving money is very important right now but it does seem like a double standard.", "NTA, you guys are all ready in a tough financial spot and it would be dumb to make it worse before the baby is born. Your wife sound irresponsible.", "NTA\n\nAs lovely as a trip to Mexico would be, she's not being practical.  \n\nSometimes, being an adult is making the boring decision for the greater good. This is one of those times.", "NTA \nIf you can\u2019t pay for Mexico she shouldn\u2019t be getting mad you guys are having a baby and need to be financially stable but then again from her point of view I understand that she wants to do things before the baby arrives, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can get mad at you for not being able to afford going to Mexico", "NTA", "NTA, you have a perfectly reasonable perspective and aren't trying to prevent her from going. But she should cover her own way AND frankly I would be a bit pissed if she made that expense without at least partly paying you back for the loan. \n\nI think the division of household expenses and your spending/saving lifestyles ought to be a priority to sort out before the baby arrives.", "NO YOU ARE NOT you are very smart financially she will cool off and realize you did the smart thing also your life does not end when you have children they can travel it just takes a little more planning are god kids that important", "NAH - who knows. There\u2019s no way for us to really judge your finances.\n\nShe thinks its worth spending the money. You dont. Doesnt make either of you AHs", "NTA but you\u2019re getting married/have a kid and still have a mindset of \u201cher debt, my debt\u201d? It\u2019s all going to be BOTH of your debt.", "NTA - Your fianc\u00e9' needs a wakeup call. I'm sure she's a nice person, but she's manipulating you by calling you the selfish one when she's being selfish. Considering the amount of bills you pay, that you lent her money to pay her taxes, and have already taken several trips, I'd say your idea on saving and getting your credit card debt down should take precedence over anything else, especially with inflation rates skyrocketing. It seems to me that your fianc\u00e9 definitely needs a reminder of your finances, and she needs to be more responsible with her obvious spending issues before you both end up in trouble down the road. She's obviously not in a hurry to pay back what she already owes you.  You definitely seem to be the more responsible one with the finances.", "NTA but since you cover the huge majority of the bills does she know how much goes out how much is saved how much you have for \u201cfun\u201d money? She may need to sit down with you and see a break down of what money is coming in and going out.", "NTA. Unfortunate that you have a kid on the way because otherwise I would be suggesting you head for the hills.  IMHO you should not even be throwing around the money you already have until you have 0 debt.  \n\nyour inability to afford her trips is not your failure and if she wants them so bad than she can have them once she starts making enough money to afford them.   \n\n\nIts not like anyone is dying or you are missing some once in a lifetime moment.   \n\n\n>last chance to travel before the baby arrives. \n\noh the hue manatee.  anyone trying to get in a last X before Y most often either does not want  or is not ready for Y.  Same for bachelor parties and everything else.  you can find a babysitter when you do make that trip and it would be nice to recall that frivolous travel is a privilege and one should find contentment in the ability to go eventually at all.", "NTA", "NTA you are not your girlfriend\u2019s ATM", "NTA. Consider financial counseling or at least an income vs spending/debt analysis together with your wife. It sounds like you are living above your means and the incoming child will make things harder.", "NTA.\n\nYou would think she would understand basic finances even before having a child...", "Nta. She can pay for it herself. You clearly married someone that needs financial counseling. Put your foot down and simply say no. It's extremely stupid and illogical to go further into debt when you don't have to", "NTA. But if She wants to go, she should pay for it, not OP. He's paying enough things already, and she owns him $2000 already.\nThere is a baby coming in a few months to be considered as well, I don't believe it is wise to spend so much now.", "Last month we went together and after all expenses (hotel, car rental, food, etc.) ended up around 1,500.  For this upcoming trip I am going alone so I will only spend around $500 this time as I have asked for my uncle to let me stay at his home for the weekend I\u2019m there.  We had a trip planned to go my cousins wedding in August, but I told her I\u2019m thinking of canceling because the costs add up", "I paid for Denver, that was her birthday gift.  For south Carolina\u2019s I paid for all of it since we were going for my uncle birthday. So I thought it was fair since it was a event I wanted to go to.", "The trip to Denver was her birthday gift. I told her about it and planned it before we found out she was pregnant.  We found out we were going to be parents about 2 weeks before the trip", "Is he not welcome to have that double standard since he is the one paying for everything anyway?", "But she also owes him $2000.", "So you're spending as much, if not more, to take trips to see your family but not willing to spend the same to see hers. Being financially responsible is the right move but it seems like you're only applying that logic to her wants. \n\nYTA, you don't have to go to Mexico but it's past time to cancel your other trips.", "How often do you go to see her side of the family? I am just curious about that. Maybe it's something to think about and discuss with her. And like everyone said, maybe she can go and you stay behind as a compromise.", "I never trust these posts to be genuine and accurate tbh and we certainly never get the full picture. \n\nIts really above our paygrade", "But also NTA as he can pay for his own trips she owes him \u00a32000 and is essentially asking for him to pay for them to see her god kids. He pays to see his own family if she wants to see her god kids she should pay him back and then see them with her own money not expect him to help pay and ignore the fact that she thinks she can justify a holiday while owing money.", "He's only going on one trip and that's to help a relative set up his will.  I don\u2019t think that makes him an AH", "I was going to say the same thing, but you said way better than I could. Only her wants are frivolous, his are necessary, in his eyes. I hope she sees this. It\u2019s really hard to live with someone that discounts your needs while fulfilling their own.", "So her immediate family (parents, siblings) are here 30 mins away from us. We see them every other week or so.  Her family is Mexico is more like Aunts/Cousins/GodKids.   She hasn\u2019t seen them in 6 or 7 years.  The idea of going to visit them has really never come up until now.  \n\nI\u2019ve never spoken with any of them and she doesn\u2019t speak to them all that often anymore compared to a few years ago.\n\nI told her she could go with her mom, but she said I\u2019m being selfish for not wanting to go with them because she never asks for anything.", "Because she pays very few of their expenses and owes him $2000. They could afford the trip if she paid him back.", "Ohh in that case, this is a non-essential trip, and I agree with you about getting prepared for the baby and avoiding frivolous trips now, especially if it was not budgeted for. I think you should definitely sit with her and set budgets so that you both have an idea of what needs to be done, what trips you can take for the year etc etc. Makes life easier, especially with the baby. \nGood luck, and hopefully, you guys come to a good understanding."]}
