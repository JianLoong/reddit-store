{"id": 15015, "submission_id": "12peacj", "title": "AITA for keeping my parents wedding rings", "selftext": "My parents divorced when I was little and my dad passed away when I was 16. After he died, my siblings and I all took things from his house to remember him. I was the youngest (we are 7 in total) and didn\u2019t have the opportunity to take memory-filled furniture but my siblings did. He also had a watch collection and everyone took one. There was none left for me so I asked if I could take the wedding ring my dad had kept safe. They all said yes bc it was one of the only things I could take. Afterwards, my mum gave me her old wedding ring so that I have them both. I used both of them to put on a necklace that I wear (I could remove them from the necklace if I wanted to). Now, my sister asked me if she could have them because she wants to get married. I said no and now she, and one of my brothers, are calling me selfish. I don\u2019t actually plan on using them for marriage but I wanted them as a memory. My mum and other siblings agree with me but my sister and one brother say it\u2019s useless for me to keep it as a necklace. Am I being selfish?\n\nEdit:\n\n1. The reason why I couldn\u2019t get any furniture wasn\u2019t because they took everything without considering me. It was because at that time (16) I was still living with my mum in a small apartment and there was no space to put anything. My older siblings all had their own places and had space for them\n\n2. I doubt she wants them for money-reasons. She has a good job and the watch she took is worth far more than the rings I have. I think it\u2019s more about her just wanting them. Not sure what exactly she would do with them bc I doubt her husband-to-be wants my mum\u2019s name on his ring. She would have to melt them down and make new ones\n\n3. A comment she made during our argument: \u2018You were so young when they divorced (I was 6), why would you even need a memory of their marriage? You can barely remember them being married.\u2019 I told her that was one reason I wanted them but she called me childish and idiotic", "created_utc": 1681734697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12peacj/aita_for_keeping_my_parents_wedding_rings/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
