{"id": 15015, "submission_id": "12peacj", "title": "AITA for keeping my parents wedding rings", "selftext": "My parents divorced when I was little and my dad passed away when I was 16. After he died, my siblings and I all took things from his house to remember him. I was the youngest (we are 7 in total) and didn\u2019t have the opportunity to take memory-filled furniture but my siblings did. He also had a watch collection and everyone took one. There was none left for me so I asked if I could take the wedding ring my dad had kept safe. They all said yes bc it was one of the only things I could take. Afterwards, my mum gave me her old wedding ring so that I have them both. I used both of them to put on a necklace that I wear (I could remove them from the necklace if I wanted to). Now, my sister asked me if she could have them because she wants to get married. I said no and now she, and one of my brothers, are calling me selfish. I don\u2019t actually plan on using them for marriage but I wanted them as a memory. My mum and other siblings agree with me but my sister and one brother say it\u2019s useless for me to keep it as a necklace. Am I being selfish?\n\nEdit:\n\n1. The reason why I couldn\u2019t get any furniture wasn\u2019t because they took everything without considering me. It was because at that time (16) I was still living with my mum in a small apartment and there was no space to put anything. My older siblings all had their own places and had space for them\n\n2. I doubt she wants them for money-reasons. She has a good job and the watch she took is worth far more than the rings I have. I think it\u2019s more about her just wanting them. Not sure what exactly she would do with them bc I doubt her husband-to-be wants my mum\u2019s name on his ring. She would have to melt them down and make new ones\n\n3. A comment she made during our argument: \u2018You were so young when they divorced (I was 6), why would you even need a memory of their marriage? You can barely remember them being married.\u2019 I told her that was one reason I wanted them but she called me childish and idiotic\n\nSecond edit:\n\n1. I don\u2019t really want to trade it with something she took. I\u2019ve been wearing them on the necklace for almost 8 years now and I\u2019ve become even more attached to it. I usually don\u2019t take it off except I want to wear a fancier necklace for certain occasions/outfits. \n\n2. I had made a comment on how I don\u2019t understand why she wants to use the rings for getting married and she said it\u2019s because she has good memories of their marriage despite them getting divorced (tbf my parents ended things as friends so we don\u2019t really have bad memories about that time). I didn\u2019t tell her that I still don\u2019t really understand it (or kind of believe it) bc I knew she would tell me it\u2019s because I don\u2019t remember much to begin with\n\n3. Just for clarification: The ring isn\u2019t the only thing I have from my dad. I have a few small items (scarf, 2 books, a nice pen he always used and the mug he always drank coffee from) but none of my siblings were interested in them. They associated other things with him so back then we didn\u2019t really have much argument about who gets what. We actually never had any arguments (between all 7 of u; since we are adults) and this is the first time something like this happened.", "created_utc": 1681734697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12peacj/aita_for_keeping_my_parents_wedding_rings/", "score": 382, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems very unfair in general that someone didn\u2019t think, ah I can store this precious item for OP knowing that one day they would like something too.", "OP should stop giving reasons why she should keep the rings and turn attention to her sister\u2019s choices. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you are regretting choosing dad\u2019s watch over his ring\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you chose poorly when we divided Dad\u2019s things\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you regret your choice of heirloom, but these are mine\u201d  Stop defending yourself and drive home that she chose not to keep his ring. That was her choice and just because she regrets it now that doesn\u2019t make it your problem to fix.", "Filthy Siblingsis.", "This was the best response ever! Thanks for the laugh!", "Reddit humor at its absolute worst", "And then yell \u201cyou can\u2019t have them!\u201d And put them in your mouth.", "Cast it into the fire!", "Lmao good point. \"Yes you can have the rings, but only if you give them back after your divorce\"", "My mum was pretty firmly agreeing with me and telling her that they belong to me now and have for the past years. My sister isn\u2019t the first one of us getting married (3rd youngest) and it really came out of nowhere. She has seen me wear the necklace for years and never made a comment. And there is no stone to give. They are plain gold bands", "Yes, my dad passed away last year and he has multiple watches among other things. My dad got to meet my youngest great nephew a few days before he passed. My sister who was the executor, is keeping a watch to give to him. We are all broken into pieces, but we still had the mindset to have something for him. He will grow up hearing the stories about how awesome his great grandpa is.", "Yeah he needs to stop JADE ing... Justify Argue Defend Explain, stop doing those things to sis. The ring is his inheritance. End of story.\n\nOrrr he could lean into the gollum thing, every time she brings it up just start ranting about his precious in gollum voice , assume gollum posture and scamper away... The more I think about it, the more that seems the best option. Confuse her to the point she doesn't want it anymore", "Tell her Smeagol promised to Precious!", "I'm assuming you're British why do you guys say mum, but then y'all say mommy \ud83d\ude02. It confuses me so much. When I see the word mum I'm thinking of keeping quiet lol.", "Happy cake day!", "Thanks !", "On the off chance this isn't a hilarious take on Gollum, it's actually Isildur's quote, via good 'ol Gandalf. Also, NTA"]}
