{"id": 15015, "submission_id": "12peacj", "title": "AITA for keeping my parents wedding rings", "selftext": "My parents divorced when I was little and my dad passed away when I was 16. After he died, my siblings and I all took things from his house to remember him. I was the youngest (we are 7 in total) and didn\u2019t have the opportunity to take memory-filled furniture but my siblings did. He also had a watch collection and everyone took one. There was none left for me so I asked if I could take the wedding ring my dad had kept safe. They all said yes bc it was one of the only things I could take. Afterwards, my mum gave me her old wedding ring so that I have them both. I used both of them to put on a necklace that I wear (I could remove them from the necklace if I wanted to). Now, my sister asked me if she could have them because she wants to get married. I said no and now she, and one of my brothers, are calling me selfish. I don\u2019t actually plan on using them for marriage but I wanted them as a memory. My mum and other siblings agree with me but my sister and one brother say it\u2019s useless for me to keep it as a necklace. Am I being selfish?\n\nEdit:\n\n1. The reason why I couldn\u2019t get any furniture wasn\u2019t because they took everything without considering me. It was because at that time (16) I was still living with my mum in a small apartment and there was no space to put anything. My older siblings all had their own places and had space for them\n\n2. I doubt she wants them for money-reasons. She has a good job and the watch she took is worth far more than the rings I have. I think it\u2019s more about her just wanting them. Not sure what exactly she would do with them bc I doubt her husband-to-be wants my mum\u2019s name on his ring. She would have to melt them down and make new ones\n\n3. A comment she made during our argument: \u2018You were so young when they divorced (I was 6), why would you even need a memory of their marriage? You can barely remember them being married.\u2019 I told her that was one reason I wanted them but she called me childish and idiotic\n\nSecond edit:\n\n1. I don\u2019t really want to trade it with something she took. I\u2019ve been wearing them on the necklace for almost 8 years now and I\u2019ve become even more attached to it. I usually don\u2019t take it off except I want to wear a fancier necklace for certain occasions/outfits. \n\n2. I had made a comment on how I don\u2019t understand why she wants to use the rings for getting married and she said it\u2019s because she has good memories of their marriage despite them getting divorced (tbf my parents ended things as friends so we don\u2019t really have bad memories about that time). I didn\u2019t tell her that I still don\u2019t really understand it (or kind of believe it) bc I knew she would tell me it\u2019s because I don\u2019t remember much to begin with\n\n3. Just for clarification: The ring isn\u2019t the only thing I have from my dad. I have a few small items (scarf, 2 books, a nice pen he always used and the mug he always drank coffee from) but none of my siblings were interested in them. They associated other things with him so back then we didn\u2019t really have much argument about who gets what. We actually never had any arguments (between all 7 of u; since we are adults) and this is the first time something like this happened.", "created_utc": 1681734697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12peacj/aita_for_keeping_my_parents_wedding_rings/", "score": 942, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
