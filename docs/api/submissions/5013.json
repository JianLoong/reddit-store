If you were doing that yeah you'd be an asshole (I know what I am) but not in this situation.", "Is this actually a question? You're asking if you'd be the asshole for not allowing someone to use a service they're not paying for? Why is that even a question?", "NTA - unless he would like to contribute to costs the accounts are in your name attached to your finances so therefore you\u2019re not obligated to share.", "Nope, not a problem. In some places, the IP gets registered as \u201cnot being on site\u201d and external access gets blocked anyway. \nDo they still get access to water, utilities? No. Same as cable access then.

Dont even know why this is a question.  If they arent contributing to the service, they dont deserve passwords.", "NTA. But if you want to keep them as a friend, let them know you\u2019re changing the passwords since they are moving out. You could offer to continue to split the cost, if you actually wanted to. If not, and you don\u2019t care about the friendship, change it.", "NTA but you should just bring it up. If it was part of their rent arrangement with you before they might want to venmo you half a month to keep it. Maybe you can work out something equitable for everyone.", "No it's your personal account", "NTA.  What if this person also shares your passwords with others?  This is an EX room mate, not your child who is leaving home for college.  If everyone is adult enough to live on their own, they are adult enuf to pay for their expenses.  As far as those who have an opinion, they can give your ex-roomie THEIR passwords.  Next person who thinks you should, tell them you have notified your ex-roomie to hit them up.", "NTA\n\nThe services are part of a rental payment agreement. Once he leaves and isn't paying the rent then no longer has access to services.\nSame reason most places change the locks/key fobs when someone leaves.\n\nGive him a heads up though.", "NTA however just because your not doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t face blow back. I would give them a heads up to let them know \u201chey roommate just letting you know xyz services will be unavailable from date.\u201d Not just changing the password.", "This might get downvoted but YTA.\n\nIf their use of the service doesn't inhibit your use of the service whatsoever, by changing the password, you are basically trying to gatekeep a resource that is in reality infinitely replicable and unlimited in supply.  It would be like if you gave the tenant a cutting of your favorite plant to keep in their room, they grew the cutting into a new plant which also produced cuttings, and then you ordered them to surrender cutting and all its clones back when they moved out, for no other reason than that you don't want them to have it.  Why do you need it back?  You don't benefit from getting their cuttings back, because your original plant keeps cloning itself all on its own.  The roommates cuttings would just go in the trash.  You literally just took it away from them for no reason.", "I asked a few friends in private, and they said I was absolutely overdoing it. That's why I brought it to a more neutral group on Reddit, haha.", "My sentiments exactly-OP needs to just change his damn passwords and move on.", "He hasn't complained yet, but we're in the current stages of the \"what are you taking and what are you leaving\" convo. And, what's inevitably going to be a discussion about potential repairs or replacements of things. We're buddies, but this is just a normal thing when someone leaves. You end up sharing ownership of some stuff.\n\nLike... his dog destroyed my couch when he first moved in. He replaced the couch... which his dog destroyed again. Does he owe me a new couch? That's murky.", "I haven't talked to him about it yet. Honestly, he's supposed to have been giving me a side stipend he kept forgetting about for it anyways. I'm worried if I try to ask him to send me a monthly fee, he'll just never remember. And then, because of how streaming works, if we're splitting 50/50 and he has people over at his place, I want to watch something at my place, and the service kicks out... who wins?", "As I mentioned to another commenter, I've been told by friends that I'm being \"petty,\" and that if I wasn't going to otherwise cancel the service, that it's not actually costing me anything, so I should let them have it.", "Huh? This is such an odd take. The roommate has been paying for access to the services via rent. The roommate will no longer be paying rent when he moves out, thus he will be freeloading. These services aren\u2019t inaccessible. The roommate can just go make their own account and pay for it, if they want it. \n\nAs someone who still shares streaming services with my old roommates, I get wanting to stay on. However, as a realistic person, I wouldn\u2019t fault them for changing the passwords and would definitely go make my own account if I cared so much. \n\nOP has every right to change the passwords. \n\nNTA", "If you get a cutting from a plant, it doesn't die if you don't water the original plant. How long does OP continue to gift the subscriptions? Does OP need to approve verification each time they add a device? Is OP responsible for notifying them when the services end? There are so many tangles that are created by not having a clean cut-off. The roommate is an adult and can get their own services.", "I sincerely don't mean to argue with you since I know that's not part of the sub, I just don't think the analogy is apt. A plant growing on its own would be a gift that was completely separate from me in the future. This is something I'm constantly in charge of the maintenance of.", "How can they think that? As a roommate it makes sense as a shared household expense but how in God's name does it makes sense for you to bear that financial burden after your roommate moves out? I'm thinking you should never loan these particular friends money or invest in any business ventures of theirs. And you're definitely NTA.\n\n***edited for misspelling***", "Mistake #1 was asking friends.\n\nYou just do it. \n\nAnyone can lose access from someone else\u2019s streaming at anytime for any reason or no reason \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt is known!\n\nNTA", "He\u2019s got to contribute in return, have him take over one or more of the services and share them back to you or chip in some money.  Or he gets cut off.  NTA Wellcome to the real world, no free lunches.", "You were providing an additional service while he was paying rent. No more rent, no more streaming. Simple.", "Lol thats definitely not murky imo. I think your friendship makes it murky for you maybe. But if my pet destroys something then im responsible for it. Doesn't matter if I replaced it in the past. If I allowed my pet to destroy it again. I am responsible for replacing it. \n\nOn the other hand I share streaming accounts with a bunch of friends. If I'm paying for it anyway I don\u2019t see why I would have my friends give the company more money for the same service. Thats just me though.", "NTA. No reasonable person would think you owed them access to your subscriptions in perpetuity. The streaming services are in a bit of a crisis right now, hence the layoffs, adding of cheaper tiers full of ads, and price hikes on ad-free subscriptions.  Netflix has said publically (several times) that they will be cracking down on people that share their passwords; it's trivial for them to detect and enforce this.  Once they start -- and don't implode -- the other services will follow.\n\nPretty soon you will not be able to share your passwords anyway, and you'll be given the choice to switch over to a multi-user/household subscription (more $$) or be booted.  May as well keep it for your household only.", "I hate to break it to you, but when someone is regularly forgetting to give you money they promised to you on an ongoing basis\u2026they\u2019re not forgetting, they\u2019re taking advantage of you not following up about it. Your friends, in general, sound like they take advantage of you. You should probably reconsider some of these friendships.", "Okay, I just reread your post. I think I understand it now. The streaming services were included as part of his rent, but you were paying for the whole thing. And now you're still paying for the whole thing but he's moved out.\n\nYeah I think you're right for cutting him off. I mean if it's a perk of him living there that you threw in free streaming service, then why should he continue to use it? He can get his own service.\n\nNTA", "How is it not actually costing you anything if you previously were splitting the cost with the guy but now he's no longer paying for half? Or maybe I misunderstood.\n\nDid I misunderstand?", "Their argument is that I'd be spending the money on it anyways, so just let him keep it, instead of making an issue of it and compromising a friendship. Part of me understands it, but my hope would really be to get something equivalent back. My friends seem very willing to volunteer my money, but not send me/him any of *their* passwords.", "I guess by murky I would mean the price of a replacement. Does he owe me a couch of any kind, like one from Craigslist? Does he owe me a $3,000 set? Does he owe me the cost of the original couch when I bought it ten years ago? Did I contribute to any wear and tear? He's a good dude, I'm not trying to nickel and dime him.\n\nI also don't mind sharing streaming services within reason, but I'm paying $82.99 for the live TV bundle alone, not to mention everything else. If 5 of us chipped in $15 and shared services across like HBO, Paramount, Netflix, etc., I wouldn't have an issue sharing passwords.", "Yeah, it was like \"hey man, since you're living here, here's the logins to the streaming services.\" Like, they'd be on the common living room TV anyways, so I had no problem if he wanted to swing over to his bedroom and watch F1 while I watched football. \n\nIt certainly wasn't like \"hey I'm going to skip watching football and everything on live TV unless you pay 50% of the costs.\"", "That's a stupid argument. By that argument, sharing *anything* that you already have with *anyone* would be just fine--you're already paying for it, right? Just like utilities, wifi access, and the bedroom, it ends when tenancy ends.\n\nNTA, as long as it's when they move out (and, presumably, quit paying for their part).", "The thing is, it's against the terms of service to share with non-household members. Also, you only shared with one other person (your roommate) and are now, defacto, sharing with 2 other people (ex roomie & GF). Totally normal to change your passwords now.", ">Their argument is that I'd be spending the money on it anyways,\n\nThat's a stupid argument. \n\n*You already paying, so just post your streaming passwords here so very rando can use /s*", "I guess it depends on how long you've had the couch. If it was pretty new I'd say he owes you the cost of the couch. If it was older and had years of wear and tear then I'd say him going in half on a new (of relatively similar quality to the original) one would be fair. \n\nAnd 80 dollars for TV is expensive and its your account anyway so I dont think you would be TA for not paying for that. I do share my two streaming services with friends and a few others share theirs but none of us spend more than 20 dollars and when they start charging extra we likely will just go back to pirating.", "Yeah I think he's being a bit spoiled expecting you to continue to support his streaming services. I guess he needs to grow up a little bit and realize that you're not his daddy. LOL"]}
