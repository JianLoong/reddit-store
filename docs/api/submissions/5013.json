Why do you need it back?  You don't benefit from getting their cuttings back, because your original plant keeps cloning itself all on its own.  The roommates cuttings would just go in the trash.

This is such an odd take. The roommate has been paying for access to the services via rent. The roommate will no longer be paying rent when he moves out, thus he will be freeloading. These services aren\u2019t inaccessible.

No reasonable person would think you owed them access to your subscriptions in perpetuity. The streaming services are in a bit of a crisis right now, hence the layoffs, adding of cheaper tiers full of ads, and price hikes on ad-free subscriptions.  Netflix has said publically (several times) that they will be cracking down on people that share their passwords; it's trivial for them to detect and enforce this.  Once they start -- and don't implode -- the other services will follow.\n\nPretty soon you will not be able to share your passwords anyway, and you'll be given the choice to switch over to a multi-user/household subscription (more $$) or be booted.

The streaming services were included as part of his rent, but you were paying for the whole thing. And now you're still paying for the whole thing but he's moved out.\n\nYeah I think you're right for cutting him off.

My friends seem very willing to volunteer my money, but not send me/him any of *their* passwords.", "I guess by murky I would mean the price of a replacement. Does he owe me a couch of any kind, like one from Craigslist? Does he owe me a $3,000 set? Does he owe me the cost of the original couch when I bought it ten years ago? Did I contribute to any wear and tear? He's a good dude, I'm not trying to nickel and dime him.\n\nI also don't mind sharing streaming services within reason, but I'm paying $82.99 for the live TV bundle alone, not to mention everything else. If 5 of us chipped in $15 and shared services across like HBO, Paramount, Netflix, etc., I wouldn't have an issue sharing passwords.", "Yeah, it was like \"hey man, since you're living here, here's the logins to the streaming services.\" Like, they'd be on the common living room TV anyways, so I had no problem if he wanted to swing over to his bedroom and watch F1 while I watched football. \n\nIt certainly wasn't like \"hey I'm going to skip watching football and everything on live TV unless you pay 50% of the costs.\"", "That's a stupid argument. By that argument, sharing *anything* that you already have with *anyone* would be just fine--you're already paying for it, right?

Also, you only shared with one other person (your roommate) and are now, defacto, sharing with 2 other people (ex roomie & GF).

If it was pretty new I'd say he owes you the cost of the couch. If it was older and had years of wear and tear then I'd say him going in half on a new (of relatively similar quality to the original) one would be fair. \n\nAnd 80 dollars for TV is expensive and its your account anyway so I dont think you would be TA for not paying for that. I do share my two streaming services with friends and a few others share theirs but none of us spend more than 20 dollars and when they start charging extra we likely will just go back to pirating.", "Yeah I think he's being a bit spoiled expecting you to continue to support his streaming services.

Just tell him you are canceling the streaming accounts to save money.

Do people usually take advantage of you, are you known as being \u201cgenerous\u201d?", "NTA. Cut them off. Streaming services were included in the rent, so they end when rent payments end. Since there's no hard feelings with their leaving, you might want to explain that they're losing access to your accounts.", "NTA.\n\nBut if you want to go to better approach, just move to different account and stop paying for the previous ones.\n\nThis way it wouldn't be awkward, because you can say that you stopped paying for the \"mutual account\" because he moved out and you got better bundle for \"single users\".\n\nI don't know about where you live, but where I live it is the truth.

He needs to sign him and his gf up for their own services.\n\nMight be time to reset ALL passwords.", "NTA - it was included in their housing costs. They no longer live there. They can afford their own. Netflix is $12 a month, Prime is $100 a year, not sure with the others but they are included on phone plans and bundles so...

She gets nervous when alone and if we forget to block her off, she'll jump on the couch and try to \"fluff\" it like she does with blankets or whatever. There's some expected destruction here or there when owning an animal, so I'm not mad.\n\nBut, no, I wouldn't say I'm overly generous in comparison to my other friends. I will admit, I've let this roommate pay a lot lower than the average rent in my city currently, but that's because if he weren't my roommate, I wouldn't have one. We get along, my mortgage is dirt cheap, and so it was like why not just have someone fill up what would be an otherwise empty room, pay half of my mortgage, and look after the house when I'm gone?", "Well, let me put it this way, it's not like he could opt out of the streaming services and pay less rent. But of course the living room TV had it on there, so if he's living here and paying rent, it's not like I'm not going to share those passwords so he can go watch in his bedroom if he wants.   \n\n\nRent is a paltry $600/mo., and the combined amount of the streaming services I pay for is roughly $110/mo.

I bought the first couch like 11 years ago with the house, and he moved in after I'd had it for about 2 years.

Does he expect to keep them? \n\nChange the passwords the day he moves out.", "info- how soon is your roommate moving? is this like several months in the future and you\u2019re cutting off his access currently despite that you say it\u2019s built into his rent, or is he pretty much packed up and gone?", "They are responding to the part where you\u2019re living with a friend and not recognizing the complexity of the fact that your friend is also your renter and will soon be your former renter. \n\nYour friends who are telling you to keep them on are likely not as adapted to managing things like renters, sharing assets with friends when they are the asset holder, etc.\n\nGiven that they are a friend and you want to keep the friendship it probably doesn\u2019t hurt to give them the heads up rather than just cut them off (assuming you actually trust them as a friend). So, \u201csince you\u2019re no longer paying me rent you\u2019ll no longer have access to the streaming services that were included as a part of rent. I wanted to remind you in advance in case you have any shows you wanted to finish before losing access. Of course, you can always purchase your own. If you want me to extend it for a month after you move out for you to finish things I\u2019m happy to do so in exchange for some beer money.\u201d Again, that\u2019s assuming trust and more of a courtesy to a friend. \n\nIf the trust isn\u2019t fully there waiting until they move out and simply sending a text stating \u201cJust wanted to give you a heads up, I just changed the Netflix passwords since you\u2019re no longer living here. Didn\u2019t want there to be any confusion if you tried to log-in\u2026hope things are going well! I miss seeing you and would love to get together and catch up soon\u201d is also reasonable. \n\nYou\u2019re more likely to have small conflict and bad feelings if they just go to watch something they were in the middle of their first night after a stressful day of moving and discover you deleted them the second they walked out the door without a conversation. While you\u2019d be justified in doing so as a landlord, that\u2019s the kind of stuff that comes across as petty in a friend. Especially if they don\u2019t realize at first, keep trying to input passwords in a new device, are really looking forward to relaxing while watching a specific game, etc. You definitely don\u2019t need to offer that additional month, but it\u2019s worth them knowing why they suddenly can\u2019t log-in when they go to do it. Context matters for things like this, so if they discover it when they sit down with friends who helped them move and a pizza at tip off for their favorite team, you just became the cheap jerk among their friends even if you\u2019re justified and NTA whereas if they are told in advance even if you\u2019ve already cut them off just before telling them they can decide if they want to budget for their own and get the account set up or go to a local sports bar to see that one game instead. This is especially true because you discussed it with others already. So if your other friend decides that\u2019s the moment to say \u201cyeah they\u2019ve been talking about cutting you off for weeks, we told them not to\u201d something that really is a non-issue just became an issue. \n\nYour friends are wrong, you should absolutely cut them off. But it makes sense, because they are friends, to actually communicate about it rather than create a situation that will likely cause a very minor inconvenience for them because you\u2019re assuming they understand and remember that the streaming was included as part of the rent rather than something shared between friends. If they think of it as a \u201cfriend\u201d benefit rather than a \u201crenter\u201d benefit, they\u2019ll interpret it as a slightly passive aggressive move against your friendship.\n\nIf you do completely trust them and want to offer to split costs you could also offer to do that. So, \u201cright now, your rent has been covering access to the streaming services. Would you be interested in splitting the cost with me and still having access, or is it easier for you to just get your own?\u201d", "They said that because everyone wants free stuff and are ok with someone else being out the money.", "You can just ask if they want to cashapp you half the cost of the streaming services, then you all keep them even though they\u2019re leaving?", "Well I would still say NTA for changing the password but I wouldn't say that you included the price in his rent if the amount of rent he paid wasn't affected by the streaming services. \n\nThe way you've worded it in your post made it sound transactional already. But if you would have charged him $600 rent even if you didn't have the services then that's not strictly true. And I can understand your friends view a bit more. They saw the streaming services as a favour/nice gesture to your roommate, not an aspect of the rental agreement. \n\nYou saw (or now see) the streaming services as a utility like water and electricity. But normal rental contracts will state what is included in the rent bill wise and it doesn't sound like streaming services was explicitly mentioned. Also its slightly different because if he was to continue using the water/electricity he'd need continued access to the house but thats not the case with the streaming services. \n\nI think personally it would depend on if him using the service on his device(s) would inconvenience me in anyway. Like could I move to a cheaper rate with less devices or is there a limit on how many devices that would mean I couldn't share the password with someone else. Or is there a term of service which would be violated by sharing the service between multiple households that simply isn't worth the risk. Or can only one person use it at a time and being in multiple households its harder to manage. \n\nI think until it starts being an inconvenience then I wouldn't change the password. But if there's no inconvenience and you change the password anyway it still wouldn't rise to asshole level. I'd just say to be prepared for your friendships (with the roommate and the friends you consulted) to be a bit more transactional going forward.", "Thanks, I really liked the phrasing in the second section! I'm trying to think of how to phrase it like \"hey, I'm worried I'm going to get upcharged or blocked for sharing across households, and you know I don't check billing changes often, so I'm making a change in passwords proactively,\" in order to mitigate any hurt feelings.", "Even if you are spending money on it, it was considered part of their rent before. If they want to use it then they pay x amount or offer something, like another service, in trade. Otherwise it's something they lose access to when no longer a tenant. It's like a community pool, you don't live there you lose access.", "That's it there! They're afraid THEY'D be put in a position where they may have to \"help\". They're wrong, talk to your friend and ask him if he will need another week on the services or if you can discontinue the connection straight away when he moves out. \n\nI bet he'll be just fine. If however, he acted upset in the least...change them right away and give him space. Its really asinine to think he'd still have Access to those services without paying once he moves out!", "Thats even worse \ud83d\ude06", "Yeah my sister shares mine and i started getting charged more. She used to throw me like $6 a month since that would be the difference but now i use her HBO so we are even. But shes my sister, not a roommate or random friend.", "I would probably just approach it as  *of course* they\u2019re losing access to those accounts, the same  way you\u2019d lose access to a nice washing machine or an apartment complex fitness center when you move, and say \u201cHey,  I figured I\u2019d give you an extra couple of days to get your streaming services set up after the move, so I won\u2019t change the passwords till the third\u201d.  If they push back, you can point out that those services are all cracking down on shared passwords (or, frankly, that you\u2019re not comfortable sharing passwords outside of your immediate household.", "Don\u2019t give excuses as to why. You\u2019re doing it. That\u2019s a fact and they don\u2019t need to justification besides the reminder that they are no longer paying for it. Just give them a reminder the same way you remind them of anything else that happens when they move.", "Better ones too... these ones seem to be broken!", "INFO: Op have you asked your best friend soon to be former roommate if he is willing to pay you each month to keep the streaming services? If he says no, then let him know you'll be cutting him off. If he is really a good friend he'll say yes and problem solved. Either way, communication is key in any type of relationship.", "It is absolutely absurd that you would put stock in that person's opinion on this situation. Ridiculous.", "I haven't, but I don't want to run into any conflict about whose account it truly is if we both want to watch something.", "He's not the only one who has felt this way, he's just the most recent person I happened to ask before making this thread.", "OP did you never create a second profile?
