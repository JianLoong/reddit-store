So me 14f and my half sister 24f have never been close, she's my mother's first child and she have a pretty rocky relashionship with her for various reasons. \n\nI think she doesn't like me because her childhood was kinda bad and my mom had to sent her to her dad in another country because she couldn't take care of her anymore and on the other side my childhood was nice and peaceful, my mother was always there and when I was born she was more than financially stable and my dad has always been wealthy too so I had a phone younger than her, I did a lot of cool vacations etc.... She went to live with her father again around one year ago because she had a baby and could not afford high rent. \n\nThat being said, she came with her child around two weeks ago for vacation. So 2 days ago I went to the hair salon to get my hair done I have natural 4c hair so I took about five hours. This morning she went somewhere and we didn't see each other fir the whole morning. When I come back to the house at around 3pm, she is sitting in front the TV with my nice who's making a mess and when I go to the kitchen to take my first meal of the day I see that her and my niece already ate because she left dishes so I ate and washed only my dishes ( I used to wash everyone's plates but whenever she's doing the dishes she leaves out mine so I stopped doing her's) and went inside my room. And then I hear her calling me and be like \"oh gosh I sat again in one of your tuft of hair, ever since I came back I keep on siting on it, come pick em up\" and mind you I didn't even saw what the living room looked like I just ate and went straight to my room. \n\nAnd after she gets no response she come to my room and say \" did you hear me \" and I responded \"yeah but why can't you do it yourself\" and in a very angry/condescending tone she said \" because that's your hair \" wich I understand is a part of my body emission but I was kinda shocked that she waited until I came back to make ME clean because while she was clearly disturbed by it. And then she started saying she wasn't gonna do it and I said that I understood her point and I just said that because of wath I wrote earlier.I was even willing to do it but instead of coming back to talk to me gently about it she send a text to my mom who then asked me very politely and gently to do it with I did.\n\nTwo days later she stills bring this up and she told me that I was a snarky arrogant impolite and manipulative kid and that she wasn't gonna be one of the personn I was gonna manipulate. She also said that she talk on my back with a lot of family  members who all agree that I am impolite but the exact same family members she listed to me talk behind her back too so idk am I the biggest manipulative teenage girl in this family or she wrong? Because she said some very hurtful things and I can't help but question myself.", "created_utc": 1667576090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym24fd/aita_for_not_cleaning_my_hair/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like your sister is very immature for acting the way she did, she is 10 years your senior and her brain should be mostly developed at this point. I get that she has a rough childhood and you got the better version of your mom, but she needs to take that up with her and not you. Think about speaking with your mom about this, sounds like you all need some family therapy to work through this situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was incredibly rude about your hair (your hair sounds lovely to me considering you'd just had a 5 hour treatment at the salon) and she's been exceptionally rude about the dishes.  \n\nShe is jealous you had a better childhood.  She's jealous you had more time with mom.  These are things, as a child, you had no control over.  \n\nI would sit down with your mom and discuss what is going on with your sister and tell her how it makes you feel so hopefully you guys can work it out.\n\nIt her resentment and poor treatment continue counseling may be an option.\n\nSorry your sister is being a jerk.\n\nOfficial Verdict: NTA", "NTA.  This is so silly.  I have two sisters so I feel like I live in a house made of hair sometimes lol.  It can get frustrating when it gets on everything but for her to get so angry is ridiculous."]}
