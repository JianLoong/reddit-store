Has Becca's work ever looked like your work before?  Most artists have their own style and don't radically deviate from it that quickly.", "NTA.  The purpose of the investigation is to determine if a case exists.  Art styles are very personal.  I imagine you can show previous works building up to the final piece.  Can she?

Then go no contact with her.", "NTA. Some things are too much of a coincidence to actually be one. Go with your gut on this. I imagine you are not going to do this sort of thing lightly, since she is (was) your friend. But do not accept plagiarism.", "Do you have any  written proof ? E-mails  or scribbled notes? This could be hard to prove if she\u2019s been copying you all along .I wish you success OP but am concerned it will be hard to prove without \u201c body\u201d i.e.proof  she has your notebook.NTA OP for defending yourself .", "NTA. If it was a coincidence hopefully whatever \"trial\" they conduct will make that clear.", "It's not a coincidence and you know it.", "i mean\u2026 it sounds like you should trust yourself on this. you know your work. and presumably you have other evidence to demonstrate that it is yours. like you can talk about it, in detail. \n\ndon\u2019t ever feel guilty or bad for standing up for yourself. and if you plan to be an artist, you have to be ruthless in protecting your own intellectual property. \n\nNTA", "Welcome to the real world.  My daughter went for a Bachelor's of Fine Arts and she specialized in painting.  The theft of original ideas got so bad she stopped working in the studio on campus and worked out of her apartment.  Unless you can find the sketchbook, you will have a hard time proving your case.  In the art world, whoever markets it first, wins.  Fair?  No, but that is the way it is.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You had every right to act that way. You had a suspicion that your \u201cfriend\u201d was stealing your work and you acted accordingly. Good job for stepping up for yourself.", "NTA. That sounds like one hell of a coincidence. You need to take plagiarism seriously and collect any evidence (physical or digital) and claim your work.

But at the same time, you have at least circumstantial evidence that Becca plagiarized your work.  At this point, I say Garner your evidence and present it.", "There's no way she can \"accidentally\" plagiarize *that* much, hope you get the outcome you deserve op let us know how it goes!", "NTA if it is a cooincidence, it will be obvious from her own preliminary stetches. It also puts you in a sticky position where if you didnt raise it, your work could be accused of plagarism", "NTA for raising this concern. It sounds like there are WAY too many similarities for this to be any kind of an accident. Digital prints of your work?? That's not a coincidence or an imagination. \n\nSure it sucks but if Becca forged then it's better for her to be discovered now than later.", "I would openly draw and verbally express my ideas with her because we worked on lots of things together and would collaborate.

Mostly of the digital prints that I used in my book. The whole purpose of my book was to have physical copies of my ideas but I should have taken more pictures", "Even if you openly draw and discuss, each artist usually has their own style.  Even the same idea would appear differently by 2 different artists.  Unless one is a forger, of course.", "This is truly disturbing . Please \u2026.please update us on the outcome of the academic hearing ?   \nI hope you prevail . You know your own work , and your own concepts .
