She doesn't like any meat besides chicken, and she especially hates processed meats, like lunch meat and hot dogs. I'm fine with that, since it's not really all that good for her anyway. Buying nutritious foods she *does* like isn't hard for me to do, so I don't mind giving her the food she likes since it's easier on both of us.\n\nRecently there was a school holiday and I had to work, so I asked a family member to babysit her for one of those days. I offered to pack a lunch for Ella or leave some money with my family member, since I know how picky Ella is, but my family member said I didn't need to, that she had plenty of food. I said great, thanked her, and dropped Ella off for the day.\n\nI got a call in the afternoon saying that Ella wouldn't eat the hot dogs my family member had served for lunch and was complaining because she was hungry. I asked if my family member had peanut butter, and she said yes, so I said just make her a peanut butter sandwich and she'd be happy with that. Family member insists she shouldn't have to make something different when everyone else was happy eating hot dogs.\n\nI reminded her that I had offered to pack a lunch for Ella for this exact reason, and my family member said that I'm spoiling Ella by not making her eat what's she's given, that it's disrespectful, and that she's not always going to get her way when she's an adult in the real world. I told her that when Ella's an adult with her own money, she'd cook for herself and wouldn't buy food she didn't like anyway so that would be a non-issue, and I don't see a need to force her to eat things she doesn't like to assert my authority or whatever as long as she's getting the right nutrition, which she is.\n\nI told her a single peanut butter sandwich was not too much to ask and that I'd pay her for it, if she was so hung up on it.

Your family member is wrong. Pack a lunch for her in the future and keep encouraging her to try new things.", "NTA, you offered to provide other food that your daughter would eat. It's silly to say that as an adult she wouldn't be allowed to have a choice in what she's eating. As an adult, if I don't like something that's being served somewhere, I don't have to eat it, I can spend my own money to get something else. It's true that sometimes, like at a wedding, if you don't like anything that's there, you might have to wait until you get home to eat, but that's a choice an adult gets to make. If you hadn't informed her, or offered other alternatives, that would be different. But you made very clear from the beginning that this might be an issue, and she told you not to worry about it, that implies that she is willing to work around your daughter's issues.", "NTA, but family member sure is\n\nI was a \"picky eater\" as a child as well. Also hated processed meats and to this day I can't touch ham. As long as Ella has a healthy (if narrow) diet and she is willing to try new things, that's enough. She knows what she likes and what she doesn't, even if she can't express why (for me, it was the texture of ham - it would literally make me gag). Forcing someone to eat something they hate isn't being responsible, it's a power-play to enforce your authority/opinion on them, and it leads to neurotic behaviour in the children when they grow up.", "NTA \n\nI have 1 niece who is super picky. When we watch her I just make what I know she\u2019ll eat. A fed kid is best \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I also don\u2019t force my children to eat things they don\u2019t like. Do I have them try something once? Yup. But I don\u2019t push it if they don\u2019t like it. And asking for them to make a PB sandwich is not unreasonable at all, especially since they turned down money and a packed lunch for her.", "nta. you're the parent not this family member. It's up to you how you handle these situations. Next time ignore them and pack her a lunch.", "NTA - Making your kids eat food they dont like whether it be the taste or a sensory issue - isnt going to make them magically like them. Or appreciate them/you. As long as your kid has well enough balanced meals...who cares if there are certain foods they wont eat.", "NTA\u2026 you offered to provide or pay for a lunch for Ella. You encourage your daughter to try new things and then if she doesn\u2019t like them, she doesn\u2019t have to eat them.\n\nAs a parent, I see nothing wrong with this. In fact, I think it\u2019s an important lesson to learn that you should try new things to see if you like them or not. \n\nAlso, a peanut butter sandwich is the easiest thing in the world to make. A literal child could do it. Your family member seemed like they just wanted to argue about it.", "NTA- You offered to pack a lunch and pay for a change in food because you know she is picky. You encourage her to try new things, and tried to plan ahead for her needs. If they want to force their kids to eat whatever is served, that's their business, but they can't be upset with you when you set the expectation and attempted to provide for your child's picky eating.", "YTA. This thread is so strange. What kind of humans are we raising. This has got to be a strictly American problem. She can eat what is served as long as she doesn't have an allergy or skip a meal and be hungry. Her choice. I suspect she's picky because she has been allowed since birth to be. She literally has no idea she'll be ok if she eats food she doesn't care for because she has never had to be. \n\nSo yeah in this situation since you offered to pack your kid a meal knowing she's so picky, your family member should have accepted it. I think allowing a kid to be a picky eater is madness but I'd never force a kid to eat food if their parent doesn't. Their parent should IMO but I wouldn't if they don't. So then I guess ESH. But seriously, the fact that we have to cater to every whim of a child because it could be triggering or it's a sensory issue or you're teaching them they don't respect you or whatever the frick. Your kid eat what you give them.", "I would say NTA, especially since you offered to pack a lunch. The truth is that people do not force adults to eat food they don\u2019t like. Only children are given so little autonomy that we teach them to disregard their own bodies and force them to eat what they dislike. If an adult didn\u2019t like hot dogs and chose to abstain from hot dogs literally no one would care.\n\nElla eats foods that are healthy and that she enjoys and that\u2019s all that matters. I suppose next time, I would just insist on packing a lunch to avoid this happening in the future.", "Nta you gave options. They refused. They got the consequences. Honestly if my kid rather a peanut butter sandwich over a hot dog I'd be happy. Much healthier", "As an adult, in the real world, I DON'T eat anything I don't like! Neither do any other adults I know! Seriously it's beyond me why people still have this crazy idea of forcing children to eat things they don't like, it's insane. And it's exactly how you cause your children to have unhealthy relationships with food. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nI'm a picky eater. I have some sensory issues with food. \n\nI will try something new occasionally, but otherwise, if there's something I don't like, I simply won't eat it. I get the occasional comment, but I don't care anymore. I prefer not to be unwell trying to eat. \n\nYou have two options, always pack something your daughter will eat or don't let this family member baby sit again.", "NTA\n\n> I'm spoiling Ella by not making her eat what's she's given, that it's disrespectful\n\n**\"WON'T _SOMEONE_ RESPECT THE HOT DOGS?!?\"** /s", "NTA\n\nChildren will develop in their own time. Folks who want to force childcare just on a wierd power trip.\n\nIt is unnecessary.", "NTA here, I get it, and my kids are the same way.  They will grow out of the pickiness in most cases and it's not good force foods on kids.", "Totally NTA. Your family member is power tripping, abusive, and not at all empathetic.\n\nYou are awesome.", "NTA. God I can't stand people like that. I swear some people just like to make life difficult for kids. I have an autistic child, which pretty much inherently means a picky eater and this has been a constant battle. People constantly telling me to force him to eat food he doesn't like. It's sick and weird. Don't leave your daughter with this person again, it's not appropriate.", "NTA", "NTA.  \nI watch my aunt and uncle force their kids to eat and it has done nothing but give them unhealthy relationships with food.  \nShowing your child respect here is actually so important. You are not spoiling her, you are respecting her.", "NTA. You offered to send her with her own food and that was declined. And the argument about her not eating what she\u2019s given and how she won\u2019t always get her own way as an adult? I beg to differ. As adults we are not expected to eat foods we do not like. Depending on the situation, you find something you do like and give a polite \u201cno thank you\u201d to what you do not like.", "NTA. As long as no one is harmed it's \"your kid, your rules\". If your kid is upset then explain to her that this family member weren't really trying to parent her, they were trying to parent you. Because they disagree with the rules you've set. It's important that she knows she's not the problem.", "NTA. And it would have taken your family member considerably less time to make a peanut butter sandwich for her than it did to call you and complain about your daughters eating habits.", "NTA. I also hated hot dogs as a kid and guess what? My mom knew this and fed me before/after birthday parties etc and I turned out quite alright (I think).\n\nForcing kids to eat foods that they genuinely don\u2019t like is weird and wrong. Your family member is TA.", "NTA wtf lol. My parents tried to force me to eat foods I didn't like and wouldn't let me leave until I ate it. I would put 2 chairs together and sleep at the table until it was night time. Guess what. I still fkn hate tomatoes... You are a good parent and as long as she agrees to at least try new food and she's getting all her vitamins that's what matters. Good parenting", "I'm going against the grain and I don't care who likes it. I don't have to adopt the opinion of the majority just to fit in on any post. \n\nYTA. ONLY because you know this child is picky and you didn't send food that she would eat along with her. Next time pack her a lunch, or make sure you are clear about what she will and will not eat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Since people here need a mile of fine print I will clarify. Instead of asking about sending a lunch or money for buying food you should have just sent the food that you know your child will eat, skipping the whole debacle. You chose to trust that they would be able to accommodate your child and that is where you went wrong. And knowing how picky she is that is where your error lies.", "NTA. This is how you help a child develop healthy eating habits. I was a picky eater, yet my mom tried the \"just one taste\" rule (offering one bite and if I refuse after, I'm not forced to eat it) and it really helped me develop a palate and healthy eating habits later in life. There's many stories I've heard where being force-fed as a picky child made people develop disordered eating later on. I'm glad you stood your ground, you're not spoiling her at all.", "NTA. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times growing up that I threw up because I was forced to eat a food that WRECKED my brain due to the sensory issues. This person doesn\u2019t care about you raising a person who will one day be an adult. They just want obedience.", "NTA my daughter and I had an understanding from a young age \ud83d\ude02 she would take two bites of a new food and if she did not like she did not have to eat unless she chose to try again in the future and guess what. My 20 year old loves many different foods because she was always willing to \u201csuffer\u201d those 2 bites knowing it will not be forced on her if she does not like. She has traveled with me extensively and loves many different ethnic type foods because again 2 bites. You are not \u201cspoiling\u201d her because she does not like lips and ah meat. Good job mom she will have a healthy relationship with food even if she limits it because she does not like.", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s 7! She isn\u2019t your relatives kid. She was told she was picky.

You tried to inform everyone, and it\u2019s not your fault that they didn\u2019t listen. \n\nI myself have been and still am a picky eater. Now that I\u2019m an adult I do exactly what you said she\u2019d do. I buy food I like, eat at restaurants I like and if I don\u2019t like something I just won\u2019t eat it. Forcing someone to eat food they don\u2019t like/can\u2019t eat for whatever reason (sensory issues, allergies, etc) is just mean.  \nYou\u2019re the one being respectful!! I wish more parents were respectful of their children\u2019s preferences", "NTA. Especially if your daughter has sensory issues. I can't find the articles quickly, but there's new research that suggest children experience taste more strongly than adults. Once upon a time this helped them avoid potentially poisonous food. Anyhoo, the gist of that that is that tastes may change later in life and there are foods kids don't like because they really do taste awful as a child. \n\nYou offered to prevent the problem. Blind obedience doesn't make for good adults, your kiddo wasn't being a brat, you're providing for her nutritional needs.

You literally offered to do something to avoid the situation and the sitter said no. Seems to me like that was them offering to accommodate your daughter\u2019s preferences.

As someone who really struggles with food textures and finding things I can eat without gagging, I appreciate your understanding for your daughter.

When he became a dad, people gave him so much crap for \u201cspoiling\u201d his kid. And I questioned it too, but quietly in 1 on 1 conversations. But you know what he helped me realize? The crap that a lot of us older people grew up with, including the \u201ceat what\u2019s in front of you or do without\u201d BS, actually made us question our bodily autonomy. It made us think our opinions don\u2019t matter. It showed us that we didn\u2019t deserve to be treated with respect. And many of us, probably like your antagonist OP, continued this parenting style with our own kids, refusing to show them any respect because \u201cthey\u2019re just kids\u201d. My coworker\u2019s kid is learning first hand from her dad how she should expect to be treated by a partner, with RESPECT. And that kid is a smart, confident, well-liked pre-teen today.", "NTA - I was prepared to go either way. I have a 20yr old niece that was a \u201cpicky eater\u201d and now only eats carbs.

Those are the things that matter.", "Does your family member has children? NTA. They is no point forcing someone to eat something they don\u2019t want to. That\u2019s how unhealthy relationships with food can start. You offered to pack a lunch and the family member said no. You are not in the wrong here", "NTA\n\n\"Its not your place to decide if I'm spoiling my daughter. I told you I would pack her a lunch if this would be a problem, you declined. Why did you decline? You planned on trying to force her food I didn't want her to have? Who do you think you are?\"", "NTA, they were aware, you offered to pack a lunch and hot dogs are crap food anyway. And you're not asking for her to cook a meal (which really the hot dog took zero effort) . You just asked her to make a sandwich. Hardly making a new meal. \nJust tell her your kid won't eat unhealthy junk food becaue she cares about her health!! \nWhat a dumb thing to get upset about especially since shebwas fully aware. I guess next time wherever she goes send her with a \"just in case\" lunch", "Nta\n\nMy son was such a picky eater, it was really difficult because I worried about his health,\nI talked to his doctor and he kept saying he will eat.\nFast forward he's a adult, learned to cook what he likes and actually eats more of a variety of foods than me,\n\nYour family member pisses me off, your being a great parent, keep it up,", "NTA My son was a picky eater as well.  I never forced him to eat anything, don't believe in it.  When he was about 13, he and I went on a cruise with family.  After the first night he chose to go to dinner on his own and every night would order every single entr\u00e9e on the menu and tried them all.  Some things just come with maturity.  She may be a picky eater forever,  but what does it matter in the scheme of things?", "NTA.  You offered to pack a lunch, so it's not like this family member didn't have options, and wasn't forewarned.  Family member sounds like an authoritarian, and that doesn't usually work all that well in the long term. When adults have food wars with kids, they aren't usually really about food, they're about control on one side or the other, and they usually just make everyone miserable to no purpose.  Sometimes picky can become a bit of a problem thing as an adult -- I have known adults who won't eat anything but chicken nuggets and Kraft Mac and Cheese, and I have no idea why they don't have scurvy (actually, that assumes facts not in evidence) -- but usually people explore on their own, and end up with broader palates as adults.  Having something in the house that kiddo will eat, and expecting them to make any alternate food themselves (PBJ or whatever, when they're old enough) is usually a pretty good natural limit - kid doesn't have to eat something they don't like, parent doesn't end up playing dinner roulette every night.", "NTA my wife is picky too so I have to do stuff like this all the time and never buy her stuff she hates you offered to pack a lunch or give her money so that's on her.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who was also a picky eater as a kid, you're doing the absolute correct thing for your daughter. Encouraging trying new things is great, and if she doesn't like 'em, don't serve 'em again. That's awesome! Also, if the family member knew that your daughter didn't like meat, but served hot dogs anyway, that is 100% on them. A family can't supplant the needs of one member just to have a \"more enjoyable\" or \"easier\" experience for the rest. Every member of the family needs to be accommodated no matter what their needs are. If you don't do that, then some really bad tensions can happen (believe me I know). Tl; dr You're not an AH, you're a great parent. Also that whole \"not eating what you're given\" thing is BS. As the host of a family event, *they* should be the ones accommodating ALL of their guests.", "NTA.  Force feeding kids causes trauma and it makes food problems worse in adulthood, not better.  I know from experience", "NTA. I was a so-called picky eater as a child. My father was in the military and would try to force me to eat things that absolutely made me gag. I would be left seated at the dinner table by myself in front of my increasingly cold and unappetizing plate while the rest of the family got on with their evening, and when he got frustrated enough at my refusal to eat he would spank me. I still struggle with an aversion to unfamiliar foods and an over-reliance on familiar comfort foods. I swore I would never get into power struggles over food with my kids, and they have both grown up to be far more adventurous eaters than I will ever be -- I'm so impressed with them, and I envy their openness to new foods. It's reasonable to encourage kids to try a bite of something new, but trying to force them to eat things that disgust them just sets them up for a lifelong problematic relationship with food.", "Nta.\n\nI'm assuming this family member is probably a boomer but I could be wrong. They completely undermined you as a parent, refused to let Ella eat a packed lunch, and knew what they were getting into. Yet, they still have the audacity to criticize you when you laid it all out for them. \n\nOne thing I hated as a child was being forced to eat food that I did not like.
