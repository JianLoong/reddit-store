Buying nutritious foods she *does* like isn't hard for me to do, so I don't mind giving her the food she likes since it's easier on both of us.\n\nRecently there was a school holiday and I had to work, so I asked a family member to babysit her for one of those days. I offered to pack a lunch for Ella or leave some money with my family member, since I know how picky Ella is, but my family member said I didn't need to, that she had plenty of food. I said great, thanked her, and dropped Ella off for the day.\n\nI got a call in the afternoon saying that Ella wouldn't eat the hot dogs my family member had served for lunch and was complaining because she was hungry. I asked if my family member had peanut butter, and she said yes, so I said just make her a peanut butter sandwich and she'd be happy with that. Family member insists she shouldn't have to make something different when everyone else was happy eating hot dogs.\n\nI reminded her that I had offered to pack a lunch for Ella for this exact reason, and my family member said that I'm spoiling Ella by not making her eat what's she's given, that it's disrespectful, and that she's not always going to get her way when she's an adult in the real world. I told her that when Ella's an adult with her own money, she'd cook for herself and wouldn't buy food she didn't like anyway so that would be a non-issue, and I don't see a need to force her to eat things she doesn't like to assert my authority or whatever as long as she's getting the right nutrition, which she is.\n\nI told her a single peanut butter sandwich was not too much to ask and that I'd pay her for it, if she was so hung up on it.

Your family member is wrong. Pack a lunch for her in the future and keep encouraging her to try new things.", "NTA, you offered to provide other food that your daughter would eat. It's silly to say that as an adult she wouldn't be allowed to have a choice in what she's eating. As an adult, if I don't like something that's being served somewhere, I don't have to eat it, I can spend my own money to get something else. It's true that sometimes, like at a wedding, if you don't like anything that's there, you might have to wait until you get home to eat, but that's a choice an adult gets to make. If you hadn't informed her, or offered other alternatives, that would be different. But you made very clear from the beginning that this might be an issue, and she told you not to worry about it, that implies that she is willing to work around your daughter's issues.", "NTA, but family member sure is\n\nI was a \"picky eater\" as a child as well. Also hated processed meats and to this day I can't touch ham. As long as Ella has a healthy (if narrow) diet and she is willing to try new things, that's enough. She knows what she likes and what she doesn't, even if she can't express why (for me, it was the texture of ham - it would literally make me gag). Forcing someone to eat something they hate isn't being responsible, it's a power-play to enforce your authority/opinion on them, and it leads to neurotic behaviour in the children when they grow up.", "NTA \n\nI have 1 niece who is super picky. When we watch her I just make what I know she\u2019ll eat. A fed kid is best \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I also don\u2019t force my children to eat things they don\u2019t like. Do I have them try something once? Yup. But I don\u2019t push it if they don\u2019t like it. And asking for them to make a PB sandwich is not unreasonable at all, especially since they turned down money and a packed lunch for her.", "nta. you're the parent not this family member. It's up to you how you handle these situations. Next time ignore them and pack her a lunch.", "NTA - Making your kids eat food they dont like whether it be the taste or a sensory issue - isnt going to make them magically like them. Or appreciate them/you. As long as your kid has well enough balanced meals...who cares if there are certain foods they wont eat.", "NTA\u2026 you offered to provide or pay for a lunch for Ella. You encourage your daughter to try new things and then if she doesn\u2019t like them, she doesn\u2019t have to eat them.\n\nAs a parent, I see nothing wrong with this. In fact, I think it\u2019s an important lesson to learn that you should try new things to see if you like them or not. \n\nAlso, a peanut butter sandwich is the easiest thing in the world to make. A literal child could do it. Your family member seemed like they just wanted to argue about it.", "NTA- You offered to pack a lunch and pay for a change in food because you know she is picky. You encourage her to try new things, and tried to plan ahead for her needs. If they want to force their kids to eat whatever is served, that's their business, but they can't be upset with you when you set the expectation and attempted to provide for your child's picky eating.", "YTA. This thread is so strange. What kind of humans are we raising. This has got to be a strictly American problem. She can eat what is served as long as she doesn't have an allergy or skip a meal and be hungry. Her choice. I suspect she's picky because she has been allowed since birth to be. She literally has no idea she'll be ok if she eats food she doesn't care for because she has never had to be. \n\nSo yeah in this situation since you offered to pack your kid a meal knowing she's so picky, your family member should have accepted it. I think allowing a kid to be a picky eater is madness but I'd never force a kid to eat food if their parent doesn't. Their parent should IMO but I wouldn't if they don't. So then I guess ESH. But seriously, the fact that we have to cater to every whim of a child because it could be triggering or it's a sensory issue or you're teaching them they don't respect you or whatever the frick. Your kid eat what you give them.", "I would say NTA, especially since you offered to pack a lunch. The truth is that people do not force adults to eat food they don\u2019t like. Only children are given so little autonomy that we teach them to disregard their own bodies and force them to eat what they dislike. If an adult didn\u2019t like hot dogs and chose to abstain from hot dogs literally no one would care.\n\nElla eats foods that are healthy and that she enjoys and that\u2019s all that matters. I suppose next time, I would just insist on packing a lunch to avoid this happening in the future.", "Nta you gave options. They refused. They got the consequences. Honestly if my kid rather a peanut butter sandwich over a hot dog I'd be happy. Much healthier", "As an adult, in the real world, I DON'T eat anything I don't like! Neither do any other adults I know! Seriously it's beyond me why people still have this crazy idea of forcing children to eat things they don't like, it's insane.

I have some sensory issues with food. \n\nI will try something new occasionally, but otherwise, if there's something I don't like, I simply won't eat it. I get the occasional comment, but I don't care anymore. I prefer not to be unwell trying to eat. \n\nYou have two options, always pack something your daughter will eat or don't let this family member baby sit again.", "NTA\n\n> I'm spoiling Ella by not making her eat what's she's given, that it's disrespectful\n\n**\"WON'T _SOMEONE_ RESPECT THE HOT DOGS?!?\"** /s", "NTA\n\nChildren will develop in their own time. Folks who want to force childcare just on a wierd power trip.\n\nIt is unnecessary.", "NTA here, I get it, and my kids are the same way.  They will grow out of the pickiness in most cases and it's not good force foods on kids.", "Totally NTA. Your family member is power tripping, abusive, and not at all empathetic.\n\nYou are awesome.", "NTA. God I can't stand people like that. I swear some people just like to make life difficult for kids. I have an autistic child, which pretty much inherently means a picky eater and this has been a constant battle. People constantly telling me to force him to eat food he doesn't like. It's sick and weird. Don't leave your daughter with this person again, it's not appropriate.", "NTA", "NTA.  \nI watch my aunt and uncle force their kids to eat and it has done nothing but give them unhealthy relationships with food.  \nShowing your child respect here is actually so important. You are not spoiling her, you are respecting her.", "NTA. You offered to send her with her own food and that was declined. And the argument about her not eating what she\u2019s given and how she won\u2019t always get her own way as an adult? I beg to differ. As adults we are not expected to eat foods we do not like. Depending on the situation, you find something you do like and give a polite \u201cno thank you\u201d to what you do not like.", "NTA. As long as no one is harmed it's \"your kid, your rules\". If your kid is upset then explain to her that this family member weren't really trying to parent her, they were trying to parent you. Because they disagree with the rules you've set. It's important that she knows she's not the problem.", "NTA. And it would have taken your family member considerably less time to make a peanut butter sandwich for her than it did to call you and complain about your daughters eating habits.", "NTA. I also hated hot dogs as a kid and guess what? My mom knew this and fed me before/after birthday parties etc and I turned out quite alright (I think).\n\nForcing kids to eat foods that they genuinely don\u2019t like is weird and wrong. Your family member is TA.", "NTA wtf lol. My parents tried to force me to eat foods I didn't like and wouldn't let me leave until I ate it. I would put 2 chairs together and sleep at the table until it was night time. Guess what. I still fkn hate tomatoes... You are a good parent and as long as she agrees to at least try new food and she's getting all her vitamins that's what matters. Good parenting", "I'm going against the grain and I don't care who likes it. I don't have to adopt the opinion of the majority just to fit in on any post. \n\nYTA. ONLY because you know this child is picky and you didn't send food that she would eat along with her. Next time pack her a lunch, or make sure you are clear about what she will and will not eat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Since people here need a mile of fine print I will clarify. Instead of asking about sending a lunch or money for buying food you should have just sent the food that you know your child will eat, skipping the whole debacle. You chose to trust that they would be able to accommodate your child and that is where you went wrong. And knowing how picky she is that is where your error lies.", "NTA. This is how you help a child develop healthy eating habits. I was a picky eater, yet my mom tried the \"just one taste\" rule (offering one bite and if I refuse after, I'm not forced to eat it) and it really helped me develop a palate and healthy eating habits later in life. There's many stories I've heard where being force-fed as a picky child made people develop disordered eating later on. I'm glad you stood your ground, you're not spoiling her at all.", "NTA. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times growing up that I threw up because I was forced to eat a food that WRECKED my brain due to the sensory issues. This person doesn\u2019t care about you raising a person who will one day be an adult. They just want obedience.", "NTA my daughter and I had an understanding from a young age \ud83d\ude02 she would take two bites of a new food and if she did not like she did not have to eat unless she chose to try again in the future and guess what. My 20 year old loves many different foods because she was always willing to \u201csuffer\u201d those 2 bites knowing it will not be forced on her if she does not like. She has traveled with me extensively and loves many different ethnic type foods because again 2 bites. You are not \u201cspoiling\u201d her because she does not like lips and ah meat. Good job mom she will have a healthy relationship with food even if she limits it because she does not like.", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s 7! She isn\u2019t your relatives kid. She was told she was picky.

You tried to inform everyone, and it\u2019s not your fault that they didn\u2019t listen. \n\nI myself have been and still am a picky eater. Now that I\u2019m an adult I do exactly what you said she\u2019d do. I buy food I like, eat at restaurants I like and if I don\u2019t like something I just won\u2019t eat it. Forcing someone to eat food they don\u2019t like/can\u2019t eat for whatever reason (sensory issues, allergies, etc) is just mean.  \nYou\u2019re the one being respectful!! I wish more parents were respectful of their children\u2019s preferences", "NTA. Especially if your daughter has sensory issues. I can't find the articles quickly, but there's new research that suggest children experience taste more strongly than adults. Once upon a time this helped them avoid potentially poisonous food. Anyhoo, the gist of that that is that tastes may change later in life and there are foods kids don't like because they really do taste awful as a child. \n\nYou offered to prevent the problem. Blind obedience doesn't make for good adults, your kiddo wasn't being a brat, you're providing for her nutritional needs.

You literally offered to do something to avoid the situation and the sitter said no. Seems to me like that was them offering to accommodate your daughter\u2019s preferences.

As someone who really struggles with food textures and finding things I can eat without gagging, I appreciate your understanding for your daughter.

I\u2019m just glad that OP advocates for Ella in these situations.", "> I reminded her that I had offered to pack a lunch for Ella for this exact reason", "No op reminded them and offered to pay for lunch or to pack a lunch for her", "No, OP let them know beforehand and offered to pack a lunch for her or to buy her one", "Op offer, why is it her fault her family members refused?", "I am aware. HOWEVER, she should have simply just sent food with her child instead trusting the relative would accommodate.", "Tell me then, did she make an effort to let the relative know what the child will and will not eat? Or did she simply assume there would be no issue with out covering all the bases?", "No. I think you fail to understand what I am saying. Let me be clear. It is my opinion that knowing her child she should have packed her child's food no questions asked. I know she asked if she should send a lunch or money and was turned down. I am saying she knows her kid and should have skipped this whole song and dance. The \"committed to making sure the child was fed\" without being informed of what the child would not be eating.", "That's after the fact. The commas around \"since I know how picky Ella is\" when she first explained the offer made me think it was being included to explain to us and not reporting what OP told the host at the time.", "Reading it I thought OP offered to pay/provide lunch without saying it was because the child was picky and the host might have assumed she was doing it so they weren't out of pocket. \n\nIf they did communicate it then the host is definitely in the wrong.", "The family member doesn\u2019t live with her daughter on a day to day basis, and probably doesn\u2019t know the full list of what the daughter will and will not eat.  The OP knows daughter is super picky, enough that OP suggested packing a lunch, but OP also didn\u2019t ask if \u201cplenty of food\u201d included items daughter would eat or offer suggestions that daughter would eat.  If packing a lunch was too difficult for OP, it isn\u2019t hard to say something like \u201cdaughter loves PB&J for lunch\u201d to set some expectations for the family member ahead of time.  But instead family member was surprised, and had to make a second lunch because daughter wouldn\u2019t eat the first one.", "Op probably would have been called ah and disrespectful for doing that", "Wow", "Why? she's a mind reader? She trusted her relative when she said no need to pack it.", "Maybe there is just a cultural difference at play here.\n\nFor me, if I\u2019m agreeing to watch a child known to be a picky eater and the parent offers to pack them a lunch and I refuse, I feel that I am implicitly agreeing to ensure that child is fed despite their picky tendencies. If I was in the relative\u2019s shoes I would interpret packing the lunch as covering the bases.\n\nMoreover the relative HAS food to provide Ella, she just doesn\u2019t want to prepare it for her. OP even offered to reimburse her for the cost of the peanut butter sandwich. The relative is digging in their heels because they don\u2019t think children deserve autonomy over their own food choices.", "Now that\u2019s just silly.", "It was communicated that she didn't eat most meats besides chicken before the fact.", "Yea no op edited. Her family member knew ahead of time that her daughter didn\u2019t like hot dogs/meat. The family member didn\u2019t care and wanting to force op daughter to eat. Probably because they believed children should obey adults like trained pets", "\"She trusted her relative\". I am saying that is the error. Have a nice day.", "Culture is irrelevant.  I have been babysitter to many children in my life. If a parent mentioned their child being picky, or if it's a child I wasn't sure about the food they like (relative or otherwise) I asked what the child likes to eat, and then make sure I have the food items on hand, or if a parent says they want to send a lunch or snack so the child could certain foods I accepted. \n\nKnowing you have a picky child and assuming someone will accommodate if you have not specifically discussed the food list is a judgmental error. Not a cultural one. It was never said in the post that she discussed the foods this child will eat. You really think it's not an important piece to this situation?", "No, it isn't. It's using good sense. A parent who knows their child should take measures period. Skip the questions and just send some food with the child. If you think that's silly then carry on.", "Have updated my original comment.", "Culture of communication, not culture of origin. Some people are brought up to insist on things like packing a lunch, or to try to guess peoples\u2019 true motives, whereas others are brought up to believe what they are told. The family member in this instance didn\u2019t do any of the things you are describing. They turned down the packed lunch, and also did not follow up to figure out what foods Ella did or didn\u2019t like. In your own description you would not put the full responsibility on the parent, you would work with the parent to make sure Ella was fed.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously fine you have a difference of opinion I just don\u2019t understand how someone can be TA for taking someone at face value the way she did. I feel like at worse it would be E S H. I voted N T A because it seemed like the relative had an axe to grind about Ella having food preferences, and OP was very quick to come up with a manageable solution (the PB sandwich).", "Packing a lunch is not a guarantee either. This family member, based on OP\u2019s description, was more concerned with controlling what the child ate than ensuring the child ate. It is not out of the realm of possibility that the family member would have refused to serve the packed lunch, especially if there were other children present and the meals would have been substantially different.", "Because she should know better. As a picky eater herself she ought to for sure know better. And further, not mentioning what her child absolutely will not eat. Why do you think that part is unimportant?", "It is if the mother packs what she knows for a fact her child will eat. If she sends the food and the relative refuses to feed her said food, that makes the relative the asshole.", "The edit clarifies that she did tell the relative what the kid won\u2019t eat, though. That\u2019s why it seems like the relative was just on a power trip.", "You assume I have had time to see that there was an edit while answering all my hate mail."]}
