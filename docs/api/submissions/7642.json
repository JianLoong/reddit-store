Call me irrational but that's one of my biggest \"fears\" when it comes to cooking.\n\nNow, while I think you should tell her that it wasn't good, you cannot simply say \"it sucked\". That's not helpful. She can't improve with such a statement, it will only put her down and demotivate her. You can say that it wasn't great and then tell her what you didn't like about it and what she can improve for next time in a polite way.

Seriously, you might have ruined cooking as a potential hobby for her forever and you probably did lasting damage to her confidence and motivation to try out new things.
