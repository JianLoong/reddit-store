He is a good dad. Now here comes the issue he got married to a female (35F) in February 2023. To start off the issues she didn\u2019t want our son (10M) to go to the wedding. I let my ex know that our son is old enough to know he isn\u2019t invited to such a big event. He ended up having him go. She wasn\u2019t happy about this. She has 3 children 12M, 10M, and 8M. She hasn\u2019t raised them though her sister has been the one raising them and they don\u2019t call her mom. Well when my ex and her moved into a house she had moved her kids in with her. My son went over on his dads weekend and they had an incident where her 8 year old pulled a knife on my son. I went and picked him up and after this she messaged me letting me know I am In contempt of court and that my child is super disrespectful and a lot of other stuff. Her and I had an amicable relationship before this. Then we decided my son would only go over there when her children weren\u2019t there. Next situation he was at his dads and he had to bring him home early because his ex wife got into a heated argument with her sister. Then this last situation, I went to drop off my son and they had gotten a dog. (They have a ring camera) well I was petting the dog out side the front door my ex allowed this and she went off on my on the ring camera and called the cops on me for petting the dog. After this situation he has not been allowed over to his house around her. A lot more has obviously happened, but now he doesn\u2019t get to see his dad as much and if he does it\u2019s for a few hrs on the weekend.

I cannot believe your ex married this woman, let along stayed with her after one of her children pulled a knife on your son. You need the get the custody agreement revised. That house (not a home) is not a safe place for your son, or even her own children who don\u2019t even call her mom. Your ex has invited a very dangerous situation into your lives by marrying this woman. You\u2019re going to have to do the heavy lifting here because your ex is useless. \n\nSorry to say that whatever good co-parenting relationship you had went out the window the minute he got together with that woman. Good co-parenting is not just being a good dad to your son. How is he doing that now? Being a good dad is being a caretaker, a provider, a safe place and loving person, a protector. So far, I can\u2019t use any of those terms to describe your ex based on your post.", "NTA. Your ex doesn\u2019t want to work it out in court because the court will rip him a new one and alter the custody agreement in your favor, most likely. This is a really unsafe environment for your child, you absolutely need to get a lawyer involved and go through the courts. Don\u2019t take your ex\u2019s word for things, he very clearly prioritizes the new wife over his child.", "You need to sit down with a mediator/therapist. Write everything down with dates if possible, then go to court and gain full custody. It\u2019s sad men these days will burn \ud83d\udd25 their relationships with their children for a piece of tail. She\u2019s unstable and your son does not belong there.", "I think you are leaving much of the story out, so I don't know how to judge it.", "YTA for under-reacting.  Why weren't the police called after the 8 year PULLED A KNIFE on your son?  Why didn't you immediately say you'd only let him over if both her and her kids were out of the house?  Stop communicating with her. Only speak with your ex.  Don't go to their house.  Make your ex come pick him up and drop him off so you don't risk further false police reports.  That's only if he agrees neither his wife nor her kids will be there while your son is.  She seems on the path to try and make your ex cut off your son.  Point this out.", "NTA because that sounds like a volatile environment, but you should have gone to court when the knife was pulled. It\u2019s always harder to go back and say the situation is dangerous and then have to admit that the only overt evidence of physical threat wasn\u2019t reported and you still sent him back. It makes it look like you weren\u2019t actually afraid for him because you waited until much later to take action while still sending him over. So go now, talk to an attorney and file for a modification of the custody agreement.", "NTA\n\nYour first job as a parent is to keep your kid safe. He's not safe with her.\n\nPity your ex doesn't understand that.", "But the father has options : divorce her and put his son first.\n\nNTA op but get a protection order against her and her son.", "This is something his dad and I decided together. I made my concerns known to his dad that his wife only has negative things to say about our child, and that our child is scared of her(she flies off the handle when she gets mad) so I let him know I don\u2019t really feel comfortable him being around her at this point. He accepted that and this is how it is now he didn\u2019t really fight me on it. I stated we could go to court but he wants us to figure it out outside of court. (I do have full sole custody of him) through the court and he has visitation rights to every other weekend.", "Not neccessarily up to her depending on legal and physical custody arrangements unfortunately :\\["]}
