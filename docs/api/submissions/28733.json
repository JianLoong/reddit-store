I also watched some YouTube videos about men getting screwed in divorced and got scared. She was extremely angry and thought I was trying to take advantage of her.

Not a huge amount essentially a million dollar house (which is only a 3 bed 2 bath but in an expensive city). \n\nWe argued for like 6 months and I agreed to drop the prenup conversation. The reason I did was because her salary is very high and she is very hard working. She is also very well educated with a masters and her family so fairly well of too. So I just don\u2019t think she would try actually to steal my money. She also is very prideful and after talking to her it seems she hates the idea of agreeing sign a prenup being more of a pride thing. I also accidentally told her my parents wanted it which hurt their relationship. I got a lot of crap from my dad who had his money stolen by his first wife and argued with him a lot about it.

Then my fianc\u00e9 hands me the prenup and tells me to get lawyer who specializes in it to read through and sign it. The prenup had most of what I wanted but some of what she wanted and it was fair at first glance. I was surprised because she was very against the prenup and now she is ok with it? I argued with my parents over it for her and it damaged our relationship. \n\nI got angry and called her manipulative and she shot back she wasn\u2019t ok with it initially and it took months of therapy for her to realize why she wasn\u2019t ok with it. She said she felt like I should be ok with proposing to her with full trust she wouldn\u2019t screw me over. But now that I\u2019ve done that she is ok giving me the prenup I want. I yelled at her that she was manipulative and should have told me earlier and she argued I wanted a prenup because I watched sexist men on YouTube and listen to my parents over her so she needed to see if I would take her side. I\u2019m still pissed but technically she agreed to the prenup. We have enough time to review and sign it but I\u2019m just angry at the way she agreed to it. Like she planned this move to test me.

You never thought about prenups in your adult life. It was a non-issue. Something your parents mentioned once or twice but you didn\u2019t really care. And then you watched a few videos on YouTube, a famously balanced and well-reasoned source of information (/s), and suddenly told your fianc\u00e9e that you wanted one.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e spent upwards of 6 months arguing about it with you, considering her options, talking to her therapist, considering your terms, coming up with her terms. She may have even researched. She may have even watched YouTube! And she determined over the course of that long period of time that her knee jerk reaction was short sighted and that you were right.\n\nAnd you think HER decision was too sudden? You, who put approximately the same amount of thought into it as a kid watching a toy commercial? You who didn\u2019t care about a prenup until you watched some biased videos?\n\nDoes she need to make you a slideshow outlining her months of thought? Does she need to time travel back to that first conversation and agree immediately? What exactly do you want from her to prove that her changing her mind was genuine and not manipulative?\n\nYTA. Because you watched the toy commercial, bickered for 6 months about how you HAD TO get the shiny new toy immediately, finally got it through your head that whining and arguing doesn\u2019t earn you any toys, woke up Christmas morning, opened your present, saw the shiny new toy you\u2019d been wanting all year, and threw a tantrum because you got it today instead of 6 months ago and nobody warned you.", "YTA. My God you're exhausting. I mean, seriously. . . she agreed to the prenup and now you're upset that she agreed to it??? You sound impossible to please and I wish her all the luck in the world; I think she'll need it.", "Lol YTA. you think men get their \u201cmoney stolen\u201d by women when they didn\u2019t get prenups and the law says they are entitled to certain money? You\u2019re big brat and I\u2019m glad she told you what\u2019s up. Stay off of YouTube for life advice. And you are the one who decided to involve your folks in your relationship. Good for her.", "YTA its fair to ask her about why but her literal response was that she spent hours with a professional exploring why your request initially bothered her and made her upset and realized that she had an irrational response. It's not like she was saying no to \"test\" you.\n\nYour relationship is not the relationship angry men on youtube had, people who got a prenuptial agreement or didn't and had things work well don't often decide to post about such topics. She's right in a sense that you aren't pulling from great sources.\n\nAs for your parents, I get people asking parents for advice, but your parents have no actual place in your relationship. She is marrying you, not them. You are your own person and a grown adult, your parents need to respect YOUR decisions even if they aren't in line with what they think is best.", "ESH. You deserve each other. You were the AH in the first instance for letting Youtube and Your Parents convince you into suggesting a prenup and now she's returned the favor.\n\nYou both are showing red flags in this relationship.", "YTA heavily. Don't get married your parents and her will never get along now rightfully.\n\nGotta add I hope you signed up for all the bullshit classes and shit the redpill youtubers advertise. Spend all your money on daddy Tate and the like.", "YTA", "Fucking bravo to your lady- you played you\u2019re self Playa. \n\nWhat are you bitching about - you got what you asked for?", "ESH...\n\nI mean she isn't wrong about u wanting to sign a prenup because of sexist men on yt and what your parents said. I guess she also isn't really wrong about wanting to see if you'll trust her, but she went about this the wrong way. All she had to do was tell you. \n\nYou can either break it off with her or let this go and sign the prenup. I also can't say she ruined your relationship with your parents as your parents did that. It wasn't any of your parents business if you signed a prenup or not. \n\nYour dad had no right to give you crap and argue over your marriage. This is between you and your \nFianc\u00e9 not your parents.\n\nEdit: research prenups and what not properly. Don't get opinions and experiences from yt or your dad.", "ESH\n\nY'all better have a prenup because y'all are already bitter and angry at each other. The divorce will be epic.\n\n(You are the AH because you let YT convince you women were all out to get you. She's the AH for springing this on you without warning or conversation.)", "Don\u2019t get married.", "YTA - You got what you wanted, and you are still unhappy? Is this because she brought it up? Maybe you two should postpone the wedding.", "YTA. You should never have been listening to toxic dude bros on YouTube OR taking your parents\u2019 side over hers. She was right to make you set boundaries with them before coming to the prenup on her own terms. Your initial idea for a prenup was also probably heavily unbalanced to favor you.", "Esh, you are selfish. You talk about i want to protect myself just incase she gets petty. You should want you both to be protected. This is the person you love and want to marry yet you only thought of yourself.\n\nShe didn\u2019t go about it the right way. But i cant fully blame having the reaction she did.", "A wedding that will last!", "\"At first glance\" what does that mean? Is there something hidden in there that only someone with an Ovaltine decoder ring will be able to figure out?\n\nYour marriage is already on the wrong foot, either fix the relationship or don't get married. You weren't wrong for wanting a prenup, and she wasn't wrong for being offended. However, you both are wrong for still talking about getting married when you have this discourse hanging over your heads.\n\nESH.", "NTA - After reading all of that, *definitely* get a prenup.", "EAH.\n\n\n You got the prenup.  Why the hell would you go and be upset that she finally agreed to it?  If you didn't want her to agree to a prenup, then why bring up the prenup at all? She's being over dramatic about the prenup causing her mental anguish and you're being overly dramatic about it damaging your relationship with your parents.  Prenups exist for a reason.  You could argue it's the ultimate test of love.  When there is a prenup, you remove the material part out of the marriage.  At that point there is only one reason to get married: love.", "You told her you want a pre nap,  She did not want one and you argued.\n\nYou agreed to drop the demand, \n\nOut of the bud she hands you a prenup and says that you need to sign it.  You called it.  it is manipulative.  It is a red flag,IMO.\n\nShe needed to communicate with you that she had changed her mind, and she did not.\n\nNTA", "Don't you mean your future ex-wife?\n\nESH. You're 31 and still letting your parents tell you what to do? Because your dad has a grudge from some past relationship because he had a shit lawyer? Her for staying with you.", "NTA - For it to be manipulative it needs to be done with intent.  There is not enough info to know if she did this purposefully to spite you.  \n\nHere is the platform for you to stand on when you (and anyone else reading this) wants a pre-nup:\n\n*She said she felt like I should be ok with proposing to her with full trust she wouldn\u2019t screw me over.*\n\nA pre-nup is NOT about trust.  I'm going to repeat that so it sinks in.  A PRE-NUP IS NOT ABOUT TRUST.  It is a numbers game and is there to protect the parties involved.  Anything, and I mean ANYTHING can happen between now and then and the pre-nup protects the parteis involved.  That's it.  No excuses.  No ulterior motives.  No manipulation.  No \"screwing\" the other person over.  It's just to cover your ass from the unknown.", "NTA - It\u2019s a bit strange and emotionally immature to put in tests like that. If you two don\u2019t fully trust each other, what are you even doing getting married in 2 months? Having a prenup is smart, it\u2019s just a preventive measure in case things go south. If your marriage works out, that piece of paper (prenup) essentially would just stay there useless, collecting dust. Her perceiving that as you not trusting her was strange. But she could have this conversation openly with you, instead of playing games. Any secure person would voice their concern openly, instead of creating chaos like this. This is a red flag, OP. Give it some serious thought and see if this is a recurring pattern. Someone who plays mind games like this is most likely not gonna show up as a reliable partner in a fulfilling marriage.", "I just think it\u2019s strange that so close to the wedding date she just springs this on him. I get the reason for OP wanting a prenup, even if it stings a bit to be the fianc\u00e9e. But why, during all the time elapsed between the initial discussion(s) and the abrupt change of heart was there not an ongoing conversation? I would expect some back and forth about feelings and expectations and compromises. This is not mature behavior for an adult couple about to be married.", "ESH\n\nYou suck 2/5 AH points for being kinda spineless and insecure in terms of your initial reasoning for the prenup and definitely for the childish reaction to the second pre-nup\n\n1/5 AH to her for the testing-your-loyalty part of it, although the rest of her reasoning is much more adult-like and acceptable than yours.", "All of you are AHs.\n\nYour dad passed on his fear/rage at his first wife of financially screwing him over onto you. You watched only one side of divorces involving money being taken, allowed yourself to be scared, & let your fear take the wheel (your concerns are genuine; most people are jerks). It does sound like your fiancee played you intentionally as a test to see where your loyalties lie. She is giving you the prenup you want...after you've wrecked your relationship with your parents over it.\n\nYou're both full of red flags.", "ESH. Ugh. You two need therapy before you\u2019re even married. \n\nAlso, check your local laws because in many places inherited assets are NOT considered joint assets. You may be misinformed about your LOCAL laws if you\u2019re getting your legal advice from YouTube.", "Have your parents leave you the house in the form of a trust. I\u2019m not a lawyer but did put my condo in a trust. And yes, ESH here.", "If she's arguing so vehemently against a prenup, that's a huge sign that you really really really should have one. Just because she has her own money, doesn't mean she wouldn't come after yours in the event that the marriage does fall apart in the future. Many reasons : she loses her money ; greed ; spite...\n\nAnd though some guys might not believe this, some of us ladies actually *want* a prenup. We have savings of our own to protect, homes, inheritances, whatever. And we don't want to be accused of being gold diggers if hubby happens to earn 1% higher salary...", "Don't marry her. Really, just don't. She sprang the prenup on you, after all the plans were made, she thinks she's got you against the wall. She's controlling and deceitful. Don't marry her. You're NTA, now don't be a schmuck.", "NTA! You\u2019re heading to Italy, but thankfully she showed those marinara flags early! \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nShe lied to you and manipulated your view of your own thoughts and your relationship with your parents as some devious loyalty test. She sees nothing wrong with this, she\u2019s not sorry, and she will keep doing it. You should never trust someone who will trick you and hurt you to prove a point. She will twist and distort everything for this entire marriage, if you are foolish enough to go through with it.", "NTA. She was manipulative. She tested you to see if you would side with her. That is manipulative! Whether her intentions were good or not doesn\u2019t negate her actions. Honestly this is a big red flag for me. In your marriage will there be further \u201ctests\u201d from her? You both need to work on communication or this marriage is doomed. In addition, her pulling this right before the wedding is more manipulations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
