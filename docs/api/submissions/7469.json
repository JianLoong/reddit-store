{"id": 7469, "submission_id": "10dc3uj", "title": "AITA for not paying my daughter to babysit her younger siblings?", "selftext": "So my 20 year old daughter is currently a college student. She lives in my house free of rent. I only ask her to do a few things around the house from time to time, like cooking and cleaning. Typical things you're expected to do on a daily basis anyways. Occasionally she has to watch over her younger brothers since I may be busy with work or when I need a break to hang out with my girlfriend. \n\nMy daughter recently spoke up to me about how she feels I'm putting too much of a workload on her back which I don't see how. She told me she's okay with cooking and cleaning around the house, but having to watch over her siblings was annoying & stressful and that it's taking away from her studies. That pissed me off because I myself went to school while having to pay bills & take care of her as a baby alongside my ex-wife. I told her she was acting very privileged and that if I could do it, so could she. She didn't like that very much and stormed off into her room. \n\nWell she went behind my back and told my sister about how \"bad\" I was treating her. My sister is very kind & gullible at times, so she called me and said the least I could do was give her an allowance for the chores I make her do. I explained why I felt that wasn't necessary and she told me not to compare my situation to my Daughter's since apparently I put myself in the position I was in back then which I guess is a fair argument. But since she is living in my house rent free and I'm paying for her college, I feel that in of itself should count as an allowance. So I just wanted to ask whether I'm wrong for not wanting to pay her extra money to do basic chores.\n\nEdit: So in regards to how often I ask her to babysit, it's usually 3 times a week. I don't see how that's too much to ask of her. It's usually only for a few hours until I get back home. My boys are twins & they're 5 years old. They aren't crazy kids by the way, they're more mature than the typical one's you'll see.", "created_utc": 1673868091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dc3uj/aita_for_not_paying_my_daughter_to_babysit_her/", "score": 6331, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also: do you expect her to drop any plans she already has, or do you get someone else if your daughter already has plans?\n\nIt's not unreasonable to ask her to help out, but she also has her own life and plans and she shouldn't always be expected to drop her plans to do something fun just so you can do something fun instead.", "You're not the asshole for not giving her an allowance. She is living rent free, after all. You are the asshole for your diatribe about how if you can go to school, pay bills, and take care of a family, she should also be able to. What may have been easy for you, may not be for her. People have different stress thresholds. If she's telling you that babysitting is too stressful on top of school and chores, I think you should listen. And it's not like she's complaining about chores and doesn't want to do anything around the house. She's simply telling you that adding babysitting onto her chores is overwhelming for her, which it may very well be. Also, her siblings are your kids, not hers, so they're also your responsibility.", "YTA\n\n\"because I myself went to school while having to pay bills & take care of her as a baby alongside\"  \n\n\nThat was your own baby and your own decision, same as now.

Your daughter is not you, just because you did it doesn't mean she can too, not should she have to, she didn't have these kids. Also, babysitting is not a \"basic chore\". It's not something you can put off until you're ready to do it, it's much more stressful than doing the dishes.", "French student here. For me, YTA, but i would admit it's probably a cultural difference. It would never be acceptable for my parents to make me pay the fact that i'm staying at their house during college by doing a lot of chores and by watching my siblings.

Thats not about your experiences or what you can handle. This is about her and for you to be so dismissive is prime AH behaviour. Its nothing to do with her being privileged. We all have different tolerances and that should be respected. If she feels its affecting her studies then that should be taken seriously", "YTA. Our children should have better lives than we did, your struggle should have nothing to do with how you treat her.", "YTA. Chores are fine. Babysitting regularly is another matter. You had to take care of your daughter when you were in school because YOU made a baby. She can help out in a pinch, but you need regular paid care for the younger brothers.

Just because YOU struggled, doesn't mean other people should. And you should also know how difficult it is. She is not a parent, and should not be treated as the 'mother' in the house. She's your child and if she says that she is finding it difficult to juggle everything, you are the parent, you need to suck it up! Or at the very least offer her something in return. What would you do if she moved out? You'd have to hire someone. Just because she is in the house, doesn't mean you can just expect her to do stuff for you in her time, especially when she has highlighted that she is struggling with studies. If she's already contributing to the household by doing a share of the cleaning, then she is doing enough.\n\nAlso, this notion of living in your parents house 'rent free' is madness. You and your ex birthed this girl, to use that she lives there 'rent free' as an argument against her is really shitty.

She lives in my house free of rent. I only ask her to do a few things around the house from time to time, like cooking and cleaning. Typical things you're expected to do on a daily basis anyways. Occasionally she has to watch over her younger brothers since I may be busy with work or when I need a break to hang out with my girlfriend. \n\nMy daughter recently spoke up to me about how she feels I'm putting too much of a workload on her back which I don't see how. She told me she's okay with cooking and cleaning around the house, but having to watch over her siblings was annoying & stressful and that it's taking away from her studies. That pissed me off because I myself went to school while having to pay bills & take care of her as a baby alongside my ex-wife. I told her she was acting very privileged and that if I could do it, so could she. She didn't like that very much and stormed off into her room. \n\nWell she went behind my back and told my sister about how \"bad\" I was treating her. My sister is very kind & gullible at times, so she called me and said the least I could do was give her an allowance for the chores I make her do. I explained why I felt that wasn't necessary and she told me not to compare my situation to my Daughter's since apparently I put myself in the position I was in back then which I guess is a fair argument. But since she is living in my house rent free and I'm paying for her college, I feel that in of itself should count as an allowance. So I just wanted to ask whether I'm wrong for not wanting to pay her extra money to do basic chores.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Same for watching her siblings, I would say cleaning at the equivalent of the whole house once a month is reasonable (functionally a room each week, if you have a kitchen/living room/bathroom/basement you are asking her to clean). If she is cooking every other meal, then that is the equivalent of her paying for the food she is eating. If she is watching her brothers 2-3 days a week for 4+ hours at a time, that is above what \"reasonable chores\" would entail.

If my brother decided to permanently move in with me and racked up a bunch of bills, at some point I am going to ask him to help out because I\u2019m not rich and can\u2019t support extra people indefinitely.", ">There\u2019s more for us to learn.\n\nYep. Profs I've had have said the same thing. \"If I was going through this same degree in today's age it would be much harder\". Because the information we have on any given subject is exploding exponentially every single day. We have so much more info to absorb now but degrees are still only 4 years long on average. The information density is what makes it hard. \n\nPlus the fact that with hyperconnectivity intruding into our lives more and more with time, the demand for our attention has skyrocketed and ability to focus has sharply declined. The technical term is \"continuous partial attention\" and it's been a phenomenon since the late 90s, but has progressed significantly in recent years, especially among millennials and zoomers. It's unfair to say that the responsibility and blame rest entirely on the individual to block out all distractions. Nowadays, colleges expect students to download apps that will notify students of changing course info, new locations for lectures and labs, reminders, messages, and everything else. Lots of lectures involve doing polls and quizzes from your phone. Add on to the fact that social interaction and networking plays a massive part of the college experience, and disabling social media is an unrealistic expectation. In fact the social damage caused by blocking out social media would be arguably worse than the effects of its distraction. But the fact that we have to manage that additional layer of responsibility, while carrying around devices that constantly scream for our attention, is something that previous generations of students didn't have to manage. It was so much easier to separate work from play, and valuable info from noise.\n\nAnd finally the flexibility of degrees has also changed dramatically. When my mom's generation was in school, most families were not sending their children off to college. So the predominant societal model was to enter the workforce and begin your \"adult life\" directly after high school. Colleges offered a lot more \"work while you study\" type of arrangements, like night classes and prolonged degrees (i.e. programs explicitly designed to allow you to juggle your college workload with raising a young family). Nowadays, post secondary education is basically non-optional, so the predominant societal model is that you continue to live off your parents into your 20s, and continue to be a full-time student for at least 4 years after high school. Because of this, the flexibility of degree programs has shifted. Yes there are still online/night classes, but the quality of education will not measure up to that which is obtained from being a full-time student. The most in-demand degrees are taught during daytime hours and have very little flexibility for alternative arrangements. And now more than ever, it DOES matter that your degree is in-demand, because a couple generations ago, having ANY degree was what made you stand out in the workforce. Now that so many people have degrees, it's the SPECIFICS of the degree that matter most. If you don't fully commit to the strict requirements of the \"right\" program for your field, then it's almost as bad at not having a degree at all. So many young people can't find work after graduation for exactly this reason. So OP expecting their daughter to sacrifice their schooling in this way could severely impact the rest of her life. It's a generational difference that's not very well understood, in my experience. \n\nMy parents didn't understand when I was going through it, and expected me to hold down a full time job and \"just take classes at night\" like they did. Ignoring the fact that my degree was accredited and therefore only offered certain courses during the day, all my project groups operated in the daytime, and lab work had to be done during daytime lab hours. I barely had time to take care of myself let alone try to hold down a job, and the intensity didn't lessen for the entirety of my 5 year program. My parents response was that I should just go to a more flexible school, then. Well, the majority of my peers who went to those schools couldn't find relevant work for nearly 5 years after graduation. Being 5 years behind in your career progression is a LOT.\n\nTimes have changed. And it would be great if older generations would listen instead of insisting they know better.", "Take a gander at his edit.", "This is key. Was it a predetermined agreement? Or did OP pay for college and allow rent free living without explicitly telling her there was a trade off?
