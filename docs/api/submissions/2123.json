He magically reappeared in our hometown a week before we went saying he wanted to be with his mom for however much time he had left. Tickets were nonrefundable so we went on vacation still after he encouraged us to go. We FaceTimed him every day so he could be a part of the trip still\u2026we get back, and after a bit of drama involving a suicide threat to his cousin, I got a weird feeling and called said cousin.\n\nTurns out there was never any cancer. He has a benign nodule in his lung that developed after his exposure to some chemical in Iraq in the 90s that got tested every so often to make sure it didn\u2019t become malignant. Twenty some years later, it still isn\u2019t. It\u2019s basically scar tissue. Mfer wove this web of lies for attention and to fuel his alcoholism (read: get free drinks at bars and special treatment).\n\nHe ended up having to relocate due to the backlash. He got 86ed from every where and pretty much shunned so he couldn\u2019t find work.
