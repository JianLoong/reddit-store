At least you gave him well wishes and hoped he\u2019d get well soon! \n\nI think he gave you an out and if he thinks flirting with a girl you both know has a thing for him, I think it\u2019s pretty clear you\u2019re better off letting him do his own thing in his own space while you go live your best life without him!!", "NTA. That\u2019s borderline cheating. He deserved it.", "nta. maybe you could've approached this more gently, sure, but who in their right mind pretends to be a dying person to get free shit", "NTA.

Tell him you will apologize when he actually goes to a doctor.\n\nI will never understand why men do this.  There is nothing masculine about roughing it out and not following doctors orders.
