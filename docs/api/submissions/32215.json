Her issue is that she finds it \u201cdisgusting\u201d that I keep him at all. Which again is fine, to each their own, but I don\u2019t think I should need to cater to her preference.

Look at it this way, for comparison purposes only, if you have a cat or dog that a family member is allergic to would you take this same stance?  A host needs to take steps to make   certain guests are comfortable.  If you decide to not put your pet outside, you need to be certain all know.

If you don\u2019t like them don\u2019t look at their enclosures. My mom and sister have an insane fear of snakes so when they come to town and visit at my house (they don\u2019t stay with us) I do cover their enclosures with a sheet because I love them but anyone else can just not come if they don\u2019t like them. It\u2019s my snakes\u2019 home, not the guests\u2019.", "I'm terrified of spiders, I lock up and either scream or struggle to breathe. That being said, I would not expect you to move or get rid of your pet. You do have to understand that some people can't handle being around them. Maybe just put something in front of the terrarium so it's not super visual. That's worked on me in the past (although I wasn't aware of it at the time). You are NTA. It's your house and your spider lives there. Good luck with your family.", "NTA. And this is coming from someone who IS afraid of spiders. TBH I wouldn't go a house where a spider is kept as a pet, but I'd never ask for the pet to be removed; it's your house and your beloved pet.", "INFO: could you cover the spider\u2019s cage with a towel so it was completely hidden, or would that stress the spider out?", "NTA\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you won\u2019t be able to attend the housewarming.

I can\u2019t stand when people needlessly test boundaries. First it\u2019s your spider, then it\u2019s feeling entitled to offer up a room at your place anytime relatives come to town. Don\u2019t budge on this.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nEnjoy the peace and quiet.  \n\nYou know \"keeping the peace\" only ever seems to work in the favor of the people who suggest it.\n\nYou're a good pet owner.", "NTA. BUT if it\u2019s not detrimental to the spider, for its own safety, it may be a good idea to move it to a locked room when you have a party. \n\nI know it\u2019s your house, your rules, but it\u2019s common to lock away a skittish cat, or a big boisterous dog, when you have a bunch of guests over. It\u2019s not entirely in the realm of odd, to move any pet away from a lot of weird people.", "Look, like your father said when you were a kid... when you pay the bills for the house you can make the rules. Until then you follow my rules.\n\nWho's paying the bills for this place?", "NTA personally i don't like tarantulas but its stupid to force you to move he if  you had make sure that he won't scape.", "NTA Lots of people with lots of time on their hands to make such a fuss over a spider in a tank, completely out of their way.", "NTA. You can be stubborn. It's YOUR house. If they don't like the way YOUR house is, they can stay in THEIR house. There is not a necessity for them to be there. And easier for 'everyone' ??? Yeah, everyone except you, who is the only person whose comfort matters in YOUR house!", "As someone who is absolutely terrified of spiders NTA. Would it be possible I wouldn\u2019t go to someone\u2019s house if they had a tarantula in the common area, I also wouldn\u2019t ask them to move it nor would I turn family against the person for not moving it. I\u2019d politely decline my invite and go about my life. If the person asked why I declined I\u2019d tell them the spider. They could decide where to go from there", "NTA.\n\nLook, I don't like spiders at all. They freak me TF out. But he's your pet, and it's your/his home. And this isn't a concern over allergies or something else unavoidable. \n\nSo my judgment is the same as it would be if someone didn't like my GSDs and wanted them hidden: tough. \n\nDon't want to see the homeowner's pet? Then don't visit. Easy peasy.", "NTA.\n\nIt just amazes me how some guests expect people to traumatize pets for their convenience. \n\nEven if OP\u2019s guest is phobic, she can decide not to come or can sit far away from Spidey. \n\nI tell phobic friends I have dogs and cats, and \u201cunderstand if they\u2019re not comfortable hanging at the house, we can meet somewhere else.\u201d \n\nNo, I am not confining my pets or putting them out in hot/cold weather. \n\nIt\u2019s not like the spider is going to crawl on people yelling \u201cI\u2019m going to eat you!\u201d - but I\u2019d pay to see that. \ud83d\ude09", "NTA this is your house and they don't have the right to make demands. They are the ones making this difficult and I wouldn't budge one inch.", "NTA. As you mentioned, it would be different if there was a legit phobia involved, but I think in that case the person couldn't even stand the knowledge of the spider being in the next room. Next thing you know somebody's gonna say one of your pictures on the wall isn't to their liking, and that you should put it elsewhere when they visit. If they can't stand your place the way it is, they have no business being there.", "NTA\n\nIf people want to come see my house, I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s picked up and provide snacks and drinks.  But I\u2019m not hiding my pets.\n\nComing to my house for a housewarming is an entirely optional activity - they can opt out.\n\nI will Tell them I have pets, and what they are - just to make sure they know before they come so they aren\u2019t surprised.  Which is actually something a lot of cat and dog owners Don\u2019t do, and they should.\n\nI\u2019ve got four snakes and a flight cage with two parakeets.\n\nEdit - I Will cover their enclosures and cages if someone who would be freaked out is required to be in my house - like a repair tech.  It\u2019s funny though - I\u2019ve only had to do it for one guy who was terrified of birds.  The snakes, the various people were mostly fascinated and asked me a bunch of questions, or just asked me if they were locked in and couldn\u2019t get out while they worked.", "NTA\nIt is just a spider...  So she can either suck it up or stay away. I guess no house party where you have to entertain ungrateful entitled people, will be incredibly difficult for you to get over but I'm  sure you will eventually come to terms with it!", "NTA. Isn't it great to have your own place? *You* get to decide what you're willing to do and what you're not willing to do.\n\nAs you say, it's barely visible, so it should not be a problem. In the long term, everyone who wants to see your place will eventually get the chance to visit. It doesn't take a big party to make that happen.", "I totally understand both sides but I have family members who are so afraid of spiders they cannot move when they see one so I'd tend to side with your other family member...? How stressful is it for the spider to move it?", "Personally I\u2019d rather see (from a bit of a distance) that he is still in the tank and has not escaped it and is roaming the home freely. However I would definitely station myself on the opposite side of the room from him.", "NTA\n\nThey knew what they were getting into. This is *your* home. If they want to come over that badly, the door is still open like you said. They'll get over it. Now you just have more time to enjoy the peace and quiet of your space.", "NTA. Your house, your pet, your rules.", "Aaaannnnddd... now that's in my head.", "NTA at all. I had to compose myself from laughing at the situation...have a housewarming party, but you need to make adjustments to your house or we are not coming. You are in no way obligated to adjust your home, that you pay for, for a party. She can ask, you have the right to say no. Enjoy your new home (congratulations) and solitude.", "While it wouldn\u2019t be detrimental, I prefer not to cause unnecessary stress. IMO, moving an entire terrarium is a lot different than moving a dog/cat to another room. The only danger people pose is when he\u2019s out which he would not be.", "I think for its own safety it would be much safer staying put? As OP mentioned moving them is stressful and they\u2019re fragile. Moving pets that are not housed in tanks like a dog or cat is different than moving an entire enclosure.", "So, your family would avoid the house then.  That\u2019s fine, there\u2019s no need to set foot in it.  And avoiding known phobia triggers is a good idea unless you\u2019re working on it with a therapist.\n\nAnd missing a casual housewarming is hardly a big deal.  They could keep in touch with OP a dozen ways, and meet her anywhere else on the planet any time.  \n\nHeck, if they\u2019d feel left out without being there for a tour and the family gossip, they can facetime anyone there during the housewarming.", "They\u2019re very sensitive to vibrations and very fragile, it\u2019s hard to say how stressful exactly. I think the main detail to add is that it isn\u2019t a phobia or fear, she just thinks he\u2019s gross.", "She doesn\u2019t have a phobia.. she just thinks it\u2019s gross.", "The commenter I was replying to has phobic family."]}
