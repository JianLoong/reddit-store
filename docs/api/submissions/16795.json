Definitely NTA", "Your sister is a piece of work honestly", "Understood, but my point is none of those info would have altered this particular judgment.  Unless you're saying there is...", "gotta use the whole phrase, though; \"clonal polyps\" is what makes \"coral reef of narcissism\" work", "Honestly, this seems like the only explanation. She chose the local leader of the cult (and owner of the cult's property) to be her mom and is fine with the other children of the cult being there.", "No, I agree with you. It's just that OP seems to have no idea what the problem is, and that's the bit that's hard to believe.\n\nSome people though refuse to believe that people that they trust are racist, and I think people are fishing to see if OP falls into that category.", "What stands out to me in particular is that she wasn't even honest with OP initially. She *lied* and told her that the wedding was child-free. Did she not expect OP to be confused as to why there were children there?", "It doesn't sound like the wedding was child-free tbh. I took it as sister lied to OP about that.", "People on this sub like to jump to all sorts of conclusions.", "The two questions are, did mother go to wedding, and does rest of family talk to mother still.", "Seems like every family has one neurotic, angry sister", "NTA!\n\nI don't know who these family members are, but I get the feeling your sis is either the golden child for them or they have just accepted that she is the queen bee and parrot whatever she tells them to think.\n\nI can't say that your sister gets on well with you. She's uncaring, unkind, and completely and cruelly dismissive of you and your family. I'm surprised she let your husband attend. I'm surprised she even noticed that you left (must have felt the loss of people admiring her amazingness).\n\nThis is not a case of a person making one stupid gaff, so you can be hurt but should eventually forgive them. This is a person who - from the start and for over a year - intentionally and with malice of forethought made clear to you that she denies your own flesh as being any kin of hers. She meant it; it wasn't a mistake; and she stands by her actions. That's not something you just overlook and accept.\n\nSo who are all these babies that are her family before her own niece? You know what? Who cares! She can have them. Enjoy your new baby and take care of you and your family of 3. I don't think you need to give that person another thought; and I don't think you are going to miss her one bit.\n\n(And if she ever comes around you wanting something and saying, \"...but, FAAAMILY\" - you can tell her to go check with whoever those wedding guests with their kids were.)", "NTA\n\nYour sister\u2019s response is a joke. Not personal? If she doesn\u2019t consider your child family then that\u2019s very personal. If your family bugs you about it any more, just say that the real issue is that your sister does not consider your child to be her family. You can\u2019t fix that. They can\u2019t defend it.", "F her, cut ties with toxic people like this... Safe for your family & your mental health", "Nta. Your baby is more important than your sister. Always choose your baby.", "NTA. WTF is wrong with your sister? How is your baby not family? If that's how she feels, I would go NC.", "NTA. I've learned over the years that our birth families don't have to be the most important family in our lives. Many times, it is our close friends, our \"chosen\" family, who are the one that would do anything for us. It's been a hard lesson but I'm glad to now be OK with that.\nI'm sorry she treated you that way. I thi k it was pretty shitty.", "NTA I would have grabbed my gift from the gift table and made a scene.", "NTA while I can understand her not wanting a young baby at the wedding, the way she lied to you and allowed others there was really terrible.", "[removed]", "NTA I\u2019m sorry you had such a challenging and scary birth experience compounded by no support from your sibling. \nBe proud of yourself for leaving the wedding when you did, it show strength of character and prioritization of your daughter. You\u2019ll be able to recount this story to your daughter when she is older as \u201cMommy and Daddy left the wedding early because we missed you so much and wanted to be with you as soon as possible\u201d. \n\nEnjoy your baby OP. Congratulations!", "NTA. You are under no obligation to accept your sister's disrespect, but you and your husband do have an obligation to stand up for your child and defend them. You did just that. \n\nOP, I am very sorry you had a difficult pregnancy and birth, I went through something very similar. I hope you are doing well emotionally and physically and have the support you need during this time.", "If your child isn't your sister's family, then clearly you aren't either, so she shouldn't have been the least bit bothered by your leaving.\n\nNTA, and you deserve better people in your life.", "Your pregnancy took her wedding spotlight", "I personally wouldn't have left the wedding, but I think you're definitely NTA for leaving. It makes me wonder how she actually thinks of you. And she waited 2 whole weeks to ask you why you left...? Something's weird with that time frame.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour daughter is still family to your sister, and the fact that she doesn't think that too is concerning.", "NTA.... She is saying your not family. Yikes", "I think there's more going on here, behind the behaviour of all parties involved, than we have privy to, and it's a bit of witch hunt to turn the sister into the baddie. To what end? To make the OP feel better about herself?  We can't give you the real insight into reasons why your sister behaved like this. If you're actually concerned about her, go talk to her, rather than seeking validation for not being an asshole, from a bunch of strangers. You talk of feeling that your sister has neglected to give you the care and attention you feel you deserve, but have you also reciprocated? Might there be things going on in her life? Something has to have gone on for her to ask her land lady to replace her/your mother at the wedding. Brushing it off as 'she's just clearly crazy' is convenient. You talk of being hurt that you were deceived about children/babies being allowed at her wedding, but there's clearly a reason why she feels hurt about yours being there. Why is your hurt valid, but hers not?", "Your sister said that other babies are family but your child, and by extension, you, are not family. Why? Seems like there is some information missing.", "NTA.  send her  23 and me kit for her birthday so she understands your daughter is her relative.\n\nWow, she's  an asshole.  Don't waste  your time driving to see her.\nYour friends are right.", "Who TF sends wedding invites to babies?\n\nNTA", "NTA, if her niece is not family, neither are you", "It\u2019s also wild that her sister would have beef with a 4 month old. Even in the case that OP\u2019s sister is extremely estranged from her blood family and only invited OP to the wedding out of formality; it\u2019s incredibly odd to exclude a 4 month old because \u201cthey\u2019re not my family\u201d. Like OP\u2019s daughter wasn\u2019t the instigator in whatever the Bride\u2019s complex is. \n\nWeirder still. Why would OP\u2019s sister be upset about her leaving the wedding if she holds her blood relatives in such low regard?", "OP, she isn't your child's auntie. She may be an aunt by blood, but she doesn't respect you or your child.\n\n**You gotta stop tearing your heart out for someone who doesn't actually care about you or your kiddo.**", "Chosen family comes from the LGBT community, because of homophobia.", " Nta \n\nI don\u2019t think she likes you.\n\nShe didn\u2019t check on you when you almost died\nShe didn\u2019t congratulate you on having a baby\nShe didn\u2019t visit to see the baby\nShe doesn\u2019t think her niece is her family!!! (Who else is close enough to be family?)", "Damn this one hits me in the black sheep of the family feels. NTA. You aren\u2019t family to her so you shouldn\u2019t be expected to act like she is to you", "My mom called me the DAY BEFORE she got remarried and told me she didn't tell me in advance as it was just for immediate family, but she wanted me to know. I live 2,700 miles away so that was that. This was the nail in the coffin (so many other issues). We didn't speak for 10 years. I only started talking to her again as my younger brother died unexpectedly. She still toxic but I try to maintain boundaries. I don't regret the decision to cut her off. You don't need caustic family members in your life. Set boundaries and live your best life.", "NTA \n\nCongratulations on celebrating your daughter\u2019s first birthday. \n\nAt this point I don\u2019t think it matters what the reason was - your sister was being an AH to not allow you to bring your daughter/her biological niece to the wedding. \n\nI\u2019d accept the gift of silence and distance from your sister.  As others have said you will likely hear from her when she needs something. Ex when she gets pregnant and wants all your baby stuff.", "NTA.\n\nFor all the family taking her side - you've got your NC/Block list and just made gift shopping that much easier.\n\nPS - congrats on your little one!", "NTA. It is very much personal that your daughter- her niece was not invited to the wedding. She doesn't consider her biological niece 'her family'?  Why do you even bother with this person?  If I were you I would go NC and she doesn't have to worry about me or my kid being 'her family'. Sometimes when I read some of these posts it's really hard to believe people would say some of this stuff!!", "Your sis thinks other babies are her niece but not your dayghter, by that logic you should have said to you sis \n\nShe dont have right to ask why you and your husband left her wedding.  \n\nNTA", "I think you just hit the nail on why I've always wanted a huge family (not that I'll ever be able to afford one). I grew up with a large extended family (dad was one of 5 and I've got 10 first cousins, many who have kids around my age). I get the chosen family thing, I know my kid's my family will be on the small side since I'm one of two, and my brother doesn't currently have any kids, so I kind of just want that big family so I know my grandkids will get that build in big family one day. I don't want them to *need* a chosen family (you know, unless my descendants turn out to really suck, lol).", "This is so wild and such a leap, but you're RIGHT, it IS the only explanation. Landlady is even a perfect cover story for a cult leader.", "Hey OP, why would you not answer who the other children she felt were her family are?", "This has a ring of truth. Sister may not have even noticed that OP left the wedding. If other people noticed and asked sister later on why OP left, sister may have realized that that didn't reflect well on her and so she took the offensive with OP, making her out to be the AH for leaving.\n\nThis would account for the delay in contacting OP about it, and her only concern being to put blame on OP rather than find out what issue needed to be healed.", "This person may have hit the nail on the head; but don't mistake it for your responsibility. Even if your sister resents you for your relationship with your mother, that's between her and mom and has absolutely nothing to do with you. I jumped in to just make sure you weren't internalizing anything because especially with your sister's behavior, I get the feeling it's easier for you to feel guilty or responsible for things than it is for her. You were NTA, and your sister's complexes and animosity have nothing to do with you. And also take care, I wish you and your precious family unit the best.", "I got cult from this right away at \"but they're family\".\n\nThis landlord stuff is beyond culty.", "Ah right, I missed that comment. It sounds very much like it could be that."]}
