At the time the invited were sent out, my daughter wasn\u2019t born, but she would have been at the time of the wedding, so I called my sister and asked what the rules were in regard to children. She said it was child free. \n\nI made arrangements for someone to have the baby on the day of the wedding, and thought no more of it. \n\nFor some additional context, I was extremely unwell my entire pregnancy, and almost died giving birth. Not once did my sister ask how we were, not even when the baby was born (not even a text to say congratulations). \n\nShe was 4 months old by the time of the wedding and my sister had met her once and that was only because I went down to see her (I live 100 miles away). \n\nWe get to the wedding and turns out it\u2019s not child free. It\u2019s not even baby free. This broke my heart, and I was so angry, so I just left the wedding and went and picked up my child and drove back home. \n\n2 weeks later my sister calls me and asks why my husband and I left, and when I told her, she kicked off saying it wasn\u2019t personal my daughter wasn\u2019t invited, the other babies were invited as they were her family. I just told her that her niece is also her family and hung up. \n\nSome of my family think I\u2019m TA and should have just sucked it up for my sisters wedding but my friends are on my side.", "created_utc": 1683642218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13crhty/aita_for_leaving_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I were you I would keep in as little of contact as possible but before then I may try and rebuild the relationship and I think you should ask why your sister doesn\u2019t not consider your baby family. If we look into this deeper this may not be your sister just being rude and insensitive maybe she feels hurt, she may feel that you don\u2019t see her as family, just a possibility tho.

You might want to talk this out with her and see if it\u2019s worth it to try saving the relationship. If not, given her absolutely awful behavior, it might be best to go no contact.

I feel like before you left, you should have discussed it with her or someone who was in charge of the wedding. You would know your sister better than anyone here and it may be likely that she lied to you out of malice but you should have confirmed this.  \n\n\nIf your sister lied to you purely out of malice, then she is TA and you had every right to leave and that would subsequently make you NTA.", "NAH.

It sounds like there were some misunderstandings and miscommunications leading up to your sister's wedding. It's understandable that you made arrangements to have someone look after your daughter based on the information your sister gave you about the wedding being child-free. It's also understandable that you were upset and angry when you arrived at the wedding to find out that babies were allowed, and your sister hadn't communicated this to you beforehand.\n\nLeaving the wedding without saying anything to your sister or anyone else may have been seen as abrupt or rude, but considering your circumstances, it's also understandable that you didn't feel comfortable staying. It's unfortunate that your sister didn't check in with you during your pregnancy or after your daughter was born, which may have helped prevent this situation from happening.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether or not you feel like you made the right decision in leaving the wedding. It's understandable that some members of your family may see it as a breach of etiquette, but your friends seem to be supportive of your decision. It's possible that you and your sister could have a conversation to clear the air and try to understand each other's perspectives.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
