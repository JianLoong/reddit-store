At the time the invited were sent out, my daughter wasn\u2019t born, but she would have been at the time of the wedding, so I called my sister and asked what the rules were in regard to children. She said it was child free. \n\nI made arrangements for someone to have the baby on the day of the wedding, and thought no more of it. \n\nFor some additional context, I was extremely unwell my entire pregnancy, and almost died giving birth. Not once did my sister ask how we were, not even when the baby was born (not even a text to say congratulations). \n\nShe was 4 months old by the time of the wedding and my sister had met her once and that was only because I went down to see her (I live 100 miles away). \n\nWe get to the wedding and turns out it\u2019s not child free. It\u2019s not even baby free. This broke my heart, and I was so angry, so I just left the wedding and went and picked up my child and drove back home. \n\n2 weeks later my sister calls me and asks why my husband and I left, and when I told her, she kicked off saying it wasn\u2019t personal my daughter wasn\u2019t invited, the other babies were invited as they were her family. I just told her that her niece is also her family and hung up. \n\nSome of my family think I\u2019m TA and should have just sucked it up for my sisters wedding but my friends are on my side.", "created_utc": 1683642218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13crhty/aita_for_leaving_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 652, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well, excuse me, but if that is how she feels about my child, it is a slap to my face and she will no longer be considered my sister at all as to me, she is one of the dead and will mean nothing to me because of this insult she did to my child.  \nIgnore your family's attempt at getting you to recant on that, as she's sorry that you mistook what she said and all that, as they will try to get you to be in contact with your sister.  \nJust tell them if they try, they will be the same place as your sister non contact from you or your husband.", "NTA- if she doesn\u2019t consider your daughter family, that\u2019s all you need to know.", "Wow, if the neice isn't her family, what the hell does that make you?", "Is it possible that your older sister has become passive and detached to the point of outright meanness out of resentment that her little sister has gotten married and had a child before her? \nI know that in some families it can be like that.\n\nEither way, that\u2019s a her problem, not a you problem. \n\nNTA", "This right here. I'd have walked out too. Fuck her and her nonsense.", "In a different thread we joked that NC meant North Carolina so yeah, time to move to North Carolina. \n\nNTA", "Yeah NTA I would have told her to explain that comment. Who does she consider family then, her inlaws niblings?\n\nWhen you said you weren't close... well thats an understatement, your likely to find more warmth in antartica.\n\nI wouldn't bother reaching out, she doesn't consider your child family, so stop referrin to her an Aunty.", "I mean, was the bride talking about her own kids?  That would make it all make sense.", "No", "The latter", "No", "Why would you say nobody is the asshole? The sister is clearly the asshole. She doesn\u2019t even consider her own niece as family!", "You\n\n>- I would say your anger is totally justified-\n\nSame you\n\n >but leaving the wedding is a nuclear move for sure.\n\nNuclear move? I disagree. \nNuclear move is lying to your sister that your wedding is child free and your only explanation is that your niece isn't your family.", "It wasn\u2019t that there were other babies there per say, it was more I was told that I couldn\u2019t bring my daughter because it was child free and then it wasn\u2019t. \n\nHad my sister told me that she didn\u2019t want me to bring my daughter as she didn\u2019t want her there it would have been different. It still would have sucked but at least she\u2019s have been honest", "1", "No", "Probably the babies of her \"chosen family.\" People have kinda run with that concept. I think chosen families are totally valid, but it is far too often being used to drive a wedge which is not its inte t.", "Maybe her step children?", "Coral reef of narcissism might be one of my all time favorite metaphors, bravo sir", "I love this! Awesome!! LOL!!!", "This is brilliant.

Are y'all mixed-race/ethnicity/culture/religion?  \n\nSometimes when a person is making no sense, it's because of some hidden bigotry", "I'm so, so sorry. I can't even imagine how hurtful this must feel. I don't have kids but my older sister does, and I love them as if I'd given birth to them myself. I actually gasped when your sister \"explained\" about your daughter not being invited because \"the other babies are family\".  What a shockingly awful, hateful thing to say.\n\nGiven that you felt that you'd always gotten on well before, I might actually suggest approaching her and asking what could possibly have happened that you're unaware of that would make her feel so unwelcoming towards you and your child. This just seems so odd. Like, she wasn't just indifferent, that was a truly awful thing to say to you, and even more so if you've never had any big fallings-out.", "I have to ask...  is your partner of a different race, thereby making your child mixed race?  I\u2019m getting that vibe from your sister.", "That's so random I would use it!", "I mean, it may not be her that's hiding something. She seems genuinely confused. I wonder if the sister is harboring some resentment that she hasn't been open about with OP?", "It definitely seems like missing reasons. The sister says she doesn\u2019t consider this child family and OP doesn\u2019t ask for clarification? Other family members think OP is somehow the AH? Weddings are normally the time families get updated family photos - but everyone was ok with excluding this one child from any potential photos? None of it makes sense.", "The only thing I can think of is maybe the baby that was there was her sister's baby or her sister's husband's child?", "Because you got pregnant/gave birth in her \"wedding year\". She was afraid you would draw attention from her, that family would want to see your child, etc. She went out of her way to be cruel to you, ignore you and her new niece, lie to you and cause yo inconvenience because she was jealous that a tiny bit of attention might have been diverted from her to you.", "It's the baby mixed race, or \"out of wedlock\" and she's very religious?", "Your sister is extremely jelaous of you, that you became a mother BEFORE her given that she\u2019s older than you. Talk about being pathetic and petty. She feels threatened by you and your little family and wanted to be a mother before you so she could give your parents their FIRST grandchild but you took that away from her. And now she\u2019s acting like your baby doesn\u2019t exist and is no big deal so she doesn\u2019t get reminded of the fact that her parents have a grandchild. She wants to be the center of attention and you getting pregnant before her has hurt her fragile little ego. Go NC for good. And never look back. She is beyond pathetic.", "Could you have a chat to some other family members about it? Might they know something you don't to explain your sister's behaviour? Might one of them be an ally in terms of making sure your daughter does get included in family occasions?", "I can't imagine wanting a sibling who treated me and my baby this way in my life. Remember,  family is who you make it.", "I get that and thought I covered that? She sees them as family because she\u2019s close to them and not her sister or her sister\u2019s baby, \n\nIm sorry you don\u2019t like my opinion but I stand by my statement I see both sides, they are not close so she prioritised babies that she was closer to.\n\nOp you\u2019re not the A but neither is your sister and you shouldn\u2019t make her day about you, I think it would be beneficial to work out why you\u2019re not close and build a relationship rather than expecting your sister to feel a bond to your child that she clearly doesn\u2019t have, surely working on that and spending time together and spending time with your baby will help?", "And then you wouldn\u2019t have gone at all, rather than go and leave early at least she still had her sister at her wedding, then your parents may have got involved and it becomes a huge debate leading up to her special day I can see why she didn\u2019t want that, it\u2019s her wedding day, either way you would have been offended, again I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an a for leaving but she\u2019s not an a because you\u2019re not close if that\u2019s how your relationship has always been maybe it\u2019s time to work on it together? Again I see your point why I get it and I\u2019m saying you\u2019re not the A but I\u2019m still getting hate because I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong either I do see why you\u2019re upset but I also see her viewpoint I really think this can be used as an opportunity to sit together and think why aren\u2019t we close? How did we get this distant and work on building a relationship where you all see each other as families a biological father isn\u2019t deemed as a dad and she\u2019s not going to be deemed as your babies aunt it sounds to me that she\u2019s already made peace with that and that\u2019s what needs fixing. Wouldn\u2019t you want to try to be closer with her so things like this don\u2019t happen in the future?", "Do you know if there are any problems there? \n\nMy reasoning is I\u2019ve read other comments and it was nearly a year from the engagement that you got pregnant. It wasn\u2019t the first time everyone would meet your daughter. There hasn\u2019t been any underlying issues or fights between you both. Not adopted. Not a different race. No with each others exes etc. \n\nIt\u2019s left me wondering if 1 of them has a fertility problem. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s a reach but I\u2019m proper baffled tbh.", "You are right. Only descriptor for it. I love adding new vocabulary to my box of fun sayings.", "NTA. If she refuses to consider your daughter family. It's probably time to stop putting any effort into staying in touch with her.", "As society has moved away from large families, peoples need for large support networks has not changed. As people are more mobile, the need to be surrounded by people who love us and support us has not changed. As people are less willing to deal with toxic behaviors in their circle, the need for large support networks has not changed.\n\nMy maternal grandmother was one of five siblings. My mother was an only child but had 12  cousins. Everyone lived in Philadelphia.\n\nMy parents had my sister and me, and my father's only sister had two sons. We lived in Chicago and they lived in Atlanta. Our little nuclear family was all we had for close family. \n\nNow I am in my 50s, and have cut off my mother for her narcissistic behavior. My father is dead. My sister lives 90 minutes away, one cousin has disappeared, and one cousin has a wife and three children in Connecticut. \n\nThe people that I do things with, that I see weekly or monthly for shared dinners, the woman whose children I take to the playground so she can get a break now and then, aren't related to me by blood. But they are the people who are present in my life to support me. We share holiday meals and activities. We loan each other things as needed. We help each other with problems, drop off food when someone has a baby, petsit, drive to the airport, sit with someone at the hospital....", "If the step-children are babies (of only a few months in age), then where is the biological mother?", "No. We\u2019re all white and we\u2019ve all gotten along really well before this", "Yes, that's so true!", "No, we\u2019re all white", "Oh, and my first thought was the sister might be ultra religious and not ok with an out of wedlock baby... like, your daughter isn't a Stark, just a Snow!", "Yeah the thing that throws me the most off is the sister said the child wasn\u2019t family and OP doesn\u2019t ask her wtf she means! Like, if my sister said that to me I\u2019d call her out immediately. Not just be like \u201coh okay\u201d.", "I think this is it.\n\nNot only was OP pregnant in the lead-up to the wedding, but she was also very unwell and almost died during childbirth. I imagine OP's health was a hot topic of conversation, which diverted attention away from sister's wedding and the parents especially were probably far too worried about OP to be able to give the wedding the kind of attention sister wanted.", "This may be it but doesn\u2019t explain why the bride noticed her sister and husband left and wanted to know why?  Would think Op\u2019s sister would have been happy she left as it would result in no attention going to Op by other family members.\n\nOp, you got along with your sister but weren\u2019t close. \nThe absence of a close relationship may be where the answer to her point of view can be found. Yet you are remarkably lacking in curiosity about your sister\u2019s odd opinions and actions regarding you.  Why is that?\n\nIs your husband a former boyfriend of your sister\u2019s?", "No, baby is neither of those", "Bro I hate to tell you this but sometimes people can just be assholes with no reason. I\u2019ve experienced that more than a few times in my life, where someone didn\u2019t have a reason to dislike me but they did anyways.", "you're giving a lot of leeway to a sister that admitted OP's daughter isn't considered family", "I understand your opinion but telling your sister that your niece isn't family unless there's an actual reason besides we're not that close absolutely makes you an asshole", "**the baby is not her family? then SHE is not your family either... she is TA**", "And my husband and I have been married for 3 years. We had been married for a year when I got pregnant", "I wouldn't be surprised if it's just cause op got pregnant around the time of the engagement. Some people are just like that", "She may not have even noticed, but heard about it from other guests. She may have felt like OP showing up and then walking out caused drama and tarnished her wedding day. She probably already knew or suspected why OP left, but wanted a confrontation in hopes she could scrounge up a reason to lay the fault at OP's feet.", "This isn\u2019t a rando, this is her sister who \u201cchanged as soon as OP told her she was pregnant\u201d. If my sister got weird with me I\u2019d call her out immediately. So OP either doesn\u2019t want to know the issue, or knows and isn\u2019t acknowledging it.", "Yeah I don't know. I read that story and it skews very one sided. I guess I don't believe this particular story.", "Closeness has a huge part of it though, she never said the baby wasn\u2019t family she said the other babies were, it is different, and the op\u2019s first paragraph was they are not close so surely that\u2019s her reasoning with her actions of leaving the wedding which is what she was asking is she the A for leaving her sisters wedding no, is her sister the a for not seeing a baby she never sees as family no.\n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from but again I see both sides, in order for her to see her biological niece as family she\u2019d have to spend time with her to develop a bond, and that\u2019s what the issue is as they are not close. If the baby grows up not knowing their aunt or calling her aunty because they never see her and haven\u2019t built up that family aunt niece/nephew relationship that would be fine right because they are not close they are biologically related not family and that\u2019s a huge difference, neither of them are A\u2019s they just need to prioritise their relationship to be closer and have that family bond.", "Do you have any ideas at all why your sister is acting like this then? It\u2019s very confusing and not at all normal. Why would she not consider her sisters daughter family? She does consider you her sister right? You aren\u2019t like step sisters or something?", "Or y'know...possibly OP has spent most of the last year being ill during her pregnancy and then recovering from nearly dying during the birth - as previously mentioned - and really hasn't had the energy to spare for someone acting weird a hundred miles away from her.", "It may just genuinely be that OP got pregnant around the time of her sister's engagement, and sis just couldn't handle it.", "I\u2019m not adopted, I\u2019ve never dated her husband, my husband and my sister have always gotten on really well. As have my husband and her husband and my and her husband", "Well she has plenty of energy to post on Reddit and respond to strangers. Seems like her priorities are a bit off.", "I didn\u2019t even get pregnant near the time of the engagement, it was about a year later", "Oh man, I read that wrong. My apologies. It still doesn't make sense why she doesn't like your daughter then ."]}
