He is a great guy, with a big heart. He has known Lexi (24F) for about 4 years. They met when Lexi was dating one of his friends, who she was with for about 2 years. They broke up over a year ago because the guy had a serious alcohol issue. Jack, as well as their other friends, took Lexi's side in the breakup and really took her under their wings. Jack, and about 4 of his guy friends, became close with Lexi. They hangout often and check in on each other frequently. \n\nI have never met Lexi's ex, but have hung out with Lexi on multiple occasions when she stops by jacks house, or invites Jack somewhere or vice versa. She is a very kind, smart and beautiful girl. Her and I get along fine, but she really gets along well with the boys, and they all call her \"one of the guys\". I started to become a little uncomfortable with their relationship when one night she called Jack quite late because she was drunk at a bar, and the guy who she was out on a date with was being creepy towards her. He immediately dropped everything to pick her up, and she crashed on his couch that night (which she does frequently apparently). It bothers me that they are so close, and that he texts/ calls her frequently to check in on her. \n\nWell, about 2 months ago Jack was really upset and told me that Lexi was diagnosed with stage 2 lymphoma. It was very random and sudden. She had tons of doctors appointments and is starting chemo next week. She is not close with her family, and was planning on just ubering to and from treatments when the boys all stepped up and offered to drive her. Jack offered to take her to her first one, he said he could tell she was scared even though she was playing it off and since they were closest he wanted to be there. I told him I was not comfortable with their relationship and that driving her and being there with her for this was way to lovey for me. I honestly feel like she wants him to take her because she's in love with him. He got mad, and said I was being selfish and that Lexi needed him. His reaction makes me think maybe I am being mean about it. \n\nAITA?  \n\n\nTLDR: boyfriend wants to take girl bsf to chemo, i think she's in love with him and I do not want him to take her.

Its very reasonable to have those thoughts. But what you DONT do is bottle it up inside and try and guilt the BF not to go.

Put your jealousy aside.", "Oof, YTA. I can see why you'd be insecure, but it's not a good reason. She needs someone at a tough time in her life, and all you can see is your boyfriend paying attention to another woman.

Unless you have real evidence that she's \"after your man\" I think you need to step back and evaluate your insecurity.  Realize that they were friends before he met you and will likely remain friends throughout your relationship.", "YTA. \n\nFrom what you've written here, there seems to be no evidence that she's \"in love\" with your BF.

And I don't understand what's \"lovey\" about driving someone to chemo? I guess you don't have any idea what cancer treatment involves.

You maybe or may not be right, but this isn't the time to address this issue which clearly had been building up.\n\nEven if she was well enough to make any advances towards him while suffering the side effects of chemo, I'd hope you have enough trust in your BF to know he would rebuff them.", "Yeah, gonna have to agree, you're the AH here. \n\nIf you can't handle the friendships your bf had when you met him ... you need to find another bf, for his sake, if nothing else", "YTA.

He is a great guy, with a big heart. He has known Lexi (24F) for about 4 years. They met when Lexi was dating one of his friends, who she was with for about 2 years. They broke up over a year ago because the guy had a serious alcohol issue. Jack, as well as their other friends, took Lexi's side in the breakup and really took her under their wings. Jack, and about 4 of his guy friends, became close with Lexi. They hangout often and check in on each other frequently. \n\nI have never met Lexi's ex, but have hung out with Lexi on multiple occasions when she stops by jacks house, or invites Jack somewhere or vice versa. She is a very kind, smart and beautiful girl. Her and I get along fine, but she really gets along well with the boys, and they all call her \"one of the guys\". I started to become a little uncomfortable with their relationship when one night she called Jack quite late because she was drunk at a bar, and the guy who she was out on a date with was being creepy towards her. He immediately dropped everything to pick her up, and she crashed on his couch that night (which she does frequently apparently). It bothers me that they are so close, and that he texts/ calls her frequently to check in on her. \n\nWell, about 2 months ago Jack was really upset and told me that Lexi was diagnosed with stage 2 lymphoma. It was very random and sudden. She had tons of doctors appointments and is starting chemo next week. She is not close with her family, and was planning on just ubering to and from treatments when the boys all stepped up and offered to drive her. Jack offered to take her to her first one, he said he could tell she was scared even though she was playing it off and since they were closest he wanted to be there. I told him I was not comfortable with their relationship and that driving her and being there with her for this was way to lovey for me. I honestly feel like she wants him to take her because she's in love with him. He got mad, and said I was being selfish and that Lexi needed him. His reaction makes me think maybe I am being mean about it. \n\nAITA?  \n\n\nTLDR: boyfriend wants to take girl bsf to chemo, i think she's in love with him and I do not want him to take her.

I myself would be uncomfortable with a female best friend of my boyfriend's sleeping at his house, but there don't appear to be any real red flags, especially in light of the fact that Lexi has wanted to hang out with OP in an effort to get to know her. OP needs to grow up and get in on being part of her support network. She can also offer to drive her. If she can't do that, then maybe she can help her clean her place or make her meals a couple times a week. Cancer is scary. Lexi doesn't deserve to go through it alone.

She does need support and he\u2019s going to give it to her regardless. I feel like your options are to look deep in your gut and ask if this is just a jealousy thing because she is young and pretty, or is something deeper in your gut telling you something isn\u2019t right. Ask yourself how you will feel if he gets further involved in caring for her if she worsens. How will you handle if he temporarily moves her in to care for her? Can you be supportive of that? Will you feel entirely uncomfortable and resentful? Can you become her friend and join the rotation of rides/support? She could probably use a female friend too. Or do you feel his loyalty to her affects his loyalty to you? I don\u2019t think we can answer that for you.

Jealous, insecure, and generally awful. Your bf and his friends sound like good dudes.

Fuck, dude, that's bad.", "Wow. And I bet if she got sexually assaulted by a creep you wouldn't let your bf go pick her up to keep her safe from, it'd be her fault for being drunk or what she was wearing, right? Right.

You should seek therapy, and I mean that for your own well being.  You will never be happy in a relationship if this is how you are reacting to things, and will likely end up making your partner unhappy.", "You are a jealous and insecure person who needs to stop taking it out on this poor girl. 30 years old is too old to be acting like this.

It will be because you are an insecure, selfish, uncaring person.", "And while her hair comes out in clumps", "To be fair, BF and BFF will develop a really close and lasting bond.  It will be complicated, doesn't make OP any less of the AH.   The thing is BF will need a shoulder to lean on as well if he is supporting someone through chemo so she can either support him or GTFO.", "Agree 100%. Plus, I feel like it's unrealistic to think a conversation like that could be had with the BF where he *wouldn't* reassure his GF that everything is fine, even if he has some inkling of a feeling for his girl best friend. He's not realistically going to tell the GF that because he knows it will not help. All that conversation will do is let BF know she doesn't trust him. In this case, it's much better to talk it out with a friend or therapist to try to figure out how to manage feelings/insecurities through this time.", "People are going to come hard for you, because you're being really weird about this, but I just think it's sad you can't imagine a friendship without some secret, ulterior plot.\n\nGo make a friend, have a sleepover.

Of course, I would drive my friend to treatments, but if my partner was really that uncomfortable with it, then I would have to take their feelings into consideration as well. I'm not saying this girl is trying to steal her man, but she very well could be, and OPs feelings are valid for being uncomfortable with the relationship. I would probably have a different opinion had it not happened to me, but I have had a so-called best girlfriend try to steal my man, so it happens!", "I don't think the real problem here is the \"driving to cancer treatment\"\n\nI think its moreso the friend basically making the BF into *her BF as well.*", "I didn't say \"stay on a date\"\n\nI said \"not crash on *his couch*\" Which she said was *a usual thing to happen*.\n\nAnd I didn't say \"go to chemo alone\". It should be split between the friends, not just one friend always doing it.", "I missed the abuse part. Where is itt?", "Maybe. But I'm coming from a history where my husband actually had an emotional affair with someone he worked with, and I saw it coming. Maybe that's why I'm taking her side, but I totally understand how she feels. It's not always just stuff you make up in your head. I figured I'd get downvotes.", "I don\u2019t really see anything wrong with it. They\u2019re friends", "No. Im a goat", "As a woman with a male best friend, I 100% stand by your comment.

The best thing to do is to remain calm and try to make sure that bf doesn\u2019t feel like op is trying to control his relationships, because that will only drive him further into Lexi\u2019s arms.\n\nMy actual thoughts is that op hasn\u2019t really put forward any compelling evidence that Lexi is threat. She kinda just describes the actions of close friends, if one of my homies was drunk at a bar with a creep, I\u2019d go get him too.\n\nOp\u2019s feelings are valid, her actions are unacceptable. One in spite of reality, the other because of it.", "There are 4 other guys who are doing the same. \n\nBut again put yourself in OP bf shoes.  One of your closest friends just found out they have cancer and they have no way to get to chemo.  Would you seriously be ok with your partner telling you forget about them they can find a different ride. \n\nTo me that shows my partner doesn't really care about me and my relationships out of the one with them.

This isn't the time to be jealousy", "How does \"drive her to chemo\" translate to \"make him my bf\"? In what language does that make sense?", "Lexi could legitimately die here, cancer is cancer. This is not the time to have these concerns. As others have pointed out, there is literally no chance of them hooking up when she's going to chemo. If it was going to happen it would have happened already. All OP is doing is showing her bf how insecure she is and how little trust she has in him. I have a best friend who's a girl and it's quite similar to this friendship. If her boyfriend was acting like OP, I would literally be telling her to think hard about the relationship, even though I have no desire to date my friend ever.", "they're all doing it he's just taking her to the first appointment did you even read", "Aw, thanks!", "So happy it was successful!", "She is 24.

Not sure I really want to trust her at all about this.", "Just because you have no friends that want to spend time with you doesn't mean that someone else's boyfriend is sleeping with his horribly sick friend that's going through chemo.

I expect the same from my partner. I disagree with the position it\u2019s disrespectful. If they\u2019re living together, then i definitely see no issue with a friend sleeping on the couch (with the partner couch staying maybe a bit more odd as there is a 2nd person in the home to help with pickup but honestly even then with a quick text not a huge deal).\nIf that\u2019s your boundary that\u2019s fine. You and your wife live that way. OP clearly feels the same, therefore the way OP and her boyfriend view interpersonal relationships differs too much to last and she needs to end it.
