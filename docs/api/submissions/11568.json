The classes are 1 hour long each, and you go from treadmill, to rower, to weights. There is one lady who comes in with her friends (who I\u2019ll call The Banshee) that are incredibly annoying. I\u2019ll also add that I have social anxiety disorder and am slightly on the spectrum, so loud distractions like that really stress me out. They play music during the class, but I\u2019m actually able to zone out most of the time and just listen in on the coach\u2019s voice or just try to enjoy the music if it\u2019s something I like.\n\nThe Banshee and her friends talk at the beginning of class when the coaches are explaining what the workout is going to be, and The Banshee takes it upon herself to scream every time we are at the end of a block or sing (not well) very loudly to the music. Now, while the talking is annoying and distracting, I deal with it because I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s my place to tell someone when they can speak. But the screaming. Jesus. This woman must have implanted a harpy whistle down her throat. Most of the time I try to ignore it even though I hate it, but today I just couldn\u2019t. \n\nWe were at the end of the block and she did something like, \u201cYEEEEEEEAH! COME OOOOOOOOON! WAHOOO YEAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!\u201d So I just screamed out \u201cJesus Christ! JUST SHUT UP!\u201d The guy on my right said something like \u201cI know right?\u201d And the lady on my left said \u201cIt\u2019s so obnoxious.\u201d\n\nThe Banshee didn\u2019t say anything back but looked really embarrassed the rest of the time and decommissioned her harpy whistle for the rest of the workout.

Sorry, but ESH. I find those people extremely obnoxious too, but the \u2018woo\u2019ing is more or less encouraged by the studios.

I wanted to tell her to pipe down as there was about 12 other people in the room siting quietly.\n\nFinally after what seemed forever she got called in.
