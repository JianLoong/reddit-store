The eldest, Mark (M51), has never had a strong bond with my husband given their age difference, and I have only met him a handful of times over the course of my eight-year marriage.\n\nMy husband's sibling group is quite spread out and everyone has their own lives and families, so a group chat was created. Spouses were also included, so all in all, it is quite a big chat and is honestly not used that frequently aside from major life updates. One of these major life updates was that I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy two weeks ago - I shared a photo in the chat and everyone was so thrilled.\n\nThat being said, my MIL (F72) and one of my SILs (F38) were around yesterday when they happened to mention in passing that Mark was really upset with me. I was totally baffled as to why - I barely know the man! My SIL told me that she had seen him a few days ago, and had asked him something about meeting his new nephew. Apparently Mark had no idea what she was talking about, and it came out that he had left the chat and hadn't seen the news, but he was frustrated that I hadn't taken the time to send him a personal message letting him know of the birth.\n\nI told my SIL that that was unreasonable - I had no idea he had left the chat in the first place, and I wasn't going to message every family member individually after I had just given birth. My SIL said that I could have asked my husband to do it so that Mark was included, but I told her that it wasn't our responsibility to make sure Mark was included when he clearly wasn't fussed enough to stay in the group in the first place. I also said that Mark couldn't be that upset because he hadn't made any effort to phone/text either my husband or I since finding out, but my MIL said that was because he has a \"sensitive personality\" and would be feeling very isolated from our family right now.\n\nMy MIL was very upset that I wasn't being understanding as to why Mark was feeling left out, and generally unimportant to my husband and I. She said that she never could have anticipated the birth of a grandchild could tear her family apart like this, and that I am forcing her to choose between her baby and her grandbaby. I said that I am not forcing her to do anything, but I am not going to chase after a grown man when it was his decision to leave the chat in the first place.\n\nMy husband agrees with me, but has told me that I was too harsh in how I said it to his mom, when all she wants is a cohesive family unit. He said we could just sent Mark a personal message and end of all this (which is true), but I feel like it shouldn't be on us.

It's taken from the film *The Wizard of Oz*. It's when a person doesn't call someone to tell them they're upset with them. Instead they tell other people all about it. They tell people who are known to contact the person who has \"caused offence\" and pressure them to contact the \"injured party\" and make it right.\n\nThese people who apply pressure are called flying moneys. In *The Wizard Of Oz* the witch sends her flying monkeys to bring Dorothy to her. In real life people like your BIL will use flying monkeys, your MIL, to get other people, in this case you, to come to them. In this situation you'd be going out of your way while post-partum to contact him and start a conversation about an issue you've heard he's upset about.\n\nThis tactic is used by narcissists, abusers, emotionally immature people, and people who like being the centre of attention and manipulative people. Your MIL is a very good flying monkey. Claiming the birth of your nephew has torn her family apart, because her almost 50 year son left a group chat and doesn't want to text her brother.\n\nIf you want to avoid getting sucked into these petty, energy draining conflicts time and time again, you and your husband need to educate yourself about these dynamics and stop engaging with them. Research terms like grey rock to use on your MIL. Mute MIL messages. Do not message Mark. Maybe throw a message in the group chat, \"@admins MIL wants Mark added back into this chat so that he can view our babies photos\".

You just had a baby and you\u2019re right\u2026marks a grown man who left the group chat. Husband needs to tell him to get back in it and get over himself.", "NTA. Both MIL and Mark sound very dramatic and hard work. To me it is simple, if a person wants to be involved in anything then it's up to that person to be involved and let others know they wish to be involved. Mar left the family group chat this implying he was not interested in family news. If Mark rejoins the group chat he will I'm sure be welcome to do so and he'll find out the news. MIL should stop babying him!", "Don\u2019t forget to add the man\u2019s 51. Why is his mummy talking to you about it?", "Not to mention that it's not even her brother. So I don't get why everyone is upset with her. If they want to be mad at someone they can be upset with her husband. \n\nOp isn't her husband secretary. Especially not after giving birth. \n\nThey want to blame anyone foe not talking to the brother, blame the husband. It's his family not ops.", "I kind of get this. Telling someone you feel hurt by something can feel very intimidating, especially when you have no relationship with them and OP clearly states that he has some problems mentally. It's not a crime to ask someone to talk to someone else for you, when that person has a closer relationship with them. However, his mother comepletely handled this in the wrong way.", "I wondered the same thing!! I\u2019ve been with my husband 30 years and one of our hard and fast rules is that when something happens, good or bad, it\u2019s each person\u2019s responsibility to deal with their respective families. To me it just makes sense! \nI\u2019ve had a relationship with my family forever and know how they are and how they react to things! When it comes to my parents there is an unconditional love that my husband doesn\u2019t share with them. The same is true with him and his family!  So because of that I think it makes more sense for him to deal with his and I deal with mine!\nIf someone was upset by the bil being left out they, really he,  should have contacted your husband! \nThat way there is none of this \u201cyou disrespected my mom\u201d or \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have spoke so harshly to whoever\u201d!
