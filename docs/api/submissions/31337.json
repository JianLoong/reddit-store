Spouses were also included, so all in all, it is quite a big chat and is honestly not used that frequently aside from major life updates. One of these major life updates was that I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy two weeks ago - I shared a photo in the chat and everyone was so thrilled.\n\nThat being said, my MIL (F72) and one of my SILs (F38) were around yesterday when they happened to mention in passing that Mark was really upset with me. I was totally baffled as to why - I barely know the man! My SIL told me that she had seen him a few days ago, and had asked him something about meeting his new nephew. Apparently Mark had no idea what she was talking about, and it came out that he had left the chat and hadn't seen the news, but he was frustrated that I hadn't taken the time to send him a personal message letting him know of the birth.\n\nI told my SIL that that was unreasonable - I had no idea he had left the chat in the first place, and I wasn't going to message every family member individually after I had just given birth. My SIL said that I could have asked my husband to do it so that Mark was included, but I told her that it wasn't our responsibility to make sure Mark was included when he clearly wasn't fussed enough to stay in the group in the first place. I also said that Mark couldn't be that upset because he hadn't made any effort to phone/text either my husband or I since finding out, but my MIL said that was because he has a \"sensitive personality\" and would be feeling very isolated from our family right now.\n\nMy MIL was very upset that I wasn't being understanding as to why Mark was feeling left out, and generally unimportant to my husband and I. She said that she never could have anticipated the birth of a grandchild could tear her family apart like this, and that I am forcing her to choose between her baby and her grandbaby. I said that I am not forcing her to do anything, but I am not going to chase after a grown man when it was his decision to leave the chat in the first place.\n\nMy husband agrees with me, but has told me that I was too harsh in how I said it to his mom, when all she wants is a cohesive family unit. He said we could just sent Mark a personal message and end of all this (which is true), but I feel like it shouldn't be on us.

In *The Wizard Of Oz* the witch sends her flying monkeys to bring Dorothy to her. In real life people like your BIL will use flying monkeys, your MIL, to get other people, in this case you, to come to them. In this situation you'd be going out of your way while post-partum to contact him and start a conversation about an issue you've heard he's upset about.\n\nThis tactic is used by narcissists, abusers, emotionally immature people, and people who like being the centre of attention and manipulative people. Your MIL is a very good flying monkey. Claiming the birth of your nephew has torn her family apart, because her almost 50 year son left a group chat and doesn't want to text her brother.\n\nIf you want to avoid getting sucked into these petty, energy draining conflicts time and time again, you and your husband need to educate yourself about these dynamics and stop engaging with them.

I am a kind, loving and respectful person usually, but I do not cater to people who expect kindness when they do not show any.  I wonder if your family culture hasn't actually damaged Mark's approach to the world.\"", "Gotta love the a 50 year old man not even registering that his own brother didn\u2019t tell him, but instead honing in on this failure of OP\u2019s \u2014 OP who has *just given birth*", "I\u2019d have to disagree on it being the husband responsibility. BIL isn\u2019t entitled to this information. Husband just had a baby, just had a wife pop out a whole person. BIL should be the furthest thing from his mind.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Exactly! We have a familychat. My sister left it because that\u2019s how she is. When we had a baby I texted MY sister. It\u2019s not OPs job to keep track of who knows what in her husbands family. That\u2019s husbands job. MIL can piss off.", "Him leaving the group reeks of \"I want everyone to make me feel like I'm so special that they will be overcome with despair at my absence and will go out of their way to communicate specifically with me,\" only to realize that the world does not, in fact, revolve around him and nobody even noticed his little tantrum.", "This. He should add himself back to the group and move on.\n\nNTA", "Agreed. \n\nCould these people BE any more dramatic. RIP Matthew Perry.", "Doesn't seem like husband is forbidden. If so that changes things.", "I agree, NTA, and Mark seems childish, but I feel like with family you have to think about the long and short game. If it were me, I would have your husband send the following message to Mark, \u201cHi Mark, I heard that you missed our big news when OP posted in the family chat. Well, I\u2019m a daddy, and both mama and baby are doing great! (<<hope this is true, OP) Since we\u2019ll obviously have our hands full, the family group chat is going to be the best way for us to share big milestones, shall I add you back? You can always silence it in case you\u2019re worried about too many texts.\u201d\n\nThis way, you and your husband are making it clear that if Mark wants to stay in your lives, he\u2019ll need to utilize the family chat, and not expect you guys to run him down each time, and you\u2019re offering an olive branch to your MIL, which I think could be helpful to your long game. If Mark says no, then your husband can say it\u2019s a standing offer, but he won\u2019t be able to promise regular updates given your busy lives.", "They did tell everyone who didn't actively opt out of receiving updates and news, too.  That's about as much as can be asked of people who literally just had a baby. Brother didn't want to get the news and he's pouting because he didn't get it.", "Absolutely. I get vibes of a covert narcissist, but do not have enough to be sure. The brother is definitely entitled, petulant, rage-filled, and selfish. That is my impression of him at least.", "Married 23 years and the same rule applies in our household. He manages his family and I manage mine. We don't always agree with the other's choices, but if his siblings/parents ask I redirect them to him. I also have a marriage where we do stand together.", "NTA. My issue is that Mark CHOSE to leave the group chat. That doesn't now mean that it's now on EVERYONE else to send a personal Mark-o-gram just to him. He chose to remove himself from the communication group, which means he is not going to get the communication, so he doesn't get to be mad at not getting the communication.", "Wonder what Mark is going to do when mom\u2019s no longer around to play messenger for him. Does he have a replacement lined up, or is he just going to brood over perceived slights in silence?", "Looks like the 38 year old sister is lining herself up!", "Maybe 38 y.o. sister should've conveyed said news."]}
