He got upset that I ate the food he was planning on taking for his lunch.  There is lots of other food in the fridge. He said he told his mom that he was taking the pizza for lunch and that I was greedy for eating it.  I asked him if he would be greedy for taking the pizza for lunch and he got pissy and left.   \n\nMy wife woke up when she heard us arguing.  She said that he had asked her and she had said yes.  I said great. Where is my dinner then.  She said she didn't make me anything since there were leftovers.  I asked her what leftovers and the lightbulb went off in her head.  She said she was sorry for not making me dinner.  I told her it wasn't her fault. There were leftovers. \n\nMy sin came back into the room and started arguing again that he had already claimed the leftovers for himself.  \n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. I asked him how much he paid for the food. $0. How much he paid in rent. $0. Utilities. $0.  \n\nWe are letting him live here so he can save money while he is in college.  \n\nBut I'm sick of this entitled little jerkoff. I told him if he had a problem with me eating \"his\" leftovers maybe he should move out so he can have his food safely stored away from me.  \n\nThen my wife says I'm taking it too far.  But he backed down pretty quick and said no that he was sorry for saying anything.  \n\nMy wife says I'm being an asshole for scaring him with kicking him out over some leftover pizza.  I'm not.

And then I went to work.  \n\nWhen I got home from my nightshift I went into the fridge and saw that there was still half a pizza left.  \n\nI warmed up three slices for my supper and watched some TV with my cat while I ate.  \n\nMy son got up before I went to bed and looked in the fridge.  He got upset that I ate the food he was planning on taking for his lunch.  There is lots of other food in the fridge. He said he told his mom that he was taking the pizza for lunch and that I was greedy for eating it.  I asked him if he would be greedy for taking the pizza for lunch and he got pissy and left.   \n\nMy wife woke up when she heard us arguing.  She said that he had asked her and she had said yes.  I said great. Where is my dinner then.  She said she didn't make me anything since there were leftovers.  I asked her what leftovers and the lightbulb went off in her head.  She said she was sorry for not making me dinner.  I told her it wasn't her fault. There were leftovers. \n\nMy sin came back into the room and started arguing again that he had already claimed the leftovers for himself.  \n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. I asked him how much he paid for the food. $0. How much he paid in rent. $0. Utilities. $0.  \n\nWe are letting him live here so he can save money while he is in college.  \n\nBut I'm sick of this entitled little jerkoff. I told him if he had a problem with me eating \"his\" leftovers maybe he should move out so he can have his food safely stored away from me.  \n\nThen my wife says I'm taking it too far.  But he backed down pretty quick and said no that he was sorry for saying anything.  \n\nMy wife says I'm being an asshole for scaring him with kicking him out over some leftover pizza.  I'm not.  I'm making sure he knows the best way to keep food that I paid for safe from me is to live elsewhere and buy your own food.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I understand being disappointed that the pizza was eaten, but throwing a little tantrum because he had to find a new option for lunch so you could eat food that you paid for?!?

That would be rude, but that\u2019s not really the circumstances of this story. The issue is that they all didn\u2019t discuss together who was going have the leftovers.

Grown adults don't scream at each other over a couple pieces of pizza. They're both acting like children here. One is actually a child.\n\nThis could have been easily solved by an \"oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you planned on taking that for lunch. Let's figure out something else.\"\n\nInstead he's teaching his son that middle of the night screaming matches are the appropriate adult reaction here.\n\nMy five and eight year olds will yell at each other over a piece of pizza. As parents we step in and explain to them that they're overreacting, and we work with them to find a compromise.

If there was a label, it would make it more murky because mum also had ok'd the decision.", "Oh absolutely in this case OP is NTA and anyone saying otherwise doesn't understand how to interact as an adult. But the anti-male bias on this sub is extremely strong. Wives are given a free pass for abhorrent behavior and even when she is clearly in the wrong the comments will bend over backwards and invent entire back stories to make him wrong. There's one that solidified it for me. The wife was horribly emotionally and verbally abusive, to the point where the husband and sons came up with a code to earn each other when she was on the warpath. The judgement? He was the asshole for not managing her mood better. That's the level of delusional the people here are capable of. Even in this one I guarantee you some people will be calling OP abusive and controlling for \"asking his wife what she was going to make him\". They will cling to that and ignore the rest of it. As long as they get to hate a man.", "That there's no reason to disrespect his son for raising him?!?", "Woah, woah, woah here.

Your son apparently does nothing to contribute to the household. Your wife (at least from what you've commented) seems to be an enabler. Yeah, you were kinda heavy with the threat to kick him out, but I suspect this isn't the first bullshit thing he's done.

And it sounds like she had to do most of the parenting which is tough. I work hard but I'm a Mom. My husband and I try to equally coparent as much as possible. Some jobs I understand it's not, but your attitude is very much like everyone \"owes\" you vs being a team. \n\nIt's not a healthy communication dynamic to take every little disagreement to 100 and resort to threats of abandonment.

And guess what, being someone\u2019s maid IS a full time job, even if your wife is being paid with a roof over her head.\nThis is 2023, not 1940.

I\u2019ll grab something else for lunch instead.\u201d Or if you\u2019re me, \u201cHey dad, while I may have forgotten that you hadn\u2019t eaten and that was technically gonna be my lunch, can I borrow/have a few dollars for lunch tomorrow?\u201d \n\nHe treated his son like any adult would treat another adult: Did you pay for this? Why didn\u2019t you wrap this up and put it away so everyone would know you claimed it? Did I not just work 12hrs so you could cry about the pizza that you can\u2019t take to lunch tomorrow? (Even though you\u2019ve already had some and I\u2019ve had nothing after my long ass shift of work?) Why is the son being greedy? Leftovers are for after EVERYONE has eaten said meal.

He got to the destination to find the work pants weren't there. (Because he had thrown them in the dirty clothes hamper without telling her, so she didn't see them.) He got annoyed and blamed her and people were flipping out on him because \"You're a grown adult, pack yourself!\" \n\nI was so confused because that's what couples do. They help each other out. He's not acting like a child because he had work to do and asked her to handle the packing for him to help out. I don't think he had the right to snap at her and blame her because it seemed like a miscommunication among chaos and if he hadn't put the pants where he did she probably would've seen them, but everyone was focusing on the fact that the wife packed for him and how he's using weaponized incompetence.", "....did you even read what he said? Like at all? He is out of the house working long hours, so that she could raise their son. He didnt dismiss her efforts. He said she was the primary parent raising their son.", "Ya know children can be ass's even with good parents.", "Nope.", "Why do you people think every old person ends up in a nursing home?

Really such a pathetic revenge scheme that seems so popular on this sub.", "Anyone else hear \u201cCat\u2019s in the Cradle\u201d playing softly in the background? No? Just me?", "I don't really care about \"the mind isn't developed\".\n\n22 year olds are still kids. They might not feel like it, I know I didn't when I was 22, but I most definitely was. They over react to things. They push boundaries. 18 year olds who go live in a dorm at college start learning to form adult boundaries with their peers. It's a learning process, just like any other. Smart parents start teaching their kids about setting adult appropriate boundaries before this, though, so that they're better prepared to be off on their own. It's pretty clear that OP hasn't done that, because some late night pizza set him off to this extent.\n\nOP is giving his son free room and board, probably has been for the past 22 years, and then wonders why his son isn't acting like a grown adult, when apparently his \"grown adult\" role model engages in screaming matches over pizza in the middle of the night. His son hasn't had the opportunity to be an independent adult living on his own, he's always been living at home as the kid. \n\nOP's son was upset about the pizza. Fine. Again, 22 year olds overreact to stuff, it's part of their nature. If OPs son had posted, I'd offer that he overreacted to the pizza and should have figured out something else. We can't deal with OPs son in this situation, though, we have to deal with OP. OP, as the parent, shouldn't be escalating this issue to a screaming match at any time, and definitely not in the middle of the night.\n\nOPs son acts like an \"entitled jerkoff\" probably because OP treats him like an \"entitled jerkoff\", and has not once actually treated him like a person.\n\nAs an adult, I can't imagine engaging in a screaming match over a piece of pizza, least of all with one of my kids. I couldn't imagine either of my parents doing that, or any of my wife's parents, or any of her siblings. The only adult in my life I could attribute behavior like that to would be my narcissitic alcoholic grandmother, who would be more than happy to yell at anyone and everyone over petty shit at the drop of a hat.", "She would have been better off having a career outside the home? What kind've world are you living in? It takes an hour to make dinner as opposed to 8 hrs on a 9-5. He is working so she can stay home and \"work\" far less. Even if you add on cleaning and laundry she is still doing WAY less. They don't have any babies to look after so I would say she has it pretty damn good compared to his 12 hr work days.", "Not so much about age as who provided the food. If a parent, getting \"permission\" from one of them to take it to work the next day is logical. \n\nGetting upset because your hungry dad ate the food when he didn't get a share before AND you didn't even give him a chance to ask you by not labelling it, is so entitled.", "Oh, i have no doubt that it varies significantly on locations. I know places like Chicago and NY who take their pizza very seriously are also much bigger. \n\nIt also probably has to do with the size of the cuts they make of the pizza. Our slices here are large, so they're only 8 slices. Cut in half, then half the other way. Then those 4 slices are each cut into 2.\n\nRegardless, there was still at least 1 piece the son could take, or he could use some of the money he's saving and buy his own lunch.", "Yep I remember that one. And while weaponized incompetence is most certainly a thing the way people treat any husband who isn't perfect on here is just straight up disturbing.\n\n The other day my wife and I were sitting on the couch. She got up and asked if I needed anything, I said sure a glass of water would be nice. She did a few things and came and sat back down without a glass of water, it slipped her mind while she was fussing with something else in the kitchen. So I decided to give her a little ribbing and mimed drinking and said \"thanks that was refreshing!\" With a little chuckle. This sub would tell you that I am the worst most self centered, controlling abusive person on the planet. When in fact it was just a small joke. This sub is completely obsessed with what you technically \"owe\" someone else. As if just doing a small thing out of kindness doesn't exist. And the way that shows across the genders paints an extremely clear picture of bigotry to anyone not deliberately missing the point.", "No, for sure the guy calling his kid an entitled little jerkoff is definitely not an asshole.", "Or, OR the son is acting entitled. Plain and simple. It is what it is. Let\u2019s not pretend that people don\u2019t get a little hangry about food they thought they were gonna have and didn\u2019t. Let\u2019s not pretend that the son hasn\u2019t had all the opportunities to be an independent adult and could have handled it as such. Just because you\u2019re living at home, doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re growth is stunted or that your parents are trying to keep you their little baby boo boo because you stay there rent free. And why are you so thirsty to paint the dad in a bad light because he was hungry after working to ensure that his child can save his money and only have to worry about school? Some parents, if they are in the position have no problems with their adult children staying with them and giving them their space to grow and learn and become better ADULTS. And stop pretending that ADULTS (especially parents and the kids they have) won\u2019t butt heads. A screaming match? Or was it really a disagreement? It\u2019s more than likely that the son is acting and feeling like he\u2019s grown and thought that speaking to his dad in a way he would speak to another adult was cool. Let\u2019s stop pretending that this is an insult to mankind and that this dad is the absolute worst. Like I said, the son is grown too and why folks are so bent on calling him a child is blowing me. Yes, he\u2019s THEIR child but he\u2019s not A child. He, again, has all the opportunities and boundaries of any other adult and still live at home. Doesn\u2019t make him a fuckin child. JFC\n\nThe dad is wrong because he wanted some of the pizza that he couldn\u2019t have earlier but the son is now stunted in his growth because he wanted that pizza and couldn\u2019t get it so he threw a tantrum and the dad is to blame? Or is the 22yr feeling himself and being a fuxkin brat, thinking he\u2019s grown, (he is) and decides to test those boundaries? A 22yr can overreact and push boundaries but his dad coming off of a 12hr shift at work, hungry asf can\u2019t? Why is that? Break it down to me like I\u2019m the child. Why and how is it ok to act like this at 22 but not the dad? Some folks haven\u2019t had the means to even go to college, let alone stay at home rent free or even have the chance to move out until they\u2019re in their 30\u2019s or married. Are they children because they didn\u2019t get the \u201cdorm life experience\u201d of making adult relationships? As if college and dorms are the only way to do it?", "Yes, it\u2019s always better to have financial autonomy than to live your live dependent on a person who doesn\u2019t value your contributions.\n\nIf OP\u2019s wife had a job, she could clock out every day and weekend. As it is, she\u2019s apparently on-call to her husband 24/7 for the rest of her life.", "It is when Dad didn't get his first serving of the food he bought. You can't claim someone else's share of food just because you label it.", "you got downvoted for saying this. maybe you should let them know you're a woman so that suddenly this comment becomes funny instead of offensive.", "yea the guy who bought the pizza and explained to his 22 son again, even after him realising the miscommunication, that its his pizza and can you use the other various foods to make his lunch."]}
