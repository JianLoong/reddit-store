My younger siblings still live with my mother. Until a year ago my dad was the one who brought the money home but he died in an accident and since my mom and him had a very traditional marriage she was a stay at home mom and all of a sudden had to take care of the money as well. And on top of that my sisters boyfriend left her when he found out she was pregnant. Meaning that my dad also paid everything for her as well. With him as a financial basis gone someone had to compensate it.\r  \n\r  \nAnd that was me. After I finished my studies I was able to attend a high paying job and I was able to save a huge amount of money for bad times. And both my mom and my sister asked me if I could help them out. And since I love them and want to help them I said yes and started to pay the bills for both of them. On the one side there was my mom with my younger brother and sister and on the other side was my big sister with my niece. Don't get me wrong I liked doing it at first because I liked the fact that I could help them but both of them promised me that they only need a bit of time to find a job and gave me a time span of maybe 1 - 2 months. These promises are now a year old and I ask them every month if they found something. They always try to find excuses like \"Oh the children have this and that and thats why I didn't have time to look for a job yet.\" And they say this everytime I ask.\r  \n\r  \nI even offered to pay someone to take care of the children for a while so they have time to look for a job and attend it but they refused. So I gave them an ultimatum. I told them that even though I love the help them I feel like they are using me. I told them I am going to pay their bills for the next three months and then cut my support off entirely except for the childrens education and healthcare. So by this time they have to find a job and I think that three months is enough time. I also offered again to pay someone to take care of the children while they are doing so but I want to them to take financial care of their children by themselves because if something happens to me as well they couldn't take care of the children anymore. And I don't want that.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I told both of them this they called it an \"asshole-behavior\" and that I couldn't understand because I don't have children. Which is true but again.

Where would you have time paying for someone else's problem\n\nYou need to cut contact, as they are going to keep trying to manipulate you", "NTA", "Why do you not want to give them cash? Is sending them money through payment services(Cash-app, Venmo) the same thing?", "Because if it's intended for food, they could spend it on something else that may not be a necessity. It's like when a homeless person asks for money to buy food... you buy the food, not give them money.", "NTA. They are making excuses and freeloading. I am a single parent of two children, one being special needs. I work full time and am still able to provide for them. Your sister should be getting at least child support for your niece. Many times that also includes the non-custodial parent to provide for insurance for the child. Social services can help with childcare finances while they work. I am also quite certain that at least your younger siblings could receive benefits from the government because of your father\u2019s death. \n\nThree months is plenty of time to find at least a minimum wage job. It may not be the job they want, but it will help pay bills.", "NTA you've been more than generous and for a long time. Closing the ATM and not doing what they want with your hard earned money doesn't make you the AH it makes them wake up and start taking responsibility.", "Nta. Not even close. The hard truth is though, as long as you keep giving money.... nothing will change", "NTA. You\u2019ve done more than enough already. They can\u2019t just expect you to just finance their whole lives while they do nothing to support themselves.", "NTA.  Sounds like dad raised them (and trained your mom) to be totally dependent on him and they transferred that dependence to you.  You have given them your deadlines, now stick to them.

Rich of them to say you don't understand cause you don't have kids when for all intents and purposes you're paying for their entire lifestyle.", "NTA.  Being a parent is not a good excuse to continue leeching off of you.

The audacity of them saying you don't have children, so you don't understand....but they do have children and don't seem to understand that it is their responsibility to take care of them and that means working, making money, and paying their own bills.", "Would be shocked if anyone at all thought you were the AH. This case is crystal clear, you're being taken advantage of and your course of action is quite agreeable. Three months is definitely enough to find something. Just a warning, if they're so shameless they call you the AH for not wanting to be exploited, they might try tricks like deliberately getting fired and then come back to you for money. Is there unemployment insurance in your country, or any other government services that could support them for a short period in such a situation so you don't have to? Or tell them they get one month for finding a new job if they happen to get fired. Or even contact the employer if you're suspicious. Good luck! I don't like the term due to overuse, but gaslighting seems appropriate here. Don't become unsure of yourself due to their entitled nonsense, you deserve better.", "NTA. And they could move together to support each other with shared bills and childcare, there is no reason why you should be the only one supporting in the first place.", "NTA full stop. You have done the most anybody could have asked of you by becoming a sole provider in the family. What would have happened if you were not a high earner? What will happen if you become sick or worse? I simply don\u2019t understand your mum & sister who don\u2019t want to be financially independent. You are doing the best for them by giving this (very generous) ultimatum", "NTA. 3 months is completely reasonable, especially since you mentioned their promises to get a job are a year old at this point. It's not as though you're giving them 3 weeks.Plus you're still giving options and solutions about the kids. It does sound like they're using you. Not everyone Wants to work but they can't be so entitled to refuse to work.", "Nta. Don\u2019t give them another cent, you can put away money for the kids to have once they of age, but don\u2019t give the freeloaders anything!", "NTA- you are being used. It\u2019s generous to offer to cover childcare while they job hunt, then refusing proves they never had any intention of getting jobs. Your mom and sister chose to have kids, actions mean responsibility and it\u2019s THEIR responsibility to pay for their children.", "NTA - You are kind and generous.  The good news is you have some money to track down the deadbeat sperm donor and start making him pay for his child, I believe this is called courts and attorneys and what he owes for not handling his \"business\" correctly.  This should eliminate one half of the 'issue'.  Next step is to help mom find a part time gig to care for the house.  Then set up a spreadsheet of bills, income, spending money in a very basic spreadsheet that your mom can use to learn how to manage finances.  'Issue' number two solved.  This is just a me sentence to every single mom and every single person who says \"she should stop having kids\"   YES and NO...Sperm dad needs to pay up and not be able to just disappear with no recourse.  I have read multiple single mom stories and all blast her but not him.  WTF!", "NTA\n\nWhat do they want you do to support them forever?\n\n\n You're not dad.

Halfway through reading that, I thought, \u201cyou have to cut them off.\u201d They are absolutely using you.", "You should pay forever.  This is their solution", "NTA - you have been beyond generous and patient with both of them and instead of adjusting to life as it is they opted to get comfortable thinking they can guilt trip you into supporting their lifestyles forever\n\nCutting them off is the best thing for them and yourself.", "They are using you and will do it as long as you let them.

You\u2019re NTA. \n\nJust because they don\u2019t like something it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.

Tell them exactly that. \n\nLock up your accounts and passwords and make sure you stick to your 3 month terms.  Be prepared for them to continue to try and cry and avoid working. Also be on the lookout for them trying to take your money without your permission. Their entitlement sounds pretty bad - and it can make people do some horrible things to people that they \u201clove\u201d.", "NTA\n\nYou need to ask them what their plan is if you get hit by a bus tomorrow and aren't there to pay their way.\n\nYou're being incredibly generous in giving them a boost up and onto their own two feet. They need to be able to support themselves and their children. Time to stop acting like spoiled children and start being adults.", "Damn I would cut off help immediately if they called me an asshole.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAs parents they have the responsibility to provide for their kids; refusing to get jobs is entirely on them.\n\nRefusing to get jobs and expecting you to continually financially supporting them (and insulting you when you are going to reduce that support) is being an asshole.\n\nYou are not a replacement for your father.", "Lol, NTA.  Go ahead show them what real \"asshole-behavior\" is.", "Ok, thanks for explaining it to me. I was thinking it was more of a gaslighting thing where they would tell OP that they did not send money when in fact they did.

What you did at the start was very kind and what good families do in times of trouble when they can afford it.  You do need to reflect that your sister was already being funded by someone else (your father) before so is very comfortable with her current arrangements.

Giving them money means they can choose what food, or if theyd rather have a water bottle, blanket, tarp, etc. Its a really common thing for people to give food - but as someone who works with those folks daily - you can only eat so many free meals of fast food a day.
