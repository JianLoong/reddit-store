It's not that much work. And you sleep in them every night. Do you know the amount of sweat and skin particles and mites and stuff are in them? That's disgusting.\n\nIf you are too sick to do it yourself, pay for a maid or make some other arrangements. \n\nIf you can't live on your own (and living on your own includes being able to vacuum and do laundry or being able to have someone else do it for you), don't have an apartment. If you can do it, don't make your mum come over to do this.\n\nAlso stop hiding your gf from your family.", "YTA - To yourself. Washing your sheets can be beneficial to your skin. If you have bad acne, this is probably a good reason why. Also, why would you want to sleep in all of that built up bodily trash? Fluids, dead skin cells etc. and then your GF (probably?) sleeping on that too is unsanitary.", "So you roughly slept on those sheets for over 500 days and never ever washed them for a single time? \n\nYTA tho it's not only about sheets.", "YTA. If you\u2019re old enough to have a girlfriend, you\u2019re old enough to wash your sheets and not depend on your mother to do that for you. Also, gross. How did you never think to wash your sheets?", "You are disgusting dude \ud83e\udd22", "YTA....surely you know the answer.", "Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww *takes breath* wwwwwww\nYTA but it's not the sheets. \n\nYou've been sick for over a year? Or is this just a new excuse?", "YTA for how you're treating your girlfriend. Saying it's because you have a \"traditional family\" sounds like you're defending their bigotry. You're gross and sad for not washing your sheets. I'm guessing your mom does all your laundry? Grow up.", "YTA.\n\nEven if you only sleep in them once a week it\u2019s been two years - so approx 100 nights you\u2019ve slept there and approx 24 times with your gf in there too, I\u2019m surprised the sheets didn\u2019t walk out your apartment of their own volition \ud83e\udd22\n\nAlso; your argument with your gf isn\u2019t about the sheets", "INFO: Why didn't you wash them?", "idk if you can be an asshole for not washing your sheets but its gross. atleast once a month dude, like i get it, its annoying but still, you can't live like this.", "Bloody hell, you haven't washed your sheets in 2 YEARS??? \n.... I have no words. \nAlso how can your mother not like your GF if she never met her?", "Barf. That's so gross.  Yta and a disgusting one at that.  Grow up.", "You have to wash sheets about once a week, even if you don't sleep there every night, this is just dirty. Have you really slept on the same sheets for two years without washing them? YTA\r  \n\r  \nIt's also strange that you haven't introduced your girlfriend to your parents after a year. And that your mother has to clean your house. How old are you? 14?", "I wouldn't say you're an AH if that's how you want to live. But to have someone else sleeping in your bed assume you wash your sheets on a regular basis is pretty rational. I'm not sure how you'd even bring that up in conversation to let them know that you don't wash your sheets, but I'd imagine after too long they'd start to smell and it would be noticeable.", "So you own an apartment, that you didn't have to pay for. But you live with your mother because she feeds you three meals a day. When you had relatives visit, your mother did all the housework. You say you've been sick and needed more help, but I would put money on you being pretty lazy and strategically incapable of basic household functions all the time. \n\nYou were an AH before your lack of hygeine surfaced. \n\nYTA", "Let me guess, the reason your mum doesn't like her is that your girlfriend isn't willing to take over caring for you like you are a 5 year old?\n\nYTA", "YTA. That's gross. Your mattress must be disgusting. \n\nYour mom is also TA for not teaching you to be self sufficient.\n \nAs a general rule of thumb you should have 3 sets of sheets. One on the bed, one in the hamper, and one clean in the drawer. I would recommend buying cotton sheets as they are easy to care for ( just throw them in the washer and then the dryer). For hygiene purposes you should be changing your sheets once a week. \n\nYour comforter can be washed about every 4-6 weeks.\nBuy yourself a mattress protector. Before you put it on the bed, febreeze your mattress and let it dry. \n\nTo show your girlfriend that you are not disgusting, buy a throw pillow with a saying or picture that you like and make your bed before she comes over. Top your bed off with a throw blanket in a coordinating color stretched out longways across the foot of the bed.", "AH? No. Dirty as fuck? Absolutely.", "NAH- not washing your sheets doesn\u2019t making you an asshole, but it does make you disgusting. Grown ass people not knowing how to take care of themselves is a huge turnoff. My boyfriends mom always did his laundry and when he moved in, I told him he would be doing his own. I am not his mother and I\u2019m not going to parent him, learn how to do laundry. I\u2019m always surprised how people aren\u2019t embarrassed to admit they\u2019re basically a glorified child", "Considering you were gifted an apartment and old enough to stay there 5-6 times per week for 2 years, I'll say you're at least 20 years old.\n\nSo you're definitely a slob for not washing your sheet since you got them, the AH part would depend on how much time your gf has been spending sleeping in your dirty sheets.", "You aren't an asshole... you are disgusting. Wtf is wrong with you?", "YTA for not washing your sheets for TWO years. I know it smells VILE in there", "You haven't washed your sheets in 2 FUCKING YEARS??? Gross gross gross. YTA.", "Gross, and it's pathetic and entitled that you need your mommy to come over and do basic things.  You gonna marry your mom?  If not, you might want to consider developing some adult skills and responsibility.  YTA.", "Not not the sheets. \n\nBut yta for not  introducing girlfriend to your family for over a year.", "YTA. Imagine not washing your sheets for two years \ud83e\udd22", "Info: what is the reason you hadn't washed your sheet before? What is the reason your gf hasn't met your parents? Does your mom not like her? Why? It appears they haven't met...", "ew wash your sheets stinky", "YTA, and a spoiled dirty brat.", "Yeah YTA. Lazy and not to mention disgusting.", "I\u2019m confused. You have an apartment you were gifted but stay with your mom 5-6 nights a week and instead of cleaning up after yourself like an adult you have your mom come and clean for you to the point you won\u2019t even wash your own linen? Sounds like GF is calling you the AH because you lack basic responsibility which segwayed into her realizing you\u2019re not serious about your relationship. So yes, YTA.", "YTA for letting your mother do literally everything for you. Also, is your girlfriend sleeping in that bed sometimes? If so and you haven\u2019t washed the sheets in 2 years that is disgusting.", "YTA. Wash your sheets.", "YTA. It sounds like there\u2019s a whole lot more going on than just your nasty ass sheets though.", "Info: is it just you who sleeps in the bed? If so then NAH but it is still pretty grim.\n\nLike once every 2-3 weeks is okay and not that much effort.", "N TA for not washing sheets... but YTA for having a gf that is clearly upset about a situation and wants to communicate, but somehow you think it's about dirty sheets ?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You may have the excuse of being sick right now but what is your excuse overall? How do you go 2 years without  washing your sheets?!? That's so disgusting! I have health issues and between low energy and pain it's hard for me to stay on top of things. Even with all that, my sheets get changed weekly. I keep a spare part in case I don't feel enough to strip the bed and throw them in the wash the same day. Sounds like you need to do the same. \n\nYou have to understand that you are sweating copious amounts of sweat onto those sheets on a daily basis, then there's the dead skin that sloughs off, & then there's the dust mites that come to live & thrive in your dirty sheets. If you and your gf are being intimate then add those fluids to the mix. \n\nThis is so unhygienic and nasty, you seriously need to read up about what you've been sleeping in. If you aren't willing you change your habits I would be out of there if I were your gf. This would be a dealbreaker. Not only because it's gross but because it shows such a level of immaturity that it's concerning.  \n\nWhy is your mother cleaning your apt. for guests instead of you? You are a grown assed person behaving like a child. You need to take responsibility for yourself and stop expecting others to do the things you don't want to do. Do you think your mom wants to come clean your place when she has her own place to care for? Of course not! If this is a one time thing because you're sick, that's great she could help out. But since you're admitting to not changing  your sheets I have to assume you don't do much cleaning at all. This is a basic part of life, you need to grow up and start behaving like an adult. Part of being an adult is cleaning and taking care of YOUR home.", "Ihhh it has been 2 years?!?! Gross and then why does your mum need to do your sheets and clean for you!
