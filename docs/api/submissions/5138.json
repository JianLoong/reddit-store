Before you put it on the bed, febreeze your mattress and let it dry. \n\nTo show your girlfriend that you are not disgusting, buy a throw pillow with a saying or picture that you like and make your bed before she comes over.

Two years!? And it only happened because mommy came over and did basic beginning level house cleaning.\n\nHow alarming to find out you've been dating someone whose bed has had 2 years worth of bodily fluids on it.

Your skin flakes, no matter how moisturized you are.", "Honey! Sweat is only part of the equation here - and you probably do sweat in your sleep more than you realize.
