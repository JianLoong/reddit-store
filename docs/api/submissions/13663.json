You're doing absolutely the right thing and here's why: My late husband had exactly the same tendency towards reckless spending and also had an alcohol problem and other  addictions.  He sadly passed away in his 50's and it was only afterwards that I fully realised that the reckless spending and the other addictive behaviours are all linked and can be symptoms of depression and anxiety.  They were all giving him the temporary hit that he needed to feel better in that moment but then made him feel even more depressed afterwards.  Your BIL might need some help with the same issues.", "NTA, you were brutally honest and blunt, but he asked for your opinion. If he didn't want to hear it, he shouldn't have asked.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve seen this acquisition behavior in addicts and hoarders. The sad thing is after getting that watch he probably won\u2019t care about it at all. It is all about the fix of obtaining it. \n\nHe needs to get his wife a new car.  No real man wants their family dragging around in the worst vehicle they own. I make A LOT of money but you would never know it by looking at me or my old pickup. My wife though - she has a brand new car with backup cameras and lane assist lights. Those are great safety features, and I want my family to have them. My family is my pride, not me.", "Well you only told those things because he asked your opinion, and you were too damn right. NTA.", "NTA\n\nSometimes people need to hear the truth. \n\nBut in future, I wouldn't talk about anything you have experience with. Just say \"I'm not comfortable discussing it\". ANYTHING you say he will use as a reason to indulge himself. Just grey rock him, every time. \n\nYou should also consider (if you haven't already) offering to help your sister find a therapist for herself. She needs a reality check if she's driving her child around in an unsafe car while paying for a nice car for your BIL.", "NTA, he asked, you answered.

Of course you care for their well-being", "NTA. if you can't buy two Rolexes, you shouldn't but one. \n\nDude's acting like a kid with money to burn because he's been enabled. You were right to call him out. Your sister has some ownership, too.

Doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re going to save him or the family by this one intervention but he asked and you were honest. Would you have slept at night if you\u2019d supported him getting it?", "NTA Maybe he has a spending addiction. He should be in a program or in therapy. He needed to hear the truth from someone and you spoke up.", "NTA. You told him the truth as you saw it. One commenter said it wasn't your business but I disagree. It's about your sister and nephew. You're very much within your familial rights to speak up. \n\nSo definitely NTA, but *please* have a serious talk with your sister about leaving this relationship. That cannot be a good environment for her child to grow up in and it sounds awful for her too. \n\nEven if for whatever reason you don't feel compelled to help *your sister* leave, that child deserves better and it seems his mother is currently not in a state of mind to make it happen.", "NTA oh no no, you could not have been expected to just give him luxury watch buying advice in this situation. And your sister goes along with his impulse buys because it \u201creduces their fighting\u201d eeeeeek. I feel very sorry for your sister. This all sounds like a terrible situation for her to be in.", "NTA, my god your sister deserves so much better\n\nWhat a selfish narcissistic man to put his wants ahead of his family\u2019s needs", "Any mention of debt, you shouldn\u2019t be buying anything until that\u2019s gone no matter what. Your sister needs to stop enabling him, especially with the truck payments. How can he not afford a truck, but can afford a Rolex?", "NTA.  You cannot save your BIL from himself.  He refuses help, yet he expects others to coddle/support him.  Your sister is enabling and making excuses for her husband.  Very concerning that she is driving an unsafe vehicle with a baby.  I'm fearful for the baby and the \"fighting.\"   Is he physically abusive in addition to mentally abusive?  Have a heart-to-heart discussion with your sister, and offer her a way out if she needs one.  \n\nDo not give BIL money.  I'm not even going to call him an AH as he obviously has mental health and addiction issues.", "NTA, but - \n\nYou sure this guy is clean? I'm a former addict and everything you said sounds like he's in active addiction, and hiding again. Someone in serious recovery would be humble enough to know they NEED constant therapy and vigilance, and would be more worried about making things up to their friends and family than impulse buying shit. \n\nOr dude's having a manic episode, idk. But I've seen his type 1000 times and it's never different. My own ex stopped paying our mortgage for over 3 months and I only found out when we got kicked out; thought he was clean for a year. Clown behavior. I feel bad for the child.", "NTA. You have every right to speak up on the behalf of your sister and especially, your nephew. And I personally don't think you went to far with talking about the car. I am married to a \"car guy\" and we have a 15 1/2 year old daughter. and his main criteria for a car for her when she gets her license in six months is safety. He looks up the car fax on every damn vehicle and will not buy one that has been in an accident and may not be as sctructurely sound or in general, does not have good crash test ratings. and yes, we are downsizing our vacation this year and thinking about other non-essentials that we don't need to buy, because her safety is more important than \"things\" or luxury vacations.", "NTA. Someone needed to stand up for his family, if it\u2019s not going to be his wife, then I guess it had to be you.", "Wow, your sister has set an extremely low bar... and he continues to underperform.

(I come from a long line of alcoholics)\n\nThere is a reason he was addicted to cocaine, and without therapy (which he is refusing) he will continue with the addict mind by transferring his addiction because he isn't getting to the root cause of his problem.\n\nIf he continues to refuse therapy, I'd suggest he use the paddleboard he impulsively bought and at least channel his energy into something productive instead of spending tbh", "NTA - sometimes people need reality checks.", ">He has a nice truck with a $600/month payment that his wife, my sister (36) makes the payments on.
