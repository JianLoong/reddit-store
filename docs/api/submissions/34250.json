Your stepmom should stay out of this mess and make her own 3 children bond among them, but encouraging the last 2 to bond with you and your brother. That is the least unfair option here.

You act like the OP did something big and cruel obviously to her to siblings or step mother. But following traditions is not cruel yes she could possibly put in more effort to do more family related stuff but the more you try to force family on someone the less real that feeling becomes until the point where you question what is family even for.", "Why are you focused on my response instead of focusing on the OP. Give her your version of the advice. You're not convincing me to have a different opinion.\n\nSo thank you for your feedback, have a lovely day.", "Eh to be honest that was both.
