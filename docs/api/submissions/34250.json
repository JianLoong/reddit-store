And your stepmom, she doesn't get to have an opinion on this matter, she is not related to you or your brother.\n\n  She has no right to try to dictate this, she's just your Dad's wife.", "NTA\n\nMan, that\u2019s a lot to go through and I\u2019m sorry. Really, you seem to be pretty level headed and dealing as best anyone could expect of you. I\u2019m sure your Mom would be proud. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason your brother didn\u2019t have contact with anyone else. Whatever it may be, it\u2019s likely significant. Which says a great deal about your Dad and Stepmom. \n\nLook, the way you and your brother feel about each other is a wonderful thing. Why adults can\u2019t seem to understand that these kinda of feelings can\u2019t be manufactured or forced I don\u2019t know. \n\nI\u2019m sure they wish you felt like this with everyone else. That\u2019s a valid thing to wish for, but they also can\u2019t lay that burden on you to fulfill. You obviously don\u2019t feel like that.\n\nIt\u2019s OK you don\u2019t feel like that. \n\nYou can love whomever you love. Your family is whomever makes you feel like family. \n\nYour Dad and Stepmother are wrong. They can\u2019t force you to feel feelings you don\u2019t have and they can\u2019t blame you for their unrealistic expectations about how their family is in their own heads. \n\nA good phrase to remember is \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way, but I can\u2019t change the way I feel\u201d. \n\nI hope you get through the next couple of years ok. You sound like a good kid. Don\u2019t let them get you down.", "NTA\n\nHave you thought about having a little family meeting with the other kids and no adults? Or maybe one on one sibling meetings? Explain that you care about them, love them, whatever you feel and that they are your family. You lost your mom at a young age and that was really difficult. Your brother is the only sibling you have that shares both your dad and the mom you lost. He is very important to you but that doesn't mean that they are not valued as well. Just like they have family that you don't share you have family they don't. Your brother doing things for you is part of your unique sibling relationship. He is not related to them so they won't have that relationship and that's okay.", "NTA You've had too many people in and out of your life for them to try and pull you away from the one person you've bonded with. Ask them if they think people can be forced to love each other.", "NTA. It\u2019s super cute that you have such a great relationship with your brother.", "NTA.  You feel how you feel.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.  You can\u2019t change it, and no matter what your dad and stepmom do or say - they can\u2019t change it either.  \n\nSo if you should not have said that - did they want you to LIE?", "NTA your time is your time. Spend it however you wish.", "ESH\n\nI get that parents can't force their kids to have relationships. But that doesn't mean you have to make the younger siblings feel excluded and unwanted.\n\nAlso, your dad may be annoyed with your brother due to the fact he tried to adopt him, and brother seems to reject his attempts on keeping yal 2 together. Your dad also loves you and why he doesn't want you to leave.", "Are.... are you living a Disney movie???", "Its interesting that your dad is _aware_ that if he lets you stay with your brother that may mean you reduce/ cut contact with his family. So he realises how you're feeling but still makes ridiculous demands and has ridiculous expectations and essentially pushes you away despite the fact that may make you cut contact anyway once you turn 18.\n\nAnd why does he and his wife expect your brother to buy their kids stuff??? Your brother and you are connected by your mother, he shares no DNA/ relationship with your step/ half siblings and has no obligation to buy them stuff.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If possible, it might help to sit down with just your dad and explain why you have a bigger emotional attachment to your brother than your other half/step siblings.\n\nFirst, you and your brother have shared memories of your mom. That is a connection your other siblings can never possibly have with you. That is something special that just you and your brother share, and it makes you feel closer in that way. You developed Christmas traditions, birthday traditions, etc with him and your mom that existed before your other half siblings and step sibling came into your life. \n\nSecond, you\u2019ve known him longer. You have had longer to develop an emotional bond with him. \n\nThird, you never had an adequate amount of time to grieve your mother\u2019s loss before a new mother-figure was placed before you as a grieving child. Your brother provides stability and someone you could go where life wasn\u2019t different, where a new mother figure wasn\u2019t being forced into your life before you could handle it. \n\nI honestly think your dad needs to go to family therapy with you, because he doesn\u2019t seem to understand the vast intricacies of how to handle (1) the impact of a child losing their parent at a young age and (2) the impact of a child who lost a parent being forced into a new blended-family dynamic.", "> Their disagreement led to me being told again a few days later that I was behaving badly and shouldn't have said what I did. AITA?\n\n\u201cWould you have preferred a lie?\u201d\n\nNTA", "Nta i just had the same argument with my family", "NTA. Your dad isn\u2019t related to your brother at all, if I read your post correctly OP. Which means none of your other siblings are either, in any way. So he\u2019s not obligated to spend time with them, let alone spend money on them.", "NTA, they brought it on themselves. Love your brother how you see fit. If they don't like it...forget them it's your life.", "NTA, but your dad and step mother sure sound like major ones... that is your brother, you've known him your entire life and it's not fair for them to just say you need to stop seeing him.\n\nAt the end of the day it's your choice, regardless of being 15... he plays a much larger part of your life as opposed to your other step-siblings of whom I'm sure you barely know.", "Some people can not be without a romantic partner. They just can not be alone.   I find that incredibly odd. But i can take care of myself and i like myself so i can be alone and be ok.\n\n\n\nBut yeah i know a few people that just get married really fast that legit were not cheating on any level. They just cant be by themselves.", "Dad gets very little credit for being currently self aware, but ultimately it was his actions and inactions allowed the situation to be what it is.

So I\u2019m the only one who thinks it sounds unhealthy?", "I have two sisters. One is a couple years younger than me and the other is 7 years younger than me. When I was OP's age, I didn't want anything to do with my youngest sister who would have been 8 at the time. It didn't mean I didn't love my youngest sister, but I was a teenager and she was a child. My other sister and I shared a common friend group since we were so close in age. I get the feeling OP may have the same disposition here towards her half siblings. Especially, since they are most likely between 8-10 years old or younger.\n\nAlso, my dad has had 2 wives since my mom and him divorced. I have always referred to them as my dad's wives and never my stepmom. Doesn't mean I called them that. It also doesn't mean I treated them poorly.", "If his wife worked, he may be getting a SS check monthly for keeping her.", "This is definitely not on the same level as you but my dad remarried 4 months after my parents divorced. He did it because he does not know how to live without a woman taking care of him. Maybe the same thing happened here a bit? This is obviously no excuse just curious.", "INFO:  Do you have contact with your maternal grandparents?  Do your dad and his wife make you babysit?  Do you have plans for college or something when you turn 18 (or possibly earlier)?  Do you know if your dad gets a check from Social Security (death benefits) for you because of your mom (if she worked before she passed)?  I\u2019m sorry for your loss and delighted you have an excellent brother.", "Um, he def was having an affair. It doesn\u2019t happen that quickly", "what is the hold up with moving out? would popo really do much?", "I bet she'd start caring when she learns she might lose OP's dependent check from social security if he goes to live with his brother.....", "Maybe show your dad this post?  So he gets a clue that his priority should be what\u2019s best for you", "Legally, sure. Is your dad the type to call the cops on you if you start spending weeks at a time at your brothers house? Start slowly, and just... do it. That's how being an adult works, but you seem like you know this already. \n\nBe happy, shitty people arent worth the time bro", "Oh, sorry, you are right!

Forget my first post!\n\nNTA, but try to go out on special time with the kids once in a while, and yes, your brother has nothing to do with those kids.", "OP believes her siblings from her father is less than her brother from her mom.

But at least she recognizes that OP already had one foot out the door and the second the clock strikes 18 OP is outta there.  She seems to have decided to drop the rope.", "Dude clearly has her best interest at heart. He let her spend the holidays with her brother, and I doubt that's what he wanted. He just refusing to let her move out because he's still her father and probably wants to be in her life.", "If he loved his kid, hooking up with a new woman only two months after his previous wife was buried would not have happened.  OP has not said it out loud.  But she clearly has a very damaged relationship with him.", "You have a kind heart.  Thanks for a different perspective.", "I think that's a dumb take personally. Everyone grieves differently and the father life shouldn't be put on hold till the daughter okay with him dating. Yeah they married fast but without knowing why or how it all happened, it's not really our concern or hers for that matter.   \n\n\nThe father obviously is trying and it's clear from OP post that her life isn't horrible or even bad. Like it be one thing if he forced her to stay home for the holidays but he didnt. So realistically this is just basic teenage drama that isn't really an issue.   \n\n\nWill she have a good relationship with the stepmom, who knows but I'm willing to bet she will have a good one with her father and she grows up more.   \n\n\nCould the family use some therapy, yeah for sure.

Tell her about how much you agree with her. At least both of you are on the same page and she may ease off of you.\n\nIt could also make things worse if she ends up resenting OP\u2019s dad for not letting OP move out when he\u2019s the only one who doesn\u2019t want it, and she has told him to let OP go. If she sees it as proof that Dad is prioritizing keeping OP at the expense of her children, she could hate OP for that.", "I know they are separate relationships. But I don't have the same wish for a closer relationship with them like I do with my brother.", "People in the top comments were quite rightfully asking if the stepmother was a side piece that the dad had been dating before OP's mom died.

Since her mom passed several years ago and stepmom came into her life a year later, seems like this may have been going on since then. OP is well in her rights to feel what she feels and is probably clinging to her brother because he is her only sanctuary from her toxic family. OP needs help and he is there and providing it for her. Why wouldn't he be her most favorite person?", "For my dad, he is a very personable, friendly guy just completely useless lol and the step-mom was the divorcee so I think she was in a period of vulnerability too. They also both like to spend past their means so I'm sure it was very fun at first lol", "What favoritism? Why do y\u2019all add in shit that doesn\u2019t exist?", "I'm not sure it was two months.  OP isn't clear as to whether they got together 2-3 months after the death, or whether the marriage was 2-3 months after dad and stepmom met.
